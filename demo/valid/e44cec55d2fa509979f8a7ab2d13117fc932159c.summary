the @entity1 government has declared the @entity3 to be the new battlefield in its fight against " pornography and unlawful information			1
" the chilling reality is that the main casualty of this cyberwar is freedom of expression			0
@entity1 's internet model is one of extreme control			1
the authorities use an army of censors to stifle dissent			2
in january , the orwellian " @entity26 " announced it had shut down scores of websites and more than 100 social media accounts for " distorting history of the @entity24 and the nation			0
" under the guise of a campaign to ensure social stability , the @entity1 authorities suppress online debate on a range of legitimate issues			1
dozens of phrases are censored on social media including any mention of the 1989 @entity39 crackdown or the recent @entity41 pro-democracy protests			0
thousands of websites , including @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 remain blocked			0
while the new battlefield is virtual , the impact on people 's lives is real and devastating			1
since president @entity52 came to power , hundreds of people have been detained solely for expressing their peaceful views online			1
it is women 's rights activists , anti-corruption and environmental campaigners , and those urging debate on political and legal reforms who fall foul of online censors			1
@entity65 was detained by police in october 2014			0
her apparent " crime " was to have posted comments online in support of @entity41 's pro-democracy protests			1
she faces charges of " inciting subversion of state power , " and a potential sentence of life imprisonment			0
@entity76 , a 45 - year - old mother and grassroots activist , languishes in jail right now			0
last june , she was sentenced to six years in prison on the charge of " picking quarrels and provoking troubles " for publicly calling on the @entity1 government to step up the fight against corruption			1
@entity76 's online posts of photos of her holding banners calling for transparency , and transcripts of @entity92 chats with foreign media , were used to condemn her at her trial			1
the paradox is that president @entity52 has made great mileage out of his own anti-corruption drive			0
the persecution of @entity76 , and many others that raise these issues only underlines the hypocrisy of the current leadership			2
this online attack is part of the worst crackdown against freedom of expression in @entity1 in more than a decade			1
under president @entity52 , it is an assault on all fronts : in academia , in the media , civil society and online			2
@entity115 , an economics professor at @entity116 in @entity117 and the founder of the " @entity120 " website was sentenced to life imprisonment in september 2014 on charges of " separatism			0
" the charge was based on his online articles , university lectures and interviews with foreign media			2
he worked to peacefully build bridges between ethnic communities and often criticized government policies that promoted discrimination			0
i have not seen evidence that his words did otherwise			0
the @entity1 authorities abuse the law to suppress online freedom and target critical voices , yet have the guile to portray such persecution as evidence of the rule of law in action			1
far from relenting , the government is introducing a swath of regressive legislation and regulations in a further assault against online privacy and freedom of expression			2
a new , vaguely worded draft anti-terror law lacks sufficient safeguards and gives the authorities virtually a free rein to collect information on individuals ' online activities			2
all @entity3 and telecommunication service providers operating in @entity1 would be required to give the government backdoor access to their systems and details about the encryption used			2
yes , the government has a responsibility to ensure national security and to combat serious crime , but such measures must be targeted and proportionate to the threat			0
internet companies doing business in @entity1 must also take all possible efforts to avoid contributing to human rights abuses			1
at the international level the @entity1 government looks to legitimize its actions			2
@entity1 's charismatic " internet czar , " @entity177 , extolls the concept of " internet sovereignty " and promotes it as an acceptable global model			1
this initiative must not go unchallenged			0
internet sovereignty in @entity1 equals censorship and persecution ; a web to trap thousands of individuals peacefully expressing different views online			1
while the immediate outlook is bleak , there is hope			0
the @entity3 has proved invaluable to the development of human rights -- revolutionizing access to information and improving transparency and accountability			0
for every online critic the @entity1 authorities imprison , there are scores more prepared to speak out despite the risks			1
it is with these courageous individuals that those of us who value online freedom must stand united			0
the battle to promote @entity3 sovereignty and silence all critical voices is one the @entity1 authorities must not be allowed to win			1
the opinions expressed here are solely those of the author			0
