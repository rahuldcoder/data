@entity4 during his upcoming speech to @entity3 , @entity1 prime minister @entity0 will lay out the details of what he understands to be the nuclear agreement between world powers and @entity10 , hoping it will prompt lawmakers to question the administration and delay the march 24 deadline for a political agreement			1
a senior @entity1 official traveling in @entity0 's delegation , who was not authorized to speak on the record , said the @entity1 government had " a good understanding of the agreement we can draw conclusions from			1
" " we know what we know			0
and believe me , we know a lot of information about this agreement , " the official told reporters aboard the flight to @entity4			0
" the prime minister is going to @entity3 to explain what they do n't know about this agreement that it is a bad agreement			1
" will speech backfire ? the official said @entity3 has " no understanding " of the deal shaping up			1
he described the prime minister 's speech as a " last chance " to speak directly to @entity3 before a march 24 deadline for a political framework agreement about the elements believed to be in the deal			1
the official would not disclose how the @entity1 government reportedly had more information on the deal than the @entity3 , but noted that many of the parties were leaking details of the talks			1
however , in congressional testimony before a @entity54 subcommittee last week , secretary of state @entity51 said , " anybody running around right now jumping in to say , ' well , we do n't like the deal ' or this or that , does n't know what the deal is			2
there is no deal yet			2
and i caution people to wait and see what these negotiations produce			0
" the official suggested @entity0 would urge lawmakers in his tuesday address to pressure the @entity71 administration to push the deadline so more discussion can take place about what he perceives is a dangerous deal that leaves @entity10 with the ability to develop a nuclear weapon down the line			1
" there is no sacred date , " the official said of the march 24 deadline			0
" it can be put off			0
they can change it " the official said that as the march 24 deadline approaches , @entity0 will warn " be careful of giving up compromises			1
they are compromises and they are not good			0
" @entity71 hinted last week that he did not see the need for any additional extensions , saying the talks have , " sufficiently narrowed and sufficiently clarified that we 're at the point where they need to make a decision			0
" that deadline was agreed to by the five parties and @entity10 , which is why @entity51 is having marathon meetings with the @entity10 foreign minister @entity101 in @entity102 beginning again this week			1
6 questions about @entity0 's visit @entity0 spoke with @entity51 on the eve of his trip , the official said , adding that despite the fraught political tone of @entity0 's visit , the @entity108 and @entity1 continue to communicate through intelligence channels			2
intelligence and national security officials , this official said , met last week with national security adviser @entity113 and @entity114 , the lead @entity108 negotiator for the @entity10 talks			2
