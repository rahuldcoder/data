@entity1 actress @entity0 made an impassioned plea to women around the world : " do n't let anyone tell you what you can or can not do , or can not achieve			1
" just do n't allow it			2
be what you want to be -- and prove them wrong			0
" the emotional @entity16 star took to the stage at @entity19 's headquarters in @entity20 on sunday , march 8 , to talk about gender equality as part of @entity24 celebrations			1
@entity2 was among the live audience of around 150 people -- with millions more watching the live stream across the world -- as the 24 - year - old @entity29 spoke about her own feminist journey			0
@entity0 's @entity19 moment of the dozens gathered at the event , the majority were bespectacled young men -- not so unlike @entity16 himself			1
describing the " surreal " moment she gave a speech at @entity40 headquarters , later watched by 17 million , @entity0 said : " gender equality historically has been a woman 's movement			1
" and how it 's affecting men has n't been addressed , " she told moderator @entity44			2
during the hour - long conversation , @entity0 gave the audience a rare glimpse into her private life -- and the difference between chivalry and sexism			1
" i love having the door opened for me , is n't that just polite ? " she said			0
" but i think the key is , would you then mind me opening the door for you ? " " @entity59 should be consensual			0
" and it 's not just women affected by gender inequality -- men suffer too , she added			1
" i get disturbed by this idea that men ca n't cry , " she continued			2
" they ca n't express themselves and i think that 's the saddest thing in the world			0
being able to express yourself is what makes you human -- it 's not what makes you a girl			0
" when internet trolls threatened to release naked photos of the actress , following her @entity40 speech , she said it only made her more determined in her campaign			2
" if they were trying to put me off -- they did the opposite , " she added			0
almost 230,000 men and boys across the world have since joined the @entity89 campaign , including @entity91 president @entity90 , and actors @entity92 and @entity94			2
" i read a letter of support from a 13 - year - old boy that was equally as passionate as a ceo , " said @entity0 , adding that she often read their stories before going to bed at night			1
" i asked my younger sister : ' what would be the one thing you 'd want from boys in your life ? ' she said : ' i just want them to play with us			0
' and i think that really translates at every level			0
we just want to be included			0
" @entity0 also talked about the inspiring influence of her mother , @entity114 , who was a " single working mother and type one diabetic			1
" " she wanted me to be my own person and said a bit of rebellion was good , " said @entity0 , adding : " she was actually thrilled when i got my first detention ... i think i failed a @entity122 exam			1
" answering questions submitted via @entity19 , @entity0 said the recent lack of female representation at the @entity126 showed that the fight for gender equality was far from over			1
" why are women not directing their own stories ? " she said			2
" the human race is a bird -- and it needs both its wings to fly			0
and at the moment one of its wings is clipped , " said @entity0 , paraphrasing famous @entity91 feminist , @entity134			1
when asked what things we can all do to affect change , the actress said it was n't necessarily about grand actions -- but small ones			2
" it 's everyday , it 's individual , it 's on a case by case basis , " she said			0
" whether it 's speaking up or trying to change the way someone else thinks about an issue			0
" in the audience , a man wearing a @entity156 jumper asked @entity0 whether women should be paid the same as men , when they are more likely to take maternity leave			1
she answered : " i do n't think in the grand scheme of things [ maternity leave ] is going to hinder a woman being incredibly effective in her field			0
" i think men should be equal partners in raising children			2
" those missing out on a place still got watch it live on @entity0 's facebook page			1
