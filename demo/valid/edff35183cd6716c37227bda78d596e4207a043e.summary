in 2007 i had my ovaries and fallopian tubes removed to prevent my getting ovarian cancer			1
it was a surgery of the kind that @entity5 recently underwent , as she revealed tuesday in a @entity9 op - ed. two years ago , @entity5 divulged that she 'd had a prophylactic double mastectomy -- i had done this as well , in 2012			1
along with the effects of the surgeries themselves , we now also share a related fallout : surgical menopause			1
this change can be big and , for me , happened almost immediately			2
there is little easing into it : the age - inappropriate night sweats , hot flashes , weight gain , mood swings			0
when i had my ovaries removed at age 37 , i suddenly felt less vibrant and beautiful , and instead experienced the slow creep of feeling old			1
what will this transition mean to someone like @entity5 , so identified for her attractiveness and glamour ? ( she may keep that part of her transformation private , but -- as with her disclosures about the surgeries -- it might do some good to discuss that , as well			1
) i 've been talking and writing about @entity37 since i learned more than 10 years ago that i carried this insidious , inherited genetic mutation			1
i 've discussed how these operations have affected my relationship with my husband and our two children			0
but often it takes someone as public , as gorgeous , as famous as ms. @entity5 to powerfully move the conversation about cancer prevention surgeries forward			1
her transparency helps normalize the experience of women considering their own options			0
it chips away at the stigma surrounding this treatment decision and offers women a new shorthand for explaining such a difficult choice to their families			0
when i underwent each of my surgeries a few friends looked at me sideways			2
they were n't familiar with @entity63 and or how surgery could statistically reduce my chances of developing cancer			2
now ms. @entity5 has changed this			1
her willingness to share such intimate experiences means more people will become educated and more brca survivors will feel free to speak of their scars			0
and there are many resources for brca - positive women			0
in june , i will be speaking at the annual force conference ( @entity77 ) , which has partnered with another wonderful organization , the @entity79 for @entity63 ( part of the @entity81 of the @entity82 )			0
both are leading the way in the scientific research and understanding of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers			0
they also provide resources around risk assessment , prevention , early detection , treatment , and survivorship , as well as links to chat rooms and local support groups			0
it 's not often a writer finds her circumstances so closely in sync with a @entity103 star			2
but i like to think ms. @entity5 and i , two women who truly have nothing in common , are linked in our determination to be proactive			1
we have looked fear in the face and made the only decisions that made sense for our families and our selves .			0

like @entity5 , @entity115 had two preventive cancer surgeries to remove her ovaries and fallopian tubes and later her breasts
@entity121 : @entity5 's disclosure about her surgeries has brought needed attention to this surgical option for carriers of insidious @entity37 gene
