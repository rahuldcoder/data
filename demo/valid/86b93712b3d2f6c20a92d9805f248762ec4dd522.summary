the cowardly and reprehensible shooting wednesday night of two police officers came in a tumultuous seven days for the @entity5 town , which had already seen @entity0 police chief @entity7 announce his resignation after a damning @entity10 report on its police department			1
the report , which was ordered in the wake of the killing of @entity14 last year , highlighted a predatory policing problem and a department that was biased , prejudiced and that has regularly targeted , arrested and fined african - americans			1
but what 's worse in all this is that @entity0 is illustrative of a broader problem across the country as increasingly militarized majority - white police departments demonstrate consistent racial bias toward majority - black communities			1
it 's a combustible mix. in three - quarters of all @entity31 cities with populations 50,000 or more , the police presence is " disproportionately white relative to the local population , " according to the @entity35			1
and tensions are being exacerbated by the use among police departments of military weapons , and stipulations that these former war zone weapons must be used within a year of acquisition			1
all this suggests a need for a completely new mindset on how we try to understand and implement policing practices across @entity31			1
indeed , a wholesale review of policies and approaches to law enforcement is needed , something that will likely necessitate drastic reforms in some departments so they can better represent , integrate , problem solve and liaise with the communities they are serving			0
first and foremost , our police departments must better reflect the diverse demographics of our increasingly diverse nation , whether it be race , creed , sexual orientation and more			1
@entity31 is changing fast , but police departments are n't keeping up			2
training and recruitment of minorities is critical , yet far more needs to be taking place			0
with this in mind , amplifying community policing models that work and scaling them up immediately is essential if we are to stem the growing and sometimes overwhelming tide of frustration , anger and cynicism welling up among young @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 @entity31			2
second , we must radically rethink the trend toward the indiscriminate procurement and use of surplus military grade weaponry , which under the @entity83 's 1033 program is flowing from battlefields to our local police forces			1
when the weapons of war come home from @entity90 and @entity91 to help police @entity31 's cities and towns , then you know something has gone terribly wrong with this country			2
mine - resistant ambush protected vehicles , tanks , drones , grenades and assault weapons should not replace the community policing of our @entity104			2
@entity0 is an excellent example of how the deployment of heavy weaponry inflames rather than de-escalates a crisis situation			1
having military equipment on our streets does not make citizens feel safer , which is why the @entity113 was recently reintroduced in @entity114			0
we do not need our officers looking like " @entity116 " when they patrol our streets			2
yet until such a bill is passed , war weapons will continue to flood our streets ; @entity114 must act to stem this tide			0
we understand that times have changed and that new security threats require new solutions and procedures			0
but it does n't justify the 150 raids per day by special weapons and tactics units for incidents that can be as benign as a @entity131 warrant			0
this kind of aggressive approach does n't engender the kind of engagement necessary for identifying real risks lurking in a community			0
in fact , the opposite happens			0
intelligence opportunities are dead on arrival , and potential allies who would otherwise be ready to help shut down immediately			0
aggressive military - type action is quickly turning @entity31 against fellow citizens who they are ostensibly there to serve and protect			0
we therefore trust that president @entity147 and attorney general @entity148 will take decisive action , working hand in hand with police departments all across this country			0
yes , the @entity155 's task force on police militarization was a start , but more concrete measures are needed if we want to reverse the rising anger in @entity0 and elsewhere			1
the time for a change is now			0
if we do n't press our police departments to reflect the makeup and needs of our communities , then towns like @entity0 will unravel further .			1
