@entity23 later saw @entity1 in the holding cell , and " he was dripping sweat ... like somebody threw a bucket of water on him , " @entity23 told the station			1
" and he wiped the sweat off his head and said , ' i have n't had my medication , ' and i said since when , and he said since yesterday			0
that 's when i went back in and told the judge ' you need to make an order that he gets his medicine and he has n't been fed ' and the judge said , ' well , they offered him food at some point today , ' and i said well that 's not what i 've heard , " @entity23 told the affiliate			0

he has collapsed before while in custody			0
