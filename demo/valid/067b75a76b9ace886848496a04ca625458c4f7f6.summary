hundreds of thousands of protesters gathered in cities across @entity3 this weekend , incensed by serious economic woes and a massive scandal involving the country 's oil company			1
the demonstrators have called for president @entity9 to be impeached			1
@entity0 correspondent @entity10 , who lives in @entity11 , explains who the demonstrators are , why they 're mad and what could be in store for the president and the country			1
what do the protesters want ? they 're angry about the country 's economy being in shambles at a time when political corruption at the highest levels of government is alleged			1
if it were just one of those things , maybe we would n't be seeing this kind of turnout because @entity3 have lived with corruption for decades and the economy was not doing well before the presidential election in october			1
but it 's all come to a head			1
political corruption -- let 's break that down			1
what 's the scandal about ? @entity43 is the national oil company			1
it 's one of the most powerful , richest companies in the country -- and has been counted among the largest in the world			1
@entity9 , who won election in october by a slim margin , was -- before becoming president -- the chairwoman of @entity43 ' board of directors			0
she was chairwoman during much of the time that former oil company executives have told investigators that bribes were paid to @entity59 executives and politicians in order to secure contracts from @entity43			1
in early march , the country 's highest court authorized the investigation which involves about 40 politicians , many of them from the president 's ruling @entity67 and the speakers of the @entity71 and @entity72			2
but @entity9 has n't been accused of anything , right ? right			0
she 's not being investigated			2
protesters ' call for impeachment -- the formal process of accusing , because she 's not been accused of anything -- looks very unlikely			1
but , the public perception is that even if she did n't personally profit for this scheme , she was still the chairwoman at a time when it was supposedly happening and she should be held accountable			0
has she responded to the protesters ? she has			2
what she says is that she will not stand for corruption and she 's rooting it out			2
as proof , she contends , she 's given her attorney general free rein to investigate who is stealing from the state oil company			1
it 's important to know that the @entity43 scandal has been known publicly for at least a year and during @entity9 's election campaign , she said over and over that she would root out corruption			1
it 's also interesting that she is n't lashing out at protesters			1
she is saying she wo n't put up with violence -- and so far the protests have n't gotten violent			0
but she says that @entity3 is a democratic country and people have the right to protest			0
she comes from a left - wing background so that approach is fitting			0
you brought up that she is from the left - wing @entity67			0
how is that significant ? the protests were mostly organized by the right - wing party that opposes @entity9 ... organized by people who did n't vote for her			0
there are n't people out today protesting			0
the next demonstrations are scheduled for april 12			0
i guess that goes to how organized these demonstrations really are -- setting an advance date like that			0
yes , well , that 's @entity3			2
it 's so the word can get out on social media			2
if she 's not accused of anything and the protests are politically motivated , will the protests affect her presidency ? @entity9 has four years ahead of her , it could end up being very hard for her govern			2
she won a little over half the vote in october and the people who did n't vote for her are still making their voices heard			0
and this @entity43 scandal is a problem			2
why was the election so close ? you have to bring it back to the economy			0
it had been slowing down , and traditionally the wealthier parts of the country like @entity11 have n't voted for @entity9 's party , the @entity67			1
the country is at 7.5 % inflation			0
the april 12 protest is ahead but three or four months down the road , what might happen ? the @entity72 and @entity71 speakers are @entity9 's allies and they are among those implicated in the @entity43 scheme			0
what if she is n't able to get badly needed legislation ? what will she do ? what will be party do ? these questions are hard to answer now			0
@entity0 's @entity155 in @entity156 talked with @entity0 's @entity157 who lives and reports in @entity3 .			1

@entity0 's @entity157 , who lives in @entity11 , explains who protesters are and what they want
demonstrators are angry about a massive scandal involving state oil company
protesters also are incensed about a *stumbling* economy
