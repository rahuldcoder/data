" a june 2011 email described a man trying to put his dogs on welfare because the canines were " mixed in color , unemployed , lazy , ca n't speak @entity44 and have no ... clue who their daddies are			0
" some critics have called for the department to be disbanded and for police chief @entity51 to resign			1

when asked about what happens next in @entity7 , @entity15 attorney general @entity61 said friday , " we are prepared to use all the power that we have , all the power that we have to ensure that the situation changes there			2
