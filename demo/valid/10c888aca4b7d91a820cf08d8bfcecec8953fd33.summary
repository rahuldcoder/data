what a difference a couple of years makes			0
a federal judge has struck down @entity5 's ban on same - sex marriage , calling it an " unabashedly gender - specific infringement of the equal rights of its citizens			1
" @entity13 district judge @entity12 's decision monday means that same - sex marriage is now against the law in fewer than one in four states			1
@entity5 state officials immediately appealed the ruling to the 8th @entity19			0
@entity12 denied a state request to stay his decision			0
and so , beginning monday the state must " treat same - sex couples the same as different sex couples " when it comes to marriage rights , the federal injunction reads			1
as the dominoes fall in favor of same - sex marriages , the question now seems to be which state will be the last ? the number of states offering same - sex marriages has surged since the @entity13 @entity37 's ruling in 2013 that invalidated part of the federal @entity39			1
states like @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 joined the fold voluntarily , while others -- most recently @entity5 and @entity47 -- were ordered by state or federal judges to offer and recognize the unions			2
the case involving @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 is expected to be decided sometime in june by the @entity13 @entity37			1
here 's the situation in the 12 states that currently ban same - sex marriages : the state 's constitutional ban on gay marriage , passed in 2004 , was struck down twice last year -- once by a state court judge and again by a @entity13 district court judge			1
local officials issued some 400 marriage licenses following the state court decision , but the state @entity37 blocked the issuance of more licenses pending its review of the case			2
a decision could come soon			0
@entity73 is one of just two states with no legislative action or pending legal decisions whatsoever on same - sex marriage			1
however , lawsuits are pending to overturn the state 's 2004 ban			0
the state 's ban is being challenged in state court , where a judge last year ruled the law is unconstitutional , and in federal court , where a @entity13 district court judge took the rare step , for a federal judge , of backing such a ban			2
the ban remains in place pending @entity97 's appeal of the state court ruling			0
on the federal level , a ruling is pending out of the @entity101 , which heard arguments in the case in january			0
last year , a @entity13 district court judge ruled that the state 's constitutional amendment banning gay marriages had no " legitimate purpose			2
" the @entity110 later overturned the ruling , reinstating gay marriage bans in @entity54 and four other states			2
the @entity54 ban is part of the @entity13 @entity37 case scheduled for arguments in april and a decision by june			1
a @entity13 district court judge ruled last year that the state 's same - sex marriage ban was unconstitutional , resulting in the issuance of more than 300 marriage licenses			1
that ended when the @entity110 granted a stay			0
the court later reinstated @entity53 's ban in the same ruling that reinstated @entity54 's ban			0
its fate will be decided by the @entity37 decision due by june			2
a state court judge ruled in november that @entity134 's 2004 constitutional ban on gay marriage was illegal			0
attorney general @entity136 appealed the ruling to the @entity138			0
but that court has indicated that it will not rule on the case until after the @entity13 @entity37 decision			1
just a few days after that state court ruling , a @entity13 district court judge struck down the state 's marriage ban , but that decision has been stayed pending appeals			2
while the state ban is in effect , officials in the @entity150 area have issued marriage licenses to same - sex couples			2
a @entity13 district court judge granted an injunction last year against the state 's same - sex marriage ban , describing it as unconstitutional			1
the judge , however , postponed his ruling from going into effect to give the state time to appeal			0
a federal appeals court heard arguments in the case in january			0
in the meantime , the same - sex marriage ban is still in effect			2
same - sex couples are challenging the state 's ban in @entity172 , but a federal judge issued a ruling on january 20 delaying the proceedings until after the @entity13 @entity37 rules			1
@entity13 @entity178 @entity177 struck down the state 's same - sex marriage ban in january , but blocked enforcement pending an appeal to the @entity182			1
the state 's ban was struck down in january 2014 by a federal judge who said it serves " no legitimate governmental purpose			0
" but , as in many other states , enforcement was delayed pending appeals			0
the @entity101 heard the case last month and a ruling is pending			0
a federal appeals court judge upheld a ban last year on same - sex marriages in the state			1
that decision is part of the @entity13 @entity37 case expected to be finalized this summer			1
in november 2014 , the @entity110 upheld the state 's ban			0
that decision also will be part of the @entity13 @entity37 case .			1

12 states do not allow same - sex marriages
the @entity13 @entity37 could settle the issue for good when it rules this year
