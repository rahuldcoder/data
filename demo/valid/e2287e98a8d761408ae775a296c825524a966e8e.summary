when it comes to the @entity3 fraternity and sorority system , it 's a disturbing truth : life is largely segregated by race , money and power ; and , yet , most of us find that unsurprising			1
this week , however , we got more evidence this callous status quo needs to change			2
the push came in the form of a nine - second @entity18 video , which i 'm sure you 've seen by now			0
it reportedly shows members of the @entity23 at the @entity24 chanting these chilling lines : " there will never be a ni * * * * @entity23			1
you can hang him from a tree , but he can never sign with me			0
" " the students on the bus clap and pump their fists as they boisterously chant , " @entity0 's @entity32 writes , describing a clip that rocketed around social media , leading @entity24 's president , @entity35 , to rightfully shutter and ban that fraternity from the school			1
the video is hard to watch , but i have a feeling it 's one we need to see , both because it hints at the inner workings of certain @entity47 organizations , and because it shows the persistent racism that still exists in the @entity3			1
i 'm thankful someone -- someone who was on the bus to witness the racist chants -- was brave enough to film this and to help it become public			0
that alone should give some reason for hope			0
others were n't , but i was shocked by the video			0
this , in 2015 ? in my home state ? both of my parents participated in @entity47 life in @entity64 , but at a different university			0
i know from their stories that these groups can be the basis for lifelong friendships and civic engagement			0
what happened on the bus at @entity24 does n't negate their positive experiences			1
but it should cause us to question a system that is inherently built around the concept of exclusion			1
sometimes students are excluded from @entity47 life , in theory , because they 're seen as uncool or do n't " fit in " with a particular chapter			0
but we 'd be kidding ourselves if we did n't realize that , often , a person 's race -- or sexual orientation , for that matter -- factors into this you 're - in , you 're - out process			1
@entity64 school 's response to video caught between racism , @entity95 and it 's hard for me not to see the @entity23 video as a manifestation -- an admittedly extreme one -- of this exclusionist ideology			1
this is a case of dangerous group - think run amok			0
in a system that remains largely divided by race , perhaps videos like this should n't be so surprising			1
that 's the view of @entity108 , an associate professor of sociology at the @entity110 who studies racial dynamics in @entity113 @entity47 life			1
the @entity3 fraternity and sorority system is " a form of @entity113 apartheid , " he told me in an interview on monday			1
instead of thinking of the @entity24 fraternity members as " bad apples , " he said , we should see them as part of a " bad orchard			1
" that orchard includes , but is n't limited to , @entity47 organizations , he told me			0
it also includes the rest of us and our country 's racist history			1
" largely , these organizations reflect a supersegregated and unequal system that is made up of college and alumni members all over the world , " he said			1
@entity23 is no stranger to scandal and sanctions comparative data on the racial make - up of these organizations is impossible to come by , but anecdotal evidence suggests these groups are starkly divided by race			1
from 2003 to 2006 , @entity108 spent time interviewing students from @entity47 organizations at three colleges on the @entity146			0
" at the time of interviews , the average membership size of the organizations was 63 members , and there was an average of 2.4 nonwhite members per organization , " he wrote in a 2010 paper published by @entity148			0
that 's 3.8 % minority members , in those instances			2
@entity108 's sample size is small but his results also echo what anyone who 's spent time on a college campus knows to be true : there are white fraternities and there are black ones			2
sometimes we even dare call them that			0
far too many of us , especially those of us with friends and family members who have participated in @entity47 life , either are in denial about this -- or we choose to see egregious cases of racism , sexism and violence in the @entity3 @entity47 system as somehow isolated			1
it 's clear that 's not the case			2
" in 1992 , @entity188 fined its chapter $ 1,000 after it threw a ' jungle party ' attended by frat brothers in blackface			0
then in 2002 , @entity193 suspended its chapter after one of its members went to a bar in blackface			0
as recently as 2013 , the fraternity got suspended following allegations it had photographed @entity113 students while pledges recited rap lyrics laced with racial slurs , " according to the @entity206 's @entity205			1
all of that was just @entity23			0
other examples are easy to come by , too			0
according to the @entity213 , here 's the text of an invitation to a 2013 @entity218 - themed @entity217 party at @entity219 : " we look forward to having @entity221 , @entity222 , you and @entity209 over for some sake			2
" and in january 2014 , according to the @entity224 , @entity223 investigated an @entity226 - day party hosted by the @entity228 fraternity in which " nonblack students mocked blacks by donning loose basketball jerseys , flashing gang signs and drinking from hollowed - out watermelons			2
" it 's clear there is a recurring problem here -- one that needs fixing			2
one easy place to start would be simply getting more information			0
why do n't universities force these organizations to report their demographics so we can see exactly how segregated this system really is ? @entity108 told me that data is n't available			2
then we could know the answers to some interesting questions : how segregated are @entity47 organizations ? are certain schools or organizations more integrated than others ? what 's the trend over time ? is there progress ? @entity258 on @entity24 students : ' they should be gone ' universities also should assess how and why they support these organizations			1
do traditionally black and @entity263 fraternities get as much school funding and attention as the white frats ? if not , why ? and why are these groups so incredibly divided in the first place ? what does that do to the student body as a whole ? i 'm not calling for an end to the @entity47 system			2
but it 's a system that needs to take a hard look in the mirror and make some real changes			1
" any time there are racist remarks made , we must speak up as @entity3 , " @entity35 , the @entity24 president , said in a news conference			1
he added that he hopes the @entity23 students " think long and hard " about the incident as they pack up and vacate their fraternity house early this week			2
" i hope they think long and hard about how words can injure and hurt other people , " he said			0
the rest of us should do that , too .			0
