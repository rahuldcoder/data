its a high stakes game of stick or twist with billions of dollars at stake			0
traditionally at this time of year , a clutch of nervous owners in charge of struggling clubs in @entity12 's top flight grapple with the prospect of relegation , and the enormous hole it threatens to blow in their finances			1
do they stick by a floundering manager hoping he can regroup and lead his team out of the mire , or do they get rid and hope the appointment of new coach can transform its fortunes ? on monday , @entity26 's @entity25 owner @entity24 elected to twist and fired the club 's @entity28 manager @entity27 , confirmed by a statement on its official website			1
less than a year ago @entity27 masterminded a miraculous run of form that saw the north east outfit triumph at @entity35 and @entity36 in order to stave off the threat of demotion			0
now that task is for someone else as @entity24 and @entity26 try to protect the cool $ 106m it pocketed last season , with one eye on the new television deal in 2016 that 's worth over $ 7.8 billion to the @entity48 's 20 clubs			1
" it 's inevitable @entity26 will have been thinking about money , " @entity49 , professor of sport business strategy and marketing at @entity51 , told @entity0			0
" particularly television money , because it now accounts for over 50 % of most , if not all , @entity48 clubs ' turnover			1
" it 'd be very easy to say they are thinking long term about money and long term about the next television contract but in reality , very often it is short term thinking			0
" whilst i 'm sure @entity26 are mindful of what 's going to happen in 2016 , they 'll be even more mindful of what 's going to happen in the summer of 2015 if they go down			2
" the tipping point came saturday when fellow strugglers @entity72 fired in four unanswered first - half goals against @entity26 , having scored four away goals in its previous 14 @entity48 matches			1
some fans streamed out of the @entity77 before halftime while one group tried to storm the home dugout to confront @entity27			2
it left @entity26 just one point away from the drop zone and was enough to convince billionaire @entity24 to swing the axe , the financial implications no doubt rattling round his mind			2
even though @entity90 , which finished bottom of the @entity48 last season , still banked $ 92.1m for its efforts , the disparity between tiers one and two in @entity12 is vast			1
" most obviously , the tv revenues from the @entity48 deal , " @entity49 answered when asked what @entity26 stands to lose if it does fall through the trapdoor			1
" also attendances tend to diminish rapidly so your two biggest sources of revenue are almost instantaneously undermined			0
" i would n't want to put a figure on it but you 're talking tens of millions heading up towards potentially hundreds of millions			0
" ironically , @entity72 were marshaled to victory on saturday by its new manager @entity106 , installed in the wake of @entity109 's sacking in february			2
@entity72 's @entity25 owner @entity110 , who is in the process of trying to sell the club , decided to act after a miserable run of form that saw them score just 12 goals in its opening 25 @entity48 matches			1
after saturday 's win , the @entity119 club is now three points clear of the relegation places and @entity24 will be hoping for a similar bounce when he appoints a new man			1
according to @entity49 , research shows a change of manager at this late stage of the campaign can provide all - important impetus , but he argues there are few " impact managers " available at present			0
and he suggests the approach of @entity24 and @entity110 proves @entity25 owners still do n't fully understand the dynamic of @entity12 football as well as they perhaps should			1
" it 's easy to succumb to fan pressure and results but there 's a particular culture in football generally -- obviously inside clubs as well -- and i 'm not sure @entity25 owners are in tune with that , " he said			2
" we 've seen it with @entity72 -- this is probably a prime example of an owner that many people speak highly of even now but i do n't think they understand local communities or the somewhat parochial nature sometimes of @entity12 football still			1
" so they are making decisions that are not entirely culturally consistent with their experiences and the experiences of @entity12 football clubs			0
" @entity49 also says the bumper television revenue afforded to clubs in modern football has created a tiered @entity48 in which few teams outside the established giants can realistically expect to compete at the top end			1
" in one sense , it 's always been like this , " he said			0
" you go back to the 1980s when @entity170 were dominant -- some teams knew they were n't going to be champions			0
" i think the television revenues have cemented that position of the dominant teams			0
" whilst the @entity48 would argue it 's a progressive system in the sense that the collective deal does allocate finances to clubs that perhaps those in @entity182 do n't have , even so , such is the magnitude of the payments made to the achieving clubs its almost inevitable you will get the likes of @entity36 , @entity188 and the rest dominating			2
" for the likes of the north east clubs @entity26 , @entity193 and @entity194 it is great if they can get there , even better if they can stay there			0

@entity48 club @entity26 sack @entity28 manager @entity27
heavy home *defeat* to @entity72 on saturday final straw for @entity25 owner @entity24
relegation from @entity12 top flight could cost clubs hundreds of millions of dollars
