early thursday -- during the ongoing protests that continue to shake @entity2 , @entity3 -- two police officers were shot			1
such violence and lawlessness should never be tolerated			2
but the unrest during which it occurred demonstrates that the people of @entity2 have lost all confidence in their police department			1
and the resignation of the police chief this week wo n't be enough to restore faith in law and order			1
everyone in the department needs to step down so the department can be rebuilt from the ground up			2
it is easy to see why			2
after a police officer shot @entity25 , the @entity23 @entity22 conducted an investigation into the @entity27			1
what investigators found was a " pattern and practice " of discrimination against african - americans			2
in a town with a black population of 67 % , black people represented 85 % of vehicle searches , 90 % of the traffic violations and 93 % of the arrests			0
there is no way to justify this			0
now , the @entity22 has an opportunity to gut the @entity27 and rebuild it from scratch			1
in fact , it 's more than an opportunity : it 's a necessity			0
in the court of law , there is an old closing argument that goes like this : you sit down , pour yourself a bowl of stew and find that the first piece of meat that you taste is rancid			0
you do n't put just that piece aside ; you throw out the whole bowl			0
lawyers use this story to say that if you catch a witness lying about one thing , then you ca n't believe anything they say			0
unfortunately , it is an analogy that can be applied to the @entity27			0
the @entity22 report revealing unquestionable racist bias that permeated the entire department can not be ignored , and the problems it reveals can not be fixed from the inside			1
if there are a few good cops in the @entity27 , they need to leave , and they need to go elsewhere to continue their proud law enforcement career without being overshadowed by their involvement in a poisoned organization			0
in fact , everyone in the @entity27 needs to leave , from the top to the bottom			0
the police department should be completely reconstituted under @entity22 control in a manner that ensures that citizens of @entity2 receive the type of public service they pay for and deserve -- and more importantly , in a manner that protects their rights , not only as citizens of @entity2 , @entity3 , but as constitutionally protected citizens of our country			1
a completely rebuilt @entity27 , established with a charter to enforce the law with equality , could serve as an example for every law enforcement agency in the country			0
a new @entity27 could show what a concerted , roots - up effort toward nonracist behavior in a police department can be			1
under @entity22 leadership , the @entity27 could become a model for practices such as equipping all police with body cameras , community policing and better use of force training			1
if we can create from the ashes of the @entity27 a model that works , it may provide some consolation for minorities who have been disproportionately targeted by law enforcement			2
and if the black community in @entity2 -- in fact , people of every race in @entity2 -- can look back five years from now and see an unbiased organization of public servants who give respect and get respect , who reduce fear rather than cause it , then perhaps the tragedy of @entity25 's death will stand for something .			1

@entity135 : @entity22 says @entity2 has record of racial discrimination
@entity135 says police force in @entity2 must be *dismantled*
he says a new department , with new practices to *prevent* replay of abuses , can be model for others , help repair *injustices* in @entity2
