the country 's largest @entity2 denomination has changed its definition of marriage to include gay couples -- though not explicitly			1
@entity9 ( @entity8 ) approved an amendment to its constitution after most of its 171 presbyteries -- or governing bodies -- voted for it , @entity7 ( @entity8 ) said tuesday			1
before , the definition said marriage was between " a man and a woman			2
" the new definition says , in part , that " marriage involves a unique commitment between two people , traditionally a man and a woman , to love and support each other for the rest of their lives			1
" already , @entity7 ( @entity8 ) ministers can perform same - sex marriages in states where such marriages are legal , the group said			1
but no teaching elder or session can be forced to conduct same - sex marriage ceremonies if they do not believe they are appropriate			2
not all members supported the decision			2
in a post on @entity7 ( @entity8 ) 's website , @entity39 and @entity40 accused the church of going against the @entity44 and threatened to leave			1
" we are not to change the @entity44 , " their post said			0
" i do n't care who disagrees			0
" but the @entity50 of @entity51 , which says it supports " a fully inclusive church , " welcomed the news tuesday night			0
" the change aligns the church 's constitution with a reality that has long been true : both same - gender and opposite - gender couples have been living in relationships that demonstrate covenant faithfulness , shared discipleship and mutual love , " the group said			0
" we are also aware that the discussion has been a difficult one for many , and that some will feel a deep sense of pain over this decision			0
the @entity50 is committed to fostering healthy dialogue and working with those who hold a view different from ours , seeking opportunities for us to model an authentic and productive unity			0
" the amendment will take effect on june 21			1
