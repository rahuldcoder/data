the estimated number of people killed in eastern @entity4 since april 2014 now exceeds 6,000 " in spite of successive ceasefires , " the @entity0 announced in a statement on monday			1
the escalation in fighting in recent weeks , particularly near @entity11 airport and in the @entity13 area , resulted in hundreds of deaths , both civilian and military , according to a new report			1
the report paints a picture of " merciless devastation of civilian lives and infrastructure , " said @entity21			2
he called for all sides to adhere to the @entity24 agreement , which calls for a ceasefire in many of the conflict 's hotspots			0
the fighting has inflicted extreme humanitarian hardship on civilians			1
" many have been trapped in conflict zones , forced to shelter in basements , with hardly any drinking water , food , heating , electricity or basic medical supplies , " @entity32 said in a statement			0
the notion that civilians remained in the conflict zone of their own will is " misguided , " he said			2
" many people stay because they fear for their lives if they try to move			1
many others stay to protect children , other family members , or their property			0
and some are forced to stay against their will , or are simply physically unable to leave , " @entity32 said			0
a series of terror attacks in @entity56 , as well as in @entity57 and @entity58 , which are outside of the conflict zone , have set a bad precedent , he said			0
" should this trend continue , this would represent a new and very deadly chapter in this conflict , expanding the areas where the rule of law and the protection of human rights are effectively absent , " @entity32 said			0
the @entity0 arrived at the new estimated death toll of over 6,000 by tallying 5,809 documented deaths and assessing that many more must have been killed in recent fighting in other areas , particularly @entity11 airport and around @entity13 .			1

fighting in recent weeks at @entity74 and in @entity75 has killed hundreds , @entity0 says
civilians who have **n't** left often do **n't** for fear of being killed , if they try to move
