if the 20th century was the century of the skyscraper , then the 21st century is shaping up as the century of the " plyscaper			1
" despite its historical reputation for great city fires -- @entity8 in 1666 , the @entity6 of 1871 and @entity7 in 1906 -- wood is making a comeback as a construction material			1
next year in @entity12 , construction will begin on a 275 - foot building made almost entirely of wood , while @entity15 may build a 34 - story wooden apartment by 2023			1
others are in the pipeline from @entity20 to @entity21 to @entity22			2
with faster construction times and a softer environmental impact , could the building material of the past be the future of construction ? @entity29 - based architect @entity28 says the momentum is gaining as new engineered woods allow for greater strength and heights in buildings			1
his firm @entity35 recently completed a 29.5m ( 97 feet ) wooden building , the @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity40 @entity39			2
but he said news of taller wooden structures is sprouting up all the time			2
" there seems to be a new announcement every two or three weeks , " @entity28 said			2
" we 've got one in @entity29 for 18 stories and in @entity12 there 's one for more than 20 stories			2
" we 've done research in high earthquake zones that show 30 stories is feasible ; we certainly think we can go to 40 and higher			2
" he said new developments in engineered woods -- small wood components that are glued together to make large panels for building -- are a game - changer for construction			1
@entity62 timber panels , in particular , cross-laminated timber ( known in the industry simply as @entity65 ) are becoming established as a quicker , greener and eventually cheaper alternative to concrete and steel			2
one great bonus of the material is the speed of construction ; panels can be made to measure in the factory complete with openings , windows and doors			1
while the main advantages of working in wood are manifold -- it 's flexible , robust and easily worked -- @entity28 says wood may be the only material to address the growing problems of urbanization			1
" @entity84 has not been an urban material so we looked at how it could be a contributor to urban environments , " he said			1
" there are a whole host of advantages			2
" steel and concrete have huge carbon footprints			2
concrete accounts for about 6 - 8 % of man 's greenhouse gas emissions , whereas wood stores carbon dioxide and gives us a vehicle to create carbon - neutral buildings			1
" the energy used to harvest wood , he said , is much less than the enormous amount required to produce concrete and steel			0
" there is no other building material that is grown by the @entity112 , " he said			1
" we 've calculated that the @entity114 forests grow enough wood for a 20 - story wood building every 8 - 10 minutes			0
" ultimately , building in wood , @entity28 argues , creates an economic incentive to plant more forests			0
" the climate story is really happening at both ends of the argument -- by using more wood we encourage countries around the world to plant more trees			0
" about 20 % of man 's carbon footprint comes from deforestation , this creates an important incentive for reforestation , " he said			0
in terms of carbon footprint , a 20 - story plyscraper put against its counterpart in concrete and steel is the equivalent of taking 900 cars off the road for a year , @entity35 estimates			0
but the established nature of concrete and steel means that @entity65 will not replace urban building materials overnight			0
concerns over fire and inherent problems with its acoustic qualities ( apartments need additional acoustic measures to keep noise from traveling ) have meant that the construction establishment has been slow to come to the party			1
in @entity12 , for example , the @entity156 fire services are working with architects to test their plans			0
" the main factor is that everyone wants to build higher and higher buildings			1
an 84 - meter - high building in @entity22 is not usual and there are a lot of necessities that have to be realized , " fire service spokesman @entity163 told @entity165 newspaper			0
" a few of us were upset because it was crazy to present an idea like this that has not been discussed with everyone yet			0
" they have to carry out special tests on the correct combination of concrete and wood			0
we also want to develop a more fail - safe sprinkler system			0
i expect they will pass the tests but if they develop the building as they say they will , it will be a serious project			0
" @entity28 counters that @entity65 is as fire resistant as other new - builds made by traditional means and likens its ability to burn to trying to set a redwood on fire with a lit match , with any charring creating an insulation layer that protects the wood underneath			0
even so , the industry remains largely skeptical of a process that -- while having obvious advantages in terms of speed -- is still on par with steel and concrete construction in terms of cost			1
" it will become cheaper but it 's too new to be significantly less expensive , " @entity28 said , adding that the difficulty lies in competing with a well - honed and century - old system of designing , building and budgeting for concrete and steel			0
" the culture of building and the culture of developing buildings is very conservative , " he said			1
" the hardest part of my job is not the engineering and the design or the innovation , it 's really about changing the public 's perception of what 's possible			0
" ultimately , buildings of the future are likely to be a mixture of wooden components and concrete and steel ; combining the stability of concrete with the flexibility and speed of wood			1
leading timber specialist at the engineering group @entity239 , @entity240 , said that shear walls -- the core of tall buildings which provide stability against the lateral force of the wind or seismic activity -- are likely to continue to be made from concrete and steel			1
however , the real savings from wood come when all the cost elements of making a tall building are taken into account			1
" clients are missing a trick with wood , " he said , adding that dollar - for - dollar as a pure construction material wood can still struggle to be cheaper than concrete			1
" what you need to do if you want an economic wood solution is to think about all the aspects from outset			0
" you will save on the program because it 's all dry and is quick to erect and potentially , if you 're making an office building , you can leave a lot of the wood exposed , saving on the cost and time of installing finishes			1
" apart from having a sustainable solution , @entity240 says , clients will gain a building that looks good too			0
" if you leave the wood exposed , you can have a really nice environment inside the building , " he says			0
" there are studies that show that people are happier inside wood structures			0
