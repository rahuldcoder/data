@entity0 on the southern edge of @entity3 is best known for its shoreline trails offering a scenic reprieve from campus life			0
freshman @entity7 sees it in a different light after learning about @entity10 , the influential 20th century @entity11 writer and activist who attended the @entity14 single - sex college in the 1920s			1
in one of @entity10 's poems , she describes the tranquil waters of @entity0 as her only source of comfort in bouts of homesickness			2
now , @entity0 provides @entity23 with a tangible connection to a woman from another time , someone who rose to prominence after walking the same grounds as her			0
and , not just any woman , but someone who shares @entity23 's cultural roots			2
" knowing that someone lived in the exact spot where you are right now , and knowing that so much came out of her life inspires you to think that you can accomplish just as much , " she said			0
it 's a big deal for @entity23 , who says she never learned about a single @entity39 in school			2
as far as she knew growing in @entity43 , the white men featured in public monuments were the only people who made noteworthy contributions to history			2
she knows better now thanks to her involvement with activist group @entity49 , which is putting women on the map , with a little help from @entity53			1
@entity23 and a group of girls around the world spent the past five months researching locations of significance in the lives of women who do n't always get a mention in history class			1
starting this week , their stories will be featured on @entity53 's field trip app tagged to significant locations in their lives			1
for @entity10 , it 's @entity69			2
for dancer @entity71 , it 's @entity73 's @entity72 , where she became the first @entity76 - @entity75 prima ballerina			2
for 19th century journalist @entity78 , it 's @entity79 , @entity80 , the village at the base of @entity83 , which she scaled in 1908 in a record - setting feat. for journalist @entity87 , it 's the site of women 's @entity88 on @entity90 , now @entity90 island in @entity73 , where she went undercover for a story			1
most of the women have @entity96 pages or obits online ; far fewer have parks , squares or monuments named for them			2
" every single one of these woman is a rock star , " @entity23 said			0
" these women have been edited from history not because they did n't make meaningful contributions to society but because someone deemed their stories not worthy of being told			1
" the initiative started in 2013 when @entity49 approached @entity53 with data showing that women and people of color were underrepresented in the popular doodles featured on its search homepage			1
the @entity118 team has since made strides toward balance the ratio			0
the encounter led to talks about another @entity49 project on representation of women and people of color in parks , monuments and public spaces -- " all the places outside a school textbook where we learn about who 's important in the world , " @entity49 executive director @entity122 said			1
the conversations led to @entity53 's @entity137 , creator of @entity139			1
the app displays geotagged stories within a certain geographic radius created by different publishers			1
users can choose to be alerted to locations in a certain category			0
@entity53 agreed to publish the stories if @entity49 created them			1
after all , @entity49 's vision fit into @entity139 's goal to help people " discover the stories around them , " said @entity53 's @entity153 , who worked with @entity49			1
" it 's one thing to read about a landmark while sitting on your couch , " she said			2
visiting it in person creates a sensory experience that 's harder to forget , and telling a story about the place has the potential to create an even stronger connection , she said			0
" we 're hoping it brings more awareness to those locations and stories , " she said			0
" what i really hope is that people learn something cool about a place and a woman , and feel inspired to do something similar in their community			0
" the initiative launched on monday featuring 119 women in 28 countries representing the arts , science and technology			0
the hard part was not finding women , 15 - year - old @entity49 member @entity183 said			1
pinpointing locations to feature was the greater challenge , sometimes because of lack of information ; in other cases , it was hard to choose just one			0
take for example , @entity195 , who disguised herself as a man so she could fight in the @entity197			0
the coordinates of her birthplace will show up for anyone using the app in the vicinity of @entity203 , @entity14			0
the app also features @entity204 , a 19th century @entity206 self - educated fossil hunter who was unable to publish her discoveries in her lifetime			0
the app highlights the @entity206 shore where she made some of her most significant findings , including the first complete skeleton of a long - necked @entity214			0
@entity183 , a student at @entity215 in @entity216 , knows firsthand that women 's contributions to science , technology , engineering and math do n't usually make it into the lesson plan			1
through this project and other @entity49 initiatives , she hopes to change that			1
" it 's time we recognized the female scientists , researchers , musicians who are invisible to us , " she said			1
" they definitely existed , we just do n't learn about them			0

teen activist group @entity49 researches history 's " invisible " women
stories of women will be shared on @entity53 's @entity139 app
