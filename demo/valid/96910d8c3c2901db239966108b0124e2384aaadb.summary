in it , fraternity members from your university are chanting a hateful , racist song about lynching african - americans			1
you 're president of the university			1
imagine being in that situation			1
what would you do ? there are two ways to answer the question			2
the first is in the moment of crisis			2
the second is about the long term			2
as most everyone knows by now , @entity20 , president of the @entity21 , faced just this situation monday			1
and i 've been thinking about it intensely , not only because i care about race and civic leadership in @entity28 , but also because @entity20 was my first boss , when he was a @entity28 senator			1
i 'm not from @entity29 but ended up working for @entity20 through a college internship			1
he was a mentor to me during my years in @entity32 , and a model for me when he left the @entity34 to be of greater use and service as an educator			2
though we have n't talked since the crisis broke , i see familiar patterns of leadership			2
@entity20 responded to the crisis swiftly , with a statement that went viral			1
@entity20 told the students from @entity45 ( @entity45 ) he had a message for them : " you are disgraceful			1
you have violated all that we stand for			2
you should not have the privilege of calling yourselves @entity50 " ( the @entity21 nickname )			1
@entity20 went on to sever all ties between @entity21 and @entity45			1
the national fraternity closed the local chapter			2
later , @entity20 said he 'd be glad if the students in the video left campus because " we do n't provide student services for bigots			1
" the next day he expelled two of them			2
his actions have resonated across the country			2
on social media , people shocked by the video find themselves also stunned by @entity20 's response			1
why ? because he did something rare in public life today			1
he expressed a decisive , judgmental view with moral clarity			1
his statements have been free of mushy lawyer - talk or euphemism			2
he 's led authentically , from the heart			2
of course , people have carped			0
some question whether @entity20 has the legal authority , as head of a public institution , to expel students on the basis of their free speech , even racist hate speech			1
some lament that what he should have branded as disgraceful was the students ' actions , not the students themselves			0
the @entity94 question , certainly , is being debated by legal scholars			0
but these concerns are eclipsed by the bigger picture			0
@entity20 was n't just condemning wrongdoers ; he was shifting social norms for all			1
a cynic might consider laughable a refrain from @entity20 's statement about " real @entity50			1
" @entity20 said that real @entity50 are not racists or bigots ; they believe in equal opportunity , treat people with mutual respect and love each other like family			1
a cynic might say @entity29 is a state both very white and very red , not known for flying the banner of anti-racism			0
indeed , the original @entity50 were the white settlers who raced in to claim land that had been wrested from @entity116			0
but the point of @entity20 's " real @entity50 " riff is not to describe or sanitize today 's reality ; it is to issue a challenge			1
it is to bind people to a creed , a standard of being and belief that is easy to assert but hard to achieve			0
not unlike being a true patriot			0
so now begins the longer term			0
here , another opportunity arises to lead by example			0
@entity20 can now examine the institution he works for and ask how and why such attitudes and behaviors -- racism so casually vicious -- could ever take root among people as young as freshmen			1
he can explore the ways in which everyone -- not only the obviously guilty parties at a frat party -- is touched by unconscious bias and institutional racism			1
he can now ask his community to face the inequities of history and race			0
we can all do that			0
@entity150 , ceo of @entity151 , is doing this at his company			0
he was moved after the incidents of @entity155 and @entity156 to hold truly open forums with employees about the pain and anguish of racial division			0
but you do n't have to be a college president or a ceo			1
you do n't have to be a white man in charge to start a tough reckoning with racism ( though it 'd help if more did )			0
whoever you are , you can start a new kind of conversation in your neighborhood			0
at your house of worship			0
ask what the history is			0
ask why there are such imbalances of power and voice			0
ask what it would take to be truly inclusive			0
then , in word and deed , start answering your own questions			0
we can all do that			0
the sooner , the better .			0
