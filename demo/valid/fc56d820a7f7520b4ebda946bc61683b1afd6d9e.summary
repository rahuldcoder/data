six weeks into the murder trial of former @entity6 star @entity5 , jurors in @entity1 , @entity2 , are getting more pieces of a time line leading up to the 2013 shooting death of @entity10 , a semi-pro football player who was dating the sister of @entity5 's fiancée			1
taking center stage this week -- videotape never before seen in public , taken from @entity5 's own home security system			1
prosecutors are using that grainy footage to suggest @entity5 is holding a .45 - caliber handgun -- the same kind police say was used to kill @entity10			1
@entity5 is seen on camera pulling into his driveway minutes after @entity10 was shot to death in an industrial park about a mile from @entity5 ' @entity26 home			1
" in my opinion , the firearm shown in the video stills is a glock pistol , " @entity28 sales manager @entity27 testifies			0
@entity5 , @entity33 , and @entity34 are seen on the same security video , recorded at about 3:30 a.m. on june 17 , 2013 , after the men walk into @entity5 's home			1
all three have been charged with murder in the death of @entity10 and have pleaded not guilty			2
@entity33 and @entity34 are being tried separately			0
the video is time - stamped minutes after workers in a nearby industrial park describe hearing loud noises like fireworks -- the moment prosecutors say @entity10 was gunned down after getting out of a car driven by @entity5			1
jurors lean forward in their chairs , peering into monitors and scribbling notes as @entity52 , a former @entity2 state trooper and @entity55 police chief , takes them frame by frame through video during two days of testimony			2
@entity27 tells jurors @entity5 appears to be holding the pistol by its muzzle as he 's standing at his basement door			1
the defense will have none of it			0
they attack @entity52 's credentials			0
@entity52 is well - schooled in glocks but admits he does n't consider himself a gun identification expert			0
@entity5 's lawyers then show a different part of the video time - stamped a few seconds earlier with @entity5 holding what appears to be a shiny object in one hand , suggesting it may be an @entity78			1
" glock pistols do n't have white glows to them , do they ? " defense attorney @entity79 asks			0
" no , they do not , " @entity27 answers			0
@entity79 then displays a soft - pellet gun similar in shape to a @entity28 , suggesting it could also be the object @entity5 is holding			1
" are you aware of anybody going pellet gun shooting at 3:30 in the morning ? " @entity93 assistant district attorney @entity92 asks @entity52			0
@entity95 law professor @entity94 calls the @entity28 expert 's findings powerful ; yet , he thinks the defense did a solid job of raising questions about the fuzzy video			2
" the jury might think that the defense is just throwing things against the wall , " he says			0
" but on the other hand , the jury may feel like it could be one of a dozen things			0
" one thing not in dispute : the alleged murder weapon remains missing			0
so does a solid motive			0
prosecutors could be laying the groundwork for showing more surveillance video of @entity5 -- who at the time was a star receiver for the @entity121 -- partying with @entity10 and @entity5 's personal barber at @entity124 nightclub two nights before @entity10 's death			1
investigators say @entity5 was angry that @entity10 was talking to some people that night			1
@entity5 and @entity10 are not seen together on a camera pointed at the club 's bar , and they appear to be separated for a time when they leave , but so far there 's no testimony about what may have gone wrong			1
what might @entity5 's fiancée say ? @entity139 , a longtime friend of @entity10 's who takes the stand , tells jurors he talked with @entity10 at the club and says he appeared " normal			1
" when @entity143 leaves the stand , he keeps his eyes locked on @entity5 until he walks past the defense table			2
cameras show @entity5 leaving the bar , but they do not show the moment when a parking valet testified he saw what he believed to be a gun in @entity5 's waistband			1
the valet 's hotel security boss tells jurors he did n't see a weapon under the football player 's shirt			2
near the club , @entity5 is in his suv with @entity10 and another friend			2
@entity5 offers a ride to @entity164 , his babysitter , who happened to be nearby with a friend			2
@entity164 tells jurors @entity5 and @entity10 were smoking pot. despite her objections , @entity5 drives her and the friend to @entity5 's so - called " flophouse " about 20 minutes from @entity171 , the @entity121 ' home field in @entity173			1
@entity164 testifies that @entity5 " tried kissing me			0
" " i told him ' no , i 'm your nanny			0
i ca n't do this , ' " she adds			0
" he said he understood ... and he was n't mad at me			0
