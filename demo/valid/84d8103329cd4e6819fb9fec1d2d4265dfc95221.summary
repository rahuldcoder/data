i was deeply moved watching @entity2 win the @entity3 for " @entity4 , " a movie i was proud and privileged to be an executive producer on			0
@entity2 gives a harrowing performance as a brilliant 50 - year - old college professor who loses her brain and herself to early - onset alzheimer 's disease			0
this is a huge moment for @entity2 -- and a huge moment for all of us who have been trying to focus public attention on this staggering disease			0
witnessing @entity18 's progress on the big screen is as terrifying as it is in real life			1
i know , because i 'm a child of @entity18 's			1
the mind of my father , @entity23 , had always been a finely tuned instrument that left people in awe and inspired			0
but my family and i watched @entity18 's erase that brain -- slowly , inexorably , completely			1
it was terrifying , too , because back then , the disease was surrounded by shame and silence			0
@entity18 's still carries a stigma of the unknown -- even though today more than 5 million @entity35 have it			1
every 67 seconds , another one of us develops @entity18 's			1
women in their 60s are about twice as likely to develop @entity18 's as breast cancer			1
with 10,000 baby boomers turning 65 every day , there will be 13.5 million of us with @entity18 's by 2050			1
and many people do n't understand that @entity18 's is n't a natural part of aging			1
@entity18 's is a disease that kills			1
the truth is , we 're right in the middle of an epidemic , but we as a nation are in denial			0
an @entity3 for " @entity4 " is shining the brightest light yet on @entity18 's , but light is n't enough anymore			1
it 's time to get serious			0
@entity18 's is exerting a powerful impact on @entity35 families -- on our health , our finances , and our futures			1
and women are disproportionately affected			2
why women ? back in 2010 , when we published " the @entity66 : a woman 's nation takes on @entity18 , " we reported that women were more than half the individuals diagnosed with @entity18 's and nearly two - thirds of the unpaid caregivers of those who had it			1
now those numbers are far worse			0
today nearly two - thirds of those with @entity18 's are women -- that 's more than 3.2 million women			1
and more than 60 % of caregivers for people with @entity18 's and dementia are women , with many having to reduce their own workload or even drop out of the workforce altogether to care for loved ones			1
opinion : why ' @entity4 ' is about you women are the epicenter of this crisis , which is why i believe they also have to be the solution			0
so , in partnership with the @entity95 and so many inspiring women already working on the front lines to fight this disease , we have launched the @entity99 , a multipronged campaign powered by women 's brains			2
our mission is to enlist women of all ages to get educated , engaged and empowered to instigate change			0
women around the country will go out and raise the alarm , raise awareness , raise the stakes and raise millions of dollars to fund serious research into women 's brains			2
and there 's so much research to do and so many questions to answer			0
why is the incidence of @entity18 's higher for women ? nobody knows			1
and why is it that women in their 60s are so much more likely to get @entity18 's than breast cancer ? nobody knows			1
what 's the exact role of estrogen ? we do n't know			0
is there an @entity18 's connection with depression or with diabetes ? what about genetics ? what can be done during the 20 or so years when the disease develops , before a woman even becomes symptomatic ? what 's the impact of diet , stress level , exercise , sleep and cardiovascular condition ? it 's time to find out			2
we have to fund this research , because for some reason it 's not a priority for the government			2
in 2015 , @entity153 will spend an estimated $ 6 billion on cancer research and $ 3 billion on hiv / aids research , but only $ 586 million on @entity18 's			2
yet , as the @entity95 tells us , " the costs to all payers for the care of people living with alzheimer 's disease and other dementias will total an estimated $ 226 billion , with @entity162 and @entity163 paying 68 percent of the costs			0
" i do n't get it , but i 'm not going to wait anymore			0
so wipe out @entity18 's is stepping in			1
we 're asking women to put together their own " brain trusts " in their communities -- groups that will go out and do some muscular fund - raising			0
but equally important , these brain trusts will gather to discuss and disseminate information about what the disease is and is n't			0
what are the warning signs we should look for in ourselves and our parents ? what 's the difference between normal forgetfulness , dementia and alzheimer 's disease ? can brain games or meditation slow cognitive decline ? do dietary supplements help ? local brain trust groups will also learn about the devastatingly high cost of @entity18 's -- how neither @entity162 nor the @entity190 covers long - term care , and the cost of a semiprivate nursing home room averages more than $ 80,000 a year			2
they 'll reach out to help and encourage women whose loved ones have @entity18 's			1
they will be politically engaged and encourage political candidates who support increased funding for @entity18 's research			1
they 'll push their own doctors to get better - educated about cognitive health			0
it 's time for the narrative around @entity18 's to change			2
i remember when an hiv / aids diagnosis was a death sentence			0
i remember when cancer was a dirty word , and the prognosis was always grim			0
but @entity212 and cancer activists are helping to take these diseases from terrifying to treatable , from hopeless to hopeful			0
we want to do the same with @entity18 's			2
we want to understand it , prevent it , treat it and beat it			0
wipe out @entity18 's is creating a global community of women activists , agitators and agents of change to do just that			1
we used to think that the mysterious condition called @entity18 happened only to folks in their 80s and 90s			2
" @entity4 " shows us that 's just not true			0
the race for the @entity3 may be over , but the race to wipe out @entity18 's is on .			1

@entity234 's father was *stricken* by @entity18 's , a growing *scourge* in @entity35
women are disproportionately affected as *sufferers* and caregivers , she says
wipe out @entity241 is launching to fill in for *lagging* government funding , she says
