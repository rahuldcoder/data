today , @entity0 might be meeting with @entity3 executives or maybe giving a talk at the @entity5 about girls ' education , poverty or @entity9			1
but just a few months ago , she was on the front lines fighting the @entity9 epidemic in @entity12			1
" i think anybody that has any feelings for the countries in @entity17 that were hit was feeling helpless , " @entity0 said			2
@entity0 had spent the last nine years of her life in @entity12 setting up the @entity19 , a tuition - free school for at - risk @entity12 girls			1
while she was on summer break last year , visiting her family in the @entity26 , her mind kept going back to @entity12 and the @entity9 outbreak			1
she could n't sit idle as her neighbors , friends and students were fighting for their lives			0
@entity0 , who is not a medical professional , flew back to the front lines of a global epidemic , the last place most @entity26 wanted to be during the outbreak			2
back in @entity12 , @entity0 quickly realized that fighting @entity9 would be more complicated than administering medical care			1
with dozens of aid organizations descending on the country , few of them had a history or relationship with it			0
@entity0 saw an opportunity to leverage her relationship with the community of @entity46 , the slum in which her school is located			1
her ability to speak the @entity12 - @entity51 dialect facilitated logistics			2
" the people knew what was needed , " @entity0 said			2
" they knew what to do			0
they just did n't have the resources			0
" her organization met with community leaders and they decided more ambulances were needed			0
in some instances , it took up to four days for an ambulance to show up			0
@entity0 was able to bring in four ambulances and coordinate with the fathers of her students , who responded to calls by driving the ambulances			2
@entity0 and community leaders identified what was most needed and then came up with steps to meet those needs , said @entity0			1
next , they formed a group of active case finders , people who would go door to door in the poorest parts of @entity46 , looking for anyone that had fallen ill. once a sick person was identified , a nursing team was dispatched to determine the next steps and treatment			0
the hardest part for @entity0 , who often describes herself as a " big kid , " was seeing children abandoned and orphaned by @entity9			1
according to @entity89 , 16,600 children have lost one or both parents to @entity9 in @entity91 , @entity12 and @entity92			1
@entity0 's school turned one of its guesthouses into @entity96 , a place to quarantine children suspected of having the ebola virus			2
during the good times and the bad , @entity0 took to @entity102 to post photos and her thoughts			2
for nearly 100,000 of her followers , her @entity102 became a window into the battle against @entity9			0
social media have played a major role in the success of @entity0 's organization since its inception nine years ago			0
to launch more than me , she did everything from fund - raising on @entity114 to participating in clinical research studies			0
in 2012 , the group was awarded a $ 1 million grant from @entity119 's @entity118 , after @entity121 users voted for the organization			0
long before @entity0 became an @entity9 fighter , she grew up in a working - class family from @entity125			1
she always felt underprivileged , until she became involved in community service			0
that 's when she decided to dedicate her life to helping people			0
@entity0 has since won a number of awards and has been recognized for her work in @entity12			1
she was one of the @entity9 fighters honored as @entity135 's @entity134 in 2014			0
" i 'm not the same person that i was before @entity9 hit , " said @entity0			1
reflecting on the months she spent fighting @entity9 , she said , " the people on the front lines that were risking their lives were the people who were fighting for their own lives , who were fighting for their children 's lives			0
" now it is about learning to live with @entity9 , said @entity0 , whose school has dozens of students who are @entity9 orphans and survivors			1
@entity0 continues to focus on girls and education in @entity12 , meeting with tech giants and innovative education labs to come up with ways to better serve her students at @entity154 .			1

@entity0 worked with the community in @entity12 slum to develop @entity9 response
dozens of @entity9 orphans now attend more than @entity19
