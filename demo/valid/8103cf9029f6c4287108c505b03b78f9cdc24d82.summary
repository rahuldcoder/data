" we have to be clear about this , " @entity0 said			2
that 's going to make this all the more complicated for the investigators , the public , to accept , to understand ... why deadly force had to be used			2
" the officer who killed @entity2 , 12 - year department veteran @entity15 , had used deadly force before , shooting and killing a man in 2007 , the chief said			1

after the shooting , protesters in the university town took to the streets and converged on @entity58 , chanting " black lives matter			1

police described @entity2 as @entity73			1
" in light of so much things that have happened not just across the country , but in our own community , it 's understandable that the reaction at the scene and of some of our citizens is extremely volatile , emotional and upsetting , " the police chief told @entity1 affiliate @entity75			1
" and we understand that			2
that 's absolutely appropriate under these circumstances			2
we would urge , obviously , that everyone exercise restraint			2
" @entity0 said he visited the home of @entity2 's mother late friday and met @entity2 's grandparents outside the house			1

" to die in such a violent way baffles me			0
" @entity112 said @entity2 served as a father figure to her other children			1

the incident started when authorities got a call that a black male was yelling and jumping in front of cars , @entity0 said			0
dispatchers identified him as @entity2 , according to 911 audio obtained by @entity75			1
a little later the dispatcher says , " apparently @entity2 hit one of his friends , um no weapons seen			1

he tried to strangle another patron			0
" about 30 seconds later , an unidentified officer says , " shots fired , shots fired			1
" when @entity15 went to the apartment , he heard some commotion and forced his way in , @entity0 said			0
" once inside the home the subject involved in this incident -- the same one allegedly out in traffic and that had battered someone -- assaulted my officer , " @entity0 said			1
after that , according to the chief , " the officer did draw his revolver and subsequently shot the subject			1

@entity0 said he 's not sure what @entity2 was doing at the house in the first place			1
" his relationship to the home is unclear to me , although there were certainly familiar acquaintances			0
this was not a random place			0
" in a statement saturday , state attorney general @entity171 said he " can only imagine the heartbreak " of @entity2 's parents and added he 's " concerned for the officer ... who , i imagine , is experiencing great trauma as well			1
" " they are all in my thoughts and prayers , " @entity171 said			0
under @entity5 law , officer - involved shootings are investigated by an outside agency , in this case the @entity184			1

" praying for @entity4 tonight , " wrote one activist			0
" @entity210 , sit in , walk out - until u get answers			0
and until there are no more hashtag eulogies			0
" mayor @entity215 spoke to the raw feelings , calling what happened " an enormous tragedy			0
" " we 've got a family that 's really hurting , " @entity215 said , according to @entity75			0
" and we 've got a city and neighborhood that 's feeling pretty well hurt itself			0
" some of the protesters were members of the @entity225 that was formed last summer after the @entity226 shooting in @entity66			2
the group wants more reactive policing in @entity231 - @entity230 neighborhoods , said group member @entity232			0
