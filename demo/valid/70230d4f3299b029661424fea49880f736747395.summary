well , i 'll be the first to admit , i got caught off guard on this one			1
if indeed the assessment of the cockpit voice recording of @entity6 's final moments is an accurate one , it is shocking			1
it is inconceivable to me that a fellow pilot would use an airplane for his demise and the demise of his passengers			1
it is my hope that there is more to this uncanny , horrific tragedy than just an extraordinary suicide event			1
although a report of normal breathing from the co-pilot in the moments before the crash indicates that he was not incapacitated , how can one really tell ? a farfetched idea , but could he have suffered a fit of schizophrenia never diagnosed , or suffered some other mental disorder , perhaps brought on by medication ? i know , it 's not likely			1
as an airline pilot , i 'm taking this incident personally			2
why ? a pilot betrayed the public trust			2
with all the other fears -- terrorism , disappearances of planes , aircraft malfunctions -- how do i reassure my passengers that they should not add medical illness , mental or otherwise , of the pilot to the list ? for the moment , i 'll have to believe that my customers are intelligent enough to realize that the @entity48 co-pilot is an anomaly			1
sure , as with any profession , pilots have isolated cases of stress - related troubles			1
but we have mechanisms to deal with such problems			2
one mechanism is very simple : do n't fly			2
it is incumbent upon us to determine our own fitness for duty			1
as a matter of fact , on every trip , i have to confirm that status before i electronically sign the flight plan			2
whether it 's as simple as suffering from the common cold or suffering from the distraction of a nasty divorce , airline pilots can just say " no " to flying			1
as part of the hiring process , we completed a psychological evaluation			2
with my airline , one part of the evaluation involved a written test that asked obscure questions in different ways			2
another part of the test involved pilots listening to an air traffic control recording made during the angst of a thunderstorm event while at the same time completing a battery of math and shape - orientation problems			1
we were then asked questions specific to the conversations between the air traffic controllers and pilots we 'd heard in the recording			1
the test was a measure of our multitasking abilities and our abilities to deal with stress			2
in addition , the airline 's doctor conducted an individual mental evaluation			2
airline pilots in the @entity102 are required by the @entity103 to take a medical examination once every six months			1
the examination is mostly physical , but the doctor is expected to ask some basic mental health questions , most of them about depression or alcohol consumption			0
in addition to requiring pilots to indicate any prior health issues during the previous six months , the application for the exam also compels us to self - disclose the use of medications , specifically for the treatment of depression			1
if we have consulted a therapist , that also has to be disclosed			0
yes , all bets are off if we deceive the system by hiding things from it , but by every indication , this rarely occurs			0
the consequence for deception is having your @entity103 pilot 's license suspended			0
when it comes to experiencing stress , airline pilots are no different than anyone else			1
but we tend to deal with stress internally			0
i have been trained as a peer support volunteer in critical - incident stress management , a joint program between the pilots union and my airline uses as a debriefing method to talk pilots through any serious event experienced in flight			1
the idea is to mitigate any post-traumatic stress associated with such an event , and occasionally the process would uncover personal issues that would be referred to other support providers , like mental health professionals			0
i have found that my colleagues demonstrate an above - average ability to compartmentalize their problems and not let personal issues affect their job performance ... most of the time , of course			1
if personal issues invade the cockpit , mechanisms are in place to assist			0
what mechanisms ? at my airline , both the company and the pilot 's union work in unison			0
programs to assist a pilot experiencing problems are just a phone call away			0
and if there is concern about a colleague 's mental health , we can contact one of these programs on the other pilot 's behalf , anonymously if necessary			0
in some circumstances a pilot can be removed from duty			0
at every recurrent training period , the curriculum includes a presentation reminding us of these mechanisms			0
yes , as with all human systems , somebody will fall through the cracks			0
even a good psychiatrist can miss an impending suicide			0
redesigning an airplane cockpit based on the infinitesimal chance that another @entity48 co-pilot is out there seems like an overreaction			1
if passengers require reassurance of my sanity , then it would be best to more actively promote the mechanisms already in place			0
we can start with education			0
as i fly back from @entity208 today , i am certain that the @entity211 @entity210 hero beside me , who dealt with enemy missiles and raising a family , will do nothing other than an exemplary job			0
i am honored to call him my co-pilot .			0

@entity219 : fliers should know that @entity48 crash is anomaly ; airlines have procedures for *vetting* pilots ' fitness
he says psych evaluations , medical exams , peer - *oversight* *protocols* keep such disasters rare
