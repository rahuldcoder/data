@entity1 and allied warplanes struck rebels in @entity4 on thursday , with @entity1 threatening to send ground troops and inserting itself into its southern neighbor 's civil war , potentially opening up a broader sectarian conflict in the @entity10			1
the swift and sudden action involved 100 @entity1 jets , 30 from the @entity13 , 15 each from @entity14 and @entity15 , 10 from @entity16 , and a handful from @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 , plus naval help from @entity22 and @entity23 , according to a @entity1 adviser			1
the @entity23 state news agency on thursday quoted @entity23 's @entity26 as saying @entity23 's support also could involve ground forces			0
what do those countries have in common ? they 're all predominantly @entity32 -- in contrast to the @entity35 rebels , @entity34 who have taken over @entity4 's capital of @entity37 and on wednesday captured parts of its second - largest city , @entity41			1
the @entity1 consider the @entity35 proxies for the @entity34 government of @entity44 and fear another @entity34 - dominated state in the region			1
" what they do not want is an @entity44 - run state on their southern border , " @entity2 military analyst lt. col. @entity47 said of the @entity1			1
the airstrikes did not include warplanes from the @entity55 , which has worked with @entity4 governments -- including that of recently deposed but still battling president @entity58 -- to go after @entity59			1
in fact , a senior official in president @entity62 's administration said " there will be no military intervention by the @entity55 " but @entity55 secretary of state @entity66 on thursday did tell foreign ministers from @entity1 , the @entity13 , @entity16 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity68 that the @entity55 commends the military action and is supporting it through intelligence sharing , targeting assistance and logistical support , according to a senior @entity74 official			2
how did @entity4 get to this place ? @entity35 supreme leader @entity76 spoke live thursday night in @entity4 on @entity77 , saying , " if any army try to invade our country , we will prove that @entity4 will be a grave for those who invade us			1
" he added , " we call on the invaders to stop the attacks and if the airstrikes do not end then we will escalate in the needed manner			2
" @entity44 denounced the military intervention			2
@entity88 , a spokeswoman for the country 's @entity26 , said the operation will throw an already complicated situation into further turmoil and disrupt chances at a peaceful resolution to @entity4 's monthslong internal strife			1
it also wo n't help a region already facing terrorist threats from groups like @entity100 and @entity59 , she said			0
" this is a dangerous action against international responsibilities to respect countries ' national sovereignty , " @entity88 said , according to a report in @entity44 's state - run @entity102			1
@entity107 -- 60 % of whose citizens are @entity34 , with about 20 % being @entity110 -- offered similar , albeit a bit more muted opposition to what its @entity26 called " the military interference of the @entity115 , " which is made up of @entity15 , @entity14 , @entity68 , @entity16 , @entity1 and the @entity13			2
" we call on the @entity118 states to live up to their role to support national dialogue ( that includes ) all political forces to find a political solution for the crisis , " the @entity107 ministry said			0
the @entity35 are a minority group that has emerged as the most powerful player in @entity4			1
in addition to airstrikes , the @entity1 adviser said 150,000 troops could take part in an operation in @entity4			1
just a day in , the coalition airstrikes are already costing the @entity35			1
hundreds of explosions ripped through @entity37 overnight , said journalist @entity135 , who is staying in the capital			0
the @entity140 reported 18 dead and 24 wounded in @entity37 , the @entity35 - run @entity139 said			2
while @entity37 was a focus -- airstrikes destroyed the @entity35 ' combat and control operations there , the @entity1 adviser said -- it was n't the only place struck			1
compounds and military installations in @entity149 and @entity150 also were targeted			0
by thursday afternoon , the @entity1 controlled @entity4 airspace , the adviser said , and the military threatened to destroy any naval ships trying to enter @entity4 ports			1
the military operation , dubbed @entity158 , was launched after the @entity35 rebuffed an initiative by the @entity115 , @entity156 chief @entity155 said in a speech thursday			0
it was done in accord with a joint @entity118 defense treaty , @entity155 said			0
specifically , the strikes aim to support @entity58 , who was ousted in january after talks with the @entity35 faltered , but still claims to be @entity4 's rightful leader			1
" we are determined to protect the legitimate government of @entity4 , " said @entity167 , the @entity1 ambassador to the @entity55 , in announcing the beginning of the military campaign			1
" having @entity4 fail can not be an option for us or for our coalition partners			2
" why is @entity1 bombing @entity4 ? @entity167 told @entity2 's " @entity179 " that @entity1 was concerned that the @entity35 had control over @entity4 's armed forces ballistic missiles and air force , and the fact that @entity44 backs the @entity35 was troubling			1
" this is really a war to defend the legitimate government of @entity4 and protect the @entity4 people from takeover by a radical militant group aligned with @entity44 and @entity184 , " he said			1
@entity55 military commanders said they did n't know about @entity1 's action until the last minute			2
" we have been discussing this matter with the @entity55 in principle for many months , " @entity167 said			0
" we have been discussing this matter in more detail as the time approached and the final decision to take action did n't really happen until the last minute , because of circumstances in @entity4			0
" @entity23 foreign minister @entity195 on thursday proposed a joint @entity118 military " to deal with these challenges			0
" but at least one major player in @entity4 besides the @entity35 -- the @entity199 , which is the party of longtime leader @entity201 -- thinks the @entity1 and their partners should stay out			1
the @entity199 says the airstrikes have already led to civilian casualties			0
the best way to stop the bloodshed is to bring everyone to the negotiating table , the group said			0
" the ( party ) expresses its rejection of the attack on the @entity4 and the capital , @entity37 , considering what ( is ) happening is an internal affair , " the @entity199 said			0
" ... the @entity199 ( calls on all parties ) to return to and accelerate the completion of a national , historic agreement that ... maintains unity and democracy			0
" meanwhile , the last person to be elected president of @entity4 -- even if he was the only one on the ballot -- is out of the country and will soon be headed to @entity23 to petition @entity118 officials , according to @entity4 officials			2
the location of @entity58 had been a mystery for days , with conflicting reports about whether he 'd left @entity4 and where he 'd gone			0
@entity1 's state news agency , @entity231 , reported that @entity58 arrived thursday in @entity232 , where he met with the @entity1 defense minister and intelligence chief			2
but two @entity4 officials close to @entity58 said that the deposed president is in @entity68			0
they said that his next stop , on friday , will be an @entity156 summit in @entity239 , @entity23			0
meanwhile , some 3,000 to 5,000 troops from the @entity1 - led coalition are expected to reach @entity41 , the @entity4 city that was @entity58 's last known location , in the next three days , according to the officials			1
their aim is to make that port city safe enough for @entity58 to return after the @entity156 summit			0
whether the rest of @entity4 will be secure at that point is another matter			0
unfortunately , there has been little in the last few months to inspire optimism that peace is around the corner			0
opinion : why @entity4 has come undone @entity2 's @entity262 , @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity260 and @entity261 contributed to this report .			2
