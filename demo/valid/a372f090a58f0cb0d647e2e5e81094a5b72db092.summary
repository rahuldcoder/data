a migrant worker whose life ended in @entity3 after police shot at him 17 times			1
a father of four killed by an officer during a traffic stop in @entity9			1
a man killed during a robbery investigation in @entity12			1
after three @entity14 citizens were killed by police in the @entity17 in the past month , @entity14 's @entity13 says the @entity18 should step in			1
" given that these incidents can not be looked at in isolation , the @entity14 government has called for the @entity17 @entity18 through its civil rights division to monitor the investigation of these three cases to assure that they 're conducted with transparency and where appropriate , the proper criminal or civil responsibility is determined , " @entity14 's @entity13 said on monday			1
the @entity14 government 's statement comes amid a debate that has surged across the @entity17 about whether police are using excessive force , particularly when they deal with minority groups			1
" adding to our consternation over the third case of a @entity14 killed by an excessive use of force in less than one month , is our deep concern for the effect of the break in trust between the @entity43 community and the police forces that could result from these actions , " the foreign ministry said			1
investigators said they 're still piecing together information on all three cases			0
no charges have been filed			0
here 's a look at what we know so far : protesters at a city council meeting in @entity55 , @entity9 , this week chanted a familiar refrain : " hands up ! do n't shoot ! " for the demonstrators , the chant -- which started as a call to action after the police shooting death of @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity64 -- has become a rallying cry for another case			1
police shot 31 - year - old @entity69 in the @entity71 suburb of @entity72 , @entity9 , on february 20			1
investigators say the case started when a burglar alarm sounded at a business			0
@entity69 's car , which was in the area , was followed by police in what authorities described as a high - speed chase			1
eventually , @entity69 pulled over			0
@entity69 was unarmed , but in early reports about the shooting , police said an altercation erupted after he disobeyed an officer 's commands during a traffic stop			1
the traffic stop was caught on camera , but police have n't released the dash cam video to the public			1
" there will be more information released as the investigation continues			0
this additional information may shed more light on mr. @entity69 's actions that night , " police and city officials said			1
" we look forward to the time that the community can review the dash cam video of this incident , which we believe will answer many questions and correct some misconceptions about this incident			1
" @entity69 's family said they 've seen the video , and even though it does n't show the officer or the shooting , they said one thing is clear : @entity69 was unarmed and did nothing to threaten the officer who stopped him			1
@entity118 said it was jarring to hear what his brother - in - law said in the video as he gets out of the vehicle			0
" my brother - in - law is out of the car with his hands up , " @entity118 said , " and the first thing he asks is , ' are you going to kill me ? ' " @entity130 , @entity69 's wife , said her husband made a mistake when he did n't stop when the officer tried to pull him over			1
but she said he was trying to cooperate and turn himself in			0
" he was painted like a criminal who was involved in a robbery and had assaulted an officer , and in the video you do n't see any of those things , " she said			0
" you see the opposite , a man who is scared , who is simply trying to calm the situation , who sees that the police officer has a weapon in his hands			2
" police say @entity150 , 28 , was killed february 27 after a shooting broke out during a robbery investigation			1
" at this time we need the process to continue in order to know what happened , " @entity154 , @entity12 , police chief @entity153 told @entity0 en @entity155			2
he declined to comment on the investigation , but said @entity161 had been arrested in the past for various crimes , including narcotics possession , possessing stolen property , domestic violence and resisting police			1
when police came across his car last week , he was wanted for a series of robberies , @entity153 said			2
" he did not cooperate with the police and we know that a police officer shot various times at him and he died at the scene , " @entity153 said			2
and police , he said , found a replica of a gun inside the car			2
" we do not know if this is the reason why the police officer used force			2
that will be investigated , " @entity153 said			0
@entity161 's family said they do n't believe police were justified in opening fire			1
" whatever it was , he did not deserve to die this way , " said @entity161 , @entity150 's sister			2
" he did not deserve for them to shoot at him like they did			0
" the @entity195 reported that at a press conference on tuesday , @entity161 's brother , @entity197 , described police as " a gang with a badge			1
" the officer who shot @entity161 has been suspended with pay until the investigation is finished , police said			2
a proud laborer from @entity14 , @entity205 picked fruit in the orchards of @entity209 , but when his most valuable tools -- his hands -- became injured last year , he fell into deep despair			1
he could n't work or send money to family in @entity14 , two routines that shaped his life			1
it was this misfortune that distressed @entity205 in the days before he and police in @entity219 , @entity3 , clashed in february , in a confrontation that ended with officers firing 17 bullets , hitting @entity205 several times and killing him			2
he was unarmed but was accused of pelting police with rocks			2
police have said that @entity205 , 35 , was throwing rocks at cars and trucks when confronted by officers			2
he then allegedly stoned two officers , and police resorted to deadly force , authorities said			0
officers had used a taser on him , but it was n't effective , police said			0
the shooting now haunts his family , due in no small measure to how the hail of police bullets was captured on videos and posted on @entity243 by bystanders			0
@entity205 ' family said his limited @entity246 left him unable to understand the officers ' commands , shouted in @entity246			0
his mother , @entity249 , said she did n't see her son throwing rocks in the videos			0
" the only thing i can see is that he 's running , he raises his hands and they still shoot him			0
why ? i ask myself			0
why ? " @entity205 said			0
@entity257 , an aunt of @entity205 , also found it very difficult to accept the police version of events , she said			0
" we are living with profound pain from how he died , and it 's something very bad and terrible , " the aunt said			0
" i look at the videos now and i can not sleep because it 's too hard			0
" @entity0 's @entity267 , @entity268 and @entity269 contributed to this report .			0

in the past month , three @entity14 nationals have been killed in @entity17 police shootings
@entity14 's @entity13 says the shootings " can not be looked at in isolation "
