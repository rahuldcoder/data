@entity0 has learned that the manufacturer of the endoscope involved in two superbug deaths at @entity4 never obtained permission to sell the device , according to an official at the @entity8			1
@entity9 started selling its @entity10 in 2010 , but the @entity8 did n't notice until late 2013 or early 2014 that the company had never asked for clearance to put it on the market , according to @entity14 , deputy director of strategy for the @entity8 's @entity16			1
" why did n't we notice it ? i do n't know , " @entity19 said			0
" can you imagine a prescription drug getting out on the market that did n't go through the approval process ? " asked dr. @entity20 , the chief of cardiovascular medicine at the @entity22 , who 's testified to @entity23 about device safety problems			1
" devices need to be regulated more vigorously			0
" in a statement , @entity9 said it did n't think needed the @entity8 's permission to sell the device , but now at the request of the agency , it has applied for that permission			1
that application is still pending			0
seven hospital patients at @entity39 were infected with the deadly superbug @entity40 -- also known as carbapenem - resistant @entity42 -- from october to january , according to hospital officials			1
two of those patients died			0
the patients caught @entity40 after routine endoscopic treatments			1
hospital officials believe two medical scopes that still carried the deadly bacteria even after disinfection guidelines were followed were the cause of the superbug outbreak			2
the medical center has contacted 179 others who had endoscopic procedures between october and january and is offering them home tests to screen for the bacteria			2
four other patients at @entity60 in @entity61 have also been infected with the superbug linked to a contaminated duodenoscope , according to a statement released by the hospital			0
the medical scope was used in all four patients , between august and january 2015			2
sixty - four other patients who had a duodenoscope procedure with that particular scope are being informed by mail , " out of an abundance of caution			0
" according to @entity8 rules , a manufacturer must seek clearance for a new model if it includes changes that " could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device			1
" the @entity84 - @entity83 duodenoscope , used to check out ducts in the gastrointestinal system , includes a modification to the exact part of the device that 's been implicated in the superbug outbreaks			2
with this new model , @entity9 sealed up that part of the device , known as the elevator channel , hoping to make it more impervious to infection			1
" the company clearly made these modifications to make the device safer , but it seems to be that it was n't safer , " @entity19 said			2
last year , at the @entity8 's request , @entity9 applied for permission to sell the scope			1
that application is still pending			0
@entity19 emphasized that duodenoscope procedures can be lifesaving , so the agency does n't want to take them off the market			0
" more than 500,000 of these procedures are done every year in the @entity105 , and the risk of bacterial transmission is actually really very , very low , " she said			0
" we believe the benefits outweigh the risks			0
" in its statement , @entity9 wrote : " the emergence of drug - resistant microorganisms is a challenge to the entire health care community			2
@entity9 is working with relevant medical societies and our customers in research of this emerging issue and the development of additional safeguards to prevent infection associated with [ duodenoscope procedures ]			1
" @entity19 noted that the other two duodenoscope manufacturers , @entity124 and @entity125 , did apply for and were granted clearance to market models similar to @entity9 ' @entity128			2
now the @entity8 is asking all three companies to submit evidence that the scopes can be thoroughly cleaned -- and so far it 's not going well			1
@entity19 said twice the companies have submitted data that failed to show that cleaning could get rid of 99.9999 % of all microbes on the scope -- the @entity8 's standard for disinfection			1
" we 're still working with them to get good data , " she said			0
@entity19 said she does n't know if the @entity8 will penalize @entity9 for selling the device without permission			1
@entity146 , a device safety expert , said they should			0
" it 's like with kids			0
how do you teach your children to behave if there are no consequences when they misbehave ? " she said .			0
