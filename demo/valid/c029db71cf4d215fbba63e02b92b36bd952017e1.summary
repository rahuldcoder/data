@entity0 this is a tale of two storms			1
the one that ( kind of ) hit @entity0 and the one that hit everywhere else			1
ask folks along a line from @entity8 to @entity9			1
unlike last year , when city officials were caught completely by surprise , @entity0 was prepared this time			1
but the storm stayed north of town			1
it did do some damage , slicking up roads and knocking out power to tens of thousands of people			1
still , @entity20 2015 it was n't			1
@entity22 gov. @entity21 did his part			1
he ordered a state of emergency for 51 northern counties			1
there were more snow plows , more trucks to spread brine and they were out in force ahead of the bad weather			1
and people helped out by staying home or leaving work early			2
still , social media was n't about to give the governor a break			2
" as a stockholder of a grocery store here , i appreciate you guys invoking a false panic again			2
# @entity47 , " tweeted @entity46			2
@entity49 of the city , there was lots of snow , especially in the mountains , but @entity0 mainly got rain			2
it was a disappointing prospect for those who had their hearts set on making a snowman from a rare snowfall			2
" serious question , how am i supposed to build a snowman with rain ? " asked @entity60			2
" lol , a little imagination and your freezer , " responded @entity64			2
other parts of the @entity69 found enough snow to put together more than your basic snowman			2
in northeast @entity73 they were channeling " @entity77 " and the ice planet @entity78 in creating a snowy version of an @entity76 walker			2
in @entity80 , the snow inspired a host of @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 to spread their wintry magic " @entity88 " style			1
by early thursday , the storm system had largely left the @entity69 behind , instead spreading a blanket of white on the @entity92 and northward			0
@entity94 gov. @entity93 noted that this marked the second time in two years that a major winter storm covered his entire state			1
there were no casualties or major injuries , thankfully , but the central part of the state got up to 7 inches while a few inches fell in the east			0
it was n't just that snow fell , but the type of snow -- heavy stuff that snapped branches and weighed down power lines , especially in @entity114 and @entity115 counties			1
that led to some 224,000 @entity118 customers being in the dark at one point , a number that had fallen to about 78,000 by 6:25 p.m. thursday			0
" the biggest issue for us , especially @entity124 to the east , was power outages , " @entity93 said			1
" that is something that ... we did n't anticipate			0
" thankfully , though , @entity129 were ready in other ways			0
they heeded officials ' warnings by stocking up , staying off the roads and staying safe			0
the storm did leave behind its share of slippery misery			0
@entity49 of @entity0 , @entity138 was in gridlock wednesday afternoon			0
catching flights was a nightmare in some southern cities			0
@entity0 , @entity143 and @entity144 were the hardest hit			0
some 1,600 flights were canceled at all @entity148 airports on wednesday			0
nearly 900 have been scrubbed for thursday			0
in @entity80 , @entity149 and some friends thought it would be better for them to drive home to @entity153 , @entity154 , instead of worrying with canceled flights			1
they did n't make it far			0
they were stuck on @entity159 about 30 miles north of @entity160			1
@entity149 says a hill and snow - covered roadways led to backed - up traffic for miles			1
in @entity167 , 30 weather - related deaths have been reported in the past 10 days			1
a small child died in @entity73 after the car she was in hydroplaned			0
and a student from the @entity171 in @entity172 was killed in a sledding accident wednesday			1
the @entity69 's fascination with snow is a bit bemusing for those who live north of the @entity178			0
after all , in @entity180 , they were over winter about 70 inches ago			0
" how 's the snow treating you , southern @entity148 folks ? having fun yet ? " asked @entity183 on @entity184			0
" @entity188 ! " warned @entity186 in @entity187			0
and then there was this bit of empathy from points north			0
" i love all the snow pictures of my southern friends because they actually appreciate the snow , " tweeted @entity193 .			0

*unanticipated* , *widespread* power outages the big *problem* in @entity94
