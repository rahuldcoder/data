@entity1 photographer @entity0 wanted to show that people with @entity4 are more than a chromosomal abnormality			1
they are diverse and they 're unique , just like everyone else in the world			2
@entity0 's series , " first and foremost i am , " consists of 21 portraits of people ranging from 9 months to 60 years old			1
she chose the number 21 to represent chromosome 21 , the location of the most common genetic mutation causing the condition			0
it is currently on exhibit at the @entity20 and will be featured in may at the @entity21			0
@entity0 shot the photos in 2013 and 2014 as part of a final project at @entity25 in @entity26			1
she recently shared the images with @entity28			0
the inspiration started with a radio interview @entity0 heard in which people were discussing ethical questions brought up by prenatal tests to detect birth defects			1
she hopes her photos shine a light on " the beauty and diversity of mankind " and make us wonder if a future without that diversity is desirable			1
" i am not against prenatal / genetic testing for abnormalities but i think we need to stop and think what 's next			2
... it 's necessary to open the discussion and educate people more about @entity4			1
it 's not a disease or a flaw			2
parents of children with @entity4 ... would n't exchange them for anything in the world			1
" the title of the series , " first and foremost i am , " comes from a newspaper article by @entity60 , a 30 - year - old woman who is also featured in @entity0 's project			1
" i have down syndrome but first and foremost i am @entity63 , " @entity60 writes			0
" i do a million things that other people do			2
my life is meaningful and good because i choose to be positive and see the good things in life			0
i go to work , attend school and have hobbies			0
" @entity60 goes on to say , " who is perfect ? who can say , that we who have down syndrome are worth less that anyone else ? we are all different and would it be so great if we were all alike ? " @entity0 staged the portraits against a floral background because she wanted the subjects " to stand out but also underline that all kinds of flowers can grow and flourish together			1
" the photo shoots lasted from one to three hours			0
she said she did n't give any coaching or direction for how they should pose ; she just talked with them and waited for the right moment to shoot			0
" my favorite part of this project was how relaxed the atmosphere was			0
no one was pretending to be anything , the emotions were real and some of the times , there was such genuine happiness			0

@entity0 's portraits show people with @entity4 from 9 months to 60 years old
she hopes her photos shine a light on " the beauty and diversity of mankind "
