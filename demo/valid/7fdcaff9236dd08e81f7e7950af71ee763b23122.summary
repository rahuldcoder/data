about 15 years ago , i was doing research on inheritance laws in @entity4 and their impact on women			1
part of my research methodology was to engage in focus group discussions with women in village settings			0
in order to do this in any village in @entity4 , one has to seek permission from the village chief			2
the chief told me to come back the next day so that he can have time to mobilize the women , as well as give them proper notice of the proposed discussion			0
when i came back the next day , the " women " had indeed gathered waiting for me			0
however i noticed that the " women " were not women , as such			0
i said to the chief " i was hoping to talk to women and not to kids or girls , as i do n't think they would understand much about inheritance			0
" his response was , " but these are our women ; look , they have babies with them and they are all married			0
then it dawned on me , " aah , girl - child marriages			0
" after asking , i found the girls ' ages ranged from 13 to 18 , with two being 24			2
this then spurred me into action and it was the beginning of a decade - plus journey of understanding girl - child marriages in my country and fighting for the practice to end			2
what i found out was disheartening as the statistics came in			0
i was horrified to learn that @entity4 has one of the highest rates of child marriage in the world			1
it is ranked eighth of the 20 countries that are considered to have the highest rates of child marriage by the @entity58			1
on average , one out of two girls in @entity4 will be married by their 18th birthday , according to the @entity62			1
in 2010 , half of the women ( 50 % ) aged 20 -- 24 years were married or in a union before age 18 ( compared to 6.4 % of boys ) , while 12 % of women married before they were 15 compared to only 1.2 % of men			1
child marriage is in both rural and urban areas			1
it is also higher than the regional average for @entity74 ( 37 % )			0
' law , save the girls ! ' being a lawyer , i looked to the law			0
" my hero the law , save the girls , " i thought ! yet , i soon found out that this was a complex story			0
the @entity84 of @entity4 , which is the supreme law of the land from whom all legal authority is derived , has provided for some measures of protection for all children			1
however the same @entity84 defines children as those aged 16 and below			2
the @entity62 defines children as those aged 18 and below and so to that extent the @entity84 does not comply with international standards on definitions of childhood			2
the @entity84 also allows marriages of persons aged 18 and below and it does not have a cut - off point where marriage is actually prohibited			1
this means for all intents and purposes , the @entity103 of @entity4 allows child marriages			2
alas the law had failed me ! false hope ? but there was hope in the air			0
in february , @entity4 's parliament passed the @entity113 of 2015 into law			1
this law was born amid the outcry against girl - child marriage , as the country had realized the dangers of girl - child marriage			1
save for a few areas , it is a very progressive piece of legislation , particularly from a women 's rights perspective			0
among other things , the law prohibits marriage for anybody below the age of 18			0
so , does it mean that the constitutional provisions fall away ? the spanner in the works is that since the @entity84 allows marriage below the age of 18 , the new law to the extent that it prohibits child marriage is invalid			1
so whilst many have celebrated the new law , i have n't , as girls remain shackled by a @entity145 provision that basically allows child marriage			1
so until the @entity84 changes and recognizes children as those aged 18 and above , and therefore puts marriage age at 18 giving many girls the opportunity to go to school and get educated , i will remain sad as i was 15 years ago			1
' guarantee for poverty ' i will remain sad because i know the cost of child marriage			2
it deprives girls of education and undermines their self - confidence and self - identity			0
it also makes them prone to physical and emotional abuse by their so called husbands			0
further to this , girl - child marriage inevitably means early parentage and higher risks of maternal mortality			1
as if this is not enough , studies have shown that girl - child marriage is a risk factor in the transmission of @entity178 and other sexually transmitted infections , as young wives do not have much bargaining power to negotiate safe sex with older men			1
girl - child marriages need to be prohibited tough the @entity84 because they are a violation of every conceivable human right including the right to life , health , education , human dignity and development			2
what i know for sure child marriage is a guarantee for poverty among girls in my country and i want it to end			1
more from @entity204 voices more from opinions the views expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			0

50 % of girls in @entity4 will be married by the time they turn 18
studies show the practice increases the risks of *childbirth* for both mother and infant
new laws *preventing* child marriage are still *overruled* by @entity4 's @entity84
