sen. @entity2 's @entity1 's perfunctory announcement on friday that he wo n't seek re-election next year -- leaving a vacancy for leadership of the @entity7 -- was followed , hours later , by a matter - of - fact statement in an interview with the @entity10 : " i think @entity11 should be able to succeed me			1
" that would usher in a whirlwind of activity on @entity15 in the next year as @entity17 's senior senator prepares to seize the reins of power -- and retool the party as a center - left powerhouse that can win and hold a majority in 2016 and beyond			2
left - leaning activists have begun scrambling to block @entity11 's rise			1
the progressive organization @entity25 is calling for sen. @entity26 to seek the leadership post , and the left - leaning @entity29 website is circulating a poll seeking other challengers and denouncing @entity11 as too close to the " @entity33 wing " of the @entity34			1
with more than a year to go before @entity7 will choose a new leader , anything can happen			2
but after watching @entity11 in action for more than 20 years , i 'd be surprised if he gets outsmarted in a political moment he has literally been working for a generation to create			2
with more than $ 13.4 million on hand in his campaign coffers , @entity11 has more money than all but one member of the @entity7 -- and is the only @entity46 in the top 10 in that category			1
he ran the @entity49 when it took the majority in 2006 -- and while @entity7 lost the majority during his second stint in the job in 2012 , the field looks far more promising for them in 2016 : republicans must defend 24 seats , while @entity7 need to protect only 10			0
@entity11 brings an extraordinary level of personal political skill to the leadership fight			0
even among the 100 - member @entity7 -- home to a great many ambitious politicians with big egos -- @entity11 has long operated at a high - octane level of smarts and media - savvy brashness that impress and occasionally startle his colleagues			1
@entity70 @entity69 , a longtime lion of the @entity7 , once quipped that the most dangerous place to be in the @entity15 is between @entity11 and a television camera			2
the joke stuck -- but behind the gag is a sign of grudging respect for a man who excels at the basic block - and - tackle necessities of political life			0
@entity11 is attuned to television and radio ( growing up in the world 's media capital will do that )			0
in fact , he popularized a practice of holding press conferences on sunday , a slow news day guaranteed to draw reporters -- and ensure him prominent placement in the monday newspapers			0
but he is also a consummate street politician : at 64 , he maintains a habit of biking around @entity96 neighborhoods without fanfare or an entourage , quietly noting local problems and occasionally inviting himself into a block party or parade			0
when a reporter once casually asked him to name all 62 counties of @entity17 , @entity11 did her one better , and hand - sketched a map of the state with all the counties filled in			0
( he visits every county in the state every year			0
) @entity11 is n't the only politically ambitious kid from @entity110 -- before attending @entity111 , he graduated from a public school , @entity113 , whose alumni include @entity116 @entity115 , sen. @entity117 and ex- sen. @entity118 of @entity119 ( a childhood pal of @entity11 's )			1
but @entity11 's political climb been a long - term work in progress			1
he emerged on the national stage as a prime sponsor of the @entity125 of 1994 , a law that banned assault weapons ; in the run - up to the final vote , @entity96 practically could n't turn on television without seeing @entity11 , then a congressman , on the floor of the @entity133 , waving a rifle over his head as he argued for the ban			0
the higher profile served him well a few years later , when @entity11 took on -- and defeated -- three - term incumbent sen. @entity138			0
as a senator on the rise , @entity11 attracted politically ambitious staffers who moved on to high - profile positions where they can help their former mentor			2
a very partial list of those includes @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148 , who went on to help run @entity150 's 2008 campaign ; @entity151 , who is now shaking up the world of finance as @entity17 's top banking regulator ; @entity155 , who has become an anti-corruption powerhouse as a @entity158 attorney ; and @entity159 , who is executive director of the state 's @entity34			0
with allies , money and the blessing of @entity1 , @entity11 is in a prime position to implement the ideas contained in his important and overlooked 2007 book , " @entity167 , " which lays out a vision for how @entity7 should lead @entity158			1
like @entity11 himself , the book is savvy , hopeful and politically attuned to the desires of middle - class voters			1
those who wonder what a @entity11 @entity7 leadership would look like should take a look as @entity7 prepare for what could well be the start of the @entity11 era on @entity15 .			1

@entity1 wants @entity11 to succeed him as @entity7 minority leader
@entity183 : but some on left want to block @entity11 's rise to leadership post
louis says @entity11 is tuned into middle - class voters , could create new @entity34 era
