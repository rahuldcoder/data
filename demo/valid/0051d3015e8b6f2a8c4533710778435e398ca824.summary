three and a half decades after calling for homosexuals to be stoned , former @entity1 president @entity0 has apologized			1
" i take personal ownership of this inflammatory rhetoric , " @entity0 said			1
" this reckless statement was made in the heat of a political controversy 35 years ago			2
" the weekend apology came days after the conservative @entity11 school in @entity12 received a petition asking for an apology for a statement @entity0 made to the @entity16 in 1980 at the @entity17			1
" i 'm sure this will be greatly misquoted , " @entity0 said at the time			1
" but it would not be a bad idea to bring the swift justice today that was brought in @entity22 's day against murder and rape and homosexuality			0
i guarantee it would solve the problem post-haste if homosexuals were stoned , if murderers were immediately killed as the @entity31 commands			2
" when he made the comments , @entity0 was part of a group of fundamentalist ministers who went to the @entity17 with 70,000 signatures on a petition opposed to extending provisions of the @entity39 to homosexuals			1
" upon now reading these long - forgotten words , they seem to me as words belonging to a total stranger -- were my name not attached , " @entity0 said in saturday 's statement			2
" i can not erase them , but wish i could , because they do not represent the belief of my heart or the content of my preaching			0
" @entity1 has long been a center of controversy for its fundamentalist stances			0
in 1975 , the school adopted rules banning interracial dating			0
@entity1 received national attention on the issue in 2000 when @entity61 , then a presidential candidate , visited the campus			0
the uproar over the ban prompted the school to drop it			0
the petition by @entity67 , a group that bills itself as a network " for lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender , queer , questioning , intersex and straight affirming people affected by @entity75 , " garnered more than 1,900 signatures			1
" we are grateful that @entity0 has taken responsibility for these words ; words that have caused deep harm for many more people than any of us knows , " the group 's website said			2
" this means a lot to us because it represents the beginning of a change in the rhetoric and conversation			0
