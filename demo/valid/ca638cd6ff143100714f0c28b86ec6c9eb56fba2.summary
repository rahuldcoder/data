@entity1 the house is primitive , constructed of baked mud and stone			0
the landscape is sparse and mountainous , with snow cover in the winter			0
the terrain is rugged and challenging for the long walks the owner liked to take with his sons			0
photographs quietly introduced as evidence in the latest major terrorism trial in @entity15 federal court offer a rare look inside @entity18 's lair -- years before @entity19 flew hijacked planes into buildings or bombed @entity23 embassies in @entity24 and even before the @entity25 placed @entity18 on its @entity26			1
still , @entity18 was preparing , hiding out in a remote , mountainous area of @entity28 known as @entity29			1
a remarkable set of photos -- the first showing @entity18 in the hideout where he would seek refuge after 9/11 -- came to light only last month in the terrorism conspiracy trial of @entity18 lieutenant @entity36 , a communications conduit for @entity19 in @entity38 in the mid- 1990s			1
@entity39 would arrange @entity18 's first television interview for @entity2 's @entity41 and @entity42 in 1997 and a sit - down for @entity45 ' @entity44 a year later			1
but before then , @entity36 called on a @entity47 print journalist , whose 1996 journey to @entity28 yielded these photos			1
@entity18 had declared war on the @entity23 and wanted more people to know it , especially in the @entity54 world			2
he reached out to @entity55 , the founder and then - editor - in - chief of @entity57 , an independent @entity58 weekly published in @entity38 that had been critical of certain @entity54 regimes and the 1991 @entity60			0
@entity55 had broken the story about @entity18 's first fatwa , or religious decree , stating his grievances against the @entity23 , such as the presence of @entity23 troops in @entity67			1
he published the entire screed in august 1996			0
the next month , @entity36 went to @entity55 's office to offer him the first print interview with the emerging jihadist leader in @entity28			1
" i was told that @entity74 was fond of my writing , he liked my style , and he wanted to meet me personally , " @entity55 recalled in an interview for @entity42 's 2006 book , " the @entity74			1
" " i was hesitant , because it was very dangerous			0
" danger aside , in november 1996 , @entity55 was airborne to @entity28			1
the date - stamped photographs from his trip -- which @entity81 detectives discovered two years later in a search of @entity36 's @entity38 home -- show a healthy , relaxed , sometimes smiling @entity18 , not yet 40 , conversing , hiking , videotaping pronouncements , surrounded by children			1
the photos also show rare images of another man who has become an influential ideologue in the global jihadist movement -- @entity91 , better known as @entity91 , a @entity92 now in his mid- 50s who has not been seen in public or heard from in a decade			1
still , @entity91 is arguably the most influential strategic thinker in @entity96 militant circles today			1
" a generation of jihadis were influenced by his teachings , " said @entity97 , a @entity2 terrorism analyst who has written about @entity91			1
" he wanted a global jihadist intifada , where people rose up and fought as individuals			1
" his teachings have deeply influenced jihadis in @entity92 -- how to build up an organization , how to win support for it , " he said			0
@entity18 , from @entity67 , first went to @entity28 in the 1980s to participate in the armed resistance to @entity111 invaders , one of thousands of @entity54 fighters defending a @entity115 nation			1
as the @entity117 jihad wound down , @entity18 began organizing @entity19 , meaning " the base , " around the border city of @entity120 , @entity121			2
by 1992 , @entity121 forced him and his fighters to leave			0
@entity18 relocated to @entity123 , @entity124 , welcomed by a new @entity96 regime			2
but after four years headquartered there , in 1996 , under pressure from the @entity23 , @entity124 made @entity18 go			1
by then , the ideologically in sync @entity128 had taken control of @entity28 , and @entity18 decided to move there			1
in may 1996 , @entity18 settled in the eastern @entity28 city of @entity131			1
his mountain fortress in @entity29 was a long drive up a dirt road he had built			2
@entity55 was driven there in a red @entity137 pickup in a twisting seven - hour drive through the mountains			0
as a photo of him shows , @entity55 donned @entity28 - style baggy trousers and a turban to get past security checkpoints and fit in			2
@entity55 met @entity18 in his cave			2
it was small , 13 by 20 feet in @entity55 's estimation , and as the new photos show , it was lined with shelves of books about the @entity151 and the @entity152			2
@entity18 liked to use the bookshelves as a backdrop for his videotaped edicts and interviews			2
the cave not only offered @entity18 a hiding place but also street credibility in the @entity115 world , as the prophet is believed to have received the revelations of the @entity151 while camped in his own mountain cave			2
after hours of conversation and an inedible dinner featuring salty cheese and sandy bread , @entity55 ended up bunking in the cave on a mattress that rested on boxes of grenades			0
" he wanted media exposure , " @entity55 recalled in the interview for @entity42 's 2006 book			2
" he wants to say , ' now i am an international figure ; i 'm not just a @entity67			0
i am aggrieved at @entity23 who are occupying @entity67 who are desecrating the @entity176			0
' " as seen in the photographs , @entity18 always carried a @entity179 - made @entity178			2
his comrades addressed him as " @entity181 , " for father of @entity181 , his eldest son			0
two younger sons , @entity184 and @entity185 , then in their early teens , sometimes were at the compound			0
as one photo shows , @entity55 and @entity18 took a two - hour walk around @entity29			1
" he loved that nature there			0
they were trying to have their own community , grow their foods , " @entity55 recalled			0
" it 's like an oasis in @entity28			1
" @entity18 's three wives and more than a dozen children did not share @entity18 's joy in living the life of medieval peasants in the @entity29 mountains , where the only light at night was from the moon and gas lanterns , and the only heat in a place where tremendous blizzards were common was a wood - burning metal stove			1
hunger was a frequent companion to the @entity18 children who lived on a subsistence diet of rice , bread , eggs and that salty cheese			2
in december 2001 , with @entity23 troops retaliating for 9/11 closing in , @entity18 fled @entity29 , eventually making his way to @entity121 , where @entity221 ended a decade - long manhunt by killing him in his @entity224 hideout , an hour north of @entity225			1
@entity55 stepped down from the helm of @entity57 in 2013 and recapped his journey in a deposition for the @entity230 trial			0
@entity39 was convicted in @entity15 federal court on february 26 and faces a possible life sentence			0
even in @entity29 , @entity55 felt @entity18 was vulnerable to intelligence agencies			1
" i thought this man would not last , " @entity55 said tuesday			0
" he was n't really well - protected			0
he was visible and moving freely			0
" in 1996 , @entity18 knew but certainly did not disclose the lethal plots he had set in motion -- the embassy bombings , the planes plot that would become 9/11			1
@entity55 said , " he was very optimistic , and it never occurred to me that this would be the most be dangerous man in the world			0
" with his pale skin , short red hair and beard , and green wool hat , @entity91 could pass for @entity246			2
but he is @entity92 , originally from the ancient city of @entity248 , fought in the @entity117 @entity28 war , and lived in @entity38 in the 1990s			2
@entity250 was close to @entity18 , which explains his comfortable presence in the 1996 photos of @entity29 , seated next to @entity19 's leader in his cave or hiking with him , carrying his own cameras			1
( @entity250 also accompanied @entity42 and @entity41 on their visit to @entity18 in 1997			2
) the @entity23 has since accused @entity91 of training recruits at @entity19 's pre- 9/11 @entity261 and @entity262 camps in @entity28 , where operatives such as @entity264 , who planned to bomb @entity265 in december 1999 , learned how to kill with poisons and chemicals			1
eventually , @entity91 publicly criticized @entity18 for making @entity19 so hierarchical , for courting publicity and being so controlling , even calling him a " @entity270 " for his imperial leadership style			1
but @entity91 was no less militant			0
he set up his own training camp in @entity28 and advocated a " leaderless jihad " featuring , as he put it , " spontaneous operations performed by individuals and cells all over the whole world without connection between them			0
" @entity250 summarized his philosophy in his 1,600 - page treatise , " @entity281 , " which he published on the internet in 2004			0
he coined the @entity58 slogan nizam , la tanzim , meaning " a system , not an organization , " to describe his belief that there should be no organizational bonds between " resistance fighters			0
" @entity250 advocated terrorist cells of no more than 10 men and envisioned more " lone - wolf " attacks , such as the @entity294 , @entity295 , massacre carried out in 2009 by rogue @entity298 maj. @entity297 , who was inspired by the radical @entity300 - @entity23 cleric @entity299 , himself an @entity91 disciple			0
strategically , @entity91 argued , a less centralized jihadist network would make operatives who were arrested less likely to expose fellow militants to intelligence or law enforcement agencies , because the fighters would not know who else was part of the movement			1
@entity250 was forward thinking about @entity19 evolving into an international ideology more than a centrally controlled organization			0
after 9/11 , @entity91 appeared on the @entity23 @entity314 list with a $ 5 million reward for information leading to his capture			1
in 2005 , @entity91 was tracked down in @entity318 , @entity121 , and sent to @entity92 , where he was imprisoned			0
there were unconfirmed reports that he was released in 2012 , followed by @entity19 statements by leader @entity322 and spokesman @entity323 in 2014 saying , " may @entity324 release him			0
" a decade after his arrest , @entity91 's whereabouts are a mystery			2
a gripping glimpse into @entity18 's decline and fall @entity331 is a fellow at the @entity332 at @entity333 and a former @entity2 senior producer			1
@entity42 is @entity2 's national security analyst .			0

photos from terrorism trial offer rare glimpse of @entity74 's hideout before 9/11
@entity47 journalist went to interview @entity18 in 1996 in @entity28 's @entity29 area
@entity91 , an influential figure in global jihadist movement , appears in images , too
