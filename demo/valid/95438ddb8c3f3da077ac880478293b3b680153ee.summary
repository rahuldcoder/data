a year ago , when dr. @entity2 was dispatched to @entity3 to investigate a series of unexplained deaths , he had little idea that he 'd be contending with an outbreak that would quickly spread from a small southern rainforest village , across borders , and around the world			1
the @entity12 outbreak , ravaging primarily @entity3 , @entity13 and @entity14 , is a year old today			1
according to one official count , it 's infected 24,000 people and killed 10,000			2
and it 's managed to do so because of an institutional failure on several levels : weak public health systems locally and a painfully slow response globally			2
but in order to get to where we are , we need to go back to how it began			2
it takes a village before the virus ravaged @entity30 , before the deaths soared into the thousands , before the outbreak triggered global fears , @entity12 struck a toddler named @entity36 the 2 - year - old boy is who researchers with @entity39 believe was the first person to contract the disease in december 2013			1
@entity36 lived in a rainforest village in southern @entity3			2
how he got infected , no one is sure , but @entity12 can be spread from animals to humans through infected fluids or tissue			1
one thing that is certain , within a month @entity12 not only took @entity36 's life , but also those of his mother , sister and grandmother			1
from there , it spread like wildfire , passing to neighboring villages and beyond when people attended the grandmother 's funeral			2
where they went , the virus followed			2
by the time dr. @entity2 landed in @entity3 , he did n't yet know that it was already too late			0
@entity2 leads the @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 team of the @entity72 , and was one of the first doctors on the ground			0
" we were following this rumor of a small cluster of unexplained deaths in @entity3 , " he said in a first - hand account of the early days of the crisis			0
" when the lab results came back , we learned that there was @entity84 in @entity30			0
" @entity2 was working with a team of logisticians , a medical anthropologist , laboratory technicians , virologists and infection prevention and control specialists			0
it was an impressive collection of professionals with the goal of rapidly assessing the situation and getting it under control , keep it localized			0
but this outbreak was different , @entity2 said			1
" person - to - person transmission had quickly spread from a rural area to a large urban city , " making it harder to contain , he said			0
" and , the outbreak was becoming multi-national ; cases were confirmed in @entity13 and were suspected in @entity14			2
" from those early days , the outbreak would mushroom			2
in july , @entity106 became the first @entity108 citizen to die at a hospital in @entity110 , @entity13			0
his case raised fears the virus could spread beyond the countries at the heart of the outbreak			2
international flights took the disease as far as @entity120 and the @entity108			0
on august 6 , a businessman with @entity12 died in a hospital in @entity123			1
he had been to @entity14 for work			0
five days later , a @entity125 died in @entity126			0
and on september 20 , the @entity125 with @entity12 , brother @entity127 , dies in @entity126			1
september 20 , a @entity13 named @entity128 arrived in @entity129 to visit relatives			0
he had been unknowingly exposed to the ebola virus -- and he became the first known case of @entity12 diagnosed in the @entity108 he died a few days later			1
meanwhile , the disease took an ugly toll in @entity30 by september , it had orphaned about 3,700 children in @entity3 , @entity13 and @entity14			0
scared relatives did n't want to take them in , and officials worried the number of kids without parents would rise higher -- much higher			0
" @entity12 is turning a basic human reaction like comforting a sick child into a potential death sentence , " said @entity144 , @entity145 's regional director			1
" we can not respond to a crisis of this nature and this scale in the usual ways			0
we need more courage , more creativity , and far , far more resources			0
" why did n't we ? in a scathing new report , published monday , @entity157 puts the blame squarely on a " global coalition of inaction " that waited months to respond to the epidemic			1
" the @entity12 epidemic proved to be an exceptional event that exposed the reality of how inefficient and slow health and aid systems are to respond to emergencies , " said said dr @entity163 , the organization 's international president in the report , " @entity165 and @entity166			1
" for example , by march 21 , 2014 , 78 victims had died , mostly in @entity3			0
the @entity72 said at the time that while the @entity12 outbreak is serious , it is " relatively small , still			1
" " for the @entity12 outbreak to spiral this far out of control required many institutions to fail , " said @entity177 , the director general for @entity157			1
" and they did , with tragic and avoidable consequences			1
" local hospitals were overwhelmed			0
by october , when @entity14 was reporting a rate of five infections an hour , @entity145 said it had received only 25 % of the $ 200 million it needed for emergency assistance for families affected by @entity12 in the region			1
a significant challenge remains ahead , @entity157 says			1
" to declare an end to the outbreak , every single person in contact with someone infected with @entity12 must be identified			1
there is no room for mistakes or complacency ; the number of cases weekly is still higher than in any previous outbreak , and overall cases have not significantly declined since late january			2
" it 's sobering news a year into the outbreak			1
although the headlines have faded a bit from public view , the threat has not			0
@entity1 's @entity212 contributed to this report .			0

the world was just starting to become *aware* of the @entity12 outbreak a year ago
the director general for @entity157 calls the outbreak " tragic and avoidable "
