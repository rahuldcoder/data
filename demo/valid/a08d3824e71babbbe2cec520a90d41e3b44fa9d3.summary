" @entity0 , the wine ! " that is an old punchline in the @entity6 home , thanks to plastic cups of @entity9 , a low bridge and a gondolier named @entity12			1
his concerned bark broke the spell as my wife and i smooched and gaped , moon - eyed dorks on our first night in @entity20			1
when i told my dad i was taking my wife to @entity22 for our first anniversary , he snorted			1
" where you gon na take her for your 10th ? the moon ? " he was right			0
pigeons in @entity30 , sunset over the @entity32 , @entity33 and cheeseburgers at @entity35 's			0
@entity20 entered our bloodstream that trip			1
but in the years since , i 've heard very different stories from disappointed folks back from their first trip to @entity43 because the city of water and love now has too much of both			2
too much water , and way too many lovers			0
because this impossible city of palazzos and cathedrals is built atop wooden posts driven into the muddy floor of a lagoon , @entity20 has been slowly sinking since @entity57 canoodled down its canals			1
when aquifers were tapped to build massive petrochemical plants on the nearby mainland , @entity20 sank faster			1
and then folks noticed that the sea level was on a slow but steady rise			0
in the 1920s , there were about 400 incidents of acqua alta , or high water , when the right mix of tides and winds drives the liquid streets up into homes and shops in the lowers parts of the city			1
by the 1990s , there were 2,400 incidents -- and new records are set every year			0
but , the @entity22 have a plan			1
it is called the @entity82			0
@entity82 is an acronym for " @entity84 , " but it is also the @entity22 word for @entity82 , a guy known for parting the sea and protecting the faithful			1
it 's a system of 78 massive gates mounted to hinges on the ocean floor			2
the gates are filled with air , and designed to rise and create a temporary sea wall			0
since the plan was hatched , low - lying cities from @entity96 to @entity97 have taken a keen interest to see if the idea can work			0
everybody is still waiting : @entity82 is now 10 years behind schedule , and $ 5 billion over budget			0
and on one early morning in 2014 , police rounded up 35 people at the highest levels of @entity82 , including @entity107 , the mayor of @entity20			1
while several went to prison on plea bargains , the now - former mayor is fighting charges of corruption and kickbacks			0
but while i went back to @entity20 to do a story on rising water , instead i found a surprising drama about the rising tide of humanity			1
people know @entity20 is special and fragile , so they come -- to the tune of 20 million tourists a year			1
meanwhile , the watery headaches and cost of living has created a mass exodus of native @entity126 : 100,000 have moved to the mainland in a single generation , and around 60,000 remain			0
on a busy summer day , in the most popular section of the city , tourists can outnumber @entity133 600 - 1			2
in @entity135 , that number is 8 - 1			0
when a cruise ship dumps thousands of people into @entity20 at once , they squeeze down jammed medieval streets where purveyors of overpriced pizza and cheap masks have replaced the shops of artists and artisans			2
each year , more people come			0
each year , less get to enjoy the city we found on that first magical night			2
people have been worrying about the impending death of @entity20 for centuries , but the place is in trouble , now more than ever			2
and in an age of rising seas and exploding populations , @entity20 is a test			1
a test to preserve beauty , history and harmony from the greatest threats : time , tide and greed .			0

@entity20 , @entity22 , has slowly been sinking
the city is testing a new system that would combat the rising tides
