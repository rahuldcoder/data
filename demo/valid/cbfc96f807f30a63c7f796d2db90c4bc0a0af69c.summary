everywhere you look there are two - wheeled drivers waiting ominously for passengers to hop on board			2
they 're the backbone of public transport in @entity9 and the fastest way to get around the capital city , @entity12			1
the boda boda motorbike taxi is a staple used by all sectors of society			1
traditionally , the usual way of catching a ride was to venture into any street corner packed with tens of boda bodas or simply waiting for one to pass by			2
but now , a new local startup are bringing this classic mode of transport into the technological age by providing the ability to hail a boda boda at the click of a smartphone			1
" @entity29 are the main thing getting people from a to @entity32 , " says @entity33 , co-founder of @entity34 , " and we 're trying to professionalize this transportation in the city			1
" the motorbike taxis have their greatest popularity globally in @entity9 , with over 80,000 riding the streets of @entity12 , according to @entity40 who wants to seize upon the country 's burgeoning young population			1
@entity9 has more than 24 % of the population aged between 10 and 19 years old , according to @entity45 -- and @entity33 wants them to get on their bikes			1
" young people use smartphones in @entity12 and it 's one of the youngest countries in the world , " he says			0
for now , the @entity54 - like startup operates mainly in the northern districts of @entity12 , where a click on the @entity34 app -- in addition to the traditional method of hailing them on the street -- will bring you a @entity64 bike , complete with a uniformed driver in a bright orange jacket , helmet and fully trained in road safety			1
he 'll even have a helmet for you			0
safety has long been a concern for those riding boda bodas as the bikes are a leading cause of death and head injury in @entity12			1
a study conducted at @entity80 in @entity12 , by researchers at @entity82 , identified approximately 40 % of trauma cases at the hospital to be due to boda - boda accidents			1
i request a @entity34 to take me to meet the team in the upmarket area of @entity89 , in @entity12 's central district			1
as i stand waiting , at least 10 regular boda bodas pass by beeping to get my attention and business			2
a driver called @entity95 then arrives who i spot clearly in the distance thanks to his bright orange jacket and orange helmets -- one on his head and one on his handlebars			2
@entity95 has been a boda driver for four years and joined @entity34 four months ago to learn more about road safety			1
he explains how he now earns more than ever before due to a loyal customer base stemming from his safe driving			0
the ride was in fact calmer than those taken with other bodas , and unlike some , as we ride along the congested streets no kerbs were scaled or mounted to avoid the traffic			0
the name stands - safeboda			0
the dangers lie in the low use of helmets -- by both drivers and users -- alongside risky driving and poor road safety practices			0
this makes many fearful of catching a two - wheeled ride but the team at @entity34 are trying to lure people back on board			1
they 're reinventing the boda boda reputation to prove they can be safe , as well as fast and economical			0
" it 's a market - based approach to road safety , " says @entity33 , an economist , who believes that as word spreads about the skills of his drivers , the income -- and safety -- of his drivers will rise and reflect this			2
" people in @entity9 do n't wear helmets , " says @entity33			2
" so how do we get them to wear helmets ? " the answer , is by providing one			0
driver training is provided in partnership with the @entity9 @entity147 and takes place for up to three weeks to cover road safety and bike maintenance -- and it seems to be working			1
since its inception in november 2014 , the fleet of drivers at @entity34 has reached 50 , currently occupying four areas towards the north and center of the city			2
the main need for safe driving is in the congested streets of downtown @entity12 where the company plans to expand into next			0
" if we train people and make them good and responsible drivers , we 're going to save lives , " says @entity162 , who manages the drivers			0
" but implementing has been a challenge , " he says about the difficulties in changing the mindsets of a population			0
the team are dreaming big , with plans to expand to 100 by the end of march and 800 by the end of 2015			0
" with over 1,000 drivers we can begin to change the entire boda industry , " says @entity33			0
