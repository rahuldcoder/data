the 1 - 0 scoreline that took @entity2 through to the @entity4 quarterfinals made their clash with @entity7 all seem rather academic			1
yet it was anything but as @entity12 's masterful first - half display had some purring once again about his status as the greatest footballer of all time			2
meanwhile , the second half witnessed another masterclass as @entity20 international @entity19 somehow kept @entity7 in a lively encounter with save after save			2
in between , the man that @entity7 usually rely on to dig them out of tight spots -- @entity25 -- failed to score a late penalty that could have set up a tense finish			2
in truth , the @entity29 champions deserved little over the two legs as @entity2 built upon their 2 - 1 victory in @entity33 three weeks ago to go through as 3 - 1 aggregate winners			1
the four - time champions may not have added the goals they deserved but they did reach the last eight for the eighth year in a row , a competition record			2
" it was a game with a lot of chances where we could have finished it off a lot earlier , " @entity2 coach @entity40 told reporters			1
" we got what we wanted which was to go through to the next round and i am happy with the display			2
we played well and this is a big boost for us at this stage of the season			0
" the high - profile scrutiny of the relationship between coach @entity40 and @entity59 superstar @entity12 suddenly seems a distant memory with @entity2 still capable of repeating their wonder year of 2009			1
on that occasion , they won the @entity4 , @entity63 and @entity64 under the guidance of @entity66 , who was one of many enthralled spectators inside the @entity68			1
now in charge of fellow quarterfinalists @entity71 , @entity66 was out of his seat -- seemingly in celebration -- as @entity74 opened the scoring after 31 minutes when lifting the ball over @entity19 following a fine pass from @entity12			1
the diminutive @entity59 flashed two free - kicks from distance onto the top of the goal netting while also displaying an array of twists , turns and embarrassing ' nutmegs ' for his opponents			0
it was enough to make former @entity20 international @entity88 , the top scorer at the 1986 @entity89 , proclaim him the best footballer ever			0
while that engrossing debate rumbles on , @entity12 set about trying to put the tie to bed but he met fierce resistance from @entity19 , who had kept @entity7 in the tie in the first leg when saving the @entity59 's injury - time penalty			0
@entity20 's number one made 10 saves , the most of any keeper in any @entity4 this season , not only repelling @entity12 but also @entity102 and @entity103 , both of whom were also denied by the post in the first half			1
to their credit , the @entity109 side -- who were looking to reach the @entity4 quarterfinals for the first time -- improved after the break but found chances hard to come by			1
that was until @entity25 won a penalty after going down under a challenge from first @entity119 , and then @entity121 colleague @entity120 , with just over ten minutes left			0
but @entity123 keeper @entity122 dived right -- in both senses -- to beat away the spotkick and ultimately seal @entity7 's fate			0
@entity2 can now prepare for sunday 's superclasico clash with @entity128 , whom they lead in the @entity63 table by one point			1
" we 've gone out to a magnificent side for the second time in two years , " @entity19 told @entity134 television			0
" they will get a lot of plaudits but we had a big chance with the penalty			0
" questions will now be asked of coach @entity143 , who had been expected to perform better in the @entity4 after @entity144 twice failed to get out of the group stages			1
it means that for the second time in three years , no @entity29 team have made the last eight , where @entity2 have joined @entity128 sides @entity128 and @entity150 , @entity71 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154			1
the latter made it through after beating @entity157 3 - 0 in @entity158 to secure a convincing 5 - 1 aggregate victory			0
on a night when @entity7 had failed to score , it was not lost on many that their former striker @entity162 netted twice and made one , converted by @entity164 , for the @entity165			0
" it was a game to forget			0
it started badly and did not get any better , " @entity157 coach @entity167 , who led his side to the 2013 @entity4 final , told reporters			1
" we deserved to be eliminated			0
" the draw for the quarterfinals will be held on friday .			2

@entity2 and @entity154 join @entity128 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity71 in @entity4 quarterfinals
