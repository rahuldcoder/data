look to the skies above @entity2 and you 'll see the usual suspects -- rainclouds , planes and pigeons			0
but by the end of the year , you might just see something else			0
longer than a soccer pitch and filled to the brim with helium , at 302 feet long , the @entity11 will be the world 's biggest aircraft			1
part blimp , part plane , part helicopter , it was originally created by @entity22 design company @entity21 ( @entity21 ) for military surveillance by the @entity24			1
but budget cuts doomed the project and @entity21 bought the airship back across the pond , where it seemed set to remain on solid ground until the company received a Â£ 3.4 million ( $ 5.1 million ) grant from the @entity22 government			1
thanks to this recent injection of financing , designers and engineers are now readying the craft for first flight tests scheduled for later this year			0
while the concept has been around for nearly a century , airships fell out of fashion following the @entity44 disaster in 1937 , when the @entity46 passenger craft erupted into flames while trying to dock , killing 36			0
while an airship might seem like a craft from a time long passed , it has been given a 21st century design overhaul and @entity21 hopes to have airships back in the skies over the @entity22 by 2016			1
@entity54 , @entity21 head of partnerships and communications , said : " the sole problems existing old - style airships had ( were ) having lots of ground crew , limited ability to carry payloads and to be susceptible to weather conditions			2
we solved all those problems with a new concept -- a hybrid aircraft			1
so a mix between a wing and an airship			0
" the @entity71 10 -- named because it can carry 10 tons -- is made of a bespoke fabric of carbon fiber , kevlar and mylar , while the pressure of the helium inside maintains the aircraft 's shape			1
diesel fuel helps the @entity71 take off and land and powers the propellers			1
the spacious cockpit is currently configured to accommodate a pilot and one observer but @entity54 says this can easily be reconfigured to end - user specifications			2
the airship also has green credentials -- its creators say the current version uses 20 % fuel burn of existing aircraft , can be fitted with solar panels , uses near - silent 325 hp @entity98 engines and can stay airborne for five days while carrying its maximum payload			2
the vehicle can also operate in extreme weather conditions ( +54 to -56 degrees @entity102 )			0
while the previous @entity24 project had military applications in mind , this time @entity21 plans to split end use 60:40 between civlian and military applications			2
@entity54 says that they 've had incredible interest from at home and abroad			0
the @entity111 has expressed interest in using the hybrid airships to monitor the nation 's coastline			2
meanwhile @entity119 firm @entity118 , in conjunction with the government , wants to use the @entity71 as an air transport system for wind turbines			1
@entity54 explained : " at the moment , the only way of doing ( transporting the equipment ) is basically plowing a 50m - wide highway through pristine @entity126 forest , which is not a good thing to do and they do n't want to destroy ecological environment			2
" showing the versatility in air transport operations the airship could have , @entity54 said the charity @entity133 is keen to task the aircraft on aid relief missions following natural disasters , while @entity21 is in talks with @entity140 's @entity139 in @entity141 , @entity142 , to help conduct scientific research			0
using airships for military purposes such as reconnaissance and surveillance is not a new idea and today faces stiff competition from drones			0
@entity151 , editor - in - chief of @entity152 , said : " the @entity71 does have one big benefit over @entity154			1
it can lift a heavier payload than most drones so allows for radars , better cameras , multiple sensors , etc. payload weight is one of biggest limiters of @entity154 -- so that would be extremely attractive to militaries looking to put larger or heavier sensors on board			0
it is also manned ( piloted ) which gives it more flexibility in being able to deploy to where it is needed			0
" @entity151 also highlighted commercial possibilities for the @entity71 , such as long - range cargo airships and humanitarian missions			1
" the ability of the airship not to need runways or airports would be very attractive for disaster relief			0
while helicopters can also land anywhere , they are limited in payload and range -- plus the @entity71 is much more efficient thanks to its hybrid ' lifting body ' design			1
" he added : " imagine a large airship being able to land with a medical emergency department on board , right at the scene of the disaster			0
" but the aviation expert is also cautiously optimistic about the future of the @entity71			2
he said there had been several " false dawns " in bringing about the return of the airship in previous years , including two military surveillance airship projects from the @entity203 @entity202 which were ultimately sidelined " because they were n't confident in the technology			1
" while @entity151 calls it " the most promising lighter - than - air vehicle project we have seen in a long time , " only successful first flight tests at the end of the year and further demos and trials will show off the @entity11 10 's true capabilities			1
until then , keep your eyes fixed to the horizon , where you might just see the future of aviation re-emerge through the clouds			0

the @entity71 10 is a *300* - feet long hybrid aircraft
originally designed for @entity203 military , it is now backed by the @entity22 government
