a federal judge has ordered the @entity2 to release photos that allegedly show detainees being abused in detention centers in @entity6 and @entity7 during the @entity9 administration			1
the photos wo n't be made public right away			0
in an order issued friday , @entity12 district judge @entity11 of the @entity13 granted the government 60 days to appeal			2
the @entity16 sued the @entity2 in 2003 to have the photos made public			1
it 's not clear how many photos are involved or where the pictures were taken , but in an august opinion @entity11 said the government acknowledged having at least 29 pictures from at least seven different locations in @entity7 and @entity6 and may have hundreds or thousands more			1
some of the photos may have come from the notorious @entity28 in @entity6			2
in 2004 , photos became public that showed @entity12 soldiers abusing @entity28 detainees and putting them into humiliating sexual positions			1
people in the @entity35 and @entity12 were outraged and shocked by the photos , which added to the national debate on the use of torture in the war on terror			2
@entity11 said the government failed to prove its argument that releasing the photos would endanger @entity12 soldiers or civilians overseas			1
in july 2011 , the judge blocked release of the photos at the urging of the secretary of defense because @entity12 troops were still fighting in @entity6			1
by december 2011 , most @entity12 ground troops had withdrawn from @entity6 , the judge wrote , and he did n't know whether release of the photos would affect military operations			1
" three years is a long time in war , the news cycle and the international debate over how to respond to terrorism , " he wrote			0
the judge also said the government failed to convince him a collective review of the photos met the requirements of the @entity66			0
the @entity16 argued the @entity2 must individually review each photo and explain why its release would put @entity12 in danger			1
@entity70 , @entity16 deputy legal director , said in a statement that the photos are " the best evidence of what took place in the military 's detention centers , and their disclosure would help the public better understand the implications of some of the @entity9 administration 's policies			2
" a response by the @entity2 to the judge 's decision was not immediately available			0
the @entity2 has refused to release the photos requested by the @entity16 , saying publication could endanger @entity12 soldiers and civilians overseas			1
several @entity12 military leaders who saw some of the pictures made that argument in a december 19 filing in the lawsuit			0
they pointed to public demonstrations in @entity35 countries that followed reports of @entity101 burnings , the release of the video " @entity103 " and the 2012 release of a video that showed @entity12 soldiers urinating on dead enemy combatants			2
navy rear adm. @entity108 of the @entity109 said @entity111 extremist groups like @entity112 use " imagery associated with @entity12 detention practices " as part of their recruiting efforts			0
the @entity16 responded by saying the military leaders did n't see all the photos , just a sampling selected by an army lawyer			0
the @entity16 also said the leaders did n't explain how the photos were " similarly inflammatory			0
" their prediction of anti-american violence was only speculation , the @entity16 said			0
" to allow the government to suppress any image that might provoke someone , somewhere , to violence would be to give the government sweeping power to suppress evidence of its own agents ' misconduct , " @entity70 of the @entity16 said .			0

the @entity16 sued the @entity2 in 2003 for photos of detainees in @entity6 and @entity7
government has said publication of the photos could endanger @entity12 soldiers and civilians overseas
