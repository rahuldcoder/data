computer hacking was once the realm of curious teenagers			1
it 's now the arena of government spies , professional thieves and soldiers of fortune			1
today , it 's all about the money			1
that 's why @entity13 hackers broke into @entity14 and stole the blueprints to the trillion - dollar f - 35 fighter jet			1
it 's also why @entity19 hackers have sneaked into @entity23 oil and gas companies for years			1
the stakes are higher , too			1
in 2010 , hackers slipped a " digital bomb " into the @entity26 that nearly sabotaged the stock market			1
in 2012 , @entity29 ruined 30,000 computers at @entity32 oil producer @entity31			1
and think of the immense ( and yet undisclosed ) damage from @entity35 's cyberattack on @entity36 last year			1
computers were destroyed , executives ' embarrassing emails were exposed , and the entire movie studio was thrown into chaos			1
it was n't always this way			1
@entity44 actually has some pretty innocent and harmless beginnings			1
the whole concept of " hacking " sprouted from the @entity48 nearly 50 years ago			1
computer science students there borrowed the term from a group of model train enthusiasts who " hacked " electric train tracks and switches in 1969 to improve performance			1
these new hackers were already figuring out how to alter computer software and hardware to speed it up , even as the scientists at @entity62 were developing @entity63 , one of the world 's first major operating systems			1
@entity67 became the art of figuring out unique solutions			1
it takes an insatiable curiosity about how things work ; hackers wanted to make technology work better , or differently			1
they were not inherently good or bad , just clever			1
in that sense , the first generation of true hackers were " phreakers , " a bunch of @entity82 punks who toyed with the nation 's telephone system			1
in 1971 , they discovered that if you whistle at a certain high - pitched tone , 2600 - hertz , you could access @entity62 's long - distance switching system			2
they would make international phone calls , just for the fun of it , to explore how the telephone network was set up			1
this was low - fi stuff			2
the most famous phreaker , @entity102 ( aka " @entity103 ) earned his nickname because he realized the toy whistle given away in cereal boxes emitted just the right tone			2
this trained engineer took that concept to the next level by building a custom " blue box " to make those free calls			1
this surreptitious little box was such a novel idea that young engineers @entity112 and @entity114 started building and selling it themselves			2
these are the guys who would later go on to start @entity118			2
wire fraud spiked , and the @entity120 cracked down on phreakers and their blue boxes			1
the laws did n't quite fit , though			2
kids were charged with making harassing phone calls and the like			2
but federal agents could n't halt this phenomenon			2
a tech - savvy , inquisitive and slightly anti-authoritarian community had been born			2
the next generation came in the early 1980s , as people bought personal computers for their homes and hooked them up to the telephone network			2
the @entity134 was n't yet alive , but computers could still talk to one another			2
this was the golden age of hacking			1
these curious kids tapped into whatever computer system they could find just to explore			2
some broke into computer networks at companies			2
others told printers at hospitals hundreds of miles away to just spit out paper			2
and the first digital hangouts came into being			2
hackers met on text - only bulletin board systems to talk about phreaking , share computer passwords and tips			1
the 1983 movie " @entity157 " depicted this very thing , only the implications were disastrous			2
in it , a teenager in @entity161 accidentally taps into a military computer and nearly brings the world to nuclear war			2
it 's no surprise , then , that the @entity120 was on high alert that year , and arrested six teenagers in @entity169 -- who called themselves the 414s , after their area code -- when they tapped into the @entity171 , a nuclear weapon research facility			1
@entity174 fears led the @entity175 to pass the @entity176 in 1986			2
breaking into computer systems was now a crime of its own			0
the damage of hacking started getting more serious , too			1
in 1988 , the government 's @entity183 , the earliest version of the @entity186 , got jammed when a @entity188 graduate student , curious about the network 's size , created a self - replicating software worm that multiplied too quickly			0
the next year , a few @entity193 hackers working for the @entity19 @entity194 were caught breaking into the @entity195			1
in 1990 , hacker @entity196 rigged a @entity200 radio station 's phone system to win a @entity201 , only to be arrested afterward			0
the cat - and - mouse game between law enforcement and hackers continued throughout the 1990s			1
@entity19 mathematician @entity206 was caught stealing $ 10 million from @entity207			0
others did it for revenge			0
@entity211 wiped the computers at @entity213 in @entity214 after he was fired			0
but hacks were still more of an annoyance than anything devastating , though it was quickly becoming apparent that the potential was there			0
the stock market , hospitals , credit card transactions -- everything was running on computers now			0
there was a bone - chilling moment when a ragtag group of hackers calling themselves @entity230 testified before @entity175 in 1998 and said they could shut down the internet in 30 minutes			1
the danger was suddenly more real than ever			0
the ethos was starting to change , too			0
previously , hackers broke into computers and networks because they were curious and those tools were inaccessible			1
the @entity134 changed that , putting all that stuff at everyone 's fingertips			0
money became the driving force behind hacks , said @entity245 , a member of @entity230 who is known internationally as the hacker " @entity247			0
" an unpatched bug in @entity249 could let a hacker enter a bank , or a foreign government office			0
mafias and governments were willing to pay top dollar for this entry point			0
a totally different kind of black market started to grow			0
the best proof came in 2003 , when @entity260 started offering a $ 5 million bounty on hackers attacking @entity249			1
" it 's no longer a quest for information and knowledge by exploring networks			0
it 's about dollars , " @entity245 said			0
" researchers are no longer motivated to get stuff fixed			0
now , they say , ' i 'm going to go looking for bugs to get a paycheck - and sell this bug to a government			0
' " loosely affiliated amateurs were replaced by well - paid , trained professionals			0
by the mid- 2000s , hacking belonged to organized crime , governments and hacktivists			1
first , crime : hackers around the world wrote malicious software ( malware ) to hijack tens of thousands of computers , using their processing power to generate spam			1
they wrote banking trojans to steal website login credentials			0
@entity44 payment systems turned out to be insanely lucrative , too			0
@entity296 's theft of 94 million credit cards from the company @entity298 in 2007 proved to be a precursor to later retailer data breaches , like @entity301 , @entity302 and many more			0
when the @entity82 wanted to sabotage the @entity29 nuclear program in 2009 , it hacked a development facility and unleashed the most dangerous computer virus the world has ever seen			1
@entity310 caused the @entity29 lab computers to spin centrifuges out of control			0
this was unprecedented : a digital strike with extreme physical consequences			0
similarly , there 's proof that @entity19 used hackers to coordinate its attack on @entity320 during a five - day war in 2008 , taking out key news and government websites as tanks rolled into those specific cities			1
the populist group @entity328 hacks into police departments to expose officer brutality and floods banks with garbage internet traffic			0
a vigilante known as " @entity334 " takes down @entity336 jihadist websites			0
what exists now is a tricky world			0
was it the @entity19 government or @entity19 nationalists acting on their own ? or freelance agents paid by the government ? in the digital realm , attribution is extremely difficult			0
meanwhile , it 's easier than ever to become a hacker			0
@entity349 weapons go for mere dollars on easily accessible black markets online			0
anonymity is a few clicks away with the right software			0
and there are high - paying jobs in defending companies like @entity357 or @entity358 -- or attacking them			0
as a result , law enforcement tolerance for hacking has fallen to zero			1
in 1999 , the hacker @entity247 exposed how @entity364 's website was leaking consumer email addresses and forced the company to fix it			0
when @entity368 ( known as " weev " ) did the same thing to @entity62 in 2010 , he spent more than a year in prison until his case was overturned on a technicality			0
the days of mere curiosity are over .			0

the concept of " hacking " began nearly 50 years ago at @entity48
in the ' 80s , hackers wanted to make technology work better
