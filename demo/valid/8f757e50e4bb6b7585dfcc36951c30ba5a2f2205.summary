cancers , according to a seven - year study published monday			0
@entity11 , as they are commonly referred , had a 43 % lower chance of getting the cancer compared to people with omnivorous diets			1
why focus on colorectal cancer ? it is the third most diagnosed cancer , and the third leading cause of cancer - related death in the @entity21 in 2014 , according to @entity23 statistics			1
the disease is particularly dangerous because it is usually asymptomatic in its early stages , making it more difficult to detect when it 's less deadly			0
only 59 % of those recommended for screenings receive procedures that are in line with the @entity23 's standards			0
the study , which followed nearly 78,000 people and was published in the @entity35 , adds to the growing body of evidence touting the health benefits of a plant - based diet			1
another study , reviewing data from 39 separate studies showing that a plant based diet leads to an average drop in blood pressure similar to 30 - 60 minutes of exercise per day			1
yet another study from last year found an average weight loss of nearly 7.5 pounds for vegetarians			2
while evidence shows the health benefits of reducing red meat consumption , the recent study highlights the differences between even a fully vegetarian diet and a pescetarian diet			2
within the sample group there was a 27 % drop in the risk of contracting colorectal cancer if you switch from fully vegetarian to eating fish			1
the authors of the study suggest that omega - 3 fatty acids may be the key to such a low risk of cancer in the pescetarian group			0
" in addition to other dietary factors , fish may provide added protection from its high content omega - 3 fatty acids			0
this is consistent with previous research that has found omega - 3s have anti-cancer activity and that they may be helpful in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer			2
" some questions can be raised though , from observing the recent study 's participants @entity88 , a group that typically avoids alcohol and tobacco			0
but despite the caveat , @entity72 is optimistic			0
" while the study is observational and can not prove a cause / effect relationship , it is exciting to think that in addition to regular screenings , a diet rich in fish and fiber - rich foods may play an important role in reducing the risk of colorectal cancer			1

a new study shows a 43 % lower risk of contracting colorectal cancer with a pesco - vegetarian diet
colorectal cancers are the third most diagnosed cancers in the @entity21
plant - based diets may also contribute to greater weight loss and lower blood pressure
