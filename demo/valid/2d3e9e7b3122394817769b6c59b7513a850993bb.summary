@entity2 calling state bans on same - sex marriage " incompatible with the @entity6 , " the @entity1 administration friday filed a brief at the @entity9 @entity8 in support of couples who are making challenges in @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			1
" the marriage bans challenged in these cases impermissibly exclude lesbian and gay couples from the rights , responsibilities and status of civil marriage , " solicitor general @entity17 wrote			1
he said the states have " burdened petitioners in every aspect of life that marriage touches , from the mundane to the profound			0
" the brief marks the first time the administration has formally made a filing with the high court supporting its position that bans on gay marriage should be declared unconstitutional nationwide			2
the court will hear arguments in the state cases on april 28			2
@entity17 said the laws " impose concrete harms on same - sex couples and send the inescapable message that same - sex couples and their children are second - class families , unworthy of the recognition and benefits that opposite - sex couples take for granted			1
" the bans , he said , " can not be reconciled with the fundamental constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws			0
" he said there is " no adequate justification for such a discriminatory and injurious exercise of state control			0
" @entity17 stressed that throughout history lesbian and gay people have encountered numerous barriers that have " prevented them from full , free , and equal participation in @entity9 life			0
" in an op - ed earlier this week , published in @entity66 , attorney general @entity65 wrote , " marriage equality is an idea whose time has come			2
" president @entity1 's position on same - sex marriage has evolved			1
in may 2012 , in an interview with @entity73 , he announced his support for gay marriage			0
" at a certain point , " he said , " i 've just concluded that for me , personally , it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that i think same - sex couples should be able to get married			1
" at his 2013 inauguration he said , " our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law			0
" in february 2013 , the administration filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of couples challenging @entity91 's ban on same sex marriage			1
@entity93 argued that @entity91 law provided same sex couples registered as domestic partners all the legal incidents of marriage , but denied them the " designation of marriage			2
" ultimately , the @entity8 dismissed that case			2
supporters of the state bans have until the end of the month to file their briefs			1
thursday was the deadline for briefs in support of petitioners			0
@entity111 , the named plaintiff in the case , came to the court friday as the @entity114 delivered a brief signed by over 200,000 individuals in support of same - sex marriage			1
in an interview , @entity111 said his journey began when he challenged @entity15 's refusal to recognize same - sex marriage on death certificates			1
he was legally married to his partner , @entity123 , in @entity124 in 2013 , but after @entity126 died , @entity15 officials refused to recognize @entity111 as his spouse			0
asked what it would mean to him if his side wins , @entity111 said , " it will mean @entity123 and i matter			0
it will mean we have the same rights and responsibilities as other @entity9			0
