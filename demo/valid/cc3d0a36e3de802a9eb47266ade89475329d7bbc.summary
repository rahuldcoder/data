@entity2 @entity1 president @entity0 said saturday an unspecified number of @entity5 were arrested " a few days ago " for engaging in espionage and recruitment activities			1
the president said they included an @entity11 pilot of @entity11 origin , arrested in the southwest border state of @entity14			0
he said the pilot was found in possession of " all kinds of documents " and was being interrogated by the authorities , though he did not identify him			0
the @entity1 government has made many similar claims in recent years , without ever substantiating them			2
@entity0 also announced saturday a series of measures , including visa requirements for @entity5 citizens and the downsizing of the @entity28 in @entity2 , to counteract what he called @entity5 " interference " in his country			1
@entity1 has in recent weeks accused the @entity5 of being behind an alleged coup plot			1
speaking at an " anti-imperialist " rally in the capital , @entity0 said visas would now be required for all @entity5 visitors and that the @entity5 @entity28 in @entity2 would now need foreign ministry approval for any meetings			1
the @entity28 , which he said had more than 100 staff , is to be reduced to a number closer to the 17 @entity1 diplomats based in @entity42			2
moreover , a group of prominent @entity5 officials , current and retired , will be banned from entering @entity1 because of what @entity0 said was their involvement in " bombing @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 " and other " terrorist " actions			1
the officials include @entity53 , former @entity5 vice president @entity54 , former cia director @entity55 and several current members of @entity57 , including @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60			1
following the @entity0 's announcement @entity60 reacted via @entity62 , saying he has " always wanted to travel to a corrupt country that is not a free democracy			0
and now @entity66 's lap dog wo n't let me ! " the move comes after the @entity5 government last month approved a law under which @entity1 officials allegedly involved in human rights violations are to have their visas revoked and their @entity5 assets frozen			2
a relatively small , but noisy crowd , dressed mostly in revolutionary red , applauded and cheered the measures announced by the president from a platform outside the presidential palace in downtown @entity2			0
four missionaries from @entity83 in @entity84 , @entity81 were released by @entity1 authorities on saturday , a church official said			1
pastor @entity86 said the missionaries arrived in @entity1 on february 20 and were detained a few days ago			1
" we love the @entity1 people and have served alongside them for over 12 years , " @entity86 said			0
" we have been praying along with hundreds or thousands of others for their release and for those in @entity1 who also have been affected by this			0
" it is unclear if the detention and release of these @entity5 is connected to @entity0 's charges of espionage			2
journalist @entity101 reported from @entity2			0
