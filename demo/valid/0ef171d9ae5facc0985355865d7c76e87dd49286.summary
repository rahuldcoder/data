@entity3 prime minister @entity2 's speech to the @entity4 this week was as eagerly anticipated in @entity5 as it was in @entity6			1
the @entity8 reaction to the speech has been a combination of indignation and indifference			0
while some of @entity2 's remarks are already being exploited by competing factions within the @entity8 state , the likeliest impact of the speech is tied to @entity2 's baseless charge that @entity8 's vendetta against the @entity22 people is an ancient mission			2
the earliest official reactions were predictably the most vigorous in denouncing @entity2 's message to the @entity27 people			2
@entity28 , the powerful speaker of the @entity8 parliament , painted @entity2 as the leader of a " tin pot regime " that is not as concerned about @entity8 's nuclear program as it is of @entity5 's growing regional influence			0
the hardline @entity36 newspaper , the key official outlet linked to the office of @entity8 's supreme leader , ayatollah @entity39 , called the speech " trash talking " but it also made sure to use it an ammunition against its rivals in the moderate faction			0
the paper , skeptical of president @entity48 's nuclear negotiations with the @entity27 from the beginning , said @entity2 's comments present an awkward truth for the pro-negotiation faction in @entity5 : the @entity3 leader and his @entity27 supporters are openly signaling the dispute with @entity8 can only be resolved once there is a change of regime there			1
@entity8 media coverage of @entity2 's speech mentioned the controversy in the @entity27 around its timing but the hardline outlets warned against reading too much into it			1
as one hardline newspaper , @entity69 , put it , " although it is undeniable that @entity72 and @entity2 disagree on @entity8 , the [ recent ] remarks of the two [ leaders ] shows that they both seek the same goal			2
" the idea that the @entity27 and @entity3 share the same strategic goal to rein in @entity8 but are in disagreement about how to achieve it is the cornerstone of the hardliners ' stance in @entity5			0
the moderate outlets , supportive of president @entity48 , have put a different spin on @entity2 's speech			1
unlike the hardliners , they are not painting the @entity72 - @entity2 fallout as some orchestrated good cop - bad cop ploy to maximize concessions from @entity5			0
instead , they emphasize that there is a genuine difference in opinion between the @entity27 and @entity3			0
the moderate faction sees the controversy around @entity2 's speech to the @entity4 and his failure to squeeze the @entity72 @entity95 to toughen its negotiation terms with @entity5 as an indication that @entity2 is the one who is isolated			1
the hardliners and the moderates were in full agreement on one point , and that was the delight they shared about the absence of some 60 out of 232 @entity105 members of the @entity4 from @entity2 's speech			1
it is too early to gain a good insight into the reaction of ordinary @entity8 to @entity2 's speech			1
but one aspect of his speech is bound to create backlash among ordinary @entity8 outside the corridors of the state : his invocation of festival of @entity118 , which commemorates the salvation of @entity22 people in ancient @entity8			0
the historic event is recorded in the @entity122 but @entity2 's characterization implied that the @entity126 people 's history of anti-semitism and the pursuit of agenda to destroy the @entity22 people is an ancient mission			0
" today the @entity22 people face another attempt by yet another @entity126 potentate to destroy us , " @entity2 said			0
with that line , he put the ruling @entity135 in @entity5 on par with ruling @entity126 empires that have come before them			0
as is already evident in the @entity126 - language social media , this will not go down well with ordinary @entity8 , many of whom are not supporters of the @entity145 system in @entity5 and will resent the charge of eternal @entity126 anti-semitism			0
they wish @entity2 had made more effort to distinguish between the @entity145 rulers in @entity5 -- many of whom undoubtedly harbor anti-semitic views -- and the people of @entity8 whose history with the @entity22 nation is far more amicable than @entity2 's portrayal of history suggests			2
what is more instantly measurable is the impact of @entity2 's speech among officials in @entity5			2
the @entity8 response to @entity2 's speech to the @entity4 is best described as one that reflects the clash of visions between moderates and hardliners in the echelons of power			1
for the moderates , the controversy around his speech and the cold - shoulder @entity2 got from the @entity95 is itself a vindication of president @entity48 's gamble on reaching a diplomatic solution to @entity8 's 12 - year nuclear saga			1
the hardliners have been quick to paint @entity2 's visit to @entity6 as an example of the insincerity of the @entity27 in dealing with @entity8 , but not even the hawks in @entity5 are claiming that @entity2 's presence in the @entity4 is grounds to shift @entity8 's nuclear diplomatic strategy .			1

@entity8 met @entity2 's speech with indignation , indifference , writes @entity188
moderates believe @entity72 's cold shoulder is vindication of @entity48 's strategy , he says
hardliners suggest the speech shows @entity27 insincerity but have not argued against talks
