every year , animal handlers travel throughout @entity2 and @entity3 to compete at agricultural shows			1
@entity12 's " @entity11 " is a documentation of those competitions , with photos that place a spotlight on the handlers and their animals			1
" when you go to ( the shows ) , they tend to be all about the animals -- people photographing the animals , " @entity12 said			1
" i just wanted to turn my attention onto the people because they 're so committed to what they do			0
they 're really devoted and hardworking			0
" while those involved with the competitions are the focus of many press photographers , @entity12 's work stands out for its distinctive portraiture style			1
" my work is a bit more composed			0
i use a medium - format camera and a tripod , so it is a bit more static in a way , " she said			0
" i think everybody is so proud of their animals that when i said to them that , ' i 'd love a portrait of you and your cow , ' everyone was more than willing to give up their time and help because they 're so passionate about what they do			2
" the " @entity11 " portraits lead viewers down a winding pathway to ponder those inexplicable yet noticeable connections and bonds that exist between the handlers and their animals			1
@entity12 's photos also contain subtle details			1
for example , the symbols and signs on the wall behind @entity61 and her @entity63 yearling heifer @entity64 are just as significant as the handler and her animal			0
" it 's just the way ( @entity61 ) had gone through the effort of decorating the pen ( with @entity72 ) where the cows were being kept , " @entity12 said			1
" there 's also a sign behind ( her ) ... and there 's a picture of a gentleman with a cow , who is actually her husband who had died a few years ago			0
... i just thought that was nice , something quite sentimental about that			0
" there are not only sentimental subtleties within " @entity11 , " but also fun and interesting ones as well			0
this is especially evident in the photo of the traditional @entity3 pigs being judged , as @entity12 points out there is an advertisement for sausages behind the pigs			1
regardless of what elements make up @entity12 's photos , the emotions and aesthetics remain particularly important			1
@entity12 said that when photographing @entity102 and his @entity104 cow , his happiness and smile made her want to " share that sense of enjoyment " that handlers have when competing with their animals in the shows			1
what drew @entity12 to @entity111 and her guinea pig @entity113 were the similar colors radiating from both of them			1
her photo of the pair won the @entity120 's @entity119 in 2011			0
" ( @entity111 ) was like a steward , she was sort of judging the guinea pigs			0
and she also had her own guinea pig with her , which had red as well , " @entity12 said			1
" i just thought that was incredibly striking			0
i thought , ' i 've got to get a shot of that			0
' " the dynamics of the competitions foster a community atmosphere in which everybody becomes acquainted with one another after having traveled to different shows for so many years			2
@entity12 said this was an enjoyable aspect of her work because " you get to see lots of familiar faces			1
" social media follow @ @entity141 on @entity142 to join the conversation about photography			2
she has learned about the pride the handlers have toward their animals , and many of her presumptions about the competitions have now changed after having worked on " @entity11			2
" " i think when i first started going , i was sort of thinking the shows would be more novelty , fun things for these people , " she said			2
" but , actually , it is n't really ; it 's quite a serious thing , because they can make money from breeding			0
" in addition to handlers earning significant money from breeding , they are also able to achieve recognition for their livestock			2
those competing have a lot at stake when they make the decision to travel and compete , because the shows are just as much business events as they are social gatherings			1
the competitions are also rather family - oriented , and @entity12 said that while adults compete , their sons , daughters and grandchildren are involved as well			2
the younger generations are likely to one day take over the responsibility of running the family farms , and everyone that participates seems to have a strong sense of pride and passion for agriculture			0
" i think it 's something i will always document for the rest of my life , and see how things change , " @entity12 said			2
" it was challenging , insightful and fun			0
" @entity12 is a @entity194 photographer based in @entity195			1
you can follow her on @entity198 .			0
