for those who hoped that the coming presidential election would usher in the dawn of a new , more inspiring politics , this past week has been deeply discouraging			1
in two key moments , leaders from both sides of the aisle have acted like the @entity9 of @entity10 , who famously remembered nothing and forgot nothing from battles of their past			2
the first and substantively more important moment was the sending of that letter by @entity20 senators to the @entity22 regime			1
the second , and perhaps more important politically telling moment , was @entity25 's handling of her emails			1
the two cases are oddly related			2
in both instances , the principals started with legitimate concerns but have wound up making things worse			2
in both cases , the principals have also created divisive issues that will deepen polarization through the campaign and probably into the next presidency			1
both have diminished the chances for breaking out of today 's ugly politics			1
@entity20 in @entity41 have reason to press hard with their views as negotiations with @entity22 enter the home stretch			1
they , like many others -- including a sizable number of @entity48 , the current @entity50 government , and friendly @entity52 nations -- fear the @entity54 administration will cut a weak , leaky deal that will allow @entity22 to come perilously close to having nuclear weapons			1
just as importantly , @entity20 believe , with cause , that as he negotiates , president @entity54 has tried to sideline @entity41 in general and them in particular			2
who can blame them for arguing that if the president insists any agreement needs only executive approval -- not approval by @entity41 -- then the next chief executive should not be legally bound by its provisions ? their basic concerns were not unreasonable			2
thus , if they had sent exactly the same letter to the president , they would have caused a stir but would have been seen as within the norms of politics and statecraft			2
instead , they made the mistake -- a wicked one -- of sending it to the terrorist leaders of @entity22 , leaving a clear impression they were out to sabotage both the deal and the president			1
we have had renegade members of @entity41 try to interfere with presidential negotiations in the past -- remember sen. @entity85 ? -- but never 47 members of the @entity87 tossing a hand grenade into delicate , life - or - death negotiations conducted by seven major nations and led by the @entity91			2
@entity92 made clear this week that he may use the @entity20 letter as a pretext for rejecting any deal			2
where do we go then ? will talks collapse ? will an @entity22 rush toward the bomb set off a nuclear arms race , starting in @entity101 , which is already taking preliminary steps ? will the @entity91 then be compelled to use military force against @entity22 ? who knows for sure ? what we do know is that @entity22 is now almost certain to become a central issue in the 2016 presidential campaign and that the @entity20 nominee will be under relentless pressure from the right to adopt a hard , unyielding line			1
one can just imagine a number of @entity20 candidates pledging that if elected , they will abolish @entity116 on day 1 and an @entity22 agreement on day 2			1
this is hardly a way to restore steady , bipartisan foreign policies , as we so badly need			2
and why have @entity20 forgotten so soon the damage done from voters thinking the last @entity20 president was too hard line and reckless ? on the other side of the aisle , @entity25 had absolutely legitimate concerns about the security of emails she might send as secretary of state			2
as one who spent a year and a half at the @entity134 and @entity135 , i could see first hand how they -- more than any president since @entity138 -- were hounded by enemies and reporters trying to ferret out secrets to cause trouble or win a prize			0
it is small wonder that both @entity146 still have scar tissue			0
@entity25 's mistakes did not start with creating an email protection system			1
no , they started when she and her team failed to coordinate up front with the @entity135 system and record all official exchanges within the government system on a prompt , air - tight basis			1
that did not break laws			0
but it did run afoul of government procedures and , when revealed , naturally gave rise to suspicions about what she might be hiding			0
in her press conference , she did accomplish her obvious mission : she began cutting legs off the story			0
in essence , she said one half of her emails ( the official ones ) are now safely with the @entity135 and , at her request , will gradually be made public			0
the other half ( who knows what 's in there ? ) have been deleted and she is keeping the server			1
in effect , she says , they are gone ... and gone forever , beyond @entity41 subpoena , @entity184 requests , and even hackers			0
what fresh revelations can the press now pursue ? not many			0
and how can @entity20 browbeat her in hearings without looking like bullies ? hard to do			0
in short , the story may soon die			0
you just have to trust me , she says			0
but the very fact that instead of inviting a neutral , trusted party like @entity198 to review all the emails , she chose to cut off the story by destroying the evidence comes with a price : she has freshly renewed public doubts whether she plays straight or by her own rules			0
loyal @entity48 will continue to invest their faith in her , but for many others , the controversy leaves a lingering sense of unease			0
she was always going to face a rough campaign , but now she will begin with clouds already gathering			1
more to the point , they will obscure her very real strengths as a leader			0
around the world , many women look upon her with heartfelt admiration from her years of promoting their empowerment			0
and she has also has a strong case to make that she and her husband know something about job creation : 22.9 million were created in the eight @entity228 years , more than in any other presidency since @entity230 ( @entity231 was second at 16.1 million ; there have been some 6.4 million in the first six @entity54 years			1
in short , she is worse off than she was before this controversy broke -- and so are @entity91 politics			0
@entity228 likes to say that politics is always about tomorrow -- and he is right			1
but candidates also need to remember and learn from yesterday			0
after this last week , they might start by reading a wonderful book by historian @entity238 published some 30 years ago : " @entity239 : from @entity240 to @entity241			1
" there she argues that leaders often start out trying to do the right thing but take a wrong path , stubbornly stick with it despite all evidence and eventually wreck			1
@entity238 calls their refusal to learn from experience " wooden - headedness "			0
we have seen too much wooden - headedness these past days .			0
