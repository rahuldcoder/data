@entity1 , @entity2 in the @entity4 on the outskirts of @entity1 , a petite , blonde woman opens the front door			1
dressed in skinny jeans , a gray t - shirt and black heels , @entity8 welcomes us inside her family home			1
her warm smile and sparkly green eyes briefly disguise the deep - seated grief and sadness that constantly envelops her			1
the mother of two young boys ca n't move on			1
her life is stuck on march 7 , 2014 , when she kissed her husband @entity23 goodbye at @entity24			1
he was heading to @entity25 , where he would begin work as a mechanical engineer at one of the mines			1
it was a big job with enormous opportunity that could set up his young family			1
unable to wear jewelry at the work site , he gave @entity8 his wedding band saying that if anything was to happen to him , she should give the ring to the first son that marries			1
wearing it on a simple chain around her neck , she touches it as she speaks			1
" i 'm so glad that happened , that i 've got this for the boys , " she said			1
" and for me , because i may never get anything			1
it may be the only piece of him that i have that is so close to us			2
" @entity55 , 39 , left @entity1 that day and flew to @entity56 , @entity57 , for his flight on to @entity59			1
just after midnight on march 8 , he boarded @entity60			1
weeks had no idea about the plane 's disappearance until she got a call from a news reporter asking if her husband was on board the missing @entity70			1
" my life stopped that day , so that 's what i remember			2
i 'm purely now just existing			2
people say you 're coping			2
i would n't call it coping ; it 's existing			2
" she has yet to tell her eldest son @entity77 , 4 , that his father whom he adored will never come home			2
she ca n't make sense of it herself			2
how is a 4 - year - old going to understand ? she tells him @entity83 is working in @entity25 -- the truth is just too painful			1
" you create your own scenarios in your head and you ca n't bear to think that someone -- your best friend , amazing husband , the father of my children -- went through any of that			1
i do n't want that for him			2
it 's the not knowing that really destroys you			2
" the past 12 months have been a roller coaster of emotions for @entity61			2
initially she thought the plane had crashed but when no debris appeared she clung on to hope			2
when the " pings " were discovered and authorities believed they would find the black boxes within days , she was told to prepare for her husband 's memorial service			1
when that turned out to be wrong , her heart sank once again			2
now there are days when her grief paralyzes her and she ca n't get out of bed			2
there are other days when she affords herself the small luxury of daydreaming and imagines him walking in the front door			0
" when i 'm alone and i think ' what if he comes back ? ' i see our wedding pictures and i think if he was to come back it would be amazing ( for me ) and for the kids			1
@entity125 has grown so much -- he was 11 months when @entity23 left			1
we 're coming up to his second birthday			0
" we 've gone through all the 12 months of special days and i look at @entity125 and he 's the spitting image of @entity23			0
he would be blown away by how much he 's grown			0
he should be here seeing all of that and the reason we do n't know why is so painful			0
" i ca n't even explain the pain -- it 's unbearable			0
" we discuss the current search underway in the southern @entity135 more than 1,000 miles from where we are sitting in her home			0
@entity55 looks deflated -- she 's physically , mentally and emotionally exhausted			1
" they 're very optimistic about this latest search			0
i ca n't share in that anymore			0
i 've thrown my emotions and hopes into so many other searches			0
it 's too much for me now			0
i wo n't come back			0
half of my soul was on that plane with @entity23 and now nearly a year on ... i do n't think i will ever find myself again			0
" @entity61 's eyes well up with tears as she talks about her husband whom she met at the @entity151 15 years ago			1
since then , they had been inseparable -- until now			0
her greatest fear is if nothing is found in the 60,000 square kilometer priority search area -- due to be completed by may - the authorities will call off the search operation			0
no country has said this but it does n't stop @entity8 from thinking it			1
" you know , that 's so unfair -- where does that leave us ? we ca n't move on beyond @entity60			1
they may be able to but they do n't come home to an empty house and 2 young children that should have their father here			1
they ( the @entity57 ) are legally and morally committed to bringing them all home and that 's what they should do "			0
when asked what she 'll be doing on march 8 -- one year since @entity60 disappeared and since she last saw @entity23 -- tears stream down her face			1
" probably crying a lot			0
i never thought we 'd reach a year and not know			0
you go through every anniversary , @entity77 's birthday , @entity23 's birthday , @entity187			0
you think we 'll know by then and it 's a year on			0
" while her loss and pain is palpable , there is an incredible strength within weeks			0
she has to remain strong , she says , for the sake of her boys			0
" i will keep searching			0
i will never stop searching for him			0
he gave everything to us			1
i know that if the shoe was on the other foot , he would n't stop looking for me			0
" and i will never stop looking for him either			0
