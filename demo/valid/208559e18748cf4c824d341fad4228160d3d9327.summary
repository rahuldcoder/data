@entity0 @entity2 is back in his favorite place : the spotlight			1
as the first candidate to quit the charade of " exploring " a presidential run and actually jumping in , the @entity7 @entity6 senator presented an image monday of decisiveness and vision -- all before an auditorium of mostly supportive young evangelicals			0
now comes the hard part			0
@entity2 must make inroads with wide swaths of the @entity6 if he hopes to break through as a top - tier candidate			1
he does n't have many friends in the party establishment thanks to his hard - line tactics on issues like @entity25			2
and he 's facing steep competition for the conservative vote from the likes of @entity30 gov. @entity29			2
even evangelicals , @entity2 's target audience during his launch speech at @entity33 , are n't firmly in his column			1
the firebrand 's decision to jump - start the 2016 election season now is an implicit admission of the daunting challenges he will face in a crowded @entity6 field where multiple @entity6 will vie for the same social and evangelical support base			1
" @entity2 is clearly a player , " said @entity44 , president of the @entity45 , a @entity46 public policy ministry			1
" but the competition this cycle is very steep			0
" by choosing @entity33 in @entity49 , which was founded by fundamentalist preacher @entity50 , to roll out his long shot campaign , @entity2 made clear he wo n't cede the @entity46 right to another candidate			1
" from the dawn of this country , at every stage , @entity57 has enjoyed @entity62 's providential blessing , " said @entity2 , roaming the stage with a microphone like a megachurch preacher on a sunday morning			1
" over and over again , when we faced impossible odds , the @entity57 people rose to the challenge			0
you know , compared to that , repealing @entity25 and abolishing the @entity69 ai n't all that tough			0
" @entity33 offered @entity2 a ready - made crowd : young evangelicals in a vast auditorium who had little choice but to pack the stands , because the announcement came during their compulsory weekly convocation			1
this is exactly the kind of coalition of youthful @entity46 idealists @entity2 must win over and get to work in early voting states if his presidential hopes are to catch fire			1
but @entity2 wo n't have this political territory all to himself			1
several students sat in the audience within view of the cameras wearing red t - shirts emblazoned with " @entity91 , " referring to @entity93 sen. @entity92 , who is also likely to make a play for young conservatives			2
meanwhile , @entity29 , with his governing record and history of facing down a recall and trade unions , seems to have eclipsed @entity2 in the minds of many conservatives who are desperate to take back the @entity102			1
" when the grass roots look at a guy like @entity29 -- he can not only bridge the divide , we believe , in the @entity6 , but he might be the one who can bridge the divide like he did in @entity30 , " said @entity103 , a @entity105 tea party activist			0
" that 's what i think is dominating @entity2 -- he has not made as many headlines as in 2013 , as when he tried to stop and defund @entity25			1
" @entity2 must also face off against @entity92 , former @entity116 gov. @entity115 , former @entity105 sen. @entity117 and dr. @entity118 to win evangelicals -- a tough task			1
" it 's a crowded field to begin with and it 's almost as if , within the @entity6 contest , there are some early sub-primaries : who is going to be the establishment candidate ? who is going to be the social conservative candidate ? " said @entity127 , who was for years the dean of @entity130 caucus reporters from his perch at the @entity132			2
meanwhile , a @entity1 / @entity135 last week put @entity2 as the choice of 4 % of likely @entity6 voters			1
so if he seems unlikely to win , why would @entity2 get in -- and so early ? paradoxically , the size of the task facing @entity2 and the tempered expectations for his bid may also mean that the risks that often weigh against a presidential candidacy -- the potential damage to a political career that can be caused by a poorly run campaign -- may not apply			1
@entity44 said he had been assured by @entity147 personally that he believes he can create a path to the nomination -- and ultimately the presidency -- despite the fact that he would be taking aim at the @entity102 with the almost unanimous disapproval of the @entity6 establishment			0
announcing now could give @entity2 more time to test messages beyond those tailored for evangelicals			2
he used his speech monday to also slam @entity160 education standards and immigration reform , areas where establishment @entity6 favorite @entity163 is perceived to be vulnerable			0
he also joined the hawkish @entity6 barrage on foreign policy , slamming president @entity167 over his row with @entity170 prime minister @entity169 and his record on @entity172 and combating " radical @entity174 terrorism			0
" but should he fall short in his 2016 bid , a successful campaign that positions @entity2 as the leader of the evangelical right would certainly boost his political brand and position him for a future presidential run			1
and at only age 44 , there 's plenty of time for that			2
his @entity187 seat , meanwhile , seems to be his as long as he wants it			0
he does n't have to run for re-election until 2018 , so a presidential bid would n't get in the way of the day job			0
so in a sense , @entity2 may not have that much to lose			2
another reason to get in early is @entity130			0
the state is going to be crucial for @entity2 's hopes because it is the most fertile early voting territory for his chosen campaign path			1
a win in the first - in - the - nation caucus could crown @entity2 as the undisputed champion of the social and evangelical conservative wing of the party			1
but he is going to be facing proven @entity130 campaigners			0
@entity115 won the state in 2008 and @entity117 won a recount over the eventual @entity6 nominee , @entity207 , in 2012			0
both have substantial networks of support and , crucially , know many caucus voters personally in a state where the personal touch counts for everything			0
" i think @entity2 has generated some excitement in @entity130 , and he is a new face , " said @entity215			2
" but it is going to be a while before he closes the sale with a lot of activists			0
" an added bonus for @entity2 getting in now : the early bird gets the best coverage			2
in a matter of weeks , @entity6 presidential announcements from the massive @entity6 field will draw little more than a shrug , so getting out ahead of expected announcements from @entity92 and @entity232 sen. @entity231 could be a good idea			0
when @entity236 @entity235 makes her official plunge into the 2016 race , any @entity6 candidate may struggle to dominate media coverage for several weeks			0
monday also happened to be the fifth anniversary of the day @entity25 was signed into law			0
because @entity2 has spent endless hours trying to overturn it -- winning the appreciation of conservative activists in the process -- monday was a good moment to highlight the point			2
@entity2 , unlike some other potential @entity6 candidates , may have to work extra hard to raise the campaign funds he needs to mount a viable campaign			1
his early announcement gives him time for a post-announcement spurt before the next quarterly fundraising figures close at the end of the month , and a full three months to put up an impressive number in the next quarter .			0

@entity2 's decision to jump - start the 2016 election season is an implicit admission of the challenges he faces
