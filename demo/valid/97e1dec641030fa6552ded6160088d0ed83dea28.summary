is @entity1 still alive ? the answer to this particular cosmic cliff - hanger was left unresolved towards the end of last year			1
the tiny space probe bounced across the surface of @entity7 before touching down away from its intended landing zone			2
it returned plenty of data from the surface but ended up in a shady spot where there was n't enough sunlight to keep it powered -- so then it went to sleep and nothing has been heard since november			0
in the months since , mission scientists have not been able to pinpoint its exact resting place			0
but now the comet - chasing mother ship @entity23 -- in orbit around @entity25 -- is to begin listening for signs that the lander has survived the cold and dark			1
scientists at the @entity29 ( @entity29 ) , which is leading a consortium that includes @entity31 to find out more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the @entity35 , believe that if enough sunlight falls on @entity1 's solar panels it could revive			2
as the comet gets closer to the @entity35 and more light illuminates the lander , the chances improve			2
lander system engineer @entity42 told @entity0 that @entity1 needs 5.5 watts of power to reboot itself , nine watts to switch on the receiver to accept communications and 19 watts to activate its transmitter and allow two - way communication with the orbiter			1
modern energy - saving domestic light bulbs consume 20 watts or lower so it does n't need much to re-establish contact			0
on tuesday , @ @entity54 tweeted : " excited ! i have some opportunities to listen for @ philae2014 to find out if he 's awake ! " @entity23 and @entity1 's love affair on @entity58 on the @entity23 mission blog , lander project manager @entity59 says : " it will probably still be too cold for the lander to wake up , but it is worth trying			1
the prospects will improve with each passing day			0
" the mission website adds that @entity1 could already have woken up but does not yet have sufficient power to communicate with @entity23			1
it says @entity23 will transmit to @entity1 between march 12 and march 20 , listening for a response			1
problems began for the lander when devices designed to anchor @entity1 to the surface failed			1
the gravity is so weak that without the harpoons intended to fire from the feet , the probe bounced across the comet			0
however , the mishap could prove to be a happy accident			0
@entity42 explained that as the comet nears the @entity35 , @entity1 's original landing spot would have exposed it to temperatures that would have burned out its electronics			1
in that position it most likely would have died by now			0
from lander pictures , mission controllers think @entity1 , which is about the size of a washing machine , is tucked up underneath a cliff face , affording it some shade			1
beginning thursday , mission controllers will send what @entity42 described as " blind commands " to @entity1 in the hope that the lander has enough power to receive instructions even if it ca n't respond			1
@entity1 will be told to save power for the transmitter			2
@entity42 admits that it 's a " long shot " but the team will try again in april if this attempt fails			0
if @entity1 revives it could be witness to an amazing show as the comet makes its closest approach to the @entity35 in august			1
" i think we are going to see some amazing images at that point , " said @entity42			0
even if @entity1 never wakes up , all is not lost			2
the mission has detected organic chemicals on the comet surface , though full details of that discovery have yet to be revealed			1
and the @entity23 mission is already changing perceptions of comets			2
@entity42 says instead of a comet being a dirty snowball he now thinks of it as being " an icy dirtball			0
" he described discoveries of dust and large " boulders " circling the comet after they were blown off by the @entity35 during previous orbits , and an image that appears to show a structure the size of a football pitch that has been lifted and then deposited next to the hole			0
" the @entity23 mission is not just about the lander			1
it 's about orbiting and following a comet -- watching it wake up and then go to sleep again , finding the secrets held by comets			0
every day is a new discovery , " he said			0
scientists have already applauded the mission 's success to date			0
" the @entity23 radar experiment will reveal for the first time how a comet is put together , " cosmochemist @entity145 told @entity0 in november			2
@entity0 : @entity23 and its mission opinion : how comet mission helps search for alien life			1

@entity23 is to begin listening for signs that the lander has survived the cold and dark
