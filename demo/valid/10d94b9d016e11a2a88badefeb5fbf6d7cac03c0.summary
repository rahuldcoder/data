@entity1 defender @entity0 and @entity4 striker @entity3 have been charged by the @entity5 for allegedly spitting during an altercation in wednesday night 's @entity8 game at @entity9			1
in a statement , @entity12 football 's governing body said the players had been charged " in relation to an alleged breach of @entity17 [ a ] in that in or around the 38th minute of the game the two players spat at each other			1
" the incidents were not seen by the match officials but [ were ] caught on video			2
" the players have until 6pm gmt on friday to respond to the charge , and could face six - game bans if found guilty			1
both @entity0 and @entity3 released statements the day after the incident , with @entity0 saying : " i would like to make it clear that i did not spit at @entity3			1
" @entity3 's statement said : " i reacted to something i found very unpleasant			1
sometimes it is hard not to react , particularly in the heat of the moment			0
i have always tried hard to be positive a role model , especially for our young fans , and yesterday i let you down			0
" spitting at another player is considered beyond the pale by professional footballers , and former @entity43 midfielder @entity42 , now a tv pundit , told the @entity45 's @entity47 programme the incident had been " disgusting			2
" " this is not acceptable , " he said			0
" there are kids watching			0
something has to be done			0
the behaviour towards each other and the referee is deteriorating on a weekly basis			0
" ex-manchester @entity4 midfielder @entity57 said he did not believe @entity0 had deliberately spat at @entity3 , telling @entity58 : " look , it 's not very nice			1
i think @entity0 is spitting on the floor			2
" i know @entity0 -- he 's not that type of person			2
if he wants to do that then it 's not hard to miss , is it ? he 's only stood a yard away from him			0
what @entity3 does afterwards is unforgivable			2
" and former @entity43 player @entity68 told the channel : " @entity3 stands up and spits right at @entity0 ' neck from about six inches			1
" two wrongs do not make a right			0
if @entity0 has spat at him then it 's wrong , but for @entity3 to get up and react like that is absolutely disgusting			1
