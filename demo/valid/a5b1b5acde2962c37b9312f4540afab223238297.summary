@entity1 's next prime minister -- whether incumbent @entity3 or @entity5 leader @entity4 -- will be faced with a myriad of international and domestic crises amid deepening tensions with the @entity9 , its closest ally			1
here are five key issues waiting in the new leader 's inbox after tuesday 's election			1
repairing relations with the @entity9 there are any number of irritants -- from settlement construction to failed peace talks to @entity1 military action in @entity22 and @entity23 -- which have long tested the alliance between @entity25 and @entity1			0
but ties have grown increasingly strained between president @entity27 and @entity3 , playing out over the last several years in a series of awkward photo - ops , anonymous quotes in @entity9 and @entity1 media and tense body language			1
relations hit a low point recently with @entity3 's speech to @entity36 criticizing president @entity27 's policy toward @entity39 about its nuclear program			1
repairing ties with the @entity42 becomes easier if the next government is formed under @entity4 , who has pledged to " restore intimacy and trust " with the leadership in @entity25			1
repairing ties becomes more difficult if @entity3 remains in office			1
for all its official praise for the " unshakable bonds " between the @entity9 and @entity1 , the @entity42 sees @entity3 as the problem			1
if @entity3 is re-elected , they will have to work with him			1
personal relations may be fraught now , but @entity27 has never suggested watering down or delaying mostly military @entity9 aid to @entity1 , which amounts to $ 3 billion a year			0
privately , however , @entity9 officials have warned the level of @entity25 's political support for @entity1 with allies and at the @entity59 could be affected by @entity3 's attitude toward the @entity27 administration			1
confronting @entity39 world powers are pushing toward a framework nuclear deal with @entity39 before the march 31 deadline			1
the next prime minister will take office shortly before a july deadline for a final deal and will need to reach key understandings with @entity25 on what security and diplomatic guarantees the @entity9 will provide @entity1 if the deal goes forward			0
in addition , @entity1 will want input on what constitutes a violation of the deal and what would trigger punitive measures if @entity39 reneges			1
if he remains in office , @entity3 's differing perceptions of the threat posed by @entity39 will undoubtedly come to a head as that deadline approaches			1
@entity3 has been clear he believes history has handed him the role of delivering the jewish state from an existential threat posed by @entity90 's nuclear ambitions			1
he worries that the agreement that emerges will leave @entity39 as a nuclear " threshold state " with the materials and expertise to quickly break out and build a nuclear weapon			1
@entity4 has similarly said he would never accept a nuclear @entity39 and stresses all options are on the table , including the military options			1
but he has suggested as prime minister he would work closer with the @entity27 administration and other governments negotiating with @entity39 to strengthen a deal , rather than try and block the deal through the @entity36			1
beyond the nuclear deal , the next @entity1 will leader will face an increasingly emboldened @entity39 in the region			1
beyond it 's longstanding support to @entity109 in @entity23 and backing of the @entity112 government in @entity113 , @entity39 has extended its involvement in @entity116 's battle against @entity117 and has provided support to @entity119 in @entity120			1
@entity1 officials say @entity39 is actively working to open up a front against @entity1 in the @entity1 - occupied @entity123			2
@entity39 said in january an @entity39 general had been killed in an @entity1 airstrike in the area			2
solving problems with @entity128 the breakdown last april of peace talks led by secretary of state @entity131 led the @entity128 to take unilateral steps in international forums such as the @entity59 and the @entity134			2
in response , @entity1 has halted delivering tax revenues , which it collects on the @entity128 ' behalf , seriously squeezing their economy			2
now the @entity128 are threatening to halt security cooperation with @entity1			2
coupled with a lack of a viable peace process and a potential economic collapse of the @entity128 authority , the lack of security coordination would present a total breakdown of cooperation between the two sides			1
the next @entity1 leader will need to stop this free fall before this dangerous cocktail of instability leads to further chaos and perhaps a third intifada			0
the differences between @entity3 and @entity4 seem to be more style than substance			1
during the campaign , @entity3 has hedged on his longstanding support for a two - state solution , but has not abandoned the idea entirely			2
@entity4 has pledged to restart the peace process , but has expressed skepticism about whether @entity128 president @entity164 is a reliable partner			1
the new prime minister must also deal with an ever worsening humanitarian situation in @entity22 , where rebuilding has been slow after last summer 's @entity168			0
@entity169 has basically cut off the border , further squeezing the strip			0
while there has been little violence since last year 's war , @entity172 has not been demilitarized and another round of fighting could be just another matter of time			0
although @entity172 belongs to a unity government with @entity164 ' @entity182 party , @entity164 continues to exercise little influence over the group			0
addressing growing social inequality while @entity1 voters traditionally cite security issues as a driving factor , the high cost of living has emerged as a major focus in this election season			0
@entity193 - high housing prices are of particular concern			0
last month , @entity1 's state comptroller issued a report finding housing prices in the country rose by 55 % between 2008 and 2014			0
rising food prices are another key issue			0
in july 2011 , @entity1 saw a massive wave of social protests centering on the expensive housing market and food prices			0
dubbed the " cottage cheese " protests -- because of the rising cost of cottage cheese , a staple in many @entity1 pantry -- they were emblematic of a broader concern that @entity3 's relentless focus on security issues was at the expense of domestic issues			1
polls indicate the growing frustration with the economy has resulted in a shift from @entity3 to @entity4			1
@entity4 has pledged to spend 7 billion shekels ( about $ 1.75 billion @entity9 ) on affordable housing , health care and other social programs for the middle class , which he called the " sandwich generation			2
" for the most part , @entity3 has not addressed the economy in his few campaign events , focusing more on his strong security credentials			2
in recent days , he pointed to a 5 % decrease in food prices and an increase in affordable housing during his tenure , but acknowledged that the rising costs of living and housing prices were not " fully addressed " by his government and promised to make the economy a top priority if re-elected			0
reversing @entity1 's isolation on the world stage @entity1 's next prime minister will need to repair @entity1 's increasingly frayed ties with once - friendly countries and its deepening worldwide isolation			0
leading opposition candidate @entity242 , who once served as @entity3 's main peace negotiator , accused @entity3 of being responsible for a " diplomatic tsunami " against @entity1			2
indeed , @entity3 's aggressive style has been cited as a major factor in strained ties with the @entity9 and @entity248 -- a perception caught in a hot - mic conversation between president @entity27 and @entity253 president @entity252 in 2011 , in which @entity252 lamented he could n't " bear " @entity3 , calling him a " liar			2
" @entity27 replied , " you 're fed up with him , but i have to deal with him even more often than you			0
" regardless of who is @entity1 's next leader , @entity1 faces growing worldwide frustration over its policies towards the @entity128 , particularly settlement construction			2
the @entity262 , @entity1 's largest trading partner , is in the process of canceling tax exemptions on @entity1 products made in settlements in the occupied @entity268 and is considering plans to label the origin of other products made in settlements			0
@entity273 , the @entity262 's new foreign policy chief , is seeking a greater role in helping to mediate the @entity1 - @entity128 conflict			0
in the absence of a viable peace process , several @entity248 nations have already recognized a @entity128 state , with several more promising to consider such a move			0
this makes @entity1 ever more dependent on @entity9 diplomatic support , including its veto at the @entity59			0
@entity25 has traditionally defended @entity1 against @entity128 efforts to achieve recognition at the @entity59 and legal action at the @entity134			0
and it has lobbied its @entity248 allies against sanctions on @entity1 exports			0
as with the @entity9 , it would seem easier to repair these frayed ties under a @entity4 - led government			0
if re-elected , @entity3 will have his work cut out for him			0
