@entity7 the discovery of the remains of @entity2 beneath a car parking lot in the @entity5 city of @entity6 in 2012 sparked excitement around the world			1
now those bones are to be reburied following a series of commemorations full of the pomp and circumstance befitting of a royal farewell			0
in the years since it was exhumed , the @entity18 's skeleton has given up plenty of secrets -- and research continues to find out more			1
say the name @entity2 to most people , and the image that will spring to mind is of @entity28 's villain , a cruel , conniving figure whose nasty character is reflected in his physical abnormalities , a " poisonous bunch - backed toad			2
" history , they say , is written by the victors , and according to the @entity36 and their most famous playwright , @entity2 was hunchbacked , with a withered hand and limping gait , " deformed , unfinished ... and that so lamely and unfashionable that dogs bark at me as i halt by them			2
" for the archaeologists searching for @entity2 's remains , the sight of the freshly - uncovered skeleton 's twisted spine was the moment the hairs began to stand up on the back of their necks ; tests later revealed the @entity18 suffered from idiopathic adolescent - onset scoliosis			1
but while the skeleton 's curved vertebrae are striking , experts say the resulting disability would not have been obvious in @entity2 when he was alive			1
it would have meant his right shoulder was slightly higher than the other , but this was likely disguised by clothing , and so only apparent to the @entity18 's closest family and confidantes			0

genetic specialist @entity18 , from the @entity73 , said analysis of various genetic markers offered clues to the @entity18 's appearance , suggesting he was actually fair haired and had blue eyes			0
" [ there are ] genes that we know are involved in coding for hair and eye color , " she told @entity8 in december 2014			0
" the genetic evidence shows he had a 96 % probability of having blue eyes , and a 77 % probability of having blond hair , though this can darken with age			0
" this would mean that the painting of @entity2 held by the @entity94 is the closest approximation we have to his real appearance : it shows him with grey - blue eyes and lighter brown hair than other portraits			2

scientists at the @entity119 measured the levels of isotopes including oxygen , strontium , nitrogen and carbon in @entity2 's remains , revealing clues to what he ate and drank			1
they spotted a dramatic change in the last few years of his life -- suggesting his dietary habits became markedly richer once he became @entity18			0
" obviously , @entity2 was a nobleman beforehand , and so his diet would be reasonably rich already , " explained isotope geochemist @entity136 , who led the study			2
" but once he became king we would expect him to be wining and dining more , banqueting more			0
" we have the menu from his coronation banquet and it was very elaborate -- lots of wildfowl , including real ' delicacies ' such as peacock and swan , and fish -- carp , pike and so on			0

researchers examining soil samples from the pelvis and skull of the skeleton spotted roundworm eggs in the area where the dead monarch 's intestines would have been			2
roundworm eggs -- in this case @entity171 -- are ingested via contaminated food , water or soil ; once hatched and matured , the worms can grow up to a foot long			0
" despite @entity2 's noble background , it appears that his lifestyle did not completely protect him from intestinal parasite infection , which would have been very common at the time , " said dr @entity178 , from the @entity73 , who exhumed the @entity18 's remains			1
" we would expect nobles of this period to have eaten meats such as beef , pork and fish regularly , but there was no evidence for the eggs of the beef , pork or fish tapeworm , " said dr @entity185 of the @entity159 , adding that the lack of tapeworms suggested the food @entity2 ate was thoroughly cooked			2

in his " @entity207 , " the @entity206 @entity205 , recorded that : " @entity2 alone was killed fighting manfully in the thickest press of his enemies			0
" when archaeologists studied the remains unearthed in @entity6 , they found evidence of 11 of wounds inflicted at or around the time of his death : nine to his skull and two to other parts of his body			1
the position of the injuries suggest that @entity2 had lost both his horse and his helmet when he was set upon by opposition troops			0
" the most likely injuries to have caused the king 's death are the two to the inferior aspect of the skull -- a large sharp force trauma possibly from a sword or staff weapon , such as a halberd or bill , and a penetrating injury from the tip of an edged weapon , " said professor @entity227 , who said the wounds were consistent with accounts of what happened to him at @entity204			0
tests also found an injury to the inside of @entity2 's pelvis which supports contemporary reports that his body was subjected to acts of ritual humiliation after his death			1
