" breast is best " -- you could call it a mantra of sorts that sums up much of today 's research on breastfeeding			0
not only does breastfeeding have clear short - term benefits , such as protection from infectious diseases and a reduction in mortality , it 's also been shown to be associated with an increase in intelligence			1
prior studies have shown an increase of up to 7.5 iq points in elementary age children who were breastfed , as well as an increase in verbal , performance and comprehensive iq in adults			1
the latest addition to this perspective is a long - term study of infants born in @entity27 , @entity28 , in 1982			1
published in @entity30 , the study interviewed 5,914 new mothers about their plans for breastfeeding and then followed up to see how they did			0
" information on breastfeeding duration was collected very close to the time when weaning happened , so we had a very precise information on the duration of breastfeeding , " said study author , dr. @entity34 , in a podcast on @entity30			0
what makes this study unique is that it followed the subjects all the way to age 30			1
" we were able to follow about 68 % of the participants , which is a very good follow - up rate , " said @entity34			0
" we observed that breastfeeding was positively associated with performance and intelligence at 30 years old , as well as with education , school achievement and higher monthly incomes			1
" in fact , @entity34 said the subjects who had been breastfed for 12 months or longer had a higher iq ( about 3.7 points ) , more years of education and earned roughly 20 % more than the average income level			1
" it 's suggesting that the positive effect of breastfeeding on @entity20 leads to a higher income , " he said			1
" this is our main finding at this moment			0
" one possible reason for the advantage of breast milk , @entity34 added , is that it is " rich in long - chain polyunsaturated fatty acids which are important to brain growth and development			2
" called @entity72 for short , these essential fatty acids are found in salmon and shellfish and have been added to infant formulas since the 1990s			0
however , the benefit to mental or psychomotor development from adding @entity72 to infant formula is unclear			0
because the study did not measure home life , intellectual stimulation or bonding between mother and child , it was not able to tease out whether these factors may have also contributed to the increase in iq			2
that leaves it open to critics , such as @entity92 professor @entity91 , author of " @entity93 ? " this study does not address the very real possibility that mothers who choose to breastfeed , regardless of income or education , distinguish themselves from those who bottle - feed in all kinds of ways that are likely to promote intelligence , " @entity94 wrote @entity0			2
for @entity34 , the implications of his study are clear : " the finding supports the promotion of breastfeeding			0
it 's more evidence that besides the clear short term benefits , breastfeeding also has long term consequences in terms of human potential			2

long - term study finds that iq at age 30 was nearly 4 points higher for babies breastfed for a year or more
study conducted in @entity28 also associates longer breastfeeding with higher income and education levels
critic points out that the study does *n't* *account* for other possible contributing factors
