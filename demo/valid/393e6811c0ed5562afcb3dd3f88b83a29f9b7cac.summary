@entity1 's new scheme to raise $ 60 million to purchase a luxury @entity5 airplane is the latest chapter in a long and sordid history of televangelists exploiting their churches ' tax - exempt status -- and their congregants -- to line their own pockets			1
preaching the word of faith , or " prosperity gospel , " and capitalizing on lax government oversight of his church 's finances has enriched @entity20 and his family to the detriment of his followers and the @entity25 taxpayer			0
@entity1 , @entity28 's 30,000 - member church , is a tax - exempt organization under the @entity30			1
that means the church 's donors receive a tax exemption for their donations ( including for @entity28 's new jet ambitions ) , and the church pays no tax on the revenue			2
what 's more , because it is organized as a church , the federal government does not require @entity43 to file a publicly available tax return , as other nonprofit organizations are required to do			0
those tax returns provide at least some financial information to donors and the public about the organization , including its revenues , assets , expenditures and executive compensation			0
@entity28 is known for his custom suits , luxury homes and private jets that ferry him , among other places , from his home base in @entity61 , @entity62 , to his satellite church in @entity64 , where he and his wife reportedly have a $ 2.5 million apartment			1
for @entity20 , though , these excesses are n't embarrassments			0
instead , they are proof that his theology works , that @entity72 blesses the faithful with abundant riches			0
@entity1 tells his congregants to " sow a seed " with him , promising that a plentiful harvest will be their own blessing and , essentially , a return on their investment			1
to promoters of the word of faith , or prosperity gospel , " sowing a seed " with your pastor is required for @entity72 's blessing , even if you 're taking it out of your rent money or the last remaining cash in your wallet			0
many @entity95 find word of faith a heretical theology , an embarrassing distortion of @entity100 ' teachings , not to mention a fraud on congregants			0
while the government can not constitutionally mediate theological disputes or otherwise interfere in a church 's internal affairs , it can use its oversight powers to ensure that preachers who use their pulpits for profit do n't exploit the tax advantages afforded to ordinary houses of worship to pursue their legitimate charitable purposes			2
in 2007 , the @entity119 , under the chairmanship of @entity118 @entity117 sen. @entity117 , launched an investigation into the financial practices of six televangelists , including @entity20			0
the committee requested documents from @entity28 and his wife , @entity125 , explaining that taxpayers " should be assured that their donations are being used for the tax exempt purposes of the organizations			1
" the documents sought by the committee included audited financial statements for @entity43 , information about related for - profit and nonprofit entities , and data on executive compensation and the church 's real and personal assets			1
more than three years later , after an outcry from the televangelists , most visibly @entity28 's mentor @entity143 , the committee opted to abandon its efforts to instigate any sort of regulatory changes			2
instead , the committee called on the ministries to engage in " self - reform , " even though the committee staff 's findings plainly demonstrated that four of the ministries , including @entity28 's , were unwilling to engage in any sort of meaningful transparency or accountability			1
of the six televangelists from whom the committee sought financial data , @entity28 was deemed the " least cooperative			2
" without @entity1 's cooperation , the committee was left to piece together a puzzle about his finances through public documents , third parties and news reports			0
it concluded that in 2006 , @entity43 had received $ 69 million in contributions at its @entity167 church alone , that the @entity20 owned two multimillion - dollar homes in @entity62 , and that the church and related business entities had at various points owned four aircraft flown for personal use -- although none was nearly as pricey as the luxury @entity28 now seeks to acquire			1
the committee staff was clearly troubled by the array of business entities , " including private airports and aircraft leasing companies , " that raised red flags " about the use of the church 's tax - exempt status to avoid taxation			1
" precisely because of @entity28 's lack of cooperation , the staff concluded , " we are unable to determine whether and the extent to which they are reporting and paying taxes on income earned in those entities			0
" @entity28 is now looking to raise $ 60 million for this new aircraft , purportedly " to continue reaching a lost and dying world for the lord @entity100			2
" four years after the abandonment of the @entity119 's televangelist investigation , it looks like the absence of government oversight has only emboldened @entity1 .			1

@entity203 : televangelist @entity1 asking congregants to help finance a $ *65* million @entity5
she says government should oversee tax - exempt churches that essentially operate as for - profit *enterprises*
@entity203 : @entity119 committee took up this issue but dropped it ; this seems to have emboldened @entity28
