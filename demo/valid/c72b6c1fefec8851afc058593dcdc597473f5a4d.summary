in the midst of all the shouting over @entity4 's new religious - freedom law , which many fear will lead to increased discrimination against @entity8 people , culture warriors marked the grim anniversary of another conservative " victory , " one that left more than 10,000 needy children without their pledged financial support			1
a year ago this week , i rose each morning with red , puffy eyes and heavy sense of exhaustion			2
i had n't slept soundly since march 26 , a day many of my friends and readers mark as the last day they wanted anything to do with organized @entity24			2
it all started when @entity26 , a humanitarian organization i had long supported and promoted , announced a change to its hiring policy allowing people in same - sex marriages to work in its @entity32 offices			1
in response , conservative evangelicals rallied , and within 72 hours , more than 10,000 children had lost their financial support from canceled @entity26 sponsorships			2
in addition , funding for schools , hospitals , water projects , and medical care was threatened as churches vowed to cut off support to an organization that hired @entity8 people			1
as one of my readers , @entity55 , recalls , " our church leadership vowed that they would pull all support , including over $ 2 million to build two hospitals in @entity54			2
" to try and stem some of the bleeding , i joined with other @entity26 bloggers to encourage my readers to sponsor children or make one - time donations to the organization			2
we had raised several thousand dollars and multiple sponsorships -- many coming from gay and lesbian couples -- when the ceo of @entity26 announced the charity would reverse its decision and return to its old policies discriminating against gay and lesbian employees			0
using wells and hospitals and child sponsorships as bargaining chips in the culture wars had actually worked			1
never in my life had i been so angry at my own faith tradition			0
many conservative evangelicals count the @entity26 reversal as a major victory in the culture wars			1
@entity85 , director of the @entity86 , told @entity87 he considered it " the best news of 2014 " for evangelical @entity89			0
" this was @entity24 at its best , " he said			0
but as i survey the battlefield a year later , i ca n't help but wonder if even the most strident culture warriors would consider the @entity26 campaign worth its many casualties			1
there are , of course , the families around the world affected by the sudden drying up of funds meant to support their hospitals and schools , not to mention the kids who used to receive letters and gifts from their sponsors , but whose pictures were casually ripped from the refrigerator and tossed into the garbage can once they were deemed expendable collateral in an @entity32 political battle			0
then there are the many gay , lesbian , bisexual , and transgender people , ( especially @entity89 caught in the middle ) , for whom the campaign represented yet another blow to their humanity			1
i remember a gay friend of mine telling me , through tears , " @entity89 do n't even think i 'm worthy of answering phones in the office of a humanitarian organization			0
what makes them think i would be welcome in their churches ? " and then there are the many @entity89 and former @entity131 for whom the @entity26 campaign was the final straw in a drawn - out disillusionment with organized religion			0
when i marked the anniversary with a @entity136 status on the topic , i was surprised by how many of my readers marked march 26 as the day they left the church			0
" i do n't think i can ever get over this , " wrote @entity140			0
" changed my views on evangelicalism and my faith forever			0
" @entity55 , who once taught @entity145 at his church , only rarely attends now			0
this is the tragic irony of the culture wars : the casualties tend to be the very people @entity152 went out of his way to serve : the poor , the sick , the marginalized , the outcasts , the people ostracized and deemed " sinners " by the religious elite			1
and when the world sees @entity89 hurting rather than helping such people , in the name of political gain , our testimony is profoundly diminished			1
we have lost the way of @entity152 when we are more committed to self - preservation than service , more occupied with waging war than washing feet			1
in all likelihood , @entity4 's religious - freedom law will not directly affect many people			1
but the conversation that has surrounded it , in which discrimination against @entity8 people has been characterized as a " deeply held religious belief , " will have far more lasting effects , not unlike the effects of the campaign against @entity26			1
so to the culture warriors , i plead : before you wage the next campaign , assess the potential collateral damage and ask yourself if it 's worth it			1
remember that the fruit of the spirit is not power or might , influence or entitlement			0
the fruit of the spirit is love , joy , peace , patience , kindness , goodness , faithfulness , gentleness , and self control , and " against such things , there is no law " ( @entity205 5:23 )			2
and to the wounded , i offer only this : you are not alone			0
please know there are field medics -- pastors and priests , artists and activists , poets and parents and healers and dreamers -- ready to welcome you back to faith and to church whenever you 're ready			0
we can walk the long road to healing together , even if it 's with a limp .			2

@entity4 's religious freedom law will not directly affect many people , but conversation around it , will have lasting effects , writes @entity231
the casualties of the culture wars tend to be the very people @entity152 went out of his way to serve , says @entity231
