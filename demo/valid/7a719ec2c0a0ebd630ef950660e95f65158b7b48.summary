@entity2 nearly 30 years after the first @entity5 stealth bomber took flight , the @entity1 's aging fleet is primed for a makeover ; albeit an expensive one			1
the @entity8 is looking to upgrade its stealth aircraft for the first time since the 1970s , developing a high - priority , super-classified , next - generation bomber			1
the @entity1 plans to award a contract to build and develop the @entity13 to one of the industry 's most powerful firms later this year and hopes to integrate them into the fleet by the mid- 2020s			1
competing for the prize are @entity19 , the developer of the @entity1 's current bomber , the @entity22 , and a partnership between aeronautic juggernauts @entity25 and @entity26			1
before the @entity29 earlier this month , @entity27 , assistant secretary of the air force for acquisition , suggested the @entity1 will offer a " cost - plus " contract to the winning firm , meaning the government will take on the risk of any cost overrun			1
" my belief on the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) is it 's going to be more traditional in the sense that we are doing a little bit more cutting edge " development , @entity27 said			2
the @entity1 has said it plans to leverage existing technologies to help keep the @entity13 affordable			1
however @entity44 , an independent , nonpartisan research group , warns " near - sighted , build - for - today acquisition strategies may render the issue of ' affordability ' moot , as affordability must also be assessed in the context of a capability 's mission effectiveness over its projected lifespan			2
" along with the @entity53 and the @entity55 tanker , the @entity13 is one of the @entity1 's top modernization priorities , and some experts say its development will go far beyond simply upgrading an aging bomber fleet			1
retired air force lt. gen. @entity61 told @entity3 this week that it is inaccurate to label the @entity13 as simply a " bomber " and that officials need to shed the " old think " way of categorizing airplanes into different mission areas			1
the new " @entity76 , " as @entity77 calls it , will have the ability to create a self - forming , self - healing " combat cloud " capable of sharing information with other aircraft and conducting a diverse array of operation types			0
@entity8 officials have stressed the importance of developing the new long - range strike bomber calling it critical to national security and nuclear deterrence			1
it is " absolutely essential for keeping our deterrent edge , " former defense secretary @entity83 said in january			0
" we need to do it			0
we need to make the investments			0
we 'll have it in the budget			0
" @entity61 said the no. 1 reason to upgrade the long - range sensor force is to counter the constantly evolving threats around the world			0
" the @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 ... have built advanced anti-air systems and long - range fighters , to attack our bases and aircraft carriers , " he said			0
adm. @entity102 , commander of the @entity103 , expressed similar security concerns to the @entity105 , thursday , telling lawmakers @entity97 is continuing to work on its program to deploy " long - range conventionally armed cruise missiles , " that can be launched from its bomber aircraft , submarines and warships			2
officials have been tight - lipped as to the specific capability expectations for the @entity13 , but indications are that it will be stealth , able to carry conventional and nuclear weapons and could possibly operate both with or without a pilot			1
@entity19 teased an initial structural design for the aircraft in an ad during the @entity122 , stopping short of highlighting specific features			0
@entity124 , a company spokesman , said the aircraft shown on tv is " representative of any future aircraft our customers may ask us to build			0
" generally speaking , @entity61 said the @entity13 must have long - range capabilities , be able to carry a large payload , have high survivability and have sufficient adaptability to incorporate evolving sensor and weapon technology			1
long - range capability provides the @entity1 with the flexibility to persistently respond to threats around the world and reach deep into enemy territory to hit fixed and mobile targets unreachable by cruise missiles , @entity61 said			2
large payload capability allows for operations with fewer aircraft and increases loiter capability and efficiency , he said			0
modernized stealth tactics and upgraded electronic warfare capabilities would allow the aircraft to enter enemy airspace without suffering prohibitive losses			0
the mysterious @entity13 program is the most expensive weapons system under the @entity1 's $ 17 billion research , development , test and evaluation funding request for 2016			1
the @entity1 requested $ 1.2 billion for the program under the president @entity162 's $ 534 billion proposed 2016 @entity8 budget			1
since 2011 , the @entity8 has said the @entity13 bomber will cost close to $ 550 million per airplane , projecting a $ 55 billion price total for 100 planes			1
critics insist the actual cost of the @entity13 will exceed the initial $ 500 million estimate ; yet @entity8 officials continue to publicly tout the cost figure			1
" it 's like $ 550 million per copy , " rear adm. @entity172 , the @entity8 spokesman , said this january			0
" it 's an estimate based upon multiple reviews of the program and not a single source			0
" @entity27 acknowledged the target cost of the @entity13 has increased due to inflation since the initial estimate was made in 2010 , saying " $ 55 in 2010 is $ 57 or $ 58 today			2
but we put it in as a requirement -- to build 100 airplanes , it 's going to cost $ 550 million ( each )			0
what that does is , that drives the design			0
@entity191 has to design to that number and we 're going to assess against that number			0
" regardless of the exact cost , @entity61 said price should not be quantified per individual aircraft , but rather within the context of what the @entity198 will be able to accomplish compared to the cost of carrying out operations with less - advanced , shorter - range aircraft			2
" how can we not afford it ? " he said , warning a failure to incorporate a combat cloud system could actually exacerbate budget demands			0
the @entity8 's @entity207 projects the @entity13 's budget will increase to $ 3.7 billion for research , development , test and evaluation in 2020 , bringing the total development cost to roughly $ 24 billion , according to the @entity214			1
if @entity1 buys 100 planes by the mid- 2030s , the research group estimates the program 's total cost will be closer to $ 90 billion			2
the @entity44 said intentionally planning to enhance an aircraft 's capabilities over time could also reduce the up - front sticker shock of the @entity198 " instead of buying them with all desired mission functionalities when they first roll off the assembly line , it may be possible to equip new combat aircraft with the most essential systems and plan future block upgrades to keep pace with emerging technologies and threats as funding permits , " the group said in a 2014 report .			2
