after months racing not only to treat @entity1 but to find ways to prevent it , health authorities will launch a vaccination campaign saturday in one of the areas that has been most devastated by the disease			1
the trial , using vaccines developed by the @entity10 , will be administered in @entity12 , a region that has had the highest number of @entity1 cases in @entity16			1
another vaccine will be tested in a subsequent study , according to a press release from the @entity20 , @entity21 ( @entity21 ) , and the @entity22			2
" we have worked hard to reach this point , " @entity20 director - general dr. @entity23 said			1
" ... if a vaccine is found effective , it will be the first preventive tool against @entity1 in history			1
" patient zero -- i.e. the first case in the current @entity1 outbreak -- is thought to be a 2 - year - old @entity16 boy who contracted the virus in december 2013 and died a few days later			2
since then , the vast majority of the more than 23,900 cases and more than 9,800 deaths reported by @entity20 have come in @entity16 and neighboring @entity37 and @entity38			2
there are new @entity1 cases every day , including 132 in the last week of february ( which is up from 99 reported the previous week )			1
while @entity37 did n't have any of these new incidences , @entity16 did -- especially in @entity43 and @entity44			0
still , authorities in @entity46 and their partners around the world have had significant successes generally in combating the deadly disease			0
the progress -- as measured in the rate of new cases , with january 's incidences being the lowest in seven months -- has been so significant that health authorities ' focus has shifted from slowing the spread to ending the epidemic			0
this positive movement has come as a result of steps like better disease control , public awareness campaigns and attention to burial practices			0
but the tool that has been used to eradicate many other contagious diseases -- vaccines -- has been elusive			0
that 's why , over the past six months , @entity20 has been working with scientists , ethicists and policymakers to try to create both better treatment therapies and a vaccine that will stop people for getting @entity1 in the first place			1
health workers in the @entity16 trial will start with a new @entity1 case and then trace all of that patient 's contacts , giving each of them the option of getting vaccinated			0
@entity85 - @entity84 , from the @entity22 , said this program is happening at the request of @entity16 authorities and called the participation of residents there " vital " to its success			0
" the @entity1 epidemic shows signs of receding but we can not let our guard down until we reach zero cases , " @entity20 official @entity94 said			1
" an effective vaccine to control current flare - ups could be the game - changer to finally end this epidemic and an insurance policy for any future ones			0

@entity20 leader : this vaccine could be " the first preventive tool against @entity1 in history "
this trial campaign will be conducted in a hard - hit region of the @entity116 nation of *guinea*
authorities have had success in curbing @entity1 , but dozens of new cases still arise each week
