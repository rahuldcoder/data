when photographer @entity1 wants to talk to a child at a juvenile detention center , he knocks on their cell door			1
he asks them if he can come inside			2
the 67 - year - old @entity7 is used to taking off his shoes when he enters homes , so he does the same in a cell			2
" most of the kids , they 've never had that kind of respect , " he said			2
" but i give it to them , i give them the power			2
i sit on the floor so they 're looking down on me			2
" @entity1 does n't begin by hammering them with questions			1
he wants to have a conversation			2
" i say , ' what 's gone on in your life ? ' " the result of that tenderness and patience is @entity1 ' latest collection of photos , " @entity33			1
" the images are unflinching			2
they convey the ugliness of a young person 's life behind bars			1
the pictures are replete with the unique loneliness , anger and boredom of a juvenile detention center			1
but the girls also tell their stories alongside the images			1
one photo shows a girl in a tan jumpsuit , hand on her head , sitting alone in a drab , cavernous room			1
" i 've been here 17 times , " one girl says			2
many of the stories are bleak , reflecting adults who endangered the girls or , at the very least , failed repeatedly to protect them			1
" @entity60 's a stripper			0
@entity62 was an alcoholic , drug addict , murdered last year , " said one girl explaining her past			0
" they took my brother and i away because my dad chained us in the house and tried to burn it down			0
i lived with my grandma and uncle			0
the people who are supposed to love you never do			1
" the photos show girls wasting the day in their bunks , staring at the wall			1
some struggle with mental illness			0
the girls obscure their faces or are turned away from the camera			1
that works to protect their identities , but it also evokes shame			0
@entity1 seems to be saying the shame is n't the girls ' -- it 's ours as a society for jailing children			1
his images are n't always literal			0
a photo shot toward an azure sky is framed by concertina wire			0
a straight - forward photo , of a utility wall holding dozens of scissors , turns the stomach after reading the caption -- the guards need the scissors to cut away any cloth a teenager might use to trying to hang herself			0
social media follow @ @entity107 on @entity108 to join the conversation about photography			0
@entity1 recalled one particularly agonizing interview with a girl who kept telling him , " i ca n't wait to get out of here so i can kill myself			1
" " she was just a kid , but she was at that place where you have no hope , " he said			0
" i feel all these stories , but that one just hit me hard			0
you want to say , ' it will get better , ' but you also know the system and you know that you ca n't say that			2
" @entity1 , the son of a @entity124 police officer , had a happy upbringing in a home of modest means			1
he got into a decent amount of trouble growing up , and he said he could have easily wound up in the justice system			2
but times were different then , he said , and there 's been a cultural turn in @entity134 toward criminalizing a child 's bad behavior			0
he recalls a detention - center director in @entity138 , @entity139 , who asked him to visit and take photos			1
at intake , he photographed a fifth - grader who had been taken to jail because he had acted up in class			0
" this fifth - grader came up to my belt buckle , " @entity1 recalled			1
" he was drinking warm milk , like someone gave him a cardboard thing of milk			0
i can still smell that milk			0
that intake area smelled like elementary school			0
" the child 's single mother could n't pick him up for hours			0
she was holding down a job that would n't allow her to leave until after 6 p.m. the detention - center director sent @entity1 ' photo to every principal in the area to make a point : children do not belong in lockup , so find another solution			1
@entity1 is adamant that he 's making photographs to bring about " immediate change			1
" he speaks across the country to law schools and works closely with child welfare advocates			0
his work has been shown during legislative sessions to illustrate how sorely the juvenile justice system needs fixing			1
" i 'm trying to wake people up , make them realize there are lives at stake , " he said			1
" at the same time , i do n't , i ca n't , position myself as the great hope			0
i might not be able to do much but listen			0
but i think i 'm a good listener , and i think these kids deserve to tell their stories			0
" @entity1 is a photographer based in @entity7			1
