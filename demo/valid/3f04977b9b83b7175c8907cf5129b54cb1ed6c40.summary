in " @entity1 , " @entity0 might be a fictional city ruled by an oligarchy of slave merchants , but the scenes had to be filmed in the real world			1
the citadel of @entity9 in @entity10 near @entity11 ( pronounced @entity13 - za - zat ) was chosen as the location , and is one of the most popular film - making destinations in the region			1
and scenes set in the ancient city of @entity20 , which was a big part of the final episode of season three , was filmed in @entity23 -- also in @entity10			1
but the creators of " @entity1 " were not the first to use the region 's beauty as the backdrop for a major international production			1
more than a decade before them , @entity29 chose the @entity32 country to film the gory glory of ancient @entity34 in his epic " @entity37 " starring @entity36			1
and so did the producers of " prince of persia : the @entity40 " which starred @entity41			0
indeed , big foreign productions seeking a @entity44 backdrop ( and possibly an academy award ) have long chosen @entity10 for its relatively cheap price tag and safety -- and nearly half of the films shot in the kingdom are made in @entity11			1
according to @entity52 , who runs two of the town 's biggest studios , foreign directors come for the dramatic light as well as the wide variety of landscapes			1
but @entity10 's appeal goes far beyond the beautiful vistas			1
filmmakers can find experienced local crews that help productions save half the cost they 'd pay in @entity65 or the @entity66 " logistically , [ @entity11 is ] very good , " says @entity52 , general manager at @entity67			1
" everything is very close by			0
people are very movie friendly and very efficient			0
" @entity73 's studios also offer dozens of set options -- from @entity76 temples to plaster - cast @entity77			2
@entity78 used one of his sets in the mini-series " @entity83 " -- the seven - week production was filmed by a crew of 250 people and included 4,500 extras			0
@entity88 @entity89 opened in 1983 to host the @entity91 classic " @entity92			0
" since then , around 200 tv shows and films have been shot there , including " @entity96 , " starring @entity97 and @entity98			0
" @entity10 is one of the countries that goes out of its way to welcome film makers , " says @entity99 , writer of the @entity100 to @entity101			1
" technical crews in @entity10 are well sought after -- builders , painters , extras , electrical resources			2
" but in recent years productions have been hit by the global financial crisis and the uncertainty following the @entity115 which ripped through @entity32			1
between 2008 and 2013 , @entity73 's revenue dropped by 50 %			0
such a slowdown hit @entity118 , where many of the 100,000 citizens rely on the cinema industry from employment			2
" the city is poor			0
there [ are ] few job opportunities , " says resident @entity123 , who once played @entity124 in a @entity78 documentary			0
" we are all just waiting ... there are millions of dollars that come into this city , but the city is still poor			0
" in the past decade , both of the town 's theaters have closed leaving residents without a place to watch the films shot in their back yard			2
changing times yet , a series of recent developments have started to show the start of a revival			0
last year , 22 films used @entity73 's studios -- up from 12 in 2013			0
foreign film projects spent $ 120 million in 2014 , according to the country 's film commission -- up from $ 23 million the previous year			1
and part of the reason filmmakers keep coming to @entity10 are the tax - incentives -- foreign crews are exempt from paying value added tax			2
but the other reason is the experience of @entity10 talent			2
" making stories of biblical proportions requires that there be casts of hundreds " says @entity159 , who is producing the upcoming tv series " @entity161 " in @entity10			1
" to wrangle that many people and have them be so focused and understand what they 're doing is a big part of what they 're doing			0
it save time , saves money			0
" @entity73 is so confident that the current boom will continue that he plans to build a brand new roman - themed set this year			0
he 's hoping to keep the cameras rolling and action going in @entity10 's @entity179			1
