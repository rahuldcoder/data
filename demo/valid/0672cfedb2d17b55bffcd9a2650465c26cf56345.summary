think back to your high school 's senior prank			1
maybe you and your pals slipped a pig into the building or greased all the door handles or turned all the chairs upside - down			1
so it 's no surprise that @entity12 high school principal @entity11 was reluctant to play along last week when a student showed up and told him to stand in the hallway holding a bucket			1
" she did n't say anything about why			0
she just said ' hold the bucket , ' " the @entity19 principal told @entity0 affiliate @entity20			1
" i 'm not going to hold the bucket unless i have a little inkling of why it could be			0
" good thing he changed his mind			0
once he did , student after student streamed by , dropping notes of praise and thanks into the bucket			0
" thank you for making high school the best years of my life , " one said			1
" you 've made my first year experience in @entity39 that i will always fondly remember , " read another			0
one student recalled how @entity11 " helped me get through my eating disorder and helped me get into therapy			0
" the notes were the idea of senior @entity45			1
she decided she wanted to do something nice for the principal and cooked up the plan with her mother			2
" @entity11 's an awesome principal , " she said			2
for @entity11 , who has been principal at @entity52 since 2006 , the experience was priceless			2
" became a little emotional on some of them , " he said , " i kind of read them and thought , ' man , this is better than a paycheck			2
this is why i do the things that i do			0
