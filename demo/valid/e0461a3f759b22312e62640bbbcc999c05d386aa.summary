on and off for over 40 years , i have had the privilege of roaming around the @entity3 of the @entity4 , usually as a member of the staff , sometimes as a journalist or visitor			1
for all that time , almost everything has been pretty much the same -- from the configuration of furniture in the oval to the four @entity14 sketches hanging in the hallways			0
but this past weekend , making a visit , there was something that was brand new and entirely welcome : there among the stream of visitors touring the @entity3 were many families of every color , especially @entity23			1
you may not think that is so different , but it is			0
for as long as i have known , the @entity3 has essentially been the preserve of whites , especially white men			2
my wife @entity29 and i , along with 10 - year - old grandkids @entity30 and @entity32 , were there for a superb , two - hour tour by a young man , @entity35 , once a college intern working with me and now an aide to the president			1
( he also happens to be white			0
) like most staff members over the years , @entity35 spoke with near reverence about his president as he pointed out many photos of @entity43 on the walls			1
what seemed so natural to him was what was what also struck me as new : photo after photo showed people of color working and meeting their president alongside and of equal standing with whites			2
of course , it did n't take a visit to the white house to know that @entity43 has promoted diversity			1
still , before seeing up close , i had not appreciated how deeply his approach has permeated day - to - day life			0
this @entity4 appears to be a model of racial , ethnic and gender integration			2
to be sure , earlier presidents had already taken steps down this path			0
president @entity66 was the first to name a cabinet in which women and people of color outnumbered white males			0
president @entity72 surprised some when he continued that tradition			0
but in the @entity3 itself , white men continued to dominate the inner circles			2
president @entity43 's efforts to allocate power in new ways have sometimes raised hackles			1
that three of the most influential people around him are @entity23 - @entity84 women is n't the issue , insist critics sotto voce ; rather it is whether two of them , @entity89 and @entity91 , are the right people for their jobs			0
both have come under periodic barrages			0
but to be fair , it is n't as if there has n't been a string of white males in the past who have been even less suited for powerful @entity4 jobs			1
as i left the @entity4 this past saturday , i knew that i would continue to grind my teeth over many of president @entity43 's policies along with his leadership style			1
but as a white southerner inspired by the civil rights movement , i must say that i was also impressed and grateful that he has made the @entity3 such a welcome home for @entity23 of every color and background			2
i will write my young friend @entity35 and tell him that one day , accompanied by his grandchildren , he will return to the @entity3 and be proud that he served under the first president to turn diversity into a living reality at the @entity4			1
that is one of the positive legacies of this president that deserves greater recognition .			0

@entity128 says @entity43 does n't get enough credit for *transforming* the @entity4
@entity32 : the president has turned diversity into a living reality in the @entity3
