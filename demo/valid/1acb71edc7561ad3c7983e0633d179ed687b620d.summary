@entity0 a huge @entity3 foreign policy decision , a big immigration question and interesting steps related to @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 filled an informative sunday loop around the ' @entity11 ' table			1
there 's nothing like a signature hire to quiet those who think you might blink and skip the fight			2
at issue is sen. @entity8 of @entity19 , who remains a single - digit blip in @entity22 polls			1
so weak have his early poll showings been that many @entity24 to this day say they would not be shocked if he decided not to move from exploratory candidate to official candidate			2
but a new hire sends a signal			1
veteran @entity30 @entity22 strategist @entity29 is signing on to run a @entity33 super pac			2
that same pac is in line for seed money from @entity19 billionaire @entity36			0
@entity29 is a protege of the late @entity22 gov. @entity37 and legendary @entity30 strategist @entity38			0
his hiring is seen as a signal in @entity22 circles that @entity8 is close to launching			1
for those of us who lived through the @entity45 years , and especially the @entity46 , it was interesting to say the least listening to @entity6 a few days ago wax nostalgic about her relationship with @entity48			1
and the former @entity50 speaker shared similar fond memories in a conversation with @entity53 of @entity54			1
but do n't break into " @entity55 " or order the marshmallows			1
" he said , if she becomes president , she 'll be a hard worker ; she 'll be pretty practical , " said @entity53			1
" however , he does n't think she 's going to get there because of what 's happening with the @entity63 and because of the foreign money			2
he 's testifying to the @entity65 next week and he says he 's going to bring up the problem of foreign money in @entity69 politics			0
" it 's been a rough start for the @entity72 and @entity50 speaker @entity7			1
but @entity7 sees a chance to get two big - ticket items on their way to passage , and through those debates to get the @entity50 back on a more productive track			1
@entity79 of the @entity80 shared his reporting on the speaker 's calculations -- including one health care bill where he struck up an alliance with @entity87 leader @entity86			0
" there 's two pieces of legislation to really keep an eye on that he wants to muscle through , " said @entity79			0
" one is the @entity22 budget : he wants to just get it through the @entity50 , get a compromise with the @entity97			1
and the next is the @entity100 bill , which is how @entity102 reimbursements are done for doctors			0
@entity7 wants to solve that long - term and it looks like he is going to have the votes to get it done			1
" president @entity3 meets with @entity109 president @entity108 this week , and is open to slowing the withdrawal of @entity69 forces			2
a big change , but with a bigger goal in mind			0
@entity115 of @entity116 shared inside reporting on the administration 's willingness to leave up to 10,000 @entity69 troops in @entity109 for the time being			0
" there 's one big reason why the president is going to have some flexibility in the drawdown , and that 's because he 's very focused on one specific aspect of this plan , and that is pulling out all @entity69 troops by the end of 2016 , " said @entity115			2
" that would allow him to make the case at the end of his presidency that he had fulfilled his promise to end the war in @entity109			0
" the always intense political debate over immigration policy heated up last spring during a dramatic surge in the number of young children illegally crossing into the @entity69			0
the surge undermined what was already a long shot chance of congressional consensus on immigration reform			0
@entity149 's @entity148 reports that both policymakers and political strategists are watching to see if there is a similar seasonal surge this year			0
" now we 're getting back into the spring season , when it 's a little bit easier to travel , and we 'll see if the numbers go up again , " said @entity148			2
" if they do , of course , we 're going to have another series of news stories about a really sensitive issue that 's been very difficult for either party to solve			0

a signal that @entity8 is close to jumping in
@entity7 trying to get the @entity50 back on track
@entity48 on why @entity6 wo n't be president
