update : @entity2 said in an phone interview monday that his interview with @entity5 was mischaracterized when an edited version went viral around the @entity7 last week			1
" she was n't upset , " he told @entity1			2
" when you watch the entire interview in the full context , you can see she instigates a lot of the ridiculousness that ensues in the interview			0
" @entity5 ended the interview laughing , @entity2 said , and " she was in on the joke			1
" this article has been updated and includes the unedited interview			0
if you 're going to interview @entity5 , please have some good questions prepared			1
@entity5 was talking to @entity2 of the @entity24 tv show " @entity23 " in conjunction with " @entity26 , " but @entity2 's offbeat questions led to an awkward few minutes			1
@entity2 thought he 'd begin the interview on a casual note , saying @entity5 would be a good person to have a beer with			1
@entity5 was having none of it			1
" this date is not going well ; i do not drink beer , " she responded			0
after some more back - and - forth , with an apparently sometimes testy , sometimes punchy @entity5 trying to steer the topic of conversation back to the film , @entity2 finally tried another angle			1
" how were you able to get that cat to do what you wanted ( it ) to do on a leash ? " he asked about a cat @entity5 's nasty stepmother has in the film			2
" i tried to put my girlfriend 's cat on a leash , and it just never works for me			0
" that was enough for @entity5			2
" that 's your question ? that 's your f * * * ing question ? " she asked			0
she stood up and awkwardly presented her hand			0
he later posted that it was " the best worst interview i 've ever done			0
" @entity2 later tweeted the unedited interview after an edited version went viral .			0

a @entity5 interview goes awry
the interviewer tries to ask @entity5 casual questions
but " @entity26 " star seemingly does n't take well to one of them
