forget the pyramids , @entity2 and the @entity3			1
@entity4 is ready to ditch @entity5 and build a shiny new capital if the government has its way			1
@entity9 up with pollution , traffic gridlock , a packed population with soaring rents and creaking infrastructure , @entity4 is teaming up with a developer in the @entity16 to build a city in what could be one of the world 's most ambitious infrastructure programs			1
the yet - to - be - named city will spread out over 150 square miles , or roughly the size of @entity26 , and could eventually be home to 7 million people , the developers and government announced friday			1
the current capital of @entity5 , while full of history and vibrant charm , is home to more than 18 million people , and living in and getting around the city can be maddening and frustrating			1
the government says the idea is to reduce congestion in @entity5 , which is projected to double in population in the coming decades			2
an exact location was not announced , but the city is expected to be built east of @entity5			1
it will be closer to the @entity41 -- between two major highways -- the @entity43 and the @entity45 roads			2
in addition to the new embassies and government buildings , it plans to have an international airport bigger than @entity52 , solar energy farms , 40,000 hotel rooms , nearly 2,000 schools and 18 hospitals -- all linked together by over 6,000 miles of new roads			2
but if the dream is big , the bill will be bigger			0
the total cost is estimated at @entity61 $ 45 billion , minister of housing @entity62 announced at an economic development conference in @entity65			0
the unveiling of the new capital was paired with a glitzy website with renderings showing a lush and technological urban scape of glass towers and pools			0
the plan is backed by a group that describes itself as " a private real estate investment fund by global investors focused on investment and development partnerships " led by @entity16 developer @entity79			0
@entity79 made his name as the founder of @entity83 's @entity82 , primarily known for developing the world 's tallest building , the @entity86			0
@entity4 is not the first country to plan on moving its capital from established big cities to rural greener pastures			0
@entity92 has only recently completed its move from crumbling @entity94 to the new city of @entity96			1
@entity97 moved to @entity98 in the 1990 's , and @entity99 carved its capital brasilia out of the wilderness over 50 years ago			0
and then there was another crazy idea of building a capital on a square of swampland that seemed mainly to be a boondoggle for wealthy land speculators at the time			0

the yet - to - be - named city will be roughly the size of @entity26
developers say it could eventually be home to 7 million people
