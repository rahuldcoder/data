pleading innocence , immunity and ignorance , the city of @entity1 responded to a wrongful death lawsuit filed by @entity8 's family by saying the 12 - year - old 's death was his own fault			1
in november , @entity1 officer @entity12 fired the fatal shots at @entity8 within two seconds of arriving outside a recreation center where the sixth - grader was playing with a pellet gun			1
in the 41 - page response to the family 's lawsuit filed friday , the city says that @entity8 's injuries " were directly and proximately caused by the failure of @entity23 ' decedent to exercise due care to avoid injury			1
" the response further says that " @entity23 ' decedent 's injuries , losses , and damages complained of , were directly and proximately caused by the acts of @entity23 ' decedent , not this defendant			0
" the city also claims it is entitled to all " full and qualified " immunities under state and federal law			0
as to the scores of other allegations in the lawsuit , the city responds by saying that they are untrue , that the independent investigation by @entity43 is still going on , or that the city " is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth			0
" @entity43 's medical examiner has ruled the death a homicide but has issued no determination as to whether the events that caused the boy 's death constitute a crime			0
@entity1 authorities have repeatedly said that @entity12 mistook @entity8 's fake gun for a real one			1
a witness called 911 on november 22 to say there was " a guy with a pistol " and that although the weapon was " probably " fake , @entity8 was scaring people			1
it does n't appear the dispatcher relayed the information to @entity12 and officer @entity69			0
video of the incident shows the two pull up on the snowy grass near a gazebo where @entity8 is standing			2
within two seconds of exiting the police car , @entity12 shoots the 12 - year - old			1
the boy died the next day of injuries to " a major vessel , intestines and pelvis			2
" in the video , neither @entity12 nor @entity69 appears to provide medical assistance to the boy , and police chief @entity85 has said that @entity8 did not receive first aid until an @entity88 agent arrived on the scene four minutes later			1
an attorney for the @entity8 family says the city 's response to the lawsuit is indicative of well - documented problems within the @entity96			1
" the @entity8 family maintains that @entity8 was shot and killed unnecessarily by @entity1 police officers , " @entity8 family co-counsel @entity97 said in a statement			1
" their tactics that preceded his death and the subsequent victim blaming are examples of the institutionalized behavior that has beset the @entity96			2
the @entity8 family 's lawsuit seeks to eliminate certain institutional behaviors and practices that have no place in our diverse community			2
" @entity8 family co-counsel @entity113 said the family was " just in disbelief " after reading the response			2
@entity113 went on to attack the police department 's assertion , put forth in december , that @entity12 gave @entity8 three verbal commands to put his hands up			1
" it is just incredible that the police officer , based on what we see on the video surveillance recording , gave @entity8 three verbal commands to put his hands up and drop the weapon , based on what we see in the video			1
it was less than 1.7 seconds			0
the car had n't even stopped			0
" @entity2 could not immediately reach the @entity133 for comment			0
@entity96 spokesperson @entity135 declined comment and referred questions to a city spokesman , who could n't be immediately reached			2
in december , the @entity139 released the results of a two - year investigation that found @entity1 officers use guns , @entity144 , pepper spray and their fists excessively , unnecessarily or in retaliation			1
the police force has used unnecessary and unreasonable force at a " significant rate , " employing " dangerous tactics " that put the community at risk , the investigation stated			0
it was also reported in december that @entity12 's previous employer , the @entity156 in a @entity1 suburb , had numerous complaints about the officer , including that he was " distracted and weepy " and " emotionally immature " and had demonstrated " a pattern of lack of maturity , indiscretion and not following instructions			1
" he also showed " dangerous loss of composure during live range training " and an " inability to manage personal stress , " the department said			0
in december , @entity113 called for @entity12 and @entity69 to be charged and decried what he said was a police tendency to let grand juries determine whether to charge officers involved in shootings			2
in @entity8 's case , he said , " several things were done inappropriately , " which is probable cause to charge the officers			1
" there is nothing written anywhere in the law that says police officers are to be treated differently from any other citizen , " @entity113 said			0
" we can not have children playing cops and robbers on a playground and police officers coming and claiming their lives			0
" @entity12 and @entity69 have been placed on paid leave pending the outcome of the investigation			0
@entity2 's @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 contributed to this report .			0
