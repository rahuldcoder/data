@entity0 was n't moving when rescuers found her , hanging upside down in her mother 's smashed car			1
it had flipped over into a frigid @entity7 river half a day before , and the baby was still strapped in her seat			1
as officer @entity10 dashed with the 18 - month - old in his arms to an ambulance , she was barely alive			1
but she 's doing better , her family said monday			0
" her improvement is astounding			0
right now she 's watching ' @entity15 ) ' and singing ' ( the ) @entity16 ' with @entity17			1
she is smiling and laughing for family members			1
we 're blown away by @entity0 's progress and so grateful to her rescuers , " they said			1
@entity0 's mother , @entity22 , died in the crash that had landed their car on its roof in the @entity27			1
she was 25 years old			0
@entity0 might have died unseen with her mother , had a man not gone fishing in that particular spot saturday			1
the angler waded into the river around noon , then noticed the car wheels - up in the water			1
" where the car was , you could n't see it from the roadway , " police lt. @entity35 said			1
the fisherman called emergency dispatch			0
police and fire rescuers arrived and sprang into the water			0
the rest of what happened is now a frenetic blur for officer @entity49			2
" i do n't remember doing anything but just doing it , " he said			0
the water was so cold that , when the rescue was over , seven of the men involved had to be treated for hypothermia			2
they heaved the car onto its side and saw @entity22 in the driver 's seat			2
it was clear to them that she was dead			0
then they noticed the baby			2
" she was definitely unconscious and not responsive , " @entity10 said			1
but she was still alive , and rescuers were delighted to see it			0
she was still strapped into her seat , where she may have been for 14 hours , if the wreck occurred when police believe it did			1
the night before , a man living nearby heard a loud crash and stepped outside to check , but he saw nothing unusual , police said , and dismissed it			0
that was at about 10:30 p.m. on friday			0
@entity22 's car had probably just struck a bridge embankment			2
" the driver 's side tire went up the cement barrier on the south end of the bridge , launching this woman and her baby into the freezing water , " @entity35 told @entity1 affiliate @entity79			2
the angler came along around 12:30 p.m. on saturday , 14 hours later			1
@entity22 's death is tragic , but the survival of baby @entity0 is a story filled with hope			1
but just how did the baby survive the ordeal ? above all , said @entity1 senior medical correspondent @entity95 , the biggest factor was the car seat			1
@entity0 was in the proper car seat and the seat appears to have been properly attached , @entity95 said			1
even though the child was trapped and upside down , her body remained in the seat and above the frigid water			2
doctors say that such low temperatures are dangerous , but would be even more so if the baby were wet			2
dry cold temperatures are more survivable than wet cold temperatures , @entity95 said			2
another factor may have been that the girl , as a toddler , has baby fat			1
if she had been an infant , it might have been a different story , @entity95 said			0
it 's a reminder that the human body is tough			0
@entity0 apparently survived for 14 hours in extreme cold , without food or drink			1
a mystery arose from the rescue : the police officers who entered the water say they heard a voice calling for help			0
the mother was dead , but the officers said that they heard an adult 's voice calling to them			0
" the four of us heard a distinct voice coming from the car , " @entity10 told @entity1			1
" to me , it did n't sound like a child 's voice			0
" the voice gave the rescuers a surge of adrenaline needed to push the vehicle upright , he said			0
the child was unconscious , but her eyelids were fluttering , and the rescuers knew she was alive , @entity10 said			1
it 's one of those things that does n't have an explanation , he said about the voice			0
" it felt like i could hear someone telling me , ' i need help , ' " @entity49 told @entity1 affiliate @entity150			0
" it was very surreal , something that i felt like i could hear			0
" @entity155 , a third officer at the scene , said the same			2
" all i know is that it was there , we all heard it , and that just helped us to push us harder , like i say , and do what we could to rescue anyone inside the car , " he told @entity1 's " @entity165 360			2
" the river is 10 feet deep in some places , police said , but the car hit a shallower spot			1
images showed it only partly covered by water			0
@entity0 was not submerged , said police lt. @entity173			1
firefighter @entity175 freed her from the wreck			0
he " grabbed the baby in my arm , raised its head up out of water , as i tried to release the seat belt , " he said			2
then @entity10 took @entity0 into his arms			1
" the child was passed to me and i ran up and climbed into the ambulance with the child , " he said			2
police have no explanation for the wreck			0
no alcohol or drugs were in play , they told @entity79			0
there were no skid marks leading up to the impact			0
a tow truck hauled @entity22 's car out of the river , and it will be inspected for possible mechanical failures			1
@entity22 's family has set up a gofundme page for donations to help with medical expenses for @entity0 , and funeral costs for her mother			1
late monday , it had reached more than $ 35,500 , surpassing its goal of $ 8,000			0
@entity1 's @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity95 , @entity212 @entity211 and @entity213 contributed to this report .			0
