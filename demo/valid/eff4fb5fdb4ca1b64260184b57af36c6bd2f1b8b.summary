in @entity3 's polarized political environment , support for @entity1 has been a rare area of bipartisan cooperation -- at least until now			2
@entity1 prime minister @entity8 's speech to @entity9 on tuesday threatens to undermine the nearly 67 - year tradition of bipartisan support that has endured since president @entity12 became the first head of state to recognize @entity1			1
@entity8 is driven not only by his concerns about @entity16 's nuclear threat -- the topic of his address -- but also by domestic political considerations			2
@entity1 will hold its national elections just two weeks after his visit to @entity3			0
@entity8 is fighting for his political life as he faces a tougher than expected re-election campaign			0
he has been widely blamed at home for having failed to lower the high cost of living , an issue that his rivals have eagerly exploited			0
@entity8 has tried to offset some of this criticism by focusing on his perennial issue : @entity16			0
a major televised address in @entity3 concerning @entity16 's threat , interrupted only by standing ovations from @entity35 lawmakers , has the potential to be far more effective than any campaign ad in projecting gravitas , reinforcing his security credentials and reminding voters of his vast experience -- in contrast to his rivals ' inexperience -- in foreign affairs			2
yet @entity8 's speech , while possibly giving him a short - term boost at home , will harm @entity50 's relations with @entity3 , not @entity16 's nuclear program			1
speaker @entity53 's late - january invitation to @entity8 to address a joint session of @entity9 was coordinated with neither the @entity55 nor the @entity56			1
it was , in essence , a political ploy aimed at undermining president @entity59 as he strives to reach a historic deal over @entity16 's nuclear program			0
in defiance of the @entity59 administration , and rejecting advice from leading figures in @entity1 and key supporters of @entity1 in the @entity35 , @entity8 accepted the invitation			1
by antagonizing the @entity55 , @entity53 and @entity8 have put @entity69 members of @entity9 in a bind , forcing them to choose between two unenviable options : either attend the speech out of respect for a close ally , but in so doing flout the president -- their party leader -- or demonstrate loyalty to @entity59 by snubbing the leader of a major @entity35 ally			1
two senior @entity80 with sterling pro-israel credentials , @entity82 and @entity83 , tried to diffuse this latest crisis between @entity3 and @entity50 by offering to meet with the @entity1 premier behind closed doors but were rebuffed by @entity8			1
@entity83 had previously noted that an invitation to address @entity9 during the @entity1 election period was " highly inappropriate			2
" in politicizing his visit to @entity3 , @entity8 has allowed his bad blood with @entity59 to spill over into his government 's increasingly complicated relationship with the @entity69			2
@entity8 no doubt believes that @entity59 is misguided about the pending deal with @entity16			0
indeed , there are good reasons to be skeptical of any agreement with a regime that has long engaged in deception and concealment with respect to its nuclear program			0
less than two weeks ago , the @entity102 reported that @entity16 was continuing to evade questions about evidence of past work on designing nuclear weapons			0
yet @entity8 's move is counterproductive			1
@entity80 on @entity108 who were inclined to support additional sanctions on @entity16 now feel compelled to back the president			0
in a rare move , five former @entity1 ambassadors have publicly called on @entity8 to cancel his speech			1
former @entity116 chief @entity115 has accused @entity8 of having caused @entity1 " heavy strategic damage on the @entity16 issue " by antagonizing the administration			2
@entity8 's foray into partisan politics is hardly a new phenomenon			1
he has never hid his preference for the @entity124			0
during his first term in office , @entity8 irked president @entity127 by meeting with the rev. @entity128 , then - house speaker @entity129 and other detractors of the president a day before coming to the @entity55			0
a key @entity8 supporter is @entity35 casino magnate @entity133 , a major @entity124 donor who also owns the @entity135 newspaper @entity134			2
during the 2012 presidential campaign , @entity133 poured millions into @entity124 challenger @entity138 's coffers , saying he was willing to spend $ 100 million to defeat @entity59			0
that july , @entity8 's senior adviser , @entity139 , helped orchestrate @entity138 's visit to @entity1 in what amounted to an implicit endorsement of @entity59 's rival			1
@entity144 , a former @entity35 citizen who once worked for @entity124 pollster and political consultant @entity146 , is @entity1 's current ambassador to the @entity35			1
it is @entity144 who coordinated the invitation to @entity8 with @entity53 but never mentioned the invitation to secretary of state @entity150 when they met a day before @entity53 's announcement			0
this time , @entity8 may have gone too far			0
national security adviser @entity153 did not mince words when she called @entity8 's latest move " destructive to the fabric of the relationship " between the @entity35 and @entity1			1
although the @entity35 - @entity1 relationship is strong and resilient , rooted in common values and shared interests , @entity8 is subjecting it to an unnecessary test with unknown consequences by choosing to play partisan politics .			1

@entity165 : by *injecting* himself into @entity35 politics , the @entity1 prime minister puts at risk a 67 - year relationship between two countries
@entity8 's speech to @entity9 poses a *problem* for @entity80 too , @entity165 says
