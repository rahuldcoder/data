for a generation of moviegoers in the early 1990s , " @entity4 " was a cultural touchstone			1
the breezy comedy had all the key elements of romantic fantasy : a plucky , down - on - her - luck heroine , a rich , dashing prince and a @entity12 love story with a fairy - tale ending			1
most of all it had a lesser - known actress named @entity16 , whose radiant smile and coltish charm lit up the screen			1
the movie , which celebrates its 25th anniversary on monday , grossed $ 463 million worldwide and made her the biggest female star in @entity24			1
but how does it stand up today ? not everyone is a fan			0
some critics complain the @entity29 film , whose female lead is an unrefined prostitute rescued from the streets by @entity33 's elegant millionaire , degrades women and glorifies materialism			1
here are some of the leading pro-and - con arguments about the movie			1
first , the cons : it whitewashes the realities of prostitution the movie glosses over the less - than - glamorous motivations that can lead women into sex work , says @entity47 , a board member of the @entity48 ( @entity49 )			1
most sex workers that @entity51 encounters through street - based outreach are not in it for a lark , or because they lack the drive to succeed , she says			2
they do it out of economic necessity after encountering roadblocks to traditional employment such as lack of education , a criminal record or sexual discrimination , she said			0
on one hand @entity16 ' character , @entity65 , is a compelling protagonist who dispels the stereotype of the drug - addicted " crack whore " with little ambition , @entity47 said			1
on the other hand , the movie implies that by virtue of her beauty , drive and apparent drug - free lifestyle , @entity16 is the exceptional sex worker who -- unlike her pal kit , for example -- deserves a better life			1
" what 's problematic is how it portrays sex work at large , like she 's the only one worth saving , " said @entity47 , a ph.d. candidate in criminology at @entity82			0
" you get the sense that she 's not the norm , and that allows us to get invested in her while not necessarily worrying about the welfare of other women who fall into the ( sex worker ) stereotype			0
" @entity65 's exit from sex work thanks to @entity33 's character is also troubling , she says			1
" in the movie she 's able to fill economic void with @entity104 's money but in reality that does n't happen , " she says			2
it 's demeaning to women like " @entity109 , " the movie is another reimagining of " @entity111 , " the @entity108 play about a crass , impoverished girl given a redemptive makeover by a sophisticated male mentor			2
@entity115 was one of numerous well - known actresses who turned down the part , saying it was " degrading for the whole of womankind			2
" the @entity65 character is clearly intelligent , and values love over money			2
but she also has no apparent career goals beyond becoming the kept woman of a wealthy businessman			0
" ' @entity4 ' may be a fantasy but it 's a deeply sexist , consumerist fantasy , " wrote @entity126 last year for @entity127 , a feminist movie site			1
" @entity129 and @entity33 's beauty , and sing along to @entity131 or @entity132 , but never forget that it is one of the most misogynist , patriarchal , classist , consumerist , and lookist movies ever to come out of @entity24			2
" it celebrates greed although he is dutifully appearing on tv this month to promote " @entity4 's " anniversary , @entity33 in the past has publicly dismissed the movie for glorifying @entity145 corporate raiders like his ruthless @entity104 character , who dismantles struggling companies			1
" it made those guys seem dashing , which was wrong			0
thankfully , today we are all more skeptical of those guys , " he told @entity153 magazine in @entity154 in 2012			0
the movie also depicts @entity65 's evolution from streetwalker to @entity161 socialite through an orgiastic shopping spree during which @entity33 promises to spend " an obscene amount of money " on her			1
" ideologically , ' @entity4 ' is a love song to consumerism and capitalism , " said @entity165			1
" ' @entity4 ' depicts a world where everyone is either a card - carrying member of the corporate caste or an obliging subordinate ... it is obsessed with things ( hotel suites , private jets , fancy clothes ) and encourages the audience to share its obsession with things			1
" and now the pros : no , it actually empowers women despite her lowly profession , @entity65 is no pushover			1
one of the film 's earliest scenes shows her refusing kit 's suggestion that they work for a pimp , saying " we say who , we say when , we say how much			0
" later , she negotiates the terms of her relationship with @entity104 and is quick to speak up when she feel she 's being mistreated			0
she humanizes him and even takes over driving @entity104 's borrowed @entity192 when he ca n't handle a stick shift			0
" she dictates the way she wishes to be treated ; when he offers her the status of a mistress , she dictates the status of a full equal , " writes @entity194 in a more recent @entity196 piece titled , " why ' @entity4 ' should be considered a @entity202			2
" " let us never forget that when the prince rescues her , she rescues him right back			0
" its shopping scenes are revenge - fantasy bliss ask some " @entity4 " fans to name their favorite scene and they do n't mention @entity65 's swoony moments with @entity104			1
they talk about that part in the middle when she hits @entity213 for a shopping spree			0
spurned at first by snooty salespeople , @entity65 later buys a slew of expensive outfits with @entity104 's money and then returns -- dressed to the nines and carrying handfuls of shopping bags -- to one boutique that had shunned her			2
" you work on commission , right ? " she asks a bitchy saleswoman			0
huge , " she says , turning on her heels to leave			0
" i have to go shopping now			0
" that 's why in the 1997 comedy " @entity240 , " @entity239 ( @entity238 ) tears up while watching the movie , saying , " i just get really happy when they finally let her shop			2
as slick entertainment , the movie works sure , its story is ridiculous on many levels			0
for all its modern trappings ( and r rating ) it 's also deeply old - fashioned : take out the sex and prostitution and it could be a @entity251 movie			1
but @entity33 and @entity16 , despite their 18 - year age difference , have genuine chemistry			1
the interplay between her goofy exuberance and his bemused stoicism is mostly effective			0
and @entity16 ' charisma carries the movie through its weaker spots			1
the script also has some zingers , as when @entity104 asks , " what makes you think i 'm a lawyer ? " and @entity268 answers , " you have that sharp , useless look about you			0
" on paper " @entity4 , " initially conceived as a gritty drama , should n't work			2
but it does -- if you do n't think too much			0
" all these years later , it holds up remarkably well , if you can turn off that think - piece portion of your brain , " wrote @entity271 this week in the @entity272			0
" ( is she a feminist icon ? is she only worthy of love when in @entity213 's finest ? is this just " @entity109 " with sex ? just give up already and embrace the absurdity			0

" @entity4 , " the @entity16 - @entity33 romantic comedy , was released march 23 , 1990
pros : @entity16 ( as @entity65 ) is empowered and shows humanity ; there a real " zingers " in the *dialogue*
cons : the movie glosses over harsh realities of prostitution and celebrates consumerism
