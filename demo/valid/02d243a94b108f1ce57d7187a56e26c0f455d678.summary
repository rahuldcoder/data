it was always going to take an extraordinary performance from a very talented swimmer to beat @entity4 at his favorite event in an @entity7 final			1
for more than a decade , the great @entity8 had vanquished all comers in the 200 meters butterfly on both the world and @entity7 stage , but then along came @entity12			2
when the @entity13 chased down @entity14 in the final 50 meters of the race to snatch a dramatic fingertip victory by 0.05 seconds he created one of the defining moments of the @entity20			1
as a 12 - year - old , @entity21 had gazed into his television set at home in @entity25 watching in awe as @entity14 , widely regarded as the greatest swimmer of all - time , won six olympic gold medals at @entity29 in 2004			1
so perhaps it 's not surprising that lining up alongside his hero in an @entity7 final eight years later took on a slightly surreal air			2
" my dream was always to swim like @entity4 so when i raced against him in the final it was actually a crazy feeling , " le @entity12 tells @entity1 's human to @entity37			1
" when i touched at 150 ( meters ) i think i was 1.5 meters behind him			0
when i turned i actually looked at him underwater and i thought i was him -- i know it sounds absolutely crazy , but i saw myself as him going past someone else			0
" " i remembered how he used to come off the last turn and , you know , smoke everyone ... i thought , he 's done this for so many years and i remembered that when i was swimming			0
i do n't know what it was but it was magical			0
" the mind - altering moment quickly morphed into a life - changing experience for the then 20 - year - old who edged out @entity14 in the final stroke			1
" it was such a huge moment for @entity13			1
obviously , to represent your country is a huge honor but to beat @entity4 at the @entity20 was amazing , " he says			1
" as a young kid everyone wants to be like their heroes but you do n't actually think one day that you 're going to beat them			0
" the remarkable victory was memorable not just for le @entity21 ' reactions -- which went from joy to disbelief immediately after the race -- but for those of his father @entity73 , whose elated response and subsequent tv interview have become an enduring part of the swimmer 's story			1
the excitable tribute to his " down - to - earth , beautiful boy , " which included repeated mentions of the word " unbelievable , " touched the hearts of viewers and turned @entity21 senior into something of a household name himself			1
" i never knew my father was such a celebrity until like five , six days after the @entity91 -- i was so wrapped up in ( my own ) bubble , " le @entity12 explains			0
" we were walking down the street and everyone was taking photos of me , but i could n't find my dad , and i saw him and there were a line of people taking photos of him and i was like : ' @entity103 ! you are stealing my thunder here			0
c'mon ! ' it was incredible			0
" everywhere he goes he 's that famous dad and that 's amazing because he really is			1
nothing was put on for the cameras -- that 's how he is back home			0
to my other brothers and sister he 's a great dad			0
" success in the pool has been rich reward for @entity73 , who steered the @entity118 towards swimming when a football career looked more likely			2
" my parents were hugely influential in helping me make decisions throughout my life , especially my sporting career , " he says			0
" when i was young i played football until i was about 13 or 14 years old -- i played for the state team ( @entity127 )			0
i had to make a decision and my dad realized that i was a better swimmer , even though my family had a football background			0
" ninety - nine percent of fathers would have told their son to play football ... i still thank him every day for helping me make that decision			2
" there is now another le @entity21 in the pool -- teenager @entity139 is hoping to follow in his brother 's large footsteps , having already competed at @entity13 's national championships			1
" you know , 2020 is very important to me , " says @entity118			0
" hopefully my brother can make the @entity20 then and swim in the same relay team			2
" originally a breaststroker , @entity21 switched to butterfly after he tore both his abductor muscles ( in the groin ) in 2008 when he was 16 years old			1
" @entity150 movement is really different			0
it 's unlike freestyle or other strokes where it 's very , very technical			0
i compare it to dancing -- i 'm a terrible dancer ! -- it 's about getting your hips right , your kick is very important			0
i just really enjoy it			0
it 's a fast stroke , so i guess the injury was a blessing in disguise for me			0
" while swimming 's toughest stroke remains his favored discipline , @entity21 has also struck gold in the individual 200m freestyle -- at the short - course world championships in @entity169 last year -- and the 400m medley ( butterfly , backstroke , breaststroke and freestyle ) at the @entity172 in @entity173			1
but it is butterfly where he has dominated in recent years			2
after pipping @entity14 in the 200m in @entity177 , @entity21 had to settle for silver behind the @entity8 in the 100m , but he has n't missed a stroke since			1
a 100m and 200m double at the 2013 @entity182 in @entity183 was followed by gold at the @entity91 in @entity185 , @entity186 last august			2
he capped a brilliant 2014 in december with three more titles ( 50m , 100m and 200m ) at the short - course worlds in @entity169 before being crowned @entity189 -- an award he is incredibly proud of			1
" the @entity7 gold will always be there and it will be the most outstanding moment of my life , but to win the 2014 swimmer of the @entity195 award was up there			2
not many people have won the @entity197 of swimming , so it was a very special moment for me			0
" for le @entity12 , who turns 23 in april , the best is almost certainly yet to come with another @entity20 fast approaching			2
he concedes that it will be " very , very difficult " to get anywhere near @entity14 ' record haul of 18 olympic gold medals ( and 22 overall ) , but he may get the chance to race him one more time			1
@entity14 , who announced his retirement following the @entity206 , made a shock return to the pool last year although things have n't exactly gone to plan -- the " @entity213 " is serving a six - month ban imposed by @entity212 after he was arrested for drink - driving last september			1
the ban has put his planned appearance at this year 's @entity215 in doubt , but @entity14 is still hopeful of qualifying for his fifth @entity20 in 2016			1
" i really , really hope that he and his team decide to swim in @entity219 , i really believe it will be great , " le @entity12 told @entity221 last year			1
" it 's added motivation for me ... with @entity4 back , it 's really sparked my fire , so to speak			1
i do n't think he will be worse in @entity219 , i think he 'll be back where he wants to be			2
he 's a champion in all respects but i believe i can beat him again			0
" if he can , then le @entity21 will have taken a giant step towards his ultimate aim of swimming and sporting immortality			2
" i want to cement myself in the sport as one of the greats			0
in swimming terms , i want people to remember @entity12 -- the guy that not only beat @entity4 , but who is the best fast swimmer of all time , " he says			1
" in @entity13 we have a rich history of great champions -- rugby players , cricket players , a lot of great golfers -- so i 'm among really tough competition , but i believe that after 2016 and 2020 i can hopefully be the greatest			1

@entity13 swimmer stunned @entity4 at 2012 @entity20
after defeating his *childhood* idol , @entity21 has dominated 100m and 200m butterfly
his father @entity73 is also famous for joyful celebrations following son 's win in @entity177
the 22 - year - old is hoping to *square* up to @entity14 again at @entity219 in 2016
