@entity2 militants kidnapped 20 foreigners working at a @entity6 hospital , then released them -- under the condition , if they want to live , that they stay put so they can treat members of the @entity10 extremist group , a hospital official said			1
about 30 gunmen tied to the group calling itself the @entity13 stormed @entity14 in @entity15 on monday while a bus was waiting to take the workers to @entity18 , @entity6 's capital			1
the medical workers were later released and sent back to their homes near the medical facility , a hospital official said tuesday			1
but they ca n't go far , with @entity2 militants ordering them not to leave @entity15 , according to the official			1
one of those kidnapped , a doctor from @entity27 , was told he is safe as long as he did n't leave , and he treated any militants who were wounded , the hospital official said			1
" they told him that , for your life , you ( stay ) and work in the city , " the official added			2
like the doctor , the other medical workers are n't @entity6			0
most are from the @entity37 , with others from @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			0
the kidnappings came days after people of @entity37 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 descent were taken from @entity6 's @entity50 oil field , an operation that @entity6 's internationally recognized government blamed on " @entity2 militias			2
" the abductions are more evidence of the turmoil @entity6 has experienced since 2011 , the start of an uprising against longtime dictator @entity59			0
@entity15 was @entity59 's hometown , where he was killed , and where his loyalists held out the longest			2
in the years since , @entity15 has become a home to @entity2			1
the coastal city , halfway between @entity18 and @entity63 , is where terrorists kidnapped 21 @entity66 from @entity67 in separate incidents in december and january			0
that mass abduction was followed by mass slaughter -- one that , in @entity2 ' distinctive , depraved style , was videotaped and disseminated as propaganda , showing jihadists standing behind their orange - clad , handcuffed victims and then beheading them			0
" the sea you have hidden sheikh @entity82 's body in , " a masked @entity77 - speaking jihadi said on the video , " we swear to @entity84 , we will mix it with your blood			0
" like the @entity67 , the medical workers kidnapped monday are foreigners , having come to @entity15 to work			1
they also have skills that could help @entity2			0
the @entity14 official believes the extremist group went after the workers -- who 'd been trying to flee @entity15 's precarious security situation -- because they make up the only medical team there and might be needed to treat @entity2 militants			1
the large - scale kidnapping illustrates how @entity2 has become a disruptive force in @entity98			0
the group 's main foothold is in @entity101 and @entity102 , where it has ruthlessly conquered territory and threatened to take more despite efforts by local governments and a @entity107 - led air campaign			0
@entity2 branched out into @entity6 last year , with @entity3 reporting in november that fighters loyal to the group had complete control of @entity111 , a city of about 100,000 near the @entity67 border			1
militants who 've pledged allegiance to @entity2 also have made their mark in points westward , forming chapters in cities including @entity15 , @entity63 and @entity18 , according to @entity119 , a former @entity6 jihadist now involved in counterterrorism as head of the @entity122			1
besides its actions in @entity111 and @entity15 , @entity2 ' @entity6 branch claimed responsibility for a january attack on a luxury hotel in @entity18 that killed 10 people , one of them @entity107 @entity129			2
but @entity2 is n't just active in @entity6			2
earlier this month , @entity130 -- another @entity10 extremist group with its own reputation for mass abductions and craven brutality -- pledged allegiance to @entity2 leader @entity135			0
this bond gives @entity2 a gateway to @entity98 and specifically to @entity138 , @entity98 's most populous nation and @entity130 's home .			0

@entity2 tells doctor to stay , treat militants , hospital official says
about 30 gunmen stormed the @entity15 hospital , took 20 foreigners *captive*
@entity2 has been active in @entity15 , where it also abducted @entity149 from @entity67
