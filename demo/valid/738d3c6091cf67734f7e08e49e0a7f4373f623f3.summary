it was a ding , just a " minor concussion , " that got @entity2 thinking that playing football might not be worth the millions that come with being an @entity6 player			1
@entity2 was a rookie linebacker in his first training camp in august when he got his " bell rung , " he told @entity11 's " @entity12			1
" what did he do ? he kept playing that day , and through an excellent rookie season			2
but the thought of the permanent damage that might be happening to him kept nagging at him			2
he talked to his teammates and family , read about concussions and their effects , each day coming closer to the decision that he finally announced this week			1
at age 24 , not even yet in his prime as an @entity6 player , @entity2 told his team he was retiring because he was worried about the long - term effects of head trauma			1
" i just honestly want to do what 's best for my health , " he told @entity11			1
" from what i 've researched and what i 've experienced , i do n't think it 's worth the risk			2
... i 'm concerned that if you wait ( until ) you have symptoms , it 's too late			2
" it was after that self - described " minor concussion " in the preseason that @entity2 threw himself into researching what had happened to other football players			1
in the end he did n't want to leave his teammates in a bind , but , " i know this is right for me			2
" he said teammates ' reactions to his retirement were mixed			2
one of his best friends told him that he was crazy to walk away from the money			2
@entity2 , a third - round pick from @entity56 , had signed a nearly $ 3 million contract for four seasons with the @entity59 and banked a $ 600,000 bonus			1
the guys who wanted him to come back would say to the 49ers top tackler , " that 's a lot of money			1
why do n't you get your money and get out , " @entity2 recounted to @entity11			1
the thought made him uncomfortable because he does n't want to do anything just for a big paycheck			2
he did n't want to be wrong when it comes to this : " who knows how many hits are too many ? " @entity2 is one of a handful of players to retire young but possibly the first to retire before concussions became an issue for him			1
he 's also now part of a shift in thinking about what repeated head injuries can do to an athlete			2
reports show an increasing number of retired @entity6 players who have suffered concussions developed memory and cognitive issues such as dementia , alzheimer 's disease , depression and chronic traumatic encephalopathy , or @entity94			1
" for me , it 's wanting to be proactive , " @entity2 said			1
" i 'm concerned that if you wait ( until ) you have symptoms , it 's too late			2
there are a lot of unknowns			0
i ca n't claim that ' x ' will happen			0
" i just want to live a long , healthy life , and i do n't want to have any neurological diseases or die younger than i would otherwise			0
" passionate reactions to his decision came quickly , with many supporting him			0
others say that while the move might be smart for @entity2 , and even encourage other players to speak out and stand up for their health , there will always be plenty of guys eager to replace players like him			1
@entity2 told @entity11 that he was n't saying no one should play football			1
he said youth players and their parents should do things : 1 ) get informed about concussions and 2 ) never let anyone play last august , thousands of former @entity6 players and their families reached a deal in a class - action suit that called for the @entity6 to cover the cost of concussion - related compensation , medical exams and medical research for retired players and their families			1
the suit alleged that the @entity6 deliberately misled players about scientific data that the medical community had found about the risks associated with concussions			1
in july 2014 , a federal judge granted preliminary approval to the landmark deal but she has yet to give final approval to the settlement			0
@entity143 was one of the plaintiffs			0
her husband , former @entity147 @entity145 , committed suicide in 2009 when he was 38			1
after his death , scientists found evidence of @entity94 in his brain			0
@entity2 named three players he said made him rethink a life in the @entity6			1
" i 've thought about what i could accomplish in football , but for me personally , when you read about @entity158 and @entity159 and @entity160 , you read all these stories			0
and to be the type of player i want to be in football , i think i 'd have to take on some risks that as a person i do n't want to take on , " he said			0

@entity160 , who played eight seasons with the @entity187 , committed suicide in 2012			1

friends and family members say multiple concussions were to blame for the suicide , but an initial autopsy report found no apparent brain damage			1
