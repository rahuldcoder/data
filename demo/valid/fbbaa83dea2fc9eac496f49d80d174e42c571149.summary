@entity0 will forever be remembered as the man who transformed a mosquito - ridden colonial trading post into a prosperous financial center with clean streets , shimmering skyscrapers and a stable government			1
born in 1923 , @entity0 became prime minister in 1959 when @entity9 , a tiny spit of land with no natural resources and a polyglot population of @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 , was still @entity18 territory and beset by riots and unrest			1
he presided over @entity9 's bitter split from @entity22 in 1965 and molded the independent country into the global economic powerhouse it is today			1
" i was trying to create , in a third - world situation , a first - world oasis , " @entity0 told @entity1 in 2008			2

his brand of capitalism -- which stresses the role of government rather than the free hand of the market -- has provided a blueprint for @entity14 's landmark economic reforms			0
but @entity0 was also a divisive figure , attracting criticism for stifling media freedom and for the harsh treatment of political opponents			1

@entity0 voluntarily stepped down as prime minister in 1990 , the first @entity56 strongman to do so			1
however , he played a role in the country 's @entity58 until 2011 when his eldest son , @entity60 , was elected for a second term as prime minister			1
the elder @entity0 retained his influence around the world			2
" this is one of the legendary figures of @entity56 in the 20th and 21st centuries , " @entity64 president @entity29 said during a meeting with @entity0 at the @entity66 in october 2009			2
" he is somebody who helped to trigger the @entity56 economic miracle , " @entity29 added			0

a bright student , he gained a place in the city 's elite @entity83 and went on to study law at @entity86 at @entity87			0
he attributed his decision to go into politics to his experiences during the @entity92 occupation of @entity9			0
" i learned how people survived and how people had to submit because you need to eat and your family needs to live , so i learned the meaning of power , " he told @entity1 in 2002			0
the city @entity0 took control of in 1959 was still recovering from the ravages of war and could not have been more different from today 's @entity9			1
however , @entity0 told @entity1 he had no " great vision of transformation			0
" he concentrated on attracting investment and creating jobs ; first finding a successful niche in electronics manufacturing by touting @entity9 as an alternative to @entity110 , which he said was in turmoil due to the @entity112 in @entity14			0
while @entity0 has been lauded for his economic accomplishments , he also created a @entity9 bound by stringent laws and regulations that dictated most , if not all , aspects of society -- including media and political freedoms , censorship and even the selling of chewing gum			1
the country ranks 150th in @entity124 , putting it just above the @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128			0

" i want social peace and stability within the country			0
i am not following any prescription given to me by any theoretician on democracy , " he said			0
while @entity0 is likely to be remembered with affection and pride by many @entity9 , a younger generation , with no memory of the poverty and violence that marked the country 's birth , is questioning the @entity0 dynasty 's control of @entity9 politics and pushing for greater democracy			1
in 2011 , the @entity52 lost six seats to the opposition , prompting @entity0 , then the party 's " minister mentor " and another former prime minister , @entity180 , to resign			1
in a joint letter to parliament , the two explained they " decided to leave the @entity58 and have a completely younger team of ministers to connect to and engage with this young generation in shaping the future of our @entity9			0
