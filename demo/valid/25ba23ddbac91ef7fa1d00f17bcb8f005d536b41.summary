@entity1 president @entity0 has told @entity3 to end its " intolerable " ban on women attending football matches			1
writing in the @entity8 magazine published by world football 's governing body , @entity0 described the situation as one that " can not continue			1
" @entity3 's ban was put in the spotlight at the @entity14 in @entity15 earlier this year , when thousands of female @entity3 fans watched their team without restriction			1
at the match against @entity21 , activists unfurled a banner showing the face of @entity24 , a @entity25 - @entity3 woman jailed for trying to watch a volleyball match against @entity27 in 2014 , and called for the ban to end			1
the measure was imposed following the @entity30 because the idea of mixed crowds was deemed un-islamic			0
@entity3 is in the running to host the 2019 edition of the @entity36 tournament , for which the @entity37 is also bidding			1
but the ban is widely expected to scupper its chances of securing the event			2
@entity0 wrote : " i raised the topic at my meeting with the president of @entity3 , @entity43 , and came away with the impression that this intolerable situation could change over the medium term			1
" however , nothing has happened			0
a collective stadium ban still applies to women in @entity3 , despite the existence of a thriving women 's football organization			1
" this can not continue			0
hence my appeal to the @entity3 authorities -- open the nation 's football stadiums to women			1
" during last year 's football @entity58 , @entity2 reported how fans in @entity3 gathered to watch games in venues that defied a ban on public screenings			1
at one coffee shop in the capital , @entity67 , the tense game against @entity69 -- a game @entity3 lost only to an injury - time @entity72 goal -- was watched by a large mixed crowd			1
" 100 percent it 's better this way , " said @entity75			0
" it does n't happen often			0
it would be great if we have more of this			0
" " it 's actually much better to watch it with a bunch of people around because it makes you feel more excited , " said @entity82			0
hoardings advertising the @entity58 throughout @entity67 that summer had featured no pictures of women			2
and state tv broadcasts of matches employed a delay of several seconds in order for images of female fans deemed too racy to be censored			0
@entity0 also hit out at football 's continental confederations for failing to elect any women onto governing body 's executive committee			2
the committee includes three women -- one of whom has voting rights and two of whom are co-opted -- but they are elected directly by the @entity1 congress following a change to the statutes in 2011			2
" this was hard work because the members of @entity1 's executive committee are elected by the national associations ... and there was never , never a proposal for a woman to be finally in @entity1 , " the 78 - year - old said at an event in @entity115			2
" we had to take the decision , and i did it in 2011 at the end of the congress , [ that ] we must have at least one woman on the executive committee			0
" he described football as a " macho " sport and warned : " we should change in the future			0
