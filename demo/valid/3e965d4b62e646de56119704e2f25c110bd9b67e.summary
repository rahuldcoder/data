we ca n't settle @entity2 vs. @entity3 or " @entity4 " vs. " @entity5 " for you			0
but we can settle another long - running geek debate : those short , animated loops that have captivated the web for decades ? they 're pronounced like a brand of peanut butter			2
@entity13 created the @entity14 , or @entity14 , while working for @entity15 in 1987			1
when he received a @entity16 in 2013 for it , and delivered his five - word acceptance speech ( that 's all the @entity16 allow ) , he flashed a @entity14 on the big screens at the @entity20 in @entity21			1
and , in a flash , it all became clear : " it 's pronounced @entity25 , not @entity14			1
" of course , in the grand tradition of heated debate , a flat statement of fact by the creator was n't enough to sway some partisans			1
on @entity32 , " @entity14 " became a trending topic as some folks pushed back			1
# gif # hardg , " wrote web designer @entity36			0
" so instead of @entity14 , we 've got to say @entity25 ? yeah right , " chimed in october @entity39 , creator of the " @entity42 " @entity40 and book			1
" and i suppose those animals with long necks are called ' @entity45			0
' " and , of course , the peanut butter brand was getting lots of free publicity along the way			0
the always amusing @entity52 account ( yes , somebody tweets as the robot from " 2001 " ) posted an " animated @entity25 " -- which is to say , a swirling , animated jar of the tasty , high - protein spread			2
animated gifs were a staple of the early @entity60			0
remember the @entity61 ? that 's a @entity14			1
they fell out of favor as more advanced graphics technology emerged			0
but in the past couple of years , the @entity66 has remembered how much fun it is to watch ridiculous things happen over and over again			0
@entity13 has argued for the soft - g pronunciation for years			2
yet no less an authority than the @entity73 has posted an image on its @entity40 feed advocating for the hard - @entity76 and the @entity77 says both pronunciations are acceptable			0
so , here 's wishing mr. @entity80			2

@entity14 creator : it 's pronounced " @entity25 "
@entity13 created the @entity14 in 1987 at @entity15
he pronounced the issue *closed* at the @entity16 in 2013
and yet , some partisans remain *unswayed*
