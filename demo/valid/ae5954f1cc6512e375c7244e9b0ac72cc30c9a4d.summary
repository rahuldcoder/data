@entity0 gave us a sneak peek at his new costume last week , and followed it up with a first look on video			1
the actor posed on a bearskin rug to show off how he looks as masked @entity11 character @entity9 in a post that quickly got positive responses from fans on social media			2
the photo is a parody of @entity19 ' famous nude image from a 1972 issue of @entity21 and is very much in keeping with @entity9 's wisecracking , tongue - in - cheek persona			0
( here 's the original , in case you were born after 1972 or chose to delete the image from your mind			0
) @entity9 's costume , a favorite among comic book fans and convention cosplayers , includes a mask that covers the entire face , so we might not see the face of 2010 's sexiest man for much of the movie			2
@entity0 played @entity9 in 2009 's " x-men origins : @entity42 , " but he never wore the famous red and black attire			1
instead , he wore an unremarkable black suit bearing none of the hallmarks of the costume worn in the comics			0
as the vanity shot indicates , @entity0 will be fully suited when returns to the role in first the feature - length " @entity9 , " scheduled for release in 2016			1
in response to skepticism online who was beneath the mask , screenwriter @entity53 confirmed via @entity58 that @entity0 was indeed in the suit			0
then as a special treat for @entity61 , @entity0 was " interviewed " by " extra " host @entity62 , about the debate over whether the movie should be rated @entity65 or @entity65 the ultraviolent @entity9 would seem to lend himself to an r rating , but @entity0 settled all that in memorable fashion , " killing " @entity62 in the process .			1

@entity0 debuts first look at his @entity9 costume
not to be *outdone* , @entity75 *announced* he is *retiring* the @entity42 character
