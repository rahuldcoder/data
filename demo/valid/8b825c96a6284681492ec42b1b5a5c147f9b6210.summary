warning : this article contains offensive language			0
slut , ho , hussy , heifer , bitch -- long before i ever heard those words flow in a rap song , i heard them first in my own home , my own neighborhood			1
and too many times , they were directed toward me or one of my grade - school girlfriends			2
you see , for generations , black girls have been so conditioned to being called these over-sexualized names -- first by our slave masters , then our mothers , sisters , friends and eventually the world -- that today many times we do n't even take offense			1
we deny our pain or hurt feelings			0
we even make excuses for the name - callers because it 's difficult to decipher , especially for young girls , when the offender means it in a tough love , sisterly kind of way or a " he did n't mean it in that kind of way , " as @entity42 standout @entity43 said on @entity45 's sportscenter on monday			1
she was explaining why she had forgiven @entity48 baseball player @entity47 recently			0
@entity43 emailed the university to ask for @entity47 to be reinstated			1
here 's what he had tweeted after hearing that @entity51 plans to produce a movie based on @entity43 ' life titled : " @entity54 " : " what a joke			1
that slut got rocked by @entity57			2
" ugly , jealous , hateful words meant to intimidate and objectify a 13 - year - old girl			2
but @entity43 was quick to respond with a class beyond her years : " everyone makes mistakes and everyone deserves a second chance , " she told @entity45			1
" ... i know right now he 's really hurt and i know how hard he worked to get where he is			2
i mean , i was pretty hurt on my part but i know he 's hurting even more , " said @entity43 , the first girl in @entity71 history to earn a win and pitch a shutout			1
@entity76 immediately kicked @entity47 off the team but now says it will review the matter			1
i hope the school sticks to its decision			0
it was the right call and the university 's action spoke volumes about its integrity -- and how it values women and girls			1
surely , @entity48 believes that sports are meant to teach more than simply how to hit , catch and run			0
we talk about using sports to build character , leadership and respect for others			0
@entity47 seems to have missed those lessons , or maybe he just thinks they do n't apply to women			0
his promising college baseball career does n't have to end over this mistake			2
let the school review the situation next season ; see then if @entity47 has had time to truly understand his actions			0
good for @entity43 , for rising above the hateful remark — and also above the outrage on social media , where millions rose to her defense — to offer such a gracious response			1
but it should go without saying : it 's never ok or excusable to attack a successful 13 - year - old girl with such a chauvinist remark			1
neither little girls , no matter their ethnicity , nor grown women are open targets for sexist , ignorant public attacks			2
the incident provides a good opportunity , however , for we in the black community to consider how we value our daughters			1
and we must take note that our sons are watching closely as they try to navigate what it means to respect a young woman today			2
men who grow up to disrespect women do not only learn those lessons by watching tv or playing video games			0
and though it may be convenient to blame pop culture , rap music is not responsible for teaching men to disrespect women			2
we parents own much of the blame			0
overworked , frustrated mothers and fathers often can not find the words or the courage to have a conversation about sex with their children who are not even teens yet			0
but that 's when the questions start for most kids			2
just about every day in my old neighborhood , a playmate would get called out of her name for violating an unspoken rule about how a 9 - year - old girl should behave : " get your trifflin ' ass in the house , you little hussy			1
why are you dressed like a little slut ? " an angry mom would yell down the street			0
every little girl i knew heard that rant , including myself			0
and as kids do , it was n't long before we were all giggling and calling one another those very same names			1
i do n't really know how other mothers talk to their young daughters , or at least i did n't back then , but in my black neighborhood , often the conversation between mothers and daughters was not pretty			1
you had two choices : develop a tough skin or believe the ugly words and let your innocence be destroyed by their cruelty , even if unintended			0
too many of my friends were destroyed as they struggled with the confusing messages and lack of forthright explanation and support on sexuality			0
it led to young teenage pregnancies , abusive boyfriends and destructive behavior			0
who knows what those beautiful girls , once so full of ambition and curiosity about the world , would have become if they 'd been called : beautiful , strong and smart			1
maybe they would have been just like @entity54 ' .			0

@entity208 : @entity209 called @entity43 slut in a tweet . she graciously asked his college to reinstate him after he was kicked from team
@entity215 : black girls conditioned from young age by culture and even family to accept being called over-sexualized names
she says it 's hurtful , confusing , can have long - term effect . community should recognize the harm this does to young , smart , strong girls
