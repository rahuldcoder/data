@entity1 , who collaborated along with his late brother @entity3 in a documentary film career that included the troubling 1970 concert documentary " @entity6 , " has died			1
the director and cinematographer , an @entity13 nominee , died thursday at his home in @entity15 of natural causes , @entity7 , marketing director at the @entity8 in @entity9 , confirmed to @entity0			2
" @entity6 " -- which chronicled the 1969 @entity18 tour that culminated in the @entity19 , in which a fan brandishing a gun was stabbed to death by a @entity24 security man — stood in a stark and more enduring counterpoint to the myth of the documentary " @entity28 , " a depiction of the glorified 1969 free concert whose own dark side was left out in its pre-conceived , celebratory style			1
their most well - known film , " @entity36 " ( 1975 ) , was a profile of @entity39 ' eccentric cousins -- mother and daughter @entity42 and @entity43 -- who lived in a dilapidated , cat - packed estate in @entity45 , @entity9			1
the brothers worked with fellow directors @entity47 and @entity49 on the film , which was remade as a @entity53 - winning @entity52 play and as an award - winning 2009 @entity55 drama that starred @entity57 and @entity58			1
just prior to " @entity6 , " they filmed " salesman " ( 1969 ) , which covered six weeks in the lives of four door - to - door @entity63 salesmen			1
the brothers , who preferred the moniker of filmmaker rather than director , often focused on musical figures			1
@entity1 was a cameraman on @entity71 's " @entity70 " ( 1968 ) , about the celebrated @entity73 music festival that featured electrifying performances from the likes of @entity76 and @entity77			1
@entity78 : @entity1 on @entity79 , @entity80 ( @entity81 ) during that period of their career , they also collaborated on such direct cinemas as " @entity87 ! the @entity88 in the @entity89 " ( 1964 ) , " with love from @entity91 " ( 1966 ) and " meet @entity92 " ( 1966 ) , which premiered at the @entity93			1
in 1968 , they made " @entity95 : the @entity98 , " and the following year , they shot " @entity99 , " also for tv			2
we 're out to discover what is going on behind the scenes and get as close as we can to what is happening , " he said of their cinematic style			2
there were often emotional reactions to their films ; fans applauded them for the trust they developed with their subjects , allowing them to reveal long - repressed feelings or telling insights			1
their style -- with their subjects caught by a hand - held camera and shotgun mike -- was in the tradition of such documentarians as @entity121			1
however , cinema verite " purists " argued that the @entity122 sometimes exploited the content , particularly in regard to the omniscient editing of " @entity6 , " where their flashback storytelling style created a dramatic foreboding and " imposed " a narrative on the @entity18 ' tour			1
flashbacking from @entity133 reviewing their footage , with @entity19 's horrific memory in the recent past , " @entity6 " punctuated a feeling of dread as the events moved inexorably to the tour 's cataclysmic end			1
originally , the " free concert " was planned to happen in @entity143 , but logistics went askew and it ended up at the @entity146 in @entity73			2
muddled by inadequate planning and the darkness at the fringes of the peace / love zeitgeist , the concert was a ghoulish nightmare			2
admittedly , the @entity122 straddled a line between artistic license and nonfiction narrative			0
" @entity157 and @entity158 often argue that all they 're doing is filming what 's there			0
the detail is comment : fingers scratching , soft focusing			0
a filmmaker is always making comments , " cinematographer @entity165 once opined in a @entity167 article			2
