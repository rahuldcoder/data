@entity0 wanted to buy a watch			1
it was in @entity4 that he decided to purchase one particular model , one which cost $ 15,000			2
for a former @entity15 footballer , a hero in his native @entity9 , and one of the most successful @entity12 footballers of all time , the prospect of buying a watch was hardly the most daring of ordeals			0
so after taking a glance at the watch and getting out his credit card , he says he asked the sales assistant for some help			0
" i asked the saleswoman -- who was also black like me -- ' could you show me that watch please ? ' " first , i saw her turn and look at her coworkers like , ' uh , what should i do ? ' " eventually , she let me see the watch			0
i looked at it and said , ' ok , i 'll buy it			0
' " i took out my credit card and when she went to go run it through the machine , she came back and said that it was declined			0
" i asked her , ' was it declined or did you not want it to be accepted ? ' because this has happened to me many times and she told me , ' no , it was declined			0
' " @entity0 , who played in @entity4 with @entity43 last season , called his brother who was nearby and it was he who brought a new credit card so the transaction could be completed			1
while @entity0 does speak @entity51 , his brother has a far wider vocabulary and was able to ask just what had occurred moments earlier			1
" my brother can afford this and the way you 're treating him shows that you think just because he 's black , he ca n't afford this watch , " said the sibling			0
@entity0 then takes up the story , saying the lady in the store said she was wary of him because " we had some @entity65 in the store the other day who came with fake credit cards			1
" " if one of my own makes a mistake , they judge us all			0
tomorrow , if a white man in @entity12 makes a mistake , we should judge all white people ? no ! " the security guard from @entity77 kept trying to justify what the lady said and i asked him where he 's from			0
when he told me , i said , ' ahh			0
if i gave you my name , you will recognize who i am ? ' " he shrugged and i said , ' i 'm @entity0			1
' he went , ' nooooo ! just yesterday , my wife and i were talking about you ! can i take a picture with you and send it to my wife ? ' " i said , ' yes , we can take a picture , but you made a mistake because you ca n't judge people by the color of their skin , ' so he told me it was n't because of our color			0
" i told the lady , ' in my next interview , i 'm going to tell them about this and i 'll name the store so everyone can know that you treat people differently here , ' added @entity0 referring to the saleswoman			1
" she then realized that i could have reported what she had just done , but it was a mistake			0
it was a mistake of her to categorize			0
" i do n't think she 's a racist person , but she stereotyped all black people as ' those people '			0
" @entity0 tells this story to demonstrate his belief that racism is not just football 's problem but one that society as a whole must combat			1
the @entity9 international has played across the world in @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 as well as a spell in @entity123 with @entity124			1
he says he has experienced racism on and off the field , most famously during his time playing for @entity127			2
in 2006 , during a game against @entity129 , @entity0 was subjected to " monkey chants " -- and the forward came close to walking off the pitch			1
he says it was only because of persuasion by his teammate @entity135 that he stayed on and helped his side to a 2 - 0 victory			0
in 2010 , while playing for @entity138 at @entity139 , @entity0 was again subjected to racist chanting which caused a three - minute stoppage to the contest			1
the referee addressed both captains while a message was also broadcast inside the stadium warning supporters the game would be abandoned if the chanting did not stop			0
@entity0 went on to score the only goal of the game as @entity138 triumphed 1 - 0			1
" you have to understand that football is just a reflection of what we have in society , " said @entity0			1
" it 's not that football is here and society is here -- no , it 's a reflection of what goes on in society			2
" football is a great opportunity for certain people , who sometimes think they 're better than you or different than others , to express their views as right ... or as a chance to hurt other people			2
" the first time i experienced racism was n't on a football pitch , but the truth is that i never thought that that could happen to me on a football pitch because football is a passion , it 's a feeling that touches millions of people			1
" sometimes , the fact that you 're a footballer makes you think that racism ca n't happen to you because you bring that passion and you express a lot of things			2
" when it happened to me , i could n't believe it and in that moment , i decided to walk off the pitch			0
" @entity0 , now 34 , believes there has been progress within the game in recent years and has decided that it is safe enough for his children to return to stadiums			1
in 2007 , he said he did not want his kids having to watch him being booed and subjected to racist abuse			0
" i said that back then because racist incidents almost seemed to be fashionable , " @entity0 explains			2
" when you arrive at a football ground , this is going to happen -- when there 's a black player , this will happen			2
" in that moment , i said , ' no , my kids are n't going to go and see that because it will be very difficult to explain			0
' " if you tell a child , go to the right and you 'll get a reward , he 'll always go to the right because he wants the reward			0
a child comes to see his father play , have fun , make people happy and what does he see ? " he sees people booing his father for being black , they make monkey noises , they throw bananas at his teammates and all that			0
" but we see more and more that authorities are fighting , people are increasingly against what happens in football grounds and in society is getting better			2
" @entity0 was presented with the @entity225 from the @entity226 following a ceremony in @entity4 earlier this week			2
for a man who has won three @entity230 titles , his assertion that this particular award is his " biggest " gives an insight into @entity0 's mindset in dealing with the scourge of racism			1
" it 's the most important , " @entity0 said of the award			1
" it 's something that affects us all and to recognize the little work that i 've done , the truth is that i 'm very , very happy because you can win the @entity230 , you can win championships , you can score goals , but to represent a fight that affects millions and millions of people ... it 's one of a kind			0
" @entity0 also defended @entity123 's record of dealing with racism , despite @entity250 , the sport 's world governing body , expressing its concerns over how the country 's authorities deal with the problem			1
according to a report published earlier this month by the fare network , an anti-racism body , and the @entity261 , which conducts research on nationalism and racism , there were more than 200 cases of discriminatory behavior within the @entity123 game over two seasons			1
the fans of @entity269 , one of @entity123 's most famous clubs have been serial offenders in terms of racism with @entity274 , the game 's @entity275 governing body , handing out punishments on numerous occasions			1
yet , @entity0 , now playing in @entity120 with @entity279 , retains fond memories of @entity123			1
the four - time @entity281 joined @entity124 in 2011 following a deal which made him the highest paid player in the world on a reported salary of $ 13 million a year			0
he scored 36 goals in 71 appearances before joining @entity43 in 2013 -- but he rejects any suggestions that @entity123 is a hotbed for racism ahead of the 2018 @entity291			1
" at the @entity291 in @entity123 , you 'll see that there wo n't be incidents like this , " he added			1
" i hope there are n't because i 've played there and i had a great time there and i know the efforts that the @entity123 are making to try to improve certain things that have happened there , and we have to support these efforts			2
football is beautiful because whether you win , draw or lose , you can go and shake your opponent 's hand whether they 're white or black or red or blue			2
this is where football wins , but when there are incidents like this , it 's shameful , but it does n't mean this will happen in the @entity291 just because it 's in @entity123			1
" i was there and i lived a beautiful experience			0
