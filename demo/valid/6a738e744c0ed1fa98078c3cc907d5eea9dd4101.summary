@entity1 @entity1 teenager @entity0 only converted to @entity3 in april last year			1
but by august he was arrested on suspicion of plotting to kill a soldier , police officer or government official , with a 12 - inch knife and a hammer found in his backpack			1
@entity0 was convicted in february of " engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts " and sentenced friday at the @entity14 to 22 years in prison			1
it 's a case with chilling echoes of the shocking murder by two @entity20 extremists of soldier @entity21 , mowed down and hacked to death with a machete on a street in @entity25 , in southeast @entity1 , in may 2013			2
on the morning of his arrest , @entity0 had told his former girlfriend he intended to attack and kill soldiers			1
he also showed her the long - bladed knife and the hammer in his bag			2
police who had searched his home two months previously had found a handwritten letter in which he glorified the murder of @entity21 , and stated that " we should do a 9/11 , 7/7 and a @entity25 all in one day			2
" police said @entity0 , who was unemployed , had come under the influence of a banned @entity1 - based terrorist organization " that it is believed played a major role in influencing and shaping his radical views			1
" that organization is @entity45 , also known as @entity46 handing down the 22 - year sentence , judge @entity47 said the police had put together a " formidable and unassailable " case against the teenager			2
" @entity0 's coldblooded deliberation under the malign influence of @entity46 , of whom he was a willing student , showed in court that he was far from the naive adolescent that the ( defense ) tried to portray him as , " he is quoted as saying in a police statement			1
" he is a man of intelligence and independent and articulate mind			0
he was within hours of carrying out his intention of murdering a soldier , police officer or government official to imitate the horrifying savagery carried out by the killers of @entity21			1
" the letter that came to light when counterterror officers from @entity1 's @entity71 searched @entity0 's address in june gave an insight into an extremist mind - set that already had violence in mind			1
found in a pair of jeans , according to police , the letter was messily written with many misspellings			0
in it , he tells his " beloved parents " that what he 's about to do is an obligation for @entity84 and asks them to forgive him for all the stress he 's caused them in the past			0
" i 'm a changed person , " he said , saying he has to act to help his " brothers and sisters " in @entity90 and @entity91			0
because he does not have the means to get to these countries , he will wage war against the @entity98 government here instead , he said , adding that it would give the authorities " a taste of there ( sic ) own medicine			0
" @entity0 admitted writing the letter and was arrested on suspicion of committing a terrorism offense			1
he was released on bail , allowing police to continue their inquiries			0
police believe he converted to @entity3 in april 2014 and point to his postings on social media as evidence of his rapid radicalization			0
in may he posted " land of democracy = @entity118 , " and in july he posted , " forget the protests , the only way to liberate @entity84 lands is @entity115			0
" on june 20 , @entity0 had used his phone to visit websites researching the locations for army cadet bases across @entity1 , police said			1
while @entity0 was out on bail , officers tasked with trying to divert vulnerable young people from the path to radicalization tried to meet with him three times , but he declined to engage with them , police said			2
commander @entity129 of the @entity130 welcomed the sentence , saying he was " relieved an extremely dangerous individual " had been removed from the streets			0
" @entity0 was an impressionable young man who became radicalized , then rapidly developed an extremist , violent mind - set , " @entity129 said			0
the work of police and intelligence officials had " probably prevented a horrific terrorist attack taking place on the streets of @entity1 , " he said .			0
