@entity0 , @entity1 @entity1 forces are doubling down efforts to retake the city of @entity6 from @entity7 , even uniting @entity9 and @entity10 fighters in the mission			1
the @entity1 army , along with @entity9 and @entity10 militiamen , attacked @entity7 strongholds in the area monday , the state - run @entity12 reported			1
@entity1 warplanes and helicopters are also striking targets in and around @entity6			1
it 's part of a wide - scale offensive ordered by @entity1 prime minister @entity23 on sunday			2
@entity6 fell to @entity7 in june of 2014 , after the group 's capture of @entity1 's second - largest city , @entity27			1
@entity6 is best known to @entity28 as the birthplace of former @entity1 dictator @entity30			1
@entity7 , the radical @entity9 militant group , has been on a murderous campaign to establish a caliphate across swaths of @entity1 and @entity34			1
@entity1 forces approached @entity6 from several fronts , @entity12 reported , engaging with @entity7 north of the city at @entity38 and south of the city at @entity41			1
the element of surprise probably was not a factor , as reports of @entity1 troops amassing near @entity6 were widely shared			1
what awaits the @entity1 army is most likely a long , hard slog and not a quick rout			2
@entity6 is a big city , and the army and its associated militias have had problems recapturing much smaller towns from @entity7			1
there have been several failed attempts to recapture @entity6 since the second half of 2014			2
while @entity1 forces have gained some territory in the area , it has generally been under @entity7 control for the last eight months or so			1
the joint @entity1 forces fighting to retake @entity6 include @entity1 troops , members of the @entity66 militia , members of the @entity69 brigades , and other @entity9 tribal fighters			1
the offensive involves around 30,000 fighters in all			0
@entity73 , who is also commander in chief of the armed forces , said on @entity75 that he will " oversee the operation to liberate @entity6 " from @entity7			1
in short , this is the biggest test for an army trying to claw back territory that fell to @entity7 last summer after a string of dramatic defeats			0
last june , @entity6 was the scene of the bloodiest massacre ever perpetrated by @entity7 militants			1
they captured more than a thousand @entity1 soldiers , who laid down their arms and donned civilian clothing in an attempt to flee a base once used by @entity92 forces			0
@entity7 subsequently executed as many as 1,700 soldiers , and posted the video of the killing online			0
there is concern that @entity1 forces , eager for revenge , may kill combatants and civilians alike			0
the @entity101 's envoy to @entity1 , @entity100 , urged all armed forces in @entity6 to do their utmost to spare civilians			1
@entity92 and other coalition troops have been conducting a crash course to retrain and upgrade the @entity1 army , and several thousand @entity1 troops have passed through the course			0
this offensive will tell whether that training has made a difference			0
the offensive also highlights the role played by neighboring @entity115 in the fight against @entity7			2
the semiofficial @entity115 @entity118 news agency reports that @entity119 , the commander of the elite @entity115 @entity120 , is helping oversee the operation to retake @entity6			0
@entity115 has provided advisers , weapons and ammunition to the @entity1 government			0
if the offensive succeeds , it means that retaking @entity27 , a city 10 times bigger , is possible			0
but @entity6 is almost 200 kilometers ( 124 miles ) south of @entity27 , and much of the territory in between is under @entity7 control			2
@entity73 has said the immediate goal is to liberate @entity135 ad - @entity133 province , of which @entity6 is the capital , and then focus on adjacent @entity132 , a similarly @entity9 - dominated province			0
after that , retaking @entity27 is an option			0
if , however , the @entity6 offensive fails , it could spell disaster for @entity141			2
there will be political recriminations , the already fragile morale of the @entity1 army could collapse , the @entity147 autonomous region could decide to break from @entity1 , and it would provide @entity7 with a victory it has n't seen since last summer			2
@entity149 reported from @entity0 , and @entity150 reported from @entity151			0
@entity2 's @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 stages an offensive against @entity7 in @entity6
@entity7 has generally controlled @entity6 since 2014
