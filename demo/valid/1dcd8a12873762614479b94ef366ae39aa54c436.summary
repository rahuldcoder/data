@entity1 's tourism industry has been thrown into disarray by a terror attack on wednesday that left at least 17 foreign visitors dead and prompted urgent warnings over security			1
only just recovering from the impact of the @entity10 uprisings four years ago , @entity1 has once again emerged as a winter sun draw for tens of thousands of travelers			1
but following wednesday 's attack and siege at the prestigious @entity17 in central @entity18 , the country 's tourism industry is once again facing jeopardy even as authorities and operators scramble to ensure the safety of visitors currently in the country			2
a significant number of foreign tourists were inside the museum at the time of the attack , which government officials said was the work of " islamists			2
" prime minister @entity33 said @entity34 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 tourists are among those killed , with another 20 tourists plus two @entity1 wounded in the attack			1
@entity41 said its ship , @entity43 , is currently docked in the @entity18 port of @entity45 and some of its passengers had been on tours of the city , including the @entity50 at the time of the attack			0
" all the tourist coaches on tour were immediately recalled to the port and all other tours on the ground were immediately suspended , " @entity43 said in a statement			0
another ship , the @entity59 , docked in @entity18 at that time , has a manifest of more than 3,000 passengers , its parent company @entity57 said			0
as details of the incident emerged , several foreign governments put out warnings urging their citizens to stay away from the scene of the attacks , around an area that includes the national parliament building			1
the @entity72 @entity71 in @entity18 issued an alert that also reiterated standing advice about the potential for violence in @entity1 and the risk of kidnappings			1
its warning cautions against trips to @entity1 's central , southern and border regions			1
@entity83 's @entity82 ( @entity82 ) also urged @entity83 citizens to stay away from the affected areas of @entity18 and to " follow the instructions of @entity1 security authorities			1
" its warning also carried longstanding advice : " there is a high threat from terrorism , including kidnapping			0
attacks could be indiscriminate , including places visited by foreigners			0
" with tens of thousands of foreign visitors likely to be in @entity1 right now and many more contemplating travel there , travel operators have been rushing to formulate a response to the attack			1
it 's not immediately known if flights will be added to accommodate any sudden surge in departures or whether tour operators will pull out of the country -- responses that followed a terror attack in @entity109 last year			0
@entity110 and @entity111 , a @entity83 - based travel operator that carries thousands of vacationers on package trips to @entity1 , said it had canceled organized excursions to @entity18 as a precaution			1
a statement said it would follow @entity82 advice , which overall remained unchanged for @entity1			0
" @entity110 and @entity111 customers stay in beach destinations , not @entity18 , and we can confirm that none of our customers or staff were affected by the incident that took place there today , " it said			0
" as a precaution however we have canceled excursions to @entity18 for the coming days			0
" customer safety is of paramount importance to us and we continue to work closely with the @entity82 and the @entity83 consulate to monitor the situation			0
@entity1 remains a popular destination for us and customers are enjoying their holidays as normal			0
" in its advisory , the @entity83 @entity82 points out " 424,707 @entity83 nationals visited @entity1 in 2014			1
most @entity83 tourists stay in the coastal resorts and most visits are trouble free			2
" indeed , @entity1 's largely unsullied reputation as a safe north @entity144 destination for @entity145 seeking low coast beach breaks has clawed back some of the popularity it enjoyed before 2011			1
in 2010 , the country welcomed 6.9 million tourists to its beach resorts and numerous historic sites			0
in 2011 , the year in which an uprising ousted longtime president @entity156 @entity155 -- an event credited with triggering the @entity10 -- that number fell below 4.8 million			2
with calm restored in recent years -- despite security concerns from neighboring @entity161 and ongoing political tensions -- those numbers have been on the rise , helped by costly advertising campaigns			1
recently reported statistics put visitor numbers still 10 % lower than their pre- 2011 levels , but numbers had been expected to rise again -- particularly with a new " @entity170 " film renewing interest in the country 's role as a key location in the original movies			2
in a 2013 interview , @entity1 tourism minister @entity177 said up to 20 % of @entity1 's population -- equivalent to 2 million people -- relied on the tourism industry			1
he told the @entity182 he was optimistic that visitor numbers would continue to grow			0
" the sector has big potential and we aim to reach 10 million tourists by 2016 , a growth of one million tourists per year , " he said			0
" @entity1 also has more freedom and democracy now , which is very important for economic growth and prosperity and has a positive effect on the tourism industry			2
