@entity1 , @entity2 @entity0 cared for her old car as a sentimental possession , missing a tire while parked beside her home , until one day the city ticketed her for having a " derelict vehicle in driveway			1
" a tow truck took it away in 2009			0
so began an odyssey with @entity1 police , municipal court and city hall that left her with $ 1,200 in fines that to this day she still does n't fully understand			1
she paid the sum because endless court hearings about the car wore her down			2
" i do n't have a lawyer			0
i 'm not a lawyer			0
it 's me going up against the city of @entity1 when the attorneys wo n't help , " @entity0 said this week			1
she never saw again her 1996 @entity27 with 168,000 miles			0
its location is a mystery			0
she accepts the loss because at least she 's not in jail , where city authorities threatened to put her at one point , she said			2
while @entity0 's surrender of both car and $ 1,200 to the city may seem a matter of personal choice , the @entity35 revealed this week a " pattern and practice " of racial discrimination within @entity1 that may lend credibility to @entity0 's account of a government run amok			1
just about every branch of @entity1 government -- police , municipal court , city hall -- participated in " unlawful " targeting of @entity53 residents such as @entity0 for tickets and fines , the @entity35 concluded this week			1
the millions of dollars in fines and fees paid by black residents served an ultimate goal of satisfying " revenue rather than public safety needs , " the @entity35 found			2
to the outside world , the federal findings were staggering , but to @entity0 and other longtime residents , the conclusion was nothing new			1
they 've felt it all along , they say			0
it 's only now that federal authorities have documented the institutionalized racism , as part of a civil rights investigation after a white police officer 's fatal shooting of an unarmed black teen , @entity76 , 19 , last summer			0
the officer , @entity77 , was cleared of federal civil rights violations this week and was earlier cleared of criminal wrongdoing			0
the @entity35 is expected to pursue a court - supervised consent decree that requires the city of @entity1 to make changes to its police and courts			1
" it 's definitely a vicious cycle , " said @entity0 , 64 , a retired airline reservation agent			1
" unfortunately for most people who are in this cycle , they continue to be in a downward spiral because they ca n't get jobs , they ca n't do anything , they ca n't pay the fines			2
" @entity0 's household has experienced its share of ugly encounters with @entity1 police , the family said			1
@entity0 's daughter was ticketed by police in what she described as racial profiling , she said			1
in 2007 , @entity104 got a $ 124 ticket for driving her sister 's car , which was n't insured in @entity2 , and then had to pay an additional $ 100 fine when she missed a court appearance because of an emergency appendectomy			1
the court , she said , rejected her medical excuse and issued a warrant for her arrest			0
she paid a total of $ 224 in fines because she was in the middle of a job search and did n't want an outstanding warrant to prevent her from getting a good job			1
" why is it that all the people in court are black ? " @entity104 said of defendants in municipal court			0
" i 've had so many police officers make a u-turn , follow me , run my plates , find out everything is ok , then turn around and go back in the direction they were going			0
" there 's nothing we can do			0
in @entity1 , the police do what they want to do			1
@entity1 does what it wants , " said @entity104 , 35 , who now works the overnight shift on a @entity138 manufacturing line			1
city officials and police declined to respond to @entity3 's requests this week for comment about the @entity0 family 's assertions			1
last september , the @entity148 repealed administrative fees imposed by police when overseeing the release of a towed vehicle , the mayor said			2
the city also no longer has a specific offense for failing to appear in court , which eliminates certain additional fees and court costs , the mayor said			1
the @entity35 's report details how @entity1 operated a vertically integrated system -- from street cop to court clerk to judge to city administration to city council -- to raise revenue for the city budget through increased ticketing and fining			1
@entity1 's budget increases were so sizable that city officials exhorted police and court staff to levy more and more fines and tickets against violators , who turned out to be largely @entity53 , the @entity35 said			1
the demands for revenue were so intense that the police department had " little concern with how officers do this , " even disciplining officers who failed to issue an average of 28 tickets a month , the @entity35 report said			0
officers competed " to see who could issue the largest number of citations during a single stop , " the @entity35 said			0
one apparent winner was an officer who issued 14 tickets at a single encounter , according to the federal investigation report			0
many police stops of civilians " have little relation to public safety and a questionable basis in law , " the report said			0
@entity1 police chief mum on federal report indeed , @entity1 enjoyed so much success in issuing tickets and fines that @entity1 , population 21,000 , was ranked in the top eight of the 80 municipal courts in @entity210 by having more than $ 1 million in revenue in 2010 , the report said			1
when @entity1 court revenues exceeded $ 2 million in 2012 , the city manager responded to the police chief in an internal email : " awesome ! thanks ! " according to the federal report			1
even municipal judges were pressured to boost revenue			0
" the city has made clear to the police chief and the municipal judge that revenue generation must also be a priority in court operations , " the federal investigation found			2
the city finance director said in a 2011 report that the municipal judge had been successful since 2003 in increasing court collections , and that internal 2011 city report noted a judge 's statement that " none of these changes could have taken place without the cooperation of the court clerk , the chief of police , and the prosecutor 's office , " the @entity35 investigation found			2
cash filled the city treasury			2
by 2013 , revenue from enforcing municipal codes reached $ 2.46 million , the federal report said			2
by 2015 , the city anticipated that fines and fees would account for 23 % of the budget , or $ 3.09 million of $ 13.26 million in general fund expenses , the @entity35 found			1
just five years earlier , court fines and fees made up only 12 % of the budget , or $ 1.38 million of $ 11.07 million in general fund revenues , the @entity35 found			2
the fines were among the highest of surrounding municipalities			2
for example , area parking fines ranged from $ 5 to $ 100 , but @entity1 's parking fine was $ 102			1
a fine for " weeds / tall grass " was $ 5 in one nearby city , but @entity1 's fine ranged from $ 77 to $ 102 , the @entity35 found			1
the federal government made a forceful conclusion : " @entity148 , police and court officials for years have worked in concert to maximize revenue at every stage of the enforcement process , beginning with how fines and fine enforcement processes are established , " the federal report said			0
after the @entity35 's announcement this week , @entity1 mayor @entity276 told reporters that he , police chief @entity279 and city attorney @entity280 met with federal officials about their findings and initiated several initiatives , including reforms to the municipal court			1
@entity276 said municipal judges have created a docket for alleged offenders having trouble paying fines			2
also , a defendant may ask a judge or prosecutor about different payment plans or alternative sentencing , the mayor said			0
defendants have been required to pay an entire fine at once , regardless of ability to pay , the federal report said			0
the city also passed an ordinance last september to cap municipal court revenues at 15 % of the city 's overall budget , the mayor said			2
that figure is half @entity2 's legal limit , he added			0
all the reforms are intended to " move this city , its residents and our entire community forward , " the mayor said			1
back at her home , @entity0 recalled the height of absurdity in her fight against the city , which occurred shortly after her husband , @entity320 , died in 2008 of complications from paralysis he suffered in a car accident three years earlier			1
she had been his caregiver			0
she appeared in court to appeal the citation , but an officer arrested her and put her in the back of the squad car			0
her offense ? failing to appear in court , she said			0
she spent four hours in jail			0
she insists she made every court date			0
for now , she lives in fear of the police , even at home			0
" we just got to a point where we said we 're just not going to have anyone over -- because they were fearful when they left they would get some ticket , and they did n't even live here , " @entity0 said			1
@entity3 's @entity348 and @entity349 contributed from @entity1			2
@entity350 reported and wrote this story from @entity352 .			0

@entity0 gave up fighting the city , paying $ 1,200 in fines over a broken - down car
