there 's been plenty of talk lately about how dangerous stereotypes can be when it comes to the empowerment of our girls and young women			1
for instance , the @entity11 campaign , which took a hammer to the notion that doing anything " like a girl " should be viewed as an insult , has become an international sensation			0
less discussed , though , is the reality that our boys face damaging stereotypes too			1
that was the motivation behind a recent workshop held by @entity25 , a leading women 's lifestyle media company			1
a group of @entity29 tween boys ranging in age from 8 to 10 got together as part of the company 's @entity33 program , which focuses on teaching digital literacy and citizenship to the next generation			1
the boys were shown dozens of advertisements perpetuating hypermasculine stereotypes , such as images of men all muscled up and not wearing shirts			1
in one ad for a big truck , the boys heard the tag line " can a truck change how people feel about a guy ? " is the ' be a man ' stereotype hurting boys ? another advertisement , this one for a clothing company , showed a man from the waist down along with the caption " wear the pants			2
" " that 's a man wearing the pants so that shows that men are in charge , " said one of the boys , who 's 9			1
what was clear was that this group of boys knew what the advertisers were trying to get them to think , but they were n't exactly buying it			2
" i play with girl toys and boy toys			0
i do n't really care which one is meant for boys or for girls			2
i just play with them			0
they 're toys , " said another boy , also 9			0
" man up " might mean toughen up and be unemotional , said another boy , who added that his image of what a man should be is completely different			2
" if i were to describe the perfect man , the words would be smart , not judgy , and kind , " said the 10 - year - old			2
' @entity91 ' gets a makeover in @entity94 ads these boys certainly ca n't speak for all tween boys , but their comments reflect what appears to be growing attention surrounding the use of gender stereotypes for boys as well as girls			1
seventy - six percent of men who took part in a recent online survey by @entity25 admitted using phrases like " man up " and " be a man " toward boys			1
of the more than 1200 men and women surveyed from across the country , 73 % said boys are most often described as " aggressive , " 69 % said " strong " and 53 % said " athletic			1
" when the men were asked about stereotypes during their teen years , 72 % said they became aware of physical attractiveness and 50 % said they grew more conscious about weight			1
kids as young as 5 concerned about body image the awareness starts even earlier , according to a recent analysis of existing research on kids and body image by @entity128 , a child advocacy group			2
it found that over a third of boys ages 6 to 8 think their ideal weight should be thinner than their current body weight			2
" these are problems that are often thought of as problems for girls , but boys are just as impacted and they 're exposed to unrealistic body images , " said @entity136 , vice president of marketing for @entity128 , which is partnering with @entity25 to help parents understand the impact that media and technology are having on children			1
" the proportion of undressed males in advertising has been steadily on the rise since the 1980s , " said @entity136			0
" the same kinds of inappropriate messages that we 're giving to our girls , we 're giving to our boys too -- that they do n't measure up , that they 're not adequate			0
" at the same time , there does appear to be more open - mindedness on what being masculine means to men and boys today , based on the poll 's findings			1
of the men surveyed by @entity25 , 78 % said it was ok for boys to cry , 65 % thought it was fine for boys to wear pink , and 55 % of men said boys should be able to play dress - up			1
" you should be able to do your own things and do what you want , " said one of the boys , who is 8			0
@entity180 teams up with the @entity181 to get men to lean in the takeaway for parents is that they , more than anyone or anything else , influence the stereotypes their boys will encounter and what impact those stereotypes will ultimately have on them			1
" we found the single most significant driver of their perception of what 's ok for boys was their parents , " said @entity191 , chief marketing officer for @entity25			1
" it was n't pop culture or @entity201 or @entity202			0
it was their parents , " she said			0
" if their parents think they 're strong and appropriately masculine , then they are			0
" pack , of @entity128 , says parents should be talking about the issue to their boys when they are young , even as young as 5 , and should call out stereotypes when they see them			2
" do n't just turn your eyes			0
use it as an opportunity to engage in a conversation with your kids and challenge assumptions , " @entity136 said			0
" when you are seeing things on tv that you think are unrealistic , point it out			0
" i , for one , wish we could wipe out " be a man " and " man up " from all of our vocabularies			0
but , actually , why do we need to remove the language ? we just need to change what it means			0
the tweens involved in the @entity33 workshop offer some real - life evidence that that may be already happening			0
" when you go your own way , it feels good because you feel free and you can do what you want to do , and you do n't have to do what other people say , " one of the boys said			0
what do you think is the best way to empower boys and young men to tune out negative gender stereotypes ? share your thoughts with @entity247 on @entity248 @ kellywallacetv or @entity250 on @entity251 .			1
