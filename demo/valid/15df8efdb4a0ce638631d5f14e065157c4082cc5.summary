it should n't come as a surprise that @entity3 has collapsed -- again			0
a country that has split and been pulled together before , has the youngest and fastest growing population in the region , is running low on oil and water , and possesses a " personalist " government rather than stable institutions , was on the top of every expert 's list as the fragile state most likely to fail next			2
what is surprising is that @entity17 policy ignored all of this and proceeded on the premise that simply drone - bombing @entity22 terrorists could keep @entity3 intact and stable			1
indeed , last fall , when president @entity24 pointed to @entity17 policy in @entity3 as an example of a " success " and a model for the plans that would roll back the @entity29 ( also known as @entity30 ) , i shivered			1
for as september ended , @entity33 @entity32 rebels from the north moved south and took the capital city , @entity36			0
by january , the @entity29 was noticeably increasing its recruitment in @entity3 , and that same month the @entity3 - based @entity38 claimed responsibility for organizing the deadly @entity41 attacks in @entity42			0
last week , the @entity29 bombed two @entity33 mosques in @entity3 , killing more than 130 worshippers at prayer			0
this week , the @entity32 forces are closing in on @entity3 's second major city , @entity49 , on the south coast , and the @entity17 - supported president , @entity46 , has reportedly fled the country			1
as the @entity17 has closed its embassy and withdrawn its last troops , @entity3 has slid into total chaos , with rebels and jihadists on both sides capturing military bases and seizing tanks and heavy weapons			2
the situation is so dire that a coalition of @entity65 nations , led by @entity66 , has launched massive airstrikes against the @entity32 , with a @entity66 adviser threatening to bring up to 150,000 ground troops into @entity3 to restore the @entity46 regime			0
@entity3 does have value as a lesson -- this is what happens when you ignore the basic foundations of social stability			1
these include legitimate leadership with stable succession plans ; a united elite ; institutions to bridge regional and ethnic divisions and assure fairness in political and economic access and a functioning economy with capabilities for providing employment and growth			0
rather than working to secure these things , the @entity17 administration has succumbed to the illusion that precision bombing or other surgical interventions to remove " dangerous elements " will sustain broader social and political stability			1
anyone could see that the conditions for collapse were progressing in @entity3 and that aerial attacks on @entity22 terrorists would have no effect on them			1
those attacks were a sideshow -- like firing a lousy band performing on the deck of an ocean liner , while a hull full of holes is taking on water fast			0
what we have now is an area with about 24 million people , more than twice the population now under the rule of the @entity29 in eastern @entity116 and western @entity117 , that is virtually ungoverned and up for grabs and is falling into the grips of an all - out civil war between @entity123 - supported shi'as and @entity22 / @entity30 - aligned @entity65			1
it is a war that the @entity125 loses no matter who wins			0
it is now too late to do much of anything except watch and try to either support any moderate elements if they should emerge as capable of holding regional or national power , or contain any dangerous jihadist elements if they should do so			2
either task will be difficult , and provide yet another costly distraction to efforts to restore peace in @entity116 and @entity117			0
in other words , what has happened in @entity3 , although predictable , is about the worst outcome imaginable for @entity17 policy			1
that @entity17 ever deluded itself into thinking airstrikes were enough to deal with the problems of failing states in the @entity145 and @entity146 -- and the crisis of @entity30 -- is a notion that could only be made more frightening if it keeps on doing it .			2

@entity152 : @entity17 policy of drone - bombing @entity22 terrorists ignores need to build social stability
he says country now in chaos , virtually ungoverned and *vulnerable* to jihadist elements
