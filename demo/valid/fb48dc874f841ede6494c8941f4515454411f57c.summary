even the 3 - year - old playing with your @entity3 could tell you that			1
but what would the digital world look like through a different sort of frame ? say ... a circular one ? @entity10 , a startup based in @entity12 , @entity13 , was founded around this very idea			1
for the last year , the three - person team has been working a circular , palm - sized device dubbed @entity17			1
they cheekily refer to it as the " anti-smartphone , " a description that goes for both its form factor and its value system			1
the round device is meant to be the antidote to our feed - obsessed , notification - saturated digital existence			1
it 's a challenge to the rectangular status quo and everything it represents			1
that 's a quixotic dream , but an interesting one			1
display technologies have a long and rectangular history			1
before smartphones there were movie screens , tvs , and computers , not to mention paintings and pages of print			1
and then of course there are windows — in some ways the original glass rectangles			1
in each case , the rectangle 's prominence can be attributed in large part to practicality			1
whether you 're talking about film or glass or stone , rectangles are easy to make			1
they do n't leave much wasted material			1
as frames for shaping the world , however , different types of rectangles can produce vastly different effects			1
14 of the @entity63 in her book @entity66 , which traces the rectangular frame from @entity69 painting up through @entity70 , media theorist @entity64 offers an example from the history of architecture , centering on a public feud between @entity78 builder @entity76 and the preeminent modernist architect @entity79			1
@entity76 was a strong advocate of the traditional @entity78 casement window , which was oriented vertically			1
its main function , he said , was to let light into a room			1
@entity79 , making use of new manufacturing techniques , designed his buildings around long , horizontal windows , which were as much about framing the outside world as illuminating the space within			2
the disagreement influenced architecture for decades to come			2
the simple act of turning a rectangle on its side gave us entirely new ways to think about space			2
rectangles are still subtly dictating our behavior today			2
movie screens , chased by @entity102 , have gotten bigger and wider , encouraging us to sit back and lose ourselves in the spectacle			2
( in 1930 , @entity105 filmmaker @entity104 lamented how the cinema 's " passive horizontalism			2
" he wanted the screen to be square			2
) smartphones , with their slender , touch - controlled displays , have become a distinctly more active rectangle			2
paired with the never - ending vertical feeds that fill apps like @entity117 , @entity118 , and @entity119 , they 've become an irresistible , inexhaustible diversion			2
the point is this : frames matter			2
they suggest certain things about how we should approach them			2
they shape the type of stuff that 's made for them			2
and if just turning a rectangle on its side can make such a big difference , imagine all the interesting things that might happen if you left the rectangle behind altogether			2
@entity17 is n't meant to be a smartphone replacement so much as an alternative			1
" i think we 've become really , really good at getting interrupted and creating conduits for interruption , " says @entity10 ceo @entity137 , who met his co-founders during a stint at @entity140			2
" it 's time now to use technology to get a little quieter			2
" if miniaturizing the computer is what got us the smartphone , @entity17 asks what a gizmo might look like if you started by souping up a pocket watch			1
and the shape of the device is central to that thinking			2
a circular frame , after all , is no good for browsing a @entity119 feed			1
12 @entity158 so what is it good for ? that 's the question			0
at this point , @entity17 as much a provocation as an actual product			1
the three - person team , which has been working with the @entity167 design studio @entity166 on the concept for nearly a year , has some prototype hardware and a crude sketch of an operating system , but they 've still got a long way to go			0
they 've got a few vague ideas for applications			0
one is a sort of dashboard that gives you an overview of activity on your social media accounts			0
another is a compass - style mapping system that encourages wandering instead of pure @entity185 - b efficiency			0
but they 're more enthusiastic about the philosophy behind it all : they want to see applications that distill information and streamline interaction , software that constrains the smartphone experience as it exists today			1
all this is easier said than done , of course			0
throwing out centuries of rectangular thinking and starting from scratch ai n't easy			0
plus , it 's not clear that people really want constraint to begin with			0
smartphones are distracting , sure , but they 're also incredibly useful and immensely entertaining and maybe a little distraction is a fair price to pay for all the good stuff			0
still , even as a hint of a possible device , @entity17 is compelling			1
for one thing , the company 's hardware model feels great in the hand ( the team 's hardware guy , @entity213 , came from @entity215 , where he helped design the @entity216			0
) the model 's curved back brings to mind the very first @entity219 — and makes you consider how each successive generation has become a little bit harder to hold			0
and though unformed , the vision for the software is interesting too			0
if today 's interactive rectangles and infinite feeds signal that there 's always more stuff just outside the frame , circles could offer something more self - contained , more complete			0
maybe even something actively inefficient			0
rectangles are beautiful and functional			0
a circular device would sever the link to the printed page , the tv and the computer , and invite developers to look elsewhere for metaphor and inspiration			1
peep holes , port holes , and wormholes			0
@entity250 , buttons , and other circular controls			1
15 incredible photos that 'll remind you to be awed by @entity255 if nothing else , the concept could be valuable simply for helping us identify some of the assumptions and habits that underlie our existing devices			1
maybe thinking about circles could help us make our rectangles better			0
@entity17 is just one scrappy , literal attempt to abandon the rectangle			1
but similar thinking is happening elsewhere			0
@entity267 , @entity269 's smartwatch operating system , reconsiders what apps should look like on a tiny circular display			1
@entity273 is in some ways another rectangle , but its real estate is limited enough that it will also encourage new , less rectangular thinking			0
( note how its home screen ditches @entity219 's grid of icons for a blob of circular ones			1
also note the recent rise of circular avatars over the traditional square ones in apps and interfaces of all kinds )			1
we 've seen how sensors can be harnessed to choreograph experiences that happen outside of the frame entirely , as with @entity294 's @entity293 , which usher you through the company 's parks			0
and then of course there are technologies like augmented reality and virtual reality , where your nose is effectively pressed so close to the glass that the frame disappears entirely			0
here , the screen is less of a window , more of a lens			0
the only frame is your field of vision			0
they 're easy , they 're efficient			0
but as new components and manufacturing techniques make it easier to experiment with other forms , we 'll likely find people exploring the unique effects they can produce			0
just recently , in fact , we saw an instance of a tech industry giant leaving the glass rectangle behind in a very big way			0
in a 10 minute video , @entity269 proposed a new headquarters that would leaves boxy buildings behind in favor of tent - like structures draped in glass			0
these buildings do n't have vertical windows or horizontal windows			0
they 're nothing but windows , or maybe they 're so radical that the concept of " window " does n't even really apply			0
whatever the case , there 's nothing rectangular about them , and @entity269 's convinced they 're the future			0
read more from @entity0 : there 's a @entity350 for boarding planes , but airlines are n't using it 21 awesomely well - designed products we 're dying to @entity355 what cities would look like if @entity357 only by the @entity358 subscribe to @entity0 for less than $ 1 an issue and get a free gift ! click here ! copyright 2011 @entity362 .			0

a @entity13 startup has developed a circular smartphone called " @entity17 "
the provocative *anti-phone* is meant to be an antidote to our obsession for digital devices
