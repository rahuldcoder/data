the world is watching for what could turn out to be either a historic achievement for international diplomacy -- or , just as easily , a disappointing failure -- as negotiators sit down this week in the tranquil lakeside city of @entity8 , @entity9 , to hammer out a framework nuclear deal with @entity11 before march 31			1
here are some of the key things you need to know as the next major deadline approaches in the @entity11 nuclear talks : 1			2
the road to @entity8 has been a long one			0
this latest round of talks are part of a process that has been going on for two years , through both public and private diplomatic channels			0
in 2013 , tensions between the world powers and @entity11 began to thaw a bit after the election of reformist @entity11 president @entity27 , who pledged to end the crippling weight of international sanctions on @entity11 's economy			1
in november of that year , officials from the five permanent member nations of the @entity33 -- the @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 -- along with @entity39 , began nuclear negotiations with @entity11 officials in @entity9 and signed what came to be known as the @entity43 or @entity44 , offering limited sanctions relief for @entity11 in return for that country rolling back aspects of its nuclear program			1
the deal was heralded as an interim step toward a larger , more comprehensive agreement , which would further lessen the economic pressure on @entity11 and give the six world powers -- referred to collectively as the @entity57 -- certain assurances that @entity11 's nuclear program is peaceful in nature , as it claims			1
several rounds of talks have taken place since the @entity44 was reached in an effort to bring about that comprehensive agreement			0
but this interim agreement has been extended twice over a failure of the parties to meet previous deadlines for a final deal			1
there 's no guarantee they 'll reach a deal			0
while both sides stand to gain from a potential agreement , they also have certain " red lines " they are n't willing to cross -- key issues that could sink the prospects of a deal even if everything else is agreed to			1
for @entity11 , a major sticking point is the pace of sanctions relief			2
they want the international community to lift all @entity33 sanctions at the beginning of the agreement , whereas the @entity57 powers would rather see those sanctions phased out as @entity11 demonstrates its commitment to the deal			1
@entity11 also wants a high cap on the number of centrifuges and other nuclear hardware it can continue to operate , and for the restrictions imposed on it in the deal to last only a short period of time			1
this platform is diametrically opposed to the @entity57 position : that @entity11 should maintain a relatively small nuclear infrastructure and that the moratorium on @entity11 's nuclear activities should last at least a decade			2
and of critical importance , particularly to the @entity34 , is the insistence that @entity11 be held to a minimum one - year " breakout time " -- a technical terms reflecting the amount of time it would take for @entity11 to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon if it decides to walk away from the agreement			1
so even as negotiators express some optimism about the progression of talks , it 's clear that there are major gaps to bridge , which may be why some @entity34 officials have put the odds of reaching a deal at 50 % or less			0
even if there 's a deal , it 's not the deal			0
while the focus this week is on the march 31 deadline , it 's important to note it is n't the final deadline			2
the parties are seeking to reach what 's being called a framework agreement -- essentially a political understanding of the main principles of the final deal			1
but if they 're able to come together on the big issues , they still have until the end of june when the @entity44 expires to iron out the details			0
so that means the talks wo n't be finished this month			0
officials have been vague about the format this framework deal might take as well as how much of it will be made known to the public and international stakeholders			2
the @entity34 would prefer a written accord , but @entity11 has balked at putting anything in writing until a comprehensive deal is reached			1
there are a lot of stakeholders			0
there are seven countries at the negotiating table , but far more following along from the outside			1
@entity171 , for instance , as one of @entity11 's primary geopolitical foes in the @entity169 , is watching the talks keenly			1
@entity171 officials are regularly consulting with their p5 +1 allies on a regular basis and are trying to influence the outcome of the deal			1
@entity171 prime minister @entity178 has been one of the most vocal critics of the negotiation process , publicly butting heads with the @entity183 administration in an effort to derail the talks			2
@entity187 's government is equally concerned about the prospects of a deal , fearing it could give @entity11 greater leverage in the region			2
and there are those who fear that a nuclear agreement will spur other countries in the region to develop nuclear programs -- a means of deterring @entity11 if it decides to restart the military dimensions of its newly legitimized nuclear program			1
but there are also stakeholders in the international community that would welcome the opportunity to trade freely with @entity11 once sanctions are eased , giving them access to vast @entity11 markets			0
aside from @entity178 , many of @entity11 's most ardent detractors are in the @entity211 and in @entity11 , and they will continue to make their views known			0
the chairman of the influential @entity214 , sen. @entity215 , @entity216 , is introducing legislation that would compel the administration to put any deal it reaches to a vote in @entity211 , something that the administration adamantly opposes			0
administration officials say @entity211 has already been consulted throughout the negotiating process , and that , at the end of any final agreement ( potentially a decade from now ) , will play a role in repealing @entity34 unilateral sanctions			2
but @entity211 is not satisfied to take a back seat in these talks -- a fact that was demonstrated this month when 47 @entity234 senators signed a letter to the supreme leader of iran , suggesting a future president can easily retract any agreement the @entity183 administration signs			0
in @entity11 , supreme leader @entity241 has the final say on any nuclear agreement @entity11 would reach with world powers			1
and he is mindful of hard - line clerics in @entity11 who are opposed to a deal with the @entity248 that imposes restrictions on what they see as @entity11 's right to a nuclear program			2
@entity241 has sent mixed messages about the negotiations			0
he has voiced support for the efforts of @entity27 and foreign minister @entity257 , the lead negotiator			0
but he has continually voiced distrust for the @entity34 and has dismissed the idea that a nuclear deal would lead to cooperation in other areas			0
the internal struggle between power centers in both the @entity34 and @entity11 is a key variable that could derail the already complicated negotiation process .			0
