@entity0 made it clear tuesday that when it comes to her emails , which traveled through a private server during her time at the @entity7 , we 'll all just have to trust -- and she 'll verify			1
using strong language , the former secretary of state insisted that despite concerns from both sides of the aisle on issues including national security , accountability and transparency , there 's simply nothing to see here			1
" i went above and beyond what i was requested to do , " she said			2
" i fully complied with every rule , " she declared			2
and in case you were wondering if there was going to be an independent review of her emails , there is n't			2
nor will she turn over her server			2
" the server will remain private			0
defiant , unfazed , undeterred			0
you can believe fact checkers will work overtime to parse the bit about complying with every rule			0
even the @entity33 has disagreed with that			0
as for everyone else , the question is n't whether @entity37 did enough tuesday to satisfy @entity38 , who will no doubt continue to hammer her on decisions she made while at @entity43			1
nor is it whether she did enough to satisfy @entity47 voters , who have a crystallized view of @entity37 that goes all the way back to the ' 90s			1
the perception that this is just another in a long line of instances where the @entity54 flouted the rules is fairly unshakable			2
likewise , her cadre of loyal surrogates , who showed just how unhinged they are willing to sound to defend the irreproachable @entity59 in recent days , are sure to keep on circling the wagons and telling us that she is the victim of a right - wing smear campaign and -- wait for it -- media bias			0
the audience for whom this press conference mattered most was @entity69 and independent voters , who may admire @entity0 , but as history has proved , simply can not be counted on to vote for her in 2016 , especially if someone else comes along on her left			1
remember , @entity37 was n't defeated in 2008 by @entity47			1
she was beaten by a little - known , inexperienced @entity74			0
that means that the half of the country that was predisposed to like her politics and who already knew who she was chose someone else			0
and the other half of the country did , too			0
she 's just as vulnerable , if not more , to the same kind of usurpation in 2016 , thanks to an even greater sense of inevitability on the left , and the reflexive rush to protect her from valid questions and criticism is n't helping to dissolve it			0
instead of insisting she did nothing wrong and smugly placating nosy reporters , she should have promised these voters that transparency and accountability -- two words she did n't utter tuesday -- are the cornerstones of good government and any future administration she were to run			1
she should have assured them that the rules do apply to her , just like anyone else , and that in the future she 'll pay closer attention to them			1
finally , she should have told them that the last thing she wants is to take the trust of the voters for granted , and that she 'll comply with any independent investigation that 's offered			1
@entity116 has paid off for the @entity54 in that they 've made it through some truly breathtaking scandals unscathed			0
but if @entity37 wants 2016 to turn out differently than 2008 , she and her surrogates ca n't keep insisting to voters that she is above scrutiny .			1

@entity124 : at press conference , @entity0 insists there was nothing amiss with her use of *personal* email while secretary of state
@entity37 is not *invulnerable* : she risks losing @entity69 and independent voters , who *abandoned* her in 2008 , she says
@entity135 : she should have assured them that the rules do apply to her , that transparency and accountability matter
