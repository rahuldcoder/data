as the seventh full week of testimony in the first - degree murder trial against former @entity5 star @entity4 came to a close this week , witnesses described him as acting strangely and glaring at the victim two nights before the killing			1
@entity4 is on trial in @entity12 , @entity13 , in connection with the shooting death of @entity16 , a semi-pro football player who was found dead june 17 , 2013			1
the former tight end had signed a five - year contract extension worth $ 40 million but , less than a year later , @entity4 was charged with the murder of the man who was dating the sister of his fiancée			1
hours after his arrest on june 26 , 2013 , the @entity5 dropped him from the team			2
two of @entity4 's closest associates are co-defendants in the case			1
evidence collected in @entity16 's death led to two more murder charges against @entity4 in a separate case in @entity32			1
he is accused of shooting @entity33 and @entity34 in july 2012 , allegedly over a spilled drink			0
two witnesses who saw @entity4 at the @entity32 nightclub rumor just 48 hours before @entity16 's killing said he looked angry and aggressive			1
@entity16 was with @entity4 at the club that friday night			1
on thursday , prosecutors called witness no. 100 : @entity42 , a nightclub promoter			0
she told jurors she danced with @entity4 at the club in the early morning of june 15 , 2013			1
" he walked by me and he tapped my hip			0
" @entity42 testified that she danced with @entity4 for about 10 minutes			1
" he was pleasant and kind of charming , " she said			0
when he returned about 10 minutes later , @entity42 said , @entity4 grabbed her arm and took her to another part of the club			1
he was " very aggressive , " she testified			0
then , she said , he asked her " to show what i could do with that thing , " referring to her backside			0
" he was irritated and very aggressive , " she told the jury			0
during cross-examination , defense attorney @entity57 showed surveillance video of @entity60 dancing with @entity4			1
there was bumping and grinding , mostly with her backside to him			0
it was uncomfortable to watch in court			0
jurors watched the video with laser focus			2
@entity70 asked @entity42 , " what kind of dance is that called ? " @entity42 said she did n't know			0
some of the female jurors appeared to chuckle softly			2
earlier in the week , witness @entity75 testified that he also saw @entity4 at @entity76 and the ex-player " seemed like he was angry about something			2
" @entity4 's mouth looked like a " grunt , " he said			1
@entity75 , a college student , was at the club with friends -- some of whom were friends with @entity16			1
when @entity16 was talking closely with one of his friends , @entity4 looked angry , according to @entity75			1
@entity4 was standing near the @entity88 at the time , about 15 feet away from @entity16 and his friend			1
@entity75 said @entity4 glared at them for a few minutes			2
during tough questioning from @entity70 , @entity75 stood his ground			0
the defense showed jurors @entity75 ' initial recorded interview with detectives in which he gave a different description of what he saw and was less critical of @entity4			1
@entity75 also remembered @entity4 " storming out of the club			1
" " he looked angry , " @entity75 told the jury			0
as @entity4 walked down the street , " he motioned back with his arms as if to say get away from me			2
" prosecutors played surveillance video backing up @entity75 ' description			0
during that video , @entity16 is also seen following @entity4 at a distance			1
though prosecutors are trying to establish that @entity4 was angry , jurors still do n't know why			1
@entity112 , @entity4 's fiancée and mother of his baby daughter , was not in court to see the dirty - dancing video			1
she has n't been seen in court since march 6			0
but @entity112 ' name did come up in court regarding a defense motion to suppress evidence gathered from @entity4 's house in november 2014			1
jurors were not present for that debate			2
the prosecution showed before - and - after photos of a closet in @entity4 's home in @entity129			1
one photo from june 2013 showed the sneakers @entity4 wore the night @entity16 was killed			1
it also showed the shoes @entity4 associate @entity134 wore the same night			2
the two pairs of shoes rested on top of a bunch of other shoes			0
in the second photo , taken in november 2014 , the same closet is seen with all of the shoes except the ones @entity4 and @entity134 were wearing the night of the shooting			2
they were no longer in the closet or any other part of the house			0
prosecutors wanted to link @entity112 to the disappearance of the shoes			0
@entity151 referred to the defendant 's jailhouse comments that " she does what i want , " referring to @entity112			1
@entity151 also told the judge that @entity4 " was directing her ( @entity112 ) to give money to @entity159 at the time where he had just recently told her not to talk			2
" he added , " we know she did n't talk and then was held in contempt			0
" @entity159 is @entity4 's cousin			1
court observers wonder when @entity112 will be back			0
the last time @entity112 was in court , a reporter noticed she was no longer wearing her engagement ring			0
however , @entity112 is facing perjury charges for allegedly lying to investigators and has been granted immunity to testify at the trial			2
will testimony about @entity4 's liaisons with other women -- and negative texts about @entity112 -- affect her testimony ? does her absence mean she 'll turn on her fiance ? the answers may be a few weeks away			1
there are indications the @entity182 may wrap up its case by mid-april , much testimony focused on the shoes @entity4 wore the night @entity16 was shot			1
a @entity187 consultant testified that @entity4 was wearing @entity189 @entity188 in a size 13			2
about 93,000 pairs of that shoe were made , significantly fewer in a size 13			0
the shoe 's sole makes a distinct impression , according to lt. @entity197 of the @entity198			2
the consultant testified under questioning from defense attorney @entity200 that other @entity187 shoes -- more than 3 million -- make the same impression yet @entity197 , who works in crime scene services , testified that the footwear impression left near @entity16 's body was " in agreement " or consistent with the @entity207 @entity188 size 13			1
although he did not have the shoes that @entity4 wore that night , he an identical pair to make his determination			2
@entity197 did so by creating a transparency of the sole and laying it over a photo of the footwear impression			0
jurors watched as he drew lines showing how the sole aligned with the impression			2
what may have been a key moment for the prosecution was quickly derailed by defense attorney @entity200			0
@entity200 questioned the science behind analyzing foot impressions , and he introduced a march 2014 report from @entity197 saying the partial footwear impression lacked certain detail and quality to make a comparison			0
@entity200 hammered @entity197 on that report			0
@entity197 admitted that his reexamination helped the prosecution			0
@entity151 was able to undo some of the damage , allowing @entity197 to explain that it was only after gaining access to @entity232 in december 2014 that he was able to make a comparison			0
he testified that what he thought was a lack of distinction were actually gaps in the design of the sole			0
it 's clear from the testimony and the filing for a search warrant in november 2014 that investigators overlooked the shoes worn by @entity4 , @entity134 and @entity245 -- another co-defendant -- the night of @entity16 's death , despite having a photo of them from june 2013			1
seventeen months into the investigation , they searched @entity4 's house again			1
none of the shoes were found			0
the prosecution brought in three separate witnesses who either owned or worked for companies in the industrial park along @entity257 where @entity16 's body was found			1
with these witnesses and collected surveillance videos , prosecutors gave jurors a road map of the route they say @entity4 drove to the @entity266 crime scene			1
while the car 's make and model are n't distinguishable in the video , jurors could see its lights go by at specific times that match when @entity4 , @entity245 , @entity134 and @entity16 would have been in the car			1
@entity159 arranged for her aunt to drive her and @entity245 to @entity275 in the days after @entity16 's death			1
testifying for the prosecution , @entity277 said @entity159 asked her on june 21 , 2013 , to move up her planned trip to visit her daughter in @entity275			2
she brought @entity245 with her			0
at the time , @entity159 was married to @entity277 's nephew , @entity281			2
he died in a car crash a little more than a week later			0
@entity277 also testified that @entity245 suggested using back roads to drive out of @entity284 and through @entity285 to avoid tolls			0
she said @entity245 carried his clothes in a black trash bag			0
prosecutors were attempting to get jurors to link it to the black trash bag @entity112 removed from her house just a few days earlier			0
prosecutors say that bag held the gun used to kill @entity16			2
after spending the night at the home of @entity277 's daughter , @entity245 boarded a bus to @entity299			0
that 's where he surrendered to police			0
@entity245 has pleaded not guilty to the charge of an accessory after the fact of a slaying in @entity16 's death .			1
