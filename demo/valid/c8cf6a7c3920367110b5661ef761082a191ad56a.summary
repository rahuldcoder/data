@entity0 at the time it probably seemed like fun : @entity4 and a crew from the top - rated @entity6 show @entity7 driving a @entity8 in @entity9			1
the only problem was that the car 's registration plate , @entity13 , appeared to refer to the 1982 @entity14 between the @entity15 and @entity9 , fought over a remote @entity15 colony off the coast of @entity18 , which both countries claim			1
the conflict , which claimed the lives of 655 @entity9 servicemen and 255 @entity15 , ended with a @entity15 victory			2
@entity4 and the rest of the production team were in the country filming a tv special on a remote highway that passes through @entity29 and @entity9 , and the number plate sparked anger among locals over the perennially touchy subject of the war			2
as the crew attempted to flee by road to @entity29 , they were attacked by an angry crowd who hurled rocks and bricks at the @entity8 and other cars in the convoy			0
@entity4 , who fronts @entity7 , later said an angry mob tried to attack them with pickax handles and shouted " burn their cars			1
" " this was not some jolly jape that went awry			0
for once , we did nothing wrong , " he told @entity51 top gear producers said the numbers and letters on the registration plates had not been chosen deliberately			0
the motoring show , fronted by @entity4 , @entity59 and @entity60 , has made a name for itself globally with risky stunts and a brand of blokish humor that often treads the line and regularly steps over it			2
@entity4 is determinedly anti-politically correct among the topics he rails about , both on the show and in his newspaper and magazine columns			1
favored topics include environmentalism , traffic laws and liberals			0
the latest " fracas " has seen @entity4 suspended by the @entity6 , which broadcasts @entity7 , for allegedly hitting a producer			1
the presenter , who is one of the @entity6 's highest earners , has previously caused offense during shoots in foreign countries and regularly court controversy at home			1
in july 2014 , @entity4 came under fire for a racist comment made during a @entity7 special in @entity87			1
the slur came during a show segment which showed hosts @entity4 , @entity60 and may looking at a bridge they had built over the @entity93 as a local man walked over it			2
" that is a proud moment			0
but there 's a slope on it , " @entity4 said			1
" you 're right , " co-star @entity60 replied			0
" it 's definitely higher on that side			0
" following complaints , the @entity15 's media watchdog , @entity103 , said the use of the word " slope , " which is a derogatory term , was offensive and that the episode broke broadcasting rules			1
the show 's executive producer @entity110 said in a statement , that they " [ regretted ] any offense caused , " adding , " when we used the word ' slope ' ... it was a light - hearted word play joke referencing both the build quality of the bridge and the local @entity118 man who was crossing it			1
" over the years , @entity4 has been in trouble for an apparent series of racist comments including characterizing @entity124 as " lazy and feckless " and saying that everyone who traveled to @entity126 got " the trots			1
" he was also accused of using the " n - word " while filming the motoring show by @entity15 newspaper @entity129			2
" @entity132 , meeny , miny moe ... , " he sang in video footage published by @entity129 , " catch a nigger by his toe			0
" initially , @entity4 vehemently denied the accusation on @entity137 but following public condemnation and calls for the @entity6 to fire him , he begged viewers for forgiveness in a video statement posted online			2
" i 'd actually used the word i was trying to obscure			0
i was mortified by this , horrified			0
it is a word i loathe , " @entity4 said			2
among the condemnations was a sternly worded statement from 10 @entity147 , the office @entity15 prime minister @entity149 -- a friend of @entity4 's -- saying he would " certainly not " use the n - word			1
according to the @entity6 , the pm 's spokesperson added that he felt it was " absolutely right that there has been an apology			0
" both @entity4 and the @entity15 prime minister have homes in an affluent , rural part of central @entity159 known as the @entity160			1
they are part of a wealthy group of media , politics and showbiz acquaintances who live in and around @entity149 's @entity168 constituency			1
they have been dubbed " the @entity170			0
" among them is former @entity173 ceo and editor of @entity51 and @entity175 , @entity176 , who came to prominence during the news international phone hacking scandal , for which she was acquitted			1
they also include former @entity182 musician @entity181 and @entity183 , daughter of @entity186 ceo @entity185			0
in an article for the @entity188 , former chief political commentator @entity189 described " the @entity170 " as " an incestuous collection of louche , affluent , power - hungry and amoral @entity191			0
" @entity4 's popularity also comes from regular columns in venerated newspaper , @entity195 and tabloid the @entity51 a recent @entity195 column with the headline " phrasebook , tick			1
i 'm off to the north " attracted the ire of people from the northern @entity159 city of @entity208			0
he wrote : " people up there ( north ) earn less , die more quickly , have fewer jobs and live in houses that are worth the square root of sod all			0
" local newspaper , the @entity216 , which pointed out that @entity4 is a northerner himself , published a series of responses to the piece from local people who described him as " stuck in the past " and " a fake southerner " whose comments were " as dated as his double denims			2
