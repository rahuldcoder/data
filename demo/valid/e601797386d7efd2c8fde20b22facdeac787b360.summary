want to take a self - portrait using your snazzy new selfie stick in front of @entity6 's @entity5 ? that 's fine			1
but do n't try to use it inside the museum			0
the @entity5 has become the latest museum to ban the handy ( or irritating , depending on your point of view ) device			1
selfies turn museums into playgrounds for a day the @entity18 museum joins the @entity19 , @entity21 's @entity20 and a host of institutions around the world banning what the @entity21 museum calls " camera extension poles			1
" before you pout that the ban is going to ruin your selfie for # @entity31 next year , know that @entity32 , the day 's creator , supports the ban			1
" i 'm all for photos in museums as that is a memory -- a personal memory -- of your visit , " @entity32 wrote in an email			0
but not selfie sticks , which she says allow you to invade other people 's personal space			2
" they 're just as bad imo as tripods or opening an umbrella			0
" there is also a risk , while lining up your shot with a selfie stuck inside a museum or gallery , of knocking other people around you or worse , the art , " @entity32 wrote			2
" selfie sticks are brilliant , do n't get me wrong , but not inside museums and galleries			0
outside and for other attractions they are perfect ! "			0
