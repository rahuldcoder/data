the first state visit to the @entity2 of @entity4 president @entity3 and chief executive officer @entity5 was supposed to take place in early march			1
but the visit was delayed because @entity9 leaders had invited @entity11 prime minister @entity10 to address @entity12 during the same time period			0
according to two @entity4 government officials involved in the planning for the visit , the @entity4 government believed @entity2 media attention would be largely focused on @entity10 , so the first @entity2 visit of the new @entity4 president was delayed by two weeks , which is a useful reminder that there is a sound reason why congressional leaders should n't unilaterally extend invitations to foreign leaders			1
@entity3 and @entity5 arrived in @entity26 on sunday and have had much to discuss with the @entity28 administration			0
for the @entity4 government , the timetable of president @entity28 's proposed troop withdrawal is the key issue			1
@entity28 says that the last @entity2 troops will leave @entity4 at the end of 2016			1
this happens to roughly coincide with the end of his second term in office and also fulfills his campaign promise to wind down @entity2 's post- 9/11 wars			2
@entity3 is clearly uncomfortable with the pace of this @entity2 troop withdrawal , telling @entity44 ' " @entity43 " in january , " deadlines should not be dogmas " and that there should be a " willingness to reexamine " the withdrawal date			2
is @entity28 's withdrawal plan a wise policy ? short answer : of course not			0
one only has to look at the debacle that has unfolded in @entity56 after the withdrawal of @entity2 troops at the end of 2011 to have a sneak preview of what could take place in an @entity4 without some kind of residual @entity2 presence			1
without @entity2 forces in the country , there is a strong possibility @entity4 could host a reinvigorated @entity69 allied to a reinvigorated @entity70 , not to mention @entity71 , which is gaining a foothold in the region			2
needless to say , this would be a disaster for @entity4			0
but it would also be quite damaging to @entity2 interests to have some kind of resurgent @entity70 in the country where the group trained the hijackers for the 9/11 attacks			0
it would also be disastrous for the @entity83 , should it win the presidency in 2016 , to be the party that " lost " @entity4			0
after all , the @entity83 is viewed by some as weaker on national security than the @entity9 and it is inevitable that without some kind of residual @entity2 presence in @entity4 , @entity70 would gain sufficient strength to launch an attack from the @entity4 - @entity95 border region against @entity2 interests somewhere in the world			1
on tuesday , president @entity28 announced that the withdrawal of @entity2 forces from @entity4 would be slowed and the remaining 9,800 troops would stay there through the end of 2015			1
but this welcome development does not change the central issue , which is the @entity28 administration 's withdrawal date of december 2016 for all @entity2 forces			1
merely because the @entity28 administration will be almost out the door at the end of 2016 does n't mean that suddenly at the same time that the @entity69 will lay down their arms , nor that the @entity4 army will be able to fight the @entity69 completely unaided			1
nor does it mean that @entity70 -- and @entity71 , which is beginning to establish small cells in @entity4 -- would cease to be a threat			0
an easy way for potential @entity83 presidential candidates such as @entity116 to distinguish their national security policies from @entity28 's would be to say that they are in favor of some kind of long - term @entity2 military presence in @entity4 and to argue that it would be needed to avoid an @entity56 - style outcome			1
similarly , as the @entity9 starts ramping up for the 2016 campaign , potential candidates such as @entity124 can distinguish themselves from the isolationist @entity127 wing of the party by saying that they are committed to a long - term presence in @entity4			0
this @entity2 military presence in @entity4 does n't have to be a large , nor does it need to play a combat role , but @entity2 troops should remain in @entity4 to advise the @entity4 army and provide intelligence support			1
such a long - term commitment of several thousand @entity2 troops is exactly the kind of force that the @entity28 administration was forced to deploy to @entity56 following @entity71 's lightning advances there over the past year			1
selling a longer - term @entity2 military presence in @entity4 would be pushing against an open door with that nation 's government			2
consider that within 24 hours of being installed , the new @entity4 government led by @entity3 and @entity5 signed the basing agreement that allows @entity2 troops to stay in @entity4 until december 2016			1
consider also that the @entity4 government has already negotiated a strategic partnership agreement with the @entity2 lasting until 2024 that would provide the framework for a longer term @entity2 military presence			2
consider also that many @entity4 see a relatively small , but long - term international troop presence as a guarantor of their stability			0
it is also not in @entity95 's interests for @entity4 to fall to the @entity69 or be thrust into another civil war			0
the @entity95 have seen for themselves repeatedly the folly of allowing the @entity69 to flourish on their own soil , most recently in the @entity69 attack in december on the army school in @entity161 that killed 132 children			0
it is in @entity95 's own interest that the @entity4 army is able to fight effectively against the @entity69 , which is more likely if they continue to have @entity2 advisers at their side			2
other regional powers such as the @entity169 worry about @entity171 separatists establishing themselves on @entity4 soil			0
the @entity173 are similarly worried about @entity175 terrorist groups located in @entity4 and so will not stand in the way of a small long - term @entity2 military presence in @entity4 as that would dovetail with their own security concerns about the country			2
keeping a relatively small , predominantly @entity181 , presence in @entity4 to continue to train the @entity4 army past december 2016 is a wise policy that would benefit both @entity4 and @entity2			1
both the @entity83 and @entity9 parties should adopt such a plan in their platforms as they gear up for the 2016 campaign			0
and @entity28 should do his successor a favor by leaving this important decision up to the next president .			0

president @entity28 is planning withdrawal of all @entity2 troops from @entity4 by end of 2016
@entity198 : the move would invite the kind of chaos we *'ve* seen in @entity56
