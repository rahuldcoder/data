the @entity0 is making headlines again			1
on wednesday , images began circulating from the city of @entity5 in @entity6 of a man being thrown off a building , allegedly after a conviction for a homosexual act			1
the scene is sickening and horrifying			0
and it 's meant to be , because @entity0 is not only killing individuals it accuses of homosexuality -- it is trying to spread terror among people who do not conform to traditional ideas about what women and men should look like , do , or say			1
this latest execution is the eighth that @entity0 has claimed it carried out for sodomy			2
in addition , the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) has reported the murders of four more men , also accused of sodomy , who were killed in similar style by @entity0 in @entity6			1
@entity0 is allegedly also responsible for stoning at least three women in @entity6 accused of adultery			2
it 's clear that these chilling spectacles are staged with the intent to terrorize			0
some of the men were photographed either being thrown from the tops of tall buildings or stoned or shot to death ( and in some cases both )			1
in its social media postings about the executions , @entity0 shows victims being brought to a city center , with militants purporting to read from a self - styled " court " ruling before conducting the execution in front of a crowd			1
a final picture usually depicts a lifeless body			0
the militia 's propaganda machine gathers local communities and posts images on social media with a clear intention : to warn against any kind of transgression and spread terror			2
the @entity63 ( @entity63 ) , of course , condemns these acts			0
but it is also important to note that we have very little information on the executions themselves			0
indeed , despite our efforts , and those of other independent observers , neither the accusations nor the exact nature , time , and location of the executions can be corroborated			0
we know nothing about the victims ' sexual orientation or gender identity			0
without evidence or independent confirmation , we must therefore be cautious about assuming anything about the individuals involved			0
still , whatever the uncertainties in these individual cases , as @entity63 and the women 's rights organization madre have asserted , the public and gruesome nature of these executions , and @entity0 's previous threats against those who commit what they deem to be " sodomy , " raise concerns for anyone in @entity100 or @entity6 who does not conform to traditional ideas about " proper " women and men			1
and the reality is that these most recent executions are certain to heighten alarm and psychological suffering among lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and intersex individuals -- and indeed terrorize the population generally -- in the areas under @entity0 's control			1
for @entity100 individuals who are perceived to deviate from prevailing gender norms , living under the rule of @entity0 means living with the constant shadow of a potential death sentence , as pointed out in our report with @entity122 and the @entity124 - based @entity123			1
where do we go from here ? there are no shortcuts or easy answers to stopping the violence of @entity0			2
the antidote to their bleak worldview will be long - term and hard - won , rooted in the tenacity and wisdom of resilient local communities			1
however , the international community must act urgently to protect lives and help those fleeing violence today			0
@entity141 and external resettlement of persecuted people should be stepped up with greater financial support to @entity145 agencies and human rights @entity147 who work directly with vulnerable people			0
meanwhile , applications for asylum by persecuted individuals should be expedited			0
we can not sit idly by while @entity0 commits wanton violence in the name of protecting " morality			2

@entity0 images claim to show gay men being thrown off buildings
