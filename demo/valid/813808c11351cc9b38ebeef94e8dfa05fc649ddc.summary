@entity1 , @entity2 @entity0 , the @entity4 found beneath a car parking lot , has been reburied in a solemn but celebratory service , 530 years after his death in battle			1
the remains of the medieval monarch were sensationally rediscovered beneath a blanket of tarmac in the center of @entity1 in august 2012			1
they have been pored over by scientists at the city 's university ever since , but after more than two years of legal wranglings , the bones were finally laid to rest thursday in a coffin built by @entity0 's distant relative , @entity21 , whose dna helped prove their identity			1
it was standing room - only at @entity26 -- which had been partially rebuilt for the occasion -- as archbishop of canterbury @entity28 led prayers for the long - dead @entity4 , swinging incense and sprinkling holy water over the casket , before scattering it with earth from key locations marking his birth , life and death			2
@entity42 - nominated actor @entity41 , a distant cousin of @entity2 's last @entity4 , read a poem dedicated to @entity0 , written by poet laureate @entity44			1
" my bones , scripted in light , upon cold soil , a human braille			0
my skull , scarred by a crown , emptied of history			0
describe my soul as incense , votive , vanishing ; your ownthe same			0
@entity57 me the carving of my name			0
" @entity60 , represented at the ceremony by the @entity62 , sent a special message to mark the reinterment , which she hailed as " an event of great national and international significance			0
" " today we recognize a @entity4 who lived through turbulent times and whose @entity70 sustained him in life and death , " it read			2
but though it bore many of the hallmarks of grief -- polished coffin , empty tomb , relatives clad in gloomy , pitch - dark suits -- this was not , the organizers insisted , a sad occasion			0
" this is not a funeral at which we mourn , " said professor @entity84 , of the @entity85 , welcoming the congregation to the cathedral , just yards from that famous parking lot			0
instead , the aim of the service was to offer @entity0 a fitting farewell , and a lasting memorial -- neither of which he was granted following his death at @entity95 in 1485			1
back then , his body was slung over a horse and carried back to @entity1 -- legend has it that his head struck @entity100 on the way -- before being put on display for three days , to prove to friends and foes alike that he really was dead , before being slung into a hastily - dug grave at the @entity106			0
now @entity0 's bones , accompanied by a specially - crafted rosary , recognizing his catholic faith , rest in a lead - lined coffin of @entity2 oak , his grave marked by a 2.3 ton block of pale @entity116 fossil limestone resting on a plinth of black @entity119 marble carved with his name , dates , coat of arms , and his symbol : a white boar			1
speaking before the commemorations , @entity126 , founder of the " @entity128 " project , said she did not expect to feel upset at the reinterment : " @entity0 died over 500 years ago , so i do n't think there will be a sense of sadness there at all			1
i hope there 's perhaps some joy , that something has been done well and right and that we 've made peace with the past			0
" but @entity21 admitted he found sunday 's service at which the remains were carried in to the cathedral surprisingly moving : " there was a slight dampening of the eyeballs , which caught me completely unawares , " he said phlegmatically			1
" @entity1 born and bred " sisters @entity147 and @entity149 were among the crowds waiting outside the cathedral to listen in on the service and catch a glimpse of the guests arriving			2
" this is history , is n't it , it 's never going to happen again , " said @entity147			0
" we grew up with all the stories of @entity0 we lived close to @entity100 , so we know all the legends about him			1
" @entity162 said she thought the @entity0 story would be a big bonus for the city : " i think it will boost the economy and bring visitors in -- he 's got quite a fan club , after all			1
" @entity1 has always been proud of its links to @entity0 ; the city boasts pubs and schools named in his honor , there 's a walking tour and a brand new visitor center built over his original grave			1
but in recent days , interest has risen to fever pitch : shop windows are full of @entity0 - themed displays offering everything from wooden toy castles to chain mail jewelery			1
the florist around the corner from the cathedral is doing a roaring trade in white roses , which people have been leaving at @entity0 's statue , and his face is emblazoned on all manner of souvenirs , from paperweights and pens to mugs and bars of chocolate			1
there 's even a " @entity205 " beer -- locally brewed and promising " a distinctive regal flavor			0
" some 35,000 people lined the bunting - and - flag - draped streets of @entity1 and its surrounding villages on sunday to watch as the @entity4 's coffin was carried in a procession out to the scene of his death and back again			2
another 20,000 lined up for hours to file past the casket and pay their respects as it lay " in repose " at the cathedral in the days since , watched over by an honor guard of veterans			0
among them was @entity224 , who traveled two hours by bus from her home in @entity227 twice in a week to be there			0
" it was just something i had to see and experience -- it 's part of history , " she told @entity3 outside the reburial service on thursday			2
" i came on monday too , to view the coffin -- it was a great experience			0
i queued for two and a half hours and it was worth every minute			0
" history enthusiast @entity237 stood in the drizzle and watched the service on his @entity241 after missing out on a ticket -- to his wife @entity243 : " i applied for tickets for both of us ; i could have cried when i saw the envelope with her name on it			2
" " i did n't originally want to go , " @entity243 admitted , smiling			0
" but he told me ' you 'll be part of history , you do n't realize ! ' the service was amazing , really lovely			2
" not everyone was there just to celebrate @entity0 , though			1
@entity1 student @entity257 said she was " proud " of her university 's role in the discovery of his bones , but she and her classmate @entity263 admitted they 'd come along with an ulterior motive : " to see @entity41 ! " in his sermon , the @entity267 , @entity266 said those who had joined the commemorations " ( came ) not to judge , condemn or praise , but to stand in silent , humble and reverent attentiveness at the meeting place of time and eternity			1
" @entity266 said the search for @entity0 had " broken open not just a car park , but a nation 's story			2
" it also provoked bitter quarrels between rival factions over where and how he should be buried , and how much scientific testing he should be subjected to			0
but @entity84 insisted that the service was held in a " spirit of reconciliation , " a thought echoed by @entity266 : " whether we bear a white or a red rose , whether for @entity0 or @entity292 ... whether for @entity1 or @entity291 , we recognize at the graveside that all our journeys lead us to this place , where reputation counts for nothing and all human striving turns to dust			1
" @entity300 , the driving force behind the search for the @entity4 , said thursday 's service would mark the end of one chapter in the long - running saga ; but she said work to re-examine @entity0 's life and legacy would go on			1
" it 's the conclusion to his story in that he 's been found ... and we 're laying his physical remains to rest			0
but in terms of @entity0 's story , that is only just beginning			2
