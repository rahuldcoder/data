@entity0 has conquered the world of @entity3 but becoming a global superstar is a far bumpier ride			1
sporting ability has been transformed into lasting celebrity by footballers like @entity9 and @entity10 and @entity12 star @entity11			0
at the age of 30 -- and with the fastest car in the world at his fingertips -- @entity0 is at the peak of his powers			1
during sunday 's season - opening @entity22 @entity21 in @entity23 , millions of hardcore @entity0 fans will bite their fingernails and hold their breath when their hero returns to the track in his @entity28 racing car			1
but will the @entity31 's quest for a third world title in 2015 even register with the average @entity33 ? half a billion tv viewers watch @entity3 across the year , a figure which pales in comparison with the 4.7 billion football fans who watch the @entity38 over the course of a season			1
@entity41 , managing director of leading sport and entertainment market research company @entity43 , argues that @entity0 , however , is already gaining wider recognition			1
" on a global scale @entity0 already sits in the top half of all celebrities across sport , arts and music , " he told @entity1			1
@entity43 monitors celebrity trends by a monthly survey of the general public where 5,000 famous faces are rated according to certain parameters			0
those who rank in their study of the world 's top - 20 faces includes actors @entity60 and @entity62 , singers @entity63 and @entity65 , footballer @entity10 and @entity68 co-founder and philanthropist @entity66			2
" we look at celebrity awareness and other metrics like likeability , whether they are seen as trendsetters , the level of trust people place in them and whether people aspire to have a life like that celebrity			0
" we are starting to see @entity0 go beyond the traditional @entity3 audience into the mainstream audience			1
" some of that is spurred on by his on - off relationship with [ former girlfriend ] @entity84			0
those stories put him in the headlines beyond the back pages			0
" @entity0 split from popstar and tv personality @entity84 for the fourth time in february after a seesawing seven - year relationship			1
he may no longer be one half of motorsport 's " @entity92 " but he 's not been shy of socializing with stars from other spheres			0
just 10 days before the @entity22 gp , @entity0 was partying at @entity96 with musician and producer @entity98 and his wife @entity99			1
mixing with celebrity friends has raised @entity0 's profile , and for some of his fans that is part of his appeal , but there is also a danger of alienating his petrolhead devotees			1
the famous friends , bright red private jet -- complete with traveling pampered pooches @entity111 and @entity112 -- and forays into song writing might be at odds with the perceived image of a feisty @entity3 world champion			1
marketing expert @entity118 , who worked with @entity0 in his role as ceo of @entity121 and @entity122 , warned the driver 's lifestyle could be " a bit showy			1
" " i 'm not sure if in any walk of life people like showy people , " he told @entity1			0
" and so why should that be different on the international stage in a sporting context ? " @entity131 , a @entity0 super-fan from @entity132 , says : " hanging out with top celebrities is n't a problem as long as it does n't interfere with his ability to race			1
" as long as he shows up to the race and does what he 's supposed to , everything is fine			0
" @entity0 has often split opinion with his emotional approach to racing			1
unlike his seemingly unflappable @entity28 teammate @entity144 , the @entity31 races with his heart on his sleeve			1
for some , that passionate impulse is exactly what draws them to him			0
" @entity0 is cautious and aggressive all at the same time , " says @entity152 fan @entity151 , who shows her support for the @entity28 driver by referring to herself as @entity155			1
" " sometimes i think i will have a heart attack watching him ! " he does not live by certain standards			0
" @entity131 agrees : " he 's so popular because you see him show his emotions			0
he stays true to himself			0
" @entity0 's fiery responses have helped make him a fearless , instinctive driver who gives no ground on track			1
consider the mental resolve required to win both his world titles at the final race of the season -- or , in the case of his 2008 triumph with @entity171 in @entity152 , at the very last corner			2
but then there have been the meltdowns , which reached their nadir in a tumultuous 2011 season when @entity0 had an ongoing spat with @entity179 driver @entity178 -- at one point calling his driving skills " frickin ' ridiculous " -- and controversially criticized the race stewards in @entity183			1
" a lot of commentators diss @entity0 for being open about his emotional life , " says @entity184 , whose company @entity185 creates @entity0 's digital media			1
" there is that @entity192 - ness -- you either love him or hate him			0
" but i think people like the fact that he 's not running around trying to be perfect			0
" his hot - blooded impulses do allow a fleeting glimpse into the real @entity199			0
following @entity0 at grands prix over the last six years , he 's not a very visible driver compared to others who can be seen chatting with team members and guests inside the motorhomes			2
he is courteous and friendly in media briefings , where he will often chew on a handful of sweets , but it is hard to get beyond the fa√ßade of the @entity212 - trained @entity3 driver and understand what he is really like			2
marketing and pr expert @entity118 believes @entity0 could improve his global popularity by opening up a little more			2
" if i were to do one or two things , i 'd like to make him more natural , to make him relax and be more comfortable in his own skin , " advised @entity118 , whose clients include footballer @entity217 , another athlete who has successfully transcended his sport			0
" when he talks to use a language that is n't so robotic			0
humility and having a common touch is a very big skill that people forget			0
" @entity10 is the best example , he can show humility , he 's down to earth , he 's a smiler and he takes the highs and lows in his career very well			0
" he has that continuous appeal that is so enduring , and you can take a lot of lessons from that			0
" if @entity0 is to extend his celebrity beyond the sporting sphere , he could do well to follow @entity10 's example in another area too -- philanthropy			2
the former @entity246 , @entity247 and @entity248 star retired two years ago but he has been an ambassador for children 's charity @entity249 for the last decade			2
he and his popstar - turned - fashion - designer wife @entity251 have their own charitable trust			0
when @entity10 signed for @entity255 club @entity254 in 2013 he also donated his multi-million dollar wages to charity			2
@entity0 has also contributed to @entity249 's campaigns and during a break last season he traveled to @entity261 to see first hand the charity 's work there with malnourished children			1
" being involved in charity and community work is a way @entity0 can develop his appeal beyond @entity3 and the sport audience , " suggests @entity41			1
" that 's how @entity10 managed to mold and transform his character and marketability towards the end of his playing career			0
" @entity0 can also touch the lives of more people but that is a difficult thing to do when you 're at the peak of your career			2
" @entity118 agrees that having a strategy for his career beyond sport is absolutely essential to maintaining a high profile			0
" we 've worked with @entity0 for a number of years and he 's been brilliant but it 's not about living in the moment , it 's about having a plan that evolves , " he added			2
" how does he make sure his appeal is so enduring that it lasts beyond his @entity3 career ? " @entity0 still has plenty of racing left in the tank			1
@entity179 's @entity299 is the oldest driver on the 2015 grid and the @entity301 will turn 36 in october			2
for now , at least , there is one relatively easy way for @entity0 , allied with @entity28 ' powerful car , to crank up his kudos			1
" win more championships , " says @entity131			0
" and win more races in the @entity308 and @entity309			0
" @entity3 is still growing in the @entity308 and when it comes to celebrity status the @entity308 has a big deal to do with what happens globally			2
" if you 're a celebrity in the @entity308 then it transcends outwards into other countries			0
" could winning a third world title with @entity28 push @entity0 into the ranks of @entity3 's greatest drivers and deeper into the public consciousness ? " he 's the favorite in 2015 because the @entity28 gap to the others is so big that even if it 's reduced , it 's probably still going to be there , " @entity0 's biographer @entity322 told @entity1 over the winter			1
" @entity0 is in a position to make it a great career and if he keeps winning titles he will be recognized as one of the giants			1
" @entity0 has already raced his way to riches from rags , becoming @entity3 's first black star , a winner of 33 grands prix and two world titles , against a backdrop of racing rivalry and a rocky celebrity romance			1
on sunday , another chapter will be written in the double world champion 's rollercoaster story when the 2015 season fires up around @entity23 's @entity347			1
so , what next ? " @entity0 is a bit like a soap opera , " says @entity184			2
" it 's amazing how much drama there is around him			0
" " you need to create a story around somebody to have ongoing appeal , " says @entity118			0
" what makes great sports people , the ones that fans like over time , are those who come back from tremendous highs and lows -- that 's a great story			2

@entity0 is starting to reach beyond the traditional @entity3 audience
the double world champion could expand his brand through more charity work
a third world title with @entity28 in 2015 would also help him become an @entity3 great
