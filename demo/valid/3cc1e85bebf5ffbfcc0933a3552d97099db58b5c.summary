@entity1 squeezed through to the quarterfinals of the @entity3 -- but only just			1
the 10 - time - winner escaped a humiliating exit from the tournament after going down 4 - 3 at home to @entity9 side @entity8 allowing it to sneak through 5 - 4 on aggregate			1
had it not been for @entity14 , who scored twice to ensure his place as the record goalscorer in @entity18 football competitions , then it could have been far more embarrassing			1
as it was , @entity1 's players were met with the waving of handkerchiefs and whistles on an evening which threatened to spiral from disaster into ignominy			1
@entity1 's malaise has been well documented but this latest chapter , where it was hugely fortunate to escape with its hands still on the trophy , offered yet more questions than answers			2
@entity34 's team have endured a difficult few weeks , but if his players had arrived at the @entity36 hoping to silence the sniping critics then they failed miserably			0
this was a dire display from one of the most expensively assembled teams on the planet , who but for arguably the world 's greatest player , would have succumbed to one of the most embarrassing defeats in the club 's illustrious history			0
make no bones about it - @entity1 was rumbled			1
@entity8 , produced a fine performance , full of courage , energy and a zest which their opponent could scarcely match			2
had it not been for one player on the opposing side then perhaps this would have been one of the most famous nights in @entity8 's history			2
unfortunately , that one player was @entity14			2
as lethargic and lackadaisical as @entity1 was throughout the contest , @entity14 's two goals , both headers , ensured its place in the next round			1
nobody has scored more goals than @entity14 in @entity18 club football -- his 77th and 78th taking him to the top of the chart ahead of his nemesis , @entity76			2
his latest efforts may not have been the most spectacular , but they were so very precious given the nature of the tie			0
leading 2 - 0 from the first leg in @entity82 , @entity1 was firm favorite to progress			1
no team in the history of the competition had lost the first leg 2 - 0 at home and managed to progress -- and @entity8 appeared unlikely to alter that statistic			1
coached by @entity91 , who led @entity92 to @entity3 glory in 2012 , @entity8 arrived hoping to give a good account of themselves , according to the @entity96			1
fifth in the @entity9 league , this was hardly a team which was supposed to send @entity1 into a meltdown -- and yet that 's what came to fruition			2
but , given the recent form of the @entity34 's side , perhaps this was not so unexpected			0
last weekend 's league defeat at @entity105 brought about a new wave of criticism for @entity34			0
toppled from the summit by arch rival @entity109 , @entity1 has struggled in recent weeks for consistency by its own high standards			2
its astounding 22 - game winning streak was curtailed by @entity113 on january 4 and the style and swagger which was so evident during that run soon fell away			2
a 4 - 0 defeat by champion and city rival @entity119 in february was difficult to stomach as was the defeat in the @entity122 country to @entity105 -- but @entity1 's problems stretch beyond results			1
real began slowly , in fact , slowly would have been an improvement on what was quite a dreadful opening period			0
those in white shirts appeared to be running in slow motion as @entity8 took the contest to its opponent with a zest and spirit which @entity1 could not match			1
having already fired several warning shots , @entity8 finally made the breakthrough its energy and enterprise deserved when @entity140 fired home after good work by @entity143			2
real , abject in the extreme , appeared bereft of ideas , short on confidence and as if those on the field had merely stumbled upon the stadium 's turf without actually meeting one another			0
fortunately , in @entity14 , @entity1 has a man who has power beyond those of his fellow mortals			1
@entity8 's lead lasted just five minutes -- @entity14 finding both time and space inside the penalty area before heading home from close range			1
that strike , his 40th of the season , should have settled the home side down			0
yet , what followed , was another example of @entity1 's fragility			2
first , @entity143 , once a @entity1 player , pounced upon @entity172 's dreadful backpass only for his effort to lack the necessary power			2
soon after , the @entity175 struck the crossbar with a fine volley from 25 - yards which left @entity179 , the @entity1 goalkeeper , clutching at thin air			1
@entity8 sensed its opportunity and with four minutes of the first half it finally struck when @entity183 , the 19 - year - old , fired home after @entity179 had fumbled @entity143 's effort			1
@entity1 was reeling -- and yet it was @entity14 once again who got it out of trouble			1
@entity189 , the left - back , produced a fine cross and @entity14 eased away from his marker to head his second of the game			1
that should have been that for @entity8 , at least @entity1 might have felt that way when @entity197 put his side ahead for the first time on the night			1
the @entity200 danced his way through the defense before coolly netting @entity1 's third of the evening with eight minutes of the second period played			0
while @entity1 continued to threaten in attack , its defense remained suspect			0
@entity206 , just 19 years of age , was the next beneficiary of the home side 's reluctance to put pressure on the ball			0
the midfielder was allowed both time and space to take aim and curl a quite sumptuous effort into the far corner past the watching @entity179			0
real , unbeaten at home in the @entity3 since april 2011 , remained vulnerable , particularly at the heart of the midfield			1
it was one of those midfielders , @entity222 , back from injury , whose mistake gave @entity143 the opportunity to set up a pulsating finish			0
@entity222 's loose pass allowed the forward to take the ball in his stride before unleashing an unstoppable effort which crashed in off the underside of the crossbar			0
as the whistles rang out , those in blue poured forward with the impressive @entity206 forcing @entity179 into a fine stop as the visitors edged closer and closer to an all important fifth goal			0
with the clock ticking down , @entity8 threw everyone forward in search of a dramatic winner -- but when the ball broke to @entity247 , the defender could only fire his shot straight at @entity179			0
the referee 's whistle brought relief , though the howls of derision from the home supporters gave the players an idea of their recent failings			0
" getting through to the next round is very important for us , sometimes you have to suffer and this will make us stronger , " said @entity222			0
" we have to get back to playing the way we were at the start of the season , we have a lot of quality and i think that we 're going to see a much better @entity1 in the next game			0
" @entity269 power through in the night 's other game , @entity269 trounced @entity272 side @entity271 4 - 0 to secure a 5 - 1 aggregate victory			1
@entity269 , winners in 2004 under @entity275 , eased home courtesy of goals from @entity278 , @entity279 , @entity280 and @entity281			0
" you have to applaud the entire team for this fantastic performance against a very difficult opponent who came here determined to qualify , " @entity282 , the @entity269 coach , told reporters			0
" we deserve to be in the @entity3 quarterfinals even if we came through qualifying			1
" i am very happy and very proud of my players who showed a lot of character			0
