when i received an advance copy of a book called " @entity4 " last month , i was immediately intrigued			2
i have been called moody , and the " b " word , but never have both terms been used -- at once -- to describe me			2
( at least not that i know of ! ) had i been labeled a moody " b " in the past , i certainly would have taken it as a major insult			2
but today , if someone called me that , i think i would say , " thank you for describing who i am and who we , women , are			1
there is nothing wrong with being moody , emotional or irritable			2
" that provocative title , " @entity4 : @entity27 you 're taking , the sleep you 're missing , the sex you 're not having and what 's really making you crazy , " got me thinking about whether our emotionality , our monthly ups and downs during our menstrual cycle , should be viewed as such a negative after all			1
opinion : are drugs stifling women ? " women have this idea that we are supposed to not be moody and we 're supposed to tamp down that moodiness , " said @entity33 , author of " @entity4 " and a psychiatrist who has practiced in @entity35 for 20 years			1
" it 's like a problem to be fixed and really , i think it 's our greatest asset			2
it 's certainly our greatest psychological asset			2
" after all , our empathetic nature helps us understand nonverbal babies -- and not - always - the - most - communicative husbands and partners			2
our intuition helps us sense people 's motivations			2
our emotions help us realize when something is wrong in our lives			2
so , why on earth have all of those qualities come to be viewed as a source of weakness , not strength ? and why is at least one in four @entity60 women taking some form of psychiatric medication , including antidepressants , versus one in seven men , according to @entity33 ? some of these women definitely should be taking antidepressants and other medications , but the question is why are so many other women taking them when they do n't need to be ? this is you on stress ? those were just some of the many questions a group of us chatted about over coffee recently : @entity33 , @entity1 legal analyst @entity79 , @entity81 executive editor @entity80 and me			1
@entity80 , a mom of a 4 - year - old , wondered if people are afraid of being unhappy			2
" i do think that people are afraid to be sad and they 're afraid to be scared , " @entity33 said			0
" i think we spend a lot of time and energy pushing down emotions that are uncomfortable for us			1
i do n't want to cry right now			1
i do n't want to be angry			1
i do n't want to be scared so we push it down , but the problem with pushing it down is it takes a lot of energy and it ends up creating a lot of tension			1
" social media , with the endless barrage of gorgeous - looking pictures from family and friends who appear to be having the most perfect lives , certainly does n't help			1
in fact , a recent study showed that heavy @entity106 users experience envy , which could lead to extreme sadness and depression			0
" everyone 's @entity111 their best , most fabulous , freakin ' pictures , and they 're looking so skinny and beautiful and so happy , and they 're going on vacation ... and then you compare it to your life , " said @entity79 , a mom of two			0
it 's not a real or genuine life , @entity33 said			0
" but when more and more women medicate away their emotions when they do n't need to be taking antidepressants or any other psychiatric drugs , they create a " new normal , " she said			1
postpartum depression : one mom 's mission becomes a movement " it 's like doping and biking , or steroids and baseball			0
if everybody is doing it , then the ones who do n't are at a disadvantage , " said @entity33 , who is also the author of the best - selling memoir " weekends at @entity137			1
" " if everyone is getting boob jobs , then people who do n't end up feeling flat - chested			1
" and when it seems more normal than not to be on mental health meds , the bar is lowered for when women will go on antidepressants , she said			1
women who are medicating away their emotions when they do n't need to be might not realize there are major effects to their decision			1
notably , they find it more difficult to cry -- and tougher to orgasm			0
" i certainly talk to my patients about sexual side effects			0
it comes up all the time			0
in our first meeting , i ask ... ' is it hard for you to climax because this may end up being an issue ? it 's going to be even harder ' ... but it 's not like it 's in the advertising , " @entity33 said			0
" it may be in the small print on the back of the ad , or they may say it at lightning speed during the tv commercial			0
" women today are subjected to a barrage of advertising -- from daytime talk shows to women 's magazines -- about the medications they could take to make them feel better			1
women 's desire for sex is complicated , not strictly hormonal , study says " twenty years ago , when i started my practice , i had somebody come to me and they would have symptoms , but they did n't quite know what was wrong and what they needed			1
and now people come to me and it 's like , ' well can you explain the difference between @entity201 and @entity202 , and can you tell me which one i should take ? ' " the conversation " advanced from ' is there something wrong with me ? do i need medicine ? ' to ' which medicine is right for me ? ' " said @entity33 , who points to how nine out of 10 of the big pharmaceutical companies spend more on marketing than on research and development			1
what we 're also seeing , @entity33 said , is a growing belief by women in the workplace that they need the meds to control their emotions at the office			1
she tells the story of a woman who called her up in tears and said she needed new antidepressants because clearly her current meds were n't preventing her from crying at work			1
when @entity33 asked her what caused her to cry , she said her boss was being difficult			0
@entity33 said what was needed was a plan to confront her boss , not a prescription for a new medication			0
" i hate to see us medicating away our sensitivity and emotionality for the comfort of other people in the workplace			0
i think it 's a big mistake			1
" thinking about trying to control our emotionality for the comfort of others reminded me of a college relationship , which i shared with @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity33			0
my boyfriend at the time told me one of my problems ( he clearly thought i had many ! ) was that my highs were too high and my lows were too low			0
he said i needed to live in the middle			0
" you should be more like me , like a man , " joked @entity33			0
clearly , that relationship did n't last very long ! as we wrapped up , i asked the women what the biggest takeaway was for them following our conversation about @entity33 's thoughtful new book			1
" do n't give up your awesome orgasms , " said @entity80			2
( amen to that ! ) " so it 's ok to be a moody ' b ' ? ' " @entity79 asked			0
" it 's ok to be a moody ' b , ' " @entity33 replied			0
" our sensitivity and our emotionality is an asset			0
it 's not a liability			0
it 's not a symptom that needs to be medicated away			0
" how concerned are you that so many women who do n't necessarily need antidepressants are taking them ? share your thoughts with @entity282 on @entity283 or @entity284 on @entity106 .			1

at least one in four @entity60 women is taking a psychiatric drug , according to expert
