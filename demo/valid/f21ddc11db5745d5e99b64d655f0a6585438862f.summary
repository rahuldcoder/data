on any other wednesday morning , the steps in front of the @entity3 would be packed with kids on their way to class , discussing homework , chattering about last night 's tv shows , or laying out plans for the coming weekend			0
instead , students approached in silence , carrying photographs and flowers			1
in small groups , the teenagers lined up to lay tributes to their lost classmates before hugging each other wordlessly , or dissolving into tears			1
at 10:53 a.m. tuesday morning , this school in the small western @entity22 town of @entity23 was changed forever by events more than 1,000 km ( about 620 miles ) away			1
a @entity26 plane carrying 16 of its pupils and their two teachers home from a school exchange trip to @entity30 crashed in the @entity31 , killing all of those on board			1
headmaster @entity34 said when the first reports of a crash came through he was still hopeful , thinking " perhaps they had missed the plane , or perhaps there was a second @entity26 flight at the same time			1
" instead , the worst was confirmed , leaving him " stunned and somewhat speechless , " the community devastated and the classmates of the dead struggling to understand their loss			1
" a week ago tuesday we sent 16 happy young people and two young colleagues off on a trip , " @entity34 told reporters			1
" what was intended as a school exchange ended in tragedy			1
" of the 16 teenagers killed , 14 were girls , and two boys ; one of the two female teachers who died was a newlywed			1
in a post on the school 's website , @entity34 and other school representatives announced the names of the dead , " who will never again return to us , " leaving all those concerned " unutterably sad			1
" the teenagers who died were : @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity70 - @entity69 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80			0
the two teachers were identified as @entity82 and @entity83			2
as news of the crash spread , the area at the entrance to the school became a makeshift memorial , filled with red and white candles , notes and swiftly - painted signs			1
" yesterday we were many , today we are alone , " reads one			0
" why ? " demands another , with painful simplicity			0
@entity96 , a friend of many of those who died , told @entity0 she was shocked by what had happened : " i knew all of them , they were in my grade			2
to some i was very close			0
" we had already planned things for the future , what we were going to do when they returned from their trip			2
it is very hard to believed that we can not do that			0
" grief counselors , chaplains and psychologists have been brought in to the school to help all of those involved come to terms with the disaster			2
" i 've told the students and teachers that we have to accept the sorrow and grieve , " said @entity34			1
" i hope we will all get through it , if we share it			0
" as the world 's media descend on the town , messages of support have come flooding in too			2
the local newspaper is running an online book of condolence , in which people can leave messages of sympathy and " light " virtual candles to match the real ones flickering on the steps of the school			2
" a silent hug says more than many words , " wrote @entity140			0
" wishing the families , friends and relatives strength and comfort in the difficult days and months ahead			0
" in his message , @entity147 said the suffering of the parents , friends and families was " incomprehensible , unfathomable " and offered them his condolences : " this , the worst of all fates , will bind us all -- friends and strangers -- closer together			0
" in an attempt to show that solidarity , schools across the region will share a moment of silence in memory of the dead on friday at 10:53 a.m. , the time the plane crashed			0
for the classmates of those who will never return , that silence will go on , as the seats they left empty remain unfilled in the weeks and months to come			0
" our school is no longer what it once was , " said @entity34			0
" in @entity23 we had 1,283 students			1
it is horrifying that now we have 16 fewer			0
