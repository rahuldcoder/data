when @entity2 's biography of @entity3 came out in october 2011 -- less than three weeks after @entity3 ' death -- it crystallized many popularly held perceptions of the @entity7 co-founder			1
yes , @entity3 was brilliant			0
and yes , @entity3 also could be a bastard			0
@entity2 's book contained numerous examples of @entity3 ' cruel behavior , such as verbally abusing employees whose work did n't meet his exacting standards			1
now a new book is presenting a kinder , gentler portrait of the mercurial tech exec. " becoming @entity3 , " by @entity18 and @entity19 , seeks to humanize @entity3 through interviews with those who knew him in the latter , wildly successful phases of his career , when some of his rough edges had softened			1
the book , which went on sale tuesday , has created a strange irony			0
unlike @entity2 's book , it 's an unauthorized bio , one that was not given @entity3 ' blessing before he died			1
and yet @entity7 , mindful of @entity3 ' legacy , has clearly endorsed this new vision of their former ceo over the @entity2 version			1
" i thought the @entity2 book did him a tremendous disservice			2
it was just a rehash of a bunch of stuff that had already been written , and focused on small parts of his personality , " says current @entity7 ceo @entity40 in the new book			1
" you get the feeling that ( @entity3 's ) a greedy , selfish egomaniac			2
it did n't capture the person			0
the person i read about there is somebody i would never have wanted to work with over all this time			0
" other @entity7 execs also have heaped praise on " becoming @entity3 " while criticizing @entity2 's bestseller			1
" best portrayal is about to be released - becoming @entity3 ( book )			2
well done and first to get it right , " tweeted @entity61 , @entity7 's chief of software , last week			2
and @entity64 , @entity7 's head of design , said in a @entity67 profile last month , " my regard ( for @entity2 's book ) could n't be any lower			1
" @entity2 , for his part , told the @entity71 recently that he tried to present a balanced view of @entity3 : " my book is very favorable and honest , with no anonymous slings , " he said			1
although @entity3 ' life and career have been well chronicled , the new book contains some fresh tidbits : -- in 2009 , when @entity3 was dying of cancer , @entity40 offered his boss a piece of his liver but @entity3 refused , saying , " no , i 'll never let you do that			1
" -- what was likely the last movie @entity3 watched before his death was an odd choice : " @entity89 , " the sentimental @entity91 drama about a racially integrated high school football team in 1971			0
" i was so surprised he wanted to watch that movie , " @entity40 recalled			0
" i was like , ' are you sure ? ' @entity3 was not interested in sports at all			0
" -- and @entity3 ' famous commencement speech at @entity97 in 2005 almost got derailed before it started			0
a police officer turned him and his family away from the campus , saying the parking lot was full , and expressed skepticism that the scruffy @entity3 , wearing his usual jeans and black t - shirt , was really the event 's keynote speaker			0
raves from @entity7 aside , early reviews of " becoming @entity3 " have been mixed			2
" ' becoming @entity3 ' offers a more rounded portrait of the man not only because it does n't lean as heavily on its interviews or stretch for historical weight like @entity2 's book , but because it brings in @entity18 's personal interactions with the @entity7 co-founder , " wrote @entity115 for @entity116			1
" but the closeness of @entity124 's connection with @entity3 is also problematic , " added @entity115 , saying " ... there 's a sense of seeking to explain away bad behavior			0
" " while the book never attempts to portray @entity3 as a saint , it provides ample evidence to suggest that the brash , perpetually impatient young millionaire learned how to control his worst tendencies , eventually becoming a loving father and respected mentor , " wrote @entity125 in 9 to 5 @entity126 " like other good books that have been written about @entity3 , it does n't provide the definitive story of his life , but instead adds some new and interesting details that are worth considering alongside what was previously known			0
