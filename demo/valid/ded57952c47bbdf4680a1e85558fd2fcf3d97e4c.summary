@entity0 is so awesome right now you are probably watching the @entity4 men 's basketball tournament to see who is going to get second			1
the undefeated @entity6 were scary good thursday night in crushing @entity7			1
the score was so lopsided the game was over before the first television timeout			0
while the @entity6 won in a blowout , @entity11 and @entity12 also advanced to the @entity14 with less - than - comfortable wins			1
the @entity16 pulled away from @entity17 while the @entity18 shook off pesky @entity19			1
during the nightcap a lot of televisions -- outside the commonwealth of @entity23 -- probably changed channels			0
the good news was @entity27 and @entity28 played a terrific game in the final contest of the night			0
perhaps you should n't provoke the beast that is @entity23			0
in the week leading up to the game , @entity7 's @entity33 said , " i give them them their props			1
salute them getting to 36 - 0			2
but tomorrow they 're gon na be 36 - 1			2
" mr. @entity33 missed his guaranteed win by miles			0
the @entity6 smoked the @entity42 78 - 39 thursday night in a @entity44 contest that was never a contest			2
@entity0 raced to an 18 - 2 lead -- they should have stopped it then -- and had five players score in double figures on the night			1
@entity49 was the @entity6 ' top scorer with 14 points			0
@entity7 could n't guard anyone , except maybe the official who went down when he tripped over a mountaineer waiting at the scoring table			1
@entity0 's 37 - 0 record is the best start in @entity4 history , which has @entity23 superfan @entity58 super excited			1
it was n't a pretty game for the @entity6 ' offense , but @entity27 scratched its way past @entity28 68 - 60 in a @entity64 semifinal			1
@entity27 shot 40 percent , while @entity28 was n't much better at 43 percent			0
the @entity6 tightened their defense toward the end , closing out with a 19 - 7 run that pushed them to a win and a meeting saturday with @entity12			1
it 's a rematch of an @entity14 game last year , which the @entity18 won by one point			2
@entity74 topped all @entity27 scorers with 17 points while @entity77 led @entity28 with 17 points			2
the @entity16 found the right balance in the second half , putting the @entity81 away for a 81 - 70 victory in the @entity83			1
@entity11 trailed by 1 with 16:43 left when it went on a spurt that saw six different players score as the lead grew to double digits			1
@entity88 , who started the run with back - to - back three - pointers , led the @entity16 with 20 points			1
two - sport star @entity92 had 16			2
@entity93 , who one @entity95 analyst called a baby - faced assassin , chipped in 13 points			0
@entity98 , a national player of the year candidate , had a rough night shooting , so he set up his teammates for buckets instead			0
he had nine points but 11 assists			0
junior @entity104 led the @entity81 with 25 points while @entity106 maneuvered inside for 22			0
@entity12 played cool and shot hot from the free - throw line in holding off @entity19 79 - 72			1
@entity108 was trending on @entity109 but the @entity110 were concerned about @entity111 ( two @entity112 , folks ! ) , the @entity12 forward who was n't having any trouble scoring against the fourth - seeded @entity110			1
@entity111 , who was guarded by the @entity110 ' best defender , @entity116 , sliced his way for 15 first - half points to keep the @entity18 in the game			1
the junior had a career - high 23 points on the night while @entity122 , one of the best players in the country , struggled			0
but the 7 - foot tall center hit a big three and big free throws as the minutes wound down			2
the @entity18 were 20 for 23 from the free throw line			2
@entity122 hit all eight of his attempts			0
folks also got worked up over seeing @entity133 quarterback @entity132 and actress girlfriend @entity134 at the game			0
seems like @entity136 cut to a shot of the two at every break in the action			0
how 'd you like to be the guy next to @entity132 ? he won two @entity145 golf titles , yet is n't famous enough to get all the way in the celebrity fan shot			0
it 's ok , @entity149 .			0

@entity0 *destroys* @entity7
@entity11 's offense gets hot in the second half , led by @entity88
@entity12 holds off @entity155 's @entity19 with superb free - throw shooting
