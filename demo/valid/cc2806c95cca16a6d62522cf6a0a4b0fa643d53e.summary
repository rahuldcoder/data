in september 2002 , then - former @entity1 prime minister @entity0 told a @entity4 congressional committee " there is absolutely no question whatsoever " that @entity8 's @entity7 was developing nuclear weapons at " portable manufacturing sites of mass death			2
" once @entity8 had nuclear weapons , @entity0 warned , " the terror network will have nuclear weapons , " placing " the security of the entire world at risk			0
" fast forward to this week , and @entity0 was back , this time as prime minister , to make virtually identical claims about @entity19			2
yet not only has the @entity4 intelligence community disagreed with @entity0 's assessment of @entity19 nuclear intentions , so does @entity1 's , according to leaked documents			1
indeed , more than 200 retired security officers have publicly criticized @entity0 as a danger to @entity1 's security			0
sadly , @entity0 's presentation reinforces caricatures regularly advanced by @entity4 and @entity30 pundits -- caricatures of @entity19 as aspiring @entity32 hegemon , bent on overthrowing an otherwise stable regional order			1
it 's a misguided perspective that is actually hurting the @entity4			2
in @entity0 's view , @entity4 should only improve relations with an @entity19 that stops its regional " aggression , " its support for " terrorism , " and its " threat [ s ] to annihilate ... @entity1			1
" in other words , @entity4 should not improve relations with an @entity19 whose regional influence is rising			1
in reality , @entity19 's rise is not only normal , it is actually essential to a more stable region			2
as nuclear talks with @entity49 enter a decisive phase , rapprochement with a genuinely independent @entity19 -- not a nominally independent @entity19 whose strategic orientation is subordinated to @entity4 preferences -- is vital to halting the decline of @entity4 's strategic position			1
@entity57 has long worked to consolidate a highly militarized , pro-american @entity32 order			0
yet these efforts -- pursued across @entity61 and @entity62 administrations and intensified after 9/11 -- have clearly failed			0
as a result , the @entity32 today is less stable , more riven with sectarian and ethnic conflict , and more violent than at any point in its modern history			1
and @entity4 , in a textbook illustration of " imperial overstretch , " has made itself weaker , both regionally and globally			0
@entity4 's quest for @entity32 hegemony has failed for many reasons			1
for a start , seeking dominance impels @entity57 to replicate , in multiple venues , its faustian bargain with imperial @entity19 from 1953 until the last shah 's overthrow in 1979 , providing substantial and effectively open - ended support to governments acting against the desires of their own publics			0
while @entity4 elites argue that @entity4 benefits from such arrangements , they are ultimately unsustainable , as @entity19 's 1979 revolution demonstrated			1
a determination to dominate the @entity32 keeps locking @entity57 into these kinds of relationships ; for its own sake , the @entity4 needs to stop trying to be the @entity32 's hegemon			1
that means embracing a regional balance of power -- not the chimera of @entity4 dominance misleadingly labeled as " balance , " but an actual balance in which major regional states , acting in their own interests , constrain one another			1
under any political system , @entity19 would be a significant regional actor , due to its geostrategic location , hydrocarbon resources , and large , educated population			2
but the @entity108 -- which @entity19 built themselves as a participatory @entity110 system representing their interests , not those of rulers beholden to foreign powers -- has a legitimacy @entity4 must accept to foster a truly stable @entity32			1
@entity19 has gained influence in @entity7 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 by backing political structures that , in @entity49 's judgment , will produce governments committed to foreign policy independence			0
@entity57 needs cooperation with just such an @entity19 against common foes like the @entity127 , and to balance counterproductive policies of @entity4 's regional allies			1
@entity57 's self - damaging drive for @entity32 hegemony is inextricably linked to its unconditional support for an increasingly extreme and unrepresentative @entity1			0
a myth prevails that @entity4 's bond with @entity1 flows from " shared democratic values " and response to the @entity137			0
in fact , @entity57 only started providing @entity1 with significant military assistance and diplomatic impunity after the @entity141 , when @entity1 seized pivotal territory from @entity143 and @entity119 , two @entity145 allies opposed to @entity4 regional dominance			2
for the remainder of and after the @entity149 , @entity4 officials calculated that ensuring @entity1 's military superiority over its neighbors helped @entity4 pursue hegemony over the @entity32 , even as occupying millions more @entity153 clearly made @entity1 less democratic			2
( the @entity4 government 's own demographic data show that the number of @entity161 under @entity1 control -- in " @entity163 " @entity1 , @entity164 , the @entity165 , @entity166 and the @entity167 -- exceeds that of @entity1 jews , making the @entity1 state a minority regime for the people it governs )			0
a state representing all these people would not occupy @entity161 populations or seek ever greater freedom of military initiative in its neighborhood			0
@entity1 's pursuit of these policies -- facilitated by @entity4 guarantees of its " qualitative military edge " -- conditions @entity57 's commitment to keeping over 100 million @entity161 under @entity4 - backed autocracies and puts @entity4 on a war footing with an @entity19 unwilling to join this inherently unstable regional order			1
the reality is that @entity1 's concern about @entity19 nuclearization is not that @entity49 will use ( at the moment nonexistent ) nuclear weapons against a nuclear - armed @entity1			0
instead , as then - defense minister @entity189 explained in 2012 , it is that a nuclear @entity19 would " restrict our range of operations			0
" but this is precisely what a truly stable balance of power requires			0
@entity4 needs constructive relations with all major regional states , including @entity19 , so that they constrain one another 's reckless impulses .			1

@entity201 : @entity32 less stable than at any point in modern history
@entity4 needs constructive ties with all major regional states , including @entity19 , she says
