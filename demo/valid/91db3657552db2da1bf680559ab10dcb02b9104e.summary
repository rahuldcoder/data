the sun cuts across @entity2 , casting shadows across lush flora and brightly colored boats			1
rowing in unison , two girls paddle a canoe to school			0
life on @entity2 is peaceful , rustic and isolated , but this could change with the pending completion of a canal that builders are likening to @entity16 's famed waterway			1
headed by @entity18 - based consortium @entity17 ( @entity19 ) , the $ 50 billion @entity20 ( also called the @entity21 and @entity22 ) would create a gargantuan new shipping route through @entity2 by connecting the @entity25 and @entity24			1
@entity19 was granted a 50 - year concession by the @entity28 government in 2013 to build and operate the 278 - kilometer ( 172 miles ) canal , reportedly with the option for an extension			1
construction will run from the @entity33 on the @entity34 to @entity35 on the @entity24			0
at up to 1,700 feet wide and 90 feet deep , the canal , if completed , will be deeper and wider than the @entity37			2
@entity19 announced the start of construction of the canal with a ceremony on december 22 , 2014			2
the canal will run through @entity2 ( among other areas ) , @entity46 's largest lake and freshwater reservoir , which not only preserves an integral part of @entity2 's ecosystem , but directly supports numerous communities			1
by some estimates , 30,000 people will have to be relocated to carve a path for the canal			2
the prospect is nothing short of alarming for those living in the area , and those who cherish its untouched splendor			1
with the pending completion of the canal in 2019 , @entity2 may be impacted in ways only time will reveal			1
environmental experts worry that the shallow waters of the lake wo n't be able to withstand the dredging that will come with construction			1
additionally , communities will likely be displaced and wetlands may become more vulnerable to destruction			0
" in terms of the canal impact on @entity2 , one big concern is the damage to the quality of the water ; the ship traffic will pollute the water with toxic sediments and industrial chemicals and introduce destructive invasive species , plants and animals , " dr. @entity71 , vice president of the @entity28 @entity72 and director of the @entity74 at the @entity75 told @entity1			1
" dredging of the lake for the construction of the canal will render the lake a ' dead zone ' because of hypoxia , eutrophication and turbidity			1
" in january , @entity99 - based scidev.net reported that an independent commission of experts -- including scientists from the @entity103 of @entity72 , @entity104 and @entity105 -- had reached similar conclusions , warning of " unintended adverse consequences that could do economic , environmental and social harm			1
" like other critics of the canal construction , @entity71 wants greater transparency from @entity19 and the @entity28 government			0
" this whole thing has been fast - tracked without public consultations or the opportunity for an informed , documented debate , " said @entity71			0
on january 9 , 2015 , @entity19 responded to concerns about the lake 's impact on communities in a statement on its website			1
" from july 21 to july 30 , 2014 , we and our environmental and social impact advisor , @entity126 ( @entity127 ) , held scoping meetings across @entity2			2
approximately 5,000 people participated in the scoping meetings , including housewives , students , professionals , agricultural producers , fishermen , artisans , businessmen and scholars , " reads the company 's statement , in part			0
the company says it held a press conference broadcast in real time to the public to announce the route of the canal and comment on the technical , geological , cultural and environmental impact of the project			0
some skeptics doubt the hyper - ambitious canal is realistic			2
@entity154 , chairman of civil engineering at @entity156 , has expressed doubts that it will ever be completed			0
he worries that it will be abandoned			0
his greatest concern is severe damage to @entity2			2
despite the concerns of environmental experts , the project is underway , making a visit to this beautiful area more compelling than ever			2
largely unmarred by development , @entity2 is a sight to behold			1
during my recent guided visit with @entity171 , i took a boat tour through the @entity173 , home to 365 scattered islands with majestic views of @entity178 volcano			0
at times , there was no other boat in sight -- only the rustle of a hidden howler monkey in the bushes and the volcano , ensconced in clouds and morning fog			0
the feeling of being everywhere and nowhere at once is part of @entity2 's charm			1
another part of its charm is the people who live on it			0
at @entity197 on @entity2 , about 90 children canoe to school each day			2
@entity199 works with @entity197 to bring clean water to the children and educational projects that encourage sustainability on the lake			0
guests of the lodge can arrange visits			0
the islets are just southeast of the city of @entity212 ( population approximately 120,000 ) , where colonial buildings defy time , narrow alleyways lead to garden courtyards , charming boutiques are full of local art and street carts overflow with everything from iguanas to cashews			0
while @entity212 pulses with @entity223 charm , @entity2 stands still with nature as its compass , mostly untouched by modernity			1
