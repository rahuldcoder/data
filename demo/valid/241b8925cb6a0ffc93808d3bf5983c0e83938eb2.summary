" @entity1 's daughter , " the @entity4 documentary about the infamous 2012 gang rape in @entity6 , premiered in the @entity7 last week			1
if you have n't seen it , you have likely heard selections from the film 's interview with @entity13 , who is on death row for the crime			0
" a decent girl wo n't roam around at nine o'clock at night			0
a girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy , " he says			0
" when being raped , she should n't fight back			2
she should just be silent			0
" certain other men interviewed for the documentary say such things as , " in our culture , there is no place for a woman " and that if a daughter or sister " engaged in pre-marital activities ... i would put petrol on her and set her alight			2
" note : those men are not rapist - murderers			2
many ( i 'd like to think most ) of us cringed at these comments and their garishly clear misogyny			1
but these words were not just a window into one uniquely deranged soul			0
let 's be clear : @entity13 is just reading -- perhaps more loudly and cruelly than others , but still -- from a cultural script we all share			0
perhaps your first thought when you heard or read those words was , " violence against women is really bad ... in @entity1			1
" and in many ways , of course , it is			0
reports this weekend of a robbery at a @entity59 school in eastern @entity1 , in which , officials said , one of the assailants allegedly raped a 70 - year - old nun , add to the narrative			1
but as unfathomable as this brutality is , we must resist the temptation to presume some sort of @entity7 violence - against - women exceptionalism , making others the bad guys while crowing about " how far women have come " in the @entity7			1
or to say , " sure , we still have issues , but not like that			0
" i know that temptation is there			0
our global human rights organization , based in the @entity7 and @entity1 , works to inspire individuals and institutions to drive the culture change needed to make violence against women unacceptable			1
when i describe our work -- including our campaigns and issues in both countries and beyond -- the questions people ask often reveal their at least initial assumption : that we here in the @entity7 are working solely to stop violence against women in @entity1			1
yet we do have issues in the @entity7 , issues " like that			1
" we have mass murderer @entity92 , who before he killed six people and injured 14 others in @entity96 last year , wrote his own 137 - page version of that same misogynist script			0
we know from " the @entity99 , " documentarian @entity101 's film about sexual assault on college campuses -- also now in theaters -- that multitudes of women , and many men , have had violated their right to an education free from violence			1
we know that women are leaving the tech industry , @entity114 , and internet feminism in droves due to untenable discrimination and violence			1
we know that women ( and people of all genders ) are assaulted by strangers and intimates every day			2
and what of the response ? as @entity129 noted , discussing " @entity1 's daughter " in @entity131 , " from @entity1 to the @entity7 , citizens and officials alike display a troubling inclination to sympathize with rapists and vilify their victims			1
" a @entity135 report released last week , marking the 20th anniversary of the landmark women 's rights conference in @entity138 , confirms that ( as the @entity142 put it ) " violence against women -- including rape , murder and sexual harassment -- remains stubbornly high in countries rich and poor , at war and at peace			1
we ca n't relegate such violence to " the other , " to the " not here , not us , not me			2
" to do so is not only incorrect , it is damaging			0
yes , we must be concerned for the human rights of all the world 's citizens			0
yes , violence against women varies in form and degree			2
but to imagine that violence against women happens only , or mostly , " somewhere else , " is exactly what keeps the culture of violence alive at home			1
concern for others does not absolve us of responsibility for ourselves			0
likewise , the extreme actions or words of a few marquee misogynists , wherever they live , do not absolve us			0
we must all ask ourselves : to what degree do we repeat those scripts , or stay silent when we hear them from others ? our actions , and inactions , fuel the culture from which both extreme and everyday violence and discrimination emerge			2
we can not furrow our brows about @entity1 , or any of those " others " -- abusive men in fraternities , for example -- and be done			2
indeed , " @entity1 's daughter " premiered in the @entity7 with the intent of drawing attention to gender inequality and sexual violence worldwide			1
so let 's bring about the day when the next buzzworthy documentary is about the women and men and allies of all genders who have stepped up , together , to say no more : not in my home , not in my school , not in my country , not anywhere .			0

@entity202 : we react in *horror* at comments in @entity4 doc where @entity1 rapist says women err in fighting back
but she says @entity7 should look inward at their own *tolerance* for violence against women , *demonstrated* in *sobering* assault stats
@entity202 : we dodge *accountability* for misogyny and sexual abuse in our own culture by *focusing* on countries that are " the other "
