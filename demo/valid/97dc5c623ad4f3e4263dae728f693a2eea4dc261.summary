before he was @entity2 , he was little @entity2 -- a young version of the same @entity4 who authorities say later became the @entity7 - speaking face of @entity9 terror			1
his earlier , innocent image can be seen in video obtained from @entity14 's @entity13			0
it shows a teenage boy in the schoolyard of a @entity19 secondary school			1
he walks through a sea of fellow students in his zippered sweatshirt over his polo shirt , wearing a backpack and carrying a plastic bottle			0
at one point , a basketball rolls toward him and he returns it with a deft kick			0
he looks playful at times as when he skips and lightheartedly pushes two other boys , more serious in others			2
in other words , he appears to be not much different than any other teenager			0
the boy in the video is @entity4 , his former headmaster at @entity38 told @entity0			1
who @entity4 used to be @entity40 noted that her former student could be shy at times , but overall he was far from a troublemaker and not much out of the ordinary			2
" he was bullied a little bit , because he was quiet and reserved , " @entity40 said			0
" generally , he was fine			0
there ( were ) no issues with him			0
" @entity4 became even more focused in his last few years at @entity38 , she said			2
" he was working hard , he achieved great grades for him , and he went to the university of his choice , " @entity40 told @entity0 this week , referring to @entity19 's @entity51 , from which @entity4 graduated in 2009			1
contrast that perception with that of the masked , deep - voiced , @entity14 - accented man who months ago was dubbed @entity2			2
there is nothing shy , nothing gentle , nothing playful about him			0
he starred in grisly @entity9 videos depicting the beheading of hostages , punctuating his horrific actions with taunts at the @entity68			1
a man who says he is @entity4 's father told the @entity71 newspaper @entity70 that " there is nothing that proves " the man known as @entity2 is his son , @entity74			1
his @entity71 - based lawyer , @entity75 , told @entity0 that the family plans to sue anyone who makes the connection , calling the father @entity81 a " victim of libel			0
" yet @entity83 authorities have made just such a link			0
they say that the @entity71 - born @entity4 went from being a typical " boy next door " type growing up in @entity19 to being one of the most high - profile recruits of @entity9 , the @entity89 extremist group behind a campaign of terror and conquest in @entity93 and @entity94			1
more than a dozen @entity14 administrative court documents obtained by @entity0 indicate that , as far back as 2009 , @entity14 security services believed @entity4 was part of a radical @entity19 recruitment network for terrorist groups in @entity101			1
and in late february , two @entity68 officials and two @entity68 congressional sources confirmed reports in @entity14 and other media that @entity4 went on to join @entity9 and is the man known as @entity2 .			1

video shows a young @entity4 in a @entity19 schoolyard
he covers his face at times , skips and playfully *jostles* with students at others
@entity68 authorities say @entity4 grew up to be the @entity9 terrorist known as @entity2
