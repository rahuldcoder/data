the @entity1 does n't just do stuff " for fun , " says the command master chief of the aircraft carrier @entity6 , but what 30 % of the ship 's crew will be up to over the next year or so can at least be termed pretty cool			2
and it will certainly be unprecedented			0
some 1,200 of the @entity6 's crew will be executing what the @entity1 calls a three - hull swap , serving aboard three different carriers in one tour of duty as the service juggles assets to meet mission requirements			1
the 1,200 are calling themselves " the three presidents crew , " as they will serve aboard three of the @entity1 's carriers named after presidents : the @entity6 , the @entity24 @entity23 and the @entity25			1
the crew will even have its own insignia and hull number , @entity30 220 , the sum of the hull numbers of the @entity6 ( @entity30 76 ) , the @entity33 ( @entity30 71 ) and the @entity23 ( @entity30 73 )			2
@entity35 3rd @entity34 aboard the @entity6 came up with the logo			2
" i am honored that my art will be a part of the legacy of this ' three presidents ' crew , and i hope that it will bring attention to the hard work of all the sailors who are involved in this crew swap , " he said			1
the swap will begin this summer			0
the @entity23 will go from its home port in @entity50 to @entity51 , where a crew swap with the @entity6 will take place			1
while the @entity23 crew takes the @entity6 to replace the @entity23 in @entity50 , the @entity55 crew will board the @entity23 , which will be headed for @entity57 , @entity58 , and an overhaul			1
the 1,200 will sail with the @entity23 around @entity61 , then they will fly back to @entity51 to crew the @entity25 , which is taking the @entity6 's current spot there			1
" think of how difficult a three - hull carrier swap would be to carry out , " capt. @entity65 , the commander of the @entity6 , said in the ship 's publication , the 76er			1
" it 's never been done before			0
" " we are just moving assets around so we can continue to meet mission requirements			0
that 's exactly what this is all about			0
it 's not because the @entity1 said , ' let 's do this for fun , ' " @entity82 , command master chief of the @entity6 , said in the 76er			0
seven of the @entity1 's 10 active aircraft carriers are named after presidents			2
as one commenter on the @entity6 's @entity89 page said , maybe next time , the @entity1 could add a fourth carrier to the hull swap and come up with ... the @entity92			1
hmmm , the @entity1 does have the @entity93 ( @entity30 72 ) , but there is no carrier for @entity96			0
so say we sub in the @entity6 and come up with @entity30			0
apologies to the @entity99 ( @entity100 47 ) .			0
