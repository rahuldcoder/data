in the documentary , titled " @entity7 : @entity81 , " @entity0 said @entity3 had had no choice but to act			1
" @entity7 is n't just any territory for us , it is historically @entity1 territory , " he said			1
@entity7 , a @entity87 peninsula that has been part of @entity42 since 1954 , has a majority @entity1 population and strong cultural and historical ties to @entity1			1
it is also home to @entity1 's @entity87 fleet , at the @entity96 naval base			2
but @entity0 said he had never thought of " dismembering " the peninsula from @entity42 until @entity43 's ouster			2
" we can not leave this area and the people who live there to whims of fate , to let the people of @entity7 be thrown under the wheels of this nationalist bulldozer , " he said			2
" i set certain tasks			0
i did say what and how we should do , but immediately stressed that we would do so only if we are absolutely convinced that the people who live in the @entity7 want it			2
" the vast majority of people who voted in the referendum approved secession from @entity42			0
but the vote , staged while armed men controlled the region , was dismissed as illegal by @entity42 's then - interim government in @entity119 , the @entity120 and the @entity121			0

" it is important that we work for a peaceful solution , and we will not give up before the full sovereignty and territorial integrity of @entity42 has been restored , " she said			0
" this not only includes @entity7 but also now in our daily work the areas around @entity141 and @entity142			2
" unrest broke out in @entity42 's eastern @entity142 and @entity141 regions following @entity1 's absorbing of @entity7			1
a fragile truce is currently in place but the conflict between @entity151 separatists and @entity42 forces there has claimed thousands of lives			0
@entity126 warned that the @entity120 was ready to impose more sanctions if necessary against @entity1 interests to help ensure that a peace plan hammered out in @entity157 , @entity158 , last month is fully implemented			1
@entity0 told the documentary - makers he was certain the @entity121 was behind the ouster of @entity43 , which @entity3 views as an illegal armed coup			1
" formally , the opposition was primarily supported by @entity131 , but we knew very well ... that the real puppeteers were our @entity121 partners and friends			0
it was them who helped prepare nationalists ( and ) combat troops , " he said			0
he also said that sanctions should have been imposed against those who orchestrated what he called a coup , rather than those involved in @entity7 's annexation			0
@entity0 insisted in remarks to reporters last month that there was no chance @entity7 would be returned to @entity42			1
and it appears @entity1 is taking no chances			0
in the documentary , @entity0 said @entity1 's @entity187 high - precision coastal missile defense systems had been deployed to @entity7 to protect the territory -- " in such a way that they were seen perfectly well from outer space			1
" this can only be done following a decision by the supreme commander in chief , he said			0
