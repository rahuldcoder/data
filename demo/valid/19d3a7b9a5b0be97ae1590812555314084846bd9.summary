@entity3 , @entity4 an @entity2 - @entity1 man is found hanging from a tree in the @entity4 woods with bedsheets around his neck attached to a limb 15 feet above the ground			1
there 's no chair in sight			1
his feet are 2 to 3 feet off the ground			1
his hands are not bound			1
is this a suicide ? or is it a lynching -- a shadow from the @entity25 's history of racial violence re-emerging ? those were the big questions friday , one day after authorities found a man 's body with bedsheets around his neck in @entity3 , a small town of just over 1,500 people in rural @entity34 , about 60 miles southwest of @entity35 , the state capital			2
evidence collected so far does n't suggest foul play in the death , law enforcement officials said			1
for that reason , suicide is the early theory as the likely manner of death , the officials said			1
@entity34 sheriff @entity47 on friday identified the man as @entity49			2
even though authorities have confirmed his name , they still have a lot of work ahead to figure out how @entity49 died and who is responsible			2
" it could take a week , it could take two weeks , it could take months , " @entity47 said			1
authorities expect to receive a preliminary report next week on what caused @entity49 's death , @entity61 , special agent in charge of the @entity65 office in @entity35 , said friday afternoon at a press conference			1
he said 30 agents from the @entity65 , the @entity67 and other agencies are looking for friends and family of the victim " that might help paint a picture on the cause of death of mr. @entity49			1
" agents have finished searching the area where the body was found and are looking at a " storage location " @entity49 owned that might yield information , @entity61 said			2
@entity61 said the @entity65 is communicating with the family and wo n't comment on rumors circulating about the death			1
" the community deserves answers , " he said			2
" the family deserves answers			2
" the body was found at 10:21 a.m. thursday , deep in a forest about 500 yards from the house @entity49 was renting , according to @entity47			2
a skullcap had been pulled over his head , the sheriff said			2
that house was the last place where @entity49 had been seen on march 2 , according to the sheriff			2
he was reported missing a week later , spurring a search			1
the body was found by staffers from the @entity100 who were taking part in the search , @entity47 said			2
thursday was the first time authorities looked specifically in the wooded area where the body was found , according to the sheriff			0
a family member who did not want to be identified said @entity49 was not acting out of the ordinary in the days before he went missing			0
he went to church , he worked and occasionally ventured to a casino , according to the family member , who described @entity49 as a " good , hardworking man			0
" @entity49 had been in prison			0
he was convicted in 1980 of murdering a woman , but was paroled in 2006 , according to the @entity115			0
no one has given any indication publicly whether @entity49 had enemies			0
what distinguishes a suicidal hanging from a lynching ? @entity122 , a veteran crime scene investigator and president of @entity124 , said he knew nothing about the @entity4 case but had investigated other deaths by hanging or strangulation			0
injuries to the dead person indicate lynching , he said , because it means the dead person struggled with other people before being hanged			0
when people are strangled by somebody else , investigators sometimes find the deceased has grabbed at the ligature and left finger marks and even bits of fingernails around his neck , he said			0
the direction of the ligature is another indicator , @entity122 said			0
when people hang themselves , the rope often rides up directly behind the ears , he said			0
when a person is hanged by other people , the ligature moves differently on the neck , he said			0
@entity122 said these are general observations and that " the facts are what make or break the case			0
" @entity4 @entity158 chapter president @entity156 issued a statement calling on " federal authorities to immediately investigate the hanging death of mr. @entity49			1
" the @entity65 already is looking into any federal civil rights violations and has a forensics team on the scene			1
the @entity1 @entity167 @entity166 and @entity168 for the @entity169 are also investigating , according to a spokeswoman for the @entity167			0
the @entity67 also is investigating			0
@entity65 supervisory special agent @entity171 told @entity172 that " it 's too early to say what happened or speculate about the cause or the manner " of death			1
" we do n't know what happened out there , " @entity171 said			1
" we do n't know if it was a suicide , if it was a homicide			1
that 's why we investigate these types of cases			0
" @entity47 , who is himself african - american , said friday that he 's worried people will jump to the conclusion that @entity49 was murdered and that race was a factor			0
" i do n't want the community to go excited saying it was a white - on - black thing			1
that 's the worst thing that can happen , is people making it into a race issue , " @entity47 said			0
" and that 's my biggest fear			0
and i do n't want that to happen			1
@entity5 's @entity200 and @entity201 reported from @entity4 , and @entity5 's @entity202 wrote this story from @entity204			0
@entity5 's @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207 contributed to this report .			1
