although much of the @entity2 has been shivering this winter , there 's been another worrying sign of warming temperatures farther north			0
the cap of sea ice that spreads across the @entity7 in winter appears to have been the smallest on record this year , according to @entity8			1
not only was this year 's maximum extent , reached on february 25 , the smallest on the satellite record , it 's also one of the earliest			2
barring a late spurt of ice growth -- possible but unlikely , according to a @entity8 news release -- this sets a new precedent			2
the analysis is based on data from the @entity8 - supported @entity20 ( @entity20 ) at the @entity21			0
@entity7 sea ice , frozen seawater floating on top of the @entity7 and its neighboring seas , is in a state of constant flux			1
it increases its area in winter , usually peaking between late february and early april , and then shrinks in the warmth of spring and summer to reach its lowest extent in september			2
if this year 's maximum extent , totaling 5.61 million square miles , was reached on february 25 , it was reached 15 days earlier than the 1981 to 2010 average date of march 12 , according to @entity20			1
only once before did the peak come earlier , by just one day in 1996			0
a peak of 5.61 million square miles is about 50,000 square miles below the previous lowest peak wintertime extent , reached in 2011 , according to @entity20			1
scientists have been using satellite data to track changes in @entity7 sea ice , a vital habitat for birds and marine mammals such as polar bears , seals and walruses , for over three decades			1
according to the @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity20 lead scientist , puts the potentially record low maximum sea ice extent this year down to low ice extent in the @entity54 and a late drop in ice extent in the @entity57			1
strong southerly winds in early march also played a role , according to @entity50			0
only the @entity61 and the waters around @entity63 had more ice than normal this winter , it said			0
scientists say it does n't necessarily follow that a low maximum winter extent will mean a record amount of shrinkage in sea ice over the summer , however			1
while the winter sea ice extent was low in 2006 and 2011 , neither of those years saw an unusually low summer minimum , @entity50 said			1
" the winter maximum gives you a head start , but the minimum is so much more dependent on what happens in the summer that it seems to wash out anything that happens in the winter , " @entity74 , a sea ice scientist at @entity8 's @entity76 in @entity77 , @entity78 , is quoted as saying by @entity8			2
" if the summer is cool , the melt rate will slow down			0
and the opposite is true , too : even if you start from a fairly high point , warm summer conditions make ice melt fast			0
" this was highlighted by 2012 , when we had one of the later maximums on record and extent was near - normal early in the melt season , but still the 2012 minimum was by far the lowest minimum we 've seen			0
" meanwhile , the summer minimum ice extent reached in the @entity102 was one of the highest recorded , @entity50 said			0
but this is n't cause for much optimism faced with evidence of a warming planet			0
" over the span of the satellite record , @entity7 sea ice has been declining significantly , while sea ice in the @entity102 has increased very slightly , " the @entity50 news release said			1
" recent research demosntrates that the @entity102 gains do not balance out the @entity7 losses : globally , sea ice extent has decreased over the past several decades			1
" according to the @entity20 , sea ice in the @entity7 appears to play a more important role in regulating global temperatures than that in the @entity102 .			2

scientists say @entity7 sea ice appears to have set a record low maximum extent this winter
barring an unlikely late surge in sea ice growth , the 2015 maximum is 5.61 million square miles
