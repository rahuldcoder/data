wednesday 's terrorist attack , which killed 23 people , hit @entity3 where it hurt by targeting its flourishing tourism industry			1
the deadly attack on the prominent @entity6 near @entity3 's parliament in the country 's capital , @entity10 , is the latest instance of an armed assault carried out by gunmen willing to fight to the death , a tactic that has been widely adopted by jihadist terrorists in recent years , including in @entity17			1
such attacks mimic the 2008 @entity20 assaults in which 10 gunmen from @entity22 went on a rampage in the massive @entity25 port city			2
they took hostages and killed more than 160 people over a three - day period , in an attack that drew sustained global tv coverage			2
the gunmen attacked iconic @entity20 targets such as the @entity34 hotel , which is frequented by @entity35			0
the @entity20 gunmen embarked on their attack knowing that it was a " fedayeen " mission -- meaning " those who sacrifice themselves " -- and that they would probably fight to the death			2
in this week 's @entity3 attack , the gunmen took hostages , two gunmen died in the assault , and three survived and are being hunted by the @entity3 government			1
@entity3 prime minister @entity49 said the attackers at the @entity6 had specifically targeted tourists to hurt the country 's economy			2
this seems a likely outcome of the attack , as tourism is vital to @entity3 's economy , providing 15 % of gdp			1
@entity3 is also the only country where the @entity60 produced a successful , lasting democratic transition , making it attractive to tourists who are avoiding going to countries like @entity65 , which did not weather the @entity60 as well as @entity3			1
already , some tour companies are canceling excursions to @entity10			0
in january , in @entity3 's neighbor @entity70 , the local branch of @entity69 mounted a similar attack on the upscale @entity73 in the capital , @entity75			2
two gunmen , one of them a @entity3 , killed 10 people , including an @entity77			2
both gunmen died in the attack			0
this attack served @entity69 ' purposes of sowing greater instability in @entity70 and expunging @entity84 influence from the country , as the hotel was where many foreign businessmen stayed			0
a senior @entity77 official told one of us that the @entity77 intelligence community estimates that jihadist terrorist groups such as @entity69 now control a twelfth of the landmass of @entity70 , which is one of the largest countries on the @entity17 continent			0
this is a sobering finding for @entity3 , which had been largely immune from the kinds of terrorist attacks that have recently plagued @entity70 and other @entity17 countries			1
while the museum attack in @entity3 and the hotel attack in @entity70 may help terrorist groups to achieve their strategic goals , more often than not , armed assaults by terrorists against so - called soft targets such as hotels , supermarkets and malls do not achieve much beyond the tactical successes of global news coverage and causing mayhem			1
in september 2013 , @entity115 , the @entity116 affiliate , killed 67 people in a fedayeen - style armed assault on the @entity119 in @entity120 , @entity121			1
four gunmen carried out the attack , which unspooled over a four - day period			0
the @entity119 attack received much global news coverage and was designed to put pressure on the @entity121 government , which had sent troops to @entity130 to fight @entity115			0
however , a year and a half after the attack on the mall , @entity115 continues to lose territory in @entity130 , and the @entity121 military has continued to battle the terrorist group			0
the plague of @entity20 - style armed assaults by jihadist terrorists is not confined to @entity17			1
in january , @entity20 - style tactics were used in @entity141 when @entity142 and @entity143 and @entity144 conducted armed assaults on the satirical magazine @entity146 and a kosher supermarket over a three - day period			1
all three gunmen were killed			0
in a videotape , @entity144 said @entity69 inspired him			0
the @entity141 attacks received considerable coverage around the world but had no impact on @entity156 's willingness to continue its involvement in coalition airstrikes against @entity69 .			0

@entity3 weathered the @entity60 and has been *buoyed* by its tourism industry
*authors* : the fedayeen - style attacks are an effort to spread fear and weaken the nation
