among demonstrators ' demands : that the @entity29 release the name of the officer who shot @entity22			0

the chief adds , " we needed to release that at the same time we needed to release the name of the officer involved in the shooting , " though he does n't elaborate on why critics accuse him of inflaming tensions rather than getting the situation under control			1

" " overnight i went from being a small - town police chief to being part of a conversation about racism , equality and the role of policing in that conversation , " he says in the video			1
" as chief of police , i want to be part of that conversation			2
i also want to be part of the solution			0
" that night , he meets with protesters , agreeing to march with them			0

and i 've been working with a lot of community members to work on some progressive changes that will bring the community together and to open up dialogue and getting us all talking about serious issues and actually creating solutions to problems , " he says			0
" so , yes , i think i can -- i think i can see this through and come out on the other side with the community , the region and even the country a whole lot better			0
" the @entity9 slams the @entity105 for tactics that federal investigators say targeted @entity24			0
