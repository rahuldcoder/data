when @entity2 writer @entity1 was hacked to death on a @entity5 , @entity6 , street in full view of horrified onlookers , blogger @entity0 doubled down			1
fundamentalists were choking free thought in his secular nation , he wrote			1
but they could n't silence it			1
his friends warned him to be careful , to watch what he posted online			1
but @entity0 dismissed those concerns , saying his @entity19 profile page did n't even bear his picture			1
they do n't even know what i look like , he told them			1
on monday , the 27 - year - old @entity0 fell victim to the same brazen act that killed @entity1 , hacked to death by two men with knives and meat cleavers just outside his house as he headed to work at a travel agency			1
he was so maimed -- with wounds to his head , face and neck -- that police identified him through the voter identification card he was carrying			1
his death was the second time in five weeks that someone was killed in @entity5 for online posts critical of @entity43 -- but they are hardly the only two who 've paid a steep price			1
in the last two years , several bloggers have died , either murdered or under mysterious circumstances			2
" the despicable murder of @entity1 last month should have led authorities to step up protection measures for bloggers and others at risk			1
the killing of @entity0 today is another clear example of the @entity6 government 's utter failure to ensure the safety of those at risk , " said @entity54 of @entity55			1
" how many more bloggers will have to be attacked before action is taken ? " as shocking as @entity0 's death was , the reaction from some quarters was equally disturbing			1
on his @entity19 page ( for which he picked a custom url that translates to " unbeliever " ) , @entity0 had posted a picture with the hashtag # @entity71			1
after his death , someone left a comment , " now you are			2
" another wrote , " i felt sorry when i first learned of your death			2
but then i saw what you wrote and i am not			2
" on his page , @entity0 reposted a cartoon depicting @entity82 from the @entity84 satire magazine @entity83			1
he wished a happy birthday to author @entity86 , who was forced to flee @entity6 due to death threats from fundamentalists			2
and he " liked " a picture of sausages wrapped in crescent rolls that someone had captioned , " pigs in burqas			2
" posts threatening him were numerous			2
" get ready for the afterlife , " one person commented on one of his posts			2
" see you in hell , " said another			2
he used to write under the pseudonym " @entity103 " on a blog but switched to posting on @entity19 after 2011			2
on @entity19 , he is credited for a series , " @entity107 - crushing answers to insulting comments of atheists			1
" there , he posted questions that critics of @entity43 often raised and then answered them			2
but he paired the answers in such a way that they highlighted the contradiction within @entity43			2
for example , one question asked what proof was there that the @entity120 was the word of @entity121			0
the answer , " @entity82 said in his own words that the @entity120 is the word of @entity121			0
since @entity82 is the messenger of @entity125 , his claims are true			0
" he placed the question next to one that asked , " what is the proof that @entity82 was the messenger of @entity125 ? " the answer , " the @entity120 claims that @entity82 was the messenger of @entity125			0
and since the @entity120 is @entity121 's word , its claims must be true			0
" @entity131 , a blogger who himself was wounded by machete - wielding attackers in 2013 but survived , remembered @entity0 as a great satirist			1
" i named him the @entity135 of @entity6 , " he told the @entity134			0
" he wanted with all his heart , a true secular country , where everyone can practice their freedom			0
" the irony is that the people who killed @entity0 were n't even familiar with his writings ; they were simply following orders , police said			1
of the three involved in the monday morning attack , two were quickly caught by bystanders			0
in confessions to police , the pair -- both students at @entity43 schools -- said they did n't know what a blog was , nor had they seen @entity0 's writing			1
they said they were acting on orders from another person who told them killing @entity0 was a religious duty , police commissioner @entity156 told reporters			1
the third person is still to be apprehended			0
that appears to be par for the course in the killings of bloggers in @entity6			0
the only person arrested in the killing of @entity1 , the @entity2 blogger , is @entity169 , who had called for his death in @entity19 posts			1
there has been no conviction in the january 2013 attack on @entity131			0
and no convictions in yet another case -- the hacking death of blogger @entity178 , also in 2013			0
" the @entity6 government must urgently establish accountability in this murder case and others , " the @entity179 to @entity180 said after @entity0 's death			1
" otherwise the rest of the country 's bloggers , commentators and journalists covering sensitive topics remain at grave risk of being attacked as well			0
" bloggers , unlike political parties , are n't an organized force -- and that makes them an easy target for radicals , said @entity199 , who heads the @entity200 in @entity6			0
" they want peace , they talk of humanity			0
if you strike them with stones , they do n't strike back			0
they try to reach you with flowers , " he said			0
" so , if you want to sow fear and stifle progressive thought , they are easy to pick on			0
" but the deaths -- of @entity0 , of @entity1 , of @entity178 -- have emboldened the movement , rather than chill them into silence			1
" no one is cowering in their homes because this is happening			0
because this has been happening regularly for a long time , " he said			0
" we want to take the society forward			0
we know we have a lot left to accomplish			0
" @entity9 's @entity227 , @entity228 and @entity229 contributed to this report .			0
