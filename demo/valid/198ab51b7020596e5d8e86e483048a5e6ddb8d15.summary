@entity1 , @entity2 sen. @entity0 , the conservative firebrand from @entity5 , became the first @entity6 to announce his campaign for the presidency , and he spent monday morning telling a crowd at the largest @entity11 university in the world to imagine what the country will be like when he takes office , and pitching his personal history as a key part of his campaign			1
" these are all of our stories , " @entity0 told the audience monday , roaming around the circular stage at @entity21 , in @entity1 , @entity2 , opening his remarks by spotlighting his family history and his own path to @entity25			1
" these are who we are as @entity31			0
and yet for so many @entity31 , the promise of @entity31 seems more and more distant			0
" @entity0 drew on the past only to focus on the future , repeatedly and emphatically asking the @entity21 student audience to " imagine " the @entity31 under conservative leadership -- laying out his vision for the country and a @entity0 presidency			1
the senator from @entity5 , who burst into the national limelight with his staunch opposition to @entity42 and his willingness to shut down the federal government , presents a direct challenge to the expected bids of establishment republicans such as @entity49 gov. @entity48 -- candidates @entity0 coyly refers to as the " mushy middle			1
" monday 's event was the last part of a carefully coordinated media rollout , following @entity0 's announcement of his candidacy in a 30 - second video message posted on @entity59 shortly after midnight on monday , roughly 24 hours after the @entity52 first reported his planned announcement			1
ten thousand students from @entity21 crowded into the university 's main arena for @entity0 's announcement			1
the venue choice at this socially conservative campus aims to give @entity0 an early boost among evangelical voters , who will be key to boosting presidential hopefuls in states like @entity71 and @entity72 that have early nominating contests			1
it was a youthful crowd , as students are required to attend the @entity21 's tri-weekly convocation address			1
not all in the audience were guaranteed @entity0 supporters : several attendees sported red " stand with @entity6 " shirts , repping @entity80 @entity6 sen. @entity6 , who is slated to announce his candidacy early next month			1
@entity84 , the university 's president and son of its founder and evangelical icon , introduced @entity0 as a senator who " has gone against the tide " and a " man of great character , " all while stressing that the university does not endorse candidates for office			1
@entity84 picked up on @entity0 's assertion that millions of evangelical @entity97 did not vote in 2012 , pointing out that " if any candidate can energize that group , it will make a huge difference in any national race			1
" asked after the speech how he prepared for the event , @entity0 said he " spent some time in prayer " thinking about the message he wants to convey			1
" at the end of the day it 's listening to the people about the vision for turning the country around , " @entity0 told @entity3 , adding that he was " incredibly " encouraged and inspired by the support			1
@entity0 's announcement came on the five - year anniversary of the passage of the @entity42 , also known as @entity42 , which @entity0 has fought in the @entity115 to repeal			1
@entity0 marked the anniversary by pledging to repeal " every word " of the healthcare law as president			1
@entity0 also jabbed at @entity121 education standards -- which @entity48 supports -- and repeated his pledge to abolish the @entity123 , instead suggesting @entity31 could file their taxes on a postcard			1
and @entity0 drew the longest and loudest applause from the audience when he prompted the audience to " imagine a president who stands unapologetically with the nation of @entity131			1
" @entity0 's advisers envision a three - pronged strategy that focuses on dominating the @entity135 faction and competing in the libertarian and @entity11 conservative circles			1
a constant and vocal critic of the @entity140 administration , @entity0 is perhaps best known for his stalwart fight against @entity42 in 2013 , which led to a tense standoff between @entity143 and @entity6 and ultimately resulted in a 17 - day government shutdown			1
the showdown was punctuated by @entity0 's 21 - hour speech on the @entity115 floor			1
while popular in conservative and tea party circles , @entity0 has a long way to go in terms of broader support in the @entity6 base , according to public opinion polls			2
a @entity3 / @entity155 survey conducted this month on the hypothetical @entity6 primary showed @entity0 came in with 4 % support among @entity6 and independents who lean @entity6			2
but the field is still relatively open , with the top contender -- @entity48 -- coming in at 16 % support , followed by @entity162 at 13 %			0
but @entity0 has relatively strong favorability numbers			2
according to a recent @entity165 poll , he is viewed in a positive light by 45 % of @entity6 , compared with only 8 % who do n't have a favorable opinion of him			0
still , 46 % say they have n't heard enough about him to form an opinion			0
@entity171 , an adviser to @entity0 's campaign , confirmed that the campaign 's fund - raising target is $ 40 million , and the campaign believes it can raise $ 1 million in the first week			2
@entity0 this month finished an early - voting state tour to @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity177 -- and he 's scheduled to return to @entity177 on march 28 to speak at a brunch in @entity179			2
depending on the @entity115 schedule this week , he could possibly make more early - state trips , according to advisers			0
after his speech monday , he 'll head up to @entity184 for media appearances and a fund - raiser			0
@entity0 developed a loyal following when he won his 2012 primary battle in @entity5 as a little - known candidate , forcing then - lt. gov. @entity190 into a surprise runoff and ultimately defeating the establishment @entity6			2
along with two other first - term senators who are expected to run for president ( @entity6 and @entity195 ) , @entity0 will likely face questions over experience , an issue that @entity6 brought up in 2008 against @entity140 , who was also a first - term senator at the time			2
before running for the @entity115 in 2012 -- his first campaign for public office -- @entity0 was solicitor general of @entity5 and argued before the @entity202			2
he graduated from @entity203 and @entity204			0
born in @entity205 to a @entity207 father and @entity31 mother , @entity0 was a dual citizen until he renounced @entity205 citizenship in 2014			2
he faced questions over whether he would qualify for the presidency , though law experts consider him a natural - born citizen because he was born to an @entity31 mother			0
@entity0 was swarmed by students and reporters after he descended the stage and started to exit the arena			2
he took photos and signed autographs for about a half hour , as his team tried to escort him through the crowd			0
one girl who was raising money selling baked goods offered to give @entity0 a dozen cupcakes for free but he pulled out his wallet and gave her $ 20			0
a pair of enthusiastic sisters shouted out to @entity0 to tell him that , like his own daughters , they were also named @entity231 and @entity232 and were two years apart			0
" that 's just cool , " he said , as he gave them both high fives			0
" one student who said she was @entity238 said she and her whole family were behind him			0
" you have the @entity238 vote , " she joked , then proceeded to start talking to him @entity240			0
while @entity0 's father is @entity207 , he 's not fluent in @entity240			0
" we grew up speaking @entity245			0
my grandmother would be like ' @entity250 , throw me the remote control ' , " he said this is who we are as a people			0
we got to tell that story , " @entity0 said			0
@entity3 's @entity253 and @entity254 contributed to this report .			0
