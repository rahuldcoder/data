@entity7 a @entity10 " dream ticket , " two nuggets about leadership questions in @entity2 and coming tests for sen. @entity4 and @entity6 gov. @entity5 filled our final march trip around the " @entity14 " table			1
another " @entity16 " movement ? if you follow politics , you have heard this one : liberals say @entity21 has to run for president because @entity23 is too cozy with @entity24			1
and now that @entity26 minority leader @entity25 is planning to retire -- creating an opening in the top @entity26 @entity29 job -- you are about to hear this : @entity16 has to run for leader because @entity32 is too cozy with @entity24			1
the senator from @entity34 is likely to give the same answer as she did on a presidential run , but @entity37 of @entity38 says the liberal clamoring tells us something about anxiety on the left			1
" what this does show is there is a lot of skepticism with the base with @entity32 , because he 's so close to @entity24 , and it 's an issue they 've really been hammering on , " @entity37 said			1
" so watch for more of that , because i have a feeling that they are going to make their voices heard , through @entity16 or not			1
a good week for @entity57			0
yes , you read that right			0
it has been a rocky year for @entity60 speaker @entity57 , but his allies think they may have just turned a corner			0
the @entity60 passed the @entity64 budget last week as well as a big @entity66 change known as the " doc fix " because it clarifies reimbursement rates to @entity66 providers			0
@entity72 's @entity71 shared reporting on how @entity73 hopes that ending the month with a little momentum will carry over when other big legislative battles come to the fore			1
" part of ( his success ) is because of the speaker 's willingness to use unconventional tactics , to work with democrat @entity83 for that @entity66 reform , " @entity71 said			2
" @entity2 has a lot of big deadlines when they return			0
so whether or not he can hold onto that power instead of seeing it slip will be really fascinating			0
@entity90 ? @entity91 ? watch the real estate listings ! @entity93 and sen. @entity94 both call @entity10 home			1
and both want to be the @entity64 nominee for president			0
they also happen to be on friendly terms			0
so among @entity10 republicans who love them both -- there is talk of a " dream ticket			0
" of course , it wo n't happen			0
rules and all that pertaining to the president and vice president coming from the same state			0
( @entity110 changed his residency from @entity112 to @entity113 right before joining the @entity115 ticket			0
) but @entity116 of the @entity117 said the obstacles are n't preventing @entity10 @entity64 from doing a little dreaming			0
" they say , look , @entity93 has all this executive experience , he 's bilingual , he has a @entity124 - @entity123 wife , " @entity116 said			2
he has an interest in foreign policy			0
why not ? " 4			0
@entity4 wants to " rock " the youth vote			1
much was made of the fact that @entity130 students had no choice but to attend the campus convocation at which @entity4 announced his bid for the @entity64 presidential nomination			1
but it gave @entity4 a big crowd -- and @entity137 of the @entity117 reports that @entity138 is determined to build a relationship with young conservatives such as those on hand for the announcement			1
" he 's playing at a lot of happy hours with young conservatives in the coming weeks and months , " @entity137 said			1
" and he really believes he can ignite those young conservatives , who are n't really familiar with @entity93 and are looking for someone new			2
is @entity5 waiting for a " summer wave " ? @entity5 had a well - regarded visit to @entity150 last week			1
and he got a decent buzz out of a @entity153 fund - raising stop , too			0
so is he ready to launch and join the crowded @entity64 2016 presidential field ? not so fast			2
two @entity150 republicans keeping close tabs on @entity64 visitors say he would n't give a firm answer about his intentions -- something they took as a hesitation to run			2
a national @entity64 source plugged into to the @entity5 operation says the governor has n't made a firm decision , and is talking about waiting until the summer to make a final call			1
that , too , is interpreted widely as a reluctance to run			2
this national source said @entity5 is one of two @entity64 governors who want to wait and see if those in the current field stumble after their official spring rollouts and create an opening for a " summer wave " of new entries			1
the other , according to this source , is @entity64 @entity180 gov. @entity179 .			2

can liberals " @entity16 " to run for @entity29 ' top @entity26 spot ?
@entity6 gov. @entity5 may wait until the summer to make a final call about 2016
sen. @entity4 's *strategy* is to try to " @entity188 " with young *people*
