@entity1 sen. @entity0 will announce monday that he is launching his campaign to become the 2016 @entity5 nominee for president			1
@entity0 has been positioning for this nomination almost since he entered the upper chamber in 2012			1
his announcement takes place at a bastion of conservatism , @entity13 , the institution founded by evangelical leader @entity15			0
@entity0 is going to run from the right			1
he has spent much of his short career in @entity18 blasting the " mushy middle " of his party ( which might be news to most @entity21 ) , which he dismisses as a " failed electoral strategy			0
" during a recent visit to @entity24 , where he vowed to eliminate the @entity25 and the @entity26 , @entity0 said that " i 'm pretty sure , here in @entity24 , y'all define gun control like we do in @entity1 : gun control is when you hit at what you aim at			1
" fifty years ago , another @entity5 senator ran this kind of campaign , @entity38 's @entity37 , who took on president @entity39			1
@entity0 will test the conventional wisdom that @entity37 's strategy was and remains a failure			1
when republicans voted to nominate him in 1964 , @entity37 told the delegates that " extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice			1
and moderation in the pursuit of justice no virtue			0
" when the icon of moderate @entity5 , @entity53 gov. @entity52 , spoke to the convention , the delegates hissed and booed			1
the outcome was far from great for the @entity5			1
@entity39 defeated @entity37 in a landslide election that brought in huge liberal @entity21 majorities that passed the exact programs that conservatives abhorred			2
although @entity37 was clearly wrong when he ran in 1964 , @entity0 thinks that the times have changed			1
is he right ? right now , the chances are not great			0
if @entity0 really sticks to this strategy of extremism , he faces very long odds of making it to the @entity68			2
the strategy might help him to garner some primary votes against @entity71 in red states , but it is not an approach with a great track record			0
even as the @entity5 has shifted to the right in recent decades , @entity5 candidates who have obtained the nomination , and those who have also won the presidency , always developed campaign themes that allowed them to appeal to broader coalitions than voters on the extremes			1
@entity86 had anti-communism and tax cuts to attract voters into one big tent , and @entity91 had a thousand points of light			2
his son @entity94 emphasized policies tied to " compassionate conservatism " to prove that he was not an extreme zealot			0
even republicans who did n't win in the general elections , like @entity100 and @entity101 , did not win the primary and caucus tallies by only playing to the base			0
notwithstanding the conventional wisdom , even in primaries it seems that @entity5 voters understand the importance of finding someone who has the potential to win in november			1
this coming election will be tough for @entity5			2
as all the experts have shown , the electoral college math does not favor the @entity5			2
some experts have predicted that @entity21 have over an 80 % chance of winning the @entity117			0
according to the @entity122 , if one looks at the states where the margin was narrow in the 2012 election , five currently favor @entity21 ( @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 ) while in others , like @entity129 , @entity21 have a very good chance of winning as a result of demographic trends , namely growing minority populations that favor their party 's nominee			2
barring any dramatic changes in the coming months , @entity21 will also have a very strong and seasoned nominee in @entity139			0
@entity0 is also not just someone who defends extremism but a politician who can easily be tied to the congressional obstructionism that has turned off so much of the electorate			2
the @entity5 has been dragged down by the kind of politics that voters have observed in @entity18			1
in 2014 , congressional approval ratings plummeted to 14 %			0
as the new year began , the approval ratings were only slightly better : just 16 %			0
this is the congressional @entity151 where @entity0 comes from			2
many voters who like conservatism and the @entity5 do n't love what their representatives are doing on @entity156			1
the kind of scorched earth , always say no to anything politics has not done well in terms of the favorability ratings			0
there have been few practitioners of this style of legislative politics as prominent as @entity0			2
during his campaign for the presidency , he might pay the price for the kind of politics that brought him great attention in @entity172			0
when @entity37 squared off against @entity39 in 1964 , the president predicted that there would be a " frontlash " of @entity5 and independent voters who would move way from the @entity5 just because @entity37 was at the top of the ticket			1
this was @entity39 's response to predictions of a backlash in the @entity184 from @entity21 who were angry about civil rights			0
the frontlash , @entity39 explained to @entity188 is " liberals , independents , moderate @entity5			0
" the electorate is not as likely to experience any dramatic swings like we saw in @entity195 states in 1964 , where solidly @entity5 areas went @entity21 because they were scared off by @entity37 , but a @entity0 campaign could be exactly what @entity21 need to cement victories in the swing states where the outcome is still uncertain			1
monday , @entity0 will bask in the spotlight of his announcement			0
but @entity5 are going to have to really think hard about whether they want to put all of their electoral eggs in this volatile basket which , at least based on the history , has a very slim chance of winning .			0

@entity211 : if @entity0 follows @entity37 's path , he and his party could lose big
contrary to conventional wisdom , @entity5 primary voters are more *interested* in victory than *ideology* , he says
