in 2011 , journalists flocked to @entity2 , the capital of the @entity3 , to cover the presidential election and the violence leading up to the vote			1
photographer @entity7 had different plans			1
" i could have focused on the election , but i chose to follow people around , " @entity7 said			1
" i wanted to experience what life in the country was like ... to understand another side of those events -- not those usually reported , but one that was much more personal			1
" it was @entity7 's burning personal quest that brings us " @entity21 , " a black - and - white series that helps us experience the @entity3 in flesh and blood			1
these rich portraitures and compositions of @entity7 's family members give us a vivid emotion of what it is like to be human as your country spirals into chaos			1
it is also a photographic detour from the cliche images of the @entity3 -- a subtler but deeply psychological representation of how war affects daily lives			1
war is something only experienced marginally by @entity7 , who was born and raised in @entity42 to a @entity42 mother and a @entity3 father			1
stories of the @entity3 were narratives whispered into his @entity48 upbringing			1
" i had never been , " to @entity3 , he said			2
" it was a latent desire i had for a very long time to go there			0
i do n't feel particularly drawn to @entity42 ... but going ( to @entity3 ) made me feel even more lost			2
" connecting with his family in the @entity3 , the photographer attended baptisms and weddings , exorcisms and political rallies			1
everywhere he looked , he felt a challenge to his core beliefs as he went down his dna chain			0
" i felt very challenged in my identity , sometimes as a ' white , ' others as a ' black ' person , " @entity7 said			2
" this led to many conflicts , internal and external ; many arguments ; and it also directed the way i photographed			0
" while feeling the warm welcome of his family , @entity7 still felt a certain reticence when they looked at the camera			2
their trust was not always unshakable , and that state of awareness become synonymous with the @entity3			2
social media follow @ @entity80 on @entity81 to join the conversation about photography			0
he uses a photo of a family reunion -- the first in the gallery above -- as an example			0
" i find that photo a little disturbing , because all the gazes are going into different directions , " @entity7 said			2
" there are clearly some mixed emotions here			0
and that is the @entity3			2
it is a very complex country , and it is not always easy to read which signs are being communicated			0
there is a state of tension and confusion			0
" working with the approach of an artisan , @entity7 plays with light to create a certain magic in the aura of the people he portrays			0
it is a useful tool in a place with so many contrasts			0
" i like to remain loyal to the principles of film development and darkrooms , " said @entity7 , who shot " @entity21 " on a digital camera			0
" the light is a combination of using flashes and taking advantage of the amazing presence of the sun. the humid atmosphere , fog and dust renders some interesting possibilities ... like a natural filter			0
" @entity7 went back in 2013 and said his journey through the country is not over yet			1
" i think i reached my objective , to embed into the daily life in the @entity3 , which clearly transformed me , " he said			1
" i was allowed into the life of people who were former strangers ... and got a deeper understanding of what daily life in the @entity3 could feel like			1
" i was also deeply impressed to discover how much life there is in this country , how much more there is to discover , how complex it is to understand , and how much work that will require			0
