three decades ago , @entity0 took arguably the most iconic picture of all time			1
yet even after all this time , the pre-eminent photographer brims with enthusiasm when he talks about " @entity6			1
" " i knew she had an incredible look , a penetrating gaze , " he recalls			2
" but there was a crowd of people around us , the dust was swirling around , and it was before digital cameras and you never knew what would happen with the film			2
" when i developed the picture , i knew it was special			2
i showed it to the editor of the @entity24 , and he leaped to his feet and shouted , ' that 's our next cover '			1
" not only did " @entity6 " become the magazine 's next cover , but the most successful in its distinguished history			1
the striking portrait of 12 - year - old @entity6 , a @entity32 orphan in the @entity34 refugee camp on the @entity37 - @entity36 border , was taken in december 1984 and published the following year			1
the woman , now in her forties , has recently been found to be living in @entity36			2
when @entity0 reflects upon its popularity , what excites him most is the impact that this single image has had on the real world			1
" people volunteered to work in the refugee camps because of that photograph , " he says			1
" @entity37 are incredibly proud of it , as the girl is poor but shows great pride , fortitude and self - respect			1
" it drew attention to their plight , and inspired a lot of people			2
" it also led the @entity24 to set up the @entity62 -- and meant that to this day , @entity0 is never charged a fare by appreciative @entity37 taxi drivers			1
the portrait forms the centerpiece of a major retrospective exhibition of @entity0 's work , which opened recently in @entity69 , @entity70 , and will run until 6 april			1
" it 's great to look back on my work and see how themes and connections have emerged			1
but i am never even remotely thinking of retiring , " the 64 - year - old tells @entity1 from his studio in @entity78			1
" there are so many new places and stories that fascinate me			2
i have a long list of places to visit : @entity86 , @entity85 , @entity87 , @entity88			2
" i believe that when you find something you love , you should do it your whole life			2
why would you retire from doing what you love ? it 's just not what we do			1
" the famous photograph is just one of thousands of extraordinary pictures that @entity0 has taken over a 40 - year career , during which he has won dozens of awards			1
one which is displayed prominently in his retrospective exhibition was taken in @entity105 in 1991 , during the first @entity106			1
it shows three camels silhouetted against an explosion of fire and smoke			2
" @entity113 had blown up 600 oil wells , " he recalls			2
" it was an environmental catastrophe			2
lakes of oil were leaking all over the country , and seeping into the @entity119			2
" half of it was on fire			2
there were geysers of oil spurting out of the earth , making it like midnight during the day			2
" he spotted the camels running along the edge of an oilfield , and followed them in his jeep			0
but they had been blackened by the oil , and there was no way to capture a picture of them against the black cloud behind			0
" suddenly they ran in front of a burning area , and they were illuminated by fire , " he says			0
" i took the shot , and then realized i had driven into a minefield			0
" i had to carefully back out , following the tire tracks i had made on the way in to avoid getting blown up			0
" for many years , frontline war photography like this was @entity0 's stock in trade			1
indeed , it enabled him to make his name			0
born in @entity157 in 1950 , @entity0 -- whose right hand was permanently damaged when he fell down some stairs at the age of five -- studied theater arts at @entity161			1
two years after graduating , he moved to @entity162 in search of a freelance photography career			1
his big break came in the late 1970s , when he disguised himself in @entity37 clothes and crossed illegally into @entity37 , just before the @entity168 invasion			0
there he took a set of searing photographs of people who were being attacked by their own government			1
" as soon as i crossed the border , i came across about 40 houses and a few schools that were just bombed out , " he says			1
" they were literally destroying whole villages with helicopter gunships			0
" this was a profound situation that really needed to be told , and few people could get access to it because it was too remote			0
" i got completely caught up in the story			0
that 's when i knew that this was what i did -- this was me			1
" against a background of the @entity191 , the @entity88 backed the @entity37 army and @entity193 supported the @entity194			0
the lens of the @entity197 media quickly swung towards the region , and @entity0 happened to be already embedded			1
his pictures were soon appearing in the @entity200 , time and @entity202 -- but not before @entity0 had escaped from @entity37 by crossing the tribal areas on foot , with his precious film sewn into his clothing			1
this was the beginning of many years of war photography , which he now describes as " the gritty period " of his career			1
he covered the @entity211 , the @entity119 wars and several conflicts in @entity37 , as well as those further afield in @entity215 , @entity216 and the @entity217			0
" when you 're working in a war zone , you 're living moment to moment with people trying to kill you , " he says			1
" there are so many ways i could have been killed , with guns , bombs and shrapnel			0
you live with fear you could cut with a knife			0
" several times i was held up at gunpoint			0
my camera and money have been robbed , people have broken into my hotel room while i was sleeping			0
" many times i thought that i had pushed things too far , that it was not a good idea to enter this skirmish or battle			0
many times i have thought that this is n't going to end well			0
" but i have found that i get completely consumed by the importance of the story i am telling , the feeling that the world has got to know			1
it 's never about the adrenaline			1
it 's about the story			1
" has frontline reporting become more dangerous ? " it has always been dangerous , but now there is the added dimension of trying to grab headlines , " he says			0
" you might have got kidnapped or shot in the past , but not beheaded			0
there was no wish to create a heinous piece of theater			0
" but we ca n't give in			0
these stories have to be reported , and writers and photographers have to continue telling them			0
" @entity0 's portfolio is far broader than his war photography , however			1
he has worked all over the world , from the jungles of @entity266 to the mountains of @entity268 , each time seeming to capture the soul of the people he photographs			1
" my camera acts as a shield when i 'm photographing something horrific , as it 's easier to look at distressing sights through a viewfinder , " he says			2
" but when i 'm not in a war zone , having a camera helps me talk to people , interact , and get involved			2
" to take a good picture , you need to spend time with people until they trust you and forget that you 're there to photograph them			0
" i try to make eye contact when i take a portrait , as it seems to allow you to understand the person , to see their story written on their face			0
" the advent of the digital camera , he says , has made his job easier			0
" i 'm not one of those photographers that hankers after the good old days , " he says			0
" digital photography is better than film ever was			0
" although everybody is taking pictures with camera phones , he says , this is " just noise " , and does n't " dilute the value " of a truly great photograph that will endure and be memorable			0
" " there has to be an emotional component to the picture that you connect with on a profound level , " he says			0
" once you see it , you ca n't forget it , and it is so compelling and powerful that it becomes part of the cultural landscape			0
" like " @entity6 " ? he pauses			1
" yes , like that			0
" @entity0 - @entity322 lo @entity321 runs until april 6 , 2015 at @entity69 .			1
