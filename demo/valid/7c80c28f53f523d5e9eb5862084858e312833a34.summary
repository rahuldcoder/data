fortunately , the intensive diplomatic efforts to prevent a nuclear - armed @entity1 and another war did n't stop after 47 @entity4 senators , led by freshman sen. @entity5 , appeared to try to goad @entity1 's leaders into forgoing a diplomatic solution to the nuclear dispute			1
neither have they stopped since @entity12 prime minister @entity11 delivered what was effectively a reelection campaign speech on the @entity16 floor			2
despite so many concerted efforts to sabotage our diplomats , our negotiators are still hard at work to secure an agreement with @entity23 that , if successfully concluded , will go down in the annals of diplomatic history as marking a new era for @entity28 - @entity1 relations			2
indeed , progress toward a political framework would move us closer to attainable safeguards on @entity1 's nuclear program as well as jump - start a more productive relationship that could pay extra dividends for years to come			1
before president @entity37 's phone call with @entity1 president @entity38 last fall -- the first direct contact between @entity28 and @entity1 heads of state in more than 30 years -- such an agreement seemed unthinkable			1
now , with clear - eyed diplomacy , negotiators from the @entity28 and five other countries , plus @entity1 , are in reach of delivering a peaceful resolution to the decade - long impasse over @entity1 's nuclear program			1
diplomats have tackled thorny , complex nonproliferation issues that have never been comprehensively addressed in a multilateral agreement before			0
they have labored to eliminate @entity1 's potential pathways to a nuclear weapon while allowing the country to maintain a limited nuclear energy program , but under what is arguably the world 's most locked - down nuclear inspections regime			1
@entity28 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 negotiators are continuing to build on the solid success of the preliminary nuclear accord negotiated last year , the so - called @entity64			0
that plan continues to grant inspectors daily access to @entity1 's nuclear facilities in order to verify its adherence to the agreement			1
as a result , @entity1 's nuclear program will be frozen for the first time since its inception , as diplomats craft a comprehensive resolution to this standoff			1
if and when a final agreement is reached , the president may temporarily waive some sanctions if @entity1 's compliance can be verified			1
@entity82 has , for its part , authorized the president to provide limited , temporary and reversible sanctions relief so long as doing so advances @entity28 national security interests			0
as former national security adviser @entity89 and countless other national security experts have attested , such a diplomatic solution to this crisis is squarely in the national interests of the @entity28			0
in exchange for @entity1 following through on its promises to constrain its program in accordance with the agreement , the @entity82 will be asked to lift sanctions permanently			2
if @entity23 demonstrates its long - term commitment to limit its nuclear program to exclusively peaceful purposes , then when the time comes , @entity82 should be ready to lift the sanctions			0
in the interim , it is crucial that all parties scrupulously adhere to the terms of this landmark agreement			0
while @entity1 must not install unauthorized centrifuges , attempt a secret program or otherwise fail to adhere to the agreement , the @entity82 also has responsibilities under the agreement , including appropriations for its execution and refraining from imposing new sanctions in violation of either the letter or the spirit of the deal			2
all this suggests that to jeopardize such progress at this critical stage would be reckless , if not foolhardy			1
of course , history suggests that we should be cautious			0
and the stakes are indeed extremely high			0
but the last thing the world needs is another major war in the @entity128			0
members of @entity82 should therefore join the preeminent statesmen , military officers and the overwhelming majority of the @entity28 public in welcoming what is poised to be a diplomatic success -- one that could protect @entity28 security and prevent further instability in the @entity128 that would result from a nuclear @entity1			2
we should ensure that our diplomats have the support they need to reach the finish line and that our president is able to cross it .			0
