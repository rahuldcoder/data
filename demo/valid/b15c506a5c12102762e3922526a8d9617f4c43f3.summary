" lawyer and prominent feminist @entity194 called the filmmaker " irresponsible			0
" " creating public space for them , encouraging tolerance of any form of violence , what the film will do , it will project justifications for rape -- which i think is completely wrong			2
it 's going on public view where young people will be seeing it , there 's no guarantee these convicts wo n't be seen as natural role models for most			0
" many questioned how @entity132 was able to obtain 16 hours of interviews with the imprisoned @entity38			0

" my main problem , how can we screen this documentary when there 's an appeals process underway ? " @entity255 suggested that the documentary 's title , " @entity1 's daughter , " inferred that @entity1 were badly in need of a rescue mission , leaving the impression of a " white savior " complex			1
" @entity1 's daughter " is directed by @entity132 , a @entity15 woman who spent two years on the project			2
she said she was inspired by the mass protests that followed the gang rape case in @entity115			0
among the voices in the debate , some were critical of what they perceived as @entity272 bias that depicts @entity1 as a place of misogyny when rape and sexual assaults are universal			1
" i have tried to convey that while we in @entity1 are in fact engaged in confronting the violence and discrimination against women here , it does not help for people in other countries to imagine that such brutality is @entity1 's ' cultural ' problem ; that @entity1 's ' backwardness ' is the problem ; or that gender violence is ' worse out there in @entity1 , ' " @entity255 wrote			2
