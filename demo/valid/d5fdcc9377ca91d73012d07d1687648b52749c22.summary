when man relies on machine , there is always something that can go wrong			0
and there is no more unforgiving environment than the high - stakes world of @entity8			2
" @entity14 is one of those ... probably a crueler sport in that there 's so many other variables , " says @entity11 's @entity10 driver @entity9 , ahead of sunday 's season - opening @entity13 @entity12			1
" unfortunately it 's not like tennis where all the racquets are pretty much the same and you ca n't blame anyone but yourself			0
" @entity9 experienced the full extent of @entity8 's cruelty at last year 's @entity29 race			1
the @entity13 crossed the line in second place -- seemingly becoming the first @entity13 to finish on the podium at @entity33 -- but jubilation soon turned to despair			0
he was disqualified hours after the race when officials ruled his car had exceeded the maximum fuel flow rate , a rule which states each car is limited to 100 kilograms of fuel per race and was introduced to make the sport more fuel efficient			0
" it 's frustrating , i mean it 's a part of the sport which will always be frustrating , " said the 25 - year - old , reflecting on what was his @entity11 debut			1
" i 'm sure even @entity56 ( @entity57 ) and @entity58 ( @entity59 ) last year were frustrated at the times because you never have the perfect car , " he added , referring to the two @entity54 drivers , who finished first and second last season			0
" but it is what it is , i signed up for that a long time ago , and you just learn to accept it			0
" it 's a sport where even driving ability often fails to overcome mechanical failures -- eventual world champion @entity57 was forced to retire from last year 's race at @entity33			2
but technical blunders do n't always end in disaster -- @entity57 won the @entity76 @entity12 after experiencing mechanical faults early in the race , and @entity80 driver @entity79 lost a wheel in 2014 's opener before roaring to a fifth - place finish			1
despite @entity9 's previous disappointment , he 's ca n't wait to race on his home turf again next sunday			1
" i definitely feel privileged to have a home race ... it just increases all the hype and all the excitement " said @entity9 , adding that he would use " all the @entity13 flags and all the cheers to my advantage			2
" after last year 's disaster @entity9 is looking to make things right , " there 's a little bit of redemption , i 'm confident we can get it back			1

@entity11 's @entity10 driver @entity9 says @entity8 is a " crueler sport "
last year @entity9 was disqualified from the @entity13 @entity12 after finishing second
the 25 - year - old is looking for redemption in @entity29 on sunday
