ever since the superstar songstress released her surprise self - titled album in december 2013 , it seems like dropping music with little to no fanfare has become a thing			1
the latest artist to do so is rapper @entity10 , whose eagerly awaited sophomore album was set for release march 23			1
instead , " to pimp a butterfly " was made available on @entity13 and @entity14 early monday			2
@entity10 , who has been hailed as the savior of hip - hop , got a major shout - out from fellow artist @entity19			0
among the other artists who 've surprised fans : drake the rapper thrilled fans in february when he snuck out " if you 're @entity25			2
" like @entity2 , he clued fans in via an @entity27 post			0
the 17 - track project was billed as a mixtape			0
the rapper also released a short film titled " @entity32			2
" @entity33 the shock in the band 's album " @entity37 " was not only that it was released but that @entity13 subscribers had no choice but to get it			1
@entity40 made the album part of an automatic download in october as part of the @entity45 announcement			0
@entity33 frontman @entity46 later apologized , and @entity40 distributed info to customers on how they could delete the album after some complained that the automatic download was invasive			0
@entity52 in 2013 , the legendary rocker unexpectedly released " @entity54			1

@entity59 the @entity61 trio received much less attention than some others when they dropped " @entity67 " in march 2014 with no promotion or marketing			0
@entity68 the rapper 's " @entity69 : the journey to @entity76 " arrived online in march 2014 and led @entity71 to ask , " is the @entity2 approach working for other ' surprise ' albums ? " " i wonder when this is done frequently , does the surprise factor wane ? " one executive told @entity71			1
