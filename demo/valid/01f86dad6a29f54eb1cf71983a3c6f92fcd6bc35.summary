@entity10 @entity1 's money machine expectations , @entity4 's @entity3 trip , @entity7 's @entity6 strategy and @entity9 's next move were all topics around the " @entity14 " table this sunday			1
@entity1 is going to be doubling down on his contrast with @entity16 on transparency , using the emails he released from his time as governor of @entity21 -- and maybe the @entity23 's largest e-retailer			1
while @entity1 has already released the first chapter of his e-book on his website , @entity24 of the @entity25 reports that @entity1 is in serious negotiations with @entity30 for a big deal that would have the full memoir published across all its platforms , including @entity34			1
" he 'll use the emails to draw a narrative of his time in @entity21 -- the highs , the lows , but also some mistakes , some errors , " said @entity24			0
many recent presidential candidates have written books before or during their runs for the @entity44 , but all have to prove themselves in the race for campaign cash			0
one of the big early tests for presidential candidates is to prove they can raise the money for the long haul			1
and the first lap in the money primary winds up at the end of this month , when candidates have to report their first - quarter fund - raising totals			1
@entity11 's @entity59 reveals that there is a bit of an expectations game clash underway as we head into the final weeks of the quarter			1
@entity65 got a bit dismayed when several allies started talking about a record - smashing $ 100 million quarter for his " right to rise " political action committee			0
now , some @entity1 allies are bragging that a $ 50 million figure would still be a big deal			1
are they trying to truly lower expectations -- or just create space for a bigger number to be a bigger deal ? we 'll know in three weeks			2
after @entity16 's email controversy , there 's been a lot of talk about who would step in if she bowed out as a potential @entity85 presidential candidate			2
one high - profile politician who 's planning his first trip to @entity3 in over a decade has a lot of @entity89 buzzing , according to @entity11 's @entity90			1
" ( former vice president @entity4 ) says he 's not running			1
i 'm sure he 's not , but he 's doing a climate leadership workshop that 's getting everyone there sort of excited , " said @entity90			2
" by then , @entity16 will probably already be in the race , but @entity89 in @entity3 who are hungry for a different type of politics might be signing up for these workshops may 5 through the 7th in @entity99			1
" as the deadline nears for a nuclear policy agreement between @entity6 and six world powers including the @entity23 , all eyes will be on sen. @entity7			0
@entity7 has been trying to shore up his foreign policy credentials to satisfy the more hawkish elements in the @entity106 , but @entity110 's @entity109 questions whether his attempts are working			2
" this past week he signed on as a co-sponsor to legislation giving @entity113 final say over any deal that 's struck by the administration , " said @entity109			2
" it 's unlikely to be enough to satisfy parts of the @entity106 base and also satisfy key donors for the party who are very concerned about @entity123			0
" " he also came under fire this past week for not applauding vociferously enough during @entity123 prime minister @entity126 's speech			0
i think a lot of eyes will be on him this month as we delve into these issues			0
" as @entity113 ' slugfest over @entity136 funding ends , @entity133 's @entity132 looks ahead to more tough fights for @entity44 speaker @entity9 , including appropriations battles and the fall 's debt ceiling fight			0
one of the keys to the outcome of these future clashes is @entity9 's plan to handle the @entity44 @entity106 's contentious tea party members			0
" is @entity9 willing to continually antagonize the far right wing of his party and pass legislation with @entity89 ? or will he be passing bills with only @entity106 ? " asks @entity132			0
" and that , i think , will tell us a lot about what the @entity113 will look like in the next few years to come			0

the @entity1 money machine faces the expectations game
