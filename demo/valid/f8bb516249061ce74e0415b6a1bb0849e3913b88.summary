@entity0 , @entity1 do not generalize @entity1 as a country of rapists			1
that was the firm message from the @entity7 ambassador in @entity0 after a professor back home was accused of turning down a male @entity1 student 's application for an internship due to the @entity15 nation 's " rape problem			1
" professor @entity16 never did such a thing , according to her and the @entity18			0
the university points out four of her 30 students and two of her laboratory interns come from @entity1 ; while it was n't clear how many of them were men , the university said 29 of its 44 @entity1 students total are male			1
still , @entity16 has admitted making a mistake by engaging the rejected intern candidate with talk about rape in @entity1 society and how the issue spurred " many ( other ) female professors in @entity7 ( have ) decided to no longer accept male @entity1 students for these reasons			1
" " it was never my intention to make a defamatory comment about @entity1 society , " she said , according to a statement posted on the website of the @entity18			1
" i do not have anything against @entity1 students -- on the contrary			2
i sincerely apologize to anyone whose feelings i may have hurt			2
" marital rape : why is it legal in @entity1 ? the firestorm began with a recent post on the social - networking site @entity52			1
it featured what appeared to be screenshots of email excerpts involving someone in the @entity18 's biochemistry department			0
they fell under this provocative headline : " what should an @entity1 male student do if he is denied an internship opportunity on the basis of @entity1 being projected as an unsafe country for women ? " the post did n't identify @entity16 , blacking out the name of the emails ' author			1
but it did lead with this statement that was later linked to her : " unfortunately i do n't accept any @entity1 male students for internships			2
we hear a lot about the rape problem in @entity1 which i can not support			1
i have many female students in the group , so i think this attitude is something i can not support			0
" the thing is , @entity16 says she " never wrote " such a message , claiming this email was " put together from individual segments taken from different mails			0
" " i do not reject students because of reasons of race or gender , " she added			0
" i am by no means racist or xenophobic in any way			0
" here 's what the @entity18 says did happen : the professor told the candidate " the laboratories are fully occupied			2
" the @entity1 applicant " did n't accept " this rejection , the university says , and went back - and - forth with @entity100 over email			0
during that exchange , @entity16 wrote things that she later regretted -- excerpts of which were posted to @entity52 and the university acknowledged as legitimate			0
speaking about how @entity1 men might be stereotyped due to reports about alarming instances of rape in their native country , she said , " i fully agree that this is a generalization and may not apply to individuals			1
however it is also unbelievable that the @entity1 society is not able to solve this problem for many years now			1
" @entity1 bans rape documentary @entity16 referred to regular reports of " multi-rape crimes " and abuse of female tourists that , " for me ... demonstrate the attitude of society towards ( women )			1
" such incidents have moved other female professors to reject male @entity1 " and currently other @entity128 female associations are joining			0
" " of course we can not change or influence the @entity1 society , " she added , " but only take our consequences here in @entity128			1
" the idea that the professor would n't accept male @entity1 for internships -- as reported by @entity52 and denied by the @entity18 -- riled up some in @entity1 , a number of whom wrote on the @entity52 thread			1
one user , identified as @entity137 , said , " do n't leave this issue			0
it is a serious fault to generalize people on such grounds			0
" another user , posting as @entity149 , wrote , " i do n't wan na come to an era where i should say ' @entity146 ( sic ) , i 'm from @entity1 , i 'm not a rapist			0
" one person echoing that view publicly is @entity152 , @entity7 's ambassador to @entity1			1
" your oversimplifying and discriminating generalization is an offense to these women and men ardently committed to furthering women empowerment in @entity1 ; and it is an offense to millions of law - abiding , tolerant , open - minded and hard - working @entity1 , " @entity153 wrote monday in a letter posted on the embassy website			0
" let 's be clear : @entity1 is not a country of rapists			2
" the ambassador urged @entity16 " to learn more about the diverse , dynamic and fascinating country and the many welcoming and open - minded people of @entity1 so that you could correct a simplistic image , which — in my opinion — is particularly unsuitable for a professor and teacher			2
" @entity2 's @entity175 and journalist @entity176 reported from @entity1 , and @entity2 's @entity177 wrote this story from @entity179			2
@entity2 's @entity180 contributed to this report .			0
