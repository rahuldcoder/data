@entity1 " go back home ! " " locusts ! you 're not welcome here ! " these were just some of the insults hurled at @entity8 shoppers sunday as hundreds of @entity9 surged through through the old neighborhood of @entity11 , an area close to the city 's border with @entity8			1
it was the latest in a series of angry protests that have seen brawls erupt in humdrum shopping malls , with demonstrators singling out the " parallel traders " who crowd into @entity1 to purchase tax - free products and then resell them for a profit back in @entity8			1
" i 've grown up here , and ever since a lot of the @entity8 started coming into @entity1 , things have changed , " said @entity24 , a law student who only gave her surname			1
clad in a mask to protect against police wielding pepper spray , she took part in the protest with her mother			0
local residents say the traders are not only disturbing the peace , but are driving up the price of food , rent , and gutting local neighborhoods of their character - the city has become a blur of jewelers , pharmacies and other businesses that cater primarily to @entity8 shoppers			1
" previously there were a lot of indigenous places like restaurants , but all of them have closed , " said @entity24 , standing across from a store selling baby milk powder - the top item on many @entity8 tourists ' shopping lists			2
" it 's very difficult to be very welcoming			0
" tensions have long been simmering between @entity1 and the motherland , and parallel trading is just one of the thorny issues brought about by the influx of mainland @entity8 to the city			1
a series of food scandals -- most notably in 2008 when melamine - tainted milk powder caused infant deaths across @entity8 -- led to shortages of baby milk formula in @entity1 as @entity8 flocked to buy up the city 's supplies			1
the ensuing uproar led the government to introduce a law limiting the purchase to two tins per traveler leaving the city			0
last year , 31 million @entity8 visitors traveled to @entity1 , accounting for 78 % of all tourists , according to the government			1
but the numbers hide that the visitors are n't all sightseeing tourists in the traditional sense			0
there are the day - trippers , wheeling suitcases and carting boxes of goods and supplies across the border , but there is also an increasing number of wealthy mainland @entity8 who are buying up luxury properties , and visit the city on a regular basis			1
according to the @entity104 , developers say as much as 40 % of new home buyers are from @entity8			2
residents blame them for causing a hike in real estate prices in what reports say is already the most expensive property market in the world			2
both the @entity8 and @entity1 government have encouraged mainland tourists to visit the city and boost the local economy			1
relaxed restrictions have made it easy for @entity8 residents to get a hold of individual multiple - entry permits -- some mainlanders enter hundreds of times a year on a single pass			1
this has infuriated protestors , particularly the younger generation , who want the government to scrap the permits			0
in a speech last tuesday , the city 's @entity130 leader @entity129 announced that his government would examine restricting mainland visitors , acknowledging the pressure the crowds have had on the everyday lives of @entity1 residents			1
but the permit controversy is just one symptom of a deeper conflict			0
when it comes down to it , it 's simple : many @entity9 just do n't feel very @entity8			2
according to a recent survey by the @entity146 , the number of @entity1 residents identifying primarily as " @entity8 " has dipped to an all - time low since the former @entity150 colony was returned to @entity8 control in 1997			1
the majority of respondents said they were " @entity9 first , and also @entity8			2
" earlier in 2012 , plans to add @entity8 civic education into the @entity1 public school curriculum caused an uproar , resulting in a city - wide protest with locals claiming it would " brainwash " school children with pro-mainland propaganda			1
@entity1 , ruled under @entity8 's principle of " one country , two systems , " means the city is a officially part of @entity8 , but is allowed rights and freedoms unseen in other @entity8 cities			1
but there 's one key privilege @entity173 has refused to grant to @entity1 : free and open elections for their own leader			2
frustrated @entity9 have tried everything to demand greater voting rights , from hunger strikes to massive street occupations , with no luck			0
that 's why people in @entity1 feel an increasing sense of resentment and helplessness when it comes to solving the complex , growing rift between their city and mainland @entity8			1
a small but growing minority of disgruntled activists go as far as to say @entity1 should not belong to @entity8 at all			1
" we @entity1 people have our own culture , we have our own currency , we have all the requirements to build a country			2
" said @entity198 , a member of a radical @entity199			0
" for decades we have been fighting against civic rights , democracy			0
however , no matter how much we have been working , it 's like we 're begging for something that will never happen			0
" many mainland @entity8 are bewildered by the anger directed at them			1
" it 's normal for people to spend money and shop here , why are they protesting ? " said a @entity8 tourist waiting at a bus stop to get away from the angry crowds			0
she said her suitcase was loaded with make - up and clothing that is much cheaper to buy in @entity1 than across the border in her hometown of @entity219			0
" there 's definitely an element of discrimination against mainlanders here			0
i 'm not saying everyone is like that in @entity1 , but there are certain people who are very prejudiced , " she added			0
another @entity8 resident who makes weekly visits to relatives in the city was sitting on a curb away from the ruckus			2
she said her friends have considered boycotting @entity1 altogether			0
" my friends on @entity238 say , do n't come to @entity1 , let 's burn our travel permits , " she said as she thumbed through the receipts of her latest purchases			0
" we should all just be more considerate and tolerant of each other , we 're just here to shop			0
let 's just be happy , " she said .			0
