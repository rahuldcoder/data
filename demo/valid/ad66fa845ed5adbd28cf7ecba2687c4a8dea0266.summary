@entity1 forces say they 've captured key areas in their offensive to take back @entity5 , which has been under @entity7 control since june			1
the security forces , backed by @entity10 militias , raised the @entity1 flag over the governorate and the main hospital buildings in the city monday night , a security official with the forces in @entity5 told @entity2			1
the gains , according to the official , came after a slow advance into the city as the forces dealt with more than 300 improvised explosive devices planted in the city 's streets			0
at least 26 militants were killed in the operation , the official said			0
earlier monday , @entity1 federal police said in a statement aired on @entity1 television that the forces had liberated four neighborhoods in southern @entity5			2
the renewed push into @entity5 comes days after a series of @entity36 - led airstrikes aimed at @entity7 targets around the city			1
the goal of those airstrikes was to pave the way for @entity1 forces to go in			0
now security forces and fighters from @entity44 , a predominantly @entity10 paramilitary force that has doing much of the fighting in the critical battle to take @entity5 back from @entity7 , say they 're gaining ground			1
@entity1 forces have tried multiple times to win back @entity5 since @entity7 , which calls itself the @entity49 , conquered the city in june as part of its campaign to amass an expansive @entity54 caliphate			1
and each time , so far , they 've failed			0
the latest push began after @entity1 prime minister @entity56 on march 1 ordered @entity1 forces to retake @entity5 and @entity58 province			1
militants have been under pressure ever since in the battleground city , which is the birthplace of former @entity1 dictator @entity62 and located about 160 kilometers ( 100 miles ) north of @entity63			0
@entity7 responded by adjusting its positions in and around the city , hiding in buildings and other key infrastructure , said @entity68 , a spokesman for @entity56			0
this movement led @entity1 's military to pause its operation , out of growing worries that a full - on invasion could produce heavy @entity1 military and some civilian casualties			2
the situation spurred the @entity1 prime minister to request help from the @entity36 - led coalition , which conducted airstrikes around @entity5 last week			2
@entity2 's @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 contributed to this report .			0
