sen. @entity0 , @entity2 , made news this week when he told @entity1 's @entity4 that he would get his health care through @entity6			1
previously , @entity0 's family was covered under his wife 's policy through her employer , the investment bank @entity11			1
but with her husband 's presidential candidacy underway , @entity12 has taken a leave without pay			1
so she has lost her @entity11 health benefits			1
the story went viral , in part because @entity0 once engineered a partial government shutdown to try to kill @entity6			1
as part of his crusade , @entity0 conducted a 21 - hour talkathon on the @entity25 floor , during which he read dr. @entity27 ' classic " @entity28			1
" spoiler alert : " @entity28 " ends with the protagonist actually trying the food he thought he hated -- and liking it			1
now that @entity0 is likely to try @entity6 , my guess is he will have a similar experience			1
so , with apologies to dr. @entity27 -- who would no doubt have found a way to rhyme " president bar " with " @entity6 " -- here is my updated version of " @entity28			1
" president @entity41 do not likethat president bar do you likeobamacare ? i do not like it , president @entity45 do not @entity44			1

but if your wife leaves @entity11 , and you do n't want to pay the tax , try it ! try it ! you may seeobamacare is good for me			0

@entity146 notes ( in verse ) @entity0 's *apparent* change of heart on @entity6 , which he *slammed* but has now signed up for
he says @entity0 's politics will demand he continue to *advocate* for *law* 's *repeal* despite benefits he receives from its coverage
