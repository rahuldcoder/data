an officer , responding to reports of a suspicious person , shot and killed an unarmed man who was running around in a metro @entity5 apartment complex naked			1
the officer fired two shots when the man charged at him , said @entity9 , the public safety director of @entity11			1
but given that the man was not carrying a weapon , the police department immediately turned over the case to the @entity16 for an independent probe			1
" what i have requested here [ is ] a result of what 's going on currently across this country as it relates to police shootings , " @entity9 told reporters			1
the officer was white ; the deceased man was @entity28 , @entity9 said			1
the incident took place monday afternoon at an apartment complex in @entity32 , a suburb of @entity5			0
someone called 911 to report a man " acting deranged , knocking on doors and crawling around naked , " @entity9 said			1
when the officer arrived , the man charged at him , @entity9 said			1
" the officer called him to stop while stepping backward , drew his weapon and fired two shots , " he said			1
the man , struck twice in the upper body , died			2
police later learned he was a resident at the complex			2
" i can only reasonably assume that if he was running around the apartment complex naked , i believe we can make the assumption there may have been some mental health experience that he might have been having , " @entity9 said			0
@entity11 police officers undergo some degree of training on how to deal with the mentally ill. but this , and other incidents , highlight the need for more , the public safety director said			2
" that 's becoming more and more apparent , " @entity9 said			0
" we have already , as many departments have begun to do , look at how to expand our mental health training when we find it certainly necessary to do so			0
because it appears that we 're seeing more and more of these cases across the country in which police are engaging with those who appear to be in distress			2
" police did not release the officer 's name , but said the seven - year veteran was placed on administrative leave			1
during the incident , the officer had access to his stun gun and pepper spray , @entity9 said			2
why he chose to draw his weapon will come out during the investigation			0
" i think in all fairness we need to wait and see what the outcome of the investigation is because i ca n't tell you , beyond what i have told you so far , what kind of measures that officer may have taken , " he said			0
as fatal police shootings come under increased scrutiny in the current climate , police departments also appear to be more forthcoming in proactively releasing information for transparency 's sake			0
such is the case in @entity101 , @entity102 , where @entity101 police chief @entity103 has been out front and outspoken about the shooting death of 19 - year - old @entity106 at the hands of an officer			1
and it seems to be the case in this @entity11 incident			0
" if you look at the state in this country and the things we 're going through right now across this country with police - involved shooting , certainly it 's a concern to many @entity121			0
and there has certainly been recommendations that have been made in regards to moving towards more independent type of investigations , " he said .			0
