@entity1 prime minister @entity0 coasted to victory in tuesday 's elections , defying pre-election polls showing his @entity7 party trailing his main rival , the center - left @entity9			1
ever the master politician and brilliant tactician , he used the politics of fear to galvanize his right - wing base , which ultimately secured him a fourth term			0
@entity1 , however , may not fare as well as its leader did at the polls			2
in a matter of days , @entity0 exposed his true attitude toward @entity1 's conflict with the @entity21 , in the process threatening to further erode an already strained relationship with the @entity24			1
less than two weeks ago , @entity0 declared that his speech of june 2009 at @entity26 , where he publicly endorsed a demilitarized @entity21 state , is no longer relevant			2
on monday , he continued on this theme , announcing that a @entity21 state would not be established under his watch			0
these comments were tactical moves aimed at mobilizing his base , but so was his @entity26 speech a maneuver aimed at appeasing @entity37 president @entity36 and quelling criticism from abroad			0
ultimately , political expedience led @entity0 to reveal what many critics had long suspected : he has never supported a two - state solution			0
in the last six years of his premiership , @entity0 has spoken out repeatedly against a withdrawal to the 1967 borders , with mutually agreed land swaps -- the basis for a two - state solution ; insisted that @entity21 recognize @entity1 as the state of the @entity51 people -- a condition no @entity21 leader can accept ; and presided over unprecedented settlement activity in the @entity55 and @entity56 , which the @entity21 regard as their future capital			1
meanwhile , the @entity1 prime minister has disparaged @entity60 president @entity59 at every opportunity , asserting that he encourages terrorism -- a claim that was contradicted by the head of @entity1 's top security service -- and repeating the mantra that @entity59 is not a legitimate peace partner			1
in 2011 , he reportedly quashed the @entity21 leader 's draft peace agreement that had been secretly negotiated with former @entity1 president @entity70			0
in a less guarded moment , @entity0 told @entity1 writer @entity72 that the @entity1 - @entity21 conflict was " insoluble			1
" @entity0 's duplicity on the @entity21 issue has led to a highly dysfunctional relationship with the @entity36 administration , which has tried , in vain , to broker an @entity1 - @entity21 agreement			2
he made a farce of last year 's @entity82 - brokered peace talks by increasing settlement work fourfold during this negotiating period			0
adding fuel to the fire , @entity0 has repeatedly injected himself into @entity37 politics , most recently with his acceptance of an invitation by @entity24 speaker @entity90 to address @entity91 -- a move that was widely seen as a partisan ploy to undercut the @entity24			1
@entity36 has yet to respond to @entity0 's most recent statements , which can only serve to further damage @entity96 's ties with @entity56 while contributing to @entity1 's growing isolation			2
one @entity99 government after another has begun to turn its back on the @entity1 government , taking steps to recognize a @entity21 state since it appears less and less likely that one will emerge as a result of negotiations			0
but criticism of @entity0 's approach to the @entity21 issue has also come from none other than the @entity1 security community , many of whose members are alarmed at @entity1 's deteriorating position in the international community in general and its schism with @entity96 in particular			2
a broad array of former generals , ex-heads of @entity118 military intelligence , and former chiefs of the @entity120 and @entity122 intelligence services have long argued that the status quo is unsustainable and that a two - state solution is vital to @entity1 's future as a @entity51 and democratic state			0
in the last month , nearly 200 of these former high - ranking security officials launched a campaign demanding a change in leadership in light of what they view as @entity0 's failure to take any diplomatic initiative while harming one of @entity1 's greatest security assets : its relationship with the @entity37			1
@entity1 did not heed the ex-security officials ' warnings when they voted to retain @entity0 as their prime minister			1
but while @entity0 's come - from - behind victory may attest to his shrewd political instincts , it will also come with a high cost for his country .			0
