it 's been more than 13 years since 2,753 people were reported missing in lower @entity3 after the attacks on the @entity5			1
although death certificates have been issued for all 2,753 , the work to identify each victim continues			1
in fact , it 's far from over : some 40 % of the victims have not yet been identified , according to the city 's office of chief medical examiner			2
the most recent identified victim is @entity15 , a 26 - year - old @entity16 native who worked for @entity17 on the 97th floor of the @entity19			1
@entity15 's mother said friday that the news " was a bit of a shock , " but that it means that she can " finally put everything to rest			1
" " it kind of opened up all of the old wounds and old pains initially , " @entity27 told @entity1 's @entity28			0
" i guess it kind of put to rest any -- i would n't say doubt -- ( because ) we were n't doubtful about the outcome , but it kind of gave us closure			0
" according to the medical examiner , @entity15 's dna samples were recovered during the original recovery effort from 2001 to 2002			1
until this week , they resided with other remains that have not been identified			2
a recent retesting , however , yielded a new result			0
" every time there 's a new development in a dna processing or technique , they go back and they recheck every single remain that they have in the repository at the museum , " she told @entity28			0
" and this time ( @entity15 's ) matched			2
" the identification of @entity15 puts the total number of identifications from the @entity5 at 1,640 , meaning there are still 1,113 more to go			1
daunting , but not insurmountable			0
" the me 's office is not going to give up , " @entity57 said			0
" i hope for everyone that lost a loved one there , that they 'll have that closure someday , and , hopefully , sooner rather than later			0
