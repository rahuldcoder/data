@entity3 permanently deleted all the emails on the private server she used to do official business as secretary of state , the @entity1 lawmaker who subpoenaed the emails said late friday			1
rep. @entity9 of @entity10 , chairman of the @entity11 investigating the attacks on the @entity14 consulate in @entity15 , said @entity17 's lawyer informed him of the news			1
" secretary @entity17 unilaterally decided to wipe her server clean and permanently delete all emails from her personal server , " @entity9 said in a statement			2
@entity9 had also asked that @entity17 turn over her server to the @entity26 inspector general for an independent review			2
@entity17 's lawyer , @entity28 , said no. in his letter to @entity9 , @entity28 said the former secretary of state " chose not to keep her non-record personal emails			1
" " thus , there are no ... e-mails from secretary @entity17 's tenure as secretary of state on the server for any review , even if such review were appropriate or legally authorized , " he wrote			1
but she " has maintained and preserved copies " of work - related , or potentially work - related emails she turned over to the @entity26 late last year			1
@entity28 did not specify whether the emails were kept in paper or digital form			0
in december , @entity17 turned over 55,000 pages of emails to the @entity26			2
@entity17 has asked that those roughly 30,000 emails be released to the public			0
@entity26 officials have said they will release them after they have been reviewed			0
" representatives of secretary @entity17 's office have been in touch with the committee and the @entity26 to make clear that she would like her emails made public as soon as possible and that she 's ready and willing to come and appear herself for a hearing open to the @entity14 public , " @entity17 spokesman @entity53 said in an email			1
@entity9 said it was n't clear when @entity17 erased the server , but it appears to have been wiped after october 2014 , when the @entity26 asked @entity17 to return her official emails to the department			2
the chairman subpoenaed @entity17 's emails regarding @entity72 and , last month , the @entity26 turned over about 300 emails to the committee			1
@entity17 did not have an official government email account , so her personal server was the primary repository for her emails during her time as secretary of state			0
" not only was the secretary the sole arbiter of what was a public record , she also summarily decided to delete all emails from her server , ensuring no one could check behind her analysis in the public interest , " @entity9 said			0
but in his letter , @entity28 said the federal law governing record retention requires that each federal employee individually decide what emails must be preserved			0
" the manner in which secretary @entity17 assisted the @entity26 in fulfilling its responsibilities under the act is consistent with the obligations of every federal employee , " @entity28 wrote			0
@entity9 has also subpoenaed the emails of about a dozen @entity17 aides at the @entity26			1
that request is still outstanding .			0
