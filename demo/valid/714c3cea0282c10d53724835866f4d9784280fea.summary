@entity1 , @entity2 more than 50 people were killed and scores wounded in a series of suicide bombings in northern @entity2 on saturday , witnesses and authorities told @entity3			1
the blasts occurred in @entity10 , the capital of the tumultuous @entity12 state , at the city 's main market , a fish market and a bus station			2
four suicide bombers -- three women and a man -- carried out the attacks , according to witnesses			1
no group immediately claimed responsibility for the bloodshed			0
but the @entity24 extremist group @entity23 has been behind many similar attacks in northern @entity2 and beyond , killing hundreds in recent months as part of its terrorist campaign to bring its twisted version of @entity32 law to the region			1
@entity34 , a @entity12 state police spokesman , said at least 54 people were killed and another 139 wounded in the suicide attacks			1
@entity37 said he and others involved in the rescue operation had taken about 50 bodies to the @entity42 morgue			0
" this toll does n't include those taken to three other hospitals , " @entity37 said			0
" therefore , the â€Ž final ( death ) toll may be higher			0
" in the first blast , a woman dressed in a hijab got off a motorized rickshaw and blew herself up outside the @entity53 fish market around 11:20 a.m. ( 5:20 a.m. et ) , fish trader @entity47 said			0
the next attack took place about an hour later outside monday market , the main one in the city , where people were lined up to go through security			1
those measures -- in which people are checked for explosives and guns -- were set up because of the spate of @entity23 attacks in the city and region			1
two women joined the female security line , one of whom " blew herself up , causing minimal casualty , " said witness @entity74			0
then , as people gathered to help , the second woman detonated her explosives , said @entity74 , who was waiting outside the market in the male security line			0
the third attack occurred at a bus station			2
" he came in our midst near the bus station and pressed a remote device he was holding in his hand , " a wounded survivor who requested anonymity for his personal safety said from @entity42			2
such attacks , sadly , are nothing new for @entity12 , one of those hit hardest by @entity23 and the @entity2 military 's campaign to stop them			1
the terrorist group has not only bombed crowded markets but attacked churches and mosques , raided villages , and kidnapped people young and old -- most famously the more than 200 girls taken last april from a school in @entity104 .			0

police official : at least 54 are killed and 139 wounded
