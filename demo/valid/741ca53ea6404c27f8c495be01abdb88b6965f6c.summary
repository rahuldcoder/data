@entity0 are on course for a first ever @entity3 title after a thrilling semifinal victory over @entity5 , secured off the penultimate ball of the match			1
chasing an adjusted target of 298 in just 43 overs after a rain interrupted the match at @entity12 , @entity8 hit a six right at the death to confirm victory and send the @entity16 crowd into raptures			1
it is the first time @entity0 has ever reached a @entity3 final , and it will play either @entity20 or @entity21 on sunday			1
@entity23 pair face each other in @entity25 on thursday			1
not the first time in the sport , rain played a part			2
@entity5 were motoring with the bat before a two - hour delay for poor weather			1
though its total was escalated by the @entity34 -- used to calculate a revised target in the event of a rain delay -- @entity0 held firm thanks to @entity8			1
his 84 not out underpinned its innings and it was fitting that he delivered the final blow , smashing @entity42 for six off the second last ball to spark jubilant scenes at @entity12			2
" i do n't think this win is for myself or the team , but everyone here , " @entity8 said at the post-match presentation			1
" the supporters have been amazing			2
" i think we timed the pace of the innings to perfection			2
i was n't as calm as i looked			0
when you have 45,000 fans screaming at you every ball ... " it has been an absolute pleasure playing in front of this crowd			1
we have had a good run			0
it is the first final we have been in as @entity0			1
" we are a very level team , we will approach it as any other game			0
nothing going in my mind when i hit the six			0
i do n't even know where the ball went			0
" @entity5 , who themselves have never reached the final , have been accused of choking in past installments of the one - day competition			1
but that indictment can not be leveled at it after one of the most dramatic matches in @entity3 history			1
it had recovered from 114 - 3 in the 27th over to 216 - 3 after 38 overs thanks to some fierce hitting from captain @entity83 and @entity84 , before the rain came			2
with the game stopped for two hours , it finally reached 281 off its reduced 43 overs , du plessis top scoring with 82			2
@entity0 's target was upgraded via @entity92 / @entity91 , a calculation that takes into account how many overs were left and how many wickets had been lost , to 298			1
@entity98 skipper @entity97 got it off to a fast start with a 22 - ball half - century but after he was dismissed it wobbled , and needed 139 from 22 overs			1
but @entity8 was the steadying hand , judging his innings perfectly			1
and though he was dropped in the penultimate over , he struck the telling blow off @entity42 to seal victory and inflict a fourth semifinal defeat on @entity5			1
" it was a great advertisement for cricket , " @entity97 said at the post-match presentation			2
" everybody involved will remember this for the rest of their lives			0
" what a great innings from @entity8			1
he came out of wilderness not long ago			0
the greatest time of our lives			0
we have enjoyed the experience			0
" i hope the crowds are all dreaming the way we are			0
gee it would be nice to win it			0
we do n't mind whom we face in the final			1
" they are both quality sides , but we know if we play the way we want to we are a good chance			0
" should @entity20 beat @entity21 at the @entity133 , then the joint hosts of the @entity3 will meet in the final in @entity135			1
" it was an amazing game of cricket , " @entity83 said			2
" probably the most electric crowd i have ever heard in my life			2
i guess the best team has come out on top			0
we gave it our best			0
" we left it all out there			0
it is going to take a while to recover			0
the bigger picture is for the people back home			0
i hope they can still be proud of us			0
