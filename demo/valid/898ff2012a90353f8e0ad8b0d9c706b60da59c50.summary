last month , my husband and i took our daughters to a @entity6 women 's basketball game			1
we live nearby , had already attended a men 's game and were excited for our girls , one of whom plays basketball , to watch college women in action			1
when we walked into the arena , my mouth practically dropped to the floor			0
only a handful of people were there , quite a contrast from the nearly packed house for the men 's team			1
it must be winter break , i thought			0
sure , the @entity6 women 's team has n't had a great season for years -- and this year was n't much different			1
still , only a handful of spectators to cheer on women who were clearly standouts in their high schools to make it to a college basketball team ? i sat on the bench , cheered the women and fumed			0
how to @entity37 # @entity36 a few weeks later , the @entity40 women 's basketball team did something no other @entity43 men 's team had done before , racking up 30 wins and zero losses during the regular season and beating the @entity43 season record of 28 - 0 held by the 1970 - 71 @entity49 men 's team			1
( @entity40 ended up losing in the second round of the @entity52 tournament , finishing with a 31 - 1 record			0
) the @entity40 team garnered national headlines , which was great , but i still wondered what it was going to take for women 's sports to get the same attention as men 's sports -- meaning an equal number of fans , tv rights , marketing endorsements , you name it			1
is such a day even possible ? consider salaries alone			0
the average salary for a @entity70 player is $ 72,000 , which does n't include bonuses and benefits , while the average salary for an @entity75 player is around $ 5 million , or about 70 times what the average female basketball player makes			1
and look at the differences in coverage			0
the @entity82 teams for the men 's @entity52 basketball tournament got front page attention in monday 's @entity86			1
the women ? a story without a photo deep in the sports section			2
i met @entity92 , a three - time olympic gold medalist in swimming , during a spectacular and inspirational women 's conference in @entity96 , @entity97 , last week called @entity98 , where i moderated panels on issues affecting women			1
" this connection with sports and masculinity is a very tough nut to crack			0
people have been trying to crack it for a long time , " said @entity92 , who has devoted her career to the advancement of girls and women in sports			2
why has coverage of women 's sports stopped post-olympics ? more than 40 years after the enactment of @entity119 , a law that says that any school receiving federal funds can not discriminate based on sex , there are still huge disparities , she said , with men getting $ 190 million more per year in college athletic scholarships than women			1
" it 's appalling what these huge differences are			2
any fifth - grader can walk into your average high school or college softball baseball facility and say , ' duh , that 's not equal			2
' " @entity92 , who is chief executive officer of the advocacy group @entity136 , said even though @entity119 requires that women get the same access to media and support that men get , it 's not happening			1
" the coupling of sexism and sport , having this be an exclusionary practice , is still a strong one , " said the 1984 @entity143 champion			2
attitudes about women and sports still have a long way to go before we get to true gender equality , based on a recent poll by @entity157 , the brand that brought us the viral # @entity36 video sensation			2
while a majority of the 1,800 men and women polled said both genders were equal in math and science , they said sports was the one area where they believe there are differences			2
a significant percentage of both women and men said men are better at sports , with 32 % of women feeling that way and 47 % of men , the poll found			2
@entity180 , a member of the @entity182 @entity181 , called the findings " disappointing " but said women 's sports is still young , with @entity119 only a few decades old			1
" it 's just a gradual growth process that we kind of have to see through , " said @entity180 , who appears in the most recent # @entity36 video , this one released for @entity186 this month , showcasing women proudly talking about how they shoot , score and do chemistry like a girl			2
@entity180 admits the changes in women 's sports might not come during her hockey career but says she believes they will eventually come , especially as more women play the game			1
when she started playing hockey 15 years ago , there were few girls who did			0
today , you walk into a local rink and you 'll find girls ' and boys ' teams , she said			0
" it 's a slow process , but as long as you are changing the stereotype , and you are really empowering women and girls to feel proud of who they are and not hindering their progress in any way , i think we are going to see sport get to where it needs to be			2
" @entity217 , whose 9 - year - old daughter , @entity218 , plays basketball and baseball on boys ' teams , also thinks it will take time to create the opportunities for women , which will help change the mindset about women and sports			2
her main focus , she says , is on making sure girls like her daughter can play the sports they love			0
in june , her daughter will play in an all - girls baseball tournament in @entity235 organized by a program called @entity237 for all , which was founded to ensure that girls can play baseball when they are young and continue playing the game when they are older			0
" what i think is gaining traction is an awareness of female athletes in general and recognition of their strength , skill and determination -- and that yes , this has some effect on the popularity and growth of women 's sports programs , " said @entity217 , creator of the blog @entity242			1
" there seems to be a greater push for girls and women to be taken seriously in sports			2
" girls ' and women 's sports are growing in popularity as participation increases , said @entity266 , chief executive officer of the @entity267			1
@entity266 points to @entity182 women 's soccer star @entity268 , for example , who has over 1.5 million followers on @entity272 , and how the upcoming @entity273 in @entity274 is a trending topic worldwide			1
that said , girls have more than 1.3 million fewer opportunities to play sports than boys do in high school and about 63,000 fewer participation slots at the college level , according to @entity266			0
" once sports are recognized as a birthright for both genders , the rest will fall into place , " she said			0
helping get us there , she said , is a new generation of moms who played sports as a result of @entity119 , which became law in 1972			0
" these women identify as athletes and women 's sports fans , and they will now pass down their experiences to their daughters , " she said			1
getting women into the stands is key to winning television coverage and the big salaries that come with that exposure , said @entity308 , a sports cinematographer and father of two girls			0
" in sports tv , the tail wags the dog			0
the money goes where the audience is , " said @entity308 , who is the husband of @entity314 , the co-founder of the digital literacy site @entity316			0
" @entity320 will go to women 's sports as soon as an audience wants to watch women , so the best way to support women athletes is by attending women 's sports in the first place			1
" @entity329 of @entity330 said he and a friend took their young daughters to a @entity336 women 's basketball game for @entity337 for the third year in a row			1
" in my humble opinion , any father who does n't take their young daughters to watch women 's sports ( at all levels -- grammar school through pro ) is missing a chance to expose their children to the opportunities that await them , " said @entity329 , whose daughter is 7			1
" long - term , parents taking kids to women 's games and women 's teams promoting themselves in schools has to be helpful to establishing widespread popularity , generations at a time			1
" getting more people into the stands and seeing more girls play more sports will bring about change , many women say			0
so too will seeing new leaders emerge who believe in gender equality in all areas , including sports			0
" sports are a microcosm of life , " said @entity266			0
" as we begin to see a more diverse group of men and women in leadership and decision - making roles throughout the industry , we should also see significant changes in media , sponsorship and other fundamental areas of support			0
" @entity92 , the former @entity143 champion , told me about a case she recently learned about involving dramatically unequal facilities for the women 's softball and men 's baseball teams at a public high school in @entity393			1
" it tells the baseball players you 're more important , " she said			0
" that 's equally as unhealthy , as for a girl to hear that she 's not as important as for him to hear that he 's more important			0
" " when the leadership says , ' we 're going to make this just as important , ' " change will come , she said			0
what do you think it will take for women 's sports to get the same attention as men 's sports ? share your thoughts with @entity411 on @entity272 @ kellywallacetv or @entity413 on @entity414 .			1
