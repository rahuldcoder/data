@entity0 in @entity2 , @entity3 , will publicly discuss on monday the results of their investigation into an alleged gang rape of a @entity8 student , which was initially reported last year in @entity11 magazine			1
the police findings could put to rest a complicated controversy about the alleged gang rape of a female student at a fraternity party			1
the accusation has been controversial because of the nature of such a crime and because the accusation itself has been clouded by subsequent questions about the @entity11 article			1
after the account was published last fall , @entity11 magazine later apologized for discrepancies in its article about the alleged gang rape after friends of the victim expressed doubts about the woman 's account and the accused fraternity chapter denied key details			1
@entity1 senior media correspondent @entity36 described @entity11 's announcement as falling short of a full - scale retraction			1
it remains unclear what really happened to the female student , @entity36 said			2
" we are in the phase here where @entity11 is trying to figure that out , " @entity36 said in december			0
" they 've apologized , but not retracted			0
so they 're not saying the story is false			0
they 're just saying there are some questions they need to figure out the answers to still			0
" the @entity54 will hold its press conference at 2 p.m. et on monday			0
@entity11 editors had chosen not to contact the man who allegedly " orchestrated the attack on ' @entity59 ' ( the woman who was the subject of the article ) nor any of the men she claimed participated in the attack for fear of retaliation against her , " a decision the magazine said it regretted			0
" in the face of new information , there now appear to be discrepancies in @entity59 's account , and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced , " @entity11 said in december			2
@entity11 managing editor @entity77 later tweeted that " the truth would have been better served by getting the other side of the story			0
" @entity8 pledges zero - tolerance in rape cases the article chronicled the school 's failure to respond to that alleged assault			1
it prompted an emergency meeting by the school 's governing board and the announcement of a zero - tolerance approach toward sexual assault cases			2
according to the magazine , @entity59 , who at the time had just started her freshman year at the @entity2 school , claimed she was raped by seven men at @entity100 fraternity , while two more gave encouragement , during a party			0
however , the @entity8 's @entity100 chapter did not have a party the night of september 28 , 2012 , the date when the alleged attack occurred , or at all that weekend , the chapter said			1
the chapter 's lawyer , @entity108 , told @entity1 that is proved by email and fraternity records			2
@entity108 said there were other discrepancies in the accuser 's account			2
for example , the accused orchestrator of the alleged rape did not belong to the fraternity , the fraternity house has no side staircase , and there were no pledges at that time of year			1
@entity59 told the magazine she hurried out a side staircase after the incident and said her attackers egged each other on , asking , " do n't you want to be a brother ? " @entity1 's @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 contributed to this report .			0
