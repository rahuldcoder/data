the attack on @entity3 's famed @entity2 is just the latest evidence that parts of @entity6 and @entity7 have become a magnet for @entity10 extremism			1
@entity3 -- lying just across the @entity11 from @entity12 , but bordered on one side by @entity14 and on the other by @entity16 -- has until now not suffered the kind of large - scale terror attacks seen in both those nations in recent years			2
but it has emerged as a place of increasing concern as the threat of @entity10 extremism has intensified in the region			1
islamist terrorists also have struck in @entity16 , where they killed at least 37 hostages at a gas field in 2013 , and in @entity14 , where terrorists killed the @entity30 ambassador and three others in 2012 and where @entity32 has established a beachhead in the east			1
@entity37 's @entity36 offshoot @entity38 ( @entity38 ) , which has its roots in @entity16 , has captured territory in @entity41 and taken hostages -- often @entity12 -- in countries such as @entity43 and @entity44			1
so what is the world doing about it ? the @entity30 has created a military command in @entity7 and also established a special operations base in @entity49 , which borders @entity50 in the @entity51			1
@entity52 has sent troops to @entity41			2
and , as @entity0 recently reported from @entity56 , @entity55 militaries have trained special forces from several northern @entity36 nations to take on the @entity59			2
here 's a country - by - country look -- although not exhaustive -- at how @entity10 extremism has reared its head across a swath of @entity7			1
@entity16 is home to a long - running @entity10 insurgency			1
in perhaps the highest - profile incident , @entity10 militants attacked the @entity69 oil and gas plant in southern @entity16 in january 2013			1
at least 37 hostages , including three @entity30 citizens , died in the seizure of , and ensuing special forces assault on , the remote facility			2
dozens of assailants also died in the days - long siege			2
the attack was the work of the @entity80 , which translates as the " signatories in @entity82			0
" last september , another @entity10 group beheaded a 55 - year - old @entity52 hiker , @entity84 , after seizing him as he walked in @entity85 in central @entity16			1
days earlier , the outfit -- @entity87 , a splinter group of @entity38 -- had pledged allegiance to @entity32			1
militants affiliated with @entity38 had previously also kidnapped foreigners in @entity16 , including @entity91 and @entity92			1
in 2007 , @entity38 launched a suicide bombing campaign in @entity16 , which included a deadly bombing against the @entity96 headquarters in @entity97			1
in january , a suicide bombing and gun attack on a hotel in the capital , @entity102 , killed 10 people , including an @entity30			0
the attack was swiftly claimed by @entity105 , @entity32 ' name for the province			1
politicians in @entity102 disputed the claim			0
besides its growing presence in @entity102 , @entity32 is now the dominant force in @entity112 in eastern @entity14 and controls parts of the town center of @entity115 , the hometown of former @entity14 strongman @entity116			1
before the advent of @entity32 , an @entity10 group called @entity118 was blamed by the @entity30 for carrying out the september 11 , 2012 , attack on the @entity30 @entity120 in @entity121 in which ambassador @entity122 was killed			1
@entity124 computer expert @entity123 and former @entity126 @entity125 and @entity127 , then acting as security contractors , also died			0
in 2012 , @entity10 extremists capitalized on chaos in @entity41 after a military coup and uprising by @entity134 tribesmen to seize control of a large piece of northern @entity41 , an area the size of @entity52			1
@entity52 intervened militarily in early 2013 and helped to push back the @entity59			0
since then , @entity41 's government has battled various rebel factions , mostly in its northern region , with the help of @entity52 and @entity36 forces			0
recent attacks include a shooting earlier this month at a bar popular with expatriates in the capital , @entity149 , which killed five people , including @entity52 and @entity152 citizens , authorities said			2
a @entity36 jihadist group , @entity153 , claimed responsibility for the attack , according to @entity44 news agency @entity156			0
@entity38 issued a warning to @entity52 via jihadist websites in january , following terror attacks in @entity160 , stating that " @entity52 pays the cost of its violence on @entity59 countries and the violation of their sanctity , " citing the presence of its soldiers in @entity41			1
according to analysis by @entity173 , despite the shift of jihadist activity east toward @entity14 , " @entity44 is still an aspirational target for jihadist groups due to its military co-operation with @entity52 and @entity16			2
" jihadist groups including @entity38 and the @entity80 operate in the porous border areas between @entity44 , @entity16 , @entity41 , @entity43 and @entity14			1
militants have in the past kidnapped foreign workers for ransom , including three @entity92 in 2011 , according to @entity182 's			0
however , since 2011 jihadist activity in the country has declined			0
@entity44 troops joined the fight against @entity38 militants in @entity41			1
militant group @entity188 has waged a campaign of terror in mostly northern @entity191 for over a decade			1
it has attacked the country 's police , military , banks , bus stations and crowded markets , as well carrying out a string of church bombings			0
perhaps the most notorious incident came last april , when @entity188 militants kidnapped more than 200 teenage girls from a boarding school in @entity204 , in @entity205			1
most of the girls remain missing			0
in january this year , hundreds of @entity188 gunmen seized the town of @entity210 and neighboring villages in northern @entity191 , as well as a multinational military base , leaving bodies scattered everywhere and as many as 2,000 people feared dead			1
the group 's stated aim is to institute @entity217 , or @entity59 law			0
earlier this month , in an audio message purportedly from leader @entity220 , @entity188 pledged allegiance to @entity32			1
it had previously declared ties to @entity38			1
@entity223 started with a goal of waging a war against the @entity50 government in an effort to implement a stricter form of @entity59 law , or @entity217			1
it has since shifted focus to terrorist attacks in @entity50 and beyond , notably neighboring @entity232			0
its most high - profile attack came in that country in 2013 , when gunmen struck at @entity237 's upscale @entity236 , pulling out weapons and gunning down shoppers			0
the gunmen were accused of torturing some hostages before killing them			0
as many as 67 people died in the siege			0
the group has carried out numerous attacks in @entity50 's capital , @entity246 , and elsewhere			0
just last week , its target was government offices in the city of @entity250			0
it has also recently called for attacks on shopping malls in the @entity30 , @entity254 and @entity255			0
the @entity256 said this week that a key @entity223 operative connected to the westgate mall attack , named as @entity259 , was killed recently by a @entity30 drone strike			2
in september , @entity223 leader @entity261 was also killed in a @entity30 airstrike near @entity263			2
gunmen who besieged the @entity2 in @entity266 are thought to have claimed 23 lives , most of them foreign tourists			0
@entity271 spokesman @entity270 told national radio that the assailants were @entity59 , but authorities have n't been more specific than that			0
nine arrests have been made in connection with the attack			0
@entity32 claimed responsibility for the attack in an audio message posted online thursday			2
@entity0 can not independently verify the authenticity of the audio statement			0
the attack occurred even as the country 's democratically elected @entity285 was meeting to discuss new anti-terror legislation			0
up to 3,000 @entity3 are believed to have traveled to @entity288 and @entity289 to fight as jihadists , more than any other country , according to the @entity292 for the @entity293 in @entity294			0
the fear is that many of these fighters will return to @entity36 to join @entity32 - affiliated groups there and carry out attacks			1
@entity37 's @entity36 affiliate is also a threat			2
in late 2012 , @entity38 set up a branch in @entity3 called the @entity303 , a 60 - strong @entity305 outfit composed of @entity3 , @entity16 , and some @entity14			2
the group , believed to include fighters driven out of @entity41 by @entity52 forces , has been responsible for a string of attacks on @entity3 security services in mountainous @entity313 region along the @entity16 border			2
@entity0 's @entity315 and @entity316 contributed to this report .			0
