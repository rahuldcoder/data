what 's your company doing this year for @entity4 ? if your workplace is like most , the answer is a big fat nothing			1
instead of leveraging the @entity10 's annual tournament and turning it into a genuine bonding experience between colleagues , most organizations pretend it is n't happening			1
on the surface , ignoring a sporting event that takes place during regular work hours might appear like sound business practice			1
after all , companies need to generate profit , and it 's hard to generate profit when your employees are huddled around a television , right ? wrong			1
what this perspective overlooks is that productivity is n't simply a function of how many hours we spend at the office			2
it also depends on the quality of our workplace experience			2
and one critical feature of that experience is how closely connected we feel to our colleagues			2
research has consistently demonstrated that we are more effective at our jobs when we feel attached to the people around us			1
how do strong colleague relationships elevate our performance ? for one thing , they make us more motivated			2
when you and your colleagues are close , failing to perform your duties generates more than a dissatisfied customer or an unhappy manager -- it means letting down your friends			2
the social pressure to achieve results can serve as a stronger motivator than anything a boss can say			2
closer connections also foster a sense of trust and more candid dialogue			2
studies comparing the collaboration patterns of friends to mere acquaintances indicate that friends are more willing to ask for help and more comfortable speaking up when a colleague is off on the wrong track			2
performance aside , workplace friendships benefit organizations for another reason : employees with richer friendships tend to stay on with their company for longer periods of time			1
despite these considerable benefits , at most companies , friendships are an afterthought			1
to motivate employees , managers tend to rely on bonuses , promotions , and salary increases , ignoring the fact that as humans , we all have a basic psychological need for meaningful relationships			1
yet the research is clear : when we feel valued and respected by those around us , we 're not only more motivated -- we 're also happier , healthier , and more productive			1
for too many organizations , investing in quality employee relationships means one thing : team - building exercises			2
think ice breakers , trust falls and scavenger hunts			0
every year , corporations spend millions on off - site retreats and weekend getaways packed with cringeworthy activities that purportedly foster better communication			0
but here 's the truth : while awkward collaborations may spark brief experiences of closeness , they rarely translate into lasting friendships			1
so what does ? studies suggest three factors are essential to the development of authentic , meaningful friendships : familiarity ( being around the same colleague often ) , similarity ( finding commonalities in your background ) , and self - disclosure ( revealing personal information about yourself every now and then , and having your co-worker do the same )			1
few activities include all three of these elements			0
this explains why close relationships usually take years to develop			0
but interestingly , office game - viewing parties come close			0
they present opportunities for colleagues to mingle with those from other departments and connect over shared interests			0
for many , the @entity10 basketball tournament is associated with their experience at college , which leads them to share stories about their past , prompting co-workers to do the same			1
unlike team - building experiences that compel employees to engage with one another , game - viewing parties position people to connect voluntarily			1
and that feature can make all the difference			0
in recent years , a number of forward - thinking workplaces have begun leveraging @entity4 in intelligent ways			0
@entity157 , for example , an international marketing agency based in @entity155 , invites employees to watch tournament games on projection screens in conference rooms and the office cafeteria			1
to address the fact that not everyone has the time to follow college basketball , a @entity164 financial services firm called @entity169 offers a free " bracketology " class , where nonenthusiasts can get caught up on this year 's favorites and collect advice before filling out their brackets			0
a number of organizations , including office furniture manufacturer @entity179 , even serve game - day snacks , such as pizza , popcorn , and chicken wings , to simulate the viewing experience of a sports bar , minus the alcohol			0
in addition to organizing a vibrant workplace gathering , there are also opportunities for making better use of the office tournament pool			0
here 's one idea : instead of having employees pay an entry fee ( which discourages nonfans from joining in ) , sponsor prizes so that everyone participates			1
then , go beyond recognizing individual contestants and reward the team or department with the highest average score			0
this way , employees have reason to root for one another , fostering a sense of collaboration			1
another approach worth considering : using the office pool as a motivational tool			0
some years ago , @entity213 , a sales organization in @entity214 , launched a competition among its salespeople in the weeks before the @entity10 tournament			0
the more appointments a salesperson secured with potential clients , the sooner he or she could select a team in the office draft			0
total cost to @entity213 for furnishing prizes : $ 300 , plus the price of a personalized basketball jersey			0
total impact on the business : a 35 % jump in appointments , not to mention a boost in office morale			0
as the @entity238 tips off this month , organizational leaders would be wise to re-examine their approach to @entity4			1
instead of treating the tournament as a nuisance that prevents employees from working , perhaps it 's time we considered embracing it for what it is : an inexpensive opportunity for bringing our work teams closer together			1
without the trust falls .			0

@entity252 : companies should encourage their employees to bond over @entity238 games
research shows the value of cultivating friendships among co-workers
