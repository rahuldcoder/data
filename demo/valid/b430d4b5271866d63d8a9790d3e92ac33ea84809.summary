six months ago this week @entity0 received a panicked phone call from his friend and fellow student			1
" i was in my dormitory writing a paper and a friend called me in desperation from a bus			2
he said they were being shot by police , " @entity0 explained			2
he has not heard from his friend since			2
@entity0 is a student at the @entity14 of @entity15 , in @entity17 state			2
his friend is one of 43 students who were subjected to enforced disappearance in september of 2014			1
as the days and weeks passed , the @entity21 authorities stalled and obfuscated			1
despite worldwide attention on the issue , they have , for months , failed to properly investigate all lines of the case , especially the worrying allegations of complicity by armed forces			1
in january , i traveled to the @entity15 college			2
there , in the college hall , surrounded by murals of @entity21 's revolutionary leaders , i met the families of the disappeared students			1
for the past six months , mothers , fathers , sisters and brothers , as well as other relatives and community members , have been campaigning relentlessly , demanding answers from the authorities about what happened to their loved ones			1
it was an emotional and difficult meeting ; there were tears of sadness and disappointment			2
mothers and fathers spoke of counting the seconds since they last saw their sons , and expressed frustration at how they and their boys have been portrayed as troublemakers by the authorities and the media			1
these are people who have lived in poverty , whose communities have been historically abandoned by the state ; for many , their missing son was the first of their families to go to school			0
now , so many hopes and dreams have been shattered			0
i have witnessed all kinds of human tragedies , but there can be few things as painful as the torment of not knowing where a loved one is			0
the past months have been a roller - coaster for these families , and all of us who support and accompany their struggles			1
but a constant factor has been the @entity21 government 's failure to respond effectively and address these grave human rights violations			1
a prime example of this is how , on november 7 , 2014 , the authorities announced that human remains had been uncovered in a rubbish dump and a nearby river in @entity93 , and the then - attorney general @entity94 announced weeks later that he was prepared to close the case			1
according to the prosecutor , he was satisfied that the findings of his office 's investigation were sufficient proof of what happened			0
however , only one of the missing students has been identified through dna tests			1
other human remains are still being tested , and it seems that the whole investigation so far has been based only on the testimonies of three gang members			0
you do n't have to be attorney general to know that this is far from conclusive proof			0
but amidst the sadness of the families i met , there was a calm and steely resolve			0
these 43 mothers and fathers have decided they can not accept the silence or half - answers they have been given by the government , instead they are demanding the truth			1
one father explained to me how the horror of that day has transformed them all from peasant farmers to detectives and campaigners			0
if the authorities wo n't push for proper investigations , then they will			2
they have been campaigning vocally for the truth ever since			0
the tragic reality is that these 43 students were only the most recent we have heard of in a long line of the disappeared			1
according to official figures , 24,748 people have disappeared or gone missing in @entity21 since 2007 , and almost half of them during the current administration of president @entity147			1
fortunately the international community has stepped up			0
recently the @entity149 established a group of independent experts to review the official investigation into the enforced disappearance of the students			2
in february , the @entity156 ' committee on @entity157 produced recommendations on how to deal with disappearances in @entity21			1
the committee concluded that there is a context of generalized disappearances in a great part of the country			0
it has asked the government to prevent acts of intimidation and harassment toward the families of the disappeared and has suggested setting up a dna database of missing people and a registry of disappearances			2
however , even these international calls are going unheeded			0
just hours after the @entity156 committee published its conclusions and recommendations , the @entity21 government disregarded them			1
this is a worrying sign that the government is not stepping up and taking this human rights crisis seriously			0
on march 3 , @entity21 appointed @entity183 as the new federal attorney general			1
we had hoped that she would forge on where her predecessor failed and get to the root of the corruption and impunity that lies behind this terrible tragedy			0
however , her recent statements -- that the disappearance of the 43 students is an " isolated case " and that there is no confirmation of grave human rights violations in this case -- are shocking			1
for @entity0 and the others waiting for news , it is only full accountability and pursuit of justice that can address the horrors they have seen and experienced			0
" the government 's response has been nothing but disrespectful and insensitive , " @entity0 said			0
" i 'm alarmed about what happened but i 'm not afraid			0
we will never give up our fight for justice			0
" @entity215 and i will be there alongside them every step of the way .			0
