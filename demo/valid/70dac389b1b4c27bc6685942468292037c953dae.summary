but not quite so many at one time			0
three major characters -- @entity7 , @entity8 ( both of @entity9 , a @entity11 company , like @entity1 ) and @entity12 -- came out with new looks ( and costumes in two cases ) thursday			1
superman and @entity8 are no stranger to change over time , but these are pretty different from what we 're used to			1
wonder woman is back to wearing pants ( similar to her style circa 2010 , not to mention a brief time in the 1970s ) along with something of a turtleneck and body armor			0
superman looks the most casual that we 've ever seen him , simply in a t - shirt and jeans , and decidedly shorter hair			0
he also looks like someone you might not want to come across in a dark alley			0
as for @entity12 ( who never really died , by the way ) , he 's getting ready for his promised tv show by debuting a modern look -- one that makes it much easier to see why @entity38 and @entity39 have been fighting for his affections all of these years			2
it 's been a whirlwind time for comic book fans , and there will be a lot to get used to .			1
