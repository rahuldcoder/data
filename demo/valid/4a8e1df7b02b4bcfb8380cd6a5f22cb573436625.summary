@entity1 it 's a phenomenon that 's been linked to a dragon , a black squirrel and @entity5 , the magical dog of heaven			2
mythologies from across the globe have blamed them all for eating the sun. in reality , solar eclipses , like the one that can be seen across parts of the @entity15 today , are down to an amazing coincidence			1
the moon and sun are at just the right distance away from the @entity21 that they appear to be of the same apparent size in the sky even though the sun is about 400 times larger than the moon			1
on occasion , the sun , moon and @entity21 are perfectly aligned so that when the moon passes in front of the sun it casts a shadow on the @entity21 , blocking the light			1
but that 's not the whole story			2
a total eclipse can only be seen in the narrow corridor known as the " path of totality " --- or the " inner umbral shadow			2
" the area where the sun 's rays are only partially obscured is called the " penumbra			1
" today the moon 's shadow falls across parts of @entity49 , @entity50 and the @entity51			1
millions will be in the penumbra part of the shadow and able to see a partial eclipse but if you want to catch the full majesty of the 2015 totality it will require a trip to the @entity60 , @entity61 or the @entity62 between the @entity63 and @entity64			2
you can find out whether you will be able to see the eclipse by watching our animation			0
solar eclipses are relatively common -- partial eclipses are visible somewhere on @entity21 most years -- but not necessarily in the same region			1
you might wait hundreds of years between two total eclipses at the same place			0
and not all eclipses are the same			0
the moon follows an elliptical orbit around the @entity21 which means it is sometimes closer to us -- at " perigee " -- and sometimes further away -- at " apogee			1
" at apogee , the moon does n't appear quite big enough to completely obscure the sun during a solar eclipse and an observer sees a ring of brilliant light around the moon			1
this is called an annular eclipse			0
at perigee ( as now ) the sun will be completely blocked by the moon during totality			1
this gives scientists a chance to study the sun 's atmosphere and help solve a cosmic conundrum			2
astronomer @entity98 of the @entity63 's @entity99 explained that the sun 's atmosphere or corona is a massive 2 million degrees @entity103 but the sun 's surface only around 5,500 celsius			2
he said this temperature difference has long mystified scientists			0
" the eclipse at totality allows us to see the inner most regions of the sun 's atmosphere even if it 's only for a few minutes -- it 's very hard to do otherwise , " he said			2
perhaps the brief window will give solar experts a chance to collect more data			0
but you do n't have to be an astronomer to appreciate the incredible spectacle of an eclipse			0
@entity2 would like to see your pictures and videos and hear of your experiences by using @entity2 's eclipse @entity125 assignment -- but please take care			0
never look directly at the sun -- it is dangerous and can cause permanent damage to your eyes			0
regular sunglasses are not safe either			0
ahead of last year 's eclipse in the @entity136 , @entity134 advised @entity2 readers : " even at maximum eclipse , a sliver of sun peeking out from behind the moon can still cause pain and eye damage			1
direct viewing should only be attempted with the aid of a safe solar filter			0
" @entity134 suggested some old tricks for viewing indirectly , like punching a hole in cardboard and projecting the light seeping through it onto a surface away from the sun. you can find more safety advice on @entity134 's eclipse website			0
a total solar eclipse is a phenomenon that wo n't last forever			0
the moon is moving away from the @entity21 at a rate of about 3.8 centimeters ( about 1.5 inches ) every year			1
there will come a time when the moon will appear to be too small to cover the sun. but do n't worry , you still have to time to catch one -- @entity134 calculates this will take about 563 million years .			1

solar eclipses happen when the sun , moon and @entity21 are perfectly aligned so that when the moon passes in front of the sun it casts a shadow on the @entity21
on march 20 this year the moon 's shadow falls across parts of @entity49 , @entity50 and the @entity51
the moon is *slowly* moving away from the @entity21 so there will come a time when the moon will appear to be too small to cover the sun
