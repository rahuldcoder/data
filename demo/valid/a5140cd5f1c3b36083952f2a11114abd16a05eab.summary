@entity0 a supporter of suspended " @entity4 " host @entity3 delivered a petition with nearly 1 million signatures calling for his reinstatement to the @entity10 's headquarters in @entity0 on friday -- driving an armored tank up to the building			1
@entity3 was suspended for allegedly hitting a producer , the @entity10 reported last week , and " @entity4 " -- a highly popular show with a big global audience -- was not broadcast as scheduled sunday			1
the @entity10 's decision to take the show off the air pending an investigation has outraged many of @entity3 's die - hard fans			1
more than 990,000 of them have signed the petition posted on @entity24 by @entity25 , a right - wing political blogger , just a week ago			0
whether the show of support will have any impact on the @entity10 's response is unclear			1
@entity3 tweeted his thanks friday night to those who are calling for his reinstatement , saying he is " very touched			1
" the findings of the internal investigation are due to be presented to the corporation 's director general next week , the @entity10 said thursday			1
" once this has been considered , we will set out any further steps , " a statement said			0
the @entity10 said in an earlier statement that @entity3 , one of the corporation 's highest earners , had " a fracas with a @entity10 producer			1
" in an indication of its popularity , " @entity4 " was named as the world 's most widely watched factual program in the @entity50 2013 edition book , with an estimated 350 million global viewers			1
the show is sold to 214 territories worldwide			0
@entity3 vented his apparent frustration in an expletive - filled speech thursday night in what seemed to be a spontaneous appearance at a charity auction in north @entity0			2
a @entity1 reporter who was at the event heard @entity3 swear liberally as he talked about his suspension from the show , saying the @entity10 " have f * * * * * themselves " and that it had ruined a great show			1
@entity3 also auctioned what he said would be one final lap of the " @entity4 " track in @entity69 , outside @entity0 -- used in the show for putting vehicles through their paces -- for Â£ 100,000 ( $ 148,000			1
) it 's not clear whether he had the authority to offer the use of the track for auction -- but his words seem to suggest he does n't expect his @entity10 career to continue , even if no decision is expected before next week			2
" i did n't foresee my sacking , but i would like to do one last lap , " @entity3 said			2
" so i 'll go down to @entity69 , and i 'll do one last lap of that track before the f * * * * * * b * * * * * * * sack me			0
" whoever placed the winning bid would be able to ride in a car with him on that lap , he said , or in a rare @entity90 supercar owned by a friend			0
@entity3 , who 's been presenting the show since the late 1980s , added , " i 'll be a bit tearful when i do it			2
" the controversial star has at least one influential ally -- @entity98 prime minister @entity97			0
" i do n't know exactly what happened , " @entity97 told the @entity10 last week			0
" he 's a constituent of mine , a friend of mine			0
he 's a huge talent			0
" because he is such a huge talent and he amuses and entertains so many people , including my children , who 'd be heartbroken if ' @entity4 ' was taken off air , i hope this can be sorted out , because it 's a great program and he 's a great talent			2
" opinion : why we crave the abuse of @entity3 it is not the first time that @entity3 has been at the center of controversy			0
last may , the television star asked for forgiveness after using a racist term during a taping of the show			0
@entity3 had mumbled the n - word while reciting a children 's nursery rhyme , but that version of the take was never aired			2
last year , the @entity10 show hit the headlines when @entity132 complained about a " @entity4 " special filmed in the country in which the number plate @entity135 was used -- interpreted by some as a reference to the 1982 @entity138			1
forced to stop filming and leave the country , @entity3 said on the @entity142 website that the use of the plate was purely coincidental in a previous article on its website , the @entity10 said " @entity3 is not a man given to considered opinion			1
