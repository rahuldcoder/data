a gloved hand reaches for a scantily - clad backside			2
it could be an image from the hit television series " @entity9 , " which documented the ribald world of advertising in 1960s @entity8			0
except this is 2015 and " who squeezes them in @entity21 ? " is the poster strapline for the elite @entity13 competition in @entity14 , accompanied by that gloved cyclist 's hand poised to pinch a woman 's bottom			1
unlike the wind provocatively lifting up her skirt , the controversial advertisement was n't dreamed up out of thin air			0
it 's inspired by previous winner @entity29 @entity28 , who pinched a podium girl 's behind at the @entity32 -- something he later apologized for , saying " i promise to act more respectfully in the future			1
" a week earlier , he was also pictured on the @entity13 podium , making an ass - grabbing motion towards another flower girl			1
@entity13 's organizers chose to celebrate his antics in their 2015 campaign , sparking a global debate about sexism in cycling that has raced far beyond the billboard			1
" @entity46 " " a guy grabbing a woman 's ass is very much indicative of a level of sexual assault , " said @entity47 , former professional cyclist and director of " @entity49 , " a documentary about female racers			1
" this poster makes cycling look very outdated			1
they 're relying on a ' good old boys club ' tactic to help them sell a product -- and in this case that product is racing			0
" judging by @entity68 's provocative standards , the poster could even appear tame compared to previous years			1
in 2011 organizers opted for a naked woman lying in a field , while the silhouettes of miniature riders traversed her bare backside			0
more baffling was last year 's poster featuring a woman straddling three other females curled into the shape of a bike			1
" such provocative imagery may have been seen by some in the 1950s and 1960s as a basis for selling products , but marketing communications are a rather more sophisticated and progressive activity than they were 50 years ago , " said @entity81 , professor of sport business strategy and marketing at @entity83			0
" i think @entity13 are rather out of kilter with the way that most people think today			0
" " a playful nod " cycling 's world governing body , the @entity94 ( @entity94 ) has since requested the poster be removed , to which the @entity13 organisers have agreed -- not that they necessarily see it as offensive themselves			1
" personally , no i do n't think it 's sexist , " @entity102 , @entity68 manager , told @entity1			1
could he see why others might find it offensive ? " i do n't know			0
you have a lot of publicity where you see more than some underwear , " he said			0
" and we did n't mean it as sexist			0
" the organization has since withdrawn the poster , releasing an official apology to " anyone who might find it intimidating , discriminatory or sexist			1
" " the organization launched this campaign as a playful nod to the stage incident two years ago in which a rider got ready to squeeze the buttocks of a flower girl , " it added			2
removing the poster is one thing -- but the @entity94 missed an opportunity to make an example of a tournament which has used seemingly sexist campaigns for years , said @entity133 road race champion , @entity134			1
" telling the race organizers to remove the posters is not much of a deterrent , " added the retired cyclist whose autobiography " @entity137 " highlighted sexism within the sport during her over decade long career			2
" a whopping fine and canceling the race would have sent out the strong message that there is no place for sexism in cycling			1
instead , the race has received huge publicity			0
" celebrating sexual assault ? the poster also glorifies what would be seen as sexual assault in any other workplace , said @entity158 , founder of the " @entity159			2
" " it contains a direct reference to an incident of sexual assault , which should n't be treated as something to celebrate and joke about , " she added			0
similarly , @entity14 's @entity164 , said the image violated 2007 anti-discrimination legislation and " incited sexual intimidation			1
" it 's unlikely the same image would have been used in a female tournament			1
" not only is the poster sexist -- this race does n't even have a women 's field , " said @entity47 , who has long campaigned for a women 's edition of the @entity176 equal to the men 's -- a race often seen as the ultimate prize in cycling			1
" here we are , fighting these battles to make equality happen			0
and posters like this are not helping to pave the way for cycling , " she said			2
she sees the problem not with the majority of " supportive " male cyclists , but with the lack of female representation among race directors and promoters			0
money talks indeed , sponsorship is a big factor is getting a race like the women 's @entity176 off the ground , said @entity199 , one of two females on the board of @entity202			2
" a lot of it comes down to whether something has a market value -- and it 's not necessarily down to gender , " she said			2
" we 've introduced a women 's tour in @entity211 and we have got financial support for that			2
but you ca n't just jump to mass spectators and mass broadcasting because these things grow incrementally			0
" former @entity218 champion @entity134 points to the discrepancy in prize money as another big obstacle for women within the sport			0
" the inspiration for the poster is the @entity32 , for which male winner @entity226 received € 20,000 ( $ 22,000 ) for his efforts			2
in comparison , when i won this event , i was happy for the team to split the modest € 1,000 i received amongst the other riders , " she said			0
" the biggest change i would recommend to provide protection , security and credibility for female road riders , would be the introduction of a minimum wage , as there is in place for male riders , " added @entity134			0
" @entity202 can not be allowed to exist outside the laws of society , like some sort of medieval anarchy			0
" it seems that rather than a podium girl 's bottom , the one being put under the spotlight at this year 's event , will be the organizers themselves .			1
