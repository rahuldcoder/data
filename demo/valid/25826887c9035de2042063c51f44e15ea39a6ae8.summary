@entity1 , @entity2 at 74 years old , @entity0 still remembers the first time she rode a bike			1
" my father let go of my seat , and there i was on my own , " she said			2
years later , @entity0 realized the power of biking to change lives			1
during a 1982 mountain biking trip in northern @entity2 , @entity0 reached a point on the trail where she could see all of @entity14			1
looking out at the city , she thought of the children she met while volunteering at a soup kitchen there			1
and it hit her : she wanted to give them the same experience			1
" there 's nothing like biking up a mountain and looking behind you to see all you 've accomplished , " she said			2
@entity0 has since helped more than 25,000 at - risk children from the @entity27 get off urban streets and into nature through her nonprofit , @entity30			1
do you know a hero ? nominations are open for @entity34 2015 in addition to mountain bike excursions , the group provides bike mechanic training and the chance for young people to earn credit toward their own bikes			1
today , @entity30 has expanded to 90 chapters around the world , serving more than 15,000 children each year			1
see more @entity34 @entity3 's @entity46 spoke with @entity0 about the impact of her efforts			1
below is an edited version of their conversation			2
@entity3 : for many of the young people in your program , this is their first time on a mountain bike			2
how do they react ? @entity0 : many of them have never really left the city			1
to them , life is automobiles and buildings			2
but you bring them where there are no buildings , no cars , it is like , " wow ! i did n't know that this exists			2
" i think we 're planting a seed that there are alternatives to getting into trouble			0
they can get on a bike and go to a place that is very much unlike where they live and do something positive			0
it 's giving them the notion that there is something else			0
@entity3 : and their experience goes beyond bike trips			1
what else do you offer ? price : the second is our @entity98 , where kids in the community come after school			1
they learn bike mechanics , and while they 're participating they are earning credit			0
they can use it to buy bikes or parts			2
they 're buying bikes for themselves , for their parents or siblings			2
i just love the idea of having them work toward a goal			0
they 're really learning skills that will help them in the future			0
the third ( program ) is our bike thrift shop , where anyone in the community can come shop for a discounted bike			0
we call it trips for @entity132			0
all of the bikes and bike gear are donated			2
it provides 60 % of what we need to run our programs			0
and it is 100 % an environmental program			0
we follow the three ' @entity140 ' very rigorously : reduce , reuse and then recycle ! @entity3 : @entity30 has grown well beyond @entity14			1
why do you think this model works so well ? price : it 's easy to use the bike to introduce kids to the environment because the bike is universally loved by children			1
the bike allows us to introduce them to a healthy lifestyle and good work habits			0
( it 's ) a tool to impart these life lessons			0
right now there are 90 chapters , literally around the world , that are repeating our experiences			1
they all do bike rides and then some of them , as they get more developed like we did , also start their own @entity167 programs or their own bike thrift shops to support themselves			0
@entity3 : did you ever imagine your simple idea would have such an impact ? price : i wear my @entity30 t - shirt wherever i go			1
i went into the bank one day here in @entity177 , and there was a young girl who was the teller			0
she looked at my t - shirt , and she said , " wow -- you 're with @entity30 ? that was the best experience i 've ever had			1
i will never forget it			0
" i do n't know how many stories there are like that , but it 's planting that seed			0
i just love every minute of it			0
seeing the results of what we were accomplishing just had me stick with it			0
since i started the notion , i have n't given up and hope to continue forever			0
