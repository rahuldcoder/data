i 've dressed up in the same type of costume on @entity4 for years -- always a superhero			2
not one character in particular			2
" just any excuse to put on a wig and a cape , " i 'd tell friends			1
last year , i found a more specific persona			2
see , this @entity4 was different : i 'd been diagnosed with a brain tumor just weeks before , and donning this costume was a lighthearted way to feel empowered ahead of the biggest fight of my life			1
it was saturday , october 25 , 2014 -- earlier than usual for me to think about a costume for my favorite holiday			2
but this year , i would n't be able to party on the same day as everyone else			1
i was organizing one last massive celebration to honor my life and the people i love before my brain surgery two days later			1
it all started early one morning in september while i was wrapping up my work as a digital producer for @entity1 's " @entity29			1
" as i was typing at the computer , letters were dropping off the right side of the screen			2
i started to feel strange and went to the nurse 's office in my building to ask for help			1
my speech began to slur , my hands were tingling , and my head was pounding			1
i also forgot my co-workers ' and bosses ' names			0
the nurse thought i could be having a stroke and called an ambulance			0
within an hour , i went from thinking i might have a migraine because i needed new glasses to being rushed to the hospital			1
i was 28 years old			1
they stripped off my clothes in the emergency room to hook me up to the machines that would reveal i was n't having a stroke			0
great news ! but then , what was going on ? first person : shopping for a new coat unleashes old memories after an mri , we had the beginning of an answer			0
when i looked at the scan of my brain , sitting there , big as an orange , in the left hemisphere was a large black spot			1
my speech came back fully after a few hours , but a terrible headache lingered all day , and i was kept in the hospital overnight without discussing with the medical staff the full details of what was found on the scan			1
my family and i were scheduled to meet with a brain surgeon the next morning			1
about 6 a.m. , i was asleep when a resident came into my room and woke me up			0
he wanted to talk about my case , he said			0
" my parents are coming later , and we 're meeting with the doctor , " i told this stranger			0
" ms. @entity87 , we suspect you have a meningioma			1
" he could have been speaking @entity91			0
" we see you have a brain tumor , and you 'll have to have surgery to have it removed , " he said in a calm , even tone			1
i do n't remember what i asked him after that , but once he left , i felt hopeless and alone			0
tears poured out of my eyes , and i sucked in air when i ran out of breath			0
it was the most afraid i 've ever been in my life			1
when my parents arrived , we met with the surgeon , who offered more clarity			0
he suspected that the tumor was slowly growing deep in the left ventricle of my brain for years			1
and the incident at work ? perhaps a miniseizure related to the tumor , but they could n't be sure			1
i was told the mass was n't life - threatening at that point and probably was not cancer , but the location was very deep and unique			1
the tumor was growing in an open tunnel in my brain and would eventually grow big enough to block the flow of spinal fluid			1
@entity124 was recommended sooner rather than later			0
first person : caught in grief 's riptide after my terrible experience earlier in the day with the resident who loved to share bad news and disappear , i knew i did n't want to have my surgery at this hospital			1
it was time to shop around for a brain surgeon			1
two weeks after the incident at work , i saw a doctor at @entity138 who talked about the surgery in dire terms			1
there was a 10 % chance i would need a shunt to help drain excess fluid from my brain for the rest of my life			1
unsatisfied with that option , i kept browsing			0
wonderful colleagues and friends within the @entity152 helped me find dr. @entity153 at @entity154			0
dr. @entity153 is a tall , commanding man with the confidence and swagger you 'd hope for in a brain surgeon			1
somehow , his description of the seven - hour procedure and what would come later did n't seem as scary as before			0
we booked the date for the surgery at the end of october			2
" this is just like a pebble in my brain , " i told friends			2
" they 'll get it out , and i can move on with my life			2
" two days before the operation , my friends and family gathered at a bar in @entity177 for that pre-halloween , prebirthday , presurgery party			0
i wore a short blue wig with my @entity12 outfit and set up a photo area to document everyone 's costumes			0
we all laughed and danced for hours , and at the end of the party , whoever was left did the @entity189			0
we ran in and out of a circle , joyfully raising our hands in the air			0
ghosts and pumpkins mingled with birthday decor			0
although i was born at the end of november , i wanted to cover all my holidays since i had no idea what the future would hold			0
first person : the only @entity202 i 've ever known what if they took the tumor out and it was cancer after all ? what if they could n't get the whole thing during the operation and had to do radiation later ? what about that shunt ? what if @entity213 went wrong and i would never be myself again ? at the hospital , my family bickered about who got a chair in the waiting room as i sat silently , waiting to be whisked through the double doors and into the rest of my life			1
once i was on the operating table with the iv in , the anesthesiologist started the magic medicine , and i barely started to count before i was knocked out			0
i woke up one brain tumor lighter and surrounded by the people i love			1
i spent five days in the hospital , mostly sleeping from the antiseizure medicine			2
friends and co-workers came to the hospital to tell me stories about their holiday adventures and share pictures of their nights			2
if i was ever lonely or uncertain about my place in the world before , having this experience was a relatively quick way to discover that i have tremendous love and support in my life			2
my recovery has taken a lot of hard work			2
i went straight from the hospital to inpatient rehab to weekly outpatient care , working on speech , occupational therapy and memory recall			2
i did so well there , i was named february 's " @entity255			0
" when my doctor recently told me i 've had the best recovery she 's ever seen over her 20 - year career , i burst into tears of joy			0
the experience has given me confidence in my resilience and more perspective than before on the importance of living in the present , because things could always be worse -- completely out of nowhere and totally unexpectedly			0
that fact was solidified when just a month after my surgery , my best friend 's sister died from a brain aneurysm			1
@entity274 's guilt overwhelmed me , but so did a sense of gratitude			0
i do n't have an answer as to why i 'm ok and my friend is gone , but i know it makes me push harder as i sweat through spin class and linger longer while i stare at sunsets and beautiful views			0
my zest for life itself -- the good and bad -- is so much stronger than before			2
i returned to work part - time , working one day a week starting in february			1
i 'm at two days a week now and hope to be back producing digital content full - time for " @entity29 " by may			2
though i 'm now at the edge of 30 with a new identity as a survivor , i do n't consider myself a superhero			0
at least not until next @entity4 .			0
