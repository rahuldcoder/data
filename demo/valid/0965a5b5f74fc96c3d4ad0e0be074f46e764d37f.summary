for decades , no one has been able to convict millionaire @entity2			1
not after his wife 's disappearance			1
not after his friend 's suspicious death			2
not even after he admitted he killed and dismembered his neighbor			1
but it may be @entity2 who does himself in with 11 words he muttered in a restroom : " what the hell did i do ? killed them all , of course			1
" those comments were picked up on a microphone he was wearing for the @entity18 documentary series about him called " @entity19			1
" apparently , the real estate heir did n't turn his microphone off when he went to the bathroom			1
@entity2 now sits in a @entity24 jail after his arrest saturday in connection with the 2000 death of his longtime friend @entity28 in @entity29			1
on monday , @entity31 prosecutors said @entity2 was " lying in wait " when he shot and killed @entity28 because she " was a witness to a crime			1
" she had been shot in the head shortly before investigators were supposed to come ask her about the disappearance of @entity2 's first wife in 1982			1
@entity2 will be transferred to @entity29 to face a first - degree murder charge			1
if convicted , he could face the death penalty			2
when he goes to trial , could those 11 words be admitted in court ? here , several legal experts weigh in : yes : his lawyer could argue that he absolutely did			1
" here 's what his attorneys are going to say : they are going to say that he had an expectation of privacy , " @entity51 legal analyst @entity50 said			1
" and as a result of that , putting this in context , he excused himself and went into a private bathroom			2
" no : that argument might not fly , @entity1 legal analyst @entity61 said			2
" that whole theory of the @entity64 is that you have an expectation of privacy under certain circumstances when you 're dealing with the police			2
but here , he 's dealing with filmmakers			0
" furthermore , @entity61 said , @entity2 had a microphone on			1
" you ca n't have an expectation of privacy when you 're wearing a microphone			2
yeah , he maybe forgot , but that 's not good enough			0
" yes : the defense very well could , said @entity50 , the @entity51 analyst			0
" the attorneys are going to further argue that there was governmental action in as much as @entity18 was working very closely with the authorities			0
and they 're going to say , is n't it coincidental how his arrest comes on the heels of the final episode of this @entity18 documentary ? " no : @entity1 legal analyst @entity87 does n't think that defense will work			2
" in criminal law , the police ca n't wire somebody up			0
they have to give you @entity95 warnings if they 're going to take a statement from you , " he said			0
" however , if a civilian is tape - recording you , as was the case here with @entity18 , that 's admissible in court if it 's relevant to the crime committed			2
" yes : he could			0
@entity104 was the judge during @entity2 's 2003 murder trial in which he admitted to shooting an elderly neighbor and then dismembering him			1
she remembers how prosecutors did n't use many of his admissions			0
" in our trial , he had been recorded on the phone talking to his wife and friends , making a lot of admissions , and the state never used that , " she said			0
" but he was aware that he had been recorded saying things that could implicate him in the murder that we were trying			0
" no : probably not			0
@entity121 of the @entity122 says " evidence of a statement is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule when offered against the declarant in an action to which he is a party in either his individual or representative capacity			0
" in this case , @entity2 is the declarant who spoke those words , and if they 're used against him , they could be fair game			1
yes : it 's a card the defense could certainly play			0
" it will be up to ( defense attorney ) @entity144 to talk about , and i think he 's going to have a field day with the idea that it was n't an answer in response to a question , ( so ) that 's meaningless , " @entity1 legal analyst @entity141 said			2
already , one of @entity2 's attorneys has said not to read too much into his client 's offhand remarks			1
" your honesty would lead you to say you 've said things under your breath before that you probably did n't mean , " attorney @entity155 told @entity161 ' " justice with judge @entity160			0
" " we want to contest the basis for his arrest , because i think it 's not based on facts , it 's based on ratings , " @entity144 told reporters tuesday in @entity24			0
" so we will continue to fight for @entity170			0
we want to get to @entity31 as quickly as we can so we can get into a court of law and try this case where it needs to be tried			2
" no : the prosecution could argue @entity2 knew what was going on			1
" earlier in those interviews , in a previous interview for that very program , there was a break where he was caught practicing his testimony			0
and so he realized ... he had a mic on , " said @entity183 , the judge from @entity2 's earlier trial			1
" this is a third time he 's made that mistake			0
" @entity1 's @entity190 contributed to this report .			0

real estate heir @entity2 has been investigated in two deaths and a disappearance
a microphone catches @entity2 saying he " killed them all "
legal experts debate whether that audio can be used against him in court
