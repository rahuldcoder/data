back in 2010 @entity2 's politicians broke new ground			1
they were long used to haranguing each other in the @entity2 's rowdy @entity5 -- but they 'd never had @entity8 style pre-election head - to - head debates			1
it is necessary and long - established political fare in the @entity8 -- but over here in the @entity2 , it was novel			1
it seemed to go well -- political points were scored , and polls were commissioned looking for advantages gained or lost			0
it was a drama of sorts , even though no knock - out punches were landed			0
prime minister @entity20 and his conservative party won the election , but not by enough to go into government alone			0
for the past five years he 's been governing in coalition with the @entity2 's third party , the @entity25			2
and their leader , deputy prime minister @entity26 , has mostly backed @entity20 in @entity29 debates against the opposition @entity31 leader @entity30			0
@entity2 's broadcasters , keen to channel lively politics onto prime time tv and boost ratings , have been working the corridors of power themselves over the past year to try to nail down a repeat -- or two -- of the 2010 knockabout			1
what 's at stake is n't just the proposed debates ahead of may 's general election -- but the enshrining of such debates permanently into @entity2 's political architecture -- just like in the @entity8 but while @entity20 and @entity30 have hired former @entity48 election advisers to edge them in to the lead , no one can agree on what form a debate should take , how many there should be , or even who should be invited			1
@entity20 has insisted on just one debate involving the leaders of seven leading @entity2 parties -- giving equal airtime to the @entity58 , the @entity59 and the upstart rightwing @entity2 @entity61 ( @entity62 ) , among others			1
but @entity30 's @entity31 is holding out for at least one head - to - head debate with @entity20			1
no one seems to be budging but both of the @entity2 's largest parties could use the bump in the polls such a debate might bring			2
part of the problem is the @entity2 electorate , which has changed since 2010 , boosting the fortunes of some of the country 's former political outliers			2
the rightwing @entity62 , which has pledged to take the @entity2 out of the @entity78 , has made massive gains in the past year -- mostly at the expense of @entity20 's conservatives			2
in @entity83 , the september independence referendum ( which narrowly failed ) so reinvigorated the @entity84 that they could hit what is usually a key @entity31 stronghold , undermining @entity30 's bid for power			0
all of this has made the whole process of nailing down precisely who will be allowed in the debate that much more tortuous			0
for the big leaders who drive that conversation , it is about how each outlier can help them -- and hinder their rivals			0
it once looked like it would become as much of a @entity2 institution as rain , or fish and chips , but now the election debate seems in danger of not happening at all			1
on the upside , you can still tune in to @entity106 most days of the week to get your fix of one lawmaker bellowing at another			0
but do it soon -- i hear that even those everyday raucous exchanges are being scrutinized for being a bit old - fashioned .			0

election tv debates only arrived in the @entity2 in 2010
broadcasters are keen to repeat the head - to - head format in the run - up to the 2015 poll
but *factional* politics and arguments about who is invited may derail a tv debate
