@entity2 , @entity3 co-pilot @entity1 's voice is n't heard in a recording of the final moments of @entity7 9525			1
but investigators say he was the one at the controls inside the cockpit , deliberately locking out the plane 's captain and setting the plane on a crash course for the @entity15			1
@entity1 had medical note for day of crash , hid illness , officials say the only sound the recorder picked up from @entity1 as the @entity23 went down , @entity21 prosecutor @entity20 said , was the co-pilot 's steady breathing			1
authorities did n't mince words thursday as they blamed @entity1 for the crash , but questions are still swirling over the 27 - year - old 's past			1
officials say @entity1 passed a psychological test when he was hired , had no known ties to terrorism and showed no sign of medical distress during the flight			1
it seems , @entity20 said , that @entity1 " wanted to destroy the aircraft			1
" but why ? @entity42 ceo ' speechless ' it 's a question police were trying to answer as they searched @entity1 's apartment in @entity46			1
@entity48 spokesman @entity47 said a team of five investigators went " through the apartment looking for clues as to what the co-pilot 's motivation might have been , if he did indeed bring the plane down			1
" about 85 miles ( 136 km ) away in the town of @entity2 , the house where @entity1 's parents live was shuttered and guarded by police			1
a group of men , perhaps investigators , were the only ones granted access			2
this town in western @entity3 is where @entity1 pursued his love of flying from a young age			1
at a club on the outskirts of @entity2 , pilots who knew @entity1 said they were shocked to hear what investigators said			1
they said the man they know never would have deliberately crashed a plane			1
between the ages of 14 and 20 , @entity1 was a regular fixture at the gliding club			1
" ( he was ) a very normal young person , full of energy , " @entity81 said			1
" what can i say ? he had a bright future			0
he made his hobby into his job			0
what more can you hope to achieve ? " the authorities ' explanation does n't ring true for @entity91 , another pilot who knew him from the flight club			2
" knowing @entity96 , this is just inconceivable for me , " @entity91 told the @entity95 news agency			0
" he was a lot of fun , even though he was perhaps sometimes a bit quiet , " @entity91 said			0
" he was just another boy , like so many others here			0
" a neighbor told @entity95 that @entity1 " was very interested in things which are going on around him			2
" " it 's a very good family , " the neighbor said			2
" they have a good connection within the family and they are engaged in the community			0
" an 8 - minute descent to death @entity1 had been with @entity7 , a budget airline owned by @entity42 , since september 2013 and had completed 630 hours of flight time , the airline 's media office said			1
@entity42 ceo @entity116 told reporters that @entity1 " interrupted " his training , which he began in 2008			2
that break lasted several months , he said , but added that such an interruption is n't uncommon			0
@entity116 said he could n't give any information about why the co-pilot had stopped and then restarted his training			2
if it was for medical reasons , he said , then that information would have been private before the crash , he said , but it will be part of information gathered during the investigation			0
most of @entity1 's training took place at the @entity42 flight training center in @entity132			1
he also trained in the @entity134 , spending six months at facility in @entity136 as part of a required program to get his license , a @entity42 spokesperson said			0
@entity116 said @entity42 pilots get medical testing but do not undergo regular or routine psychological testing once they are flying			0
however , the airline does consider an applicant 's psychological state , along with other factors , when hiring pilots , he said			2
@entity1 and the captain passed a psychological test when they were hired , he said			2
" we do n't only look at competence but we also give a lot of room to psychological capabilities , " @entity116 said			0
" he was 100 % set to fly without restrictions , " he added			0
" his flight performance was perfect			0
there was nothing to worry about			0
" students , singers among the victims 5 cases of pilots intentionally crashing @entity164 reported from @entity2			0
