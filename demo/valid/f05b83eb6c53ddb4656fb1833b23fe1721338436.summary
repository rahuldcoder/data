@entity0 , the @entity3 - based @entity2 terror group , has pledged allegiance to @entity5 , according to an audio message purported to be from @entity0 's leader , @entity7			1
in the audio , which was posted online saturday , the speaker says @entity0 is announcing its " allegiance to the @entity11 of the @entity12 , @entity13 , " which is another name for @entity5 leader @entity15			1
@entity1 has not been able to independently authenticate the message			0
but @entity17 , an expert on the terror group and is with the @entity19 , said the recording appeared to be authentic			0
he said that while other messages have been faked , the speaker in this one is @entity7			0
" @entity0 joining the @entity5 fold makes sense to both groups , " he said from @entity24 , @entity3			1
" @entity0 will get legitimacy , which will help its recruiting , funding and logistics as it expands into ( @entity33 - speaking ) @entity32			1
it will also get guidance from @entity5 in media warfare and propaganda			1
previously @entity0 was a sort of outcast in the global @entity40 community			2
now it is perhaps @entity5 's biggest affiliate			2
" @entity5 gets more international legitimacy as a global caliphate			1
" @entity17 said the allegiance will be official when an @entity5 leader such as spokesman @entity47 issues a statement			1
@entity0 has had two main factions -- one led by @entity7 and the other comprising former members of @entity52 , a @entity0 offshoot			2
@entity52 had been operating from around 2012 as the @entity3 wing of @entity55 ( @entity55 )			0
after the @entity33 - led intervention in @entity59 in 2013 , a significant number of @entity52 members re-integrated with @entity7 , @entity17 told @entity1			0
the prerequisite for @entity0 joining @entity5 coalition was a coming together of two factions			1
@entity5 connected with former @entity52 fighters within @entity0 and pressed them to further unify the group 's ranks			1
the result was the formation of a unity general command between the two factions			0
that involved bridging of some ideological differences between the @entity55 - like @entity52 and the ultra extreme " takfiri " - like @entity7			0
the pledge follows a period during which @entity7 's faction had been mimicking @entity5 , including praising @entity76 and featuring his image in their videos and photos			1
@entity17 said that until recently there had been little feedback from @entity5 , apart from a few references to @entity3 jihadis in recent issues of the @entity87 - language @entity86 magazine			2
it appears that a month ago @entity5 set up a @entity90 account on which saturday 's message was linked , @entity17 said			1
the @entity90 handle was mutually promoted by @entity0 and @entity5			1
in july , @entity7 voiced support for @entity5 , and declared a overtaken town in northeast @entity3 to be part of an @entity12 caliphate			2
but he also said he was praying for @entity55 leader @entity97 and @entity99 leader @entity98			0
@entity101 intelligence officials have some doubts the two groups would get along			1
the @entity105 's analysis has been that @entity0 is very @entity106 and rooted in that region 's @entity12 practices , even if they have similar fundamentalist interpretations of @entity12			2
and @entity5 's @entity112 leadership and membership tends to have racist attitudes toward blacks , not unlike the society they come from			2
@entity5 leaders view @entity7 as inferior , partly for racist reasons , the @entity105 indicated at a briefing for reporters			0
@entity0 , whose name translates as " @entity129 education is sin , " has been waging a yearslong campaign of terror aimed at instituting its extreme version of @entity127 law			0
@entity0 's tactics have intensified in recent years , from battling @entity3 government soldiers to acts disproportionately affecting civilians -- such as raids on villages , mass kidnappings , assassinations , market bombings and attacks on churches and unaffiliated mosques			0
much of this violence has taken place in @entity3			0
but neighboring countries , such as @entity146 and @entity147 , have also been hit increasingly hard			0
@entity1 's @entity148 and @entity149 contributed to this story .			0

audio message was released online saturday and speaker is said to be @entity0 leader
expert says **partners*hip* will have *benefits* for both groups , including giving @entity5 international legitimacy
but @entity101 intelligence officials have indicated their doubts they groups would work well as *partners*
