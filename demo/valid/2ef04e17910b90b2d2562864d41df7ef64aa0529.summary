there is always champagne at these things , but this art opening is an actual party			0
purple light bounces off the white walls in the massive foyer of @entity9 's @entity8 ; punk music falls down the stairs and @entity13 's homo - erotic biker short @entity14 is playing on a tv screen			2
@entity16 is here , and so are @entity17 and @entity18			0
there are the requisite grey ladies in fur and chapeaux , as well as twenty - somethings in backpacks huddled in groups , downing their drinks before walking into @entity28 's booze - free exhibition space for the opening of @entity30 , @entity31 of incense : a portrait of @entity34			1
while his name may ring few bells outside of the seasoned @entity9 art community , eminent gallerist @entity34 , who ran a gallery in @entity9 during the @entity36 and again in the @entity37 , was a seminal part of the @entity36 scene			1
his notoriety hinged on scandal , parties and friendships with the most famous rock stars of the era , as well as an undeniable talent for spotting art 's @entity50			0
this is the eminent dealer who sold art to @entity55 , and hosted @entity56 and @entity58 's first joint exhibition ; the @entity61 whose @entity60 galleries attracted the likes of @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 in the 60s and 80s ; the silver - tongued heroin addict who introduced @entity69 and @entity70 to @entity71 , and was arrested -- and , in his case , imprisoned -- for drug possession with @entity74 and @entity75 during the 1967 @entity76			1
curated by the artist @entity77 , a strong , @entity78 -- a winking reference to the police report describing the bust -- aims to blend the rebel , the art connoisseur and the hedonist to present a rounded image of an unsung star of the 60s			1
" there are oceans of anecdotes by @entity34 , and some of them are true			2
but the anecdote is n't enough to convey the kind of energy that he had , this kind of magnetic energy that drew you to him -- or repelled you depending on your own energy , " says @entity77 , arguably the world 's most well known stained glass artist			2
i first met @entity77 three weeks before the opening at his spacious cottage - cum - mansion in @entity9 's tony @entity105 neighborhood			1
a literal portrait of @entity34 painted by @entity70 hangs prominently in the living room , surrounded by works by @entity69 , @entity109 and others			1
@entity77 , who was a close friend of @entity34 's and was the first artist exhibited at his 80s gallery , is still finalizing the exhibition selection , but his energy is easy , if a little manic			1
@entity115 , a long - time friend of @entity77 and @entity34 , and author of the @entity34 biography @entity118 : the @entity119 of @entity34 , has been collaborating with him on the catalog			1
she 's on hand to add her own anecdotes to the ocean			0
" i remember going to @entity125 , ( @entity126 and @entity128 's 70s punk shop ) on the @entity129 , and it felt a bit scary , but that was part of the thrill , " she says			0
" and that 's what people often felt about going to the @entity34 gallery in both incarnations			2
" the idea for the portrait came from @entity28 's managing director @entity141 a year ago , when @entity77 told her he 'd been entrusted with @entity34 's archive			1
( @entity34 died of @entity144 - related illness in 1986 at the age of 49			2
) " the ' light bulb moment ' really struck when we realized that @entity28 founder , @entity149 , was setting up his first gallery in @entity151 at the time @entity34 was opening his own gallery in @entity9 , " @entity141 writes in an email			1
" we 're exploring our own dna with this exhibition while paying tribute to one of the most flamboyant dealers and aesthetes			2
" there 's a buzz in @entity9 right now around the exhibition and many artists , museum directors , celebrities , aspiring artists , art students are all very keen to rediscover @entity34 's personality			1
" to hear @entity77 speak about @entity34 is to have assumptions alternately challenged , rebuked and confirmed			1
he makes no excuses and offers no explanations for @entity34 's " more hedonistic side , " but emphasizes his generally quiet demeanor and modesty			2
the overall impression is of someone with an acute eye for talent ( he showed @entity109 , @entity69 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182 ) and a rebellious , destructive streak			0
this is reflected in the exhibition itself , which is set up like an archive			0
works from the luminaries @entity34 knew , showed or admired are on the walls , while personal effects -- a thank - you note from @entity192 , a @entity194 poster , arrest warrants , an opium pipe with the gold rim worn to silver -- are kept behind glass cases			1
in one corner , there 's a recreation of his desk			0
take a few steps , and you 're looking at the drum from @entity209 ' 1967 @entity208 album cover , which @entity34 art directed			1
other elements reflect their personal relationship			0
a @entity213 that recalls a joint trip to @entity216 to see his works in person			0
an inscribed copy of an @entity221 biography was gifted from @entity34 to @entity77			1
there was more to @entity34 , it seems , than the people he associated with			2
" there is always around @entity34 this aura of all these celebrities and things like that , and it 's true that they were there , but it was n't anything that he either curried or boasted about , " @entity77 says			1
" he was not a respecter of persons			0
he liked people or he hated them			0
" he was often reluctant to discuss his connections and friendships , even with those close to him			0
@entity77 remembers discussing @entity240 with @entity34 at length during a stay in @entity243			1
he did n't realize the two were friends until @entity240 came over to their table a few nights later to hug @entity34			2
similarly , @entity115 remembers @entity247 , @entity248 's 1978 biography of playwright @entity249 , without once mentioning that he was an early backer of @entity249 's productions			0
( she would discover this while researching @entity118			0
) " for all of the inevitable references to the hedonistic side of @entity34 , he had a very sophisticated intelligence in terms of visual art , and genuinely in terms of culture , " @entity77 says			1
" so whilst he was not inclined to talk culture , he was eminently capable of it			0
a party - goer and i get to chatting about the exhibition , the party , and @entity34			1
she enjoyed the party , but did n't -- does n't -- know much about @entity34 the man			2
" the exhibition is so chaotic and eclectic , " she says			0
" maybe that was him as a person ? " around 9:00 pm , security guards are shepherding the reluctant crowd out of the building , into the cold night			0
on the steps , a particularly drunk kid tries and fails to goad someone into a fight , while the less inclined start hailing cabs and mapping how to move the night into @entity283			0
i recall something @entity77 told me a few weeks prior , an effort to summarize the spirit of @entity34 's galleries and its infamous parties , studded with stars and doused in glamor and excitement			1
" when you were with @entity34 , you felt there was nowhere really much better to be			0
you knew that you would not have more fun anywhere else , that 's for sure , and you would not be more stimulated , " he 'd said with a kind of wistfulness			0
" it was brief and short - lived , but that light burned bright			0
" a strong , @entity31 of incense : a portrait of @entity34 is on at @entity9 , @entity304 until march 28 , 2015 .			1

a strong , @entity31 of incense : a portrait of @entity34 pays tribute to the top @entity9 art dealer
the @entity313 exhibition , curated by @entity77 , features artists represented , admired or known to @entity34
@entity34 was best known for being arrested with @entity74 and @entity75 for drug possession in 1967
