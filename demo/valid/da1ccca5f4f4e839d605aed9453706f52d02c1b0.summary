on friday , @entity0 claimed responsibility for @entity4 's deadliest terror attack			1
a day earlier it claimed responsibility for the worst terror attack in @entity7			0
last week it welcomed into the fold @entity10 , a @entity12 terrorist group with thousands of fanatical fighters that dominates territory the size of @entity16			0
all this came in the wake of the group 's rapid expansion across @entity21 , its assimilation of a powerful @entity24 terrorist group , and the founding of small chapters in @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 , where its new affiliate last year beheaded a @entity33 hiker			0
the group 's momentum may have stalled in @entity36 and @entity37 , but its supporters from the @entity39 to the @entity40 appear to be heeding its leader @entity42 's call to " erupt volcanoes of jihad			1
" by far the most surprising development was its claim of responsibility for the twin suicide bomb blasts that killed over 130 in @entity50 mosques in @entity51 , @entity4 , on friday and another attack in the north			1
@entity0 was only thought to have a fledgling presence in @entity4 and had only claimed one previous attack , the assassination of a @entity4 security official north of @entity58 earlier this month			1
@entity59 in @entity4 , or @entity60 , has for years been the dominant @entity62 group inside @entity4 , but it denied involvement in the mosque attacks , saying it was against its principles to target mosques , bolstering the @entity0 claim			1
this indicates @entity0 has very quickly built up an operational capability inside @entity4 in the months since jihadis inside the country released an audiotape declaring allegiance to @entity74 last november			1
only two developments could explain this : defections from @entity60 or the return home of @entity4 @entity0 veterans skilled in urban warfare and explosives			1
there is no love lost these days between the two groups			0
since @entity74 declared @entity0 had expanded into @entity4 late last year there has been an escalating war of words between them , with @entity0 claiming @entity60 was not doing enough to target @entity88 and @entity60 declaring that the @entity0 caliphate was illegitimate			1
while @entity60 has acknowledged previous internal disagreements about whether to support @entity0 , there have been relatively few defections			1
its charismatic leader , @entity93 , @entity59 's global number two , is extremely popular among the group 's rank and file			1
in recent months the group has reaped a recruitment windfall from @entity101 tribal anger over the @entity50 takeover of @entity51 , allowing it to expand its operations across @entity4			1
but @entity0 appears now to have laid down the gauntlet , declaring its attacks friday were the " tip of the iceberg			1
" in targeting the @entity50 mosques in @entity51 , @entity0 would be quite deliberately repeating the sectarian strategy of its founder , @entity110 , who launched a devastating suicide bombing on @entity113 in @entity114 in february 2006 , which plunged @entity37 into a full - blown sectarian civil war			1
@entity110 correctly calculated that the @entity50 , infuriated by the attack on their most sacred shrines , would violently retaliate , driving @entity101 into the embrace of the jihadis			0
@entity4 appears now to be on the brink of a similar civil war			1
the terrorist attack on the @entity123 in @entity7 on wednesday that killed 23 was the worst terrorist attack on tourists in the @entity126 world since the 1997 massacre in @entity128 , @entity24			0
it would also be @entity0 ' most spectacular act of international terrorism since it carried out coordinated suicide bombings on @entity135 and international hotels in @entity136 , @entity137 , in 2005			1
but @entity7 is right on @entity139 's doorstep , just 30 miles across the sea from the southern @entity142 island of @entity143			0
@entity0 has so far offered no proof to back up its claim it was responsible			1
yet several factors give the claim credence			0
firstly , as of late friday no other group had claimed responsibility			0
secondly , @entity7 investigators have established that two members of the cell that carried out the attack trained in the @entity157 and @entity158 region of @entity21 late last year			0
in november , @entity1 reported that @entity0 was running several training camps in the @entity160 between these two eastern @entity21 towns where it was instructing recruits from across @entity164 , including @entity7			1
thirdly , up to 3,000 @entity7 have traveled to @entity36 and @entity37 , many to fight with @entity0			1
five - hundred are believed to have returned home , including a significant number of trained killers , skilled in handling automatic weapons			0
the three most powerful new @entity0 affiliates are in @entity24 , @entity21 and @entity12			1
last november the @entity24 @entity172 - based jihadi group @entity171 pledged allegiance to @entity0			1
bolstered by the return home from @entity36 of @entity24 @entity0 veterans , in recent months the group has escalated its campaign of attacks against security forces in the @entity172 and across @entity24 and has put out its own gory beheading videos			1
the threat it poses to @entity185 tourists was underlined last summer when it killed an @entity135 oil worker in the deserts southwest of @entity188 in a carjacking			0
in @entity21 , @entity0 is taking advantage of chaos and simmering civil war to rapidly expand			1
last autumn it established a foothold in eastern @entity21 , bolstered by the return of 300 @entity21 @entity0 veterans and the arrival of a top deputy of @entity199			2
it is now the dominant force in @entity157 , has a presence in @entity158 and controls part of the town center in @entity205 , on whose beaches it beheaded more than a dozen @entity24 christians in february			0
it also has a growing presence in @entity212 , where its fighters in january carried out an attack on the five - star corinthia hotel that killed several @entity216			0
in @entity12 , @entity10 pledged allegiance to @entity0 earlier this month and brought celebrations to the streets of @entity220 , @entity0 ' headquarters town in @entity36			2
@entity10 hopes it will bring a recruitment , fundraising and propaganda windfall			0
" the merger with the @entity232 was a strategic , calculated , and long - term decision coming from the top of the @entity10 leadership and communications structure , " wrote @entity224 , an expert on the group , in a just released @entity228 @entity227 study on @entity0 ' growing array of affiliates			2
though military operations by @entity12 and @entity239 have eroded @entity10 's safe haven in northeastern @entity12 in recent weeks , the group still has formidable capacity to terrorize the region			0
a signature tactic : beheading its enemies with chain saws			0
for reasons of geography , there appear to be fewer organizational ties between @entity0 and @entity10 than between @entity0 and its affiliates in @entity21 and @entity24			2
" the numbers of @entity10 fighters who have fought or trained with @entity0 in places such as @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity255 , and @entity21 and returned to @entity12 is believed to be small : fewer than 20 fighters and video - propagandists , " @entity224 , who was recently briefed by @entity12 intelligence officials , told @entity1			2
@entity0 ' expansion into the southern shore of the @entity261 has alarmed @entity139 governments			2
@entity142 fishermen operating off the south coast of @entity142 are so concerned they could be targeted by @entity0 gunmen launching from @entity21 in speedboats that they have demanded protection from the @entity142 navy			2
then there is the threat of trained @entity139 fighters returning home from the killing fields of @entity37 and @entity36			0
over 3,000 @entity139 have traveled to fight in @entity36 and @entity37 , many with @entity0			2
more than 750 have returned			0
among their number , according to @entity276 counterterrorism officials , was a @entity276 terrorist cell dispatched by @entity0 from @entity36 to carry out a major terrorist attack in the heart of @entity139			2
the plot was thwarted when several of the cell were killed in a gunbattle in eastern @entity276 in january			0
@entity139 officials told @entity0 is increasingly pivoting toward plotting attacks in @entity139			2
there is also concern @entity0 could infiltrate @entity289 passport holders into @entity139			2
last year more than a hundred - thousand refugees arrived in @entity142 from @entity21 , according to the @entity291			0
@entity33 prime minister @entity292 warned thursday that @entity139 faced the greatest terrorist threat in its history , the starkest warning yet from a head of a @entity139 government since @entity0 set up its caliphate in @entity36 and @entity37			0
" the problem is not if there will be another attempted attack in @entity33 and in @entity139 , but to know when and where , " he said .			0

@entity0 was only thought to have a fledgling presence in @entity4 , but claims responsibility for bombing there
@entity0 supporters appear to be heeding its leader @entity42 's call to " erupt volcanoes of jihad "
