says there 's been a 35 % rise in fans reporting abusive behavior committed by other fans -- and that 's largely due to a new phone app. " the app has had a massive impact , " @entity8 media and communications manager @entity16 told @entity1 , noting that it accounted for 27 % of all complaints			1
" self - policing is so important when it comes to stamping out racism in football			1
people are confident that their complaints will be taken seriously			2
" the 184 reported incidents recorded during the last five months of 2014 covered racial and religious discrimination , as well as sexual orientation , gender and disability offenses			2
the increase was measured against the same period the year before			0
@entity8 's mobile phone application , which was released in 2013 , encourages fans to report incidents anonymously by pressing a " report it ! " tab and entering the name of the football ground , positioning of the offender , and incident details			1
although contact details of the person reporting the incident are requested , @entity8 emphasized that the anonymity of the tool is key			0
every single objection logged by fans , either on the phone , via email , or on the app , triggers an investigation by the @entity52 ( @entity52 )			1
these include 73 incidents on social media ( a 24 % increase ) , which have so far led to 21 instances of the offender being identified , and at times having their accounts deleted			0
the @entity52 , which released its own witness complaint guidelines in 2013 , encouraged fans to be proactive in flagging up incidents			1
" reporting abuse , whether witnessed or experienced , is an important part of the game 's overall anti-discrimination work , " said an @entity52 spokesperson			1
" there are clear ways for players and fans to do this , and these improved procedures should result in more reports in the future			0
" @entity16 admitted that it takes " bravery and courage " for fans to record photographic evidence on their phones , but pointed to the effect @entity86 expatriate @entity85 has had after he filmed @entity88 fans physically stopping a black man from getting on the @entity91 metro last month			0
the amateur video obtained by @entity94 newspaper , and posted on its website , shows the man make multiple attempts to board a train at @entity100 station , only to be pushed away each time by a group of passengers			0

five people have been identified and suspended by @entity88 , who have launched an ongoing investigation			0

" would we know that these @entity91 and @entity128 incidents had happened if they were n't on video ? " @entity16 asks , adding that @entity8 is considering an option to upload video and still images of offenders directly to a complaint log on the app. " if you have video footage and you can issue that retrospectively , it can make it easier to identify the perpetrators , " he says			0
in a report released in 2013 entitled " @entity143 and @entity144 " , the @entity52 explicitly talks about " raising confidence in the reporting and disciplinary process at grassroots level			2
" @entity8 's jurisdiction extends to all of @entity151 football , including the amateur ranks			1
it is one of the few independent bodies in world sports which solicits complaints from fans in order to weed out abusive behavior			2
it also polices the actions of players , which has embroiled the organization in controversy of its own in the past			0
in 2012 , @entity168 refused to wear a @entity8 t - shirt before a match while playing for @entity171			0
he was protesting a perceived lack of response by the governing bodies against @entity175 after the @entity88 defender was accused of racially abusing his brother , @entity177 of @entity178			0
