during the three years that i was serving as a member of @entity3 's @entity2 , i would frequently walk to work through the gate of the @entity6 so i could get a glimpse of the mosaics , and perhaps enjoy the adjoining herb garden			1
the museum , in downtown @entity10 , serves not only as a physical reminder of @entity3 's @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity17 heritage , but is also connected to the @entity3 parliament			1
i used to love these peaceful moments on the way to work			0
sadly , they will likely never feel quite the same again			0
on wednesday , that kind of mood was shattered as the museum came under siege			0
more than two dozen people were killed as gunmen armed with @entity28 opened fire , sending men , women and children scrambling through the @entity33 to escape			1
the members of parliament who were evacuated were , ironically , discussing an anti-terror bill in a committee			0
two of the attackers -- who were killed during the assault -- have been identified , and the security minister on friday indicated the pair had been activated from a sleeper cell , although at the time of writing authorities had yet to announce a link to a specific jihadist group			2
however , the attack followed the release of videos purportedly from the @entity51 threatening @entity3			1
meanwhile , individuals associated with the banned @entity3 organization @entity53 declared allegiance to @entity51 leader @entity55			1
all this has left some wondering if the museum attack marks a shift in strategy for @entity51			2
have @entity61 terrorists moved beyond their usual guerrilla - style operations to suicidal attacks outside @entity65 and @entity66 ? if they have , then our political leaders -- who have already been vocal about their commitment to combating terrorism , and have been collaborating with @entity71 to prevent @entity3 entering @entity66 -- will need to redouble their efforts			1
the threat posed by terrorism to @entity3 citizens and our guests ca n't be downplayed , much less ignored			1
however , the reality is that a comprehensive strategy is still wanting , a point made in a recent report published by the @entity81 , @entity3 's foremost think tank on political , economic and environmental matters			1
indeed , the institute , which has tracked the upsurge in @entity61 jihadi recruitment in @entity3 based on fieldwork and interviews with @entity3 jihadists , has documented how the phenomenon has largely unfolded outside the media 's view			1
so , how should we respond ? some mps have demanded the immediate passage of a new anti-terror law , and have been dismissive of the need to focus on human rights at a time of crisis			0
however , wednesday 's attack does n't change the fact that we already have an anti-terror law that applies ; simply passing a new version of a law will not stop a repeat			2
instead , @entity3 should build on the stable institutions we have in place to implement some of the key ideas contained in the institute 's report			2
for example , rather than rely exclusively on the @entity3 security apparatus for short - term gain , we need to better engage the @entity3 public in our common struggle against @entity61 terrorists			2
part of this means beating the terrorists at the recruitment game			0
tunisians yearn for a sense that the state recognizes their humanity , dignity and value as individuals , not just as potential voters and taxpayers			0
with this in mind , it is clear that the @entity3 state has done a poor job of " recruiting " its citizens into the fold , which has left space for terrorists to make a pitch for young @entity3 who feel alienated and who have lost hope			1
of course , a robust police response is required to contain @entity61 jihadism			0
but this must be matched by an equivalent civil response to uproot the problem			0
that is why as law enforcement fans out across the country to investigate and protect , i hope also to see educators and trained social workers traveling to rural and impoverished areas of @entity3 to demonstrate that the state has recovered the kind of humanity that was lost during decades of police - state , authoritarian stagnation			2
wednesday 's attack was tragic			0
but to move forward , we must not be tempted to fall back on our past .			0

at least *23* people were killed in an attack on @entity6 in @entity10
@entity168 : @entity3 has *failed* to " recruit " its citizens into society
