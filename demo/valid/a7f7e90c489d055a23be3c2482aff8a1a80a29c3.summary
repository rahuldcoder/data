@entity2 @entity0 has ordered a stay of execution of a man who was convicted of manslaughter while he was 14 years old			1
@entity7 , 24 , was scheduled to be hanged on thursday , but a government official confirmed wednesday night with a tweet that @entity7 will not be hanged and that his case will be reviewed for another 72 hours			1
" we are still unclear on what investigation can be done in 72 hours , " said @entity11 , @entity7 's lawyer			1
" we will be coordinating with the government and are happy to provide any documentation they would need			0
" @entity7 's case has triggered outrage from human rights campaigners , who complain he did not get a fair trial and had confessed to murder after being severely tortured by the police			1
his family says @entity7 , at the age of 14 was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for kidnapping and killing a child while he was employed as a security guard in 2004			1
unable to afford legal counsel the state appointed him a defense lawyer , whom , according to human rights groups , failed to provide any evidence or claim that @entity7 was a juvenile			2
this meant @entity7 was tried as an adult in an anti-terrorism court			2
a social media campaign with the hashtag @entity38 trended in @entity0 and a small protest was held in the capital to raise awareness about his case			2
@entity7 was calm when he thought he was going to be executed , @entity45 , his brother told @entity1			2
" he had said that if i do n't get justice in this world , i will get it in my afterlife			0
" " i ca n't tell you what kind of night my family has had			0
i close my eyes and i want to forget			0
i ca n't express the agony we have gone through , waiting and not knowing			0
" @entity7 was initially due to be hanged on january 19 , but under international pressure , @entity0 's interior minister @entity55 called for a stay order			1
addressing parliament , the minister called for an investigation into the young man 's age			2
two months later , another death warrant was issued for @entity7 , with an execution date set for march 19			1
since then @entity7 's lawyers handed in a plea of clemency to the president 's office with documentation that the inmate was a minor at the time of his arrest			1
attention to his case comes in the wake of an announcement by @entity0 that it would lift its moratorium on the death penalty for all cases -- not just for those tried in anti-terrorism courts			2
@entity0 lifted the death penalty moratorium for terrorism cases following the attack on an @entity87 in @entity88 , which left at least 145 teachers and students dead			0
it was the deadliest act of terror in the country 's history			0
the decision to lift the moratorium on all cases affects more than 8,000 prisoners currently on death row , the largest number in the world			0
the lifting of the moratorium has caused an uproar of criticism by human rights groups in @entity0 and abroad			0
" it 's like responding to a blood bath by indulging in blood lust themselves , " @entity106 , the chairperson of the @entity107 of @entity0 told @entity1			1
" executions on this scale tend to brutalize society			0
" earlier this week the @entity115 released a statement on its website calling @entity0 to " reinstitute the moratorium and to respect fully all its international obligations , in particular the principle of fair trial			0
" the statement also said that @entity0 is a party to an international covenant " that specifically prohibits the use of the death sentence for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age			1
