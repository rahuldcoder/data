admit it , you 've been secretly itching for a new cause since last year 's @entity4 for @entity5 left your teeth chattering and raised $ 115 million			1
this one 's goofier and tastier , and wo n't leave you needing a change of clothes			1
it 's the # @entity11			1
so what 's this challenge all about ? think of the spaghetti scene from " @entity15 , " except substitute a @entity16 for the noodle			1
chomp and chomp and chomp until your lips meet in the middle , then smooch			2
you 're supposed to do a video , of course , and challenge others to do the same for a good cause			2
the ball got rolling almost two weeks ago on @entity31 's " @entity28 , " a fundraiser for autism programs			2
a tweet from sportscaster @entity33 challenged the " today " show 's @entity35 and @entity36 , who plays @entity38 " @entity39 on " @entity37 , " to share a " @entity15 " licorice			1
it took off from there			0
next thing you knew , @entity35 was repeating the stunt with @entity46 and the # @entity11 was on			1
@entity35 and @entity46 challenged @entity47 and @entity48			0
they were good sports about it , but you may want to close your eyes here			0
this is n't for the faint of heart			0
the challenge is starting to invade social media			0
just search the hashtag # @entity11			1
it sounds like a sweet deal for the folks at @entity16			0
their candy is on the lips of @entity64			0
and to their credit , a couple of @entity16 executives took the challenge and donated $ 10,000			2
the money goes to @entity70			0
the group funds and creates schools , programs and services for people with autism nationwide			0
since 2006 , " @entity28 " has raised over $ 22 million			1
if this challenge is even half as successful as the @entity4 , that number will triple			1
see you at the candy counter .			0

the # @entity11 is *inspired* by " @entity15 "
last year 's @entity4 raised $ 115 million
