his satire took @entity3 , and the world , by storm			1
but now , @entity6 -- @entity3 's most famous satirist known as his country 's @entity8 -- has the public profile of a politician in retirement , leading study groups at the @entity14			1
" well , you know , sometimes circumstances are not the best for you to continue a political satire show , " @entity6 told @entity2 's @entity15 in an interview that aired monday			1
" sometimes jokes kind of are annoying			0
" his show -- literally called " @entity24 , " or " @entity25 " -- ran for three seasons during @entity3 's turbulent and utterly confusing @entity27 days			1
@entity6 's biting satire left nothing unscathed -- whether the president , political and militant @entity31 , or the military			1
" there is room for satire and comedy as long as it 's acceptable by the people controlling the atmosphere			1
" his incredible story from cardiac surgeon to satirist to political target is the subject of a documentary currently in production , directed by a senior producer for @entity8 , with whom @entity6 developed a close relationship			1
" it 's talking about political satire , humor , how ( people can ) be all for a certain program or a joke , but when the joke turns on them , they kind of like turn on you , " he said			1
" and so maybe we were an equal opportunity satirist , but they were not ( an ) equal opportunity audience			0
" the chances are small that his show would be allowed back on air , if he even wanted to do so -- " the question is will i be allowed to do , make fun of whatever ( i want ) ? " ( " who said that my country 's authoritarian ? come on , " he joked			2
" i mean , do n't put words in my mouth			0
we are -- it 's a very , very good , democratic country ; please , please			2
" ) but he is far from idle , seemingly casting around for ways to occupy his immense talent			0
at @entity14 , he is a visiting fellow working on " political satire and humor , and how they interact with political , social and even religious taboos			1
" he is careful not to say he is teaching , as " @entity14 professors are very touchy when resident fellows come here and say they teach			2
" he is also writing a script for a movie comedy , and building a platform to identify talent in the @entity84 world and allow more people to experience the extreme and unexpected success he did			2
" satire did n't begin or end with my program			2
i mean , it is a part of people 's culture , a part of people 's thoughts			2
so if one program is off , there are people who will find other ways			0
" his program showed the @entity84 world in a new light for many in the @entity102 , and he said he hopes more will follow in his footsteps			0
it 's a counterbalance , if you will , to the messianic image propagated by @entity107			0
" i do n't want to even call them extreme @entity31			0
i think they are a bunch of lunatics , who instead of playing ' @entity112 ' on video games , they want to do it in real life			0
" it may not often reach a @entity118 audience , but @entity6 said that @entity119 is filled with @entity84 making fun of @entity107 -- for example , setting the group 's favorite " anthems " to images of belly dancers			1
" it happens with all religions ... , " he said			0
" so they are crazy , and they are a threat for me as much they are a threat to you			0
" despite all @entity6 's projects , many simply want him to return to the airwaves			1
is he eyeing , @entity15 asked , the seat that will soon be vacated by his mentor , @entity8 ? " the day that i actually have been chosen to replace @entity8 will be like -- it will be glorious , " he said			2
" but i do n't think that @entity140 would like to take their political satire from a @entity143 guy with a thick accent			1
i think this is going to be even more difficult than electing a black president			0
" but you know , let 's hope			0

@entity6 is a visiting fellow at @entity14 working on " political satire and humor "
