last summer , amid startling news reports of manipulation , mismanagement and possibly death caused by failures at the @entity7 , @entity0 came together and passed legislation to overhaul veterans ' access to health care			1
i was proud to sponsor the @entity13 of 2014 ( the @entity14 ) , and deliver good news to veterans : they would have a choice when it comes to accessing health care they deserve , and many would have the option of seeing their local physician			0
now , the @entity7 is trying to take the choice away			1
a mere six months after the @entity14 was signed into law , and only three months after veterans began to receive their @entity30 , the president 's budget attempts to reallocate the law 's emergency funds that are solely meant to pay for veterans ' health care in their communities			1
the @entity7 says these funds are n't being used quickly enough because veterans are n't interested in getting care from their local physicians			2
that could not be further from the truth			0
thousands of veterans are struggling to access the care they were promised through the @entity14 because of the @entity7 's flawed implementation of the law and foolish interpretation of the 40 - mile rule in the distance criteria			1
when @entity0 passed the @entity14 , the intent was that veterans be allowed to access local health care if they can not receive the @entity7 care they need within 40 miles of their home , or their wait time for an appointment is more than 30 days			1
unfortunately , the @entity7 decided to narrow the interpretation of the 40 - mile rule , choosing to take into account only the distance of a @entity7 medical facility from a veteran 's home and not whether the @entity7 facility can actually provide the services the veteran needs			1
veterans are being told they can not use their choice cards because they live within 40 miles of a @entity7 facility , even though that facility does not offer the care they require			2
the @entity7 is denying the access the law was intended to provide and forcing veterans to choose between traveling hours to a @entity7 medical facility , paying out of pocket or going without care altogether			1
veterans simply want what they were promised in the @entity14 : the choice to access the care they deserve in their community			0
in my hometown of @entity85 , @entity86 , a veteran is forced to drive 200 miles several times a month for routine cortisone shots because the @entity7 outpatient clinic just 25 miles from his home does not offer the shots he needs			2
one would think this veteran could use his @entity93 to visit a local physician or local hospital to get the shots he needs -- but the @entity7 is denying access to this care			1
thousands of veterans across the country are facing this same frustration			0
why is common sense not prevailing at the @entity7 ? why is the @entity7 not bending over backward to take care of veterans ? as a member of the @entity106 , i have questioned va secretary @entity107 and other @entity7 officials for months in hearings , personal meetings , phone calls and correspondence about the @entity7 's flawed interpretation of the 40 - mile rule and what can be done to fix the problem			2
@entity0 specifically included language in the @entity14 that gives the @entity7 the authority and flexibility it needs to provide veterans with access to care outside the va when the care needed by a veteran is " either unavailable or not cost - effective to provide at a @entity7 facility			1
" but for some reason , the @entity7 refuses to use the authority @entity0 gave it and put the best interest of veterans first			0
in the absence of @entity7 action , i authored legislation that would make certain veterans are not dismissed or forgotten just because of where they live			0
the @entity13 to @entity134 of 2015 ( @entity135 207 ) would require the @entity7 to utilize its authorities , including the @entity14 , to offer community care to veterans who are currently unable to receive the health care services they need from a @entity7 medical facility within 40 miles of where they live			0
this legislation enjoys broad bipartisan support in @entity0 and has been endorsed by numerous veterans ' organizations , including the @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 and the @entity151			0
when @entity0 passed the @entity14 , we called on the @entity7 to live up to its commitment to care for those who have sacrificed for our country -- and we will not back down			0
we ought to always err on the side of what is best for the veteran , not what is best for the @entity7 .			0
