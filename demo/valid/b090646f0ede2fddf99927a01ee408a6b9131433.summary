scientists have raised concerns about a large , rapidly thinning glacier in @entity4 , warning it could contribute significantly to rising sea levels			1
they say they 've discovered two openings that could channel warm seawater to the base of the huge @entity10 and bring the threat of potentially disastrous melting			1
the glacier is bigger and thinning faster than all the others in @entity4			1
it contains enough ice to raise the global sea level by at least 11 feet ( 3.4 meters ) , according to researchers from the @entity19 who were among the authors of a new study published this week in the journal @entity24			2
scientists had previously detected warm water on the seaward side of the glacier			1
but until now , they had found no evidence that it could threaten coastal ice			2
" we now know there are avenues for the warmest waters in @entity4 to access the most sensitive areas of @entity10 , " said @entity31 , a @entity19 ph.d. candidate and the lead author of the study			1
the two gateways on the seafloor that lead to the base of the glacier offer an explanation for why @entity10 has been melting so fast			1
scientists have already warned about the consequences of melting ice in @entity47			0
@entity48 said last year that glacial retreat in some areas " appears unstoppable			0
" the increase in sea levels that would be caused by the melting of all the ice in @entity10 is estimated to be roughly equivalent to the contribution from a collapse of the entire @entity57			1
the @entity60 ' report on climate change last year estimated sea levels could rise between 1 foot and 3 feet by 2100			0
such a rise could displace tens of millions of people from coastal areas around the world			0
but that calculation does n't factor in the latest research on @entity4			2
" while the @entity71 melt may take several centuries , once change has begun our analysis reveals it would likely be irreversible , " @entity31 said in comments cited by the @entity69			0
to prevent the process from becoming unstoppable , atmospheric and oceanic conditions would need to change so that snowfall outpaces coastal melting , the researchers said			0
the scientists gathered their data through a series of aerial surveys using technology that can scan the ice and seafloors in areas that are inaccessible to icebreakers			0
the team included researchers from the @entity92 , @entity93 and the @entity94 .			0
