astronauts on the @entity3 completed a spacewalk sunday despite the appearance of water inside an astronaut 's helmet , @entity0 reported			1
in a tweet , the space agency said astronaut @entity11 experienced water inside his helmet , just as he did wednesday , but " it 's a known issue ; no concern			1
" the spacewalk lasted five hours and 38 minutes , @entity0 said			2
" crews have now spent a total of 1,171 hours and 29 minutes conducting space station assembly and maintenance during 187 spacewalks , " the agency said in a release			1
@entity0 previously said the suit worn by @entity0 astronaut @entity11 has a history of " sublimator water carryover			1
" water in the sublimator cooling component can condense when the suit is repressurized after a spacewalk , causing a small amount of water to push into the helmet , @entity0 said			1
@entity0 said @entity3 managers had " a high degree of confidence " in the suit			0
on the upcoming spacewalk , @entity39 and @entity40 installed antennas to provide data to visiting vehicles and deploy 400 feet of cable along the edge of the station			0
@entity11 said he first noticed traces of fluid and dampness in his helmet wednesday while he was waiting for the crew lock cabin to repressurize			1
he and @entity40 had been outside the space station for nearly seven hours working on the station 's robotic arm and performing some maintenance			0
@entity39 immediately alerted fellow astronaut @entity57 about the water , and she alerted @entity59 in @entity60			2
@entity57 helped @entity39 out of his helmet and examined it			0
she confirmed the presence of moisture , mostly in the helmet absorption pad , or @entity65 , describing it as " wet and cold			0
" at the request of @entity59 , @entity66 used a syringe to draw as much water as he could from the top of the helmet			2
water had collected in the white plastic at the top and around both ear cups			0
@entity66 estimated there was 15 milliliters of water in the helmet			2
that 's a far cry from the amount of water that accumulated in @entity83 's suit during a spacewalk in july 2013			1
between 1 and 1.5 liters of water backed up in the suit and helmet , prompting fears @entity83 could drown in his own helmet			0
the spacewalk was cut short , and @entity0 implemented some changes to its suits , including the addition of absorbent padding in helmets			0
there was another intrusion of water into the helmet during another spacewalk on december 24 , 2013			1
@entity0 commentator @entity101 said it was noticed at the same point in the mission as wednesday 's leak -- during the repressurization of the crew lock , the area from which astronauts enter and exit @entity3 while in space .			0
