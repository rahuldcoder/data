a turning point came when @entity60 , the @entity35 ' all - star player and @entity0 's favorite basketballer , heard about what @entity0 was going through and paid him a visit in the hospital			1
@entity60 and @entity0 spent the next couple hours discussing each of their stories			1
the basketball player told him about growing up with pronated hips and having to wear leg braces , similar to the ones @entity0 was wearing at the time			1
he talked about what it took to be in the @entity73 : that many good ball players failed to embrace and work on what they were not good at , and personality and character weeded many good players out			2
