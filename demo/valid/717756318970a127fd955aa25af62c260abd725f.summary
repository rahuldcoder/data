@entity0 , @entity1 the @entity3 on a wintry morning in january made for an awe - inspiring interview setting			2
we traveled along narrow roads winding among snow - capped mountains , eventually arriving at @entity8 -- the @entity3 home to @entity10 and his wife , @entity11 , @entity11			1
i had pitched for interviews with the couple several times over the years and finally prince @entity10 accepted			1
i wanted to speak to them about their 10 years of marriage and their upcoming @entity19 tour			2
the couple 's first tour as newlyweds was also to the @entity19 , so it felt like an appropriate moment to take stock			1
when you reach the house , it strikes you as an idyllic royal hideaway			2
it has the sense of a castle but is welcoming like a farmhouse			2
it has a pinkish hue and green window frames that take in the stunning views			2
we went in the back entrance and were escorted through the house to the dining room at the front where we set things up			0
rarely have cameras been allowed in , and never to this part of the house			0
as we were getting ready , an aide announced someone wanted to say hello			0
the @entity11 appeared from around the corner , keen to welcome the crew			1
we spoke about what all brits talk about -- the weather			0
prince @entity10 opens up about love and life she is not what you might expect when you meet her			1
she 's more charismatic , which is something i hope comes across in the @entity2 special , " spotlight : @entity10 and @entity11			1
" unfortunately she had declined our request to be interviewed			1
she 's never done one and does n't plan to			0
she wants the limelight to be on her husband			0
the @entity11 had however allowed our cameras to get close enough to pick up sound during some of her public appearances			1
that would give viewers a greater sense of her character than they had had before			0
when prince @entity10 arrived , he also insisted on meeting the crew , which was great but was also eating into our interview time			1
in the end , we had the full 20 minutes as planned			0
you can make your own judgements of the tv special , but i think we did manage to give you a good sense of him			0
he was comfortable enough to be himself			0
he was the same person on camera as off			0
afterward , we walked through the house and into the garden for some additional shots			0
the @entity11 joined us on the way and was worried i would be cold without a coat , but the coat was inaccessible and i did n't want to hold things up			1
you ca n't tell an awful lot about someone by spending just a morning with them , particularly as a journalist , but my impression was that they are close , connected and have fun			1
i then left them to take a stroll on their own with the crew , who captured some shots that i think have a small place in royal history -- a glimpse of a couple enjoying each other 's company in their private wilderness , before he ascends to the throne .			2
