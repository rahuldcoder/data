@entity0 is back in the middle of an unfolding controversy			1
the revelation that as secretary of state she maintained a private email account , and that she had a private computer server in her @entity9 home , sent shock waves through the world of politics last week			1
questions arose about whether @entity14 conducted her official business on private email , possibly violating regulations that were written to ensure that the activities of government officials remain accessible to the public			1
republicans jumped on the story			2
" it makes you wonder , " said @entity23 , the chairman of the @entity24			2
" did she use the private emails so she could conduct diplomacy and fund - raising at the same time ? " even many democrats are worried about the implications of this recent story			2
their front - runner , their " inevitable " nominee for 2016 , now seems vulnerable			2
many in @entity37 are anticipating that the scandal is only getting started			2
this is not the first time that @entity0 has found herself in this situation			2
she has spent much of her political career battling scandals			2
when her husband , @entity14 , was president of the @entity45 , she was one of the first targets of the earliest investigations into the administration -- " @entity49 , " " file-gate " and the @entity51 affair			1
she stood by her husband 's side later in his presidency when @entity55 @entity21 moved to impeach him for having lied about his sexual relationship with @entity57 , a @entity55 intern			1
although @entity14 enjoyed a bit of a break when serving in the @entity61 , the controversies resumed once she became secretary of state under president @entity63			1
during her tenure , @entity21 became consumed with multiple investigations into her role in the tragic @entity68 attacks			0
although the investigations failed to find any evidence of wrongdoing , the issue became a rallying point for conservative activists and fund - raisers			0
some @entity21 now claim that the emails will provide the data that they have been looking for to prove what they were saying			0
but those observers who are predicting her demise should remember that @entity0 has proven to be remarkably resilient over the years			0
each time she or her family has been hit with a scandal , she has survived			0
she has proven to be an extraordinarily tough fighter who turns these challenges into opportunities to become stronger			0
as @entity88 , playing @entity0 on " @entity87 " said , " @entity89 try			0
... this is not how @entity0 goes down			0
" based on her history , what can we expect from the @entity14 scandal playbook ? attack the accuser and the investigative process : nobody has done this better than @entity0			1
when her husband first confronted charges about his affair , @entity14 famously went on television and spoke about a " right - wing conspiracy " that she claimed was driving the scandal			1
although the revelation that the affair did occur brought her family great embarrassment , her charge became part of a larger counterattack from the administration that proved to be extremely effective			0
the @entity113 zeroed in on the hyperpartisanship of some members of the @entity21 , such as house speaker @entity116 , claiming that the @entity21 in @entity117 were on a mission to pull off a political coup			0
she employed a similar strategy with the @entity68 investigations , arguing that the inquiry was more a political tool used to rally the base than a serious investigation			1
we are likely to hear similar arguments now , particularly since the email controversy has opened up right as the campaign season is taking off			2
as more republicans ca n't resist jumping on the issue , @entity14 will push back , focusing public attention less on the issue than on the idea that this is part of a political narrative to bring her down			1
stick it out : one thing that @entity0 and her husband understand well is that the news media love a good scandal feeding frenzy , but that soon enough reporters move on			2
the @entity45 public , which is now used to fast - paced and constantly changing news stories , will follow the coverage as it shifts to a new story even after weeks , or months , of attention on one single issue			0
remember the @entity151 crisis ? not many people do , though for a time it was all anyone was talking about			0
as @entity155 wrote in the @entity156 : " if there 's one thing we 've learned from past presidential campaigns , it 's that most supposed game - changers like this quickly fade from the memory of the political class , having never been noticed by most @entity45 in the first place			0
" when dealing with scandal , @entity0 and her husband have avoided taking any rash action , ignoring whispers about resignation or discussions about major apologies			2
instead they strike back against their opponents and wait out the news cycle until the frenzy dies down			0
people should not expect @entity14 to do anything drastic in the near future			1
her first move , via @entity180 , was to announce in straightforward fashion that she has asked the @entity182 to review and release some of the email as soon as possible			0
while some @entity184 are champing at the bit to use this opportunity to push other members of their party ( @entity190 ! ) into the political fray , @entity14 is not going to give them any space to do this			1
she will wait until reporters and @entity117 move in a different direction			0
rally the party base : if there is one thing that the @entity113 understand , it is that their party is desperate for a good fight			0
after years of dealing with congressional @entity21 and the hardball tactics of conservative activists , the @entity113 appreciate that members of their party are searching for leaders who will take on their opponents			0
@entity184 are tired of elected officials who roll over too easily when attacked by @entity21			1
this has been one of the major complaints from @entity184 about @entity63			1
even when many @entity184 were furious with the @entity55 following the @entity57 revelation , the @entity113 appealed to partisan instincts and rallied the troops to fight for them as a way to push back against the @entity21			1
by 1998 , they had transformed the issue from being about @entity14 and perjury to a struggle to protect the @entity184			1
@entity14 will do this again			1
democrats are feeling particularly vulnerable ever since former @entity224 gov. @entity223 entered the race , bringing star power to a @entity21 campaign that seemed filled with lightweights and flawed candidates			0
given that @entity184 feel the stakes are enormously high to keep control of the @entity55 so that the next president can protect @entity63 's programs from @entity24 attack , @entity14 will appeal to that instinct to carry her through			1
will it work ? that remains to be seen			0
it will depend on the scale and scope of the upcoming revelations and what her opponents decide to do with the material			0
but the @entity14 playbook is pretty clear and road - tested			1
if @entity14 's critics and opponents expect her to just roll over , they really have n't been studying their history .			1

@entity255 : the former secretary of state has decades of experience in managing controversy
he says @entity14 and her husband know how to turn controversy into a tool to *energize* @entity184
