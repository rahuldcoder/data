@entity1 's path to redemption took a mere 12 minutes			1
for that short period of time the @entity4 must have been panicking that his needless error had cost his @entity7 side a place in the last eight of the @entity10			1
his handball had gifted @entity14 leaders @entity12 a 2 - 1 aggregate advantage in extra time , but this was one tale that would be adorned with a @entity1 lining			1
seconds after being denied by a world class save from @entity21 , @entity1 looped a header into the net to send @entity7 through on away goals			1
not only did he save himself from a barrage of criticism , he also got colleague @entity28 out of jail too			2
the maverick @entity32 striker 's dismissal after 31 minutes made @entity7 's passage into the quarterfinals all the more remarkable , as it battled the best team in @entity36 with 10 men for an energy - sapping 90 minutes			1
@entity39 looked to have ended @entity7 's resistance with a 81st minute goal before former @entity12 defender @entity42 equalized with four minutes left			1
@entity43 converted from the spot in extra time after @entity1 's misdemeanor before the 30 - year - old popped up at the death to make amends and avenge @entity7 's defeat at the same stage by @entity12 last season			1
" we played a great game , " @entity42 told @entity52			0
" it was amazing tonight , the spirit , the players gave everything			0
when we lost @entity28 we said we had to keep it simple and keep the ball			2
" it 's amazing for the club and the city			0
we tried to win the game even with one less man			0
we have a long way to go to win the @entity10 and we keep our feet on the floor			2
" the first tie ended 1 - 1 in @entity70 three weeks ago but most of the headlines related to an ugly incident of racism on the city 's @entity75 system			0
a group of supporters , apparently @entity12 fans , were caught on camera appearing to prevent a black man from boarding a train before chanting : " we 're racist and that 's the way we like it			2
" the @entity84 's @entity83 announced on wednesday that it had summoned five men to appear in court later in march , while @entity12 has vowed to ban for life any of its fans that are found guilty			1
the club extended an invitation to the man who was the the subject of the abuse , known as @entity94 , but the 33 - year - old refused			0
the opening stages were tense and feisty , just as they were in the @entity98 capital during the first leg , but the match in @entity101 ignited after a flashpoint just past the half hour mark			2
@entity28 , so often the hero for @entity7 , turned villain after being dismissed for a forceful tackle on @entity12 's @entity4 playmaker @entity108			1
the home side surrounded referee @entity110 who duly produced a red card -- the fourth of the @entity32 's often controversial career in the @entity10			1
but replays suggested the 33 - year - old was perhaps unfortunate to see red , having tried to pull out of the tackle at the last second			0
despite having a man advantage , @entity12 struggled to create clear cut openings as @entity7 defended resolutely			1
@entity110 was in the spotlight again as the half came to a close -- a mazy run from striker @entity123 ended when he was felled by @entity7 's @entity125 forward @entity124			1
the referee took a long look at the incident but decided to wave play on , much to the chagrin of @entity12 's players and manager @entity131			2
@entity131 's travails continued after the break as the @entity134 toiled in its attempts to open up a determined @entity7 rearguard			2
a half chance for @entity39 came and went before the visitors came to the fore			0
@entity140 played in @entity141 , whose ball across the face of goal was begging to be tapped in , before the @entity125 had a chance to tilt the tie firmly in his side 's favor			1
played in on goal by @entity152 @entity151 , @entity124 rounded @entity12 goalkeeper @entity21 but could only glance a shot off the near post from a tight angle			1
@entity151 then got into the area after neat approach play and , though he got a powerful low shot away , @entity21 was equal to it and palmed it clear			0
@entity12 began to reassert its dominance as @entity7 tired			1
substitute @entity162 weaved into the area and was denied by a fine save at his near post by @entity165			0
from the resulting corner a miskick from @entity123 presented the ball at the feet of @entity36 defender @entity39 , who lashed home from 12 yards out			0
but @entity12 were unable to hold out			0
@entity42 , who won the @entity10 with @entity12 during a three - year stint at the club , had been booed throughout the game for a running battle with @entity123			1
and he rose highest to power a header into the net and make the tie level on aggregate with just four minutes remaining			0
@entity7 began the extra half hour in sluggish fashion and were punished when @entity1 needlessly handled a looping cross into the area as he went up to challenge substitute @entity182 for the ball			1
@entity184 international @entity43 duly tucked the penalty away , to restore @entity12 's lead and ensure the tie would not go to penalties			2
@entity21 was forced to make a world class save from @entity1 , as the @entity4 desperately tried to make amends for his handball			0
but despite that warning , @entity1 netted with a fine header from the very next corner , looping a brilliant header over the goalkeeper from 14 yards out			0
after the game @entity131 admitted @entity7 had " clearly " been the better side : " our performance was not good enough , " he told @entity52			2
" we had the game in our hands twice but i think @entity7 were stronger than us and coped better with the pressure of the game			0
" @entity204 champions @entity203 cemented its place in the last eight with a comprehensive 7 - 0 dismantling of @entity208			1
after a 0 - 0 draw in the first leg in @entity212 , @entity208 's task became an uphill one inside four minutes when @entity213 was dismissed for bringing down @entity214 inside the penalty area			1
@entity216 tucked home the resulting penalty , and @entity203 subsequently laid siege to @entity208 's goal			1
@entity221 nodded @entity223 's cross against the post before @entity226 's side doubled its advantage just after the half hour mark			2
defender @entity229 had the simple task of tapping home from point blank range after former @entity234 striker @entity221 's effort had been saved			0
@entity203 ran riot after the break , @entity238 international @entity237 grabbing the third with a fine low finish after a powerful run into the area			0
@entity216 grabbed a second moments later before @entity243 made it five with a thumping header			0
@entity221 finally got on the score sheet before @entity214 completed the rout .			0

@entity98 side @entity7 knock @entity12 out of the @entity10
a goal in extra time from @entity1 sends @entity98 champions through on away goals
@entity7 played 90 minutes with 10 men after @entity28 's first - half dismissal
@entity203 hammer @entity208 7 - 0 to book its place in the last eight
