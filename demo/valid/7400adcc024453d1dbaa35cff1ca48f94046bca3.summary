the tragic news that @entity2 was deliberately crashed into the @entity3 by a pilot deemed " 100 % fit to fly " challenges the common understanding of the phrase			1
@entity8 prosecutor @entity7 said co-pilot @entity10 apparently " wanted to destroy the aircraft , " taking advantage of the pilot leaving the cockpit and most likely refusing to open the cabin door after activating the plane 's descent			1
the ceo of @entity18 -- of which @entity2 is a subsidiary -- said @entity10 had been " fit to fly			1
" but for most of us , the prosecutor 's preliminary finding that the 28 - year - old @entity22 purposefully caused the deaths of 150 people on march 24 puts him squarely outside that term			1
in fact " fit to fly " does not mean the pilot 's psychological state has necessarily been assessed			1
@entity30 is a pilot and visiting fellow at @entity33 's @entity32 in southern @entity34			1
over the last few years the aviation industry has been considering the amount of time spent examining pilots ' skills compared to the time spent examining how they thought , @entity30 said			1
many organizations had begun assessing the safety of particular airlines when considering which carriers their members should fly on , he said			2
" it 's not uncommon for those corporations to have in their assessment matrix a look at pilot selection procedures , " @entity30 said			1
" increasingly we 're looking at their all - round personalities and ability to work in teams and what they 're like as people			0
" apart from ' do we want to ensure we have n't recruited somebody who might have some sort of mental disorder , ' there 's also a very good reason in a day - to - day way			2
you want to recruit somebody who works well in a team , " he said			0
" the airline industry is quite unique in the amount of trust and liability it places in the hands of a very small number of employees , " @entity30 said			2
" if you look at the value of the aircraft and the immeasurable value of the lives being flown in that aircraft , you come up to a huge number -- in the hundreds of millions , if not billions -- of dollars of risk associated with that asset			0
in effect , a medium to large sized company is being placed in the hands of a few employees			0
" it is important that these airlines take a great deal of care -- not just about whether that pilot can fly -- but how fit that person is to carry that sort of responsibility			2
" on thursday , @entity18 ceo @entity97 said the company 's pilots did not undergo regular or routine psychological testing once they were flying			1
but he said @entity18 did consider an applicant 's psychological state , along with other factors , when hiring pilots			1
" we do n't only look at competence , but we also give a lot of room to psychological capabilities , " @entity97 said			0
the pilot and co-pilot on @entity112 had passed the test the airline used to evaluate applicants , he said			2
but @entity30 said aviation regulations only required a physical and not a psychiatric medical examination , looking at a potential pilot 's fitness to fly in terms of factors such as heart attack risk			1
those being examined were legally required to declare any mental disorder , but there was no standard psych testing from a regulatory point of view , he said , with airlines and industry bodies failing to reach consensus on types of tests to be used			1
" the doctor is supposed to note any evident issues that he notices -- but what is he going to notice in half an hour 's medical ? the rest of it relies on your medical history and you being honest , " @entity30 said			1
the @entity142 told @entity1 that @entity144 scheduled airline pilots must renew medical certificates every year if they 're less than 40 years old and every six months if older			0
" pilots must complete an official @entity142 medical application form , and have a physical examination conducted by an @entity142 - designated @entity150 , " it said			0
" the @entity142 medical application form includes questions pertaining to the mental health of the pilot			0
the @entity150 can defer a pilot to the @entity142 @entity156 if he or she believes that additional psychological testing is indicated			2
all existing physical and psychological conditions and medications must be disclosed			0
" on its website , the @entity142 guidance for @entity162 states : " the @entity142 does not expect the examiner to perform a formal psychiatric examination			0
however , the examiner should form a general impression of the emotional stability and mental state of the applicant			0
" in terms of a pilot 's fitness to fly on a particular day , @entity30 said attempts by many companies and airlines to introduce random drug and alcohol testing had hit problems with unions			1
" when crew report for duty , they obviously are seen by other company personnel and they 're also supposed to stop someone who 's not fit for duty , " he said , adding that was not a particularly robust system			2
" it does rely on a professional crew member turning around and stopping the flight			0
" in the short term , the industry needed to be sensitive to the fact that the crash was " an incredibly tragic event , " @entity30 said			2
" we need to be conscious in short - term not to exacerbate stress of the families in the first days , " he said			0
" it is important as an industry to recognize the amount of trust that 's been put in our hands and ensure the system is robust enough to live up to that			0
" but managing an industry with global implications was complex , @entity30 said , pointing out that @entity10 was able to lock out the other pilot because of strengthened security measures introduced after the september 11 hijackings			1
" it 's horribly , tragically , ironic that an unintended consequence of trying to mitigate one risk has actually facilitated an equally horrendous act -- that would n't have been possible if we had n't done something to try to mitigate the other risk			0
" was 9/11 safety precaution a flaw ? @entity224 and @entity225 contributed to this report .			0

on thursday the @entity8 prosecutor said @entity2 's co-pilot deliberately crashed
@entity18 's ceo said co-pilot @entity10 had been " 100 % fit to fly "
aviation expert @entity30 says regulations do not require formal psych testing
