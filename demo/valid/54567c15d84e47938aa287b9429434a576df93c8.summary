legendary fashion designers @entity0 and @entity0 are in a public spat with pop music icon @entity4 over some eyebrow - raising comments the pair made about gay parenting			1
long against same - sex marriage , the @entity9 designers -- who are not only openly gay , but were once a couple -- took their counterintuitive rhetoric to the next level this weekend when @entity0 said in an interview : " you are born to a mother and a father -- or at least that 's how it should be			2
i call children of chemistry , synthetic children			2
rented uterus , semen chosen from a catalog			2
" @entity4 , who along with his husband @entity27 is raising two children that were conceived through @entity30 , took to @entity31 to essentially say " oh no he did n't , " followed by " @entity33 " because nothing expresses anger quite like a hashtag			1
not to be outdone , the pair responded with # @entity38			2
so what should we make of all this boycott talk ? combined , the three men are worth an estimated $ 3 billion			1
the openly gay @entity43 , who is raising two boys via a surrogate mother , sided with @entity4 ( but he 's only worth an estimated $ 60 million , so i 'm not sure if anyone noticed )			1
regardless , while i find the archaic thinking of @entity0 disappointing , the truth is my budget boycotted their clothing years ago			2
some of it 's really nice			2
but i just ca n't afford to spend $ 500 on a t - shirt			1
and even if i could , i do n't know how i would justify doing so with a kid to put through college			0
that 's why i find this whole ultra rich on ultra rich violence so disconnected from the reality most of us on @entity31 are living			0
boycott ? besides the 1 % , who the hell is buying @entity0 regularly enough to actually call the act of not buying their clothing a " boycott " ? that 's a little like me saying i 'm upset with the way @entity71 is running the @entity72 so i refuse to play for him			1
even misguided consumers wallowing in debt and living way above their means likely do not have enough credit cards to keep up with the purchasing power of the @entity79 of this world			0
( no lie -- the online store has a pair of " @entity84 " for $ 795			0
and you still have to pay for shipping			0
and there 's also a cotton vest on sale for $ 795			0
a cotton vest ! ! ) here 's an idea : considering it can cost about $ 20,000 for each attempt at @entity30 , and the procedure has roughly a 40 % success rate , i would say the vast majority of people who were the direct targets of @entity0 's words are not using their expendable cash to buy their clothing anyway			1
if @entity4 , @entity43 , @entity101 and other ultra-rich celebrities really want to leverage their celebrity to ignite a movement we can buy into ( pun intended ) take that would - be @entity0 and @entity109 money and start an endowment for those who ca n't afford @entity30 treatments			1
or consider " @entity118 's " @entity113 , who tweeted he wanted to unload his @entity114 suits in a way that would help those who ca n't afford the ivf treatments			1
retweeting a hashtag is a great way to publicly shame			0
but crowdsourcing among the 1 % could make a difference in the lives of people who so desperately want to be parents that they mortgage their homes trying			0
it also creates a medium in which us regular folks can legitimately express our disappointment in the designers ' words and not take the convenient route via blogs and hashtag activism			0
and yes , i realize i 'm criticizing myself as well			0
but i have some self - awareness			0
when you tweet " @entity139 " -- thus comparing your pr nightmare to the one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in recent @entity143 history -- you do n't .			1
