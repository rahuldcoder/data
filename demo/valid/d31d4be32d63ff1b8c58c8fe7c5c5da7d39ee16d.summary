it 's a striking image : a new baby cradled in the @entity4 flag , held by a @entity6 sailor whose face we ca n't see			1
but is it a patriotic photograph or desecration of the @entity4 flag ? @entity6 veteran @entity12 , a @entity13 photographer whose website is filled with sweet images of babies and their parents , shot the picture of the sailor and his baby and posted it to her @entity22 page			1
" i do believe that this picture right here shows what it means to be an @entity4 , " @entity12 told @entity1 affiliate @entity23			2
" that flag , the uniform , that baby -- exactly what every service member is out there fighting			2
" not everyone agreed with @entity12 , herself a @entity6 wife whose husband is deployed			1
a facebook page titled " you call yourself a photographer ? " posted her photo and said that the use of the flag as a prop was a desecration -- and a bad picture			1
the @entity4 @entity48 does state that the flag should never be used as " wearing apparel , bedding , or drapery			0
it should never be festooned , drawn back , nor up , in folds , but always allowed to fall free , " according to a @entity55 ( @entity56 )			0
nor should it be " used as a receptacle for receiving , holding , carrying , or delivering anything			0
" the threatening private messages , which she has reported to @entity22 , saddened her			1
but she decided to keep posting the picture and to take pictures of other members of the military who request the same picture with their babies and the flag			2
most people posting to the critical @entity22 page disagree with the criticism of the picture			1
wrote one poster , " i am a veteran and find this picture beautiful			2
clearly the military member loves his country and baby			0
" " the photo is making a point , " another photo fan posted			0
" the flag represents our republic , the republic is supporting our future			0
there is nothing disrespectful about this use of our flag			0

a picture of a *newborn* cradled in the flag raises questions
@entity22 critics call it desecration of the flag
a @entity6 veteran whose husband is deployed took the picture
