a decade ago @entity0 would meet potential recruits face to face ; now @entity3 engages in one - to - one dialogue while sat 2,000 miles away			1
with what it says is a $ 2 billion budget , the group produces slick videos in which sexy bearded jihadists are paraded as potential husbands and burka - clad jihadi brides carry kalashnikovs while extolling the virtues of the utopian caliphate and a " guaranteed ticket to paradise			1
" @entity16 , 19 , left home for university one morning in november 2013 never to return			0
instead of going to classes , she travelled to @entity20 ; last february she married a jihadi fighter , and since then she has become a notorious poster girl for @entity3			1
what is so unusual about @entity24 is that she was given every chance in life : privately educated and offered freedoms that many other @entity29 girls would envy			0
and while most were quick to condemn the @entity32 family for missing the signs of radicalization , 18 months on they remain none the wiser as to what prompted her to run away -- @entity39 's parents had actually warned their children of the need to avoid extremist websites			2
following the terror attacks in @entity45 on july 7 , 2005 , the then prime minister @entity43 insisted those responsible were motivated by an " evil ideology , " a " perversion of @entity49 that promoted absurd grievances , " and that they had nothing to do with the war in @entity54 , but he was wrong : the @entity54 " adventure " opened the gates of hell , and today young @entity29 are being seduced by an updated narrative			0
for over a decade mosque leaders have been asked to eradicate extremism but they are no more than glorified gatekeepers whose lives bear little relevance to those of most modern day @entity29			2
the need to tackle radical preachers has crushed political debate and created a dangerous vacuum which is now being filled outside of mosques			0
every new atrocity is invariably followed by useless public statements of sorrow from so - called " muslim leaders , " further increasing the anger felt by the younger community -- successfully drawing young @entity29 away from the path of violence takes more than routine declarations that " @entity49 is a religion of peace			2
" it is easy enough to dismiss the words of wannabe radical jihadists as little more than the posturing of nihilistic adolescents , but the steady stream of recruits to @entity3 can not be ignored			1
several years ago @entity0 recruitment propaganda included videos of men with long beards ranting in @entity91 in front of a black flag , followed by grainy footage of a truck blowing up as it drove towards @entity96			1
it was n't particularly effective as a recruitment tool , but then they only needed a handful of recruits to change our society for ever			2
today @entity3 runs a powerful , slick , modern social media machine distributing messages daily across many different platforms			1
their propaganda contains the same violent , distorted interpretation of @entity49 but it is more advanced than anything @entity0 ever produced , and the authorities can not police it or compete with it			1
for many , the greatest shock has been young girls like @entity39 wanting to leave behind their @entity116 comforts and freedoms to join @entity3 , but why should it be a surprise that young @entity29 women are as angry as their male counterparts ? there is no single road map to recruitment , but for a teenager becoming a @entity125 bride or fighter is much more appealing than becoming a suicide bomber , however distorted that logic may seem to us			1
full of adolescent frustration , young @entity29 are being lured into a romanticized and glamorous world which bears no relation to the misery actually inflicted by @entity3			1
it does n't matter if the narrative is false , because @entity3 is winning the propaganda war : the inability of the mainstream to deal with the anger felt by the @entity29 community provides cannon fodder for the hatemongers			1
@entity3 is left unchallenged on double standards of foreign policy , @entity145 , rendition , torture , or @entity149 's reign , which has left 200,000 dead , because there is nothing that @entity116 governments can say without being accused of duplicity and double standards			1
@entity39 's family describe her as a " bedroom radical " of the type the @entity159 government has been desperate to combat by trying to shut down websites and social media			1
yet last year the @entity162 for the @entity163 found " little evidence to support the contention that the internet plays a dominant role in the process of radicalization			0
" a concentration on social media avoids the real world social relationships which help create terrorists			1
many young @entity29 people asserting their identity in an islamophobic society detest the hypocrisy of their elders , whose cultural and sectarian traditions they consider irrelevant to modern day @entity49			2
while mosques pay lip service to the " brotherhood of man " they exclude 50 % of the community by discouraging women from attending , and anyone below the age of fifty is told to shut up and show respect			0
as for racial unity , it is at best tokenistic and at worst institutionally racist			0
young @entity159 @entity29 live a schizophrenic existence , stuck between their immigrant parents ' cultural identity and that of the @entity116 which does n't want them			0
extremists exploit this identity crisis by offering them a new life			0
most parents would n't know if their teenagers were drinking or having sex , let alone being groomed by @entity3 ; many young @entity29 -- already adept at living a double life -- will hide their digital footprint in exactly the same way			1
in many cases , there is tremendous relief for parents when a teenager comes home one day and announces she is becoming religious , rather than saying she is pregnant or on drugs , but it also gives rise to a false sense of security			0
the failure to deal with the grooming of underage girls by @entity3 is a child protection issue : when a paedophile makes contact with a child , he builds up trust over several months , convincing the child not discuss anything with her parents			2
when the time is right he convinces the child to leave her family and join him			0
the process is identical in radicalization by @entity3			2
thousands of young people across @entity232 are at risk of being trafficked to @entity20 for marriage and holy war			0
in any other situation , they would be regarded as children -- yet pin the @entity3 label on them and the knee jerk reaction is one of condemnation			2
the exploitation of the politics of fear combined with tougher terror laws has created a climate of fear for @entity29 who are portrayed as threatening a " civilized " way of life			0
we are quick to forget recent history : the disastrous treatment of the @entity256 community in @entity257 produced a sense of burning injustice which acted as a recruiting sergeant for the @entity261 for more than four decades			0
today , muslims are being dealt with in the same way .			0

lawyer @entity265 says @entity3 's recruitment tactics differ *widely* from those of @entity0
