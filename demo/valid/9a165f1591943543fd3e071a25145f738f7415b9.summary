an investigation by the @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity0 has found no " substantive basis " to support the allegations of a @entity8 student that she was gang raped at a fraternity there			1
the allegations were first revealed in a story in @entity14 magazine that was initially widely circulated and then increasingly widely doubted			1
" that does n't mean that something terrible did n't happen to @entity20 " on the day in question , police chief @entity15 said regarding the @entity8 student and her allegations			1
and @entity15 said he welcomes any further information that may still be out there			2
that said , there remains one thing we certainly do know — that gang rapes just like what @entity20 originally alleged do happen -- too often , and all over @entity30			2
here 's one measure : today the @entity33 's @entity32 released a new report showing that 80 % of college rapes and sexual assaults go unreported to police , and 67 % of such attacks by non-students go unreported			2
it would be a terrible and infuriating mistake to use the confusion around @entity20 's story as a convenient way to discount this reality			2
while @entity14 's reporting was clearly shoddy , for example , some writers who initially poked holes in @entity20 's story did so for ideological motives			1
for instance , even before the reporting lapses were revealed , conservative commentator @entity51 called @entity20 's story unbelievable			1
" it is not credible , " @entity51 wrote in the @entity54			2
" i do n't believe it			2
" instead , @entity51 insisted , @entity20 's account was " a convenient conversation for an exposé of rape culture , " something , incidentally , @entity51 also doubts to be real			1
" ' rape culture ' suggests that there is a large and obvious belief system that condones and enables rape as an end in itself in @entity30 , " @entity51 later wrote in @entity62			1
it 's all hogwash , says @entity51 , alleging that the very idea of " rape culture " is just " an elaborate political lie intended to strengthen the hand of activists			1
" in other words , whatever the reality of what happened to @entity20 , @entity51 and others were skeptical because they simply do n't believe rapes like that happen with the participation of groups of assailants , let alone the complicity of bystanders			2
this is where they 're mistaken			2
on october 24 , 2009 , in @entity89 , @entity90 , a 15 - year - old girl was repeatedly raped by a group of young men in a courtyard outside their high school homecoming dance			1
six assailants were eventually tried and ultimately pleaded guilty or were convicted			2
over two hours , as the assault occurred , as many as 20 other people watched			0
" as people announced over time that this was going on , more people came to see , and some actually participated , " said lt. @entity100 of the @entity101			0
the witnesses did n't report the crime to police			0
on august 12 , 2012 , a 16 - year - old girl who was incapacitated by alcohol was raped by two high school football players in @entity111 , @entity112			1
in the backseat of a car and later in the basement of a house , the two assailants stripped their victim naked and took turns , one inserting his fingers into her vagina , the other forcing his penis into her mouth			1
this is not in dispute			0
both football players were convicted of the crime			0
as the crimes were taking place , friends took pictures that were shared with other friends			0
ultimately , @entity112 investigators confiscated 17 cell phones used in sharing the pictures			0
some of those at the party even posted pictures of the unresponsive girl , being carried by her wrists and ankles , on @entity143 with words like " rape " and " drunk girl			1
" in @entity111 , four adults have been indicted after being accused of covering up the incident , including the school superintendent			0
on may 11 , 2014 , an 18 - year - old woman was allegedly sexually assaulted by three students at a party after their high school prom			1
the three alleged assailants , all prominent athletes , have been charged with multiple counts of aggravated assault and are awaiting trial			0
according to police , at least one person witnessed the assault in the room where it took place and several other people at the party knew it was happening			0
but no one stopped it			0
in june 2014 , a 16 - year - old girl went to a party where she was allegedly drugged and raped			1
she does n't remember what happened , only passing out and waking up the next morning with her clothes messed up			0
but weeks later , the young woman received text messages of photos showing her unconscious and undressed , apparently taken at the same party			0
the photos went viral on the @entity176 , with @entity143 users posting photos of themselves in the same awkward position , mocking the alleged victim			1
when the @entity182 asked someone who posted such a picture on @entity143 why he did it , he simply said he was " bored at 1 a.m. and decided to wake up " his @entity143 feed			0
this is by no means an exhaustive account of incidents in which young women have been gang raped while bystanders have either cheered the crime , hidden it or stood by in silence			0
and while we do n't know whether something terrible happened to @entity20 , it would be truly tragic if we let this incident cast doubt on all allegations of rape and sexual assault			1
too often rapists are given the benefit of the doubt , even in the case of overwhelming evidence , while female victims are shamed ( see multiple @entity208 allegations )			1
no one , myself included , wanted @entity20 's story to be true			0
that 's absurd and offensive			0
we should not use this case to undermine the pervasive reality of rape culture			1
whether @entity20 was or was n't sexually assaulted does n't change the fact that many women have experienced sexual assault			0
when feminists raise our voices about rape and sexual assault , we are n't cheering on victimhood			2
we 're screaming for something to be done .			0

@entity229 : facts hazy on @entity8 rape allegations , but victim - blaming is back in the *mix*
she says poor @entity14 reporting gave some license to *discredit* notion of rape culture
