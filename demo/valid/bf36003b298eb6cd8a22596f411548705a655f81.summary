you know , this has been pretty traumatic for him , " attorney @entity23 said about his client on monday			0
" one thing that is clear is that he has a large amount of bruising on his body that i noticed that i 'm very concerned about			1
it appears that whatever statements he made , he was without the advice of counsel , and when i look at the bruising , it 's hard for me assess if these were voluntary statements that he made			0
