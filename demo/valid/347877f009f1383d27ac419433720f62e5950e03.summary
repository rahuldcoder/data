@entity2 , @entity3 police have arrested more than 500 parents in and around the northwestern @entity3 city of @entity7 for not allowing their children to get the polio vaccine , an official said tuesday			1
@entity7 deputy commissioner @entity10 told @entity4 that the 513 arrests took place monday and tuesday as part of a government campaign to administer polio vaccines in parts of @entity3 's @entity18 province			1
those arrested will be released on bail if they sign an affidavit stating that they will let their children get vaccinated , according to the deputy commissioner			1
@entity3 's vaccination rate is inordinately low for a number of reasons , including attacks on medical workers , the displacement of people due to ongoing military operations and a lack of trust by some families			1
whatever the reason , the fact that a large number of children are not immunized is having an impact			0
such vaccines are credited with wiping out polio in most parts of the world			2
but @entity3 is an exception , according to the @entity45 , a public - private partnership that includes the @entity47 and @entity48 ( @entity48 )			2
the @entity50 nation leads all others in new polio cases in recent years , and has nine of this year 's 10 reported cases			1
in 2014 , @entity3 had 327 cases			1
the next closest country was @entity56 , with 36 cases			2
authorities in @entity18 province hope to ensure that 2.7 million children there get vaccine drops			0
they 've learned about more than 13,000 cases in which parents have not done so since a provincial campaign began two weeks ago , @entity10 said			2
dr. @entity67 , a @entity48 team leader based in @entity3 , called authorities ' unprecedented move a last - ditch effort to clear polio from " cluster " zones where large numbers of families have refused to get their children vaccinated			1
" first the workers ( try to ) convince them , then their supervisors , then senior members of the community , " @entity67 said			0
" ( this government action ) is the final step in eradicating this issue			0
" polio is a highly infectious viral disease that primarily affects young children , sometimes leading to paralysis and death			0
the virus is easily preventable through immunization , but there 's no cure once it is contracted			0
it went from being a health issue to a security issue after @entity99 intelligence officials used a vaccination program to help in their hunt for @entity102 in 2011			0
under cover of the program , the @entity103 sought to collect dna samples from relatives of the @entity109 leader to verify his presence in a compound in @entity112 , @entity3			0
@entity103 policy : wo n't use vaccination programs as part of operations those administering the vaccines have become targets , with the @entity120 reporting that more than 70 medical workers have been killed in attacks since december 2012			1
and in june 2012 , @entity3 @entity124 commander @entity123 announced that polio vaccines would be banned in another @entity3 province -- @entity127 -- because of drone strikes there			1
@entity123 called the strikes " worse than polio			0
" @entity4 's @entity132 reported from @entity2 , and @entity4 's @entity133 wrote this report from @entity135 .			0
