two @entity2 charities have stopped funding a @entity5 advocacy group that had earlier helped @entity7 's masked murderer " @entity6 , " now identified as @entity8 , before his radicalization , the group said			1
the human rights and advocacy group cage in @entity12 said it accepted the loss of funding from the @entity15 and the @entity16			1
but @entity10 blamed a " neo-conservative " leadership on the @entity2 's @entity19 for pressuring the two charities to halt funding			1
" we respect their decision			0
we thank them for their past support			0
both of these charities have played a significant role in contributing to the development of @entity5 civil society here in the @entity2 , " cage spokesperson @entity27 said friday			1
the termination of funding came after the @entity19 " took robust action " and cited how " public statements by @entity10 officials heightened concerns about the use of charitable funds to support their activities , " the commission said in a statement			1
the commission did n't specify those statements by @entity10 , but stated that " in our view , those statements increased the threat to public trust and confidence in charity and raised clear questions for a charity considering funding @entity10 's activities as to how the trustees of those charities could comply with their legal duties as charity trustees , " the commission said			1
" cage is not a charity but has been in part funded by @entity2 charities			1
as it is not a charity and given the nature of its work , and the controversy it has attracted , the @entity19 has been concerned that such funding risked damaging public trust and confidence in charity , " the commission said			1
" as the regulator of charities , we expect all charities and trustees to ensure that all charitable funds are used according to their charity 's purposes and in the way that the public would expect , " the commission said			1
@entity10 said it had worked with @entity8 and indicated that @entity2 authorities ' tactics pushed him to radicalize			2
@entity10 said that emails he sent the organization paint a picture of a desperate man hounded by authorities who saw his plans for a new life crumble as he tried unsuccessfully to get help			0
@entity8 felt he was being harassed by authorities and tried to seek legal help to stop it , according to cage			0
@entity8 , a @entity96 - born @entity12 , was a " polite " and " beautiful young man " who would drop into the @entity10 office with treats to thank the group for helping him , the group said			0
@entity8 came to cage in 2009 looking for support when he felt that @entity2 authorities were -- in the words of @entity105 , cage 's research director -- " harassing " him			1
but @entity8 has now been identified by @entity107 officials as the masked man in @entity7 videos showing beheadings of @entity112 hostages			0
more than a dozen @entity2 administrative court documents obtained by @entity3 reveal @entity2 security services initially believed @entity8 was part of a radical @entity12 recruitment network for terrorist groups in @entity118			2
the two charities gave sizeable funds to @entity10			0
the @entity16 has given 271,250 @entity2 pounds , or almost $ 408,000 , to cage since 2007 , the commission said			1
the trust had pledged a total of 305,000 pounds , or almost $ 459,000 , the commission said			0
the @entity15 gave cage of 120,000 pounds , or more than $ 180,000 between 2009 and 2012 , the commission said			2
in acknowledging the funding losses , @entity10 criticized the commission			0
" this is just another manifestation of their objective of pursuing a @entity133 on @entity2 islam , " @entity129 said			2
" cage will remain committed to its principle of speaking truth to power and calling for accountability and transparency			0
we will not hesitate in performing our role as whistleblowers and as advocates for due process			0
" supporters of @entity10 tweeted their criticism of the @entity19 and the two philanthropies ' decision to terminate funding			2
one supporter remarked that " if @ @entity151 is not there to provide us with a counter-narrative when it comes to ' radicalization ' ...			0
who will ? ! " the commission said it will soon conclude its " open cases " into the two charities and publish a report and lessons " for other charities which fund non-charitable bodies			2
