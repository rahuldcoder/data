imagine sitting on a dusty , busy street in @entity3 , crowded with vendors and people running quickly about the market			1
a woman 's lapis - colored sari swishes past you in the golden - colored dusk			1
you 've been here since morning			1
a tourist extends a hand with a crumpled paper bill			1
you try to lift your hand to accept , but you ca n't			1
the muscles are paralyzed , and your mind ca n't command them to move			1
you use your knee to balance your arm and grasp the rupee			1
then you use your foot to pick up your bag and head home for the day			1
this is everyday life for @entity25			1
@entity25 , known as @entity26 , contracted polio as a child , and he has learned to adapt to how he moves and lives			1
@entity25 has no brothers or father to provide for him , so he moved to @entity3 10 years ago to pursue the only means of income he could -- begging on the streets			1
photographer @entity35 was in @entity36 last year when the @entity37 announced that polio had officially been eradicated from the country			1
it had been exactly three years since the last contracted case			2
@entity42 was fascinated by this			2
she could n't help but wonder about those already living with the crippling effects of this horrible disease			1
she traveled to a small village near @entity49 to meet a little girl who was @entity36 's last case of polio			1
this gave her the inspiration to begin a long - term project on those suffering in a country that 's now " polio - free			1
" first she met a boy named @entity59 who lived in @entity60 , a state in northern @entity36			1
even though his village was poor , his family took good care of him			2
@entity42 spent time with him and accompanied him during a surgical procedure in @entity3			2
she said that while @entity59 is very fortunate to have the opportunity for surgery , he will still never have a " normal " life			2
" his daily life is hard			2
... everybody around him was working and having a family , and he can not have this , " @entity42 said			2
" so on one hand , it 's ( a ) hard situation , and on the other hand , it 's easier than the other boy i met			2
" she 's speaking of @entity25 , the young man who moved to @entity3 to support himself and his elderly mother back home in a village up north			2
@entity42 first met @entity25 when she was wrapping up the first segment of her project			0
from the beginning , she said , he was very trusting , allowing her into his daily life			0
@entity42 was intent on capturing an authentic portrayal of @entity25 's life -- the everyday logistics of moving through a city without one 's limbs at command			0
she said she was amazed at how adept he was at maneuvering his world			0
he could carry notebooks with his neck , grasp a pencil in between his clutched fingers , smoke a cigarette using his feet and prop his arms on his knees to move them forward			0
social media follow @ @entity105 on @entity106 to join the conversation about photography			0
between the two of them -- @entity111 speaking a little @entity112 and @entity25 speaking a little @entity113 -- they wove a patchwork language of friendship and understanding			0
@entity25 told her of his love interest -- a girl who had feelings for him as well -- but her parents would never allow their union			0
@entity42 said that while @entity25 wants a job , employment is next to impossible for someone in his condition			0
but his spirit is tenacious			0
he knows how to read and write and he is skilled at taking care of himself			0
before heading to the main bazaar in @entity3 every day , he washes and dresses himself			0
there are no days off for him			0
as shops open and tourists fumble through a foreign world in flip - flops and @entity137 shorts , @entity25 positions himself in a visible location and smiles and greets everyone who passes with , " @entity141			0
" @entity42 has been so impacted by his friendship that she said her next plans are to do a project on his life			0
" i want to go to his village to meet his mother and keep taking pictures about his life because he is such a beautiful person , " she said			0
" it 's such a sad ( circumstance ) yet amazing life			0
i want to keep documenting his ( story )			0
" @entity35 is a @entity152 photographer based in @entity36 .			1

in march of last year , it was announced that polio had been eradicated in @entity36
photographer @entity35 could n't help but wonder about those already living with the disease
