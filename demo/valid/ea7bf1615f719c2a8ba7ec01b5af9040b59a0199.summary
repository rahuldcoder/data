@entity0 , @entity1 former president @entity3 on saturday defended his family foundation 's practice of taking money from foreign countries , arguing that while he does n't agree with all of the policies of countries that contributed , he feels the foundation has " done a lot more good than harm			1
" the @entity15 admitted last month that a 2010 donation from the @entity18 government was not properly approved under the guidelines the @entity21 administration put in place with the foundation when @entity24 became secretary of state in 2009			1
@entity3 defended the donations as something that went to worthwhile projects			1
" the @entity29 [ @entity29 ] gave us money			1
do we agree with everything they do ? no. but they are helping us fight @entity36 and they built a great university with @entity38 open to people around the world , " @entity3 said at a foundation event in @entity1			1
" do i agree with all the foreign policy of @entity42 ? no. " @entity42 , the @entity29 and @entity43 are among the countries that donated to the @entity15			1
@entity3 continued : " you 've got to decide when you do this work , whether it will do more good than harm if someone helps you from another country			1
... i believe we have done a lot more good than harm			1
" the story became a controversy for the @entity56 , one where even some @entity57 questioned the practice			2
@entity24 is the party 's presidential frontrunner in 2016 and is expected to announce her presidential aspirations next month			2
republicans jumped on board the story , too , using it to question the @entity56 ' ethics and whether , as president , she would give preferential treatment to countries that have donated to the foundation			2
democrats that did publicly defend the @entity56 noted that the foundation disclosed all of their donation on their website			2
on saturday , @entity3 did the same			1
" my theory about all this is disclose everything			2
and then let people make their judgments , " @entity3 said			1
" i 'm going to tell you who gave us money and you can make your own decisions			2
" @entity3 concluded his defense of the foundation , stating that he thinks organizations should " bring people together across great divides , around things that they can agree on and find something to do to make peoples lives better			1
" the @entity15 was founded by @entity3 after he left the presidency in 2001			1
to date , the foundation has raised over $ 2 billion that goes toward a wide variety of projects , including health and wellness , economic development and leveling the playing field for women and girls			0
many of their projects focus on international issues , such as rebuilding @entity106 after the 2010 earthquake and providing access to low - cost @entity109 and aids treatment			0
those were primarily the projects backed by foreign countries			2
the former president 's comments were the only moment any @entity3 mentioned the foreign fundraising controversy			1
neither @entity24 or @entity117 mentioned the issue			0
at no point saturday did any of the @entity56 address the fact that @entity24 exclusively used a private email account for the four years she served as @entity123 's top diplomat , a practice that skirted legal standards in place			0
the former secretary of state spent 18 minutes on stage saturday and did n't mention question about her email , instead focusing on the foundation and a new report they will put out on women and girls participation			0
that did n't bother the over 1,000 overachieving millennials at the @entity138 meeting who could n't have cared less about the swirling email and fundraising controversies that have defined the @entity56 the last few weeks			0
saturday 's event is the university - focused branch of the @entity15			1
it brings philanthropic minded students from around the world together to talk about their projects and pitch the foundation for funding			0
this year brought together students looking to do a wide variety of things , from increasing women 's inclusion in science and math fields to harvesting potable water from fog			0
in total , the foundation will hand out $ 900,000 to the different students			0
the general sense among the event attendees was : " what controversies ? " " i am here for me			0
i am here for learning , exploring , meeting new people and expanding my knowledge about nonprofit management and social change , " said @entity167 , a @entity168 student born and raised in @entity169			0
" i do n't really care if they address those political issues that are going on			0
" a few students , including @entity178 from @entity179 , said they had n't heard of the controversies			0
" i am here because my college , i had the privilege of them funding me , " she said , before shrugging off questions about the email issues .			0
