respite care keeps families together			2
both save states money over time			2
alas , both -- along with a huge swathe of other vital services -- are under attack by the administration of @entity12 , the new @entity13 governor of @entity14			1
this is happening for two reasons			2
first , @entity12 has a problem			2
he promised to lower taxes despite a $ 6.2 billion structural budget deficit			2
unwilling to think about new revenue , all he can do is cut programs			1
second , @entity12 's cuts are taking place against the backdrop of a bigger attack on disability			1
too many right - wing politicians and pundits see disability as a wedge issue with which they can divide interest groups , pit people who need help against each other and rip apart the core social safety net			1
meanwhile , they reassure their base , which is filled with individuals who also need help from the state , that only they really deserve benefits			1
like @entity12 , other governors are cutting services in the name of austerity			1
@entity45 , under @entity46 , has pushed disabled people off @entity48 , making services less effective and efficient			1
@entity50 , in @entity51 , has proposed cutting long - term care services in such a way as to limit individual choice of caregivers and service providers , empowering the healthcare industry and not disabled @entity58			1
@entity59 has gutted benefits to severely disabled individuals in workers ' compensation cases and eliminated countless positions in the @entity65			1
and that 's all just at the state level			2
nationally , the new @entity68 began the year with a sustained attack on @entity70 , which some analysts see as a way to threaten the whole foundation of @entity70			2
last december , @entity74 @entity13 insisted that the able act , a bill intended to help people with disabilities and their caregivers save money , only be offered to those who were disabled before the age of 26 , a limitation aimed at excluding people who become disabled through work , disease , accident or age			2
now @entity12 is adding to this troubling pattern			0
the @entity12 budget slashes state spending by over $ 4 billion , much of the savings gleaned by eliminating or reducing eligibility for programs based in the @entity94 ( @entity94 )			1
each cut will come with costs to families and individuals who need the state 's help most			1
moreover , many of the cut programs actually save the state money over time			1
take , for example , @entity0 , which provides services to children with developmental delays from birth to age 3 at little cost to the parents ( there are means - tested co-pays )			1
at their best , these therapies not only help children with disabilities learn new skills , but also teach parents to better understand their children			0
right now , a child who is at least 30 % delayed in any category -- for example being at least 30 % less able to use speech than a typical child of their age -- is eligible for services			0
now , as explained to me by a spokesperson for @entity94 , the program has to save $ 23 million ( they did not explain how this number was picked )			0
the plan is to take every child who is 30 - 49 % delayed ( about 10,000 children ) , re-test them , and remove eligibility from thousands of those deemed the least deserving until the arbitrary dollar amount is reached			1
over the long term , this is not only bad for children , but is bad for @entity14 ' budget			1
the program is extremely economically efficient			0
for each dollar spent on programs like @entity0 , according to studies by people such as the @entity149 laureate @entity148 and the @entity150 , the state saves at least $ 7 in future services			1
those savings are , in fact , most likely to be realized most dramatically with precisely the children that @entity94 is trying to exclude			0
children with only mild delays can , with @entity0 , avoid requiring the more expensive special education services in school when they are older			0
despite this @entity161 , acting secretary of @entity94 , is undeterred			0
at a recent state @entity163 budget hearing , which i attended , @entity161 kept saying that the program was too expensive and seemed unable to address the long - term costs of short - term savings			1
he even , in a revealing moment , said that his own nephew ought to get booted from the program because the nephew 's parents make too much money ( a spokesperson clarified that @entity161 actually has two nephews in the program , both of whom have benefited from the therapy )			0
respite programs , which the @entity12 budget eliminates entirely , provide qualified assistance to people who care for people with disabilities			1
sometimes , such a program just enables the caregiver to do errands or have some private time , essential to maintaining one 's ability to function in a challenging home environment			0
the programs also provide emergency backup should the caregiver have a medical problem or some other issue			1
like @entity0 , the program is cost efficient			0
without respite , families are more likely to disintegrate			0
in such cases , the person with a disability is likely to end up in a state - run facility			1
this is both vastly more expensive and , most importantly , generally bad for the institutionalized individual			0
in fact , the @entity12 budget is packed with what @entity211 chair @entity210 , a @entity213 , called , " penny wise , pound foolish " proposals			0
throughout , the governor and his administration have found ways to re-write definitions of disability in order to save money			1
they will likely end up paying more as a result of increased use of emergency rooms , rates of incarceration and homelessness			0
violent encounters between police and people with disabilities will only become more common			0
people who now receive aid that allows them to live more independently will end up institutionalized or in nursing homes			0
not only that , but many of these programs bring in matching funds from the federal government or other sources , and the state is surrendering those dollars as well			1
so why make these cuts , given their likely long - term costs ? it may be that the @entity12 administration just does n't care about long - term fiscal health so long as next year 's budget looks good			1
but i see the rauner attacks on disability - related services as just the latest example of lawmakers trying to re-define disability in a way that saves them money			1
questions about the fundamental necessity of disability benefits infuse right - wing speech on the issue			1
@entity262 , the new senator from @entity263 , was filmed in 2011 calling republicans to " divide and conquer " by separating the sympathetic disabled -- people with conditions like @entity268 and cerebral palsy -- from the unsympathetic ( people he implies are just lazy )			0
that 's a rhetoric i see at play regularly , though most lawmakers are too smart to say it out loud			0
recently , for example , sen. @entity275 of @entity276 falsely claimed that 50 % of all individuals on disability were " gaming the system			2
" fraud is , in fact , somewhere around 1 %			0
while defending @entity275 's claim , a @entity284 host told a woman that her bipolar disorder was " something made up			0
" i do n't hear that type of explicit hateful language from the @entity12 administration			0
everyone i 've talked to is saying that they want to help the most vulnerable			0
they just have a big budget deficit , so they have no choice but to make these draconian cuts			2
but there are always choices			0
@entity12 is just following the right - wing playbook			2
rule out making up the shortfall by increasing taxes and thus raising revenue			2
play different groups of needy against each other			0
tell the public that only some people really deserve help			0

@entity312 : governors are making the wrong choice by aiming to cut disability programs and benefits
he says new @entity14 governor is among those making short - *sighted* *decisions*
