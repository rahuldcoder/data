@entity1 ' recent video showing a child shooting a man whom the extremist group claimed was an @entity7 spy is the latest example of how the militants exploit children in their propaganda			1
as @entity1 encourages foreign fighters to bring their families into the parts of @entity19 and @entity20 where it imposes its brutal rule , the catalog of children taking part in shocking acts is grim and growing			1
the deeply disturbing cases shine a light into the range of ways the militants are using children to further their aims			0
in august , an @entity30 man who had taken his young family to join @entity1 in @entity19 posted a photo on @entity33 of his 7 - year - old son using both hands to hold up a man 's severed head			2
" that 's my boy , " the father wrote alongside the photo , which was reportedly taken in @entity1 ' @entity19 stronghold of @entity40			2
in a video the jihadist group released in january , a boy with long hair wearing a black sweater and military fatigue pants appears to shoot two men in the back of the head			1
the boy then stands over one of the bodies , fires two more times , and later raises his pistol in the air			0
last month , when @entity1 publicized its immolation of the captive @entity59 fighter pilot @entity58 , one of its videos showed a young boy watching a public screening of the killing in @entity40 and saying that he would " burn the pilot " himself if he had the chance			2
those examples reflect a broader effort to induct children into @entity1 ' campaign of violence			1
@entity1 has also promoted videos of young boys training as fighters , some of them wearing the militants ' black masks , holding bullets and waving the group 's flags			1
the jihadist movement has called the boys the " cubs of the caliphate , " a reference to the way @entity1 fighters refer to one another as " lions			1
" it has taken over schools with the purpose of indoctrinating children			0
@entity92 has said that @entity1 and other extremist groups " have specifically recruited children through free schooling campaigns that include weapons training and have given them dangerous tasks , including suicide bombing missions			1
" the @entity100 has said there are confirmed reports of children as young as 12 undergoing military training			1
one 15 - year - old boy told @entity2 in november how he was regularly strapped into an explosive vest and handed a pistol , an @entity108 and a radio to stand guard at an @entity1 base in @entity19			1
another boy told @entity2 last year that @entity1 forced his father to send him to one of its children 's camps in northern @entity19 when he was just 13			1
" for 30 days we woke up and jogged , had breakfast , then learned the @entity119 and the @entity120			0
then we took courses on weapons , kalashnikovs and other light military stuff , " said the boy , who later fled to @entity122 with his family			0
some of the militants at the camp were kind , joking and laughing with the younger recruits , he recalled			0
others made the boys watch hideous things			0
" they used to bring young [ kids ] to the camp to lash them , " said the boy , whose real name was withheld because of fears for his safety			0
" when we go to the mosque , they order us to come the next day at a specific time and place to [ watch ] heads cut off , lashings or stonings			0
" " we saw a young man who did not fast for @entity150 , so they crucified him for three days , and we saw a woman being stoned [ to death ] because she committed adultery , " he said			0
@entity19 activists say that some of the boys indoctrinated and trained at such camps are now being killed on the front lines of battle			0
@entity2 is unable to independently verify those claims			2
the militant group , also known as @entity1 and the @entity163 , is aggressively using social media to try to lure more young people to join its ranks			1
the decision of three @entity169 teenage girls to travel to @entity19 last month was a stark example of @entity1 ' ability to attract young @entity172			2
another young @entity169 woman who left @entity174 to join @entity1 in 2013 now appears to write a blog about her life under the extremists ' rule , describing perks and offering reassurances to those who might follow in her footsteps			0
@entity183 officials , though , say that @entity1 is pushing a false narrative of what things are really like in its territory			0
but officials also admit they 're struggling to counter the relentless wave of propaganda churned out on social media by @entity1 members and supporters			2
" there 's no question what we 're combating with @entity1 's propaganda machine is something we have not seen before , " @entity194 spokeswoman @entity193 told @entity2 last month .			1
