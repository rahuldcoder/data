@entity0 like to complain about the endless political gridlock in our capital			1
but if we 're honest we need to look in the mirror too			2
many of us abandoned the field by not voting in last year 's midterm elections			2
those of us who did vote elected more fire breathers than bridge builders to @entity13			1
what 's more , when we 're invited to tell our representatives what we want , we can be as demagogic as they are			2
remember the @entity18 meetings in the summer of 2009 , which erupted in shouting matches between citizens and legislators over health care ? who can forget the @entity25 woman holding a picture of president @entity27 defaced to look like @entity28 , who demanded to know why former rep. @entity29 supported the " @entity31 policy " of extending health care to all ? his frank response : " @entity37 , trying to have a conversation with you would be like trying to argue with a dining room table			2
i have no interest in doing it			2
" rather than blame our leaders for the dysfunction , we need to change the game			2
we can turn to public forums to tackle big issues of the day			1
consider two efforts to move beyond the contentious debate about climate change			0
in @entity48 , the @entity47 made a splash by voting for the first time to acknowledge that global warming is really happening			0
unfortunately , senators could n't agree on whether humans are changing the climate and what to do about it			0
outside of the @entity59 , in southeast @entity58 , it 's been five years since the region adopted a comprehensive climate action plan with 110 steps aimed at mitigating its dangers and reducing the region 's carbon emissions			0
as research by @entity69 of @entity70 shows , these counties took action not because @entity72 are less divided over political issues , or less partisan , or more scientifically literate than the rest of @entity0			1
no one sang @entity76 or hugged a polar bear			0
instead , @entity58 officials engaged their constituents through scores of open forums convened by governments , businesses and community groups			1
local leaders appealed across party lines by framing the issue as one of protecting residents from rising sea levels and storm surges , rather than as a divisive referendum on whether to believe in climate science			0
rather than seeing citizens as targets of a political campaign , officials governed with the diverse residents of their community to develop practical solutions that garnered broad support			1
" we recognize each other 's differences , " explained @entity102 , @entity104 's assistant city manager , " but also recognize that if we work together we can make @entity58 more resilient			0
" given what @entity58 accomplished , gov. @entity109 's ban on using the terms " climate change " in state policy discussions to avoid polarization looks smart , not smarmy			0
our research identifies many successful examples of political deliberation in well - designed forums where citizens and officials engage in give - and - take discussion and arrive at solutions			1
these forums have developed " participatory budgets " in many cities , energy policy in @entity127 and @entity128 , community policing in @entity130 and much more			1
some of these forums are healing the rotting roots of democracy			1
for example , gerrymandering of political districts has become one way to protect the party in power and create safe seats for incumbents , sapping their incentive to represent constituents from the opposing party or craft bipartisan legislation			1
as a @entity150 state senator once said , " we are in the business of rigging elections			0
" in response in 2010 @entity151 used their power to approve ballot initiatives to create a nonpartisan @entity155 , which redrew political districts that better reflected the state 's communities and helped elect a legislature that could work together more productively			1
this is one reason why the state 's budgeting process , once an endless game of chicken that paralyzed public services and rang up huge deficits , has become less rancorous and more fiscally responsible			1
let 's hope the @entity168 does n't kill this reform			0
but not every ballot initiative is as enlightened			0
many are highly technical proposals pushed by special interests , and multiple initiatives can overwhelm the public 's ability to evaluate them all			1
@entity178 's legislature responded by creating a @entity179 , which researches proposed ballot measures , deliberates about their pros and cons , and makes recommendations on how fellow citizens should vote			0
many oregonians rely on the board 's recommendations , which are published in the state 's voter guide and mailed to every household			0
unlike politics as usual ( and those infamous @entity18 meetings ) , these forums put citizens at the center of decision - making			1
citizens are challenged to deliberate with each other and forge agreements , with officials and experts joining the effort by giving testimony and feedback			0
moderators challenge people to treat other respectfully and consider a wide range of arguments and evidence , rather than engaging in hand - to - hand political combat			1
grandstanding and obstructionism do n't play as well in these forums as they do on the @entity47 floor , partisan media outlets or the local tavern			1
it 's still politics , but it 's a politics that offers better odds of success by engaging both citizens and officials productively			0
the people who participate , many of whom regard typical public meetings like @entity228 , say they actually enjoy talking politics with other citizens and officials , sometimes for the first time in their lives			2
can you imagine that ? while there are experts who know how to design good forums , it 's no easy task			2
as the health care @entity18 showed , simply throwing open the doors is not sufficient			0
most people do n't have the time to attend a forum , so they need to know whether people like them deliberated and the rules of engagement were fair			0
it 's important to ensure that citizens can participate on equal terms			0
if we want to move beyond political stalemate , we should strengthen these innovative forums for citizens to deliberate with each other and officials			1
when these forums work , they put citizens and leaders on the same side of the chessboard .			2
