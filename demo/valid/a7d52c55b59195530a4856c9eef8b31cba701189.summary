@entity3 after a bitter campaign , @entity1 prime minister @entity0 is claiming victory as his main rival @entity7 concedes			1
many questions linger about exactly what this means for @entity12 - @entity1 relations and @entity1 's standing in the @entity14			1
@entity4 global affairs correspondent @entity15 has been covering the @entity1 election in depth and took to @entity18 to answer your questions about the election			1
here are five highlights from the chat : 1 ) how did the race go from exit polls saying it was a neck - and - neck race to @entity0 claiming victory within a matter of hours ? i know , right ? it 's a great mystery as to how the exit polls got it so wrong			1
there 's one pollster here in @entity1 named @entity35 who predicted that @entity0 would win all along			1
he said that the polls here in @entity1 rely too heavily on modern methodology and are n't really suitable for people outside city centers like @entity40			1
there 's also the question of whether @entity0 gained more seats because of the 11th - hour push to the right			2
part of the explanation is that he cannibalized votes from the other right - wing parties			2
also worth noting that @entity1 elections always have surprises			1
in the last election , no one predicted the amazing turnout for @entity56 , whose @entity58 party won 19 seats			2
this time , he only won around 11			0
why were the election polls so wrong ? 2 ) what does @entity0 have planned for his next term ? that 's the $ 6 million question			1
the @entity65 administration was waiting for the election to be over to see who they would be dealing with			2
they knew even if prime minister @entity0 won re-election , they would need to re-engage with him			0
i think both sides realize that the @entity12 - @entity1 relationship is too important to continue as it has been			1
but i think the tone prime minister @entity0 sets now will dictate how the @entity76 deals with him			0
opinion : will @entity0 win seal @entity79 deal ? 3 ) what is @entity0 's plan regarding the @entity1 - @entity83 conflict ? in the final days before the election , prime minister @entity0 made a big push to energize his right - wing base			1
he promised that there would not be a @entity83 state under his watch , backtracking from a commitment he made in 2009 for a two - state solution			0
now the right wing that helped keep him in office is going to be looking for him to deliver on his campaign pledge			0
now that he has a new mandate , perhaps he will feel more confident to explore possibilities with @entity83			0
however the unilateral moves @entity83 have taken since the collapse of peace talks last summer does n't give him much encouragement either			0
4 ) was @entity0 's statement about not recognizing a @entity83 state a political move to get votes , or a true ideal he wants to hold up ? it 's a great question that nobody knows the answer to just yet			2
even the @entity0 camp would admit that they made a conscious effort to reach out to right - wing voters , many of whom do not want to see a @entity83 state			0
for many years @entity0 has at least agreed to negotiate with the @entity83 , even if sometimes actions like continued settlement activity call into question his true commitment			0
it remains to be seen whether @entity0 considers his re-election as a mandate from the right to govern in this hard - line way or whether he will try to soften these hard - line positions			0
in the hard - line way is how he appeared in the final days of the campaign			0
5 ) as an @entity12 , what impact do the @entity1 election results have on me ? in other words , why do i need to care ? i think @entity1 is a very important ally of the @entity12 in a region where there is a hell of a lot of turmoil			1
the @entity12 looks to @entity1 as a stable democracy with whom it shares , for the most part , similar values and interests			1
clearly the relationship between prime minister @entity0 and president @entity65 has soured the ties between the two nations			0
whether the two leaders can repair the relationship now that @entity0 has been re-elected will , in large part , dictate how they work together			0
as an @entity12 , whether the @entity12 has a friend in this volatile region does impact our national security			2
