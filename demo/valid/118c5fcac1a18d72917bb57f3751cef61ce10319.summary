a nuclear deal with international powers on @entity1 's nuclear program is within reach and achievable , @entity1 president @entity0 told reporters saturday			1
@entity0 said negotiators from both sides have found new common ground in recent days , the official @entity8 reported			0
the president believes that " clinching a general deal is easy , " according to the @entity8 story , but hammering out agreements on certain details " will be a very tough and complicated job			1
" @entity1 has been largely isolated for years for its nuclear program , one that its leaders say the country wants for peaceful purposes			2
others , like the @entity23 , have challenged that assertion and instituted strict sanctions , fearing that @entity26 actually plans to develop nuclear weapons			2
after years of basic stalemates , @entity1 officials and representatives of the @entity31 have managed to reach short - term agreements as they try to strike a larger deal			1
the sides have been working toward that end in @entity36 , @entity37 , hoping to get a framework pact in place ahead of a march 31 deadline			0
@entity23 secretary of state @entity41 and @entity1 foreign minister @entity42 , joined these talks monday			1
all sides took a break friday , but are expected to return to the negotiating table soon			0
@entity41 , addressing reporters saturday in @entity36 before leaving for @entity48 , said " substantial progress " had been made toward reaching a deal but that " important gaps remain			1
" he insisted that the international powers involved in the talks , the @entity31 -- consisting of @entity54 and the five permanent members of the @entity56 : the @entity23 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 -- were united in their determination to ensure that @entity1 's nuclear program is purely peaceful			1
the stakes are high and the issues complicated , @entity41 said			0
" let me once again be clear : we do n't want just any deal , " he said			0
" if we had , we could have announced something a long time ago			0
" there has been " genuine progress " over the past 16 months since a joint plan was agreed and in his conversations with @entity42 of the past few days , @entity41 said			0
the international powers wo n't rush the process , he said , but the negotiations are at a decisive point			0
" we recognize that fundamental decisions have to be made now and they do n't get any easier as time goes by , " he said			1
" it is time to make hard decisions			1
we want the right deal that would make the world , including the @entity23 and our closest partners and allies , safer and more secure , and that is our test			1
" @entity23 president @entity86 has made clear that he wants to achieve a " comprehensive and durable agreement " that is based on intensive verification of its implementation rather than trust , @entity41 added			1
" we have not yet reached the finish line but , make no mistake , we have the opportunity to get this right , " he said			0
while in @entity48 , @entity41 met with his counterparts from the @entity60 , @entity54 and @entity59 , as well as the @entity98 foreign policy chief , to discuss their coordinated approach			2
@entity60 foreign minister @entity100 spoke for the group , echoing @entity41 but saying while " substantial progress has been made in some areas , " there were other areas that lacked agreement			1
" the time has come now for @entity1 in particular to make some very tough decisions if we are going to see progress made , " @entity100 said			1
@entity41 also spoke friday by phone with @entity57 foreign minister @entity111 and @entity58 foreign minister @entity112			0
the @entity1 president 's guarded optimism saturday -- which also happens to be @entity115 , a holiday marking the start of spring and beginning of a new year in the @entity119 calendar -- jibes with the progress cited recently by the @entity1 ' counterparts in the talks			1
@entity125 officials said friday that the ongoing negotiations have led to compromises on some crucial issues that have long divided the @entity129 and @entity1			2
specifically , the parties are coalescing around an idea that @entity1 could keep 6,000 centrifuges in any deal , down from the 6,500 that had been under discussion , two @entity125 diplomats told @entity5			2
the pace of relief from sanctions is a sticking point for @entity1 , according to a @entity125 official			2
@entity1 negotiators want them lifted immediately , while @entity23 and @entity143 negotiators prefer they be phased out over several years , contingent on @entity1 meeting its end of the bargain			1
the debate has generated heated disagreements not only in @entity37 , but also in @entity148 , where @entity150 prime minister @entity149 spoke to @entity151 on march 3 at the invitation of @entity154 leaders to warn about any nuclear deal with @entity1			2
the speech was made without the approval of @entity23 president @entity86			1
the next week , an open letter signed by 47 @entity154 senators , addressing @entity1 's leadership , noted that any agreement made with the @entity23 administration that is not approved by the @entity163 could be nullified by @entity86 's successor			1
late thursday , @entity86 reached out " directly to the people and leaders of @entity1 , " in a video message recorded ostensibly for @entity115 , to urge them to back a deal curtailing @entity26 's nuclear program			2
" this year we have the best opportunity in decades to pursue a different future between our countries , " @entity86 said			0
" ... together we have to speak up for the future we seek ... i believe our countries should be able to resolve this issue peacefully with diplomacy			0
" but @entity1 's @entity183 ayatollah @entity182 , in his own @entity115 address on saturday , noted the political divisions within the @entity23 over the nuclear talks , @entity1 's state - run @entity178 reported			1
he suggested the @entity23 president 's @entity115 message " included dishonest assertions and his claim of friendship for @entity1 people was not sincere , " he is quoted as saying			1
@entity182 also said @entity86 had claimed falsely that some people in @entity1 did not back a diplomatic resolution to the nuclear issue			2
what they are in fact resisting is the bullying approach of the @entity23 , he said , according to @entity178			0
the @entity182 also insisted that the removal of sanctions should be part of the negotiations , not a step that only followed the implementation of a deal			0
" @entity1 will never accept this , " he said			0
" this is the @entity23 ' ploy			0
removal of sanctions should be part of any agreement			0
" @entity5 's @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 contributed to this report .			0
