@entity3 @entity1 's " nut rage " case has made its way back to @entity3 , with the flight attendant who served the offending macadamia nuts filing a lawsuit against the airline and a former executive			1
@entity11 , a @entity1 executive and daughter of the airline 's chairman , is serving a one - year prison sentence in @entity16 after throwing a fit on a @entity3 flight because her nuts were served in a bag instead of a porcelain bowl			1
in a civil suit filed this week in state @entity23 in @entity25 , @entity3 , @entity26 -- whose name is listed as @entity28 in court documents -- is accused of " verbally and physically " attacking flight attendant @entity30 - hee in december on a @entity32 - bound flight departing from @entity33			1
at the time , @entity26 , who was seated in first class , demanded that the plane go back to the gate so @entity30 could be kicked off the flight , according to the lawsuit			1
the episode , which was widely reported , was a " prime example of the corrupt and entitled behavior of the members of elite @entity16 business families , " the lawsuit states			2
the suit describes @entity26 as the " princess " of the " so - called royal " family that controls @entity1 , and says the executive screamed obscenities at @entity30 before hitting , shoving and threatening the flight attendant			1
on her return to @entity16 , the lawsuit states , @entity30 was " pressured to lie to government regulators in order to cover up the incident , and to appear in public with @entity26 as part of an orchestrated effort to try and rehabilitate @entity26 's public image			1
" a @entity16 judge last month said that @entity26 's actions threatened the development of the aviation industry and inconvenienced passengers , and ruled that she violated aviation law , changed a flight path and interfered with operations			0
she was sentenced to a year in jail			0
the judge blasted @entity26 for her conduct , saying that she had used the plane as if it were her personal car and that as a passenger , she could not override crew members and give orders during a flight			0
the case is emblematic of growing resentment over the perceived privileges and nepotism of the families that control the country 's top companies			0
@entity26 resigned as vice president at the company a few days after the incident and publicly apologized , saying she accepted " full responsibility			0
" last month , she appeared in a @entity16 court wearing a green prison uniform			0
her hair hung in her face			0
" i do n't know how to find forgiveness , " she said			0
@entity93 , the chief steward who was booted from the flight instead of @entity30 , has said the former executive treated crew members like " feudal slaves			1
" @entity98 and @entity30 , the flight attendant who served the nuts , had knelt in front of @entity26 in apology			1
@entity30 testified that @entity26 berated them about the service and later shoved and cursed her			2
when the flight arrived in @entity16 , the flight attendant said another airline manager , @entity107 - jin , pressured her not to talk to investigators about @entity26 's physically abusing her and @entity98			1
@entity110 was found guilty of interfering with an investigation			0
@entity1 chairman @entity112 apologized to the flight attendants and the public following the public uproar over the incident			2
in a statement , @entity30 's lawyer , @entity117 , called @entity11 's behavior " humiliating , degrading , and damaging to ms. @entity30 , but ... also emblematic of ms. @entity11 's unbridled arrogance and disturbing sense of entitlement			1
" the incident has damaged @entity30 's " career , reputation , and emotional well - being , " and efforts to settle the case out of court have been unsuccessful , according to the statement -- which did n't specify how much was being sought in damages			2
attempts to reach representatives of @entity1 as well as lawyers for @entity26 were unsuccessful			2
