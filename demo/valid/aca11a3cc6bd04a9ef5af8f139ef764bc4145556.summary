" good night @entity1 three - seven - zero			1
" it was a routine sign - off , an all - is - well			1
on march 8 , 2014 , at 1:19 a.m. , someone spoke those last words from @entity5 to air traffic controllers before the @entity7 vanished			1
a year later , searchers have no new clues as to where it went with 239 people on board			1
radar and satellite reports have provided hints , but searchers still have nothing to hold in their hands			1
no wreckage seen floating at sea or beached on shore			1
no fuselage resting on the sea floor			1
experts have said the data indicate the flight path from @entity28 , @entity1 , to @entity29 unexpectedly veered , putting the commercial jet over the southern @entity31			1
but the water 's vast and intricate depths have revealed no secrets			1
and as clarity has eluded grasp , analysts have made many speculations about what happened			1
the most controversial idea : is the maritime search area all wrong ? did the plane land clandestinely on solid ground ? here are some expert theories about what happened to @entity5			1
investigators have since cast doubt on some of their details			2
who radioed those last words to air traffic control ? capt. @entity52 ? first officer @entity5 ? there was much speculation over that , but the @entity1 inspectors in april said it was @entity52			2
the pilots were supposed to check in with new air traffic controllers in @entity60 , but never did			2
one theory is that one pilot may have incapacitated the other , then guided the plane to its end , taking the passengers down with him in a dramatic suicide			1
@entity68 , a retired @entity69 captain , has flown a @entity7 777			2
he believed shortly after the crash that there may have been a struggle			2
" it was one of the pilots that maybe had a meltdown or did something nefarious to the airplane , " he said			2
but @entity1 airlines chief executive @entity79 has vehemently defended his employees , particularly the pilot			2
" we do not suspect any one of our crew until there 's such evidence			2
... captain @entity52 is a very capable man , " he said			2
" we have no reason to suspect ( him )			2
" @entity68 also thought there could have been another person -- a crew member or someone else -- in the cockpit who " was bent on perhaps committing suicide or doing some destruction on the aircraft			2
" @entity98 , 27 , reportedly once invited a woman and her friend into the cockpit on a 2011 flight between @entity102 and @entity1			2
" that 's an enormous breach of security , " @entity68 said			0
but investigators punched holes in the idea , saying there was no indication of a third party in the cockpit , @entity0 reported in april			0
the difference between hijacking and commandeering is nuanced			0
the former term is often used when the hijacker issues a demand such as being taken to a safe - haven country or receiving ransom to release passengers			0
when people commandeer a plane , they might keep the motives secret , said political analyst @entity124			1
they may want to steer it themselves at a target , like the september 11 , 2001 , terrorists did			0
in 1994 , a @entity130 employee burst into the cockpit of @entity132 with a hammer and spear gun			0
he wanted to crash the plane into the company 's @entity137 , headquarters			1
the crew thwarted that takeover			0
" @entity141 would fit with the few facts that we do know , and ( it 's ) certainly a theory that we have n't heard a lot of that is n't a conspiracy , " @entity124 said			1
experts are divided on this theory , partly because no terrorists have claimed responsibility at a moment when they would have the world 's attention -- unless potential terrorists were waiting for something			1
outlandish conjecture or genius insight ? the theory that @entity163 actors on board @entity5 found a way to get the plane through the border territory of @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 to a @entity158 landing strip leased to @entity163 comes from science journalist and private pilot @entity171			1
fleets of ships and search aircraft are looking in the wrong direction , he says			0
the airliner went north , not south			0
investigators may have misinterpreted a key component of the @entity181 satellite data			0
" this is not a normal investigation			0
they need to throw out the book , " @entity171 has said			0
another aviation analyst , @entity186 , also cast doubt after @entity5 went missing on the most widely held belief that the plane hit the @entity31			1
" if it had crashed in the way that we think it did , which is to run out of fuel and hit the water and break up into pieces , there would be pieces somewhere , " he said			0
but @entity198 , an engineer with decades of experience in the mobile satellite communications industry , says the data " accurately and unambiguously " shows @entity5 went down near the so - called 7th arc , a path along which the search has been focused			0
" the current @entity207 search strategy remains the best search strategy , " he said			0
in a less sinister but equally lethal explanation , some experts theorized the plane mysteriously crashed somewhere because of mechanical malfunction			1
perhaps the electronics died , or a fire broke out , preventing the pilots from communicating			0
maybe they turned to look for a landing strip but could n't steer the plane properly			1
pilots had trouble embracing the thought			0
" i 've been running that in my brain now ever since this thing happened , " said @entity223 , an aviation expert and retired @entity69 pilot			0
" one possibility would be a total electrical failure which is very , very hard to imagine because ( the plane ) has so many generators coming from different places , " @entity223 said			1
if they fail , there are other backups			0
he has said he 's never heard of anything like it happening before			0
for months after @entity5 disappeared , @entity1 officials reported details of the search to next of kin and the public			0
something would be spotted , hopes rose , and then it did n't pan out			0
hopes were dashed ; anguish returned			0
sunday , a year to the day after the plane disappeared , the international independent investigation committee released an interim report on the disappearance of @entity5			1
it found no indications of unusual behavior among the aircraft 's pilots and cabin crew before it took off , and said that @entity52 had had no personal or financial problems that would cast suspicion on him			0
the interim report also revealed that the battery of the underwater locator beacon on the plane 's flight data recorder had expired more than a year before its disappearance			1
the battery on the plane 's other so - called black box , the cockpit voice recorder , had been replaced as scheduled , and remained within its expiry date , the report said			1
@entity0 's @entity270 and @entity271 contributed to this report .			0

many experts believe the plane went down in the @entity276
the most controversial theory : @entity163 hijacked the plane to @entity158
electrical failure is another theory
