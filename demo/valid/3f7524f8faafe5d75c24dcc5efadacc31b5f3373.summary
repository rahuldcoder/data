schools in @entity1 have decided to observe two @entity3 holidays and close schools for them			1
after all , for decades , kids have gotten @entity8 and @entity9 holidays off			2
why not add @entity3 holidays to the list ? conservative @entity13 president @entity12 went predictably apoplectic , saying that it was evidence of " discrimination " against @entity17			1
to @entity12 , " family " apparently does not include " non-christian families			0
" @entity12 ' position is that kids get @entity22 and @entity23 off , but we call those holidays " winter break " and " spring break			2
" i hate to ally myself with such people , but i sort of agree that mayor @entity31 's decision is a bad one			1
however , not for the reasons expressed by @entity12			0
i simply find it to be a problematic endorsement of religion by the secular state			1
i can not support the government endorsing religion of any kind			2
there was once a time when most people considered the @entity44 to be a " @entity8 " country			0
however , that notion was never the intent of our founders and is not consistent with a pluralistic and enlightened nation			0
unfortunately , even recent events have shown us that there are a lot of ignorant @entity44 who still think @entity54 is " un-american			0
" because of that , i support measures that tell @entity3 that they are our brothers and sisters , too			1
nobody should feel less welcome or " @entity44 " on the basis of the religion they practice , or whether they believe in any religion at all			2
but this is the wrong way			0
first of all , virtually every recognized religion is practiced in @entity1			1
unfortunately , now only three of them have some kind of " officially acknowledged " status			0
@entity17 , jews and @entity3 have their holidays off , but what about @entity1 's other religions ? what about my religion ? march 6 has long been " @entity81 , " and as a @entity76 minister , should i not demand respect for my beliefs , by insisting that the school district " take ' er easy " on that date every year ? @entity82 is a recognized religion			1
pastafarians believe that every friday is a holiday			0
perhaps it is time for us all to be touched by the noodly appendage of the @entity82 on a weekly basis			0
by selecting only three " approved " religions for respect , we send the message that we value the beliefs of some over those of others			1
such a mentality has no place in a secular country -- even if we have a history of recognizing some @entity102 religions ' holidays			1
because therein lies a theory behind the establishment clause			0
we do n't rank belief systems here			0
in @entity108 , 403 @entity44 602 ( 1971 ) , the @entity44 @entity107 gave us a three - part test to determine whether governmental conduct violates the @entity111 : ( 1 ) the governmental action must have a secular purpose , ( 2 ) it must have a principal or primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion , and ( 3 ) it may not foster an excessive governmental entanglement with religion			1
@entity122 's action violates , i think , all three prongs			0
@entity122 should have used this opportunity to change direction , and state that there would be no official religious holidays â€” that selecting just the @entity102 vein of religion as officially recognized by the state is simply improper			1
this would send the right message -- that the government is not going to get involved in matters of religion , at all			2
this is not to say that i disapprove of any " cultural " days off , or even simply pragmatic decisions			0
for example , in some school districts in @entity1 , 60 % of the students were absent on @entity143			1
the @entity144 authorized local districts to call off school that day , as a practical approach to empty chairs			2
further , it did not improperly send a message that certain religions were valued over others			2
i see no problem with kids taking religious days off , if their family 's beliefs require them to			1
schools can accommodate that kind of thing as easily as they can accommodate kids who get stuck home with the flu			2
i do n't have a problem with even teaching about different religions ; in fact , i support doing so			0
but what @entity31 did here was wrong			1
@entity170 , @entity171 , officials handled it the right way ; they removed all mention of religious holidays on their 2015 - 16 school calendar , including @entity177 and @entity23			1
those days are simply " days off " as far as the government is concerned			0
myself , i intend to continue to observe @entity81 of the dude every year by takin ' er easy for all you sinners			1
i do n't expect you to -- and as much as i would like the government to mandate that we all do so every march 6 , that would simply rot the @entity108 , so to speak .			0

@entity186 : @entity1 mayor de @entity31 says schools will observe two @entity3 holidays . they should not be observing any religious holidays
selecting three " approved " religions for respect says we value the beliefs of some over those of others , he says
@entity186 : why not observe my religion : day of the dude ? official *observance* of religious holidays has no place in secular *society*
