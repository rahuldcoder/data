these are the traits the next police chief in @entity4 , @entity5 , will need to shrink the ocean of distrust between community and police			1
and maybe he should know			0
@entity10 is the police chief in @entity11 , @entity12 , another community rocked by racial tensions and poor police - community relations after the high - profile shooting of a black teenager -- the 2012 death of @entity19			1
and if @entity10 's experience is any guide , it will take " a lot of prayer and a little goading " to convince someone to step into the job vacated this week by chief @entity25			1
" that community , as we see , has been hurting and struggling for some time now , " he says			2
and how : -- the community remains deeply scarred by the events last year , after the august shooting death of unarmed @entity35 - @entity35 teenager @entity34 by a white @entity4 officer @entity36 , and the november decision by the @entity38 not to charge @entity36 , who later resigned			1
occasionally violent protests and sometimes heavy - handed responses by police deepened divisions and distrust			1
-- the police department was already groaning under the epic weight of months of nearly constant protest and last week 's release of a damning @entity49 report that found evidence of discriminatory conduct on the part of @entity4 officials			1
-- add to that the obvious fears facing officers following the shooting early thursday of two police officers only hours after @entity25 resigned			2
the decision for @entity25 to step aside was a mutual one between the chief and city , mayor @entity57 told reporters			1
he 'll get severance and a year of health insurance and will turn the reins over to @entity67 police lt. col @entity65 next week			2
the city will launch a nationwide search for a permanent replacement , @entity57 said			0
" @entity71 of @entity4 looks to become an example of how a community can move forward in the face of adversity			1
we are committed to keeping our police department and having one that exhibits the highest degree of professionalism and fairness , " said @entity57 -- who has himself been targeted by protesters demanding he resign			0
to get there , it might look to @entity11 for guidance			1
there , trust in the police department bottomed out in the aftermath of the @entity19 shooting			0
while no police officers were involved in the shooting , anger over their perceived failure to arrest the teenager 's killer , @entity94 , pushed relations in the community to a boiling point , eventually resulting in the firing of chief @entity100			1
@entity94 eventually was arrested , and a jury acquitted him			0
@entity10 watched the chaos play out from @entity103 , @entity104 , where he was deputy police chief			2
a former boss in @entity104 suggested he look at the job , so he traveled to @entity12 on his own time , getting to know the community and learning what divided residents and police			1
he still is n't sure how to explain why he took the job			0
" the first year , i was still wondering , was it a smart move ? " @entity10 joked			0
but things are better now , he says			0
after taking the job , @entity10 made it a point of spending time " walking and talking " in @entity11 , building relationships with community leaders and everyday residents			1
inside the department , stepped up training in engagement and ethical policing			0
he also stepped up recruitment of @entity35 officers			0
" one of the things that 's going on is we do n't have people who look like us in the community , " said @entity10 , himself an @entity35			2
he handed out long - delayed promotions			0
and he even presided over a makeover , enlisting officers to help choose new uniforms			0
the new chief in @entity4 will likely need to do some of the same things , @entity10 says			1
community leaders and other officials agree			0
" we need to deal with the culture issue here to make sure whoever is coming in behind chief @entity25 is not a new face and a new name on the same type of issues , " @entity149 , a @entity150 committeewoman for @entity151 , " told @entity0 wednesday			0
" we need to seriously deal with the culture of the police department and the municipal courts and the way the city is run			2
" @entity159 police commissioner @entity158 said there are two issues confronting the heads of police forces			2
there is the lack of trust on the community 's part and the lack of confidence some officers have in their leadership			2
on the first issue , he said : " you need to be willing to embrace that there is a need to change			2
" to police leadership consultant @entity178 , whoever takes over the @entity4 department will need to have the same leadership traits valued in boardrooms across the world -- the ability to form partnerships across organizational lines , to think differently , to turn failure into success and to do it all in a harsh media spotlight			1
but that 's easier said than done			0
" there 's going to be a lot of hostility in @entity4 for a long time , " he said			1
so will the new chief need to be @entity35 to help defuse the racial tensions roiling the city ? here 's the politic answer : find the right candidate , regardless of race			1
" you want to find the best candidate to be police chief , " said attorney @entity202 , who has represented the families of both @entity19 and @entity34			1
" but diversity is very important			0
it 's very important that the police officers understand the communities , at least want to engage with members of the community they are going to be protecting and serving			1
" " there 's an old saying in the black community that everybody else is protected and served but we are policed , " @entity202 said			2
" we do n't want to be policed			0
we want to be protected and served as any @entity35 citizen			0
" @entity0 's @entity219 contributed to this report .			0

@entity223 commissioner : @entity224 need to embrace need for change
@entity4 might look to @entity11 , @entity12 's experience when choosing a new chief
that city also had to find ways to heal divisions between community and police
