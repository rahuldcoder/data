the expulsions of two students by the @entity2 for their role in a racist chant will likely not be the last word on the scandal			1
the @entity9 fraternity members can appeal the decision			2
more students might be expelled			1
and beyond the immediate issues around the now infamous incident , the university could experience a trickle - down impact for months , maybe years to come			0
writing to the two students tuesday , just two days after a video of frat members singing the racist song surfaced , @entity2 president @entity16 said they were being booted for " leading a racist and exclusionary chant which has created a hostile educational environment for others			1
" they were given until close of business friday to contest the decision			2
no word yet on whether either will			0
@entity5 legal analyst @entity28 said she believes there will be a constitutional challenge to the expulsions			0
" it 's sort of one of the first things you learn in law school ... you may disapprove of what someone says but you still defend their right to say it , " she said			0
@entity28 added : " i think there 'll be the arguments that these students were students , and that in our educational systems we want people to have , maybe , even a heightened level of freedom of speech			1
" also unknown at this point is whether other students who appear in the video will be expelled or otherwise punished			1
already , the @entity52 , alpha and epsilon have been removed from the frat house 's facade , the house will be closed as of midnight tuesday and the university will board up the windows , following up on separate decisions by the university and the @entity9 national headquarters to shutter the @entity63 chapter , @entity16 said			0
@entity9 is no stranger to scandal and sanctions but he seemed to say that individual punishments could be a bit trickier			0
" well , legally , our concern is we have to demonstrate exactly how the educational experience of our students was threatened or disrupted by their actions , " @entity16 said , " and it really has to focus on the students on the bus			1
did the other students have their educational experience disrupted ? " while he unwaveringly declared " there is no room for racists and bigots " at his university , the very thing that could keep the @entity9 fraternity brothers @entity80 is @entity81 of the @entity82			1
the law " prohibits discrimination on the basis of race , color and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance , " but it also provides the parameters for determining if someone is violating the federal law , @entity16 said			0
any punishment must be " carefully directed " if it 's to pass constitutional muster , although he made it clear he hopes some of the students involved wo n't wait for legal issues to be sorted out			2
" i think some of the students themselves may take themselves off the campus , and i hope they do because this is not a place that wants racists , " he said			2
so far , no students have dropped out -- voluntarily -- but the video has cost the university 's football team a top recruit as offensive lineman @entity118 said monday he was de-committing from the @entity80 and considering other teams			0
it 's an issue that @entity122 , director of diversity , @entity2 student government , worries about			1
" i am concerned about the trickle - down effect from this incident , " he said			0
" i do want to encourage those who are considering the @entity2 that this is a great place to study , and we are going to continue to progress			1
" @entity5 's @entity129 contributed to this report .			0
