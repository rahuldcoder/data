the prospect of a @entity3 state is nil so long as prime minister @entity0 stays in office , @entity0 said in a monday interview			1
asked by an interviewer with the @entity9 news site , @entity10 , if it was true that a @entity3 nation would never be formed while he 's prime minister , @entity0 replied , " indeed			1
" his interview with @entity10 came as he courted conservative supporters a day before @entity9 head to the polls for national elections			1
" anyone who is going to establish a @entity3 state , anyone who is going to evacuate territories today , is simply giving a base for attacks to the radical @entity24 against @entity9 , " he said			1
" this is the true reality that was created here in the last few years			2
" @entity0 went on to say that any opponents on the left who might argue otherwise are " sticking their head in the sand , time and time again			1
" he further said a strong government led by his @entity35 is necessary to beat back international pressure to divide @entity37 and return @entity9 to its pre- 1967 borders , according to a @entity40 report on the @entity10 interview			0
" i do not give in , " @entity0 told @entity10			1
" we stood fast against huge pressure , and we will continue to do so			0
" following @entity0 's interview , chief @entity3 negotiator @entity44 , who is also a member of the executive committee of the @entity46 , said the @entity9 prime minister 's stance is nothing new			1
" @entity0 has done everything possible to bury the two - state solution , " he said			1
" @entity0 's statement at the illegal settlement of @entity55 is a response to all those governments who tried to block @entity3 diplomatic initiatives			1
he could n't have done that without counting on full impunity from the international community			2
now the world must learn its lesson and understand that impunity wo n't bring peace , only justice will			1
" earlier in the day , @entity0 continued his efforts to drum up support during a campaign speech in the @entity55 neighborhood of @entity37 , which he boasted that he helped establish in 1997 , during his first prime ministerial term			1
@entity9 considers @entity55 part of a unified @entity37 , while @entity3 consider the neighborhood an illegal settlement			2
if he is re-elected , @entity0 said , he will continue to promote construction in @entity37 as a means of national security , he said			2
" the pressure around this decision back then was enormous			0
but i insisted -- i ordered the construction and it paid off , " he said			0
" today , @entity55 is a flourishing neighborhood in which tens of thousands of @entity9 civilians are living			0
as we proved in the past , my friends in the @entity35 and i , we will keep @entity37 protected and keep developing it			0
" opposition leaders @entity85 and @entity86 of the @entity87 , he alleged , are " ready to surrender to every dictate			0
" @entity86 , he said , has denounced previous calls for more construction in @entity37 's @entity40 neighborhoods , while @entity85 would strive to establish a @entity3 capital in @entity37			1
" i will not let that happen , " he said			0
" my friends and i in the @entity35 will keep @entity37 united in all its parts , and we will keep fortifying it so that dividing it will not be possible and it will always remain united			0
we will keep developing our eternal capital			0
" a vote for @entity85 or @entity86 is a vote for the establishment of " @entity99 , " @entity0 said , referring to @entity100 , the @entity101 group which dominates @entity102			2
he further alleged that his opponents would yield to international pressure and " huge financial support coming from abroad , from left - leaning tycoons and foreign governments			0
" he closed his speech saying , " the meaning of this is simple : we will not be able to keep @entity9 safe and secure and the terror against us that once emerged through these hills with machine guns will turn into missile fire			0
" @entity4 's @entity115 contributed to this report .			2

" @entity119 wo n't bring peace , only justice will , " chief @entity3 negotiator says
creating @entity3 state is " simply giving a base for attacks to the radical @entity24 , " @entity123 says
@entity0 's words come as he courts conservative voters a day before elections
