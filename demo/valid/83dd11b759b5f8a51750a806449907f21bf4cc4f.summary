@entity1 , @entity2 in a passionate speech about racial progress in @entity6 , president @entity0 on saturday told thousands of people who gathered here to commemorate the 50th anniversary of " @entity11 " that " our march is not yet finished			1
but we are getting closer			2
" @entity0 emphasized that a day of commemoration is not enough to repay the debt paid by the marchers who were brutally beaten 50 years ago as they demonstrated for voting rights			1
" if @entity1 taught us anything , it 's that our work is never done , " the president said near @entity18 , where the confrontation between authorities and marchers was captured in film and photographs that jolted the nation			1
read president @entity0 's prepared remarks the president said that what civil rights marchers did years ago " will reverberate through the ages			1
not because the change they won was preordained ; not because their victory was complete ; but because they proved that nonviolent change is possible ; that love and hope can conquer hate			2
" he hailed the marchers as heroes			1
the president said that " the @entity6 who crossed this bridge , they were not physically imposing , but they gave courage to millions			1
they held no elected office			2
but they led a nation			2
" the " @entity11 " anniversary marks 50 years from the day hundreds of people were brutally attacked by @entity2 state troopers as they marched from @entity1 to @entity54 , @entity2 , to protest racial discrimination in voter registration			1
about 600 people participated in the planned 50 - mile journey on march 7 , 1965			1
the marchers were protesting discrimination that kept black people from voting			1
but as the marchers approached the foot of the bridge , state troopers used force and tear gas to push them back			1
as events were underway saturday in @entity1 , hundreds of people marched across the @entity69 in @entity70 to symbolize their unity with the @entity2 commemoration			2
television coverage of the event in 1965 triggered national outrage and eventually led @entity76 to pass the landmark @entity77 , which mandated federal oversight over elections in states with histories of discrimination			1
50 years later : memories from ' @entity11 ' nurse many of the nation 's leaders , activists and celebrities were in @entity1 on saturday attending various activities taking place in memory of the historic event			1
on saturday , rep. @entity95 -- one of the demonstrators bloodied by troopers 50 years ago -- and nearly 100 other members of @entity76 from both parties joined the president at the bridge in @entity1 -- a bridge that still bears the name of @entity105 , a @entity106 general who was also a @entity107 leader			1
" we must use this moment to recommit ourselves to do all we can to finish this work			2
there 's still work to be done , " said @entity95 , adding this is an opportunity to " redeem the soul of @entity6			2
" the president said that though progress has been made , racism is still too prevalent in @entity6			1
" we just need to open our eyes , and ears , and hearts , to know that this nation 's racial history still casts its long shadow upon us , " he said			0
" we know the march is not yet over , the race is not yet won , and that reaching that blessed destination where we are judged by the content of our character -- requires admitting as much			1
" the president called on @entity76 to restore the @entity77 , first passed in 1965			1
in 2013 , the @entity6 @entity128 overturned a key provision of the law that required certain states with a history of racial discrimination at the polls to " pre-clear " any changes to the law with the federal government before implementing them			0
efforts to revive key provisions of the act have stalled in @entity76			0
@entity95 's memories of the march reflecting a sense of change in the half century since @entity11 , and with @entity1 again in a national media spotlight , the mood in the crowd saturday was of unity , and talks were focused on how to move @entity6 forward			1
but some current @entity1 residents worried that after the dignitaries leave their town -- with a population 82 % black and with more than 40 % of its people living below the national poverty level -- will fade from view except for its historical significance			0
many black residents of @entity1 say they still live in a divisive society and still feel the sting of racism , with true change yet to come			0
@entity166 , 59 , has lived in @entity1 all her life			0
she was 9 years old on " @entity11 " and with her mother had just welcomed a little sister , @entity169 , to the world on that day			2
the two sisters grew up in @entity1 less than a decade apart			0
they graduated from @entity172 and both had to make decisions about whether to stay in their hometown when few opportunities existed for young people			0
" we need to reevaluate our education system , " said @entity166 , who became a special education teacher at @entity172			0
" we need incentives for young people			0
i am hoping today 's events will help us move forward			0
" opinion : @entity1 's historic bridge deserves a better name @entity169 shook her head			0
she left @entity1 after high school and now lives in @entity188			0
her view of @entity1 has changed over the years -- looking in from the outside			2
" i do n't see how @entity1 will move forward without togetherness , " said @entity169			0
" there is no diversity in @entity1			0
people do n't live together			0
" i want to ask white people : ' so why are you so angry at us ? is it really the color of my skin or something deeper ? ' " maybe , she said , the attention on @entity1 this weekend will help spark a relevant dialogue			0
50 years later : the house where @entity206 stayed @entity3 's @entity207 reported from @entity1			1
@entity3 's @entity208 wrote and reported from @entity188			0
@entity3 's @entity209 and @entity210 contributed to this report .			0
