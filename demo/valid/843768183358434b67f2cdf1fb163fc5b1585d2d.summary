@entity0 , saying something controversial ? perish the thought			1
the object of her scorn fighting back ? of course			0
the mayor of @entity8 , @entity9 , has written an open letter to the venerable pop star , taking her to task for saying she never wanted to go back the town where she went to high school			1
" i ca n't be around basic , provincial - thinking people , " she told @entity15 last week on his @entity17 satellite radio program			1
you could almost hear the steam coming out of mayor @entity22 's ears			0
" it 's like someone calling one of your kids ugly , " the @entity23 quoted @entity22 as saying			0
" you 're not going to let that go by without a response			0
" in his letter , published monday in the @entity23 , @entity22 said the city 's recent achievements are anything but provincial			0
" our school district is one of the top performing in the state and boasts two @entity40 , the most in @entity9			1
our universities are among the fastest growing in the @entity43 and are rich with cultural and ethnic diversity , " he wrote			0
buying @entity0 's house : a tale of fame and misfortune " we design and build more robots than any other city in @entity51 , and @entity53 residents and businesses have been granted over 900 patents , nearly one a day , over the last three years			1
not a typical achievement you would associate with ' simple or basic ' people , " he wrote			2
he also noted the city was also named one of the 10 best places to live by @entity62			0
" we are many things , @entity0 , but basic and provincial minded we are not ! " @entity22 wrote			1
" i invite you back to @entity53 to see who we are and what we believe in			2
while we certainly do n't need your stamp of approval , i am quite confident we would earn it			0
" not surprisingly , some @entity53 citizens were n't thrilled with @entity0 's comments			1
" makes me proud to live in @entity53 after reading this letter to @entity0 by @ @entity74 , " @entity73 user @entity72 wrote			1
and although @entity0 has n't responded to the fracas , she of course found some defenders on social media			1
" @entity80 is everyone mad @entity0 said @entity8 was basic ? " @entity73 user itsleah wrote			1
i thought that was the appeal ? small towns are n't for everyone , dummies			0
" of course , @entity0 is no stranger to controversy , and she 's angered organizations a lot bigger and more powerful than @entity90			2
remember the 1980s , when her " @entity92 " video angered the @entity93 ? or the 1990s , when it seemed a camera could n't turn her direction without capturing simulated masturbation ? then there was last year , when she had to backtrack after posting an @entity100 photo of her son boxing , captioned with a take on the n - word			2
and in january , some took offense after she posted photos of civil rights icons altered to appear like the cover of her new album			0
@entity112 , this is n't even the the first time the singer has dissed a place where she grew up			2
in a 1987 interview with @entity118 , she called @entity119 , @entity9 , where she was born , a " little smelly town in northern @entity9			1
" a few moments later , @entity0 followed up by saying she had " great affection " for the place			2
so far , no such love for @entity53			0
nor has the pop icon accepted the mayor 's invite to return to her hometown for a visit .			0

@entity0 angers the @entity53 , @entity9 , mayor by *criticizing* the town
" i ca n't be around basic , provincial - thinking people , " the singer said
