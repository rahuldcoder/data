@entity2 @entity5 prime minister @entity4 and his supporters are trying to create " an atmosphere of hysteria " and " fear - mongering , " the @entity1 foreign minister said thursday			1
" the only explanation that you can have here is that some people consider peace and stability as an existential threat , " @entity10 told @entity3 's @entity11			2
" because a deal can not be threatening to anybody unless you want conflict and tension and mistrust and crises			2
" in a highly controversial speech to the @entity26 on tuesday , @entity4 said that far from stopping @entity1 , the deal currently being negotiated in @entity27 would pave @entity1 's way to nuclear weapons			1
@entity10 told @entity11 that @entity4 's speech had " no effect on the negotiating table			1
" he spoke from @entity33 , @entity27 , where @entity1 , the @entity34 and five other countries are trying to hammer out an agreement that would trade sanctions relief for guarantees on @entity1 's nuclear program			1
@entity10 told @entity11 that he believed negotiators were " very close " to such a deal , but only if everybody avoided " the path of confrontation			2
" " everybody has to make tough choices			2
we have made the choice to engage in negotiations , although we believe that this entire exercise was unnecessary -- this was a manufactured crisis			0
" " people have been predicting for the past 20 years that @entity1 was a year away from making a bomb , and that prediction has been proven wrong time and again , " @entity10 said			1
" but unfortunately that is a reality , that this hysteria that has been fanned continues to be fanned			0
and we try to resolve that problem			0
" while the details of a definitive deal are still decidedly out of reach -- " i 'm not prepared to negotiate on the air " -- @entity10 told @entity11 that he had hope for a " win - win situation for all			2
" " the object of this exercise is to ensure that @entity1 's nuclear program will always remain peaceful , and to remove all the restrictions that have been imposed on @entity1 , in our view unjustifiably , " he said			1
" you can either have sanctions and continue to seek that path of confrontation , or try to resolve this issue through negotiations and through an agreement			0
" as @entity1 negotiates its nuclear future , a war against @entity82 is being waged in neighboring @entity84			1
@entity85 has supplied the @entity87 government with advisers , weapons , and ammunition , and one of its top generals , @entity91 , has been sent to the country , according to the semiofficial @entity1 @entity95 news agency			1
the @entity96 has suggested that @entity1 could themselves be participating in the fight , which @entity10 denied			1
" we do not have forces on the ground in @entity84			0
we have always had advisers helping the @entity84 government and the @entity84 army , " he said			0
" we were the first to come to the assistance of the @entity84 , both in @entity87 as well as in @entity105 , when the @entity82 started moving in in massive numbers last summer			0
" " everybody knows that without our assistance , things would have been different in @entity84 , " he added			0
" we hope that this could unite @entity84			0
" the @entity34 , which also has military advisers in @entity84 and has launched an air campaign against @entity82 , adamantly denies that it coordinates with @entity1 in the fight against their common enemy			1
" this is a global threat , " @entity10 said			0
" you see the implications in @entity120 , you see the fact that they are recruiting from @entity120			0
so this is a global problem , it requires global cooperation and global work			0
