how do @entity0 try to breathe new life into an old scandal ? we 've seen it time and time again			1
here 's how it works : step one : republicans , with nothing in their arsenal to use against @entity11 , selectively leak to reporters a " scandalous " tidbit -- often one that has been previously reported			1
step two : the new media bites			0
step three : the media hyperventilates and suffocates the airwaves with repetition of the same story			2
@entity20 : upon further examination , the story falls apart			0
this is exactly how the latest media hype , this time over @entity11 's use of emails at the @entity27 , has played out			1
and it presents yet another chapter in the @entity31 hoax			0
the @entity33 story about @entity11 's use of a private email account at the @entity27 is a perfect example of " gotcha " journalism , where reporters will take any bait the @entity0 give them without proper vetting			1
the @entity33 has a history of this			0
( @entity44 , anyone ? ) the @entity33 story suggests secretary @entity11 broke federal rules in relation to her email			1
but the @entity33 ' main source for this allegation says @entity11 violated no laws			1
yes , @entity11 used a private email account to communicate while she was secretary of state			1
but so did secretaries of state before her			0
according to the @entity27 spokesman @entity60 , @entity59 is the first secretary of state ever to rely primarily on official @entity27 email			0
@entity11 asks @entity27 to release emails : what you need to know in october 2014 , 18 months after @entity11 left , the @entity27 was engaged in the process of updating its records preservation policies			1
the @entity27 asked every secretary of state dating back to @entity68 to provide records , including emails , from their time in office			0
@entity11 responded to the @entity27 's request for emails , providing the department with over 55,000 pages of emails			1
she did so months ago			0
@entity11 has been fully transparent and has asked the @entity27 for these emails to be made public			1
@entity0 investigators seeking to hype the current @entity31 investigation leaked the issue to keep a dying investigation alive			2
and once again , reporters bit			0
in the days since the @entity33 posted its story , there have been dozens and dozens of stories written on the topic			0
why ? because the @entity89 are held to a double standard when it comes to media scrutiny			0
their perfectly usual , above board behavior is spun as secretive and unaccountable -- while @entity0 are left relatively unscathed			2
@entity94 used his private email account to discuss political business , and when he left the governor 's office , his administration destroyed records rather than turn them over to state archives			2
@entity104 's @entity103 's office used a secret email system , which investigators determined was being used to engage in campaign work on county time and to avoid public records disclosure laws			2
@entity111 's office had files , including emails , cleaned and physically destroyed , including " travel records , calendars , call logs , and emails			0
" why has n't their behavior been scrutinized over and over again ? because their last name is n't @entity11			1
in the end , all we are left with is the benign fact that @entity11 used a personal email account at the @entity27			1
this is n't even a revelation -- it has been known for years			0
looks like the @entity0 wasted their breath , once again , for nothing .			2

@entity131 : the story is another example of @entity0 efforts to create a phony *controversy*
