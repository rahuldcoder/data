it 's seen a rapacious @entity2 rip - off the gullible , @entity4 ponder sweet amor and an air - headed @entity7 harbor intentions of blackmailing a @entity9 agent -- all just a bridge away from the madness of @entity12			1
in the old times , @entity14 's historic @entity13 would be lucky to attract the stars of the silver screen to a @entity19 show			1
today , its home to one of the largest film studios outside of @entity23			1
the " @entity28 " , " @entity29 " and " @entity30 " are just a few of the major motion pictures shot at @entity26 in recent times			2
more than 40 feature length and tv productions were filmed here in the last year alone			2
studio chairman , @entity34 , opened the site just over 10 years ago			1
" it was really awful looking with wild dogs -- literally wild dogs -- roaming the streets here , " @entity36 said			2
" i liked the industrial landscape a lot and the opportunity			2
to me @entity14 was a great opportunity waiting to happen because of the proximity to @entity12			2
" at its peak during @entity48 , the @entity13 employed some 70,000 people			1
but the 1.2 square kilometer site fell into steep decline in the 1960s when the sailors moved out			1
today , the yard is a vastly different place -- and not just because of the @entity56 strutting around			0
a non-profit corporation has been regenerating the location with the aim of creating new employment opportunities since the turn of the century			1
@entity36 studios was one of the first tenants but others have followed			1

" i think our influence on @entity14 in general has been quite substantial , " said @entity73 , ceo of the @entity74			0
" we were the first entity that started investing substantially back into these old buildings on the @entity14 waterfront			0
" and to some extent ( we ) proved a concept -- that manufacturing and industrial and creative companies would want to take root in @entity14 , " @entity73 said			0
being at the forefront of these wider trends has helped attract a new type of workforce to the area			0
@entity36 says housing prices within half a kilometer have risen up to ten times			0
some 1,500 people already work at the studio , which is set on a path of rapid expansion			0
it is benefiting from the explosion in demand for high quality content across mobile devices - and @entity36 sees it as part of a wider trend			0
" old media has always been based in @entity109 and continues to be based ( here ) , film and television has been anchored in @entity111 and high - tech has always been in northern @entity113 , " @entity36 said			1
