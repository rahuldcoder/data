@entity7 was scheduled to die at 7 p.m. et monday			1
" prior to the execution , the drugs were sent to an independent lab for testing of potency			1
the drugs fell within the acceptable testing limits , " the @entity2 @entity13 said in a statement			1
" within the hours leading up to the scheduled execution , the @entity17 performed the necessary checks			1
at that time , the drugs appeared cloudy			1
the @entity13 immediately consulted with a pharmacist , and in an abundance of caution , @entity23 's execution has been postponed			1
" the 47 - year - old was originally scheduled to die on wednesday , but that execution was called off because of winter weather			1
a petition saying the mother of three has turned her life around , even earning a theology degree while in prison , had garnered about 80,000 signatures as of tuesday morning			0
organizers plan to deliver it to gov. @entity37 , though in @entity2 , the governor has no authority to grant clemency			1
@entity7 has become a " powerful voice for good , " the petition says of the woman convicted of orchestrating her husband 's death in 1997			1
" while incarcerated , she has been a pastoral presence to many , teaching , preaching and living a life of purpose , " the petition states			0
" @entity7 is a living testament to the possibility of change and the power of hope			1
she is an extraordinary example of the rehabilitation that the corrections system aims to produce			0
" on sunday night , about 200 people attended a vigil at @entity62 's @entity61 , where they sang her praises			1
" killing her is not going to bring anything back			0
it 's not going to undo what 's been done , " priest @entity66 told @entity4 affiliate @entity67			1
the pleas did not sway @entity2 's high court or its board of pardons			1
in a 5 - 2 decision monday afternoon , the state @entity74 denied her request for a stay , and it also dismissed a constitutional challenge claiming that her sentence was disproportionate			1
and the @entity83 said monday evening that its decision last week to deny clemency in the case stands			2
not since @entity87 , an @entity88 convicted of murder and pardoned decades later , has @entity2 executed a woman			1
the state was scheduled to snap that 70 - year streak last week before @entity7 's execution was first postponed			1
just hours before she was scheduled to die by injection at the @entity96 in @entity97 last wednesday , the @entity2 @entity13 announced it had postponed the execution until monday at 7 p.m. " due to weather and associated scheduling issues , " department spokeswoman @entity94 said			1
@entity7 was convicted in a february 1997 murder plot that targeted her husband in suburban @entity102			1
she was romantically involved with @entity103 and conspired with the 43 - year - old to have her husband , @entity105 , killed , according to court testimony			2
@entity103 wanted @entity108 to file for a divorce , but she was concerned that her husband would " not leave her alone if she simply divorced him , " court documents said			2
the @entity112 had already divorced once , in 1993 , and they remarried in 1995			0
details of the crime , as laid out at trial and provided by @entity2 attorney general @entity114 , are as follows : @entity108 and @entity103 planned the murder for months			1
on february 7 , 1997 , she dropped @entity103 off at her home , gave him a nightstick and hunting knife , and went out dancing with girlfriends			2
@entity105 also spent the evening away from home , going to a church friend 's house to work on cars			2
@entity103 lay in wait until he returned			0
when @entity105 came home around 11:30 p.m. , @entity103 forced him by knifepoint into a car and drove him to a remote area of @entity130			2
there , @entity103 ordered his victim into the woods , took his watch and wallet to make it look like a robbery , hit him in the head with the nightstick and stabbed @entity105 in the neck eight to 10 times			0
@entity108 arrived just as the murder took place , but she did not immediately get out of her car			2
she later checked to make sure her husband was dead , then @entity103 followed her in @entity105 's car to retrieve a can of kerosene that @entity108 had left for him			1
@entity103 set her husband 's car on fire in an effort to hide evidence and left the scene with @entity108			1
police discovered the burned - out automobile the morning after the murder but did not find the body			2
authorities kicked off a search			0
@entity108 , meanwhile , went on local television appealing to the public for information on her husband 's whereabouts			1
her and @entity103 's story started to unravel after a series of police interviews			2
on february 20 , @entity105 's face - down body was found about a mile from his car			2
an autopsy determined the cause of death to be knife wounds to the neck , but the medical examiner could n't tell which strike killed @entity105 because animals had devoured the skin and soft tissue on the right side of his neck			0
on february 24 , @entity103 confessed to the killing and implicated @entity108 , who was arrested the next day and charged			0
while in jail awaiting trial , @entity108 grew angry when she heard that @entity103 was to receive a 25 - year sentence for his role in the murder			2
( @entity103 is serving life in prison at a facility in @entity191 , according to @entity193 records			0
) she began writing letters to hire a third person who would falsely confess to taking her to the crime scene at gunpoint			0
she asked her cellmate , @entity198 , to find someone willing to do the job for $ 10,000 , and @entity198 turned @entity108 's letters over to authorities via her attorney			2
@entity108 has exhausted all state and federal appeals , the attorney general said in a statement last week			0
in the clemency application , @entity7 's lawyers argued she was equally or less culpable than @entity103 , who actually did the killing			1
both defendants were offered identical plea bargains before trial : life in prison with an agreement to not seek parole for 25 years			0
@entity103 accepted the plea bargain and testified against his former girlfriend			0
@entity7 was willing to plead guilty , her current lawyers said , but consulted with her trial lawyer and asked prosecutors to remove the stipulation about waiting 25 years to apply for parole			1
according to her clemency appeal , her lead trial attorney , @entity224 , said he thought the jury would not sentence her to death " because she was a woman and because she did not actually kill @entity229			0
... i should have pushed her to take the plea but did not because i thought we would get straight up life if she was convicted			0
" her appeal lawyers also argued that @entity7 had expressed deep remorse for her actions , become a model inmate and grown spiritually			1
they said her death would cause further hardship for her children			0
for her last meal , she requested an extravagant one : two @entity241 with cheese ( with everything ) , two large orders of fries , popcorn , cornbread , a side of buttermilk and a salad with tomatoes , bell peppers , onions , carrots , cheese , boiled eggs and @entity259 's @entity258 buttermilk dressing , the @entity13 said			2
she also requested a glass of lemonade and cherry - vanilla ice cream for dessert			0
according to the @entity264 : between 1973 and 2012 -- the most recent data available -- 178 death sentences were imposed upon female offenders			0
these sentences constitute about 2 % of all death sentences			0
five states -- @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 and @entity275 -- account for over half of all such sentences			0
as of december 31 , 2012 , there were 61 women on death row			0
women on death row range in age from 28 to 79			0
they have been on death row from a few months to over 26 years			0
currently the only woman on @entity2 's death row , @entity7 would be the second woman in the state 's history to be executed			1
the first was @entity87 , an @entity88 maid who was sentenced to death by an all - white , all - male jury in 1944			0
she claimed self - defense for killing a man who held her against her will , threatened her life and appeared poised to hit her with a metal bar before she fired a fatal shot			2
sixty years after her execution , @entity2 's parole board posthumously pardoned her after finding that " it was a grievous error to deny ( her ) clemency			1
" such pardons are rare , but so are executions of women			0
according to the @entity264 , only 15 women have been executed in the @entity306 since 1977			0
@entity4 's @entity307 , @entity308 , @entity309 , @entity310 and @entity311 contributed to this report .			0

the execution is postponed because the drugs " appeared cloudy , " @entity2 says
