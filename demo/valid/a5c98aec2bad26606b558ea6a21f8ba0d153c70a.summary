just when you did n't think @entity1 could top themselves in finding ways to disrespect the @entity3 , on monday , 47 @entity1 senators -- that is , all but seven -- sent a letter to @entity8 that appeared aimed at scuttling president @entity10 's diplomatic efforts to prevent @entity11 developing nuclear weapons capacity			1
the move comes on the heels of @entity15 inviting @entity17 prime minister @entity16 to address @entity18 -- without even informing the @entity19 of the plan to issue an invitation			2
but this latest measure went a step further , seeing republicans in @entity18 literally stepping on the constitutional toes of the executive branch and formally intruding on @entity28 diplomacy			2
under the @entity30 passed by @entity18 way back in 1799 , @entity28 citizens are prevented from influencing " disputes or controversies " involving the @entity28 and a foreign government , without express authority to do so			0
now , it appears the @entity8 letter was carefully drafted by sen. @entity37 , a smart constitutional lawyer , to come as close as possible to the line of legality without crossing it , specifically by not explicitly taking a position against the @entity8 negotiations			1
yet the intent to interfere with the executive branch is clear			0
it 's one thing for @entity18 to demand it ratify such a deal ( as @entity48 did in 2002 when president @entity49 negotiated arms reductions with @entity52 president @entity51 )			0
but it 's something else entirely to undermine the authority of the @entity19 by sending a partisan letter to a foreign government ( something @entity48 did n't do with @entity52 )			1
sadly , this is only the most recent and extreme example of dishonor and disrespect			1
in the @entity62 , columnist @entity61 recently outlines what he sees as the top six instances of disrespect toward president @entity10			1
his list includes the example of former @entity69 mayor @entity68 saying , " i do not believe that the president loves @entity28			0
" also on @entity61 's list are the time a reporter from the conservative @entity74 website interrupted the president during remarks at the @entity19 about immigration reform in 2012 , and the time @entity79 congressman @entity78 , a @entity1 , heckled the president during his speech to a joint session of @entity18 about health care reform			1
( @entity78 shouted " you lie ! " in response to remarks by the president that , it should be noted , were in fact quite true )			0
and there are plenty more examples of @entity1 slights against president @entity10			1
most famously , there was the widespread questioning of @entity10 's citizenship and academic credentials that included signs at conservative rallies describing @entity10 as a " lyin ' @entity100			0
" and there was the @entity1 women 's group that created an image of " food stamp dollars " with @entity10 's face on them ( as well as a bucket of @entity108 and watermelon )			1
there was also @entity1 presidential candidate and former speaker of the house @entity112 decrying @entity10 's " @entity115 , anti-colonial behavior			1
" plus there was then - @entity118 gov. @entity117 waving her finger at president @entity10 when she greeted @entity120 on the tarmac			0
@entity122 later alleged she " felt a little bit threatened " by the president			0
taken as a whole , this list suggests a troubling pattern of profound disrespect for the president			2
but more than this , it seems to reflect an @entity133 fever that has gripped the @entity1 -- one that the letter to @entity8 suggests shows no signs of breaking , and is a sure sign of sickness in the @entity1			1
is the lack of respect being shown toward president @entity10 about race , as some have suggested ? yes and no. certainly , for a segment of the country , it really is about being uncomfortable with a black president			0
indeed , even former secretary of state @entity146 , a @entity1 , noted what he described as a " dark vein " of intolerance in the party and parts of the country in general			1
but beyond that hopefully shrinking share of the population that is explicitly racist , there is a far wider issue of implicit racial bias -- an unconscious , yet nonetheless real tendency , to subject president @entity10 to extra scrutiny because of the color of his skin			0
none of this is to suggest that all of the criticism aimed at president @entity10 stems from implicit racial bias			0
but such bias appears to be a factor in the ease and extremity of disrespect aimed at @entity28 's first black president			2
and this disrespect mirrors the disrespect shown against black @entity28 in general			2
" @entity180 people can disagree over policy , " vice president @entity177 said in a statement tuesday			0
yes , and they should do so honorably			0
whatever @entity1 ' gripes about president @entity10 's vision and leadership , the party and its followers are too often expressing their critiques in an ugly way			1
and that rampant pattern of disrespect -- for any fellow human being , let alone the president of the @entity28 -- is what truly undermines the principles and values of our nation .			2
