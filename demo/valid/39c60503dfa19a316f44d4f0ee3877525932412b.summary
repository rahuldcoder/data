football is the most widely played sport among @entity3 youths			1
yet , it struggles to attract and retain girls			0
how can football serve as a tool of socialization when it remains the domain of young boys and men ? @entity13 coach @entity12 , who has a coached a number of @entity16 clubs , notes that for a long time , women 's football " was a sport totally marginalized			1
" stereotypes abounded that the sport was too rough , too masculine for girls to play			1
they were much more likely to compete in basketball , ride horseback , or dance , such as @entity25 , whose dance company , @entity26 , is internationally recognized ( though overshadowed by her brother , @entity27 , the kosher supermarket shooter in the aftermath of the @entity31 massacre )			0
since the late 1980s , the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) has promoted the sport to women and girls			2
" over the past 10 years , there has been a considerable development of the women 's game , " said @entity12			1
former player and @entity44 @entity43 official @entity41 concurred			0
over the past decade " girls have significantly increased the level of play , " he said			2
" i am agreeably surprised by the quality of certain female football matches			0
" the sport 's increased television presence helps significantly , especially broadcasts of the women 's @entity53			1
" that has changed a bit the image of women 's football , " @entity12 said , " notably among young girls			1
" @entity60 , who now plays for @entity62 club @entity61 , noticed a dramatic difference in how women 's football is perceived back home			1
" if you look at the @entity3 national team , " he said , " they 've been really good			0
" @entity69 are presently third in @entity71 's world ranking and hopes are high for their success at the women 's @entity53 in @entity75 between june 6 and july 5			1
the professional women 's league is also responsible for encouraging more girls to play			1
" there are big clubs like @entity43 , " @entity60 said , " who are very good and the level of play is quite high			0
" such examples foster confidence to try to the sport			0
" i think a lot of girls want to play football , " he said			2
" they 're just scared			0
" however , enrollment statistics paint a less exuberant portrait			2
at @entity96 only seven out of 345 players in the club 's football school are girls , and two more play with the club 's youth teams in competitions			1
such statistics are mirrored nationally			0
during the 2013 - 14 season , there were 50,516 licensed girls in the @entity105 - 6 to under - 20 demographic , as compared to 997,511 for boys of the same age			1
while few in number , the young girls at @entity96 -- a local sports club based in a town 12 kilometers south of @entity112 -- are welcomed and respected , observed @entity114 , who has volunteered with the club for more than a decade			0
" they are often the ' mascots ' of the team , " she said			0
moreover , they excel on the field			0
the football section 's president @entity120 proudly boasted that two of @entity96 's young players are in formation with @entity43 's women 's team			2
for @entity114 , who week - in and week - out ensures the club 's conviviality , " football has strong social values			0
" she supports girls playing football , regardless of the game 's stereotypes or image , a sentiment indicative of changing or changed attitudes			2
more is needed , but the continued success of the women 's league and national team will perhaps inspire more girls to take up the sport .			1

@entity3 women 's football has long been marginalized , stereotyped as a sport that is too rough and masculine for girls to play
in recent years an increased television presence has raised the profile of the game , especially broadcasts of the women 's @entity53
enrollment statistics remain *low* with only about 50,000 licensed girls under 20 years of age compared to almost 1 *million* boys
