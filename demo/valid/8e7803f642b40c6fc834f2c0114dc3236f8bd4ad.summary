i was finishing my studies when the war began four years ago			1
i had only two subjects remaining before i graduated from university with a degree in @entity8 literature			1
since i was 10 years old , i have loved @entity8 and dreamed of becoming a teacher			1
i want to teach the younger ones , especially now , because children are the ones who will rebuild our country			2
they are @entity16 's future , and they deserve our significant investment			1
three years ago , my family was forced to flee our home near @entity21 , in east @entity22			1
thankfully , we got out before chemical warfare was used there			2
we stayed in @entity16 for the next year , moving from one house to another , from one village to another			1
with each move , we felt no comfort , no safety			2
when you feel unsafe in a place that is being bombed nearly every day , you eventually must make a choice : ours was to leave			2
and with only two packed bags , we did			2
i 've thought of returning to @entity16			1
i want to be part of my country 's rebuilding , but sadly , i do n't expect this to happen any time soon			2
when we arrived in @entity37 , i thought i would return soon to @entity16 -- in only a few weeks			1
it 's been two years			1
and while i still hope to go home one day , my biggest question is : " when ? " i want to return so that i can teach			1
as a child , i was inspired by my third - grade teacher , who believed children are the future and who challenged us at that young age to create a better world			0
i think it 's rare for a teacher to instill this so passionately in her students , but i want to try			1
although i hope to follow in my teacher 's footsteps , my path for now is blocked by the uncertainty of living far from home , by a war that has driven me here , by tuition costs in @entity37 that are prohibitively expensive			1
being away from home presents many challenges			2
you feel like a stranger in a foreign place			0
you 're not among people who know you , or who want to know you			0
as a @entity16 refugee , it is nearly impossible to get permission to be officially employed , and i 've no money to complete my studies			1
overnight , my dreams changed			0
in one moment i was at home with family and friends dreaming of studying @entity8 , of becoming a schoolteacher			2
in the next , it all feels lost			0
it 's impossible to work , impossible to study			0
we hope to meet our needs today , not so much to fulfill our dreams tomorrow			0
in @entity16 , i was responsible to my parents , now i am responsible for them			1
i dreamed of being a teacher , but because my parents are old , i must try each week just to protect them , to cover their basic needs of shelter , food and medicine			0
i needed some way to support my family			0
while most @entity16 are not permitted to work , we can volunteer			1
i found a role with the poverty - fighting organization @entity100 in the urban refugee center in @entity102 , @entity37 , where i earn a stipend doing meaningful volunteer work			1
i have enjoyed it so much			0
after working there , i have become more social , and no longer feel isolated			0
it 's not like sitting at home , feeling powerless , losing confidence , wondering what i can do to help my family , to help my people			2
instead , i feel empowered			0
and , because of that , i refuse to give up on my dreams			0
my hope is to resettle for the short term in another country so i can continue my studies			0
i want to complete my education -- and reclaim my dream of teaching @entity16 children			1
resettling could help shape my future so that i can help shape theirs			0
one day , i will tell them of the crisis we faced in the @entity16 that i left			1
we must be aware of this history , and learn from it			0
we must empower children to speak up and then be sure that their voices are heard			0
and it starts with us			0
each person has the right to pursue an education , to meet their most basic needs , to express themselves			2
when those rights are stifled , so , too , is a person 's potential , her opportunities , her power to create a better world , and in my case , a better @entity16			1
my question to the @entity149 people and the international community is this : imagine your life has been turned upside down after you lose everything in a matter of hours : what do you believe in then ? what do you cling to ? the answer , i think , is : your dreams			0
@entity163 , for the time being , have been deferred .			0

four years of war means four years without schools and education in @entity16
@entity169 was nearly done with university when she was forced to flee her home near @entity21
to help @entity169 and the many other displaced @entity16 students , go to @entity100
