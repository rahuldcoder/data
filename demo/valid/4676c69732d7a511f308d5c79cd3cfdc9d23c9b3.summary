gov. @entity0 unleashed a firestorm on @entity3 last week when he signed the @entity4			1
critics of the law contend it could be used by individuals and businesses to discriminate -- particularly against the lgbt community of lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender individuals -- on the basis of religion			1
the ramifications for the @entity17 are just starting to be felt in the form of boycotts , petitions and travel bans			1
as the controversy mushrooms , here 's what got us to where we are			1
and where things are headed			1
last week , @entity0 put his signature on the @entity4 -- a law that allows @entity3 businesses to cite their religious freedom as a legal defense			1
the law states that the government ca n't " substantially burden a person 's exercise of religion " and that individuals who feel like their religious beliefs have been or could be " substantially burdened " can lean on this law to fend off lawsuits			1
in an opinion piece in @entity44 , @entity0 says the @entity4 " ensures that @entity3 law will respect religious freedom and apply the highest level of scrutiny to any state or local governmental action that infringes on people 's religious liberty			1
" @entity0 notes that there is no reference to sexual orientation in the law			1
civil liberties and gay rights groups hold to their stance that the law could be used by businesses to deny service to people based on their sexual orientation and justify that discrimination based on their religious belief			1
" silence is consent ! " tweets @entity67 , a commentator on @entity68			1
from sports teams to musicians to other cities and states , they fell like dominoes			1
the @entity77 , which is headquartered in @entity78 and set to host its men 's basketball @entity79 in the city this week , said the law could lead it to move events elsewhere in future years			2
the @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 issued critical statements too			2
@entity89 owner @entity88 says fans of all stripes are welcome			2
" the @entity89 have always embraced inclusiveness , tolerance , and a diverse fan base , " @entity88 tweets			2
" we welcome all fans to @entity98			2
one family ! " a petition posted on @entity101 hopes to get the @entity102 to move its football championship out of @entity78			2
" i think that @entity3 needs to be told that it must respect all persons regardless of sex , age , religion , gender identity , or sexual orientation , " @entity104 of @entity105 , @entity106 , says in the petition			1
" as a football fan , i think we can send a message by calling on the @entity77 and @entity102 to take a stand			2
" @entity116 in @entity78 is scheduled to host the league 's championship game through the 2021 season			2
at last check , the petition had more than 11,000 supporters			2
the mayors of @entity124 and @entity125 have barred spending on travel to @entity3			1
the governors of @entity130 and @entity129 did the same thing			2
and you can add @entity133 to the boycott bandwagon			2
the group is canceling its may 7 show in @entity78 , it says on @entity138			2
" the ' @entity139 ' feels like thinly disguised legal discrimination to us , " @entity133 says			2
" hope to get back to the @entity17 someday soon , when this odious measure is repealed			0
" @entity143 is among the artists speaking out			0
her son @entity145 is a transgender man			0
" # @entity146 is another example of right wing racism , @entity150 , " she tweets			0
@entity3 's top two state lawmakers pledged monday to amend the state 's controversial " religious freedom " law to clarify that it can not be used to discriminate against gay people			1
" this law does not discriminate , and it will not be allowed to do so , " @entity156 , the @entity3 @entity157 president pro tem , said during a news conference with state house speaker @entity160			1
@entity0 had said earlier that he was working with lawmakers to clarify the law			0
critics still were n't on board with the anti-discrimination claims			1
opponents of @entity4 marched around the state capitol			1
someone even created a satire ad : " @entity3			1
it 's a great place to be a bigot			0
the rhetoric has reached such a fever pitch that a front page editorial in tuesday 's edition of the @entity177 blares the headline : " fix			0
" the editorial suggests the @entity4 and protections for gays and lesbians can co-exist			1
the state is at a crossroads it says			0
" ( @entity186 ) o matter its original intent ( the law ) already has done enormous harm to our state and potentially our economic future , " according to the editorial			0
" only bold action -- action that sends an unmistakable message to the world that our state will not tolerate discrimination against any of its citizens -- will be enough to reverse the damage			0
" the editorial closes with : " governor , @entity3 is in a state of crisis			1
it is worse than you seem to understand			0
" you must act with courage and wisdom			0
you must lead us forward now			0
you must ensure that all @entity211 have strong protections against discrimination			0
" the laws can co-exist			0
" some of the @entity216 's top figures are backing @entity0 despite the controversy			0
@entity218 and @entity219 have voiced their support			0
both are considered likely @entity216 candidates for the @entity224			0
sen. @entity225 , who announced his candidacy last week , is also on board			0
" i 'm proud to stand with gov. @ mike_pence for religious liberty , and i urge @entity232 to do the same , " @entity225 tweets			0
@entity3 is the 20th state to adopt a " religious freedom restoration " law , most of which are modeled after the @entity4 , which president @entity235 signed into law in 1993			1
but that law passed with the backing of a broad - based coalition and was n't set against the backdrop of gay rights or the wave of marriage equality laws that have swept the country in recent years			0
@entity246 , a spokesman with the @entity247 , a gay rights group , stresses that those 20 laws are " dramatically different in their scope and effect			0
" " calling them similar in this way risks being misleading			0
@entity3 is the broadest and most dangerous law of its kind in the country , " @entity246 says			1
@entity258 ' legislature passed an @entity3 - style law on friday , which now heads to the state 's governor for approval			1
despite the controversy , the @entity3 governor says concerns that his state 's new " religious freedom " law will allow businesses to turn away @entity271 customers is the result of a " tremendous amount of misinformation and misunderstanding			1
" still , he was hard pressed to explain why that was n't the case			0
given a chance on sunday to add some clarity , @entity0 refused to answer at least six yes - or - no questions from @entity283 's @entity282 about whether the measure legalizes discrimination against gays and lesbians			0
@entity288 and @entity289 contributed to this report .			0
