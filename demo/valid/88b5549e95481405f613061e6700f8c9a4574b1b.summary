the big search is over			0
that 's the message out of @entity3 , where national search and rescue chief @entity4 announced that the main search - and - recovery operation surrounding doomed commercial airliner @entity7 officially ended tuesday			1
" these past two months have been the hardest times for all of us at @entity10 and for the families of qz8501 passengers , " airasia @entity3 ceo @entity9 said			1
" no words can express how grateful we are for all the prayers , love and support given us			0
" he was referring to the nightmare that the airline and , especially , the loved ones of the 162 people on board the @entity26 have been experiencing since its crew lost contact with air traffic controllers on december 28			1
@entity3 transportation minister @entity31 later explained the plane climbed rapidly , then stalled shortly before it crashed			2
unlike @entity34 , which disappeared a year ago and still has n't been located , there has been less mystery and more closure over @entity37			2
that 's because searchers did find remnants from the @entity10 aircraft and the remains of some passengers in the @entity44			1
that included the jetliner 's fuselage , the last major piece of which was recovered late last month and brought into a @entity51 port earlier this week			1
as of tuesday , authorities had identified the bodies of 94 who had been on the @entity10 plane , with six other bodies still in @entity58 's @entity57			2
yet that leaves scores of other families still waiting			0
the decision to call off the main search stems from the fact no more human remains were found in the past week , @entity4 explained			0
but that does n't mean authorities wo n't be looking at all			0
there will be a smaller - scale operation , involving divers and three vessels , over the next week , according to @entity3 's @entity72			1
after that , the plan is to call off the search entirely .			0

@entity37 went down in december with 162 on board ; 100 bodies have been recovered so far
@entity3 's search and rescue chief says the operation is moving into a new *phase*
there will be a smaller - scale search for one more week in the @entity44
