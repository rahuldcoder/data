he does n't wear a uniform or hold an official rank , but @entity4 is a powerful military leader in @entity5			1
he leads the @entity6 , a predominantly @entity7 paramilitary force doing much of the fighting in the critical battle to take @entity10 from @entity12 extremists			2
ousting @entity12 from @entity10 is important for dozens of countries in the @entity15 - led coalition trying to thwart the @entity18 extremist group 's quest to grow its caliphate			1
@entity20 is n't a part of this coalition , but it is also working to defeat @entity12 -- something that 's provoked both relief and alarm in @entity26			1
@entity4 is confident his men , with help from the @entity5 army and some @entity30 , can crush @entity12 in @entity5 without this coalition 's help			1
he 's sure because the @entity20 are advising them			1
" we do n't need it , and we wo n't need it , " he said			0
" anyone who puts their faith in the international coalition to liberate @entity5 is putting their faith on a mirage			1
" @entity20 knows what it 's doing , in his view			1
" yes , we declare to the world , we have @entity20 advisers , and we 're proud of them , and we thank them deeply for participating with us because @entity20 has more experience than anyone else on @entity50 in fighting terrorism			2
" does it matter that @entity20 is advising militias fighting @entity12 ? does it matter which countries are taking part in the fight against @entity12 -- including that one of them , @entity20 , is a longstanding @entity15 foe ? when asked questions along those lines wednesday in @entity26 , it seemed that even top @entity15 military officials did n't have easy answers			1
the view is that defeating @entity12 is good , while relying on and possibly strengthening @entity20 is not			1
in other words , @entity20 's involvement in @entity5 is a mixed blessing			1
to make sense of this all , one needs to understand not only the international landscape and @entity5 politics , but @entity74 itself			2
the religion 's two major sects are @entity78			0
in @entity5 , @entity30 comprise 15 % to 20 % of @entity5 's population , with about half of them in urban areas like @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity10 , according to the @entity85			2
about 18 % of @entity5 's population is @entity86			2
that means the vast majority of @entity5 are @entity89			0
during his decades - long rule , @entity95 -- a @entity78 whose hometown is @entity10 -- gave positions of power to @entity30 , and marginalized @entity89 , experts say			0
many @entity89 families fled to @entity20 and the country gave them housing and jobs and schooled their children			0
that imbued @entity5 shiites who have returned home with a fierce allegiance to @entity20			1
@entity89 have led @entity5 since @entity95 's ouster , often alienating @entity30 in the process			2
this has fueled major sectarian rifts that peaked when @entity111 was prime minister , leading to not only millions of disaffected citizens but a weaker central government and military that @entity12 frequently overran in 2013 and 2014			2
@entity115 took over as prime minister last year in part to address these deep divisions			0
still , some @entity30 have n't seen the change they want : for instance , @entity120 in february called for direct @entity15 arming of @entity78 tribes like his or at least pressure to make @entity5 's government help them more in the fight for @entity128			1
and @entity89 militias sometimes have done more to hurt than help the cause of unity			0
the advocacy group @entity132 has documented what it calls escalating " abuses by militias allied with @entity5 security forces in @entity78 areas , " pointing to instances in which residents have been forced from their homes , kidnapped and executed			0
such treatment has happened in remote areas as well as the @entity5 capital , according to the group			0
" sunnis are a minority in @entity83 , but they 're the majority in our morgue , " an @entity146 doctor told @entity132 last july			0
just a few days ago , @entity5 's most powerful @entity89 cleric @entity152 said people " must always act with self - control , " according to the @entity155			2
still , there 's hardly a guarantee such calls for restraint will be answered , especially amid the chaos of war			0
the fear is that mostly @entity7 militias , like the one led by @entity164 , will inflame the tinderbox of sectarian strife -- with @entity132 warning of revenge attacks on @entity30 in @entity10			0
add to this equation the fact that @entity12 is made up @entity30 who consider @entity89 heretics and apostates , slaughtering them in large numbers			0
civilians and troops alike have faced their wrath : the most glaring incident may have been last june , when the militant group overran an @entity5 military base once known as @entity180 -- which , notably , is near @entity10 -- and claimed to kill some 1,600 air force cadets , the vast majority of them @entity89			2
given these harsh realities , it 's not necessarily cut and dried what a @entity78 citizen in @entity10 will think if either @entity7 militias or the @entity7 - led @entity5 military battle the @entity78 group @entity12			1
" do i choose the @entity5 military ( which is working with the @entity15 - led coalition ) or @entity12 ? do i choose leukemia or the plague ? ... which groups do they dislike more ? " said @entity194 , a strategy expert and the award - winning author of " @entity197 : explaining victory and defeat in @entity202			1
" " it 's not like the @entity30 love @entity12 ; most do n't			2
but some think the @entity89 government is a bigger threat than @entity12			0
" so what should the @entity15 do ? @entity208 , a lecturer on terrorism at @entity210 who this month published , " @entity12 : the @entity216 , " says it 's imperative to address the sectarian divisions in @entity5 and continue pushing for changes in its government			1
she notes that " the @entity221 , @entity7 - promoting government of @entity111 " was a big reason @entity12 was able " to take root " in @entity5			1
" many @entity30 feel under siege			0
@entity12 is saying , ' we 're going to protect you			0
@entity12 is presenting itself as a savior of @entity30 , " she said			0
but , as @entity194 points out , reform in a bureaucracy comes slow			0
there 's been talk for years about healing @entity5 's sectarian divide			2
what 's to say talk will translate into action anytime soon ? @entity194 thinks the @entity15 should consider sweetening the carrots offered to the @entity5 as incentives -- and start carrying bigger sticks -- to spur it to get its act together			1
the biggest stick would be pulling out of the fight against @entity12			0
" right now we seem to be limping along with whatever they do , " he said			0
" we 're not offering them many goodies to do what we want and not making them feel like they 're going to suffer much either if they do n't do what we want			0
it 's part of this quandary because it shares a border with @entity5 , has its own interest in fending off @entity12 , and is predominantly @entity7			1
it 's also a staunch foe of the @entity15 , which its leaders have cast as the " @entity256			2
" that lack of love is mutual , with @entity26 leading a years - long standoff with @entity260 over its nuclear program			0
( there are ongoing talks aimed at resolving that impasse , but critically no deal yet			0
) yet @entity12 is likewise @entity15 's enemy , with president @entity266 saying that the goal is to " degrade and ultimately destroy " that group			1
it 's not in @entity20 's interest to have @entity5 devolve into a sectarian war , says retired @entity15 air force lt. col. @entity271 , a @entity1 military analyst			1
" the @entity20 are smart enough to know that 's a possibility , so they would be telling the @entity7 - led militias not to make this a @entity7 fight , " @entity271 said			2
but what should the @entity15 think about @entity20 's efforts to defeat @entity12 by backing @entity7 - led militias ? speaking at a congressional hearing wednesday about the @entity281 's request for use of force to fight @entity12 , the chairman of the @entity285 opined that @entity20 's involvement in helping @entity5 forces is a good thing			1
" anything anyone does to counter @entity12 is in the main a good outcome , " gen. @entity289 said			0
defense secretary @entity293 suggested that the matter was more nuanced			1
the @entity15 is worried about @entity20 's role , he said			1
" it is something that is concerning to us , " he said of @entity20 's role , " in particular because the sectarian danger in @entity5 is the principal thing that can unravel the campaign against @entity12			1
" @entity1 's @entity303 contributed to this report .			0

@entity307 leader in @entity5 says @entity20 knows what it 's doing ; coalition help not needed
a top @entity15 military leader says anything or anyone who fights @entity12 is welcome
yet the defense secretary says the @entity15 is concerned about @entity20 's involvement
