there seems to be an ever - growing list of people , places and things that will turn you gay			0
maybe we should think of these as the brigade of evil , homosexual nouns			0
there were the @entity12 and @entity13 a decade ago			1
now , as these views thankfully get more fringe , the theories are becoming increasingly bizarre and awesome			1
among the homo nouns , there 's the @entity19 , according to a @entity21 lawmaker ( education policy is super gay , obviously ) ; @entity25 , who an op - ed writer for @entity28 , @entity29 , claims is being used by @entity30 to " attract young girls " to her show ( uh-huh ) ; the @entity36 princess movie " @entity40 , " according to radio hosts in @entity38 ( that dress ! ) ; and now , according to a potential 2016 @entity34 presidential contender , @entity32 , there 's prison			1
stay away from crime , kids			0
@entity32 , who , let me reiterate , is a potential presidential candidate from a major @entity54 party , and a neurosurgeon to boot , told @entity1 's @entity57 in an interview that aired wednesday that " a lot of people ... go into prison straight -- and when they come out , they 're gay			1
" asked if being gay was a choice , @entity32 replied in a word : " absolutely			1
" this level of ignorance is so last century , so near - irrelevant , that i 'm hesitant even to respond			0
but no one who holds these beliefs belongs in a race for the 2016 @entity71			1
ordinarily , i 'm the kind of gay person who likes to give people room to evolve			0
i know not everyone " gets it " automatically			0
that 's ok , as long as you are n't hateful about it , are willing to listen and do n't try to restrict the rights of lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people			2
i 'm from @entity85 , a deeply conservative state , and i 've seen friends , family and co-workers evolve			0
people who thought being gay was a sin -- or that it was a choice , or fixable -- now support same - sex marriage			0
but presidential candidates do n't get that leeway			0
( in fact , he later apologized , regretting his words but saying the science on the issue of sexual orientation is n't clear			0
) these views belong in another decade , not modern @entity54			1
this apparently still needs to be said : being gay is not a choice			0
do n't believe me ? well , ask a gay person			0
as i mentioned , i 'm one of those ( despite never having seen " @entity40 " in its entirety ) , and i can tell you that , for me , it was n't a choice			0
it 's not something i would want to undo , but it also is n't like i woke up one day and was like , huh , you know what would really mix it up this winter ? dating dudes instead of ladies			2
science backs me on this			0
i 'm not going to roll through all the details , but @entity124 from @entity125 sums it up pretty well : " in study after study , biologists have found that homosexuality , at least in men , is clearly , undoubtedly , inarguably an inborn trait			0
" and even if it were a choice , who cares ? a person 's religion is a choice			2
yet the @entity54 offers certain protections based on religion			1
@entity32 , meanwhile , opposes same - sex marriage			1
that 's a stance that , again , thankfully , is getting exceedingly rare in national politics			2
it 's also an issue that , along with transgender rights and employment discrimination against @entity149 people , should be a focal point in the 2016 campaign cycle			1
i hope that @entity54 is evolved enough not to elect a candidate who opposes lgbt rights			1
i do think we live in that country these days			0
it 's a country that mostly laughs at someone saying prison would " turn " someone gay			1
but the point remains that saying so both belittles a serious issue of violence -- that of men raping other men in prison , which has nothing to do with turning anyone gay and everything to do with criminal activity			2
and it 's a serious lapse in logic			2
being around a bunch of dudes -- or ladies -- in prison does n't change a person 's innate sexual attractions			1
it 's so obvious i should n't have to say it			2
and the @entity54 people damn sure should n't have to listen to it			1
especially coming from a 2016 presidential contender , it 's almost laughably irrelevant			1
