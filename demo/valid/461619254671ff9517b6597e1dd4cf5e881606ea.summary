superheroes have always had a special place in my heart			1
i grew up in @entity5 in the 1980s , an era that marked the beginning of the country 's worst economic crisis			1
my childhood memories are of a prolonged state of emergency that was characterized by acute food shortages and an economic decline where the basic needs of the average @entity5 family were barely met			1
my siblings and i -- and our gang of friends from around the farmlands -- spent countless hours sitting on a deserted piggery wall , perfecting our extra-terrestrial code language			1
our goal was to send an sos out to the superheroes in the galaxies , and had our code language been refined enough to reach across the chasm of space , perhaps a spaceship would come down to @entity31 to save us from our dreary lives and carry us away into outer space			1
searching for superheroes rewind to just a few years earlier -- in the mid to late 1970s and before the economic decline -- when superheroes like @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and the @entity40 were huge deals for anyone growing up			1
in our childhood eyes , these were powerful , all - embodying beings , and their brands were merchandised on t - shirts , caps , lunchboxes , toys , and just about everything			1
they influenced many aspects of the childhood experience to such an extent that i spent a lot of my formative years aspiring to become a superhero when i grew up			1
but then disillusionment set in			1
it dawned on me that i would never be a superhero seeing as most of them were male -- and all of them white			2
the frantic search for an alternative and relatable superhero that followed only resulted in more disillusionment			2
so many years later , in the year 2015 , it is somewhat bewildering to experience today the same disillusionment when i see so little representation of cultural minorities in popular media			2
this is a big deal to me			2
i am of that school of thought that believes that radio , television , film and other media of popular culture provide the symbols , myths and resources through which we constitute a common culture			2
@entity82 the danger of excluding cultural minorities from popular media is that this limited view starts to paint a constrained picture of what a person should look like , how they should behave and live to the negation of alternative experiences of being human			0
these deliberations are the basis for my graphic novel , " the @entity97			0
" a work in progress , " @entity98 " is set in the near future , on a satellite colony that is located a little off the orbit of mainland @entity31 , and administrated by a corporation			1
@entity105 conformity in the interest of the collective is subliminally reinforced through symbolism and iconology , while the economy is purely corporate - driven			0
exploitation of human by human , and robot by human gives rise to the resistance			0
@entity117 was only 13 years old when she joined the resistance			0
now at 17 , she has recently been appointed as an agent in the @entity120			0
in the ensuing standoff where the @entity123 increasingly maintains control with an ironclad fist it is not long before the resistance galvanizes into a full - blown revolution			0
as the masses are thrust into a state of emergency , @entity117 's world is characterized by curfews , police raids , censorship and propaganda			0
will the revolution overcome ? with this literary and visual offering , i describe a world that is both like -- and at the same time very much unlike -- our own			0
as a young , black female , my protagonist , @entity117 , is the most unlikely hero for the revolution			0
it would , indeed , be accurate to read her as the antithesis of the typical hero who more often than not is male , white , straight and privileged			0
hey , maybe someday the nine - year old version of me can grow up to become a superhero after all			0
