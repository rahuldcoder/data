sen. @entity0 , who is expected to announce on april 7 that he will be running for the presidency , is garnering a great deal of attention as he travels around the country promoting his brand of libertarian conservatism			1
the @entity10 senator 's widely publicized appearance this month at the @entity11 at @entity12 , @entity13 , was one opportunity he used to appeal to a tech - savvy audience			1
his particular blend of ideas -- a combination of libertarianism and @entity21 conservatism -- stands out from the rest of the pack			2
@entity24 , the much - desired millennial vote , seem attracted by what they are hearing			2
what accounts for his appeal ? in an era when so many @entity31 seem frustrated with shallow , personality - based politics , there seems to be genuine interest in a candidate who is fighting for a set of ideas			2
for many disaffected younger republicans , @entity0 offers a version of the conservative agenda that seems foreign to the modern @entity21			1
for almost half a century , " big government conservatism " has ruled the party			2
although conservatism is theoretically about limited government , the historical reality has been much different			2
on national defense , the hawks of the @entity21 have been victorious			0
even while railing against the dangers of a big federal government , republicans have lined up to support higher defense spending and a massive military - industrial complex			2
though the @entity21 has little tolerance for many social safety net programs , the party has accepted sizable government support to industry , such as the financial bailout known as @entity59 in 2008 and subsidies for certain economic interests			0
@entity0 has been a vocal critic of the neoconservative turn that the @entity21 has embraced in recent decades , during which the party moved beyond support for high national security spending and toward a bolder vision of aggressive nation - building and regime change			1
for some republicans , including @entity0 , these policies were at the heart of the failures of @entity74 's presidency and a sharp departure from the party 's principles			1
similarly , @entity0 has been one of the few @entity21 voices to argue that post 9/11 surveillance policies have dangerously curtailed civil liberties			1
at the local level , he has criticized the militarization of police forces and the treatment of @entity31 by law enforcement officers			0
@entity0 has also backed away from some tenets of social conservatism that do n't sit well with a growing number of @entity21 voters			1
he has been an outspoken advocate of giving states the right to legalize marijuana			0
he has been attuned to the ways in which younger generations of @entity24 are not on board with the evangelical fervor of the 1970s conservative movement and want to move in a different direction			2
while many @entity24 have talked about the need for their party to tackle issues involving race and inequality in ways that are different from @entity105 , most have been unwilling to offer any substantive ideas			0
indeed , the recent budget blueprint from congressional @entity24 exposed how thin discussions of a @entity21 anti-poverty program are			0
their budget centers around cuts to key social safety net programs such as @entity112 and regressive supply side tax cuts			0
but @entity0 , who has appeared to be supportive of a stringent budget , has also been willing to put forward bolder ideas , including criminal justice reform , that deal directly with the conditions that have devastated @entity31 communities			1
can @entity0 really win ? that is unclear			1
@entity21 strategist @entity120 told the @entity121 : " it 's one thing to be interesting ; it 's another thing to be compelling			0
they 've got to see him sitting in the @entity125			0
and i do not think @entity0 has crossed that threshold yet			1
" there are many skeptics who do n't think that he has what it takes and that he has a controversial record			0
@entity0 's extremely critical remarks about key aspects of the @entity135 will certainly come back to bite him , as will some of his blistering attacks on the @entity137			1
@entity0 is also trying to make the case for a libertarian conservatism that is not pure			1
@entity0 is still a @entity21 , so he will continue to fit his ideas within the broader agenda of the @entity21			1
he is also a politician at heart and will make compromises that he believes are essential to survive			0
while @entity0 argues that he is trying to take some of the ideas that libertarians liked about his father and make them politically viable , some of his supporters smell a sellout			1
arguably , we have seen this recently when he signed the controversial letter to @entity153 led by sen. @entity154 of @entity155 ( a neoconservative mentored by the hawkish @entity156 ) , switched his approach to the issue of same - sex marriage and gave support to an aggressive war against @entity162			0
" this is more than a flip - flop			0
this is a backflip , " the editor of an anti-war website told the @entity167			0
" this was the last straw			0
i 've put up with a lot from that guy ! i 've had to defend him like a @entity174			2
let somebody else do it			0
" but if @entity0 can sell primary voters that his blend of ideas still offers something distinct from the rest of the @entity21 candidates , at a minimum he can help reshape the debate within the @entity21 by raising questions about some of the party 's core positions .			1

he says the @entity10 senator can appeal to younger republicans with a libertarian brand of conservatism
