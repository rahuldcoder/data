@entity0 is leading a military campaign against @entity4 rebels in @entity5 , bringing the wider region directly into a complex conflict that has festered for months			1
the @entity0 say they want to restore the @entity5 government , a key @entity10 ally in the fight against @entity12 , which was kicked out of the capital by the rebels earlier this year			1
" having @entity5 fail can not be option for us or for our coalition partners , " said @entity15 , the @entity0 ambassador to the @entity10 , referring to the other nations in the region supporting the campaign			1
here are answers to key questions about the escalating conflict in @entity5			1
analysts say it can be summed up in one word : @entity27			1
the @entity0 " perceive this as a threat from the @entity27 , " said @entity1 military analyst lt. col. @entity28			1
" they look at the @entity32 as nothing more than a proxy @entity27 force , just like we can look at @entity36 as a proxy @entity27 force in southern @entity38			1
" analysts say that @entity4 - majority @entity27 and @entity40 - dominated @entity0 are locked in a strategic contest for influence across the @entity43			1
now , the epic chess match has spread into @entity5 , @entity0 's southern neighbor			1
" what they do not want is an @entity27 - run state on their southern border , because they already feel they 've got enough problems on their northern border , " said @entity28 , a retired @entity10 @entity45 intelligence officer			1
@entity27 , northeast of @entity0 , is considered to exercise powerful influence within the regime of president @entity57 in war - torn @entity58 and within the @entity4 - led @entity61 government			1
the @entity0 and other @entity63 nations appeared to make an implicit reference to @entity27 in a statement about the start of the military campaign , describing the @entity69 militias as " backed by regional powers " that are aiming for " hegemony " in @entity5			1
the @entity27 government , for its part , condemned the offensive , calling for an immediate halt to @entity0 - led airstrikes , state media reported			1
the chaos in @entity5 appeared to be careering toward a full - blown civil war			1
the @entity32 , whose power base is in northern @entity5 , started protests against the central government in the capital , @entity86 , last summer			1
but they stepped up their campaign in september , seizing multiple government buildings			0
attempts to strike political deals between the two sides had no effect , and the @entity32 pushed into other areas of the country			0
the crisis intensified in january , when the @entity32 displayed their clout by storming the presidential palace and putting president @entity98 under house arrest			0
@entity98 escaped to the southern city of @entity101 in february and declared that he remained the legitimate president			0
since then , @entity98 's supporters have repeatedly clashed with the @entity32 and their allies , prompting the @entity105 to warn of an impending civil war			1
the @entity32 also have support from forces loyal to @entity98 's predecessor , former president @entity109 , who resigned in 2012 after months of @entity111 - inspired protests			0
the deepening chaos has led many governments to pull embassy staff out of @entity86			0
the @entity10 recently withdrew its remaining special forces in @entity5 , dealing a blow to counterterrorism efforts in the country			1
rebel forces captured parts of @entity101 and a nearby airbase wednesday			0
early thursday , the @entity0 - led strikes began			2
the airstrikes appear to be only the start of the campaign			0
@entity0 has also pledged 150,000 soldiers to the coalition that 's intervening in @entity5 , the @entity0 - owned @entity126 reported thursday , raising the possibility of a ground offensive			1
" the airstrikes will be the kickoff of the campaign , " @entity28 said " they 'll want to knock down the air defenses and create a corridor with which they can move their troops in there			0
" it was n't immediately clear if other nations in the coalition were offering any ground troops			0
a ground offensive is n't a decision that @entity0 king @entity144 would take lightly			2
" @entity0 , all these years , has avoided sending troops into @entity5			1
it 's a quagmire for the @entity0 , " @entity1 intelligence and security analyst @entity146 said in january			2
beyond the military campaign , the @entity0 and their allies say they want to find a political solution for the violence - plagued nation			2
the aim is to bring back @entity5 's " security and stability through establishing a political process , " said a statement from @entity0 , the @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162			1
@entity163 , the @entity0 ambassador to the @entity10 , said @entity10 forces are not involved in the airstrikes			2
but @entity28 said he thought the @entity10 most likely assisted with information needed to pick out targets			0
" the @entity0 do n't have the intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance capability to determine all of these targets , " he said			2
" they 've had to have had some help , and i think it probably came from us			0
" @entity176 and senior @entity175 administration officials tell @entity1 that an interagency @entity10 coordination team is in @entity0			2
the sources said the @entity0 have not specified what they want yet , but will probably ask for @entity10 air support , satellite imagery and other intelligence			2
" we can help with logistics and intelligence and things like that , but there will be no military intervention by the @entity10 , " a senior administration official said			0
a @entity0 adviser told @entity1 that 10 countries are involved in the coalition : @entity0 , the @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity197			2
but it was unclear how many of those countries other than @entity0 were taking an active military role			2
the @entity0 adviser told @entity1 that the @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity162 and @entity161 had contributed fighter planes to the operations			2
it brings another disturbing angle to the conflict			0
@entity5 is home to @entity205 , considered by @entity10 officials to be the most dangerous branch of the terrorist network			0
the @entity210 extremist group , also known as @entity205 , has taken advantage of @entity5 's weak government to plan and launch terrorist attacks against the @entity214			0
operating from its heartland in central @entity5 , it considers both the @entity32 and the pro- @entity10 @entity5 government as its foes			0
@entity69 forces have clashed with @entity205 and its allies in central @entity5			1
and bomb attacks have repeatedly hit @entity4 gatherings in the capital			0
there are also concerns about @entity226 ' growing influence in @entity5			0
the @entity40 militant group that controls large areas of @entity61 and @entity58 claimed responsibility for attacks on @entity4 mosques in @entity86 that killed more than 130 people this month			0
@entity205 and @entity226 looked set to be " the big winners " from the deepening chaos in @entity5 , @entity1 terrorism analyst @entity235 said wednesday before news of the @entity0 airstrikes emerged			1
but the big question now is whether the @entity0 - led coalition will take any action against the @entity40 terrorist groups			0
@entity1 's @entity242 contributed to this report .			0

@entity0 sees @entity69 rebels in @entity5 as a proxy for @entity27 , analysts say
the @entity0 act as @entity5 *teeters* on the brink of civil war
