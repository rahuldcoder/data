@entity2 , @entity3 @entity0 grins as he recalls being mobbed by a boisterous crowd chanting his name at a @entity3 airport arrivals hall in the early summer of 2014			1
" it was very nice ... a good surprise for me , " he said , wistfully casting his mind back to images of football fans waving flags and hollering his name			2
the graceful @entity17 midfielder once of @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 has become used to such fevered adulation over the years			1
a glittering decade playing in @entity22 brought @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity26 titles and , of course , a devoted following			2
but it was n't the loyal apostles of @entity20 's @entity31 , the @entity32 or even his compatriots in the unmistakeable yellow of a @entity36 with whom he won a @entity39 in 2002 that provided the heroes welcome in question			1
instead it was a passionate crowd festooned in the less heralded purple and white of @entity45 , one of the newest franchises in @entity48			1
only founded in 2010 , the team will make its mls bow this week			2
but interest was high that a former @entity52 winner would be coming to play his football in a place more commonly associated with @entity56 and @entity57			2
local news stations carried live pictures of @entity0 's plane touching down			1
leaving the airport to officially sign his contract even became a mission in itself , so keen were the @entity2 natives to get a glimpse of their first designated signing			2
" when i arrived in the airport , this crowd ( was ) singing the team songs , singing my name			2
also ( at ) my presentation downtown , i was very , very happy , " @entity0 said			1
" now , the city is start ( ing ) to enjoy this moment and everybody 's looking forward to our , first game on march 8			0
" such frenzied devotion in the @entity81 , so long resistant to the charms of the world 's most popular sport , may seem strange to fans in @entity22 and @entity86 , football 's historical and cultural heartlands			0
the @entity48 is now approaching its 20th season but has long been pejoratively regarded outside @entity90 as a retirement home for once top - level players -- a plastic , commercially driven product devoid of any real identity offering one last payday before the limbs give out			1
aged 32 and no doubt the recipient of a handsome remuneration package , there will be many who question whether @entity0 is merely jetting in to boost his bank balance before calling it a day			1
relaxed and polite as ever , @entity0 himself is having none of this			1
in all honesty , it 's hard to imagine a man as conscientious and clearly committed to his faith moving anywhere solely for the money			0
there was once a time when every @entity0 goal resulted in a lifting of his jersey to reveal a t - shirt which stated " @entity120 loves you " or " i belong to @entity120			1
" these days , the celebration of choice is usually the upward point and grateful look to the heavens			0
" in every moment of my life , not just on the field , but also off the field , my faith , @entity120 and the bible helped me a lot			0
" so every time that i can i do my prayer , i read the bible , go to the church			0
these things help me a lot to stay in good peace on my mind			0
" his faith was never more important than as an 18 - year - old in @entity18 when he suffered a serious neck injury			2
" all the doctors said look you are lucky to walk in this moment , so you need to be happy you can walk , " he said			0
" and my question was ' but i can play ? ' everybody said ' we do n't know , we have to wait			2
' so , in that moment , the faith helped me a lot			0
" @entity152 always supported me at every moment and after two months i start to play as a professional player			2
it was a very important moment of my life			0
" talking of moments , @entity0 describes how moving to the @entity81 was always a long - term ambition			1
upon meeting @entity45 majority owner @entity160 in @entity161 a number of years ago , the pair discussed the potential of working together			1
moves to @entity165 and @entity166 were mooted in the interim but never materialized for various reasons			0
it was then the @entity2 opportunity arose which he was only too happy to take			0
@entity0 points to other high - profile players like @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 being attracted to the league as proof of its appeal and progress			1
" there 's a lot of good players that could have another team in @entity22 but they chose to come here			0
i think it 's a good moment to be in this league			0
in a few years , we will listen a lot about the @entity48 , " he said			1
he might just have a point			0
the forthcoming @entity48 season marks the first of a new eight - year tv deal and media rights partnership with @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196			1
on top of this , average attendance across the league for the 2014 season was the highest in recent @entity48 history , according to data on the @entity205 blog			1
yet questions remain over the long - term profitability of some teams			2
a report from @entity210 in late 2013 found only 10 out of 19 @entity48 franchises were making any money			1
critics might also argue that the players mentioned by @entity0 are past their very best with the possible exception of the 28 - year - old @entity175			1
unsurprisingly , the former @entity217 does n't see it that we way			0
he reveals he still harbors ambitions of continuing his international career and even making the @entity39 in @entity223 2018			1
last october saw a surprise recall under returning @entity161 manager , @entity225			0
" i have a three - year contract with @entity2 , and at least these three			2
in four years , we have another @entity39 , " said @entity0 , who will be 36 in 2018			1
" if i feel good and @entity161 needs me ( it ) will be a good way to stop playing			0
so i hope i can play another @entity39			1
" just mentioning the @entity39 in the presence of a @entity17 can be tense after the trauma of last year 's incredible semifinal in @entity233			1
the 7 - 1 home - turf mauling at the hands of eventual winners @entity237 was variously described in the unforgiving @entity17 press at the time as " an historic humiliation " and the " humiliation of all humiliations			2
" never before has a @entity17 side looked so inept , so fragile , so lacking in class , flair or bereft of that ephemeral quality known locally as " joga bonito			0
" " that was very hard for us , " said @entity0 even though he was n't selected for the tournament			1
" that defeat in our country , in the semifinal @entity39 it 's very , very difficult			1
but i think we can use this to change some in the @entity17 football			0
" a lot of players play outside ( of @entity161 )			2
most of them play in @entity22 , but we have to change something organization in the soccer in @entity161			2
" for me , the most important thing is the organization and the calendar			0
it 's a lot of games , so the players ca n't play every game in a good shape			2
" the level is a little bit down in this moment			0
also , the youth team is not what ( we 're ) used to being in @entity161 , so we need to wake up			0
" @entity0 hopes that many of his compatriots will keep up with the @entity48 and his career in @entity2 now that he 's exhibiting his much admired talents there			1
" we have a @entity281 page in @entity161 , @entity161 , and a lot of fans ( are ) enjoying the page			0
a lot of @entity17 are looking here now , " he said			0
" i think this season will be great for us in @entity161			0
a lot of people will see the @entity45 playing in @entity48			1
" and despite earlier talk of an extended international career and making @entity39 2018 , there really is only one goal at the forefront of his mind			1
" my goal is always to win			0
i hope one day i can win the league with @entity45 , " he said			1
" for this year , probably we want to arrive in the playoffs			0
let 's put the target a little bit down , but i still have ... this goal that we can win the league one day			0
