day 's work and finds no hot dinner on the table			2
he snaps , lashing out ( allegedly ) at the nearest underling who could be held responsible			2
within days , almost 1 million people sign a petition for him not to lose his job , while the suspension of the tv program he presents loses the @entity17 4 million viewers			1
why is this man so popular that he can be accused of abusing his staff ( not to mention members of other ethnic groups and nationalities ) and seemingly get away with it ? a serial offender , @entity25 seems to enjoy a charmed life			1
but , with the @entity17 now deliberating over his future , has his luck finally run out ? not a chance			1
@entity25 , like so many celebrities , sees his stock grow with every controversy			1
every indiscretion seems calculated to raise his profile and boost his esteem among his fervent followers that little bit further			0
the " @entity52 " incident , which saw the n - word slip out -- whoops , did i really hear what i think i heard ? -- was designed to achieve just the right effect : offensive enough to generate howls of protest , but trivial enough for his fans to spring to his defense , crying " over-reaction " and " storm in a teacup			2
" the presenter later apologized , saying his efforts to obscure the offending word " were n't quite good enough			2
" on this latest occasion , was it the beleaguered producer lodging a complaint , or , like any normal person who 's been punched in the face by a thug , pressing charges with the local constabulary ? no , it was none other than @entity25 who willingly gave himself up to the corporation			1
go on , sack me , he seemed to be saying , when he told a reporter that his dismissal " is coming , is n't it ? " see how my adoring public likes that			0
former @entity76 prime minister @entity75 and @entity78 manager @entity77 are , like @entity25 , seasoned experts in rebranding themselves ( or their team ) as the victims , even when they seem to have everything going for them bar the position of the stars			1
they have all perfected the glum , hangdog expression that invites sympathy , begging forgiveness for each misdemeanour			0
it makes their success all the sweeter if they can convince us that they achieved it in the face of hostility			0
while waiting for the @entity17 to deliver its verdict , @entity25 penned an article for @entity100 in which he likened himself to a " dinosaur " whose time is about to run out , knowing full well that his followers will protest : no , of course you 're not washed up and irrelevant , @entity25			1
@entity105 needs you to stand up to @entity107 ! it is almost tempting to wonder whether there might be a political role ahead of him should the @entity17 decide to give him the push for once and for all ( i use the word " political " advisedly here )			1
the @entity117 had a goddess , @entity118 , who fanfared both good and bad deeds for all eternity			0
badly behaved celebrities have their trumpets blown by the massed forces of the media , which are of course only too pleased to have such good copy			2
@entity25 is already assured of immortality , if only through @entity132 or its futuristic equivalent , but while waiting to shuffle off this mortal coil he -- like all celebrities -- acts as a conduit of divinity			1
he is the chain that binds the earthly audience to the goddess @entity137 , and this is why we allow him to act in such a beastly way , without complaining ( too much )			0
in the east of @entity143 , holy intermediaries called @entity144 beat devotees with canes			0
the devotees flinch with the mortal pain , but they receive it as a blessing			0
contestants on the @entity152 queue all night for the opportunity to be verbally abused by @entity154			0
bruises , actual and emotional , are worn with pride , whether delivered by the @entity158 cane , @entity154 's tongue , or @entity25 's fist ( allegedly )			1
they are blessed that are touched by celebrity			0
so how about @entity164 , @entity25 's hapless producer , who , according to the @entity165 , had to seek hospital treatment for a cut lip following the " fracas ? " had he presented poor , weary @entity169 with a nice succulent steak on his arrival that evening , he would still be languishing in the realms of the unknown			1
and do n't feel sorry for the hotel owner either : just watch bookings at @entity175 , the @entity177 hotel where the alleged incident took place , go through the roof			0
they may as well start engraving that blue plaque now .			0

@entity184 @entity25 allegedly lashed out a producer , *prompting* @entity17 to cancel broadcast of program
@entity25 , like so many celebrities , sees his stock grow with every controversy , says @entity192
@entity25 is already assured of immortality , says @entity192 , adding that like all celebrities -- the presenter acts as conduit of divinity
