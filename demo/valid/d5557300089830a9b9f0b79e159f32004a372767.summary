@entity1 astronaut @entity0 has started a trip to the record books			1
he plans to spend 342 days on the @entity5 -- the longest stretch of time any @entity8 astronaut has spent in space			1
@entity0 lifted off friday aboard a @entity11 soyuz rocket that launched from @entity12			1
the rocket docked at the @entity5 at 9:33 p.m. et , according to a tweet from @entity1 , with hatches between the @entity16 and the space station scheduled to open about 11:15 p.m. et. @entity0 will stay twice as long as any @entity8 astronaut has ever stayed on the space station , giving scientists a chance to study how the human body responds to long - duration space flights			1
on @entity25 , scientists will perform parallel studies on @entity0 's identical twin brother , retired astronaut @entity27			1
" it 's a lot of fun , " @entity0 said at a media briefing in january			1
" space station is a magical place			0
" two cosmonauts are riding up with @entity0 : @entity34 and @entity35			1
@entity34 also will stay up for a year			2
@entity35 will only stay up for six months			1
the trio will join three crew members already on the space station : @entity8 astronaut @entity39 , @entity11 cosmonaut @entity40 and @entity42 astronaut @entity41			1
other crew members also will rotate in and out during their year in orbit so it will never be just @entity0 and @entity34 on the station			1
@entity0 , 51 , hopes to break the record for the longest mission on the space station set by @entity1 astronaut @entity50 and @entity11 cosmonaut @entity51			1
they spent over seven months on the @entity5 -- from september 18 , 2006 , to april 21 , 2007			2
he is expected to spend 342 days off the planet on this mission			0
when added to his previous space missions , that would give him a total of 522 days in space , breaking the record of @entity8 astronaut @entity59			2
@entity59 spent a combined 381 days , 15 hours and 11 minutes in space , according to his official @entity1 bio			0
while @entity0 shoots to set space station and other @entity8 records , @entity35 is on schedule to set a record for the most total time in space for a human			1
he 's already spent more than 710 days in space , including stays on @entity11 's @entity69 and three previous stints on the @entity5			1
why do it ? why stay up on the station so long ? @entity1 wants to know more about the impact of long - duration spaceflights on the human body to help plan missions to @entity77 and deeper into space			1
and the space station , in orbit 250 miles above @entity25 , is the best place available to study that			0
spending that much time in a weightless environment will take a toll			0
@entity1 says space station astronauts have vision changes , bone loss , muscle atrophy and other problems			0
@entity1 says the experiments should have benefits on @entity25 , such as helping patients recover from long periods of bed rest to improved monitoring of people whose bodies are unable to fight infections			0
the space station has about the same living space as a six - bedroom , two bathroom house			0
and it has a 360 - degree bay window with a great view			0
but astronauts and cosmonauts still report feeling isolated and confined at times			0
@entity0 will document his feelings about being away from his two children and the rest of his family			2
" i 'm going to keep a personal journal of the experience , " @entity0 said			2
he also will share some of his journal with researchers studying the psychological impacts of long - term space flight			0
will he tell all ? " i plan to be completely honest about it , " he said , but ... " who knows , maybe there are some crazy thoughts i 'll have at the end that i would n't want to share			0
" @entity27 has volunteered for @entity1 's " @entity123 " to see how the identical twins change over the year in two very different environments			0
he is the husband of former @entity8 rep. @entity126 of @entity127 , who left office after being wounded in a january 2011 assassination attempt			0
" he thinks it 's great that he can still be a participant in this , " @entity0 said			2
so @entity27 will be on @entity25 getting poked and prodded by researchers -- while @entity0 makes history in orbit			2
final candidates announced for one - way trip to @entity77			0

@entity0 aims to set a record for longest stay on the @entity5
@entity11 cosmonaut @entity35 will add to his all - time human spaceflight record
