@entity0 was supposed to arrive home from work on a friday evening in february			0
but he never again pulled into the driveway of the home in suburban @entity6 where he lived with his wife and four children			1
the 31 - year - old welder died that night after a police officer shot him twice in the chest			1
@entity0 was unarmed , but in early reports about the shooting , police said an altercation erupted after he disobeyed an officer 's commands during a traffic stop			1
it was n't until hours after the shooting that his wife says she got a call from police , telling her what had happened			2
now , questions swirl through @entity28 's mind			2
how will their children grow up without a father ? will authorities take the case seriously or toss it aside because of her husband 's immigration status and the fact that the man who opened fire was a police officer , not a civilian ? and what happened that night to make something so horrible happen ? " if my husband had killed a police officer , he would be in jail , " she said			1
" but since it was the opposite , will they just leave it this way ? because an officer killed a man , because he killed an illegal and nothing more ? what are a human 's rights then ? now an animal gets more rights than a man			1
" @entity0 is one of three @entity62 nationals killed in @entity64 police shootings in the past month , sparking sharp criticism from @entity62 's @entity66 and a call for the @entity68 to investigate			1
pressure for authorities to take a deeper look at the controversial case is also coming from north of the border			1
at a @entity75 meeting in @entity76 , @entity77 , last week , @entity28 and her children were among a group holding signs that said " @entity80 " and chanting , " hands up ! do n't shoot ! " -- the phrase that started as a call to action after the shooting death of @entity85 in @entity86 , @entity87 , and has now become a rallying cry across the country in protests against police violence			2
police said it 's too soon to say exactly what happened that night			1
investigators have interviewed dozens of witnesses and plan to share their findings with prosecutors			0
no charges have been filed			0
" i do not know now whether to believe in the authorities here or not , " @entity28 said , " because if a police officer acted like this , what can another official do ? i do n't know			1
i want to trust them , because they are the ones who are taking care of us in this city			0
but i do n't know what they can do			0
" the case already has one piece of evidence that was n't available to investigators looking into @entity85 's death : a police cruiser dash cam video			1
but police have n't released it to the public			2
" there will be more information released as the investigation continues			2
this additional information may shed more light on mr. @entity0 's actions that night , " police and city officials in @entity76 said last week			1
" we look forward to the time that the community can review the dash cam video of this incident , which we believe will answer many questions and correct some misconceptions about this incident			0
" @entity0 's family members said they 've seen the video , and even though it does n't show the shooting , they said it 's clear there was no good reason for the officer to open fire			1
@entity0 was unarmed , they said , had his hands in the air and did nothing to threaten the officer who stopped him			2
it all started , police say , when a burglar alarm went off february 20 at a business in @entity76			2
officer @entity156 of the @entity157 spotted @entity0 's car in the area and started to follow him			1
soon , according to police , the pursuit turned into a high - speed chase , with the officer following @entity0 from @entity76 into the neighboring town of @entity165 , @entity77			1
a @entity167 statement released after the shooting said the dash cam video shows @entity0 's car " weaving through and around the heavy traffic and driving onto the highway attempting to evade officer @entity156			1
" eventually , @entity0 pulled over			0
his family said they believe he did n't stop for police right away because he was scared			2
he was an undocumented immigrant who had lived in the @entity64 for 15 years and he knew any encounter with police could end with him getting deported and separated from his children , @entity28 said			2
@entity64 president @entity181 's announcement last fall that undocumented immigrant parents of @entity64 citizen children could be eligible for work permits as part of a new executive action gave them hope , but also made them even more nervous about making sure they steered clear of trouble until the paperwork came through , she said			2
he knew that to have problems with the authorities was serious			2
... we could n't have a criminal record , " she said			0
" that is what he had in mind			0
what is going to happen to me now ? now i am not going to be ok			0
they are going to deport me			0
" @entity204 said it was jarring to hear what @entity0 says in the video as he gets out of the vehicle			0
" my brother - in - law is out of the car with his hands up , " he said , " and the first thing he asks is , ' are you going to kill me ? ' " there 's no sound of any fighting or altercation , but what you do hear , he said , is the profanities the officer repeatedly shouts as @entity0 approaches with his hands up			1
it 's hard to hear exactly what was said , according to @entity28 ; the family believes the officer made a comment claiming @entity0 was drunk			1
police in @entity165 , who are leading the criminal investigation into what happened , told @entity1 the video does contain foul language			1
the @entity167 dispute the family 's assertion that @entity0 did nothing threatening , saying that " contrary to clear instructions " he continued to walk toward the officer after being told repeatedly to stop			1
but there 's a key thing that 's not shown on the video , police and the family said : the shooting itself			1
still , @entity204 said the sound of gunshots is clear , piercing through the roar of rush - hour traffic			0
his sister , @entity0 's widow , was so devastated after seeing the video he had to carry her out of the police station			1
@entity167 said the video shows the officer did everything he could to keep the situation under control until backup arrived			2
" we believe the dash - cam video , as well as information that has already been in the media , clearly demonstrates that officer @entity156 was doing everything in his power , including the use of strong language , to keep mr. @entity0 at a safe distance until backup arrived and an arrest [ was ] safely accomplished , " sgt. @entity258 said in a written statement released thursday			2
" members of the media have also been diligent in reporting some of the possible explanations for mr. @entity0 's actions on the night of february 20 , including a previous high - speed chase and a prior arrest for @entity278 , and a fear that he would be deported			0
officer @entity156 had no way of knowing mr. @entity0 's nationality at the time the traffic stop was initiated and it may not have been evident on a highway in the late evening			1
" @entity28 said her husband made a mistake when he did n't stop when the officer tried to pull him over			0
but she said he was trying to cooperate and turn himself in			0
" he was painted like a criminal who was involved in a robbery and had assaulted an officer , and in the video you do n't see any of those things , " she said			0
" you see the opposite , a man who is scared , who is simply trying to calm the situation , who sees that the police officer has a weapon in his hands			1
" now she said , she 's seeking justice , hoping the police officer will face the appropriate charges for killing her husband			1
but she knows the family 's search for answers wo n't be easy			0
in addition to the doubts swirling in her head , she is faced with questions from her children , even as she tries to explain to them that their father wo n't return			0
the most devastating of all , she said , is , " @entity316 , when is my @entity317 going to wake up ? " police in @entity165 said they 're also asking plenty of questions			0
investigators have interviewed more than two dozen witnesses and are searching for more people who might have seen what happened , @entity318 lt. @entity321 said @entity156 , who 's worked for the @entity167 since may 2014 , is on administrative leave pending the investigation			1
@entity167 did not respond to @entity1 's request to speak to @entity156 about the incident			0
the burglar alarm that spurred the officer 's initial response , police later said , turned out to be false			1
as for the video , @entity167 said they still want the public to see it , but for now , they 're holding off on releasing it because prosecutors have asked for evidence not to be released to the public while an investigation is pending			0
" while we understand the interest of the community in the requests to release the video , we must balance those needs with the direction from the @entity349 and the respect for the judicial process , " police said thursday			0
" we recognize that much of the sentiment being expressed is based on the understandable grief concerning mr. @entity0 's death			0
we appreciate the support of our citizens and the fact that they are keeping an open mind and waiting for the results of a complete and thorough investigation			0
" @entity1 's @entity361 and @entity362 contributed to this report .			0

a police officer shot and killed @entity366 in a @entity6 suburb
the case has drawn sharp criticism from @entity62 's government , which calls for a *federal* investigation
