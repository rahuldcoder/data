from the sweltering heat of the @entity4 to the subzero temperatures at both @entity6 , @entity1 ' running obsession knows no bounds			1
dubbed the " @entity9 , " the record - breaking runner has completed more than 50 marathons and ultramarathons , but she remains determinedly modest about her feats			1
" i do n't keep my medals , i do n't know where they are			2
i do n't have trophies -- people have cabinets of trophies -- the dogs have chewed most of mine , " @entity1 told @entity2 's @entity17 series			1
" i do n't have cuttings from newspapers ... i 'm not interested			2
i would never say to people : ' i am this ' or ' i am that ' -- it 's not something that i 'm predisposed to shout about			2
i do n't think i 'm very special at all , to be honest			2
" perhaps the 48 - year - old needs to rethink her definition of special given her punishing schedule is religiously maintained despite her suffering from a potentially crippling knee complaint -- a legacy of reconstructive surgery during her teens			1
" i had a tumor ( in my right knee ) when i was 14 years old , it was n't discovered until i was 17 , by which time i had lost an awful lot of weight -- i think i weighed around five stone , " she explains			1
" in the end i had radical surgery to remove the kneecap and knee joint			1
it was in plaster for about three years			2
i was told that i would n't walk properly again , let alone do anything like running			2
it 's painful when i run , but i can manage it because i know what to expect			2
" @entity1 started running properly just over a decade ago and soon found her stride , winning her first half - marathon in a course - record time before stepping up to compete over 26.2 miles and beyond			1
today , she routinely finishes conventional marathons in around two hours , 50 minutes and has a personal best of two hours , 38 minutes -- a shade over the a standard required to qualify for the @entity60			1
when she 's not pounding the tarmac in city marathons , @entity1 competes in some of the world 's toughest endurance races counting the @entity65 in @entity67 's @entity66 -- an 150 - mile ultramarathon run at altitudes in excess of 4,400 meters ( 14,600 feet ) -- and the similarly challenging @entity71 where competitors run six marathons in six days through the @entity4 among her conquests			1
she still winces at the memory of competing in that 154 - mile @entity77 event , dubbed the world 's toughest footrace			1
" @entity80 in 2012 was appallingly tough			2
the week before i went i broke two toes -- a horse stood on my foot			2
" trying to complete the @entity71 is a tough ask , but trying to complete it with broken toes was brutal			0
for the whole week i lived on painkillers ... it was just appalling , but it did toughen me up , " she says			0
the following year , @entity1 broke three world records becoming the fastest woman to run a marathon on each continent -- clocking an aggregate time of 26 hours , 18 minutes and 43 seconds -- as well as recording the fastest aggregate and elapsed times for running marathons on all seven continents plus the @entity98 -- a place she remembers warmly			1
" i think my favorite marathon has to be the @entity98 , purely because it 's a marathon on the top of the world			0
it 's such an unrealistic place to be actually running a marathon , and also i caught a glimpse of a polar bear -- which has to be one of the highlights of my life			0
" there is no let up in her schedule when she 's crosses the finish line -- once she 's got her breath back it 's straight back to the day job running an animal sanctuary at her home in @entity118 , @entity119			1
with 400 animals including horses , pigs , sheep and dogs to care for around the clock as well as keeping up her training routine of 100 miles every week , it 's no surprise that @entity1 has little time for anything else			1
" my life is very , very regimented , it 's hard to fit in the running around caring for the animals			0
i have to get up at 3.30 in the morning and i work through till probably nine or 10 o'clock at night , " she says			0
" people forget that if you train for something very , very hard it has a detrimental effect on the people around you			0
i have no personal or family life			0
every minute of my time that is not spent caring for my animals is spent dedicated to running			0
" it might be that whenever someone else is having a @entity146 day lunch , i 'm putting my running shoes and going out to run 30 miles			0
" running has helped her raise money for the animal sanctuary and also allowed her to promote a positive image of veganism , though @entity1 , who has n't eaten animal products since her teenage years , is keen not to sound too preachy			1
" i do n't like to dwell on the vegan thing because ( you ) quickly gets marked as some sort of fruitcake or an animal rights extremist and i do n't want to appear to be telling people what to do -- it 's a personal thing , " she says			1
but she can not deny feeling a deep sense of satisfaction about helping change the perception that vegans somehow lack energy because of their diet			2
" i became so frustrated by constantly being told you ca n't do ( running ) as a vegan ( and that ) vegans are weak , vegans will keel over if they try to do something extreme			0
i wanted to prove my point			0
" i just want to be an example to say that if these people are considering this lifestyle , it can be done on a plant - based diet			1
" as if to hammer home her point , @entity1 recently attempted to run seven marathons in seven days on seven continents -- running in a " cow costume " to raise awareness of animal cruelty			1
her hopes of completing the @entity187 were dashed at the last though when poor weather prevented her flying from @entity67 to @entity189 to complete the final leg of the race			0
" it was really devastating at the finish , but i could n't wait , i had to come home for the animals			0
i 'm not at an extendable budget with time so i had to leave , " she said			0
next month , @entity1 will be off on her travels again , returning to @entity197 to compete in her third @entity71 , before heading back onto the road to compete at the @entity199 later in the year where she aims to better her 17th - place finish achieved in 2006			1
" i 'm always focusing on what i 'm about to do next , " she says , before quietly conceding running is n't always her favorite activity			0
" i do n't particularly enjoy running			0
the training is extremely difficult and i do push to the absolute limits			0
i enjoy the results that are achieved from the running ... i like to take on challenges that would be almost impossible and prove that i can do it			0
