" @entity0 , which never orders anything without a reason , forbids every beast to eat man			0
" i still remember the first time i read the passage from " @entity9 , " heart racing beneath my pajamas covered with @entity4			0
" the real reason for this is that man - killing means , sooner or later , the arrival of white men on elephants , with guns , and hundreds of brown men with gongs , rockets and torches			2
then everybody in the jungle suffers , " @entity23 wrote			0
i probably understood that tiger attacks were fairly rare in @entity27 , but to my 11 - year - old brain , @entity23 was dropping wisdom that just might keep me alive on the next expedition into the weedy lot behind @entity32			1
" the reason the beasts give among themselves is that @entity4 is the weakest and most defenseless of all living things , and it is unsportsmanlike to touch him			0
" reading that passage 35 years later , while rolling through the very forest that inspired the classic , the irony in that line finally clicks			0
when we hear the woof of a frightened deer and my guide kills the engine , my grown - up heart pounds once again			2
it is a sign that there may be big cats nearby			1
" i wonder who will be the last person to see a tiger in the wild ? and are they alive today ? " these are the questions that launched this stop on " @entity59 , " and they led us to a much bigger question about life in the 21st century : is the planet still big enough for man and man - eater ? @entity68 is about one - third the size of the continental @entity70 , with four times as many people			1
that kind of human pressure has changed @entity23 's " @entity0 " in dramatic ways			2
according to the animal conservation group @entity77 , there are more tigers in cages in @entity80 than in the forests of @entity68			1
so i set out to understand how and why			0
having covered the poaching of @entity85 animals to feed the huge market for @entity88 medicine , i assumed the demand for tiger - skin rugs in @entity91 or tiger - bone wine in @entity93 would be the biggest threat to this endangered cat			1
can tigers claw their way back from the brink ? but it turns out that tiger - human conflict is a much bigger problem			1
almost half a billion rural @entity68 have no plumbing and answer nature 's call by squatting in the forest			2
most tiger attacks happen when these people are mistaken for prey , and most tiger kills come in the angry hours that follow , as friends and neighbors of the victim seek revenge			2
and so , a new specialty in conservation is the art of tiger conflict mediation			1
it is not easy to convince a frightened farmer that the cat that ate his cow is more valuable alive than caged or dead			0
but these efforts , along with a more pointed anti-poaching campaign , seem to be paying off			0
the latest tiger census counted 2,226 big cats in @entity68 , a 30 % increase over the previous count in 2011			1
if the estimates hold , this would make @entity68 the only country in the world with a growing tiger population			1
but the human population is growing much faster			0
maintaining a healthy population of apex predators is just one new challenge on a planet that will welcome a couple billion more people in just the next generation			0
you 'll be surprised by the others as we seek @entity68 's magnificent treasures -- both natural and man - made -- on the next episode of " @entity59			1

there are more tigers in cages in @entity80 than in the wild in @entity68 , a conservation group says
tiger - human conflict is a major problem affecting the big cats
