the terror that came to @entity2 on wednesday -- the deadliest attack on tourists in the @entity6 world since the 1997 massacre in @entity8 , @entity9 -- was a long time coming			1
@entity2 has been widely seen as the only success story of the @entity11 with a new progressive constitution , a freely elected secular president and prime minister , and a moderate @entity16 opposition so far committed to democratic principles			1
but economic progress has lagged well behind			1
high unemployment has created frustrations among the young and a significant number have looked for answers in radical @entity23			0
political opening in @entity2 has given radicals more breathing room , their numbers swollen by the release hardened @entity16 militants during the 2011 @entity2 revolution that swept away decades of autocratic rule			1
one of those who was freed from jail was @entity34 -- also known as @entity35 -- a veteran @entity2 jihadi who worked with @entity38 in @entity39 in the 1990s and founded the @entity41 group			1
soon after he was released he founded @entity42 in @entity2 , a @entity44 movement which has up to 40,000 followers			1
the group has a similar outlook to its namesake in @entity48 which the @entity49 says carried out the attack on the @entity49 @entity51 in @entity52 on september 11 , 2012 , and according to @entity54 , a terrorism expert at @entity55 , there are real and fluid links between the two groups			0
three days after the @entity59 attack , @entity42 in @entity2 organized a mob attack outside the @entity61 in @entity2 which put @entity49 lives at risk			1
according to the @entity49 government , the group has also been responsible for several other attacks , including attempted suicide bombings at @entity2 tourist destinations			1
in october 2013 , a @entity2 suicide bomber blew himself up outside a beach hotel in @entity70 , killing only himself			1
another was arrested in @entity72 before he could blow up his device			0
the two had reportedly tried to travel to @entity75 but had been persuaded enroute by @entity76 in @entity48 to bring @entity77 home			0
in 2013 two secular @entity2 politicians were assassinated by @entity16 extremists			1
the @entity49 said @entity42 was implicated in the attacks			0
in the last two years , @entity2 security forces have increasingly cracked down on @entity42 , but the movement still has a significant following			1
@entity85 fled to @entity48 where he is now believed to be based			0
the @entity77 has been the single biggest factor in the worsening security situation in @entity2			1
over 3000 @entity2 have flocked to fight @entity77 in @entity75 and @entity88 , many of them joining @entity90			1
and about 500 are believed to have returned stretching the resources of security services			0
in december 2014 @entity90 released a video calling on @entity2 to pledge allegiance to @entity90 and carry out attacks , including assassinations			1
the @entity98 museum attack took place just days after a @entity100 tweeted that a pledge of allegiance by @entity76 to @entity90 leader @entity102 was coming soon , according to the site intelligence group			0
the @entity2 jihadi who posted the message sunday claimed to belong to " @entity108 in @entity2			1
" in december , a grouping by the same name had pledged allegiance to @entity90			0
but the earlier pledge appears not to have fully registered with @entity90			0
an @entity90 fighter in @entity113 , recently appeared in a video questioning why @entity115 in @entity2 had not pledged fealty			1
the @entity100 replied " wait for the glad tidings of what will bring you joy			0
... the delay of the public pledge of allegiance was for the sake of preparation			0
" the statement raises the possibility that the museum attack could be @entity90 's debut on the @entity2 stage , timed to precede a pledge of allegiance from @entity132 for maximum impact			2
while @entity136 twitter accounts lit up in celebration after the museum attack , there had been no credible claims of responsibility as of late wednesday			0
@entity2 security officials are worried about spillover from an increasingly chaotic @entity48			2
@entity90 has taken advantage of a simmering civil war in @entity2 's neighbor to rapidly expand			2
it is now the dominant force in @entity147 in eastern @entity48 and controls parts of the town center of @entity150 , the hometown of former @entity48 strongman @entity151			0
and it has built an increasingly significant presence in @entity154 itself , carrying out a gun attack on the @entity156 in january			0
a number of @entity2 are also believed to be training with @entity90 in a half dozen training camps the group operates in the @entity160 between @entity52 and @entity147 in eastern @entity48			2
in late 2012 @entity163 's @entity162 affiliate @entity161 set up a branch in @entity2 called the @entity165 , a 60 - strong @entity100 outfit composed of @entity2 , @entity167 , and some @entity48			2
the group is believed to include fighters driven out of @entity169 by @entity171 forces			0
the @entity165 has been responsible for a string of attacks on @entity2 security services in mountainous @entity176 region along the @entity167 border			1
" they have been the most active terrorist organization in @entity2 to date , " @entity54 told @entity0			2
" it is rumored , but not confirmed , that they are getting additional personnel from @entity167 because members of @entity161 in @entity167 have been fleeing intensified @entity167 military operations			0
" @entity183 , a @entity162 security analyst based in @entity184 told @entity0 that the @entity165 issued a statement late last year threatening to attack @entity98			0
" most of their attacks have been in the @entity176 region but it 's possible they have extended their operations closer to the capital , " he said			2
the museum attack is the biggest crisis faced by @entity2 since the revolution			2
it is likely to significantly impact @entity2 's tourism industry , worsening the economic outlook and increasing the sense of frustration on which extremists thrive			1
there is also concern @entity2 security forces , traumatized by the attack on the capital , could once again embrace repression in their struggle to contain the @entity100 threat			2
" the @entity210 was debating tougher anti-terrorism laws when the museum attack took place			0
the worry now is that @entity2 's security services will crack down hard on @entity23 increasing tensions and making the problem far worse , " @entity183 told @entity0 .			2

@entity2 was widely seen as only success story of @entity11
economic progress has lagged behind democratic principles
@entity224 has been *percolating* in the region for a while , stoked by regional *unrest*
