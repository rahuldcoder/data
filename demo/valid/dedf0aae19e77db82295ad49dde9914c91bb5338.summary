a year later , it still sounds impossible : a sophisticated $ 270 million airliner carrying 239 people disappears , leaving very few clues about where it went			1
but did the tragedy of @entity8 really have to be such a mystery ? maybe not			1
lingering questions -- and the trauma experienced by friends and family of passengers and crew of the @entity16 -- all might have been avoided if already proven technology had been put into place			1
believe it or not , in our modern world , airplane tracking technology has yet to enter the 21st century			1
why are n't air traffic controllers using it to constantly track all commercial airliners ? how about communicating with satellites ? why do n't all airliners stream their so - called black box data to satellites in real time ? the technology is available			1
yes , it 's expensive , but so is searching hundreds of thousands of square miles of vast ocean			2
let 's break it down			2
flight 370 had eight ways to communicate with the ground while in flight : five very high frequency and high frequency radios that could transmit and receive voice and data transmissions			1
two transponders that could send identification and altitude data to air traffic control radar screens			1
one satellite transceiver that could transmit and receive text messages and phone calls			0
despite this technology , the world lost track of the flight with the airline industry codename @entity8			1
to understand why , you first have to know a little about the technology and the gaps in the system			1
throughout most of the world , air traffic controllers still track airplanes with radar -- which uses technology dating back to the 1940s			1
radar is reliable , but it is limited			1
it comes with large gaps in coverage areas			0
aircraft flying more than about 200 miles from land over oceans are not tracked by air traffic control radar screens			1
radar covers only about 2 % or 3 % of the planet 's surface , experts say			1
the rest is a virtual aviation @entity82			0
if an aircraft 's transponders are turned off , an aircraft can be seen only through so - called primary radar			1
in these cases , air traffic controllers see only a blip on radar screens			2
the blip is n't identified and the plane 's altitude is unknown			0
in a nutshell , here 's the electronic communication from flight 370 after it left @entity97 on march 8 , 2014 : nearly 30 minutes after takeoff , the plane sends a text via satellite that confirms it 's headed to @entity102 , as expected			0
later , the plane sends a final radio call as it transitions between @entity106 air traffic controllers to controllers in @entity108			0
but air traffic controllers in @entity110 never heard from the crew			0
three minutes after the radio call , the plane 's two transponders mysteriously cease transmitting			0
but primary radar operated by the military in @entity106 and @entity116 is able to track the 777 for limited periods without its transponder being on			2
later , an orbiting satellite checks in with the plane 's satellite transceiver , kind of like a cell tower pinging a mobile phone			0
the aircraft responds electronically -- " shaking hands " with the satellite			0
this provides evidence that @entity8 ended somewhere in the southern @entity130			1
all of these clues offer us only a few scraps of information that leave investigators with very little to go on			0
it leads them to an almost inescapable conclusion : whatever happened on @entity8 was likely deliberate , experts say			1
we might know more if the plane 's transponders had remained active			0
in the wake of the tragedy , some called for airlines to modify their transponders to prevent anyone from being able to shut them off in flight			0
but many pilots oppose that idea as a safety issue			0
they want to be able to turn off any electrical system on board in case of a fire or other in - flight emergency			0
we might know more about what happened to @entity8 if air traffic controllers used orbiting satellites to track airliners , instead of radar			1
in the @entity164 it 's called the @entity165 , or @entity165			0
an aircraft outfitted with this system determines its location using gps and transmits that data back to controllers by radio -- which has a greater range than radar			2
the technology is called @entity176 , or @entity176 it is the keystone component of @entity165			2
but still , when an aircraft flies over the ocean , it will be out of range			0
so the industry is testing a space - based system -- where planes would determine their position via gps satellites and report those coordinates via communication satellite network wherever they are in the world			2
there are numerous technical details that need to be worked out , but moving from spinning radar domes to orbiting satellites could eventually make blind spots in airliner tracking a thing of the past			1
another emerging technology that might have helped us know more about what happened is called @entity201 , the @entity202 , developed by a @entity204 company called @entity205			1
@entity201 monitors what the flight data recorder , one of the so - called " black boxes , " is seeing			0
it starts transmitting key information automatically when it senses trouble or at the command of the flight crew or dispatchers on the ground			2
@entity204 's @entity216 is among the first airlines to equip its fleet with @entity201 , which costs $ 100,000 per plane			0
if all airliners were equipped this way , we could know a flight was in trouble even if the crew could not communicate by other means			2
it could make searching for the black boxes a thing of the past			0
in the months since @entity8 was lost , international aviation authorities have moved toward tracking airliners more closely			1
the @entity233 has announced new tracking mandates for member airlines , but there are no plans to require streaming data			2
and this week , @entity240 's air traffic control manager , @entity241 , announced a test partnership with @entity106 and @entity243 to track long - haul flights over remote ocean routes			0
they 'll use satellite - based positioning technology to track flights at least every 15 minutes -- improving on the previous tracking rate of every 30 to 45 minutes , @entity241 said in a statement			1
" the system can be increased to real time monitoring should an abnormal situation arise			0
" would any of these improvements in airline communication technology have helped the world learn what happened to flight 370 ? possibly			1
unfortunately , we may never know for sure			0
although technology continues to shrink the planet in terms of communication , the tragedy offers a bitter reminder of how easy it still is to lose an entire airliner full of people .			2

modern tracking technology might have helped solve the mystery of @entity8
a year after @entity8 vanished , airline tracking is still largely the same
most airliners use ground radar instead of satellites ; tracking over oceans is spotty , at best
