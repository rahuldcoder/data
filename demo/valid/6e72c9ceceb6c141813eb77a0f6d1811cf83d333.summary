in fairy tales , it 's usually the princess that needs protecting			2
at @entity6 's headquarters in @entity7 , the princess is the one defending the castle			1
meet @entity9 , the 31 - year - old with perhaps the most enchanted job title in engineering -- " @entity12			1
" her job is to hack into the most popular web browser on the planet , trying to find flaws in the system before the " black hats " do			2
indeed , much like the good and bad witches of the @entity21 , hackers are described as having " white " or " black " hats			0
to defeat @entity6 's attackers , @entity9 must firstly think like them			1
in this cyberspace battle , the data of around a billion @entity26 users hangs in the balance -- and @entity9 was n't going to settle for any old moniker			1
" when i started , my official job title was ' information security engineer , ' which i thought was a bit boring and not really meaningful , " said the @entity31 - @entity30 , speaking a million miles an hour over the phone from @entity33			1
" so i changed it to ' security princess ' as more of a tongue - in - cheek thing			1
i 've never been exceptionally girly or fit the stereotype of a princess , so it was a bit ironic for me to go by that name -- and then it stuck ! " @entity9 's role has evolved dramatically in the eight years since she first started working at @entity6			1
back then , the young graduate from @entity47 was one of 50 security engineers -- today there are over 500			2
" our users include presidents of foreign countries -- i hope @entity54 uses @entity26 too			0
it includes really highly - targeted individuals , political dissidents , journalists , and people who just want to casually use the internet , " she said			2
" @entity6 depends on those users trusting us with their data			2
so if we ca n't protect it , we have no business			0
" cybercrime has come a long way in the past decade -- from the cliched @entity68 prince scam to credit card theft , and suspected government surveillance over emails			0
@entity9 's biggest concern now is the people who find bugs in @entity6 's software , and sell the information to governments or criminals			1
to combat this , the company has set up a @entity81 , paying anywhere from $ 100 to $ 20,000 for reported glitches			0
" what we 've seen in the last couple of years is what we suspect to be governments trying to intercept communications , " said @entity9			2
" in one case , there were @entity31 - region @entity91 users whose connection was being intercepted			0
" " these incidents are especially scary since they seem to be carried out by large , well - funded organizations or governments , " she added			0
it 's a world away from @entity9 's computer - free childhhod home in @entity99			1
the daughter of an @entity31 - @entity102 doctor father , and @entity104 - @entity102 nurse mother , @entity9 had little contact with computers until she started studying engineering at college			1
@entity109 across a line - up of @entity6 security staff today and you 'll find women like @entity9 are few and far between -- though in the last few years she has hired more female tech whizzes			1
she admits there 's an obvious gender imbalance in @entity7 , but for once is stumped on the fault			0
" clearly the numbers make you think ' what is the problem that there are n't more women working in security , that there are n't more women working in technology ? " she said			0
" and it does make me think what is the problem here ? is it the culture or the atmosphere ? " funnily enough , during training sessions @entity9 first asks new recruits to hack not a computer , but a vending machine			1
" there 's this idea that you need to be a super genius computer geek to be a hacker			0
but in reality , i think anybody can be a hacker in the real world -- just think of all the non-software examples , " said @entity9			2
" a lot of people ask me what 's the best answer i 've been given to the vending machine problem , and the real answer is there is none			0
some people think about how they 'd steal their favorite snack ; some people figure out how to steal the entire machine of snacks ; and some people figure out how they could add some sort of functionality to the machine that was n't there before " @entity9 's job is as much about technological know - how , as understanding the psychology of attackers			1
" anybody who 's working in defense -- police officers , security , or law enforcement -- has to stop and think ' what is the enemy or the attacker going to do ? ' " she said			0
" because you always want to stay one step ahead of them			0
" read more from @entity180 , @entity181 : the world 's largest machine gets ready to restart you will you soon be able to ' swallow the doctor ' the end of electronics as we know it ?			0
