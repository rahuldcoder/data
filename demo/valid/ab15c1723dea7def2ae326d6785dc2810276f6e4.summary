i 'm @entity2 , and i am professor of @entity3 and early @entity4 at the @entity5			1
i was an adviser on the " @entity7 " episode and served as one of the many on - camera experts in @entity1 's " @entity12 " series , which airs on sundays			1
viewers were invited during the show to tweet and post their questions on the " finding @entity12 " @entity17 page			1
below are some of the more interesting questions and my answers to them			1
they have been edited for style and clarity for this article			1
what 's " true " about the cross that killed @entity12 ? @entity26 : where might there be other pieces of the " true cross " ? is anyone attempting to carbon date these relics ? @entity2 : there are churches all over the world that claim to have fragments or splinters of the true cross			1
these are n't being carbon dated and there are a few reasons why			1
first , carbon dating is expensive , and your average church does n't have the funds for this kind of endeavor			1
second , carbon dating is seen as intrusive and a little destructive			1
even if only about 10 milligrams of wood are needed , you 're still chipping away at a holy object			1
this is n't something that churches like to do , especially as -- and this leads me to my third point -- almost all carbon dating tests end up discrediting the relics that are being tested			1
so , it 's not in the best interest of the @entity64 and @entity63 that claim to possess relics to have them tested			2
@entity66 : are you able to tell what type of wood the cross was built from ? @entity2 : unless we know with complete certainty that we have a fragment of the true cross , then we wo n't be able to assert what kind of wood was used			1
nonetheless , we can make some best guesses			2
a number of scholars have thought that the cross was made of cedar because cedar is a sturdy wood found in the region			2
there is also evidence from the crucifixion of other criminals			2
in 1968 , the remains of a crucified man named @entity90 were found during excavations in northern @entity92			2
we know he was crucified because there was a spike embedded in his ankle bone			2
the @entity98 at the @entity99 in @entity92 concluded that the wood underneath the nail was olive wood			2
so perhaps that 's a possibility			0
@entity104 : how can we be certain the @entity105 did n't reuse @entity12 ' cross ? @entity2 : this is a great question			1
hewn wood and nails were more valuable in the ancient world than they are today			0
there are examples of the @entity105 discarding tools and other implements ( for instance after the battle of @entity119 , when they left behind pottery vessels rather than haul them away ) , but this usually took place in situations where carrying these tools was more effort than it was worth			0
the @entity105 were efficient and would likely have reused the instruments of torture if they could			0
the @entity130 historian @entity129 tells us that wood was scarce around @entity92 in the first century @entity133 and that the @entity105 had to travel 10 miles to secure timber for the siege of @entity92 ( @entity136 5.522 - 23 )			0
@entity129 was writing about a period of war some 40 years later but , all the same , we can imagine that the @entity105 wanted to conserve the wood that they had			0
in other words , you 're absolutely right : we ca n't be sure the cross upon which @entity12 was crucified was n't reused in the execution of other criminals or in some other kind of construction			0
how well do you know the life of @entity12 ? take the quiz			0
@entity149 : if the crucifixion of @entity151 was so important to @entity152 , why are there no images of @entity151 on the cross in @entity4 art until about the seventh century @entity133 ? prior to that time , the depictions are usually of a lamb on the cross			0
@entity2 : it is certainly true that early on ( first - third century ) @entity152 did not use the image of the cross in their art. this in part seems to have been because crucifixion was so shameful and humiliating			1
depicting a cross would be akin to using an image of an electric chair or a hangman 's noose			0
so , early on , @entity152 used images of @entity104 in the lion 's den , @entity173 and the whale and the three young men in the fiery furnace in the funeral art as symbols of resurrection and conquest of death			0
beginning in the fourth century , things began to change			0
@entity184 's vision was really instrumental in this process			0
the cross began to be retrieved as a symbol of power , so that instead of being a symbol of shameful death it became an emblem of victory over death			0
there are a lot of really interesting studies of the emergence of the cross in early @entity4 art ; i 'd recommend @entity203 's " @entity202 " as a great place to start .			0
