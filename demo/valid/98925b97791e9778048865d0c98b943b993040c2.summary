i was in @entity2 last year when i got a call asking me to pose for a calendar			1
what ? a calendar ? as in @entity8 swimsuit ? @entity11 's @entity10 angels ? cover girls			1
i agreed , and now i am ms. december			1
but it is n't quite what you think			1
the caller on the other end that day was @entity23			2
she was an anchor at @entity24 at a time when there were few @entity29 - @entity28 women in high - profile media jobs			1
@entity23 has her own media company now , but more recently she launched a nonprofit called @entity33 to suits			2
she was asking me to help			2
she began by telling me her story			1
she was 12 when her family immigrated to the @entity28			2
@entity29 parents often have to save a lot of money to ensure a good marriage for their daughter			2
@entity23 said that was a big reason why her family left			2
we spoke about similar experiences as @entity29 teenagers in @entity28			2
she was not allowed to go to the prom or wear shorts , except to play tennis			2
she had an 8 p.m. curfew and her father expected she would be married soon after college			2
@entity23 felt like a burden			2
she did everything she could to stand on her own			2
my father was not as stern but he had a hard time watching his little girl become " americanized			2
" i , too , longed to be independent , far more so than was expected of a @entity61 girl in the 1970s			2
at an all - girls convent school in @entity63 , i used to climb up three flights of stairs to reach my classroom			2
on every landing were oversized portraits of national leaders , most of them @entity29			2
hundreds of girls in white uniforms made the stampede - like dash up the stairwell			0
it was impossible to stop but i always looked up when i arrived at @entity78			0
there she was , in her trademark white sari and what i thought was a @entity84 slice in her hair			0
in a nation that valued boys more than girls , i was in awe that we had a female prime minister			0
@entity93 's political career turned out to be less than stellar , but it was 1971 and i was not yet 9 years old			1
i wanted to grow up to be just like her			0
and most of all , in control of my destiny			0
i know so many other @entity29 girls felt the same			0
we wanted to be someone , do something rewarding with our lives			0
yet for so many girls in @entity29 , dreams are vanquished by nightmare life scenarios			0
they are denied education and married off within months of their first period			0
i have met women who were abducted and forced into prostitution or lived with physically and mentally abusive men			1
those problems are not limited to @entity29 or the rest of @entity117			1
they exist in the immigrant communities in the @entity28 , in which abuse and crimes are underreported because of the stigma that still exists			1
women are often ashamed to talk about these things			1
as an @entity29 - @entity28 journalist , i have told stories with hopes of casting light on the world inhabited by many @entity117 women			1
i have mentored girls in my hometown of @entity63			0
and always wondered : what else can i do ? some of that desire stems from my own circumstances in life			0
as a newborn , i was left on the steps of an orphanage in north @entity63			0
it happened to be run by an @entity28 missionary , @entity142 , who happened to meet my adoptive mother at the @entity144			0
my mother was honing her @entity147 speaking skills there			0
that was in 1962 and my parents were childless after 10 years of marriage			0
it 's not hard to guess the rest of the story			1
instead of growing up in harsh surroundings , i was raised in a professor 's house			1
and , instead of a future that might have been filled with darkness , i faced one that was bright			0
i had loving parents , attended good schools and traveled around the world			0
there is not a day that goes by when i do n't think about the life i might have led had it not been for that fateful meeting between an @entity28 missionary and a @entity61 woman pining to become a mother			1
i shared my story with @entity23 and told her i would help			1
@entity23 put together @entity33 to suits as an empowerment tool			1
she wanted to raise money to help @entity117 women			1
she also wanted to inspire them , she said			0
they needed strong role models			0
they needed to know that they could break out of the molds that were cast for them			0
she was putting together the @entity183 to suits calendar and wanted to feature @entity117 women who had found success in @entity28			1
they were doctors , lawyers , corporate leaders			0
one was a weightlifter from @entity190 who struggled with balancing her sport and her @entity194 attire			0
i felt honored to be in such fine company			0
i would be the only journalist in the calendar			1
it would most certainly be my only chance in life to pretend i was a glamour girl			0
some of the women opted to wear saris , the traditional dress of @entity29			1
some wore salwar kameez , a long tunic and pants			0
and some of us were in suits or our work attire			0
the 2014 calendar , the first one @entity23 published , raised money for various organizations that help @entity117 women			1
one of them was @entity216 ( which means protection )			0
based in @entity219 , @entity216 provides support for the @entity117 community in a number of ways			1
most of its clients are women who are dealing with abusive marriages , divorce and issues with their children			1
@entity216 's executive director , @entity231 , told me why the calendar was important			1
" i think it is a reminder that there are women overcoming obstacles and that they have the potential to achieve their own goals for themselves , " she said			1
" i think it is powerful for young @entity117 women to see role models that look like themselves -- role models who are making change and following their dreams			1
" her words took me back to my school in @entity63 where i gazed upward at @entity78 's face			1
in it , i found strength			0
i am of course , a far cry from the likes of @entity93 , but perhaps i can inspire a teenager out there to be the architect of her future			0
maybe a young woman in a sari will be able to put on a suit for the first time in her life			1
besides , it 's kind of cool to be in a calendar .			1

@entity1 's @entity266 shares her story of struggle and success as a @entity117 woman
@entity272 was featured as part of the @entity275 calendar , a tool **create*d* to empower women
