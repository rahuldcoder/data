@entity0 within the @entity3 rainforest of @entity4 live the @entity5			1
photographer @entity6 traveled about 30 hours by air , water and land to reach this native community and take their portraits			1
the @entity5 , which means " the people " or " human beings , " are believed to have inhabited the rainforest for thousands of years			1
until about the 1960s , they never had any contact with the outside world			0
@entity6 said there is a contrast between the modernization of the younger generation , who travel to areas outside of their community , and the older generation , who make efforts to maintain their traditional ways of living			1
diverse changes have taken place within the community : the introduction of radios within many @entity5 homes , the consumption of food from cities and the adoption of westernized clothing			1
for @entity6 , these changes were a significant factor in his decision to photograph the @entity5			1
" the biggest ( reason ) was to just go out there and photograph the change before everything changes , " @entity6 said			2
" i think if i would have ( photographed the @entity5 ) 10 years back down the line or a little later than that , i do n't think i would have got what i just got			2
" another aspect of modernization has to do with language			0
many @entity5 , who for years have only communicated using a regional dialect , now speak the @entity4 native language of @entity58			1
@entity6 speaks @entity59 , so he needed translators to interact effectively			2
but it is apparent from his experiences with the @entity5 that actions can certainly not only speak louder than words , but be more effectual than words when attempting to convey one 's intentions			2
" i never started photographing when i ( first ) saw ( the @entity5 ) , " he said			2
" i did n't even have my camera			0
i waited to let them get used to me around them			0
i gave myself time to get a little easier around them			0
even if you can not talk in the same language , i feel that you definitely connect to them as a human being			0
" social media follow @ @entity78 on @entity79 to join the conversation about photography			0
prior to creating formal portraits using his professional camera equipment and lighting , @entity6 took @entity86 photos of the @entity5 that they were then able to keep			1
" i think some of them saw the @entity86 for the first time , so they were really happy to see themselves like that , " @entity6 said			0
for his formal portraits , @entity6 placed his subjects in front of a solid white background in order to portray the @entity5 in a very direct and concise manner , eliminating the presence of any distractions			1
" the main reason was to have the focus only on the people and their clothes and nothing else but them as an individual , them as a human being , " he said			0
@entity6 's decision to use a white background also proved effective in highlighting the coexistence between the @entity5 and the different kinds of animals they encounter daily in their natural environment			1
creating portraits of the @entity5 has been a " fascinating , challenging " experience for @entity6 , who is studying photography in @entity116 at the @entity117			1
after witnessing firsthand the simplicity in which the @entity5 live in harmony with their environment , @entity6 said he finds himself thinking about and reflecting upon what it truly means to be satisfied and content with life			1
" i think the question i ask myself is : ' who 's richer ? ' " he said			0
" ( this has been ) a really big learning curve of how to just live a very beautiful , normal life			0
" @entity6 is an @entity129 photographer studying at the @entity117 in @entity116			2
you can follow him on @entity131 , @entity79 and @entity132 .			0
