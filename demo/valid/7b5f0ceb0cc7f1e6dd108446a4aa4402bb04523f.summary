the odds seemed almost impossibly stacked against @entity2 , but she survived			1
rescuers found the toddler saturday , hanging upside down in her mother 's car , which had flipped into a frigid @entity8 river a day before			1
if the wreck occurred when police believe it did , she may have been there for as many as 14 hours			0
@entity2 's mother , @entity12 , died in the crash			1
she was 25 years old			1
how did her 18 - month - old survive ? one of the biggest factors was the car seat			1
@entity2 was in the proper car seat for her age and the seat appears to have been properly attached			1

" a variety of other factors were also likely at play			0
" we do n't know what time the child was last fed , when she drank			0
given that it 's wintertime and she was in her car seat , she was probably wearing mittens , a hat			0
we tend to over bundle our children , so the fact that she was dry , she probably had on multiple layers because it 's winter , and there 's always a chance that she had just been sort of fed right before this happened probably all played a role , " @entity29 said			1
a final factor may have been that the girl , as a toddler , has baby fat -- a little extra insulation			0
if she had been an infant , it might have been a different story			0
children are very resilient , and i think sometimes we do n't realize how much they actually can withstand , " said @entity29			1
