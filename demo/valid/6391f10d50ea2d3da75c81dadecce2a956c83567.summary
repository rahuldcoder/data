@entity0 are scheduled to head to the polls this saturday in what will be the most closely watched elections in @entity5 this year			2
the poll will test the strength of an electoral process that has been marred by violence and flawed results throughout the country 's short democratic history			1
the stakes are high , and there is a very real danger of prolonged violence across the country if the electorate questions the legitimacy of the outcome			0
the conduct of the elections will have long lasting repercussions on both @entity0 and the @entity25 - @entity0 relationship			1
against the backdrop of these elections is the ongoing threat and destabilization caused by @entity29 , a group that has killed more than 10,000 people in northeastern @entity0 during its five - year campaign of terror , and kidnapped hundreds more , including young girls			0
these actions have shocked and horrified @entity25			0
what many @entity25 may not recognize is how important the relationship with @entity0 is for the @entity25			1
we have economic and security interests that are at stake in this election , especially as @entity0 has been one of our strongest allies in the region since military rule there ended			1
in the last decade , the @entity25 has trained and equipped thousands of @entity0 soldiers who have participated in peacekeeping missions in @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 , helping bring a measure of peace and stability to nations in the @entity5 region			1
but now we need @entity0 to be a front - line ally against terrorism , particularly as @entity29 pledges fidelity to the @entity60			2
meanwhile , @entity0 also has the largest economy in @entity5 and has the continent 's largest population			2
indeed , it has been identified as one in the next set of prominent emerging economies , making it a tantalizing target for @entity25 private investment			0
it is also @entity5 's no. 1 oil producer , although an increasingly diversified economy -- for example in the agriculture sector -- provides a myriad of opportunities for more robust trade with the @entity25			2
ultimately , a stable @entity0 will mean real economic opportunities for @entity25 -- a win - win proposition			1
yet despite this potential , the uncertain electoral environment and other serious challenges stand in the way of a deeper bond			0
the reality is that endemic corruption remains an obstacle to more cooperation , especially when you consider the @entity0 military 's poor performance fighting @entity29 , despite security spending reportedly being around $ 6 billion last year -- clearly , much of the money meant for the military is not being spent on salaries , equipment or materiel			1
similarly , weak governance remains an impediment to @entity0 's progress and enhanced ties with the @entity25			1
nearly 70 % of those in areas in the north live in absolute poverty , according to recent data , as compared to about 50 % in southern areas of the country			0
such failure on the part of the government to address poverty and inequality facilitates @entity29 's recruitment effort and foments internal instability			0
the @entity0 people clearly believe that these issues must be addressed			0
according to an @entity119 survey released in january , 74 % of @entity0 citizens said that their country is going " in the wrong direction			0
" half of @entity0 surveyed expressed significant concern about political intimidation or violence in the current election environment			0
if the @entity0 leadership rises to the challenge of tackling these difficult issues , there is nothing standing in the way of even closer ties between our two countries			0
but it is not just about the leadership -- this election offers the chance for all @entity0 to choose their future , and decide which policies will shape the next four years			1
their example , for better or worse , will be watched -- and perhaps even replicated by other @entity143 states			0
the decisions made in the coming days and weeks will shape @entity25 - @entity0 relations for years to come			2
but more importantly , they will determine the future for @entity0 's people			1
the world is watching @entity0 's historic choice with great expectation and even greater hope .			1

@entity154 : @entity0 vote will test the democracy 's electoral process , marred by violence and flawed results in past
@entity25 ties to this regional ally are crucial ; @entity25 economic and security interests at stake as @entity0 's voters choose their future
