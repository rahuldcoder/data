this has to be one of the least convincing scandals			0
during the four years that @entity5 was secretary of state she used ( brace yourselves ) a personal email account ! perhaps she thought this was a way of ensuring that @entity10 did n't read her emails			1
either way , @entity13 attempts to turn this into @entity5 's @entity16 fall short of the mark			1
on a scale of one to @entity20 , i 'd give this three			0
it is true that by using a commercial account , @entity22 opened herself up to being hacked			0
it is also true that the rules of the @entity27 stipulate that personal emails should only be used in " emergency situations " -- and as a historian i recognize the need for transparency and for keeping a record of everything written and sent for the appreciation of future generations			2
and we 'll recall , by the way , that officials in @entity41 's administration did something like this -- using nonofficial email accounts for official business -- and were hounded by the @entity46 for it			1
but whenever @entity22 pinged an email to an official government account , then the conversation would still have been archived , and her office insists that emails from her personal account were handed over anyway			1
the suggestion that she thought she might have " something to hide " would only make sense if she had used her personal account on some occasions but not others			2
she would have to have been blessed with the gift of clairvoyance to know back in 2009 that there would some day be controversy surrounding her handling of a siege of a @entity66 diplomatic compound in @entity67 -- and that it might be best to use personal email so as to cover her tracks in the future			1
@entity22 may be many things , but the @entity13 have yet to throw the witchcraft charge			0
@entity74 is angry about @entity22 's email farrago and has tweeted that transparency matters			1
he is keen that we should know that he has a website that documents all the email exchanges that he had as governor of @entity81			2
why on @entity84 's @entity83 he 's chosen to construct this archive , i ca n't imagine			2
it 's the kind of grand gesture that politicians imagine the voters will be swayed by but actually leaves us thinking , " do n't you have better things to do than this ? " or else wondering if there 's been some careful selecting of the emails to put the former governor in a good light			2
oh , there are some critical communications in the @entity74 archives			1
but i 'm suspicious that he appears never once to have been contacted by a @entity103 prince to say that he has $ 12 million that he 's trying to transfer out of the country or by a @entity106 lady looking for a husband			0
perhaps such conversations took place through @entity41 's personal account -- in which case , we need to know what he said in reply			1
of course there is a serious context to all of this : the @entity119 hearings			1
there is still much that the public has yet to be told , and @entity22 's emails may well be critical to discerning the truth			0
but there is a far less serious context to " email-gate , " too : the presidential election			0
literally every small slip that @entity22 has ever made is obviously going to be turned into a huge thing -- including such breaches of office etiquette as using the wrong email account			0
sources also told me that she sometimes puts her feet up on the desk and may have used the office phone for personal calls			0
wicked , wicked woman .			0

@entity141 : @entity5 's use of personal email is a *nonscandal*
he says a serious context is murky issue of @entity119 ; less serious is political context
