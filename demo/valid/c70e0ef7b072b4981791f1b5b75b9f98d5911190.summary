at first glance @entity0 seems like a normal 10 - year - old			1
she loves dressing up as @entity4 from " @entity5 , " playing with @entity7 dolls and going to the park or shopping			2
but what makes the @entity13 - @entity12 youngster stand out is the fact that she 's also a university undergraduate			1
@entity0 , from @entity15 , an industrial town in the @entity13 's @entity17 , is one of the country 's youngest college freshmen			1
the talented 10 - year - old enrolled at the @entity20 , a @entity13 - based distance learning college , in january and is already top of the class , having recently scored 100 % in a recent exam			1
" it 's so interesting			2
it has the type of maths i love			2
it 's real maths -- theories , complex numbers , all that type of stuff , " she giggles			2
" it was super easy			2
my mum taught me in a nice way			2
" she adds : " i want to ( finish the course ) in two years			2
then i 'm going to do my phd in financial maths when i 'm 13			0
i want to have my own bank by the time i 'm 15 because i like numbers and i like people and banking is a great way to help people			0
" and in case people think her parents have pushed her into starting university early , @entity0 emphatically disagrees			1
" i actually wanted to start when i was seven			0
but my mum was like , " you 're too young , calm down			0
" after three years of begging , mother @entity53 finally agreed to explore the idea			0
a marvelous mathematical mind @entity0 has always jumped ahead of her peers			1
she sat her first math gsce exam , a @entity13 high school qualification , at @entity61 in @entity62 at just six , where she received a c - grade			1
a year later , she outdid herself and got the a-grade she wanted			1
then last year she scored a b - grade when she sat the @entity68 exam			1
@entity0 's mother noticed her daughter 's flair for figures shortly after she began homeschooling her at the age of three			1
initially , @entity0 's parents had enrolled her in a private school but after a few short weeks , the pair began noticing changes in the usually - vibrant youngster			1
@entity53 says : " one day we were coming back home and she burst out in tears and she said ' i do n't ever want to go back to that school -- they do n't even let me talk ! ' " in the @entity13 , you do n't have to start school until you are five			1
education is not compulsory until that age so i thought ok , we 'll be doing little things at home until then			0
maybe by the time she 's five she will change her mind			0
" @entity53 started by teaching basic number skills but @entity0 was miles ahead			1
by four , her natural aptitude for maths had seen the eager student move on to algebra and quadratic equations			1
and @entity0 is n't the only maths prodigy in the family			1
her younger brother @entity101 , 6 , will soon be sitting his first @entity68 exam in june			1
a philanthropic family not content with breaking barriers to attend college at just 10 years old , @entity0 is also writing a series of math workbooks for children called " @entity109			1
" " it starts at a beginner level -- that 's volume one			0
but then there will be volume two , and volume three , and then volume four			0
but i 've only written the first one			0
" as long as you can add or subtract , you 'll be able to do it			0
i want to show other children they are special , " she says			0
meanwhile , @entity0 's parents are also trying to trail blaze their own educational journey back in @entity12			1
the couple have set up a foundation and are in the process of building a nursery and primary school in @entity12 's @entity131 ( where the family are from )			1
named " @entity136 , " they hope to open the school 's doors in september			2
the proposed curriculum will have all the usual subjects such as @entity139 , languages , math and science , as well as more unconventional additions including morality and ethics , public speaking , entrepreneurship and etiquette			0
the couple say they want to emulate the teaching methods that worked for their children rather than focus on one way of learning			0
" some children learn very well with kinesthetics where they learn with their hands -- when they draw they remember things			0
some children have extremely creative imaginations			0
instead of trying to make children learn one way , you teach them based on their learning style , " explains @entity53			0
the educational facility will have a capacity of 2,000 to 2,500 students with up to 30 % of students being local children offered scholarships to attend			2
@entity53 says : " on one hand , billions of dollars worth of crude oil is pumped out from that region on a monthly basis and yet the poverty rate of the indigenous community is astronomical			0
" while @entity179 adds : " ( the region has ) poor quality of nursery and primary education			0
so by the time the children get secondary education they have n't got a clue			2
they have n't developed their core skills			0
" the school is designed to give children an aim so they can study for something , not just for the sake of acquiring certifications			2
there is an end goal			0
