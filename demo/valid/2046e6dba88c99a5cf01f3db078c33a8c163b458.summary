@entity1 @entity0 appears poised to keep his job as @entity5 's prime minister , declaring victory wednesday following a bitter campaign punctuated by his last - minute appeals to right - wing voters			1
for weeks , @entity0 's @entity11 party trailed in opinion polls to the @entity14 alliance that characterized him as a divisive leader not up to the task of making the lives of ordinary @entity5 better			1
those polls turned out to be wrong			0
instead , the @entity11 party grabbed at least 29 of the 120 seats in the @entity21 , @entity5 's parliament , according to unofficial numbers from the @entity5 election committee , based on 99 % of the vote			1
its leaders will have the first chance at forming a coalition government			1
the @entity14 came in second , with at least 24 seats			0
" @entity33 , against all odds , we achieved this huge victory for @entity11 , " @entity0 told jubilant supporters not long after the polls closed tuesday			1
" we achieved the huge victory for our people			0
and i am proud , i am proud for the people of @entity5 that in the moment of truth , knew to make the right decision and to choose the real material things over immaterial things			2
" rather than courting voters in the middle , @entity0 pivoted more to the right with appeals concerning @entity5 's security			1
two weeks ago , he made a controversial speech to the @entity50 warning of any deal with @entity52 on its nuclear program			0
then , a few days ago , he declared there would be no @entity56 state so long as he 's prime minister -- reversing an earlier position and putting him at odds again with the @entity61 administration 's support for a two - state solution			2
on tuesday , he released a video on @entity64 claiming leftists were bringing " huge amounts " of @entity68 by bus to vote against @entity11			2
@entity68 make up about 20 % of @entity5 's population			1
" the right regime is in danger , " @entity0 said			2
" we have an urgent wake - up call			0
bring your friends , bring your family , vote for @entity11			2
" those appeals appear " to have energized that right - wing base , " according to @entity2 's @entity78			0
@entity0 still has to form a new government , a process that president @entity81 said he hopes will start sunday			2
if the @entity11 leader does so -- as expected -- it will leave @entity5 not much different than it was before the election , with a conservative @entity0 still the dominant force facing a dug - in opposition			1
5 questions about @entity0 's apparent victory @entity90 , who led the @entity14 , called @entity0 to concede defeat			1
but he and fellow opposition leader @entity92 wo n't go away , with @entity90 insisting that " nothing has changed			0
" " this is not the time for coalitions and governments , " @entity90 said , apparently ruling out joining forces with @entity0 as the @entity95 has done before			2
" i think what @entity5 is most in need of is an alternative voice that continues to say the truth			0
" and i 'm telling everyone , ' believe , a change will come			0
' " official results will not be released until next week , with the process of building coalitions expected to take much longer			1
no party has ever won a majority of seats in the @entity21 , meaning coalition governments are as old as the modern state of @entity5			1
the victory goes to the party leader most suited to put together a 61 - seat majority			0
@entity117 , an ex-adviser to the @entity119 government on @entity68 - @entity5 negotiations now with the @entity121 , predicts former @entity5 communications minister @entity122 will be the " kingmaker " in any coalition government deal based on the support his @entity127 party got tuesday			1
how does @entity5 's parliament work ? there 's no guarantee @entity0 will form such a coalition and stay as prime minister			1
but he 's got a better chance than anyone , and overnight he vowed to work " quickly and responsibly to form a new government			0
" " our country 's everyday reality does n't give us the luxury for delay , " @entity0 said			2
if he does lead the next government , he will soon go down in history as the prime minister with the longest continuous tenure in @entity5 -- thanks to his back - to - back - to - back election wins			2
many woke up wednesday questioning all those polls suggesting that @entity0 's latest six - year term could be coming to an end			1
@entity5 media outlets released surveys suggesting that either the @entity155 would win the vote or , at least , finish in a dead heat with @entity11			1
exit polls from @entity5 's three major broadcasters showed the two parties neck and neck , not the apparent five - seat advantage that @entity11 appears to have secured			1
so what happened ? pollster @entity166 , who predicted a @entity11 win all along , said other pollsters relied too heavily on internet technology and should have done more surveying by phone			0
" the internet does not represent the state of @entity5 and the people of @entity5 , " @entity166 said , referring to modern statistical methods			0
" it represents panels , and the panels are biased strongly to the center			0
" as @entity0 's win reverberates , one question remains : did he gain extra seats because of an 11th - hour surge , or were the major polls skewed from the beginning ? why were the election polls so wrong ? @entity0 maintained hard - line positions on settlements and negotiations with @entity56 , but his opposition appeared more open to talks and more focused on economic , social and other issues within @entity5			1
@entity193 , the @entity56 chief negotiator with @entity5 , said , " the results of the @entity5 elections show the success of a campaign platform based on settlements , racism , apartheid and the denial of fundamental human rights of the @entity56 people			1
" such a result would not have been possible had the international community held @entity5 to account for its systematic violations of international law , " said @entity193 , who works under @entity205 president @entity204			0
opinion : will @entity0 win seal @entity52 deal ? the post-election view from @entity213 , the @entity215 political and militant movement that controls @entity216 and is considered a terrorist organization by the @entity119 and @entity218 , appeared more resigned			0
" @entity213 does n't see any difference between the @entity5 parties because they all share the denial of our people 's rights and keeps assaulting them ( people ) , " said @entity219 , a @entity213 spokesman , suggesting that it did n't matter much who prevailed tuesday			2
" we assure that the @entity56 resistance is strong and can impose the facts			0
" @entity117 , the @entity121 scholar , says he does n't think that @entity0 will necessarily hold his hard campaign line on the @entity56 forming their own state if and when he starts his next term			1
but that does n't mean an elusive peace deal is coming anytime soon			0
" i think the two - state solution , sadly , is in a @entity239 , sandwiched between a situation that 's too hard for it to be implemented and too important for all of the parties -- including the prime minister , despite what he said , " @entity117 said			0
opinion : the danger of @entity0 's win @entity2 's @entity248 reported from @entity1 , and @entity249 and @entity250 wrote and reported from @entity251			1
@entity2 's @entity252 , @entity253 and @entity254 contributed to this report .			0
