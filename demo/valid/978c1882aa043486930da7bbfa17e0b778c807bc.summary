they were not - so - affectionately dubbed the " bed - wetters " by then - @entity3 senior adviser @entity2			2
the definition : democrats who run to the hills every time there 's a bump in the road			2
the woe - is - us crowd			2
well , they 're at it again			2
not surprisingly , it 's because of the @entity20 email brouhaha , an unforced error that is now ricocheting around the political world			2
and the home team stands in place , just watching , somewhat stunned			2
but @entity6 do n't actually have the luxury of standing by and seeing how this all plays out			1
@entity20 is their candidate ; their putative nominee			2
" their only viable plan is to make her the best candidate possible , " says one senior @entity6 strategist			1
" and from time to time , this may require an intervention			0
" now might be a good time			0
but while the anxious democrats shake their heads about the state of affairs — and the lack of serious alternatives in the presidential lineup — they might do well to look at themselves			0
over the past six years , there 's been a sharp structural decline of elected @entity6 everywhere below the presidential level			1
sure , we all know about how the @entity45 regained control of the @entity47 in 2014 , but what about the fact that blue - state governors fell like tent poles ? or that @entity45 governors now outnumber the @entity6 by almost two - to - one , 31 to 18			1
or that @entity45 have complete control of nearly three times as many state legislatures as the @entity6 , 30 to 11			1
and down the ballot , democrats under @entity3 have lost more than 900 state legislative seats : the worst showing of any modern president			0
that 's eye - popping			0
so , the conventional judgment that the @entity65 behemoth is just too big — too well funded , too well supported , too historic — all helps account for the paucity of alternatives , to be sure			1
but there 's much , much more to it than the phenom of @entity73			0
it 's the phenom of @entity3 , too — and the very strong counterforces he 's generated around the country			0
the gains at the presidential level have not been cost - free : the country is polarized , the @entity6 are often on defense and they 're losing ground			1
one result : a thin presidential bench , which is painfully evident			1
@entity65 asks @entity83 to release emails : what you need to know and if you take a peek at those blue - state governors who might be president , consider this : at 76 , @entity91 , an able leader , is probably past his sell - by date for a presidential bid			1
@entity95 gov. @entity94 has made very few moves to raise his national profile			0
and @entity6 governors are very thin on the ground in the heartland			1
any time you have @entity45 winning the gubernatorial races in @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 , @entity6 should pay attention			1
as has been the case with other presidents , for @entity3 party - building has not been on top of the agenda			0
and so when @entity20 runs into some trouble , the @entity6 ought to worry			1
the @entity45 have a deep and varied field ; the @entity6 have one real horse in the race no matter how much she stumbles out of the gate			1
speaking of @entity20 , part of the problem right now is situational			0
those democrats who want to defend her say there 's a problem -- they 're not quite sure what they 're defending , because they 're not sure exactly what happened , or why			2
in other words , the wagons are circled , but the surrogates are left outside			0
next , while @entity65 may have considered the upside of waiting to announce her candidacy ( why not let the @entity45 battle it out ? no need to give the @entity45 early target practice ? ) , the downside is now obvious : how do you mount a defense with no real or organized apparatus to respond ? if you 're out there making personal appearances , it looks odd to ignore the elephant in the room			1
no matter how much you tweet about it			0
@entity65 's stumbles fuel @entity6 critics bottom line , there is no organized pushback and there is no @entity155 ( ok , @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 , we know who you are , and that you 're probably running , but still			1
) or at least no @entity161 the pre-presidential league on the @entity6 side is not exactly overflowing with big - time candidates			1
( unless you think vice president @entity165 is running or secretary of state @entity166 is running , which they likely are not			0
same for @entity104 sen. @entity169			0
) so " bed - wetters , " beware			0
the truth is simple : your job is to defend @entity20 , not to bury her			2
yes , it can be hard			0
but think about it this way : if you do n't , her problems become your own .			0

@entity181 : @entity6 has no real alternative for 2016 and its bench is painfully thin
she says it may not be fun , but @entity6 have no choice but to defend @entity65 on issues like the email question
