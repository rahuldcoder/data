my name is @entity3 , and i am a professor of @entity4 and @entity6 origins in the @entity7 at @entity8			1
i was series adviser and one of many on - camera experts on @entity0 's " @entity11 , " which premiered sunday evening			1
i also appear in each episode of the program			1
viewers were invited to tweet and post their questions to @entity16 during the show			1
below are some of the most interesting , and my answers to them			1
@entity20 : is there a better way to check the shroud than carbon dating ? i 've been told carbon dating is very inaccurate			1
@entity3 : actually , carbon dating is an excellent way to ascertain the date of an artifact			1
many are disappointed , not surprisingly , that the shroud dated to between ad 1260 and 1390			2
i recall my own disappointment ( but not surprise ) on hearing the results back in 1988			2
but the scientists doing the carbon dating were not amateurs , and the samples were tested in three separate labs			1
moreover , the carbon date cohered with other evidence that the shroud was a medieval forgery , like the fact that there is no evidence of its existence until the 14th century			1
@entity47 : so i know the carbon dating was off , but was n't it later shown that the piece of cloth used for the testing was a section that had been repaired after some fire damage or something ? which would explain why it dated different ? @entity3 : no , that 's not been established			1
those who defend the authenticity of the shroud often say the sample might have been taken from a part of the shroud that was repaired after it was damaged by fire in the 16th century			2
but this is special pleading			2
the scientists who took the sample knew what they were doing			2
professor @entity69 noted that the unusual weave on the sample matched the weave on the rest of the shroud perfectly			1
@entity75 : so were @entity11 ' wrists nailed or his hands ? all shows and movies have his hands nailed			2
@entity3 : one of the curiosities about the @entity81 is that the figure appears to be nailed through the wrists			1
this has long intrigued those who have studied crucifixion because there is some anatomical plausibility here -- nails through the wrists would support the body better than nails through the palms of the hands			2
it is just possible that the bones of the only crucified victim we have , @entity96 , show a nail mark above the wrist , but this is disputed			2
there are two further factors here			0
one is that victims of crucifixion may often have been tied instead of ( or as well as ) being nailed			0
also , some dispute whether the shroud figure is nailed through the wrists			0
( see @entity111 's graphic			0
) @entity112 : once again , @entity113 is totally ignored			0
they used the gospel that described @entity116 as having discovered the empty tomb			0
when other @entity118 describe @entity113 as the one that discovered it and then she called out to others			0
@entity3 : well , you will be pleased to hear that there is an entire episode devoted to @entity113 in this series , and her identity and role are fully explored , including her presence at the empty tomb			1
i think you 'll enjoy it			0
@entity131 : about the @ @entity0 program on @entity11			1
good stuff , but i am not sure about @entity11 crying out in pain			0
a psalm : the lamb is silent			0
@entity3 : i found @entity138 's portrayal of @entity11 ' death in the drama really compelling , and his cry is quite arresting			1
it 's true that @entity143 says " he was led like a lamb to the slaughter , and as a sheep before its shearers is silent , so he did not open his mouth			0
" many early @entity150 saw this as a prophecy of the way that @entity11 , their @entity154 , died			0
it is apparently fulfilled in @entity11 ' silence during his trial ( e.g. @entity159 19:9 - 10 ) , but in all four @entity118 , @entity11 is vocal on the cross , and in the end he cries out with a loud voice ( e.g. @entity3 15:34 and 37 ) , so the drama makes good sense there			1
thanks again for watching and for all your great questions , and apologies that we could not answer all of them			0
i was really thrilled to be involved , and i loved working with the production team behind " @entity11			0
" i think they have put together a superb series , which blends visually compelling drama and intelligent commentary from a wide range of experts			0
i look forward to hearing everyone 's reactions to the remaining five episodes !			0
