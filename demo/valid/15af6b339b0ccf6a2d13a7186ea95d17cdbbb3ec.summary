@entity0 spent much of his life preserving the memory of his cousin @entity4			1
his death monday brought back memories for me			0
we met three years ago in an @entity10 hotel conference room			0
he and his wife , @entity12 , were touring the @entity13 to promote a new book			0
i could tell instantly that he was related to @entity4			1
his face resembled hers so much that it felt almost as though i was meeting her in person			0
" @entity28 " had just been published , based on 14 boxes of letters , postcards , photos and documents that @entity12 accidentally discovered in the attic of their house in @entity27			0
@entity0 told me that it was n't just @entity4 who loved to write ; everyone in the family did			1
the 6,000 recovered documents told a story of a family torn apart by war and anti-semitism			0
that day in @entity10 , i listened to @entity0 tell me about loved ones he lost			1
he told me he was lucky that his family had remained in neutral @entity39 when @entity40 broke out			0
i thought back to our conversation thursday when i learned the news of @entity0 ' death			1
he died peacefully at his home in @entity27 , @entity39 , at 90 , said an announcement posted on the website of @entity4 , the foundation that @entity0 headed			1
like millions of people who read " @entity50 , " i was deeply influenced by her words and in awe of her family 's courage			0
@entity4 received her diary on her 13th birthday and wrote in it for the two years that her family hid from the @entity62 in the secret annex of an @entity65 apartment			1
i was only in seventh grade when my father bought me the book in 1975			1
after the family was discovered , they were sent to @entity71			0
later , @entity4 and her sister @entity72 were taken to @entity73 , where they both died in march 1945			1
her father , @entity75 , was the sole survivor of the family , one of only 7,000 people who made it out alive from @entity71			1
in the course of my two hours with @entity0 , i learned new things about the young , @entity82 girl whose journal is arguably the most famous in the world			1
she called him @entity85 , short for @entity86 , @entity0 ' formal name			1
in his youth , @entity0 was an actor and a skater with @entity90			1
he was her first cousin and 4 years older			0
" @entity85 , maybe we can skate as a pair together someday , " @entity4 wrote in january 1941 from @entity65			1
" but i know i 'll have to train very hard to be as good as you are			0
" in another letter , @entity4 outlined the steps to their skating routine and drew a picture of the blue , fur - trimmed dress she would wear when she finally skated with @entity0			1
" she never did get to do that , " @entity0 said			1
on his 17th birthday in 1942 , she asked him how it was going with a girl he had met			0
it was an ordinary letter that one keeps like any other			0
but it turned out to be her last to him , and he preserved it like a relic , as proof of his cousin 's affection , as something to treasure			2
" that was the last sign of life i had with @entity4 , " @entity0 told me			1
after the war , @entity75 searched frantically for his family and eventually learned their cruel fate			2
he published @entity4 's diary in 1947 and helped transform it for the stage and film			1
he created the foundation in her name in 1963			0
the first edition of the diary was in @entity126			0
@entity0 told me he had to wait several years for a @entity128 language edition before he could read it			2
that was when he came to truly understand his childhood playmate			0
by the time he read her words , he had not seen @entity4 in many years			2
in his mind , he treasured the image of a spunky girl who loved the @entity138 puppet shows @entity0 staged and played hide - and - seek			2
" @entity4 , " he said , " was always good at hiding			2
" i wondered whether he caught the irony of his own words			0
@entity75 kept alive his daughter 's legacy until he died in 1980 and passed on that role to @entity0			1
he was devoted to the task until the day he died			0
in 2012 , he helped create the @entity145 in @entity146 , where archives of his extended family will be made accessible to the public , according to the @entity4 foundation			2
@entity0 was my closest personal encounter with a girl who opened my eyes to the cruelty of this world			2
@entity4 never gave up on humanity , despite everything she endured			2
it was her goodness that amazes every reader of her diary			0
in @entity0 , i saw that same goodness .			0

@entity4 was *extremely* close to her first cousin @entity0
a discovery in @entity0 ' attic led to the a book revealing new *details* about @entity4 's famiy
@entity0 became the preserver of @entity4 's legacy after her father , @entity75 , died in 1980
