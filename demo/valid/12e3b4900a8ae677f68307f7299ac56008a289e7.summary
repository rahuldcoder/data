it 's called the @entity2 -- and the clue is in the name			1
with some 8,500 laborers working around the clock on its construction , the imposingly - named dam is surely one of @entity11 's most ambitious infrastructure projects , reaffirming @entity13 's ambitions of becoming a big regional player and a major exporter of power			1
when completed , the project will generate around 6,000 megawatts of electricity for both domestic use and exports			0
the most striking aspect of the nearly $ 5 billion enterprise is , however , that it is entirely funded by @entity13 , without any foreign investment			1
according to the authorities , 20 % of the project is financed from bond offerings to @entity13 , and the remaining 80 % from tax collection			2
" it was seen as a strategically important initiative that the government and the @entity13 people are financing it 100 % , " says @entity28 , managing partner at @entity29			1
" they have come up with a very creative and innovative way that i think will be a lesson for other @entity39 countries who want to embark on such large infrastructure projects , and want to have the flexibility to do it themselves , " he adds			0
hydroelectric powerhouse so far , @entity13 at home and abroad have contributed about $ 350 million , and the government says that the 170 meter tall dam is on track for a 2017 opening , with 40 % of the work already complete			1
@entity13 's per capita income might be one of the lowest in the world , but the country has enjoyed an impressive economic growth since 2000 , averaging 10.9 % annually , which has resulted in a 33 % reduction of people living in poverty			1
if the @entity2 and other hydroelectric projects , such as the @entity61 on the @entity62 , are completed on time , @entity59 estimates @entity13 could earn $ 1 billion a year from electricity exports			1
@entity28 says that this would make the country the largest exporter of power in @entity11 , and second only to @entity11 when it comes to installed capacity			1
unhappy neighbors yet , not everyone is happy about @entity13 's energetic drive to harness its water resources			1
the @entity2 is being built on @entity76 , a tributary of the @entity78 which has been powering the agriculture of @entity80 and @entity81 -- through which it flows -- for millennia			1
these countries have opposed the project in the past , fearing that the dam will reduce their share of the @entity78 water			0
the ousted @entity81 president @entity88 had even threatened to defend " each drop of @entity78 water with our blood if necessary " back in 2013			2
passions have been calmer more recently , and today the @entity95 news agency reported that representatives of @entity81 , @entity80 and @entity13 reached a preliminary agreement in @entity98 on how to operate the dam			1
@entity28 is convinced that a compromise will be reached , as he thinks that the dam will ultimately benefit not just @entity13 but most other @entity39 nations			2
" this is actually a regional project because up from @entity81 all the way down to @entity103 , countries are going to buy the power that 's generated by this dam , " @entity28 says , adding that both @entity103 and @entity104 have already agreed to purchase thousands of megawatts once the project is finished			2
a lack of reliable power has long stunted @entity11 's development , with 600 million people on the continent not connected to the grid and getting by on a mix of generators , kerosene lamps and candles			2
in @entity13 , only 15 to 20 % of the population has access to power according to a study by @entity125			0
" it 's @entity11 's achilles ' heel , " says @entity28			0
" with anyone who wants to build a factory in @entity11 , the first thing they ask is infrastructure , and within infrastructure , whether there is sufficient electricity			0
industrialization has always been about electricity , and this [ dam ] addresses this basic need			0
" he adds that , after depending on exporting raw commodities for decades , governments across @entity11 should be pursuing a strategy of industrialization , following the example of @entity144			0
" we 've got to move up the value chain , and it 's what @entity13 is doing right now			0
its strategy is industrial - based -- not to export commodities but to manufacture value - added things , and other @entity39 nations are trying to emulate that			0
but without electricity there wo n't be industrialization in @entity11			0

@entity13 is building the largest hydro - electric dam in @entity11
the country says the $ *5bn* @entity2 is funded entirely by the government and its people
neighboring @entity80 and @entity81 fear that the dam will affect their water supply
