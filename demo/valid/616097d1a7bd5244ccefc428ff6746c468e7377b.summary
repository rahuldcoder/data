you would be pressed to find a designer who appealed to the imagination as much as @entity4			1
a favorite with a-listers and fashion editors alike , he was renowned for his @entity9 sensibilities , innovative textiles ( think shells , horns and hair ) and highly conceptual runway shows , as well as his bad boy antics behind the scenes			0
( along with the usual drinks , drugs and parties , he once claimed to have stitched profanities into the lining of a jacket for @entity23			0
) five years after his death , interest in the designer has n't waned , least of all in his home town of @entity28 , where , starting this month , he 's being commemorated with an extensive , expensive retrospective at the @entity30			1
@entity4 : @entity31 , a re-staging of the 2011 exhibition at @entity35 's @entity34 , summarizes and contextualizes @entity4 's 18 - year career through an elaborate display of 244 garments and accessories			1
" @entity31 at the @entity30 is the largest and most ambitious fashion exhibition the museum has ever staged , " said curator @entity40 at a press preview			1
the @entity30 has already sold 70,000 advanced tickets , and extended the exhibition by two weeks to meet demand			1
at the @entity34 , @entity31 attracted over 660,000 visitors by the end of its four - month run , making it one of the museum 's top 10 exhibitions of all time , up there with a @entity55 stop in 1978 and a @entity57 loan in 1963			1
bringing @entity31 to @entity28 can be seen as a " homecoming , " as it was described by @entity30 director @entity59 at the press preview , if not an act of repatriation			1
the son of cab driver and a school teacher , @entity4 grew up in @entity28 's @entity66			1
after dropping out of school at 16 , he honed his tailoring skills on @entity69 , graduated with an ma in fashion design from the city 's prestigious @entity73 college , and used the @entity30 's archives to research his collections			2
he once said of @entity28 : " it 's where my heart is , and where i get my inspiration			2
" that love was largely reciprocated			0
in 2011 , thousands of @entity82 devotees petitioned to have @entity31 brought to @entity28 after its spectacular @entity35 debut			1
fashion journalist @entity84 was one of the most vocal proponents			0
a longtime fan , she has coauthored the upcoming release inferno : @entity4 ( @entity88 ) , a coffee table book of interviews and images from photographer @entity92 , which documents march 1996 collection @entity94			2
" i was agitated because ( @entity31 ) really is meant to be in his hometown , " @entity96 says			2
" everything about him is @entity28 , so to not have it in @entity28 would have been a crime			2
" along with hounding the brand 's corporate honchos and the @entity30 itself , @entity96 started an online petition to have the exhibition brought to the city , and instigated the @entity108 hashtag # @entity109			2
" it 's like the ( @entity111 ) @entity112 : they 're probably a lot more powerful in @entity114 than they are sitting in the @entity116			0
" ultimately , such advocacy may have been unnecessary			0
according to @entity119 , senior exhibition research assistant for @entity31 , it had been @entity59 's ambition to bring the exhibition to @entity28 since he assumed the directorship in september 2011			1
the @entity30 exhibition , which was announced last april , even begins with a newly added @entity28 gallery dedicated to @entity4 's roots in the city and his early shows			1
curators called on @entity129 , who produced all of @entity4 's shows from 1996 on , to act as the exhibition 's creative director and bring @entity4 's pieces to life			1
" a lot of ( @entity4 's ) colleagues say he started his collections with the concept of a show , " @entity119 says			0
" he always wanted people to have a strong reaction to what he was going			0
" the most theatrical highlights include the romantic @entity146 gallery , covered with fake bones like an ossuary , and a blacked - out room where a @entity151 hologram floats in a diaphanous dress , trapped in a glass pyramid			0
the room - sized @entity155 has 27 screens showing moments of his most imaginative runway shows : women walk on water , a model 's gown is spray - painted by robotic arms , a church is converted into a catwalk			0
but @entity119 believes the real draw will be the groundbreaking pieces made from unconventional materials , which blur the line between fashion and art. fairytale gowns feature throughout and there 's a whole section dedicated to @entity4 's tailoring skills , but it 's the garments made from razor clam shells , pheasant feathers , and synthetic hair ; or embellished with impala horns and baby crocodile heads that really standout			2
the accessories -- extravagant headpieces , @entity186 mesh chain mail , impossible shoes -- seem like sculptures			0
" @entity4 was an artist whose medium of expression was fashion , " she says			0
" he absolutely changed the way we look at fashion			0
" @entity4 : @entity31 runs from march 14 - august 2 , 2015 at the @entity30 in @entity28			1
