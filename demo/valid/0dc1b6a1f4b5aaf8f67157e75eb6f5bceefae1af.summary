researchers say dr. @entity2 may be a brain surgeon , but science shows he 's dead wrong about how sexual orientation works			1
wednesday on @entity1 , @entity2 , a retired neurosurgeon and potential @entity8 presidential candidate , said he " absolutely " believes being gay is a choice			1
but scientists say decades of research overwhelmingly shows sexual preference is inborn , not a choice			1
" it does n't seem to be the social environment , it does n't seem to be the parents or peers that make you gay , " said @entity15 , a lecturer in the department of psychology at the @entity18 in @entity19			2
" it seems to be something that comes from within			0
" " sexual orientation is biologically determined , " added @entity27 , a professor of psychology at the @entity29			2
" i do n't think any educated person aware of the research would argue differently			2
" in a statement wednesday , @entity2 apologized for what he said on @entity1 , and softened his words , saying the verdict is still out on whether people are born with their sexual preference			1
" i do not pretend to know how every individual came to their sexual orientation , " he added			0
while science is seldom definitive about anything , especially something as complicated as why we love who we love , researchers say the preponderance of the evidence shows sexual orientation is not chosen			1
they point to studies showing children are aware of their sexual orientation at a young age			0
plus , genetic studies suggest homosexuality runs in families			0
finally , researchers have found that the very structure of the brain -- specifically , regions of the hypothalamus -- differs in gay and heterosexual men			0
" ask a bunch of straight guys [ if they could switch to being gay ] and they would tell you , ' are you kidding me ? " @entity15 said			2
" so the other way around does n't work either			0
" so what was @entity2 's scientific support for his argument that being gay is a choice ? he pointed to prisons			1
" a lot of people who go into prison go into prison straight - and when they come out , they 're gay			2
so , did something happen while they were in there ? ask yourself that question , " @entity2 told @entity1 's @entity82			1
experts on sexual activity in prisons challenged the very premise of @entity2 's statement , calling it " preposterous " and " appalling			1
" " to , in any way , suggest that a person would go in as a heterosexual and then somehow become a homosexual as a result , that 's simply preposterous			0
there 's no evidence to support that , " said @entity95 , a mental health counselor who 's testified to the @entity98 about rape in prison			0
prisoners do engage in homosexual practices , but that does n't mean they 've gone from straight to gay , the experts said			1
prisoners are often raped , they say , or coerced to engage in sex in exchange for protection from violent prisoners			2
" they 're physically forced or forced through blackmail to engage in sex , " @entity27 said			0
" to have someone say this is chosen is just showing such great disregard for what we know about the world of sexual assault in prison			0
" opinion : prison does n't make people ' come out ' gay the prisoners who are perpetrating the rape are often either gay to begin with , or are heterosexual and rape to subjugate other prisoners			1
" it 's more about power than sex , " said @entity132 , a criminologist at the @entity133 who 's done extensive research on sexuality in prison			0
" these men do n't see what they 're doing as homosexual , and they will leave their incarceration heterosexual			1
" other prisoners do willingly engage in homosexual activity , but the experts say it 's more of a way to release sexual tension and have some degree of intimacy			1
" it does n't mean they would choose someone of the same gender in any other situation , " @entity27 said			0
critics of these studies point out other research they say indicates that orientation is a choice , namely studies that show sexual orientation can change over the course of a lifetime , and that " socialization " can alter orientation			1
overall , the scientists with whom we spoke said they were shocked at @entity2 's arguments			2
" i 'm deeply saddened on multiple levels that someone in the 21st century would take this position , " @entity95 said			0
@entity175 contributed to this report .			0
