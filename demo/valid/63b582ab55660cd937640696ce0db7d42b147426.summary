@entity3 diplomats have come under attack in various places in the last few decades			1
here 's a look at @entity3 diplomats who have been killed in the line of duty			1
the first @entity3 ambassador assassinated while in office was @entity11 , the @entity3 ambassador to @entity12			1
according to a telegram from the embassy in @entity15 , a young man dressed in fatigues and carrying a sub-machine gun on august 28 , 1968 , ordered @entity11 's vehicle to stop and for the ambassador to get out			0
he did , then ran -- prompting a cry of " shoot him , kill him			0
" @entity11 was shot and fell to the ground about 12 yards behind his limousine			0
@entity25 , the @entity3 ambassador to @entity26 , was nearing the end of a march 1973 reception in the @entity29 in @entity30 when terrorists stormed in			1
the gunmen took @entity25 and another @entity3 , as well as diplomats from @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 , according to a @entity3 intelligence memo			1
the captors ' demand : free various people , mostly @entity41 guerillas , then imprisoned in @entity36 , @entity42 and the @entity3			1
this spurred negotiations that did n't go anywhere , ending instead with the killing of @entity25 , fellow @entity3 diplomat @entity48 and @entity35 's @entity47			1
@entity3 authorities say the assailants belonged to the @entity41 terrorist movement known as " @entity52 , " claiming that @entity41 leader @entity53 signed off on the attack			1
ambassador @entity55 , who had been in @entity56 for less than months , hunkered down in a hallway on august 19 , 1974 , hoping he was safe from those involved in a nearby demonstration			0
instead , a bullet penetrated the embassy compound and struck his heart , killing him instantly			0
@entity63 , a 31 - year - old local who was part of the small embassy staff for about a decade , also died in the violence			1
@entity3 ambassador to @entity69 @entity68 , his economic counselor @entity71 and their @entity69 driver disappeared in june 1976 as they crossed the @entity75 , the division between @entity80 's @entity78 and @entity79 sectors			1
their bullet - riddled bodies were found a short time later in mainly @entity79 west @entity80 , which was then controlled by @entity84 chairman @entity53 's guerrillas			2
two former @entity79 guerillas were convicted in the kidnapping and killings , only to be freed in 1996			0
about eight months after president @entity89 appointed him as @entity3 ambassador to @entity91 , @entity88 was taken from his car while heading home from the embassy			1
his captors took the @entity97 veteran to the @entity98 , where @entity99 died in a shootout between captors and @entity91 police -- a violent death that , whomever fired the fatal bullets , the @entity106 considers an assassination			2
a former eight - story hotel facing the sea transformed into @entity3 's embassy in @entity80 turned into a war zone in april 1983 , when a truck loaded with explosives was rammed into its entrance			1
offices were pancaked on top of each other , the elevator shaft and stairwell destroyed , the cafeteria full of bodies and rubble , recalled the then @entity3 ambassador @entity124 , who himself was dug out of the rubble			1
while 44 people inside the embassy survived the blast , 17 @entity3 , 25 @entity97 nationals , 10 contract workers and 10 visa applicants and passerby did not			1
in 2008 , @entity124 said the attack was believed to have been carried out by a family " under the direction of members of @entity137 's @entity136			0
" on august 7 , 1998 -- around the exact same time a bomb went off at the @entity139 in @entity140 , @entity141 , killing 11 -- a huge explosion tore through the @entity143 in @entity144 , @entity145			0
the @entity146 ( @entity146 ) lists eight people as having died in the attack on its memorial remembering @entity3 who died while serving the @entity3 government abroad in a foreign affairs capacity			1
twelve @entity3 total were killed			2
those are both jarring numbers , but they 're still a fraction of the more than 200 people total killed in the attack , in addition to more than 4,000 wounded			0
in may 2001 , a @entity3 jury found four purported @entity162 members guilty on all charges stemming from the embassy bombings in @entity145 and @entity141			2
as his wife of 34 years looked on , @entity165 was shot dead outside his home in @entity168 , @entity36 , by a lone gunman in december 2002			0
a public servant for close to 40 years , the @entity170 - born @entity165 was serving as executive officer of the @entity174 mission in @entity168 at the time			0
@entity3 officials were quick to label @entity165 's killing a murder , with the head of the @entity146 calling it a " brutal terrorist attack			2
" they later implicated @entity180 - based terrorist leader @entity179 for providing " financial and other support to the terrorists who assassinated " @entity165			0
exactly 11 years after the september 11 attacks in @entity185 , @entity186 and rural @entity187 , terrorists struck at @entity3 again -- this time some 5,000 miles away in the @entity189 city of @entity190			2
that 's where ambassador @entity192 was when mortar and rocket fire struck a @entity3 diplomatic annex there			1
@entity192 did n't survive , nor did @entity106 computer expert @entity197 or @entity198 and @entity199 , two former @entity200 then acting as security contractors			2
the attack was first portrayed as violence by an angry mob responding to a video made in the @entity3 that mocked @entity206 and the @entity207			2
but officials later determined that it was a terrorist attack			0
@entity210 , a 25 - year - old public diplomacy officer at the @entity143 in @entity98 , was delivering books to a school in southern @entity91 when a suicide bomber smashed into her convoy			0
she died in that april 2013 attack , as did four others			0
" we thought she was relatively safe in the embassy compound , " her father @entity217 told @entity1			0
" but as it turned out , @entity210 really wanted to do a lot more			0
