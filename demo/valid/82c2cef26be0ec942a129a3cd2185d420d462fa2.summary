if you think " my teen would never sext , " you might be mistaken			2
and if you think the only teens who sext are the ones engaging in high - risk behaviors , like drinking , using drugs or skipping school , keep reading			1
studies suggest that sexting is more common than many parents might realize or want to admit			1
more than half the undergraduate students who took part in an anonymous online survey said they sent sexually suggestive texts when they were teenagers , according to the study by @entity19 , which was published last year by the @entity20			1
nearly 30 % said they included photos in their sexts , and an astonishing 61 % did not know that sending nude photos via text could be considered child pornography			2
another study , this one by the @entity26 at @entity27 , found that while students who admitted sexting were 32 % more likely to report having sex the next year , sexting by teenagers was not linked to risky sexual behavior over time			1
the study , published in the journal @entity36 , found that teens who sexted were not more likely to have multiple sexual partners , use drugs or alcohol before sex or not use birth control			1
sexting may be the new " normal ' when it comes to adolescent sexual behavior , the study concluded			1
" there are now a few pieces of research , which are sort of converging on the same finding , namely that this is not a rare behavior , " said @entity46 , a professor of psychology at @entity48 and director of the @entity50			2
" i 'm not saying that it 's healthy or that it 's harmless , but it 's not a situation where kids who are depressed are doing this or kids who have very bad self - esteem are doing it , " said @entity46 , who researched sexting , as well as a host of other teenager behaviors , for her recent book " @entity60			1
" " it appears to be widespread			2
it 's engaged in by many kids who are functioning well and not having problems and it 's not very unusual or rare			2
" you 're probably thinking : " i check my kids ' phones			0
no sexting happening in this household			1
" but there are plenty of apps teens can use to send messages their parents ca n't find later			1
@entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and others allow users to send messages that disappear on both the sender and recipient 's phones after a certain period of time			1
these apps are used by kids and adults alike to send a variety of messages -- from perfectly harmless to potentially dangerous			1
brutally honest : is it ok to spy on your kids ? @entity104 , who teaches " cyber civics " to middle schoolers in @entity106 , @entity107 , was blown away by the response she got from eighth graders when she , for the first time , included a session on sexting			1
when she asked her students if they knew what a sext was , everyone in the class said they did , but what they did n't know was what the penalties for sending a sext could be , including how it could be prosecuted as a felony under child pornography laws in some states			0
" they had no idea what the consequences were , " said @entity104 , co-founder of @entity127 , a digital literacy site for parents , educators , and tweens and teens			1
" i mean that was a complete surprise to literally all 28 kids , so it occurred to me that no one 's ever bothered to tell these kids they could n't do that			0
" @entity104 said she experienced another first that day			0
a few students wanted to hang around after the class , which is held at the end of the school day , to talk more about sexting and related things			1
" that 's never happened to me before with this class ... and i realized that i had created a safe space for them to talk about something that was super relevant to their lives			0
" she now plans to make it part of her " cyber civics " curriculum , and believes parents and educators need to be talking to kids at even younger ages about sexting			1
it should be part of sex education , she said			0
" we know that throwing the book at them , it 's too much too late , so that 's not working , " said @entity104 , who offers tips for parents on how to help children have safe online relationships			1
" it 's very normal teenage behavior ... and we need to get with the times and get ahead of the problem , and just have these very easy to have discussions			0
" @entity46 , the psychology professor and researcher , says in her experience , it 's not that adults are n't warning teens about the criminal consequences for underage sexting or how devastating it could be to a teen if their nude photo became public			1
the problem , she says , is kids do n't hear the warnings because the reality does n't fit them			0
in a online article , she used an example of telling someone to use a seat belt because half the car rides in the country result in someone going through the windshield			0
since half of car rides do n't result in someone going through the windshield , a person might not listen to that warning , she says			0
" if you want to convince somebody that something is a danger , you have to convince them that you know what you 're talking about , " said @entity46			0
" so you ca n't say to kids ' oh , you are going to go to jail if you sext			0
' it 's not 100 % impossible but even in the early cases of sexting , when ( law enforcement ) did prosecute kids , they did n't go to jail			1
" " people have a hard time with this			0
it 's not that i 'm saying we should n't teach kids that child pornography is a crime			0
it is a crime , but if we emphasize that that 's the big danger then we 've lost our audience			0
" @entity46 said what she is most troubled by is not how widespread sexting might be but how teens feel after they sext , especially if they felt pressured to do it			1
in her own research , she said she found that 92 % of the teens who said they were not pressured to sext reported no problems afterward , but that number is only 68 % for teens who felt pressured into doing it			1
" they felt crummy afterwards , " said @entity46			0
" that was actually the most common result , that they just felt worse			1
" @entity252 , founder of @entity253 , a site specializing in simplifying technology for families , said parents need to remind their children about their own self - worth			2
" and that no matter how tempting it is to want to be ' liked ' by someone , they are worth more than degrading themselves for someone else 's enjoyment , " said @entity252 , a mom of two in @entity261			0
" if parents are n't having this conversation , their kids could be going through some tremendous pressure			2
" @entity252 also says parents need to be actively involved in their children 's online lives			2
in an @entity275 , she outlines the points parents should go over with their child when they get a phone , including setting up a contract so they understand their phone will be monitored			2
" phones are a privilege , not a right			0
they should only be given to kids with the expectation that mom or dad will be checking it on a daily basis			0
" what all the experts believe is that parents and educators should be talking to kids about obeying the law , protecting their privacy and reputation , and respecting everyone 's right to keep their bodies private , but also their own values about the issue			2
" your kids can go into these things knowing absolutely nothing , having no idea of what you think is right or wrong , having no idea of the facts or you can talk to them about it			0
those are the only two choices , " said @entity46			0
" i do n't think in today 's world you can assume that they 're never going to run across sexting , they 're never going to see it , they 're never going to know it happens			2
" " that 's a big assumption to make			0

sexting is more common than parents might realize , studies suggest
