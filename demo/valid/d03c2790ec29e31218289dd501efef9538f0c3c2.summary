@entity3 's lawyerly news conference tuesday , at which she doggedly parried suggestions that her use of a private email server to conduct official @entity9 business was improper , might extinguish the matter for most @entity11 -- but it does n't get @entity12 out of the woods politically			1
the real possibility of lasting political damage to the former secretary of state will come if her emails reveal any favoritism to any of the foreign donors who contributed to the welter of powerful charitable organizations housed at the @entity22			1
this is the multibillion - dollar foundation @entity3 leads alongside ex-president @entity12 and their daughter , @entity26			1
what we already know about the foundation 's donors is controversial : some of the corporations , banks and foreign governments that have funded foundation projects have abysmal human rights records and have been involved in everything from drug money laundering to aiding terrorism in violation of @entity11 law			1
the @entity41 can make a plausible case that it 's best to solicit money from companies and foreign governments -- even ethically challenged ones -- and put it to good use attacking problems of global poverty			1
as @entity12 recently told reporters : " you 've got to decide when you do this work whether it will do more good than harm if someone helps you from another country			0
" it 's an interesting and important debate , and most @entity11 would probably approve the idea of putting " bad " money to good use			2
but the argument only works if @entity12 's work as secretary of state was completely separate from the foundation 's tip - toeing around ethical challenges			1
to figure that out requires analyzing the history of what began as the @entity22 shortly after he left office in 2001			0
different initiatives were added over the years to combat @entity69 , climate change , poverty and other ills ; the most high - profile of these projects , the @entity74 , added in 2005 , brings world leaders together to tackle the world 's problems			2
to make things even more complicated , the foundation 's website says its mission is supported by the @entity82 in @entity83 , which includes an archive of the president 's papers			2
the foundation recently co-sponsored a @entity89 month event with the center			0
the foundation 's thicket of relationships with corporate donors and foreign heads of states is difficult for outsiders to penetrate and understand			1
and with 350 employees spread across 180 nations , running the foundation is an expensive proposition : in 2012 , the various initiatives spent $ 214 million according to the @entity103 but still ended up $ 8 million in the red			0
who gave , and why , is hard to figure out			0
according to @entity108 , " the @entity22 does disclose its donors , which is n't required by law			2
but the disclosure is limited ; dates and exact amount of the donations are n't disclosed			0
donations are listed in value ranges and updated annually with only the previous year 's donor getting an asterisk by his or her name			2
" @entity3 and @entity12 have put some safeguards in place to put distance between her job as secretary of state and the inner workings of the foundation			1
during @entity3 's years as secretary of state , the high - profile @entity74 split off from the larger @entity22 , and @entity12 says he had no direct involvement in its day - to - day operations			1
@entity3 also stayed away from the foundation during her time at the @entity9 and agreed to subject possible conflicts to the department 's ethics office			1
it was only after she resigned that she formally joined the foundation and added her name to its title			0
ideally that would settle the matter , but there 's the possibility that the elaborate formal safeguards may have been breached or ignored			2
an investigation by @entity108 found that " at least 60 companies that lobbied the @entity9 during her tenure donated a total of more than $ 26 million to the @entity22 , " raising questions about whether the firms were using the donations to curry favor with the secretary of state			2
in one well - publicized case , @entity3 pressed a state - owed @entity156 airline to buy @entity11 planes from @entity158			1
the effort worked : @entity158 ended up with a $ 3.7 billion contract			0
( to be sure , secretaries of state are always lobbying foreign countries to purchase @entity11 products			2
it 's part of their job			0
) but weeks after @entity12 's persuasion ( what she called a " shameless pitch " ) , @entity158 donated $ 900,000 to the foundation			0
a @entity4 investigation by @entity173 recently showed that half a dozen banks that gave money to the @entity22 were involved in ethically questionable behavior and might have used donations to the foundation and / or its @entity74 spinoff as a way to gain favor with the @entity41 and enhance their tarnished reputations			0
in 2012 , the @entity184 bank @entity183 paid $ 667 million in fines for violating sanctions against @entity187 and @entity188 paid $ 1.92 billion to settle claims of illegally doing business for customers in @entity192 , @entity187 , @entity193 and @entity194 and allowing drug dealers to launder money through the bank			0
both banks have been major contributors to the foundation			0
as @entity204 notes , " the fact that the foundation partnered with banks that were actively under investigation raises questions over what restrictions , if any , the foundation placed on its fundraising operation			0
" and according to the @entity209 , seven nations donated millions to the foundation during @entity12 's time as secretary of state , including a $ 500,000 gift from @entity214 that the foundation failed to clear in advance through the @entity9 's ethics office			1
that sort of corner - cutting , and the cozy - seeming connections between @entity12 and various corporations and governments , will be tough to explain on the campaign trail			0
if emails suggest @entity12 was aware of the corporations , banks and nations sending money to her foundation during her time at the @entity9 -- or worse , took action to help encourage the flow of donations -- the issue would almost certainly derail her likely presidential campaign			1
it 's much too early to count @entity3 out , of course			1
the @entity41 can credibly argue that the money they collected has funded more than a billion dollars ' worth of good works , from lowering the price of hiv - fighting drugs in developing countries to advancing green technology and educating girls and women			0
but there 's no scenario in which voters can be expected to ignore or support the former secretary of state if she is shown to have been simultaneously arranging pay - to - play deals with businesses and governments seeking help or favors from the @entity11 government while she was in office			1
what will matter is not why or how @entity3 stored her emails but whether the actual emails show her in ethical quicksand from which no presidential candidate can escape .			1

@entity264 : bigger question than kind of email used is whether @entity3 's emails show favoritism for donors
he says some corporations and foreign nation donors stained by sanctions for illegal behavior
louis : if voters see a quid pro *quo* from the former secretary of state 's emails , it could derail her candidacy
