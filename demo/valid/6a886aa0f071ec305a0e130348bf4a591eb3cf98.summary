@entity0 had a big decision to make earlier this year , and she wanted to run it by her parents			1
she wanted to see whether they would support her going back to @entity6 , @entity7 , to play in a tournament she had skipped 13 times since winning in 2001			1
the last time she was there , she had been booed loudly and lustfully			2
the fans were upset and sensed some sort of conspiracy that she did n't have to face her talented older sister in the semifinals			2
@entity18 had withdrawn 10 minutes before their match with a knee injury			1
many fans did n't buy it and thought it was orchestrated to give the younger @entity0 a chance for extra rest			1
two days later , during the championship match , @entity0 , 19 at the time , was jeered when she did well and cheered when she fared poorly			1
then days after the tournament , which she won , her father , @entity29 , told @entity31 that as he and @entity18 walked down the stairs to their seats , people kept calling him the n - word and one man said : " i wish it was ' 75 ; we 'd skin you alive			1
" neither @entity0 nor @entity18 has played in the tennis tournament since			1
that will end friday when @entity0 , the world no. 1 , faces @entity41 , the 68th - ranked player in a second - round match			1
the end of the boycott took a lot of conversations with a lot of people , @entity0 told reporters thursday			1
two of the most important were with her parents			0
" it was a really emotional time for me , " she said , saying the prospect of the talks made her a little nervous			0
she told them she would n't go back if they did n't want her to go			0
but they both said to play			0
her dad said it would be a big mistake not to come back , she said			0
@entity0 said her mother said , " i will be there for you			2
" @entity18 , the no. 11 singles player , is n't playing in the tournament , but @entity0 said her older sister was 100 % behind her			1
she is " very happy that i am here			0
and even encouraged me to come , " @entity0 said			2
@entity0 announced her return to the event in a @entity67 first - person piece in february , writing she would ended her boycott in the spirit of forgiveness			2
she said thursday that she did n't just have to forgive the fans at @entity6			0
" in order to forgive , you have to be able to really let go of everything			0
i kind of let go a long time ago , and i kind of forgave , but i was n't at point where i was ready to come back , " she said			0
the timing seemed right this year , she said			0
she added that she will be a little nervous in her first match at the @entity79			0
still she was " looking forward actually to kind of stepping out on center court and letting the whole world know that it does n't matter what you face -- whether it 's something that was n't right , something that hurt you , hurt your family			1
you can just come out and be strong			2
" @entity1 's @entity88 and @entity89 contributed to this report .			0

in 2001 , her father said the family was the subject of racial *slurs*
neither @entity0 or @entity18 has played in the tournament since
@entity0 says playing shows the world you can be strong in the face of *intolerance*
