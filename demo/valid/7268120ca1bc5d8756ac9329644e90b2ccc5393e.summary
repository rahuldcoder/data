when i was a child , a pale specter used to call our house most evenings , eager to chat with my doctor father about her myriad medical concerns			1
we called her the " @entity10 , " a moniker she earned for one particularly inane call in which she panicked to my father after consuming white bread			1
she was n't breaking out in hives or having any adverse effects to the bread			2
no , she was just concerned that some future illness could befall her given that one particular dietary decision			2
although we all laughed at the time , it was with a bit of shifty - eyed shame			2
because most of us ( including if not particularly the illustrious @entity26 family ) have lurking within us our very own " @entity10 , " ready to convince us that each cough , sniffle and less - than - nutritious meal might be a detriment to our health			1
and , naturally , that @entity10 looms even larger when we can type our worries into a search bar and unlock a bevy of potentially distressing information			2
yup , so quoth @entity36 , we all have cancer			2
according to the @entity39 , 80 % of internet users have looked up health information online			1
while that practice can be beneficial in some respects , the abundance of ( variably valid ) information online can turn us into e-hypochondriacs			1
( or , worse , can lead us to neglect getting the care we need			2
) read on for five mistakes -- courtesy of a selection of health care professionals -- that people make when diagnosing themselves online			1
searching blind your eye is twitching like an overly caffeinated college student sitting behind a pretty girl in lecture hall , twirling his pencil and hoping to catch a whiff of her lovely shining hair			2
you type " eye twitch " into @entity36 and come up with a really rad website that explains that this newfound spasm is actually an indication that your third eye is fixing to open , revealing to you wonders untold			2
you are the chosen one			2
too bad that this trove of " medical information " is actually some dude 's fan - fiction site			2
sure , the above is an extreme example , but , as dr. @entity74 of @entity75 pointed out , " there 's a lot of bad information on the @entity79 and information that can be dangerous			0
" especially if you 're not considering who put up that information in the first place			0
pho urges users to favor web addresses ending in			1
edu when looking for reputable health - care info , and to check who is funding the collection of that information			1
" there 's so much information from organizations trying to sell products or push their agenda on the @entity79 , " he said			0
he suggests turning to sites like @entity98 as well as troves of information curated by doctors ( like @entity84 's own website ) when trolling the web for info			1
and , of course , if a site mentions trolls and third eyes , one should definitely press on			0
flailing in forums if there 's one thing people like to do online , it 's talk about their problems -- especially mundane things like coughs and headaches and their babies ' various and sundry discharges			1
that 's all well and good ; sharing experiences with others is enriching ! unless the people you 're sharing with are idiots			0
" you can easily fall into that rabbit hole and find some forum that really is n't relevant but maybe sounds kind of close , " warned @entity124 , co-founder of symptom - checker app @entity125			0
on the other hand , " sometimes you 'll stumble on exactly the right forum where someone has your same exact problem , and their solution does help			0
" " health care forums are definitely another tool that individuals can use in order to crowdsource a diagnosis based on their symptoms , " added dr. @entity137 of @entity138 " i think that these can be a really powerful tool not only for discussing potential diagnosis or symptom relief but also finding a forum of individuals in which you can discuss emotional and psychological parts of an illness and develop a wonderful online support community			1
" the trick is to be wary about the issues being discussed in forums and how germane they are to you			1
and , you know , if people start talking about homemade remedies fashioned from bleach , maybe click off and see a doc. getting emotional you know that game " 6 degrees of @entity166 " ? there should seriously be a version of that called " 6 @entity170 " -- as in , when looking up your symptoms online , how long does it take to deduce that you have a life - threatening disease instead of , say , a simple cold ? according to @entity137 , the root of this whole " worst - case scenario " thing is getting too emotional			1
" for most intents and purposes , when you 're looking for online health information , it 's about yourself or a family member , " she said			1
" when you 're looking through that lens , it 's very hard to keep emotional distance			0
so you can read about a diagnosis that either makes you very scared or calms your fears -- and that 's the path you 'll continue down , whether it 's correct or not			0
" @entity137 suggested using online symptom checkers simply to " understand possible diagnoses , find some initial steps for relieving the symptoms and determine if this is something that needs further evaluation or that can be managed at home			1
" @entity125 and @entity98 's symptom checker let you type in what you 're experiencing and unearth a spectrum of diagnoses and suggestions for when to seek a doctor 's aid			1
your doctor 's website might also have such a tool			0
@entity208 , you just increased your separation from cancer by at least a couple of degrees			0
keeping mum around @entity214 " i think , traditionally , many physicians are a little apprehensive when that stereotypical patient comes to their office with big stacks of printouts from the @entity220 , " @entity74 said			0
" but i think more and more doctors are accepting it			1
personally , i think that transparency of information is helpful in a way			0
" translation : help your doctor help you			0
if you 're worried about a particular medical situation and did some research to help narrow down what 's ailing you , share that info with your physician			1
" i really appreciate when patients bring in information that they found online , because it allows me to guide my instruction and plan based on their true concerns , " @entity137 said			1
" people get scared when they get sick and hurt , and they want to use multiple sources of information to help themselves			0
the @entity220 adds to that physician 's expertise in order to do that			0
" remember , though , knowing how to use the @entity220 does n't make you a doctor			0
@entity36 does n't count as a second opinion			0
if you 're unhappy with your doc 's diagnosis , go get one the traditional way			0
putting off the inevitable if your ailment is n't going away , all the symptom - checking and @entity98 - ing in the world is n't going to help you			1
make a doctor 's appointment			0
sites like @entity261 make it super easy ( and free ; doctors pay to be listed ) to set up an appointment asap , so no whining that you 'll have to wait two weeks to see a doc and maybe by then " it " will have gone away			1
unless , of course , " it " is that white bread you just ate			0
in that case , please stop calling my dad .			0

according to a @entity39 report , 80 % of internet users have looked up health info online
sites like @entity98 and others curated by doctors are safer than online forums
