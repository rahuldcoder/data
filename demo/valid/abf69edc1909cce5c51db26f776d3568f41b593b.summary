@entity0 is challenging an @entity3 law that will force those under 18 seeking an abortion to go through an adversarial process that 's akin to a trial			1
generally , laws in the @entity9 require parental consent for a minor to obtain an abortion			1
but for some children , parental consent is impossible or even dangerous			1
this class of minors must seek a judicial bypass			2
while the bypass is a common feature of abortion laws in other states , this @entity3 law may have gone too far			1
here are the suspect provisions of this " bypass by trial " : @entity3 has turned what is supposed to be an informal , child - centered hearing into more of a trial			1
the court can appoint a @entity29 ad litem -- normally an appointed lawyer for a child in , say , a divorce proceeding or a hearing involving unfit parents -- for the fetus			1
the minor may be cross-examined by the district attorney and possibly the minor 's parents			2
information about the minor 's pregnancy may be disclosed to her family , friends and employers , and they might even be brought to court to testify -- against the minor			2
when it comes to abortion , minors are supposed to enjoy the same constitutional right of privacy as adults , free from undue state interference			2
however , the @entity56 has also specifically articulated reasons why the constitutional rights of children are not identical to the rights of adults			0
children are vulnerable and unable to make critical decisions and , of course , parents have a right to participate in raising their child			0
states may pass laws that subject minors seeking an abortion to an additional requirement : parental involvement			1
however , if the state chooses to require parental consent for a pregnant minor to get an abortion , the state also must provide an alternative procedure for obtaining that authorization -- one that " bypasses " having to get @entity83 's permission			1
the @entity56 has required that these hearings " must assure that resolution ... be completed with anonymity and sufficient expedition to provide an effective opportunity for an abortion to be obtained			2
" @entity91 , and perhaps most importantly , the procedure bypassing parental consent can not be a thinly veiled mechanism for an " absolute , and possibly arbitrary , veto			1
" in plain language , hearings must be quick and quiet , and they can not be held in kangaroo court			2
the problem is , this does not give a lot of detailed direction to courts about how exactly to conduct these hearings			0
it 's not surprising that court procedures vary wildly , and that sooner or later , a state like @entity3 would experiment with state abortion law			1
our system was specifically designed to allow states to experiment with social and economic legislation			0
of course , that state prerogative is also tempered by a federal court 's power to strike these laws down if they are unconstitutional			2
in this case , the @entity116 's position is that creating an adversarial hearing goes too far			1
a hearing is fine , it seems , but something approaching a trial rises to the level of an impermissible " undue burden " on the right to have an abortion			1
this has been defined by the courts as placing a substantial obstacle in the path of the adult , or minor child seeking the abortion			2
the federal court that reviews these state statutes will be charged with determining whether @entity3 's law violates established @entity56 bypass requirements			1
but what about the actual bypass requirements themselves ? they are a creation of the @entity56			0
striking down an act of a state legislature is one thing -- challenging settled @entity56 precedent is entirely another			0
what if the constitutional standards for bypass procedures contain something of an intrinsic paradox ? consider how it applies in this case			0
in @entity3 , a judge at one of these hearings is required to waive the parental consent requirement if the judge finds either : ( 1 ) that the minor is mature and well - informed enough to make the abortion decision on her own ; or ( 2 ) that performance of the abortion would be in the best interest of the minor			1
abstract concepts like " mature " and " best interest " are rather amorphous at best			0
( true story : a respected law professor advised many classes of students that when confronted on the bar exam with a question about a child , do the following : write " best interest of the child " somewhere in the first sentence ; then write " whatever the heck you want " for the rest of the answer			0
) so then , the court must determine whether the minor is mature -- mature enough that she may have the court 's permission to have an abortion			1
this means the court can then arrive at this kafkaesque , perplexing alternative : a particular minor is too immature to have an abortion -- with the result being that this immature minor ... should therefore be ... a parent of an infant ? it gets stranger : what about a finding that it is in the best interest of the young mother to have the baby , even though she is deemed too immature to have an abortion ? how would it be in the best interest of the immature mother to have a child ? state courts and legislatures are not completely to blame ; after all , the law of minors and juveniles is always going to be about some difficult but arbitrary line - drawing			1
whether we 're considering the drinking age , the driving age or the voting age , we 've learned over the centuries that kids mature at different ages			0
plus there is no easy legal formula to address the myriad situations of messed - up families			0
unfortunately , legislatures must draw some lines -- lines that will not always be workable in every situation			0
and there are surely situations where the bypass might actually be effective : for example , a very young pregnant minor with completely absent parents , who needs court intervention			2
the problem is , if it creates an undue burden in one situation , then it 's constitutionally suspect			0
but ultimately , building up the procedural hurdles for a pregnant minor almost by definition encroaches upon the limits set some time ago by the @entity56			0
it 's a procedure that needs to be defined ; teen pregnancy certainly is n't going anywhere anytime soon			0
neither are lousy families , unfortunately			0
whether the boundary lines of judicial bypass ebb toward the autonomy of minors , or back toward the state interest in the fetus , the broader social " findings " of judicial bypass proceedings will always remain the same : it 's all very sad .			0

@entity255 : @entity3 may go too far in the process used to decide if a teenager can have an abortion without parental consent
he says a court hearing makes sense , but an adversarial process , like a trial , is questionable
