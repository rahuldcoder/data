when @entity4 @entity3 running back @entity2 retired recently at just 29 years old , he said his life had been focused on football for 24 years and he needed a change			1
it 's no wonder he wanted out			1
he has been playing football since he was 5 years old			1
sound too young to strap on a helmet ? not really			2
@entity14 - @entity2 is no different from thousands of other boys whose parents introduce them to the gridiron just a few years out of diapers			2
football is @entity21 's favorite sport			1
we pride ourselves on our toughness , on our ability to get back up when we 're knocked down			0
what better sport is there to teach those lessons ? but today , youth football is not looking like the best option			1
in 2012 , an estimated 225,287 children -- down 9.5 % since 2010 -- between the ages of 5 and 14 played @entity33 football , in which the weight class for the 5 - year - olds ranges from 35 to 79 pounds			2
with such lightweight boys competing with children more than twice their size , it 's no wonder parents feel less inclined to put their kids in this sport			1
but not too long ago , parents thought nothing of sending their children out on the football field to run around and burn up a little energy			1
many parents still insist youth football is safe			1
what could be healthier for a boy ? certainly , it beats sitting in front of a computer all day			0
that 's exactly what @entity56 thought when she signed up her son , @entity58 , for @entity33 football in @entity59 , then later in @entity60 , when he was 11 years old , in 1997			1
if only she knew then that her son would be dead at 25			0
@entity58 hung himself in his mother 's shed on june 7 , 2012			2
his brain was later found to have severe @entity64 , a degenerative brain disease that has been linked to concussions in football			2
@entity58 had played sports , including wrestling , pole vaulting and football most of his young life			1
but he spent almost four years playing @entity33 football from ages 11 to 14			2
" my son was the class comedian , loved school , always fun to be around , " @entity56 told me			0
" but we noticed after high school @entity58 changed			0
he got depressed , angry , paranoid and withdrew from sports and his friends			0
we just did n't know why			0
after learning about @entity64 , i knew he had it even before we got the results			0
the symptoms were all there			0
" @entity56 is convinced those early days playing @entity33 football triggered her son 's cte			1
last month , @entity56 and her son 's estate filed a lawsuit against @entity33 football for $ 5 million , claiming the nonprofit failed to protect its youngest players and warn them and their parents about the permanent dangers of head trauma			1
the lawsuit further alleges that @entity56 's son and other children were intentionally put in danger because @entity33 used amateur coaches with short tenures , who were never properly trained in the game of football , injury prevention , concussion or head injury identification			1
so now , this mother is on a mission			0
she wants to stop children younger than 14 from playing tackle football in youth leagues			1
" i do n't want any kids to suffer the way my son suffered , the way my family suffered			2
young children should not be allowed to play tackle football until they reach high school , " said @entity56			1
since filing her suit , @entity56 , a registered nurse , said she 's found some solace by connecting with other parents who want to make football safer for children , but she also has received plenty of hateful emails criticizing her for allowing her son to play in the first place			1
critics say that she knew what she was doing when she signed her son up to play football and some even suggest that @entity56 should be charged with murder for allowing @entity58 to sign up for football , @entity56 told me , clearly upset			2
" i did n't sign my son up to get a brain disease , " she said			0
" we wanted him to play sports , to be active			0
we knew nothing about concussions then			0
it was n't discussed much			0
it 's still not talked about enough today			2
should we all be arrested for letting our kids play football ? " clearly , the lawsuit faces obstacles , especially since @entity58 did play other sports and it may be hard to prove the @entity64 was triggered by injuries suffered while playing for @entity33			1
but @entity56 and her attorney , @entity148 , at the @entity149 , which is representing @entity58 's estate , insist this case is not just about winning			2
they are going after the economics of youth football leagues			1
and if they win the lawsuit it may be less possible for those leagues to buy the insurance policies that allow very young children to play tackle football			1
" we have to prove that @entity33 was a substantial factor in him getting it [ @entity64 ] , and we knew from research that playing under 12 is when you 're most vulnerable , " @entity148 told media when he filed the suit			0
" the airing of these issues will benefit everybody , " he added			0
@entity171 , executive director of @entity33 , told me on thursday via email : " @entity33 has been , and will continue to be , at the forefront of addressing player safety			0
... while there is incredible sadness in this story , we question the merits of singling out four years of youth football amid a career of sports that lasted through high school			1
" still , when the lawyer talk is done , @entity56 wo n't get her son back			0
and amazingly , she did not sound bitter			0
and she 's not out to end football			1
but " a 5 - year - old playing football , it 's ridiculous to have them out there banging their brains around			1
" some good has come out of all this , said @entity195			0
more people are talking about @entity64			0
she said it 's important that parents listen closely to nflers like 24 - year - old @entity201 , the @entity202 49ers linebacker who retired this week after just one season			1
@entity201 said he quit because he was afraid of brain injuries			0
he understands how his decision may affect parents and he has a message : " parents ... if you weigh the risk and decide this is something you want to partake in			2
... it 's a free country			2
... but if i could relay a message to kids and their parents it would be twofold : number one : make an informed decision			1
and number two : do n't play through concussions			0
who knows how many hits is too many ? " considering the consequences , it just may be one of the toughest decisions a parent has to make .			0

@entity230 : there 's a reason why young @entity3 players are retiring from the sport
she says youth football is not looking like the best option for kids ; parents should know the risks
