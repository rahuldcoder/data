@entity1 , @entity2 nuclear talks intensified sunday between world powers and @entity5 , but key sticking points remained unresolved as the countries tried to reach a deal to curb @entity10 's nuclear program ahead of a tuesday deadline			1
as the negotiations entered their fourth day , @entity13 prime minister @entity12 warned the agreement coming together is worse than @entity13 's deepest fears			1
the talks had hit a snag on saturday , with diplomats describing @entity5 as refusing to budge , but as the @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 foreign ministers arrived , the mood seemed more optimistic			1
the @entity25 and @entity26 foreign ministers were expected late sunday			0
@entity28 officials and @entity30 diplomats described the negotiations as tough and intense , which was expected as the talks reached the endgame			0
they said the contours of a deal are becoming clearer , but they were unsure it could be reached			2
two core issues are still unresolved : 1 ) limits on @entity5 research and development on advanced nuclear technology in the end years of the deal ; and 2 ) the pace of lifting @entity45 sanctions			1
the @entity28 officials stressed all of the elements were interrelated and nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to , comparing the final deal to a puzzle			2
but they indicated most of the other elements were solvable if those two major hurdles could be overcome			0
the speed of which @entity45 sanctions could be lifted remains in dispute			1
@entity5 wants them lifted immediately after the deal goes into effect			1
while diplomats say @entity5 could see unilateral sanctions relief in the areas of trade , oil and banking , sanctions adopted by the @entity45 are more complicated			1
many are related to proliferation and transfer of missile technology and are tied to certification by the @entity45 nuclear watchdog , the @entity74 , that @entity5 's nuclear program does not have a military dimension			1
on saturday , @entity5 foreign minister @entity77 made clear the issue of sanctions remains a stumbling block , saying he believes the world powers " have realized that sanctions , pressure and an agreement will not go together			1
it 's only to translate that understanding and realization into the agreement that we are negotiating			0
" @entity28 officials said that all sides , including @entity5 , agree that sanctions would be lifted in phases over time as @entity5 confirms its compliance to the deal			1
but they acknowledge there is still disagreement on the actual formula			0
@entity5 also wants the ability to continue to research and develop more advanced centrifuges while the deal is in effect			1
those machines can enrich uranium much faster than its current machines			0
@entity28 and @entity108 officials worry that could enable @entity5 to quickly produce enough uranium for a nuclear weapon			1
diplomats say the first 10 years of the 15 year deal would have the most stringent restrictions , with others being relaxed over the next five			0
" we will see if they are ready to swallow what we proposed , " a @entity30 diplomat said			0
" we are not asking them to do nothing , but they want to do more than we want them to do " referring to how much research the @entity5 want to be able to still undertake			1
but the diplomat added , " after 15 years , they can do what they want			0
" a senior @entity5 diplomat told @entity3 on sunday : " it 's not fair to characterize the state of affairs as @entity5 resistance on those issues			1
it can also be characterized as the other side 's intransigence in the talks			0
" diplomats said @entity5 has agreed to a cap of fewer than 6,000 centrifuges that it can operate to enrich uranium , a process that can lead to weapons - grade material			1
the figure is down from the 6,000 the sides were speaking about when the talks started on thursday , but substantially more than the several hundred the @entity28 had originally wanted			0
@entity5 currently runs about 10,000 centrifuges , but it has around 19,000 in its stockpile			2
@entity28 officials maintain the number is abstract , because there will be other restrictions on the levels of enrichment and type of centrifuges @entity5 can operate , which they believe will extend the time @entity5 would need to have enough fissile material produce a nuclear weapon -- known as the " break - out time " -- to at least a year			1
on monday , a senior @entity160 official said negotiators had not yet decided anything about the disposal of fissile material			0
there had been word previously that @entity5 might export it to @entity26 , but an @entity5 negotiator , @entity166 , told journalists sunday that @entity5 had not agreed to it			2
" the export of stocks of enriched uranium is not in our program , and we do not intend to them abroad			0
... there is no question of sending the stocks abroad , " he said			0
@entity12 voiced alarm at the emerging deal			1
after meeting with visiting senate majority leader @entity181 , a @entity182 , @entity12 said , " this agreement as it evolves is fulfilling our deepest fears and even worse			2
" " in parallel to the gathering for this dangerous agreement , the proxies of @entity5 in the @entity187 are carrying out a wide occupation of @entity192 , " he said			2
" the @entity5 - @entity1 - @entity192 axis is very dangerous to mankind and needs to be stopped			2
" the parties are seeking agreement on the basic parameters of a deal before march 31			0
a comprehensive deal including technical annexes is supposed to be concluded by june 30			0
tuesday is seen as a critical milestone to the @entity28 negotiators , who are trying to thwart a threat from @entity203 to impose additional sanctions without the framework			0
that could prompt @entity5 to withdraw from the talks and scuttle the chances of a deal altogether			1
but even if a pact is reached , it is unclear what form it would take			0
@entity28 officials say they will need to publicize something that quantifies @entity5 's commitments before submitting it to @entity203			2
but @entity28 and @entity30 diplomats say that @entity5 is looking simply for an " understanding " of what has been agreed to before a formal accord is reached			2
@entity3 's @entity220 contributed to this report .			0

one key sticking point : what would be the limits on @entity5 nuclear research ?
another sticking point : when would @entity45 sanctions be lifted ?
@entity13 prime minister @entity12 warns the deal would be a *disaster*
