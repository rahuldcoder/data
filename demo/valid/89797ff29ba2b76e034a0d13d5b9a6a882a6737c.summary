@entity0 go to the polls on march 28 in a tight contest , which is getting extra attention after the original date was rescheduled at the last minute			1
many voters will be holding their registration card in one hand , and their mobile in the other -- making democratic history with the help of tech. in @entity18 's largest mobile phone market , programs to encourage citizens to get involved in the election have been gaining traction			1
" @entity0 are looking for information , " says @entity20 , co-founder of @entity21 which meshes tech and social issues			1
" technology is helping people get involved in the conversation around democracy and elections , which is very important , as the general interest in the air has waned since the voting date was changed			0
" as incumbent @entity33 prepares to face - off against former military ruler @entity34 , @entity20 and his team have developed @entity36 -- a gang of geeks who work on web - projects that help citizens vote			1
@entity41 one such project is @entity43 , a popular website that is focused on the registration process -- that 's crucial as in @entity18 's most populous country , with over 170 million citizens , the logistics can be staggering			1
" most @entity0 have no idea where they are registered , " explains @entity20			1
" we want to simplify the entire election process , [ and ] make it responsive to users			1
" people log on to the site to see whether they are registered with the @entity0 @entity57 ( @entity57 ) and , if not , they can find out how and where to register			1
@entity59 says approximately 10,000 people visit the site each day			0
@entity63 's influence other squads concentrate on the next step			2
youth charity @entity66 has set up @entity67 which gets @entity0 to " use your thumb wisely			1
" sections like " who can vote " and " where and when " set out the process in language anyone can understand			0
interactive maps connect users to local activists and the countdown clock is a reminder that the new elections date is approaching fast			0
" the rescheduling of the election ... did affect the level of voter enthusiasm , " explains @entity80 , @entity81			2
" while there are certain concerns about security and the guarantee of free , fair and credible elections , the interest in this election is founded on the belief that this time votes will count			2
" personality problem this election will be the first since @entity0 re-calculated it 's gdp and pulled ahead of @entity18 to become the continent 's biggest economy			1
with a nominal gdp of $ 510 billion , and an oil sector that makes up 96 % of total export earnings , the outcome of the vote will be closely watched by policy makers and businesses all over the world			0
politicians , however , stand accused of relying on personalities rather than policies when it comes to winning votes			0
" the strength of a leader 's personality and his key personal networks are playing a very strong role , " says @entity113 , @entity0 director at @entity114			1
" both flag - bearers occasionally attempt to articulate policy positions -- it is still a far cry from policy - based politics			2
" and this is set to be a particular issue in this poll , as some seek a strongman who can defeat @entity131 militants in the @entity132 -- the main justification authorities used when explaining the decision to delay the vote by six weeks			0
to fight this popularity contest , @entity59 collaborated with @entity137 ( @entity138 ) to produce ngmanifesto.org , which explains what the parties plan to do to improve education , the economy and infrastructure			0
and once a government is elected , the site will track whether election pledges become reality			2
' quick count ' technology will also play a big role on voting day			0
a representative volunteer network of 4,000 observers trained by @entity154 ( @entity154 ) will corroborate official election results using a system of text messages			2
the smss are coded so they can not be intercepted , and also to ensure the data can be organized and communicated quickly			0
the process aims to bring transparency to the elections , and will be assisted by @entity164 's former prime minister , @entity163 , who is part of a smaller team of international observers organized by the @entity114			2
such independent observation is likely to speak to the thousands of citizens concerned with governance in the country			0
a recent @entity173 poll found that 68 % of respondents are " not very " or " not at all " satisfied with the way democracy is working in @entity0			1
another approach to inspire citizens to get involved in the election is the @entity0 constitution app which has been downloaded almost 1 million times according to @entity182			1
by making the constitution available on mobile phones , the app aims to teach citizens about national laws and inspire them to vote			0
and there 's also @entity189 -- a site that publishes state and federal budgets for all to see			0
the list of election - based websites and apps goes on -- too many to mention here			1
but , while the election outcome is yet to be seen , it seems that the tech involved could bring a formidable force to the ballot box			0
