the white - haired woman 's face beams as the camera gets closer to her face			2
she 's sitting on a couch , with a @entity7 shirt draped behind her and a rap song playing in the background			1
suddenly , the words spew from her pink - painted lips : " ni * * * * , ni * * * * , ni * * * * , ni * * * * , ni * * * * , ni * * * * , ni * * * * * ! " the release of the @entity15 video , featuring the house mother of the campus ' @entity19 chapter , could n't come at a worse time -- just days after video surfaced of frat members singing a racist song			1
but @entity24 , the fraternity 's house mother , insists she 's not racist			1
and two black alumni of the fraternity house agree with the woman they call " @entity29 " " i have been made aware that a video of me that is circulating on social media and in the news , " @entity24 said in a statement			1
" i am heartbroken by the portrayal that i am in some way racist			1
i have friends of all race and do not tolerate any form of discrimination in my life			2
the song in the background was the sound of " @entity45 " from @entity46 -- a black , @entity49 - based rapper			1
" i was singing along to a @entity51 song , but completely understand how the video must appear in the context of the events that occurred this week			1
" @entity55 , the most recent black member at the fraternity chapter , said no one should use the n - word in any context -- even if it 's just a song			1
" that word needs to die , " @entity46 told @entity60			0
" with that being said , i do n't believe that @entity63 has hatred in her heart			0
i was there with her for four years			0
she took great care of me ... she cared about me , she cares about my family			0
she had pictures of me , my wife , my children on the entryway table in that house			2
@entity74 means a lot to me			1
" @entity46 said he has reached to @entity63 after the @entity77 newspaper posted the clip , which was shot in 2013			0
" i essentially said , ' hey , do n't ever use that word again , even in a song			2
but from me , you 're forgiven			0
' " black @entity83 alumnus : ' they are not my brothers ' @entity85 , the first @entity86 - @entity86 member of the campus ' @entity19 chapter , also defended " @entity63 " " i would n't even hesitate for a split second to say that @entity63 is undoubtedly not a racist , " @entity85 said			1
" i see her as being caught up in the moment			0
she does like to mix it up socially , and she likes to have fun with the guys and their dates they bring over to the house			2
and i see this as maybe her getting caught away with the moment			0
" @entity83 's @entity19 chapter unraveled this week after video showed frat brothers singing about excluding black students and alluding to lynching			1
" there will never be a ni * * * * @entity19 , " some chanted			0
" you can hang him from a tree , but he can never sign with me			0
there will never be a ni * * * * @entity19			0
" two students expelled over racist chant after the fraternity chapter was suspended -- but before her own video was publicized -- @entity24 told @entity2 affiliate @entity117 that she was blindsided by the controversy			1
" i feel like the rug has been pulled out from under me , " she said			0
" this has been my life for 15 years			0
" in the end , the @entity19 chapter was forced to close			2
two students have been expelled			0
and it 's not clear what the next chapter is for @entity63 opinion : are frats ' a form of @entity86 apartheid ' ? @entity2 's @entity132 contributed to this report .			1

@entity24 says she was singing along to a song but understands how the video must appear
