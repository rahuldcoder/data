a severe solar storm created a stunning display of light in the night sky over parts of the @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 early wednesday morning , spotted by those lucky enough to be awake in the wee hours			1
called aurora borealis in the @entity14 and aurora australis in the @entity16 , the lights were the product of large geomagnetic blasts from the sun that arrived tuesday about 10 a.m. et ( 1 a.m. wednesday in @entity20 )			2
both the aurora borealis and the aurora australis were sparked by a particularly strong solar storm that sent charged particles toward the @entity25 , said @entity1 meteorologist @entity26			1
" when these particles bombard the @entity25 's magnetic field in the upper atmosphere , the collision often creates brilliant colors , " @entity26 said			0
" most of the time , auroras appear green -- when these particles collide with oxygen in the atmosphere -- but there were reports this past aurora australis also appeared to have a reddish tint , which suggested the collision with high - altitude oxygen was also seen on @entity25			0
" share your photos of the aurora with @entity43 the stronger the storm , the farther south it can be seen , said @entity26			1
and this geomagnetic storm was rather powerful , reaching as a high as a @entity48 on a scale from 1 to 5 tuesday night , according to @entity51 's @entity50			2
the storm was expected to last 24 to 36 hours , and @entity51 's latest reports say it 's down to a @entity53			0
though the storm could affect gps technology and power grids , @entity51 said tuesday that it had no reports of disruptions			0
the most visible impact as been this stunning light display			1
if the auroras are seen again tonight , @entity26 said , they wo n't be as pronounced and most likely wo n't reach as far south as tuesday night			2
people in northern @entity63 , northern @entity64 and @entity65 may be able to spot them , although he warned that clouds from @entity64 to @entity67 may impede visibility wednesday night .			0
