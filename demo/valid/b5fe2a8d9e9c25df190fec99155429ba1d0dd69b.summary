might sound extreme , but breast cancer experts say she was spot on			1
" i understand what @entity1 did , and i would have done it , too , " said dr. @entity10 , the chief medical officer of the @entity11			2
@entity10 said if he were @entity1 's doctor he would have advised her to do what she did because her mother , aunt , and grandmother all had ovarian cancer , and her mother had breast cancer as well			1
plus , @entity1 has a gene that gives her about an 87 % chance of getting breast cancer sometime in her life			1
" she has one of the particularly bad breast cancer genes , " @entity10 said			1
the decision is made even easier by advances in breast reconstruction and by hormone treatments that help ease women into menopause , which is induced by removing the ovaries			1
the ovary surgery was a no - brainer , doctors say , and some wondered why she did n't do it sooner			0
in her op - ed , @entity1 explained that every year she 's had a blood test called @entity41 , to monitor for ovarian cancer			2
but that test often has false positives and false negatives , said dr. dr. @entity46 , director of the @entity47 at the @entity48			0
" you really ca n't rely on it , " she said			0
instead of screening , experts in cancer genetics recommend that women at a very high risk for ovarian cancer , like @entity1 , remove their ovaries as soon as they 're done having children			1
" i ca n't emphasize enough how important this is , " @entity46 said			0
@entity46 was glad to hear tuesday morning that @entity1 had decided to move forward			2
" what she 's done is really important to save her life , because there 's no way to detect ovarian cancer , " she said			2
@entity1 's decision about her breasts ( also documented in an op - ed ) , however , is not so clear cut , @entity46 explained , because it would have been perfectly acceptable if @entity1 had decided to keep her breasts and to get regular @entity69 instead			2
" we have lots of survivors who went that route , and they 've done well , " she said			0
some made the decision to keep their breasts because they could n't afford a good plastic surgeon for breast reconstruction , she added			0
" celebrities have access to that kind of surgery , but that 's not the life everyone lives , " @entity46 said			0
@entity10 added that @entity1 's decision likely would n't be right for someone with a different kind of breast cancer gene mutation			1
for example , some women have a mutation that gives them a 15 % chance of getting breast cancer in their lifetime			1
that 's not much higher than the 12 % chance a woman has of getting breast cancer even if she has no mutation at all			1
he says he worries that some of these women with just a slightly increased risk will hear about @entity1 's decision and want to remove their breasts , too			1
" to get surgery in their situation is really overkill , " he said			0
" most of these women would be just fine if they took tamoxifen for five years and got regular mammograms			0
" but all in all , doctors say they 're glad @entity1 has been so public with her decision making			2
" these very publicly shared medical sagas from respected figures play a very powerful role in creating these teachable moments , " said dr. @entity112 , chief of clinical genetics at @entity114			0
@entity2 's @entity119 also contributed .			0

@entity1 has a gene that gives her an 87 % chance of getting breast cancer
experts in cancer genetics recommend that women in a similar situation remove their ovaries as soon as they 're done having children
