was the @entity1 better off under dictatorships ? it is certainly tempting to think so when one looks at conflicts in the region today , from @entity6 to @entity7 to @entity8			1
those three countries have followed different trajectories since the start of the @entity12 in 2011 , but what they have in common now is instability that is not likely to be overcome in the short term			2
while this instability is making the @entity18 -- particularly the @entity19 -- uncomfortable , it is also a direct result of the @entity18 's own stance towards dictatorships in the region prior to and during the @entity12			1
the @entity18 's shortsightedness in handling the @entity1 throughout its modern history has directly contributed to its current devastation			1
before 2011 , what the @entity18 most valued in the @entity1 was stability rather than democracy			1
@entity31 dictatorships were tolerated for decades despite their cruelty because they served @entity34 economic , political , and security interests			2
in @entity36 , @entity35 was seen as the bulwark of peace with @entity39			0
in @entity7 , a reformed @entity40 was courted for potential investment and trade agreements			0
in @entity8 , @entity43 was a predictable leader who maintained the @entity44 as a conflict - free zone			0
in @entity6 , @entity46 was regarded as an ally against @entity48			0
dictatorships kept the status quo manageable			2
government suppression of activism and of the alternative voices of civil society and independent media meant that top - down decisions were rarely contested			0
this pretty much guaranteed that @entity34 interests would be served without too many complications			0
in return , @entity31 dictators enjoyed @entity34 financial and military aid and political reassurances			2
@entity6 was the epitome of this dynamic			0
@entity46 courted and was courted by @entity19 diplomats who turned a blind eye to his transgressions , from arms smuggling to forcing new businesses to include him as a " partner " so that he could ensure a cut in the profits , while most @entity6 lived below the bread line			0
read more : how we got here in @entity6 @entity46 's value was in engaging in the " war on terror " through allowing @entity19 drones to strike @entity83			2
the fact that he used this engagement as an excuse to ask for military assistance for @entity6 -- which in reality was used to equip what would become a private army -- was considered a small price to pay by the @entity19			0
when the reality of living under dictatorships became exposed with the @entity12 , the @entity18 could no longer ignore it and had to publicly declare support for the uprisings			1
but the @entity18 did not have a long - term strategy for handling the aftermath of dictatorships -- and the results have been catastrophic			1
@entity7 saw hasty international military intervention without a vision for stabilizing the country , and today is falling apart			0
@entity8 saw diplomatic toing and froing that eventually dragged the @entity18 into a messy war			1
@entity6 was for a while thought of as an acceptable compromise because of the @entity111 's initiative that ended the uprising through a negotiated transition from @entity46 to his deputy @entity114			2
but the long - term implications for this transition were ignored and @entity6 today is paying the price			0
@entity6 summarizes all the ills of dictatorships and their handling by foreign patrons			2
the @entity18 was naïve to think that @entity46 would simply accept his removal from power			1
in an ironic turn of events , he has found in the @entity126 rebels -- who had been marginalized under his rule and became even more so under @entity114 -- an unlikely ally to regain influence			0
@entity130 was also naïve in thinking that @entity126 rule in northern @entity6 would be better than having a political presence for the @entity133 -- the @entity134 's staunchest political foe -- in @entity135			2
the @entity130 and the @entity18 ignored the simmering sectarian tensions between the @entity137 and the @entity139 tribes of @entity6 , not to mention the popular anger at @entity19 - led drone attacks that sometimes killed civilians			1
they also ignored @entity145 's rising ambitions ; why would the @entity137 -- @entity145 's allies -- limit themselves to northern @entity6 if they could also expand southwards and rule the whole country ? the situation in @entity6 today shows that even though the status quo under dictatorships may have appeared stable , beneath the surface volcanoes were preparing to erupt			1
dictators may keep a country secure , but they do that at the expense of their own people			0
they may support the @entity18 's interests , but they will turn against them whenever their own interests are threatened			1
although many today lament that the @entity12 has turned into an @entity31 winter , the conflicts emerging across the @entity1 are largely the result of the political , economic , and social ills of dictatorships and the conditions that had sustained them			1
they have come to the surface because the lid has been lifted			0
but the current misery in the @entity1 still does not mean that the region was better off under dictatorships			1
the aftermath of dictatorships is always messy , and democratic transition is never linear			1
those with nostalgia for the days of @entity31 strongmen should remember that autocratic regimes plant the seed of future unrest and therefore only offer false , temporary security -- even if " temporary " takes a few decades to pass .			0

@entity185 : @entity18 supported @entity1 dictators until it became *unpalatable* in 2011
@entity185 : @entity18 's lack of a plan for aftermath of dictatorships has been catastrophic
