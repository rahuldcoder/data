@entity1 the @entity0 is reviewing @entity4 's emails to determine what can be released to the public , not whether she did anything wrong , according to a senior department official			0
@entity10 aides and department officials stressed this week that the former secretary of state did not violate @entity0 policy when she exclusively used a private email account for government work			1
however , it is currently unclear whether @entity10 broke a state guideline dating back to 2005 that suggested " normal day - to - day operations be conducted on an ( authorized information system ) , which has the proper level of security control			2
" those guidelines were filled with exemptions that could allow @entity10 to use a private account			1
the department official was careful to say that the people reviewing the documents are " not going to prejudge the outcome of the review of secretary @entity10 's 55,000 pages of emails			1
" @entity10 was not automatically in violation of @entity0 policy when she exclusively used a private email during her four years as @entity38 's top diplomat , the source added , contradicting other media on thursday			1
" under federal regulations , there is no prohibition on using a personal email for official business as long as any records are preserved , " the official said			2
" reports claiming that by using personal email she is automatically in violation of that @entity51 [ @entity53 manual ] are inaccurate			0
" @entity10 's use of private email was never hidden from anyone , according to a former @entity0 official			1
the former secretary of state sent thousands of employees message from that account and in her four plus years at the @entity0 , nobody raised a red flag and say that she could n't conduct her email communication in the manner she was conducting it , the former official adds			2
there were no big internal discussion among @entity0 lawyers , either , about @entity10 's use of private email			1
the former official said it was simply accepted as her form of communication			0
@entity10 's exclusive use of a private email system has quickly ballooned this week into a controversy for the presumed @entity77 frontrunner for president in 2016			1
experts have said it does n't appear @entity10 violated federal laws , but that has n't stemmed the issue that has become more about bad optics and politics			1
@entity10 tweeted on wednesday night that she asked @entity0 to release her emails			2
" i want the public to see my email , " her tweet said			0
" they said they will review them for release as soon as possible			0
" the @entity0 acknowledged @entity10 's request after the tweet , and a senior official said the review could " take several months			1
" and while @entity0 officials said their review will focus on what can be released , the inquiry will also have to determine what is not suitable for dissemination given its sensitivity			0
if the department has to withhold documents , questions are likely to be raised about whether @entity10 broke @entity0 guidance for transmuting sensitive but unclassified materials			2
on friday , @entity111 , a state department spokeswoman , said she was " not going to speculate " about whether there is sensitive information in @entity10 's emails			1
" we just do n't know what would happen in that situation , there are so many variables and factors , i just really do n't want to speculate , " @entity111 said			0
the @entity121 reported on thursday that @entity10 's closest aides at @entity0 were well aware that @entity10 communicated using a private email address			1
" neither career foreign service officers nor @entity0 lawyers suggested that mrs. @entity4 use a department email address , " the @entity121 reported , citing a person with direct knowledge of the inner workings of @entity0 under mrs. @entity4			0
@entity10 's spokesman failed to comment to @entity2 questions about those revelations by the @entity121			1
a senior @entity0 official did say on friday that administration officials who engaged in email exchanges with her would been party to the fact she used a private account , although it is unclear how many administration officials she actually emailed			2
several @entity10 former senior staffers have said they used to get their instructions from her verbally			0
the questions around @entity10 's email use have captivated political watchers over the last week and allowed @entity148 to cast @entity10 in a similar way they did her husband , former president @entity10 : as a secretive politician pushing the boundaries and rules and regulations			1
charges of hypocrisy have also surfaced given that an inspector general 's report from 2012 - while @entity10 was secretary - repeatedly cited ambassador to @entity163 @entity162 's use of " commercial email for official government business " saying it was against policy to do so " except in emergencies , " which created morale problems , " confusion and discouragement within the embassy community			1
" @entity162 , who resigned his post in 2012 before the @entity173 report became public , was criticized for a number of other things in the document , but it was clear that his using commercial email instead of @entity0 email was a real concern			0
at the time , @entity10 was using her own personal email account to conduct official business			2
@entity10 set up a server at her home in @entity186 to keep her emails , meaning she and her aides were in possession of the documents , not the @entity0			0
when the representatives from @entity0 asked for all her records in 2014 , @entity10 sent them the 55,000 pages of emails			0
a @entity10 aide said they provided " anything that pertained to her work " at @entity204 , but it is impossible to verify the former secretary of state did send everything			0
@entity0 guidelines require employees who use private email accounts to back up those documents on government computers so that the department can archive them and they can be available for @entity212 requests			1
@entity10 aides argue that they complied with @entity0 rules when they sent the documents to the department , but that did not happen until 2014 , over a year after @entity10 left the department			0
in addition to directives from @entity204 , federal guidelines from @entity10 's four years leading the department do not appear to outlaw the exclusive use of personal email devices			1
the @entity225 , the government agency that regulates the @entity226 , issued guidance in 2009 -- the same year @entity10 took over at @entity204 -- that allowed agency employees to use personal accounts as long as they ensured " that federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system			2
" before that , the archives agency said they did not " specifically address this issue			0
" it was n't until 2014 - when president @entity237 signed an update to the @entity239 - that a timeline was set up to mandate how quickly emails had to be turned over by people who used personal devices			0
@entity244 , @entity245 , @entity246 and @entity247 contributed to this report .			0
