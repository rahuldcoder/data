in the final days of the @entity2 election campaign , prime minister @entity0 disavowed the two - state solution and said there would be no @entity7 state on his watch			1
he also earned universal condemnation for his panicked warning to his followers on election day that @entity18 were " voting in droves " -- a comment that will resound to his shame and can neither be forgiven nor forgotten unless he apologizes clearly , sincerely and without reservation			0
and now , facing international uproar and a stern @entity22 response , @entity2 officials have started backing away from these statements			1
the @entity2 ambassador to @entity25 , @entity26 , said wednesday on @entity27 , " this is an election campaign and you have to take with a grain of salt what was said at the last minute when the polls say you are going to lose			1
" @entity0 himself , in an interview on @entity35 , tried to qualify his words about a two - state solution , saying what he meant to say was that a @entity7 state was not viable under present conditions			1
he knows that stance is totally unacceptable to @entity2 's chief ally , the @entity22 , and to the rest of the international community			2
and he should not be allowed to slip off the hook so easily			0
indeed , far from taking this statement with a grain of salt , the world is likely to look back at his previously stated support for a two - state solution and take that with more than a grain of salt			0
the fact is , rhetorical if not actual support for a two - state solution has served @entity0 well for the past several years , and has provided him with a convenient shield against international pressure to end the almost 48 - year occupation of the @entity60 and @entity61			1
also helping @entity0 was the presence in his cabinet of @entity2 politicians who actually do believe in a two - state solution and worked hard to make it happen -- notably former foreign minister @entity67 , who headed up the failed 2014 negotiations with the @entity7			1
@entity67 wanted to move forward in the talks , but found herself hemmed in and frustrated by @entity0 's aides -- and apparently by the prime minister himself -- at every turn			2
now , as he constructs a coalition of ultranationalists and @entity76 , those shields have been stripped away			0
@entity0 must now face the world having bared his true face and exposed his true beliefs -- and the international community , led by the @entity22 , must respond accordingly			2
what should this involve ? to begin with , @entity82 should not wait for others to draft a @entity85 resolution condemning the settlements			0
it should take the initiative , in consultation with its international partners , in drafting a resolution that lays out the detailed parameters for an end to the @entity2 - @entity7 conflict			1
the resolution should of course state unequivocally that the solution rests in an @entity2 withdrawal to the 1967 lines , with equivalent land swaps to incorporate some of the major settlement blocs within @entity2			1
it should also reiterate @entity2 's right to security			2
and it should state clearly and unambiguously that the settlements are illegal under international law and must stop			0
words are important -- but more important are deeds			0
whatever he says about the two - state solution , the next @entity0 government is virtually certain to blast ahead with settlement - building			2
it is on that basis that he and his administration should be diplomatically isolated and condemned			0
in his campaign statement , @entity0 took pride in approving the construction of a huge suburb on the southern fringes of @entity119 in order to block @entity7 construction from neighboring @entity122			1
he boasted that the building was not simply to provide housing for @entity125 rather than @entity7 , but that it was to make it harder for the @entity7 to establish a coherent , territorially contiguous state			2
@entity0 's statement was a moment of truth for him , for @entity2 and for the world			1
he was admirably blunt and concise			0
he left no doubt what he intended			0
now , the world must hold him to account .			0
