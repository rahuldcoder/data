on tuesday , a @entity5 federal jury delivered its own message to artists everywhere that inspiration can rise to copyright infringement			2
the verdict was reached after eight days of trial testimony examining whether @entity12 's and @entity14 ' " @entity13 , " one of the most successful songs of the young century , was improperly drawn from a soulful hallmark from the prior one — @entity18 's 1977 hit " @entity19			1
" ultimately , a jury comprised of five women and three men heard dueling opinions regarding " @entity13 " and decided to order @entity12 and @entity14 to pay $ 4 million in copyright damages plus profits attributable to infringement , which for @entity12 was determined to be $ 1.8 million and for @entity14 was determined to be $ 1.6 million			1
both escaped statutory damages as the infringement was found not to be willful			0

most never get past the summary judgment phase because judges carefully draw the line on any lawsuits alleging misappropriation of non-protectable ideas			0
the highest profile disputes like the one between @entity46 and @entity47 over " @entity48 " usually settle			0
not only did the " @entity13 " case go the distance , both sides brought esteemed entertainment litigators to convince the jury			1
@entity54 , representing @entity12 , @entity14 and rapper @entity55 ( a.k.a. @entity55 ) , spoke how artists need wide berth in their creative pursuits			0
during opening arguments , he told the jury , " we 're going to show you what you already know : that no one owns a genre or a style or a groove			2
to be inspired by @entity18 is an honorable thing			2
" over the next week - and - a - half , @entity54 would execute a two - pronged strategy : first , he emphasized that @entity71 and @entity72 only owned compositional elements in the " @entity19 " sheet music , leaving out more recognizable elements of the recording like the percussion and singing			1
second , he had witnesses testifying both to the differences of " @entity13 " and " @entity19 " as well as the similarities in other famous songs			1
the case has been tough on @entity12 thanks to depositions revealing he lied in media interviews and was drunk and high on @entity86			0
but the singer attempted to do himself a favor by showcasing that songs can be stitched together with ease and that perceptions about similarity can be deceiving			0
on the witness stand , he sang a medley of @entity96 's " with @entity97 , " @entity98 ' " @entity95 , " @entity100 's " @entity99 , " @entity102 's " @entity101 " and @entity104 's " @entity103			2
" read more : @entity12 admits drug abuse , lying to media in wild " @entity13 " deposition ( exclusive ) @entity14 also testified about his song creation process , admitting to jurors that " @entity13 " channels " that ' 70s feeling " and that he looked up to @entity72 , but that to feel , is n't copyright infringement			1
" the last thing you want to do as a creator is take something of someone else 's when you love him , " said @entity14 , expressing a point - of - view that 's in contrast to the maxim that good artists borrow and great artists steal			2
@entity124 , attorney for the @entity125 , appeared to know he 'd need to overcome the celebrity charisma of his counterparts			0
" they will smile at you and they will be charming , " he said in opening arguments			0
" keep one thing in mind : they are professional performers			0
" read more : ' @entity13 ' trial -- @entity12 performs piano medley in court the @entity72 family was handicapped by @entity141 district judge @entity140 's decision to preclude use at trial of the original sound recording of " @entity19 " because @entity72 's copyrights on the song were limited to the sheet music compositions			1
before the trial began , @entity124 wondered whether his side would get a fair trial , and while the judge eventually allowed a stripped - down version of @entity72 's song to be played for the jury 's ears , the attorney was disturbed by comments made by the @entity12 side that he argued had " poisoned " the trial			1
the judge dismissed those concerns			0
any lingering unhappiness over the judge 's decision leading to the jury 's verdict will likely be taken on appeal			1
to demonstrate copyright infringement , @entity124 instead leaned on the musicologists , who testified of similarities in signature phrase , hook , keyboard - bass interplay , lyrics and theme of the songs			2
although " @entity13 " was the headliner , the @entity72 family also attempted to prove that @entity12 's " @entity180 " was an infringement of @entity72 's " @entity179 " too			1
then , there was the rare peek at " @entity13 " financial success as the @entity72 family made their case for damages			1
@entity124 had accounting experts speak about all the money made — including $ 5.6 million in profits to @entity12 , $ 5.2 million to @entity14 and $ 700k to @entity55 and the rest of the $ 16.7 million in overall profits to record companies @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194			2
the @entity195 also wanted some of the $ 11 million in touring income attributable to " @entity13 " success as well as money for overhead costs and statutory damages for willful infringement			1
all told , the @entity72 family was seeking more than $ 25 million — a mammoth demand that would shatter the song plagiarism high - water mark of $ 5.4 million that a @entity5 court ordered @entity207 and @entity208 to pay two decades ago for infringing the @entity210 ' " @entity209			1
" in closing arguments , @entity124 raised the issue of @entity12 's credibility , telling jurors , " " what it boils down to is ' yes , we copied			2
yes , we took it			0
yes , we lied about it			0
yes , we changed our story every time ' ... it boils down to this : who do you believe ? ... are you going to believe @entity12 , who told us all he 's not an honest person ? " @entity54 offered a rebuttal			0
" why would mr. @entity14 need to copy anyone to create a hit ? " he asked the jury			0
" why would mr. @entity12 and mr. @entity14 endure a proceeding like this , where their personal financial details are revealed to the world ? " in what might now be the landmark legal controversy over songcraft , the jury decided to find that @entity12 and @entity14 infringed both songs			0
the two were only punished $ 9,375 for " @entity180 , " but it will be the multimillion dollar verdict regarding " @entity13 " that will sound out for ages			1
