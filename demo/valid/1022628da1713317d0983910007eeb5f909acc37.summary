waiting for @entity2 to arrive at @entity3 , there was a whole @entity5 aspect to it all			1
many @entity8 analysts believe @entity2 sees his speech to @entity11 warning of the dangers of a nuclear @entity13 akin to that of the late @entity17 prime minister 's famous address to parliament in 1939 warning of the pending danger of @entity21			1
indeed on the tarmac , @entity2 , with his wife , @entity24 , at his side , somberly declared his visit to @entity26 a " crucial " and " historic " trip and himself the " messenger " of all the @entity8 people , even those who do n't agree with him			1
" i fear for the fate of the @entity8 and therefore i will do everything i can to ensure the security of our future , " he told reporters before boarding			0
6 questions about @entity2 's trip in the days leading up to the trip , @entity2 laid the symbolism for embarking on what aides believe he views as his date with destiny , starting with a visit to the grave of his father , who he often says warned him about the dangers of missing threats to the @entity51 people before it is too late			1
on the eve of his trip , he vistied the @entity55 , the holiest site of @entity56			2
there @entity2 declared his solemn obligation to protect @entity8 , saying " we must unite " against the nuclear deal shaping up with @entity13 " that could endanger our very existence			1
" on board the @entity63 767 to @entity26 , @entity62 holed himself up with aides working on his speech			1
a pilot told us he heard the prime minister several times yelling from the cabin , " no , no -- stronger , stronger			0
" i sat in the back cabin with about 50 journalists -- print reporters , tv correspondents and crews and photographers			0
i 'm told that 's about double the number of press who normally travel with him			0
@entity84 and @entity2 : a clash of world views with 12 hours to kill , the journalists chatted about @entity2 , the visit and how his planned address to @entity11 has morphed into an international showdown of mythic proportions			2
we even found the movies on the plane steeped in symbolism : " @entity97 " -- an @entity99 - winning story about how a lone genius mathematician defeated all odds to crack @entity21 codes and help save @entity103 from @entity105 's grasp			0
then there was " @entity107 : @entity108 , @entity109 1 " a tale of a group of oppressed people led by a brave revolutionary who hopes good will triumph over evil			0
okay , maybe that " s a stretch			0
i did say it was a very long flight			0
@entity2 , as he is called , never came back			1
officials traveling with him said it was because he was busy with the speech			2
i never thought i would come to appreciate the access the @entity127 diplomatic press corps gets aboard the secretary of state 's plane			0
a senior official did come back to brief the reporters just before landing , telling us the prime minister would be laying out the details he understands to be part of the nuclear deal shaping up with @entity13 and urge @entity11 to press the @entity84 administration to push back the march 24 deadline for a political framework			1
@entity2 , the official said , saw the speech as a " last chance " to avert a bad deal with @entity13 , which could threaten @entity8 's future			1
we arrived at @entity145 to a snowy evening and took the motorcade to @entity26			2
@entity148 will tell if this was indeed a historic flight or a flight of fancy .			0
