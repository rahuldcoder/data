@entity0 no deal is better than a bad deal , say critics of president @entity6 's nuclear talks with @entity7			1
but what if @entity9 and @entity10 opponents succeed in their intensifying effort to derail the diplomacy ? the price of failure could be an ugly blame game and cascade of political reprisals leading to nuclear chicken between @entity7 and the @entity20 -- potentially leading to war			1
" we would have to deal with a resumption of @entity7 's nuclear activities , which we do n't want to see take place			1
@entity7 would have to deal with the resumption of sanctions , which they do n't want , " said @entity26 , a top nonproliferation official during @entity6 's first term			1
for now , the grave consequences of a breakdown in talks are one reason the @entity35 and @entity7 are still at the table , as a grueling diplomatic process reaches critical deadlines and painful political decisions beckon			1
@entity7 deal : a treaty or not a treaty , that is the question secretary of state @entity43 and @entity7 foreign minister @entity44 are haggling over the remaining issues in @entity46 , @entity47 , ahead of an end - of - the - month deadline for a framework agreement , which then must be finalized by july 1			1
but time may be running out for a deal in which six world powers would lift sanctions that have throttled @entity7 's economy in return for assurances that @entity57 will continue to stay a year or so away from developing a nuclear bomb			1
the @entity59 puts the chances of a deal at only 50 - 50 : disputes still rage over the scale of nuclear infrastructure @entity7 will be allowed to keep , the pace of sanctions relief and the extent of nuclear site inspections			1
despite the controversy stoked last week in @entity0 when 47 @entity9 senators sent a letter to @entity7 's leaders warning that the future of a deal was not guaranteed , many analysts believe that the talks will go on , even if the end - of - march deadline slips			1
" not because all sides are desperate to keep talking			0
but i think sufficient momentum has been created in the last month or so that they see real possibilities , " said @entity79 , a former senior @entity81 arms control official			0
@entity6 may now have slightly more political leeway on the talks than before -- ironically because of attempts by @entity35 and @entity89 critics to pen him in			2
a few weeks ago , skeptical @entity10 appeared to be lining up with @entity9 and approaching a veto - proof @entity93 majority that could have forced @entity6 to submit a deal to @entity95 or accept the passage of new sanctions			0
either move could have killed the agreement			0
but the @entity9 ' letter and a fiercely critical speech to @entity95 by @entity89 prime minister @entity102 on the proposed deal prompted some skeptical @entity10 to close ranks , at least temporarily			0
but @entity93 @entity105 majority leader @entity105 told @entity1 's @entity106 on " @entity107 " that @entity6 was on the cusp of agreeing a " very bad " deal that would allow @entity7 to keep its nuclear infrastructure intact			1
he said that if an agreement is reached , he would bring up legislation that would give @entity95 60 days to back or reject a deal , despite fresh pleas from the @entity59 for the @entity9 to hold off			0
if no deal is reached , @entity115 said on sunday that he would press ahead with toughening sanctions on @entity7 , he said			1
@entity9 sources , meanwhile , said that despite the furor over the letter from the senators , no @entity10 had yet formally pulled support for legislation requiring the @entity93 to have a say on the deal			0
that leaves the real possibility of a pitched political showdown on @entity7 in the coming months			1
the opening for diplomacy is meanwhile not endless			0
and if no deal emerges by july , political pressure for a tougher administration stance towards @entity7 may be unstoppable			1
if diplomacy fails , how events unfold will be dictated by how the process collapses ; who gets the blame ; and the political pressures exerted on @entity6 and @entity7 president @entity139 in @entity0 and @entity57			1
" if , at the end of june , there is not a deal , and talks have broken off , i think that it is inevitable that the @entity95 will adopt new sanctions legislation , " said @entity79 , now with the @entity140			0
" what that will mean is the @entity7 will reciprocate			1
" @entity7 could start up centrifuges halted during the nuclear negotiations , bring more advanced machinery online and enrich uranium to the potent 20 % level that would get it closer to a weapon			1
and if it bars international inspectors , the world would have no idea how far @entity7 is from making a bomb			1
what 's in the @entity7 nuclear deal the administration thinks that if the @entity35 gets the blame for using hardball tactics that derail talks -- if , say , @entity95 imposes more sanctions , as administration critics want -- there is no way its international partners would keep existing sanctions in place , let alone double down and impose new ones			1
in addition to unilateral @entity35 sanctions @entity95 has imposed , the @entity176 , @entity177 and other countries have put in place their own sanctions cutting off @entity7 from international partners and not just the @entity35 economy			1
@entity183 , a @entity184 security specialist at the @entity185 , predicted @entity7 would reap a propaganda victory			2
" it would give ammunition for @entity7 to say the @entity35 is not reliable , " he said			2
@entity189 's @entity188 , a specialist on the talks , said the @entity7 government would have little choice but to hit back at a tougher @entity35 stance			2
" the @entity7 are just not going to take it			2
they are going to feel condemned to respond			0
both sides will take their shovels and dig the holes deeper			0
" @entity197 continued , " we would be between a lame duck ( @entity35 ) president for whom negotiations had just failed , a weakened @entity139 , for whom negotiations have just failed , and a coming @entity35 presidential election -- not exactly the best environment to return to talks and accomplish a diplomatic settlement			1
" aborted negotiations that leave @entity7 rededicated to its nuclear program raise the specter of @entity57 with a bomb -- or some enemy country taking military action to stop it			1
did 47 @entity9 senators break the law in plain sight ? but critics of the deal being worked out in @entity47 do n't agree that such an outcome is the likeliest scenario			0
@entity9 hawks and @entity89 believe @entity57 is so desperate for sanctions relief , especially at a time of low oil prices , that it will have no choice but to offer a better deal than the one currently on the table and agree to the complete halt to uranium enrichment that @entity89 and conservatives demand			0
" if @entity7 threatens to walk away from the table -- and this often happens in a @entity233 bazaar -- call their bluff			2
they 'll be back , because they need the deal a lot more than you do , " @entity102 maintained in his @entity95 speech			0
former @entity9 presidential nominee @entity241 made the case in a @entity243 op - ed friday that @entity6 should " walk away from a flimsy nuclear agreement			0
" those opposed to the deal reject the administration that follow their advice would likely blow up the talks and set @entity0 on an inevitable path to war as the only remaining way to disable @entity7 's nuclear infrastructure			2
instead , @entity9 congressmen counter that several bills they are pushing , with significant @entity10 support , do not forestall the possibility of continued diplomacy if talks fail			0
they say that extra sanctions would increase @entity6 's leverage in diplomacy , not weaken it			0
even if talks do succeed this year , the long - term future of an agreement still would n't be assured			0
the diplomatic effort has powerful critics among hardliners in @entity57 who , whatever 's written on paper , could push to illicitly expand @entity7 's nuclear program and close in on a bomb			1
it 's not just republicans who fear @entity57 may violate any deal or test the limits of compliance			0
some people who back the talks admit that may be the case , too			0
in @entity0 , @entity95 will be required to lift the existing sanctions on @entity7 to sustain the agreement in years to come -- a step that is hardly a given			2
and the stiff @entity9 opposition means a deal is not assured of surviving the arrival of a new president in the @entity59 come 2017			2
a future @entity9 president could reverse @entity6 's sanctions waivers fairly quickly , as the senators warned in their letter to @entity7			1
whether the new president would want to do so is another matter , however , especially if @entity7 lives up to the terms of a deal , which would include stringent verification by international inspectors			1
he or she would risk a heavy political price			2
a unilateral @entity0 pullout would likely infuriate @entity35 partners and leave the rookie president facing a boiling crisis that could overwhelm the new administration 's nascent foreign policy			2
" that 's what the administration is counting on -- if there is compliance and the deal is working well , " said @entity79			0
@entity43 reminded @entity95 this week that @entity314 , @entity315 , @entity316 , @entity317 and @entity318 would all be cosignatories of a deal			0
" if all those countries have said this is good and it 's working , ( will a new president ) just turn around and nullify it on behalf of the @entity35 ? " he asked			2
" that 's not going to happen			0
" @entity95 would face the same cost - benefit calculation when it comes to the sanctions only lawmakers can expunge			0
in the event of a @entity10 @entity59 victory in 2016 , the congressional math could also change in favor of a deal			0
and if @entity9 keep their majorities , lawmakers who are bent on thwarting @entity6 may be less willing to handcuff a new @entity9 president .			2

@entity7 negotiations have large diplomatic and political *implications*
@entity342 could affect next president
