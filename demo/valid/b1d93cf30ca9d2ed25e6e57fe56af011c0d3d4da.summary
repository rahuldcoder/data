@entity0 has @entity2 and the world @entity3 firmly in his sights after winning the @entity6 on sunday			1
@entity0 won a three - way play - off with a 28 - foot birdie on the third extra hole to become only the fourth player since 1940 to win twice on the @entity11 before turning 22			1
it is a feat that not even @entity2 mastered with @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 the only players to have achieved that particular accolade in the past 75 years			2
but it is the @entity18 that is within @entity0 's focus heading towards @entity20			2
" i like studying the game , being a historian of the game , " @entity0 told the @entity11 website			1
" it 's really cool to have my name go alongside those			0
" but right now currently what i 'm really focused on is @entity2 and the @entity29 in the world			1
that 's who everyone is trying to chase			0
" that 's our ultimate goal to eventually be the best in the world and this is a great , great stepping stone			2
but going into the four majors of the year , to have closed one out in this kind of fashion is going to give me a lot of confidence			0
" @entity0 has long been heralded as the next big thing in golf -- shining in the amateur ranks with two @entity48 junior titles and leading last year 's masters after the third round before eventually finishing tied for second , three shots behind @entity52			1
on sunday , he held his nerve at the @entity54 in @entity55 , @entity56 , to hold on for the victory			0
he first rescued par on the 16th with a 60 - foot bunker shot and needed a 32 - foot putt to ensure his place in the playoff , which he duly holed			0
it was a putt of similar length that ensured a second tour win to add to his @entity68 success in july 2013 , which he also won courtesy of a playoff making him the youngest @entity11 winner for 82 years at the time .			0

@entity0 only the fourth player since 1940 to seal two @entity11 wins under age of 22
golfing 's newest star sets his sights on *usurping* @entity2 as the world 's @entity29
confidence is high going into the masters , in which he finished second a year *ago*
