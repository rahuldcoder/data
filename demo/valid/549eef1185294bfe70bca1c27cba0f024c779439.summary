in tennis , a hitting partner is someone who often does more than just practice with a big star			1
they sometimes have to be psychologists , waiters , chauffeurs and even bodyguards			0
they may get to travel the world but the job is n't without its perils			0
two years ago , for example , the father of @entity14 , one of the most hyped players in the last decade , was found guilty of assaulting the player 's former hitting partner , @entity17			1
now , one of the longest lasting relationships -- and one of the highest profile -- has come to an end			0
@entity24 , a constant in @entity26 ' life the past eight years , suggested on @entity27 earlier this week that he was no longer working with the 19 - time grand slam winner and has instead begun a partnership with @entity26 ' friend and tennis rival , @entity32			1
their split was confirmed by @entity26 ' agent , @entity35 , in an email to @entity2 , and @entity32 's coach , @entity37 , confirmed that @entity38 is indeed the two - time grand slam champion 's new hitting partner			1
they practiced together for the first time this week			0
" i 'm very excited about having @entity24 in the team , " @entity37 told @entity2 in an email			1
" @entity24 is a great guy ... and has so much experience in working with @entity26			1
" i saw @entity24 hit many times so i know he is just a very good tennis player			2
to give the player the best rhythm is extremely important			0
" on the other hand i think it 's very good there is someone else in the team with experience winning grand slams			2
that 's always very important			0
@entity24 knows what it is like to be in semifinals and finals in grand slams			2
" no one has disclosed what led to the parting of ways but @entity24 was n't with @entity26 as she won the @entity66 in january			1
@entity24 said he was injured , with @entity68 @entity67 replacing him			2
@entity37 , who was formerly alongside @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 when they either won or reached grand slam finals , said he was " very surprised " that @entity24 became available			1
" @entity24 was working so many years with @entity26 and i felt they had an excellent relationship , more than just player and hitting partner , " he said			1
" i felt they were very good friends			0
" but it 's not my business to know what went wrong			0
maybe they both needed a new challenge			0
i think everybody will remember the many years they worked together and the excellent results she had during that time			2
" @entity26 , about to make her return to @entity88 after a 14 - year absence , once likened @entity24 to a brother			1
" outside of my parents , i think he 's probably the most important person on the team , " @entity26 told @entity91 in 2013			1
" he 's much more than a hitting partner			1
he 's my older brother			0
" @entity24 's alliance with @entity32 serves as another change for the @entity98			1
azarenka split with coach @entity100 -- who quickly moved on to @entity101 -- and hired @entity37 in his place in february			2
@entity32 is attempting to recapture top form after foot and knee injuries derailed her in 2014			2
" from the first meeting , i felt a good connection ( with @entity32 ) and after the first two weeks i feel a very good connection , " said @entity37			1
" @entity109 is very motivated to get back to the top and wants to become a better player			0
that is what i feel on court and i believe it can be a great year for her			0
" i believe it 's also great for women 's tennis that @entity109 is back			0
she is a great tennis player and an excellent entertainer			0

@entity26 is no longer working with hitting partner @entity24
@entity24 , who worked with @entity26 for eight years , is now with @entity32
@entity24 *skipped* this year 's @entity66 as @entity26 won major *no.* 19
@entity32 's coach , @entity37 , is *thrilled* to have @entity24 in her team
