have @entity1 and his fellow survivors finally found a place they can settle in for the long term ? that was the question left still unanswered at the end of sunday night 's season finale of " @entity8 , " and a finale record 15.8 million viewers tuned in to find out the answer			1
@entity1 was back in " @entity13 " mode , telling the residents of @entity15 that he knew what it took to survive and they should follow him			1
that led up to one of many moments where we gasped during the 90 - minute finale			1
here are five of the biggest gaspworthy moments : 1			2
@entity24 is back we 've literally been looking for him all season , and @entity1 's old friend @entity24 -- going all the way back to the first episode -- made a return appearance , wielding a stick he used to kick walker , and human , butt when necessary			1
and it was definitely necessary once he was captured by two men wearing @entity36 's on their heads , who , we would later learn , wanted to turn @entity24 into a walker in order to join a horde of walkers they controlled			2
@entity43 looks done for it was @entity43 who happened upon that horde , and he and @entity47 were soon surrounded and forced into a car , with little chance of escape -- that is , until @entity24 rescued them			0
we rarely believe what we hear when there are rumors that @entity43 might die , but that was a close one			0
@entity58 and her casserole @entity60 continues to steal scenes left and right lately , and her threatening of @entity62 while lending him a casserole may be one of the best scenes in the series ' history so far			0
@entity67 gets shot we seriously thought @entity67 was a goner after a vengeful @entity70 shot him , then left him for a large group of walkers to attack			0
somehow , @entity67 survived and attacked @entity73 , but stopped short of killing him			0
that 's our @entity67 , always doing the right thing when it comes down to it			0
@entity1 's memorable walker encounter just when you thought you 'd seen everything , @entity1 literally squeezed a walker 's neck then discharged a round causing the walker to spray out blood -- a walker he presented to the residents of @entity15 , in a bid to lead them toward survival			1
@entity1 was then rudely interrupted by @entity62 , who slashed @entity91 's throat in a fit of anger			1
at that point , @entity94 told @entity1 to off @entity62 , which he did			1
phew ! it was one of the most intense episodes of the already hyperintense series , and our group of survivors somehow made it through			2
fans on @entity105 were into it			0
" that was the most intense hour and a half of my entire life , " one tweeted .			0

" @entity8 " ended its fifth season with many *shocking* moments
*spoiler* : @entity1 and crew made it through the finale alive
