@entity1 law enforcement officers have arrested a 23 - year - old man suspected of hacking the @entity6 @entity5 and swiping data from a satellite - based system used by the military to communicate with people worldwide , @entity1 authorities said friday			1
this arrest was one of 56 made this week in 20 separate operations conducted by regional organized crime units , @entity16 officers and others			1
the others caught range from a family of suspected fraudsters and a 16 - year - old believed to be behind hundreds of cyberattacks , according to @entity1 's @entity24			1
yet the arrest that the agency highlighted most was the one that targeted the world 's most powerful last june 15			2
on that date , someone hacked into the @entity6 @entity5 's servers and got data related to its " @entity35 " system			2
this included contact information -- including their names , emails and phone numbers -- of about 800 people and info on approximately 34,400 devices , the @entity24 reports			0
none of the hacked material was considered confidential , nor did it apparently include " sensitive data " or anything that " compromises @entity6 national security interests , " the @entity1 agency said			1
still , the person responsible for the hack cryptically played it up big in a post to @entity55 , a website that allows for anonymous posts			2
alongside screenshots of the dashboard used to control the @entity5 database , the hacker wrote , " we smite the @entity63 , lizardsquad your time is near " in apparent reference to a notorious band of black - hat hackers			1
" we 're in your bases , we control your satellites , " the hacker adds			1
" the missiles shall rein ( sic ) upon they who claim alliance , watch your heads ... we 're one , we 're many , we lurk in the dark , we 're everywhere and anywhere			2
" the 23 - year - old suspected hacker was not identified by name , with the @entity1 @entity24 saying only that he was arrested wednesday morning in @entity82 , a @entity83 suburb in the @entity84			1
the @entity6 military has been targeted by hackers before			0
some of those actions have been blamed on @entity89 sympathizers , like the january temporary takeover of the @entity93 's @entity92 account and @entity95 page			0
and last year , @entity6 federal officials accused four men of hacking into computer networks of the @entity6 military and @entity100 and stealing more than $ 100 million worth of software , some it related to the video game " @entity104 : @entity105			0
" there 's no indication that the june hack had anything to do with @entity89 or involved the theft of anything of much monetary value			0
still , hacks from groups such as @entity115 and @entity116 can have a significant impact			0
@entity118 , special agent in charge with the @entity6 @entity120 ( @entity121 ) , said in the @entity1 government statement that " this arrest underscores @entity121 commitment and the joint ongoing efforts among international law enforcement to stop cyber criminals in their tracks			1
" " @entity121 special agents will use every tool at their disposal to pursue and bring to justice those who attack the @entity5 , " @entity118 said			0
@entity3 's @entity134 and @entity135 contributed to this report .			0

the 23 - year - old man was one of dozens arrested in similar operations around @entity1
after the hack , he *allegedly* wrote online , " we 're in your bases , we control your satellites "
