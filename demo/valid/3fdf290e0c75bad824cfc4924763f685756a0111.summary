@entity2 federal agents on tuesday raided more than three dozen " maternity hotels " in @entity4 where foreign women give birth , allegedly for the sole purpose of having a @entity9 - citizen baby , authorities said			1
the " maternity tourism " sites included apartment complexes in @entity2 , @entity14 and @entity16 counties where authorities believe the businesses housed the foreign nationals about to give birth , federal officials said			1
those targeted residences are believed to have catered largely to women from @entity22 , who paid $ 15,000 to $ 50,000 for lodging , transportation and food , according to a statement by @entity28			1
those fees do n't necessarily include medical care , authorities said			2
authorities are looking for evidence of bringing in and harboring of undocumented visitors ; conspiracy , fraud and misuse of visas and permits ; tax evasion and false tax returns ; and willful failure to file report of foreign bank and financial accounts , court papers said			2
" based on the results of the investigations to date , it appears the women pay cash for prenatal visits and the actual delivery , " @entity9 authorities said			1
" as part of the package , clients were promised they would receive @entity56 numbers and @entity9 passports for their infants , which the mothers would take with them when they left the @entity9 " some of the packages included recreational trips to @entity63 , shopping malls and even to a firing range , authorities said			2
" any women encountered at the search locations will be interviewed and those identified as potential material witnesses will be directed when and where to report for further questioning , " authorities said tuesday			1
investigators were n't expected tuesday to comment further on the outcome of the raids , said @entity28 spokeswoman @entity75			0
in all , authorities obtained warrants for 37 locations and ended up searching more than 50 sites , including consensual searches , @entity75 said			1
the purported tourism businesses promoted themselves on the @entity81 and through social media , authorities said			1
one firm in @entity84 , @entity4 , advertised in @entity22 and branded itself as " @entity85			1
" operators of that firm could n't be immediately reached for comment tuesday			0
@entity22 women have been flocking to the @entity9 to give birth , lured because the country grants @entity9 citizenship to anyone born on @entity9 soil , @entity89 reported last month			1
that @entity89 account was cited in an affidavit filed monday in a federal @entity4 court by @entity100 agent @entity99 , who asked a judge for a warrant to search @entity84 apartment buildings for large sums of cash and evidence of contraband and a crime			1
the judge granted the warrant			0
read one affidavit " perpetrators of visa fraud schemes typically charge $ 40,000 to $ 60,000 , which is a fee able to be paid by the wealthy in @entity22 , " @entity99 stated in court papers			1
in 2012 , about 10,000 @entity22 women gave birth in the @entity9 , more than double the 4,200 in 2008 , according to @entity22 state media			1
@entity99 alleged that the birthing houses " will generally advise foreign national clients to fly to tourism points of entry such as @entity123 or @entity124 and to avoid traveling directly to @entity125			2
this advice is due to heightened security by ( @entity129 ) officials at @entity125 based on the volume of fraudulent visas and false statements and entry documents that @entity136 officials have experienced over the last decade related to birth tourism			2
" one operator of the alleged maternity tourism schemes in @entity4 was providing bank statements claiming he had monthly gross receipts of $ 213,968.79 and an annual income of $ 1,283,812.74 , @entity99 said in court papers			1
those bank statements were provided by an @entity146 special agent , @entity99 said			0
many of the families want an @entity9 child because a foreign passport could be the family 's ticket out of @entity22 if they grow weary of pollution or food safety scares			1
president @entity156 's widespread anti-corruption campaign has given rich @entity22 yet another reason to be on edge			1
" if things become economically or politically uncertain in one 's country of origin , the children have a place to come to , " @entity159 , a law professor at the @entity160 , told @entity89 last month			0
the children can " then sponsor their parents when they turn 21 , " @entity159 said			0
the desire to leave @entity22 is especially pronounced among the wealthy			2
almost two - thirds of @entity22 with more than 10 million yuan ( $ 1.6 million ) in the bank have emigrated , or are planning to , according to a @entity173 report released last year			2
one advertisement for a @entity180 location " claims that the apartments are extremely suitable for expectant mothers and their accompanying families , " @entity99 said in court documents			0
" the apartment will allow expectant mothers to experience the @entity9 lifestyle during their stay			0
" in an interview with @entity89 in february , @entity186 , 27 , said she paid tens of thousands of dollars to give birth in @entity4			2
that interview occurred well before tuesday 's federal announcement of raids			0
" i started getting ready for the trip around the end of my first trimester , " he said			0
" i asked my friends who have given birth before in the @entity9 for a doctor recommendation ; then i found a place to stay in the area for a few months , and purchased my plane ticket			0
" he , who gave birth last year , said a @entity9 passport for her baby means access to better education opportunities			0
foreign status opens the door to exclusive international schools in @entity209 , where she lives with her husband , and the option for the child to study abroad for high school and college			0
there is one catch , though			0
getting a @entity9 passport for a baby means the child will eventually be responsible for @entity9 taxes			0
@entity3 's @entity221 in @entity222 contributed to this report .			0
