@entity3 forty years ago , one of the greatest boxing matches in history took place in an unlikely setting : the capital of the @entity8			1
@entity10 's epic win over great rival @entity11 in 1975 became known as the " @entity12			2
" four decades later , and a crowd is gathered at the same venue in this sweating , sprawling city -- known as the @entity16 -- for a very different contest : a basketball game between two of the country 's pro teams			1
and yet , the @entity16 can not seem to escape its boxing legacy			2
the most famous athlete on court today just happens to be a boxer			1
@entity26 is the coach , as well as one of the shortest players on the roster at just five foot , six inches ( 168cm ) tall , of team @entity31			1
but the @entity8 is best known around the world as one of the greatest boxers of his generation , the first fighter to win championship belts in eight different weight divisions			1
but despite his on - court distraction , he 's not finished in the ring			1
@entity26 is little more than two months away from the most highly anticipated battle of his career			2
on may 2 , he will finally go toe to toe with @entity44 welterweight boxing champion @entity43 in @entity45 -- the fight most boxing fans have wanted to see for years			1
but for today , he seems more concerned that @entity31 trails several points behind the @entity49			0
in the locker room , @entity26 , who only played for a few unremarkable minutes in the second quarter , gives a short half - time speech to fire up his players			1
he speaks mostly in @entity54 , the main language of the @entity8 , peppering his locker room speech with @entity58 expressions like " offense " and " man - to - man defense			1
" seemingly inspired , the team charges back on court shortly after			1
surprisingly , @entity26 says he gets more nervous on the basketball court than when he faces a barrage of punches in the ring			1
" my hands [ get ] cold ! " he says with a laugh , while rubbing both hands together in the air			0
" i believe in my heart that my second sport is basketball , " he says later , explaining that it is a vital part of his cross-training for boxing			1
but he adds that he 's choosing to spend fewer minutes playing in professional basketball games these days to avoid injuries ahead of the @entity43 showdown			1
" i can say [ this will be ] one of the most important fights in my career , " @entity26 says , during an exclusive interview with @entity4			1
we speak at his cavernous home in a wealthy , gated community in @entity3			1
he is dressed in shorts , flip - flops and a red @entity91 t - shirt with his photo on it accompanied by the slogan " spirit			1
" a diamond - crusted gold watch glitters on his wrist			2
several giant paintings bearing quotations from the @entity102 decorate the walls			0
the @entity43 fight " has been five years in the making , " he says			1
" and finally it 's happening			0
i think the fans deserve it			0
" in fact , if it was n't for a chance encounter at another basketball game , the @entity43 and @entity26 camps may never have agreed to a fight			1
last january , the two boxers happened to attend the same @entity118 game in @entity119			0
@entity26 says the meeting in @entity121 gave both sides " confidence to push " for the fight			2
in doing so , the 36 year old says he 's fulfilling the wishes of the two eldest of his five children			1
" my son and my daughter , they really wanted this fight to happen , " he tells us			2
" three years ago [ they said ] ' @entity132 , i want you to fight @entity43			1
i want you to fight @entity43			1
' i said , ' why ? it 's not my fault			0
he does n't want to fight			2
' and now finally now it finally happened			0
they really , really want to watch the fight			2
" of course , the battle in @entity45 will be much more than the fulfillment of the dreams of fans and @entity26 's children			2
there is serious money riding on this fight			2
it 's estimated that the may 2 bout will break all financial records in the history of professional boxing			0
the pacman is believed to be earning around $ 80 million for the fight , while @entity43 -- who is undefeated -- is expected to earn 20 % more			1
asked how the whopping paycheck makes him feel , @entity26 replies " i feel blessed and i owe a lot to the fans			0
first to @entity156 but also the fans because of their support			0
" the @entity8 ' most famous son has come a long way from a childhood mired in poverty and hunger			1
his rags - to - riches story explains part of the enormous appeal he enjoys in a country where a quarter of the population lives below the poverty line , according to the @entity171			2
" he is a receptacle of hope , " says @entity172 , a veteran columnist at the @entity8 @entity173			1
" everybody believes @entity26 should win			0
they are joyful because they see themselves in @entity26 , because @entity26 comes from deep , deep down in the soil , " @entity172 adds			0
as a boy @entity26 eked out a living selling donuts in the street , recalls his childhood friend and member of his corner , @entity188			0
the two were neighbors in @entity190 , a city on the southern island of @entity192			0
it was there that @entity26 was introduced to boxing			0
as a teenager , he earned extra money to feed his family by battling in underground boxing fights			0
" i remember when i started boxing , i earned two dollars , only two dollars , " @entity26 recalls			0
he says two of his friends died competing in these unofficial bouts			0
now a multi-millionaire and superstar , @entity26 says he and his wife are trying to teach their children to appreciate the life of comfort they now enjoy			2
to prove the point , he says he transferred his children from an academy for international students to a school with no air conditioning			2
" i want them to experience , so they can meet hungry families , " he says			0
" so they will not mistreat other people or treat other people different , " he adds , making a slapping gesture			0
when @entity26 travels through the perpetually grid - locked traffic of @entity3 , he moves in a black armored @entity225 with the license plate " 8 " on the front			1
a pair of motorcycle cops escort his convoy			0
his gym , located in the working class neighborhood of @entity233 , is decorated with huge posters of the champion , as well as an undeniably cute cartoon statue of the goateed fighter that could be described as " @entity238			2
" cameras from more than a dozen @entity8 television crews click and whir as @entity26 spars in the ring for an hour with @entity188 , the stocky trainer who winces when he occasionally takes hits to his round belly			1
some of the younger neighborhood boxers who have gathered to watch appear to have adopted haircuts and goatees similar to the man whose rapid - fire punches helped earn him the local nickname " @entity250			2
" but @entity188 says @entity26 has n't started the most intense period of his training yet			0
this will begin in the next few days when @entity254 flies to @entity255 to work with @entity256 , the @entity44 coach who helped the @entity8 achieve global stardom over the last decade			1
" my relationship to @entity256 is amazing , " @entity26 says			0
" since i met him , that was in 2001 , and until now , i did n't change my trainer because we understand each other			0
" but @entity256 will not be available to work with @entity26 until after march because he is in @entity264 training another boxer			0
as for @entity26 , he has at least one more professional basketball game to coach in @entity3 before he flies to the @entity44 since his rise to superstardom , @entity26 's activities and interests have multiplied			1
in addition to basketball and scuba diving off the beaches of @entity192 , he has dabbled in singing , acting and politics			1
several years ago , he won an election to a seat in the @entity280			0
@entity26 proudly points to legislation he says he helped pass aimed at curbing the scourge of human trafficking in the @entity8			1
but one local newspaper has also highlighted that @entity286 has one of the lowest attendance rates in the entire legislative body , pointing out that the boxer could boast more championship belts than days physically spent in @entity280			0
@entity26 insists that instead of networking in the capital , he focuses on helping poor people in his electoral district			0
" if you compare my accomplishments to other congressmen , i think i did a lot , " he says			0
some critics argue @entity26 's boxing has suffered due to his many other distractions			0
" he 's spreading himself thin , " says @entity172 , the newspaper columnist			0
@entity172 points to @entity26 's knock - out at the hands of @entity305 in 2012			2
" i hope @entity26 could win [ on may 2 ] , i 've been praying , " @entity172 says			0
but the journalist fears @entity26 may not be able to break through @entity43 's much - vaunted defense			1
" he 's got to adopt a more mature style of boxing			0
he can not rely on what we call an explosive , kamikaze style , " @entity172 tells @entity4			1
back on court at the @entity16 , @entity26 's @entity31 still trails by several points			2
but they soon manage to pick up some momentum and for the first time , take the lead			0
the boxer stalks the sidelines , watching closely , exchanging high - fives when his players come on and off the court			1
when the final horn sounds , @entity26 's underdogs have beaten their better - ranked opponents -- an upset unlikely to be lost on him as he plots his own success against a more fancied opponent in the ring .			1

@entity4 meets the @entity8 fighter on court in @entity3 , where he coaches a basketball team
the 36 - year - old ring legend has also dabbled in politics in his *homeland*
