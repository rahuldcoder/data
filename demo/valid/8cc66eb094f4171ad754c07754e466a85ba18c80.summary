the family of @entity4 , the teen killed last year by @entity6 police officer @entity5 , will file a civil wrongful death lawsuit in the case " very shortly , " attorney @entity0 said thursday			1
neither he nor attorney @entity9 would say exactly when the suit would be filed , but they said that they disagreed with the grand jury 's and the @entity15 's decisions not to charge @entity5 in the shooting			1
" they have accepted ( @entity5 's ) self - defense , " @entity9 told reporters			2
" we do not accept his self - defense			0
" the slain teen 's parents , @entity4 and @entity23 , were in attendance at the news conference but did not speak on advice of their attorneys , @entity9 said			0
" the last 24 hours have been tough for them , " he said			0
word of the lawsuit comes a day after the @entity15 determined there was not sufficient evidence to charge @entity5 in @entity4 's death but found in a separate investigation that the @entity35 showed a pattern of racial bias			1
@entity4 and @entity23 released a statement wednesday saying they were disappointed that @entity5 would not face charges , but , they added , the federal report on the police department could provide a silver lining			2
" we are encouraged that the @entity15 will hold the @entity35 accountable for the pattern of racial bias and profiling they found in their handling of interactions with people of color , " the statement said			2
" it is our hope that through this action , true change will come not only in @entity6 , but around the country			0
if that change happens , our son 's death will not have been in vain			0
" in november , a grand jury cleared @entity5 and , in an uncharacteristic move in grand jury proceedings , the prosecutor released all the evidence that was considered			1
@entity0 said the civil lawsuit will rely on " pretty much the same evidence , " but it will be cast differently			1
the jury in the civil lawsuit will be asked to make a determination based on a lower burden of proof -- by a preponderance of evidence , rather than beyond a reasonable doubt , @entity9 said			1
summing up the crux of the @entity4 family 's case , @entity9 said , " there were other alternatives available to ( @entity5 )			0
he did not have to kill @entity4			0
