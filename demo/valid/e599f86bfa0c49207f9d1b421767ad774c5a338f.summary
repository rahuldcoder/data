the first official visit of @entity3 president @entity2 to @entity4 comes as excitement mounts over the possibility that direct peace negotiations between the @entity3 government and the @entity9 are imminent			1
the visit , which began sunday , offers the opportunity for discussion and progress on a number of fronts , the coming face - to - face talks with the @entity9 almost certainly among them			0
but while the start of such talks would certainly be a positive development , it would hardly be a sign that peace is about to descend upon a land ravaged by decades of war			0
the reality is that an agreement with the @entity9 that is good for the @entity3 government is probably impossible right now			1
negotiations to end the @entity9 insurgency face a series of significant challenges , and an imperfect deal could harm @entity3 's nascent unity government , encourage the formation of splinter groups of hardened fighters , boost existing terrorist groups like @entity38 and @entity39 and plunge the country into an era of renewed violence and instability			1
that said , the @entity45 should remain broadly supportive of these talks by promoting conditions that could make the possibility of success more likely down the road -- history has shown that successful negotiations most often occur when each party has some vulnerability to the other			1
militarily , the @entity9 is not the @entity3 government 's equal , but that does not mean the insurgents lack a strong negotiating position			1
for a start , the international presence in @entity3 is declining , freeing the @entity9 to operate more openly in the rural corners of the country			1
meanwhile , @entity3 security forces are being killed at rates that are probably not sustainable and civilian casualties are at an all - time high			1
most troublingly , the new national unity government has yet to clearly demonstrate its ability to govern			0
all this means that until the new government shows that the diverse interests within it can coexist , and it articulates a cohesive strategy to counter the @entity9 , the insurgents can make a strong case for postponing peace in the hopes of a better situation in the future			0
a second key to negotiating a path toward peace in @entity3 is devising a strategy to contain splinter groups			1
often in the course of negotiations , those unsatisfied with the peace process flock to new organizations to continue the fight			0
these can include so - called " bitter enders , " hardened fighters who want no part of peace			0
the emergence of splinter groups is an expected part of any peace negotiation process , but it must be minimized for an agreement to take hold			0
in the case of @entity3 , there is no shortage of groups willing to absorb fighters , from outlaw bandit groups to @entity38			2
recently , as @entity2 has highlighted , there have even been stories of fighters declaring allegiance to terrorist group @entity39			2
it goes without saying that the spread of @entity39 's particularly violent form of extremism within @entity3 would make an already complex and precarious security situation all the more so			2
finally , negotiations must happen at a time when a peace agreement can reasonably be enforced -- it is one thing to craft a compromise and quite another to carry it out			0
too often in peace negotiations , an agreement is viewed as a finish line , but any deal can easily be derailed by unpopular political accommodations , economic incentives and rebel fighters who refuse to drop their arms			0
to take hold , peace agreements require a legitimate and effective government capable of communicating new realities to the public and executing policies that are often untried and complex			0
at the moment , the @entity3 government is struggling to carry out existing policies , while juggling the country 's many divergent interests			2
while a peace agreement would certainly boost the legitimacy of a national unity government , a stillborn accord would only lead to disillusionment and doubt			0
ultimately , the chances that talks between the @entity3 government and the @entity9 will succeed are remote at best			2
yet the @entity45 should do everything it can to help create the underlying conditions to support productive negotiations -- if not now , at some point in the future			2
what can the @entity45 do ? two things : first , the @entity154 administration could agree to the @entity3 government 's request to slow @entity45 troop withdrawals			1
this would allow the @entity45 to assist the @entity3 government to stabilize the country and contain any splintering anti-government factions			1
second , the @entity45 could remain actively engaged in promoting the success of the @entity3 national unity government			1
this means not merely maintaining existing development and economic efforts , but finding opportunities to assist the new government to boost its legitimacy			0
for example , the @entity45 could support emerging efforts to build a meaningful relationship between @entity3 and its neighbor @entity174 , which would increase public confidence in the government 's ability to protect its people			1
it also could lend a hand advising political leaders , including the many first - time cabinet officials , on governance and public service			0
sowing the seeds of future success in bringing peace to @entity3 requires no new @entity45 boots on the ground or extravagant financial commitments			1
rather , it takes a willingness to continue to engage with @entity3 's dynamic set of political challenges in small , but meaningful ways .			0
