@entity0 , @entity1 when she was just 4 years old , @entity4 went blind in her left eye			1
then , two years later , she lost hearing in her right ear			1
now 24 , @entity9 might have been spared years of struggle if her rare eye condition -- known as @entity13 disease -- had been caught earlier			2
not wanting other children to feel the same frustration , anger and limitations , @entity9 launched a nonprofit that offers free vision and hearing screenings to school - age children -- particularly from lower income communities			1
here 's a stunning statistic : 25 % of @entity25 children ages 5 - 17 suffer from vision problems , according to the @entity27			1
nonetheless , eight states still fail to require vision screenings at schools			1
undetected and untreated , eye disorders can result in delayed reading and poorer academic outcomes			2
@entity9 's organization , the @entity34 , has screened nearly 9,000 children in @entity36 and @entity1 since its 2013 launch			0
as you might guess , the name honors @entity40 -- who overcame blindness and hearing loss as an infant			1
before her death in 1968 , @entity40 learned to speak and then eventually earned degrees from @entity47 and @entity48 , inspiring countless people around the world			0
" when i learned about @entity40 for the first time in the fourth grade , i surmised that i am half blind and half deaf like half @entity40 , " said @entity9			1
" what better role model than to name a nonprofit after the most extraordinary woman who overcame obstacles being blind and deaf ? " do you know a hero ? nominations are open for @entity62 2015 i talked with @entity9 about the motivation behind her work			1
below is an edited version of our conversation			0
@entity2 : you do vision screenings right in the schools			1
how does it work ? @entity4 : we use our tool , the @entity78 camera			1
this device allows us to test for the six most common vision impairments in children in seconds			2
we are looking to see if they 're near - sighted , if they 're far - sighted , if they have astigmatism , or if they 're at risk for conditions like lazy eye or strabismus or if there 's a difference in pupil size			0
the @entity78 camera is a hand - held autorefractor that takes a picture of a child 's eyes			2
it has multi-colored @entity100 -- a red , blue and green light that flashes			0
children tell me it looks like a video game			0
often i 'm trying to get the child to look straight into the camera			2
so once i capture their attention , the camera will capture the image and the screening is done			0
we learn so much more about a child 's vision health in a fraction of the time it takes to do a basic eye chart test			1
after the screening , we deliver referral reports to the school health aide to distribute to the families			0
the families communicate directly with us if they need assistance in seeking corrective wear or access to an eye care professional			0
if a child passes , all the better			2
but if a child fails , then we 've found one who we can help , and that 's one less child who has to know the struggle or the headaches or the frustration from not being able to see			2
see more @entity62 @entity2 : your efforts first started in @entity36			1
why did you choose to focus on @entity1 next ? @entity9 : the state of @entity1 currently does not require vision or hearing screenings in schools			1
so it has been left to the hands of service or civic organizations			0
only certain schools on the island were receiving vision screenings , when it was convenient			1
it was n't being done ( systematically )			2
so i reached out to some civic groups here that had been conducting screenings and asked if i could come out and present how we do our work			2
and they , in turn , invited me to come out for a year and pilot our @entity0 528 program			0
it 's the perfect pilot group size			0
with 21,000 students and the technology available , we calculated it would actually take us about 528 hours to screen all 21,000 students			0
@entity2 : how can a vision problem affect a child 's education ? @entity9 : a child 's learning can be set back several years by not being able to see the words on the page or if they 're at a slant , if they 're blurred , if they 're nonexistent			1
they lose that self - confidence in their learning , that drive to push them forward , all because they were never screened for a potential condition that is easily correctable			0
it 's so commonly assumed that you can see a problem			0
i was 4 years old , and i had no visual symptoms			0
a common misunderstanding with the need for these services is that if a child has a vision problem , they 'll tell you			1
how can they tell you if that 's the only reality they know ? because preventative care is the most important thing we can provide , and we have a way now to conduct it so efficiently and effectively , there 's no reason not to provide this service			0
i would like to see every state require preventative screenings in order to ensure that every student has an equal opportunity to the best education possible			1
that 's our way forward			0
@entity2 : where does the name of your organization come from ? @entity9 : when i learned about @entity40 for the first time in the fourth grade , i surmised that i am half blind and half deaf like half @entity40			1
so that became the nickname from fourth grade on			0
and then when i graduated from college and i realized what my purpose was in this life , i realized what better role model than to name a nonprofit after the most extraordinary woman who overcame obstacles being blind and deaf ? @entity40 did so many extraordinary things with her life , i can only hope to be half as wonderful as she is			1
want to get involved ? check out the @entity236 - @entity34 website at @entity237 and see how to help .			0

eight @entity25 states do n't require vision and hearing screenings in schools
after going partially blind and deaf as a child , @entity4 created a solution
