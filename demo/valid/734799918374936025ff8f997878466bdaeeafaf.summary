congratulations , internet haters ! well done , keepers of the one - true - way - to - talk - about - race ! if we do n't tamp down the backlash against @entity9 " campaign , i fear that no major corporation will even try to talk about race again -- for maybe 10 or 20 years			1
is that really what we want ? look , i get it			2
asking baristas to hold conversations about race is a lot to demand of already hard - working employees			2
not to mention , the topic should probably be called " systematic racism , " not just " race			2
" and there are legitimate questions about what @entity9 could realistically hope to accomplish , here			1
but for crying out loud ! in the past 48 hours , racial justice activists have spilled more digital ink criticizing @entity9 for trying to fight racism than they have against other ( actually racist ) companies			1
the truth is that we can not have it both ways			2
we can not demand that companies address race , and then attack them when they try			1
yes , it seems like harmless fun to pile on or retweet the snark			0
at some point , all of us have enjoyed the cheap thrill one gets by kicking around a big company online			1
but the cost this time is that no corporation will want to do anything creative or constructive on racial subjects for a very long time			0
in fact , some activists are responding with such little sympathy , empathy and grace , that other corporations are like to run the other way			0
again , is that what we want ? @entity57 , an @entity58 member of the @entity9 board and a personal friend , is a major supporter of this campaign			1
how will other corporate boards react in the future when a minority member encourages the company to publicly address issues of racial inclusion ? @entity9 is trying to make a positive difference			1
if the company gets rewarded , others will follow			0
but nobody wants their brand to get beaten up			0
at some point in the future , activists will launch an online petition or protest against a company guilty of some legitimately racist behavior			1
but how seriously will anyone take us , when even the " good guys " end up getting kicked in the teeth and called racist -- for trying to oppose bigotry ? modern science tells us that bias lives on , in even the most dedicated anti-racist			0
the only cure is talking about it			0
our country needs more open discussion of race , not less			0
companies who try to further that discussion should be rewarded , even if their initial attempts are imperfect			2
we can put forward suggestions and criticisms in a constructive manner : " this is a great first step , @entity99 ! here are five ways to improve the campaign -- and make it even better			0
" i think any human anywhere would be open to hearing that kind of feedback			2
but nobody wants to be called an idiot , just for trying			0
unfortunately , today 's vicious backlash against @entity9 could become a case study in proving that -- when it comes to race -- no good deed goes unpunished			1
ironically , after all this is over , @entity9 will still sell plenty of lattes			1
the people who will suffer the most are the ones who said they wanted a conversation on race in the first place -- but then would n't take " yes " for an answer .			0

@entity9 was trashed by many online for its " @entity125 " initiative
@entity128 : what kind of lesson will this have for other companies that try to do the right thing ?
