the president of @entity2 has an idea on how to curtail the spread of @entity5 : get everybody to stay inside			1

" the campaign will provide an opportunity for communities to be directly involved in the drive to zero cases , to reflect and to pray for the eradication of this disease from our country , " he said in a statement			0
@entity20 tried a three - day lockdown last september in what was primarily an informational campaign , with volunteers going door - to - door to talk with residents about the virus			1
in august , the @entity29 government locked down one of the poorest neighborhoods in the capital of @entity33 in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus			2
the move resulted in riots			0
no commercial activity is supposed to occur during the upcoming lockdown , @entity7 said			2
