each weighed between 25 and 27 pounds , together about 275 pounds			0
the bars ' total weight in gold is worth about $ 4.8 million			1
but what about the story of how they got swiped on sunday from a truck alongside @entity12 in @entity13 ? investigators are trying to figure that out , including how two armed security guards could have been so quickly pounced upon , bound and then robbed so soon after pulling over in @entity17 , as they 've told authorities			1
" there 's suspicion about everything going on in this case , " @entity17 sheriff @entity19 said wednesday in a news conference about the case			0
he also released composite sketches of two of the three suspects , one of whom he described as a heavyset @entity30 male with a @entity32 accent and the other as a dark - skinned @entity30 male with a white mustache and goatee who was dressed in black			0
he showed reporters a photo of the white van they allegedly got away in , as well as an image of the traffic cones they used -- which came from a @entity45 company that does n't do business in @entity13			1
what he could n't say definitively was whether these men had some help			2
there are a lot of questions , in fact , that ca n't be answered			0
authorities say the initial statements from the two guards who work for @entity58 , a @entity45 - based company that transports valuables , were a bit confusing due to the guards ' spotty @entity61 , though @entity63 said police now have a clearer picture after bringing in @entity67 - speakers to translate			1
these two men , both of whom have worked for @entity58 for several years , set off early sunday morning from @entity70 with a truck full of gold protected by a padlock and presumably their firearms			1
they were headed for @entity77 , @entity78 , " to a place ... where they handled such things , " @entity76 explained			0
they stopped to get gas in @entity84 , @entity85 , then hit the interstate once again			0
the guards later told police they smelled gas , with one of them getting sick			1
that leads to the first big question about the men 's story : did something happen to their vehicle to cause the gas smell ? not according to a @entity17 mechanic , who " did not determine any type of issues " with the truck , according to @entity76			1
so the sicker guard gets out of the vehicle			0
he says he 's quickly met by two suspects , who yell out , " @entity105 , policia			0
" they ask him to go to the ground then tie him up with three zip ties , according to @entity76			0
after this , the other guard gets out of the vehicle			0
he encounters the same men -- one of them wearing a red traffic vest -- who repeat that they are police			1
he says that he , too , eventually gets to the ground and is bound with duck tape			2
but were n't these armed guards ? yes and no. neither man had a gun on them when they exited their vehicle , violating their company 's protocol , the sheriff said			2
and did anyone see them get bound and led into the nearby woods ? no , at least no one who has contacted police			1
but people called authorities around 6:49 p.m. sunday after they spotted the men , still bound , coming out of the woods , according to @entity76			1
by then , the $ 4.8 million in gold and the three men suspected of taking it were gone			2
that 's left authorities trying to track those valuables down and piece together exactly what happened			2
investigators have already gone to @entity85 , and they 're getting help from the @entity147			0
they 're all working to get information out of places between @entity45 and @entity13 , to try to corroborate the guards ' stories and uncover any evidence that might identify the suspected thieves			1
@entity76 says @entity58 has been " very cooperative " in the investigation , as have the company 's two guards			2
neither was injured beyond some scratches on their legs from going into the woods			0
" right now , ( the guards ) are still considered victims , " @entity76 said , declining to answer whether or not authorities believe this was an inside job			1
" ... but we 're investigating every avenue			0

a truck *filled* with gold bars pulled over alongside @entity12 in @entity13
two guards say they were both bound by men claiming to be police
authorities are trying to determine if it may have been an inside job
