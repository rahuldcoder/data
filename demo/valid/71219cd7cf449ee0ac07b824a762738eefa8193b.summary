my vote for @entity2 goes to @entity4			1
the former @entity6 pitcher recently fired off a series of fastballs and mowed down a group of @entity11 trolls who made the mistake of tweeting vulgar and sexually - explicit comments about @entity4 's teenage daughter			1
the drama started , innocently enough , on february 25 , when @entity4 played the role of a proud father			1
he sent a tweet congratulating his daughter , @entity21 , on being accepted to @entity22 , where she 'll play softball			1
it read : " congrats to @entity26 who will pitch for the @entity28 next year ! ! â€” @entity4 ( @ gehrig38 ) " almost immediately , responses came in from young men , complete strangers who apparently followed @entity4 on @entity11			1
the tweets quickly went from immature , to creepy , to repugnant			2
threats of rape were common			2
the tweets were deleted , and the accounts were closed after this story went viral			2
but not before @entity4 captured some of the images and posted them on his blog			1
what was said about 17 - year - old @entity26 was n't just obnoxious			2
it was vile and obscene			2
what was said was n't just mean and ugly			2
it was threatening and scary			2
as a parent , it 's the kind of thing that makes you rethink your opposition to public caning as a logical punishment for such transgressions			2
these misogynistic cowards may have thought they could hide in the darkness of anonymity , the sort that many have come to expect from social media sites , where you feel free to be a despicable human being because , you think , no one will ever find out who you really are and hold you accountable for your words			1
if so , they thought wrong			2
they were found out , and they got the throttling they so richly deserved			0
according to @entity4 , who made it his mission to track down these cretins and make sure those they associate with know who they really are , two people have already paid a price due to their tweets			1
one was a student disc jockey at a community college in @entity80 , who was suspended , and the other was a part - time ticket seller for the @entity84 , who was fired			0
concerned that this is an example of exactly the kind of cyberbullying that leads some teenagers to commit suicide , @entity4 is also thinking about taking legal action against some of the other people involved			1
i 'm sure that , all across @entity101 , dads with daughters -- after reading some of the horrible things that were said about this young girl -- are marveling at @entity4 's self - control			1
i have two daughters of my own , and he 's a better man than me			0
if ever there was a case where profanity - spewing malcontents deserved to have their mouths washed out with soap , this is it			0
so what additional insights can we draw , and what larger lessons can we learn , from this unexpected but predictable collision of old - fashioned parenthood and newfangled media ? there are a few			1
the first is about accountability , the very thing that the young men who posted these hurtful messages were trying to avoid			0
but @entity4 would n't let them			1
at their best , social media sites like @entity11 , @entity124 , @entity125 and others allow the sharing the information and the building of a sense of community			1
at their worst , they become digital sandboxes and locker rooms where people think have a license to misbehave without having to worry about consequences			0
we need to applaud efforts like this that promote greater online accountability			1
there 's also something to be said about protective parents , and how essential they are to a working society			0
we should still be concerned about those overprotective parents who hover like helicopters from little league to job interviews			0
we should n't bubblewrap our kids , and keep them from playing outdoors , and then sit around wondering why they 're soft , timid , and risk - averse			0
but protective parents -- the kind who shield their kids from real danger -- never go out of style			0
a parent 's top job is to protect his children			0
finally , it 's worth reminding everyone that freedom of expression does not mean freedom from rules , standards , and expectations that should guide your behavior			0
there are things you do n't say			0
there are boundaries , ways that we expect you to behave so you do n't terrorize other people or bring shame upon yourself , your friends , and your family			0
if you do n't have social skills , you do n't belong on social media			1
the tweets make you wince			0
but in this story , you 'll still find plenty to smile about			0
this whole drama unfolded because @entity4 was proud of his daughter			1
now , given how he reacted , we all have reason to be proud of him			0

@entity192 : @entity4 deserves *praise* for taking on online haters for offensive comments about his daughter
@entity192 : in protecting his child , @entity4 set a model for parenting and taught us a lesson about social media
