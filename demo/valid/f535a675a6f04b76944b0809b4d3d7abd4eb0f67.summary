after spending much of her 2008 campaign seemingly running away from the fact that she is a woman , @entity0 is showing signs that 2016 is going to be a different story			1
it seems that @entity0 has found her outer woman , which is to say , she 's found the person that she wants to present on the campaign trail , and that person is resolutely female			1
this time she seems to have decided to fully embrace her womanhood as an asset in her quest for the @entity16 and to trust that the voters will do the same			0
of course , @entity0 has n't officially announced that she will be running for president -- and @entity19 has not officially announced that there will be a sequel to the blockbuster " @entity22			1
" but it 's hard to imagine 2016 happening without both of those things , seeing as how they both have such excellent prospects of success			0
@entity0 recently spoke at a @entity30 conference for women in the tech field with the theme of " @entity34			1
" that lent itself nicely to the professional goals of the members of the audience as well as to @entity0 's own leadership goals			1
she spoke of the dearth of women not only in the tech field , but in the ranks of @entity45 ceo 's			0
in fact , one recent diversity study found that the major @entity49 company boards had more men with the name @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , or @entity55 on them than women of any name combined			0
left unsaid in her speech was any reference to the complete lack of a female occupant of the @entity63 thus far , but the thought could not have been far from anyone 's mind , let alone @entity0 's			1
@entity67 was comfortable talking at length about her own experiences being pregnant and giving birth while working as a partner in a law firm , and using that as a launching pad to discuss the importance of women in the workforce both here and around the world			1
and from there she highlighted her own work on behalf of the women of the world as secretary of state			0
she segued into the discussion of the plight of working middle - class families that will be so central to the 2016 race , and the centrality of women 's economic issues to those struggles of the middle - class			2
from there it was a natural progression to talking about 21st century families and the importance of things such as paid leave			0
and all of that dovetailed perfectly into closing remarks about the future that revolved naturally around the birth in september of @entity67 's first grandchild , @entity107			1
that brought up @entity0 's new role as a grandmother , and the perspective it has given her on the future and what needs to be done to guarantee that it 's the best possible future			2
the @entity30 address could serve as a template for how @entity67 intends to approach her career goals from the vantage point of being a woman seeking her own place in the workforce			1
in the coming weeks , which serendipitously happen to be part of @entity126 , @entity0 's speaking schedule is heavy with events and gatherings that center around women			2
if she 's not running for president , then she could be gearing up to get a talk show on the @entity133 network			0
all of which stands in stark contrast to @entity0 's last presidential campaign			1
in 2008 , she seemed to think that she had to reassure voters that a woman could be president , primarily by not accentuating the fact that she was a woman			1
this time around , there seems to be a shared assumption that , of course , a woman would make an excellent president , in part simply by virtue of being a woman			2
in that previous campaign , @entity0 ran as the most experienced candidate , primarily to draw a distinction between herself and her relatively less experienced challenger , @entity151			1
but now , almost eight years later , @entity67 can let her experience speak for itself			1
she has more of it -- almost too much , from one perspective : she 'll be 69 by the time the 2016 election takes place			0
so this time instead of highlighting her experience , she 's highlighting the experiences she has in common with the women , mothers and grandmothers out there			0
of course , @entity0 's message will have to resonate beyond female voters			2
fortunately , the dynamics of the 21st century economy and the place of the family within it lend themselves to a family - friendly feminism			0
we live in a society where women are necessary breadwinners whose income is counted upon for families to make it			0
gender pay equality and supportive work environments benefit spouses , children , extended families and entire communities			0
today , feminism , family and economic issues intertwine like never before			0
@entity0 's stressing of the importance of women 's workplace issues both to the family and to the struggles of the middle - class puts the @entity191 on the defensive as they try to co-opt middle - class economic issues			1
potential @entity191 presidential candidates are already trying to position themselves to steal the thunder of the @entity197 nominee when it comes to issues of wage inequality and middle - class stagnation			2
but how exactly do they propose to reinvigorate a middle - class that is overwhelmingly composed of families with two wage - earners if they do n't fight for women 's workplace issues ? for instance , child care may be thought of as a woman 's issue , but it 's really a family issue , virtually by definition , and an economic issue on top of that			2
among topics that are sometimes seen as more traditional women 's issues such as family planning , access to birth control and the right to choose , @entity0 has the advantage in that she can make her stance clear , based on her life experiences as a woman			1
it 's the @entity191 with extremist views on these issues who have to dance around their real beliefs and avoid making outrageous and absurd statements such as embarrassing pronouncements about rape and pregnancy			0
if @entity0 seems more comfortable running as a woman , it 's partly because society at large seems more comfortable with a populist - tinged feminism than it was in 2008			1
@entity243 's @entity242 night speech in support of equal pay for women -- although predictably dismissed by right - wing media such as @entity248 -- was enthusiastically received by the public in general			0
in fact , far from being thought radical , @entity243 's statements backstage were thoroughly deconstructed by the left for not being progressively correct enough			0
women have been steadily making strides in the years since @entity0 's 2008 campaign , and as they did , they smoothed the way for one of their own to run for the highest office in the land without having to play down her gender			1
@entity0 is now wisely embracing her gender as a way of capturing the same " hope and change " historical quality of @entity151 's presidency			1
voters always want change , and @entity0 has been a constant on the political stage for decades now			2
she 's certainly no stranger to @entity268 , or to the @entity269 of the @entity16			0
but electing her president would still represent massive change on a fundamental level			0
@entity0 wants 2016 to be the @entity273			2
and she wants to be the woman .			0

@entity276 : in 2008 , @entity0 *de-emphasized* gender and ran on her experience
now @entity67 is positioning her potential campaign to focus on history - making election of a woman president
