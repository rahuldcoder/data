@entity4 the defense in the trial of @entity3 bomber @entity2 rested tuesday afternoon after presenting only four witnesses			1
closing arguments are scheduled for monday			2
the defense case lasted less than two days , while the prosecution presented more than 90 witnesses over the course of a month			1
federal prosecutors rested their case monday with grisly testimony about how the bomb @entity2 placed near the marathon 's finish line tore through the bodies of 8 - year - old @entity19 and @entity20 , a 23 - year - old grad student			1
a second bomb placed by @entity2 's brother , @entity22 , killed @entity23 , a 29 - year - old restaurant manager			1
the short presentation in the sensational trial was n't surprising , given that @entity2 's attorney , @entity26 , acknowledged during opening statements that " it was him , " referring to her client 's culpability			1
testimony ended with an @entity34 fingerprint investigator who talked about numerous pieces of evidence with @entity22 's fingerprints and not @entity2 's			1
earlier , a computer expert testified about computer searches on @entity22 's computer -- including gun stores , transmitters , fireworks firing system , detonator and @entity3 -- in the weeks before the bombing			2
similar searches were not found on @entity2 's computer			1
jurors first will be asked to determine whether @entity2 is guilty of 30 counts			1
because 17 of those counts carry the death penalty as a possible punishment , a second phase of the trial will follow if the jury convicts him			2
in the penalty phase , jurors will be asked to weigh aggravating factors , such as the heinousness of the crime , versus mitigating factors , such as @entity2 's family history and his youth			1
he was 19 at the time of the bombings			2
the defense , which began calling witnesses monday afternoon , has argued that @entity2 , known to friends as @entity73 , fell under the sway of his more extremist older brother after their parents moved back to @entity78			1
@entity79 was flunking out of the @entity80 and had lost his financial aid at the time of the bombings			2
prosecutors @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 presented witnesses who told the story of @entity2 's alleged scheme with @entity22 to build and detonate pressure cooker bombs as an act of jihad			1
the brothers , @entity95 of @entity97 descent , allegedly sought to kill @entity98 at an iconic public event to retaliate against @entity98 policies they believed harmed and oppressed @entity95 abroad			0
prosecutors delved into @entity2 's text messages and @entity103 posts and showed jurors militant material found in his laptop , phone and @entity109			1
they included writings available online from top leaders of @entity112			0
they used data mined from a gps device and store receipts to trace the purchase of the pressure cookers , bbs and ammunition			0
jurors saw photos of pressure cooker parts , fuses , @entity126 lights and other bombmaking materials found in the @entity2 family 's @entity129 apartment , where @entity22 lived with his wife and child			1
and they showed security surveillance videos of the brothers in the crowd near the finish line : in one , @entity2 can be seen blending in with the crowd behind the @entity130 for four minutes			1
he appears to slide a backpack off his shoulder near a tree and walk off , glancing over his shoulder			0
he broke into a run as the bomb went off			0
after the surveillance photos were released to the public three days after the bombing , the brothers allegedly embarked on a desperate -- and deadly -- attempt to escape			2
jurors heard from carjacking victim @entity150 and saw the brothers on convenience store surveillance video shortly before @entity150 's escape			0
he can be seen jumping out of his leased @entity154 at a gas pump and running across the screen as @entity2 casually strolls through the store , picking up an armload of snacks			1
prosecutors also used ballistic evidence to link the brothers to the shooting of a campus cop at the @entity165 and a gunbattle with police in @entity168			0
@entity169 , 26 , died as a result of that gunbattle			0
the defendant , allegedly attempting to run down police , instead ran over his brother in the stolen @entity173			0
jurors also viewed a boat in which @entity2 sought refuge during the ensuing manhunt , which put @entity4 under a " shelter in place " lockdown			1
he used a pencil to scrawl what prosecutors called his " manifesto " on the sides of the boat			0
it was pocked with bullet holes and streaked with blood			0
he wrote he was jealous that his brother had achieved paradise by dying like a holy warrior in the gunbattle with police			0
he asked @entity195 to make him a martyr , too			0
@entity2 has pleaded not guilty , although his attorneys do not dispute that he participated in the bombings			2
@entity199 asked jurors in her opening statement to keep their minds open to an alternative explanation			0
the defense began its case with two witnesses called to offer scenarios that differ from the version of events offered by @entity34 witnesses			2
one focused on the the defendant 's @entity103 posts a year before the marathon , including mundane matters such as whether he should sleep in or get breakfast			0
another challenged the way the @entity34 used gps points and store receipts to document the purchase of pressure cookers , bbs and ammunition -- allegedly by @entity169			0
@entity5 's @entity224 contributed to this story .			0

defense in trial of @entity2 rested after less than three days
