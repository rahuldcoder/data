a swarm of insects tends to startle us -- chaotic yet organized , fascinating and beautiful			2
take it one step further			2
instead of bees hovering around a tree , imagine cheese balls			1
solo cups in the place of birds , glow sticks as locusts			1
what seems like a figment of a wild imagination becomes reality in @entity19 's " @entity20 " series			1
@entity19 grew up in @entity21 and worked in publishing in @entity23 for 13 years , ultimately landing his dream gig as an editor with @entity26			1
but somewhere along the way , he picked up a camera			2
he found photography " effortlessly fulfilling " compared to the frequent challenges of writing			2
so he dove in , lens first			2
after a charming series featuring a robot , he struck a cadence in creating " swarms " with inanimate objects such as post-it notes and plastic plates			1
" i started creating these whimsical , fantastic scenarios in which the environment is exploiting us , " @entity19 explained			1
that 's what initially catches the eye -- the uncanny			0
the bizarre gathering in the behavior of insects or birds , made up of something that should n't be there			0
at first , he relied on digital enhancements to polish his illusions			0
but as the series evolved , he relied less on editing and more on the installations themselves			0
more than half of @entity19 's " @entity20 " series is digitally untouched			1
how @entity19 gets a tubful of cheese balls to hang purposefully around the trunk of a tree seems nonsensical			1
he only hints at the mechanics			0
it 's just " wires , " he said , casually , not revealing enough evidence to ruin the magic			0
social media follow @ @entity71 on @entity72 to join the conversation about photography			0
" but if you look close enough , it will reveal all of its secrets			0
" he spends about a day building the installations , and he usually shoots his photos at dusk			0
the photo of the @entity85 cups was shot against mountainous terrain in @entity87			2
the cups , already at odds with nature , look as though they are a flock of birds flying along the rocks			1
@entity19 seemingly casts a magic spell of manic movement , creating what an internet commentator calls " a frat party being sucked into a black hole			1
" the idea of a swarm -- be it insects or " thank you " bags -- fascinates @entity19			1
they are disconcerting and familiar at once , creating a conundrum that warrants a closer look			0
" maybe because they fly in the face of how we see the world , " he said			0
@entity19 is a photographer based in @entity111 , @entity23			1
you can follow him on @entity113 .			0

@entity19 has staged everyday objects to look like swarms in nature
among the items used : solo cups , post-it notes , cheese balls and plastic plates
