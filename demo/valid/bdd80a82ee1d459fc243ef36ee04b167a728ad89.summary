asked of her impressions , she said : " we can do business together			0
we both believe in our own political systems			0
he firmly believes in his ; i firmly believe in mine			0
we are never going to change one another			0
" " doing business together " might sum up the @entity16 - @entity15 relationship today			0
they have overlapping interests in @entity20 , @entity21 , perhaps even in @entity22 -- as well as the shared goal of an agreement on @entity26 's nuclear program , if not how to reach it			1
the @entity29 administration has a keen interest in coaxing @entity26 back into the " community of nations " because it is a regional power , a major player in a volatile part of the world			1
were the nuclear talks to leave @entity26 as a " threshold state " -- capable of becoming a nuclear power in short order -- @entity41 , @entity42 and others in the region also might be tempted also to go nuclear			1
and @entity45 might carry out its threat of a military strike on @entity26 facilities			1
but @entity50 and @entity26 interests converge in more immediate ways			1
defeating the @entity52 in @entity20 and @entity54 ( @entity53 ) -- the most high profile and urgent objective of @entity50 foreign policy -- requires @entity26 help , and quite a lot of it			1
beyond coalition airstrikes , ground forces are comprised of the @entity20 security forces , @entity65 militias and @entity26 advisers and officers			1
in some areas , the @entity26 air force has been active			2
on sunday , @entity20 troops and the militias began an offensive to retake @entity72 and the province of @entity74 from @entity53			0
next to @entity75 , @entity72 may be @entity53 ' most important holding in @entity20			0
on the frontlines , according to the @entity26 @entity78 news agency , was none other than the leader of @entity26 's @entity82 ( or @entity83 ) , @entity84			2
@entity84 -- often dubbed @entity26 's spymaster -- has huge influence in both @entity87 and @entity88			2
and the @entity89 have influence over the powerful @entity65 militia in @entity20 known as @entity92 that is an important component of the fightback against @entity53			0
the @entity95 observed that " the presence of an @entity26 general , other @entity26 advisers , and @entity65 militias on the ground alongside @entity20 @entity102 fighters to retake a major @entity102 provincial capital will be a significant test case for the success of similar future anti-isis operations			2
" and not only is @entity26 help needed in defeating @entity53 , but @entity26 restraint will be required in preserving @entity20 as a single and ( dare one hope ) stable state thereafter			2
to many observers , former @entity20 prime minister @entity111 set the stage for @entity53 ' rise through his increasingly sectarian and @entity116 policies			0
but now the excesses of some @entity65 militia in @entity20 threaten to alienate the @entity102 tribes that @entity111 's successor , @entity120 , is trying to woo			0
in a veiled reference to alleged abuses by @entity65 militia of @entity102 civilians , prime minister @entity120 ordered all forces taking part in the @entity72 operation to take " utmost care in protecting civilian lives and property			0
" but he needs @entity15 's help in reining in the @entity92			0
a similar environment may yet produce a @entity50 - @entity26 " understanding " in @entity22			1
the @entity26 - backed @entity135 militia -- a @entity65 sect -- is now in power ( at least in the capital , @entity139 )			2
the @entity135 are , ostensibly , hostile to the @entity50 , and @entity16 would rather see president @entity140 back in charge			2
but the @entity135 and @entity22 troops are battling @entity143 ( @entity143 ) , which the @entity50 regards as one of @entity143 's most dangerous affiliates			2
even so , the same risk as in @entity20 applies : @entity102 tribes in @entity22 may side with @entity143 as the lesser of two evils , effectively partitioning the country			0
there is no clear - cut link between the negotiations on a nuclear deal and @entity50 - @entity26 co-operation elsewhere			1
last week , @entity50 director of national intelligence @entity155 told a congressional hearing : " i really do n't think that the negotiations , one way or the other , will have much bearing on what [ the @entity26 ] do in @entity20 or any place they are trying to exert their influence , meaning @entity54 or now @entity22			1
" in any case , a substantive agreement on @entity26 's nuclear program does not seem imminent			1
ahead of yet another meeting in @entity170 with @entity26 foreign minister @entity171 , @entity50 secretary of state @entity168 said monday that " unless @entity26 is able to make the difficult decisions that will be required , there wo n't be a deal			1
" and he was at pains to insist the @entity50 would not settle for anything less than a comprehensive , watertight agreement			2
" no deal is better than a bad deal because a bad deal could actually make things less secure , " @entity168 said			0
the @entity45 prime minister , @entity182 , is in the @entity50 to tell @entity183 that the deal being discussed is a bad one -- simultaneously injecting himself into the partisan rancor of @entity16 and seeking to derail what would be the signature foreign policy achievement of @entity29 's second term			1
@entity182 appears to have accepted he is now part and parcel of the toxic atmosphere in @entity16 , saying he was going " because the @entity183 is likely to be the final brake before the agreement between the major powers and @entity26			2
" @entity194 , no fan of @entity29 's policy on @entity26 , wrote in foreign policy last month that " @entity182 's decision to accept [ @entity202 ] @entity198 's invitation to address the @entity183 on the dangers of the @entity26 nuclear deal is a case of sending the wrong man at the wrong time to give the wrong speech in the wrong place			1
" in the days running up to @entity182 's speech , @entity50 officials have lined up to warn of its consequences			2
national security advisor @entity212 said the speech would be " destructive of the fabric of the relationship " between @entity45 and the @entity50 rarely if ever has the @entity50 - @entity45 relationship become so imbued with such animosity			2
last summer , @entity45 ministers ridiculed @entity168 's efforts to secure a ceasefire in @entity221 ; @entity182 has also repeatedly lectured @entity29 about the realities of the @entity223			0
now @entity168 seems to take almost gratuitous pleasure in telling @entity182 he is wrong			0
last week he told the @entity225 that interim agreements with @entity26 had made @entity45 safer , and the @entity45 prime minister " was wrong " to oppose them , just as he had been wrong in his enthusiastic support for the @entity50 invasion of @entity20 in 2003			1
some have even suggested that @entity182 's aggressive opposition has only energized @entity50 officials in the belief that " if they 're doing something that really pisses off @entity182 , they must be doing something right , " as @entity194 colorfully put it			2
no one would pretend that @entity50 has more in common with the @entity26 than with @entity45			1
but right now , @entity29 may just feel he 's more likely to find common ground with @entity26 president @entity240 than with the @entity45 prime minister			1
even so , the opportunities to " do business " should not be exaggerated			0
@entity26 is still supporting -- with fighters , equipment , training and lines of credit -- @entity249 's regime in @entity54 , which the @entity50 is trying to oust			1
@entity26 and @entity54 first bonded over a mutual loathing of @entity251 , but the relationship has been sustained because the @entity54 regime was the only @entity254 government in the @entity256 world , and @entity88 and @entity15 see themselves as the " axis of resistance " to @entity45			1
@entity26 training of militia such as the @entity261 has been critical to the @entity249 regime 's survival			1
a former @entity54 prime minister , @entity264 , said after defecting that " @entity54 is occupied by the @entity26 regime			1
the person who runs the country is not @entity249 but @entity84			0
" sanctions have made it difficult for @entity26 to afford its hefty subsidies to the @entity249 regime -- so ironically , a nuclear agreement and the easing of sanctions might have the unintended consequence of allowing @entity26 to continue its support of @entity249			1
nor is there any sign that @entity26 is ready to soften its support for the @entity65 militia @entity280 , its frontline proxy in the confrontation with @entity45			0
eighteen months ago , columnist @entity283 quoted an @entity26 source as saying that " @entity280 to @entity26 is n't a card to play with			0
@entity280 today is the crown jewel of the resistance bloc , " answerable not to the @entity26 president but to supreme leader @entity289			0
there 's no sign that posture has changed , and it 's a reminder that on all these issues , president @entity240 is not the only -- or even the most powerful -- decision - maker in @entity26			0
all the same , the achievement of a nuclear deal - and the gradual lifting of @entity50 and international sanctions against @entity26 -- would surely change the mood music			1
it might open other doors and enhance dialogue on other issues			0
and regardless of progress on the nuclear front , the @entity50 and @entity26 will continue to share antipathy for the apocalyptic vision of @entity53 , and an interest in buttressing @entity20 as a viable state			1
even as a candidate for the presidency , @entity29 set out a vision for engaging with @entity26 , not least to help bring stability to @entity20			0
" my decision making , with respect to military options versus diplomatic options , a containment strategy versus a strike strategy , " he told the @entity315 in november 2007 , " is going to be informed by how is that going to impact not just @entity26 , but how is that going to impact the stability of the region and how 's that going to impact our long - term security interests			0
" eight years on , it is diplomacy and containment that are the centerpiece of his administration 's thrust for a signature achievement on the world stage			0
and it ca n't hurt that the @entity50 and @entity26 find themselves on the same side , for now , in @entity20 .			1

*longtime* foes @entity50 and @entity26 now find themselves on same side of some critical conflicts
a nuclear deal would *loosen* sanctions on @entity26 , and allow it to devote more *resources* to propping up @entity249 regime in @entity54
