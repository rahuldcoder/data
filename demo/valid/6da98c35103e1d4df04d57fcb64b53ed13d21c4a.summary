the only thing crazier than a guy in snowbound @entity3 boxing up the powdery white stuff and offering it for sale online ? people are actually buying it			2
for $ 89 , self - styled entrepreneur @entity10 will ship you 6 pounds of @entity13 - area snow in an insulated @entity14 -- enough for 10 to 15 snowballs , he says			1
but not if you live in @entity15 or surrounding states			0
" we will not ship snow to any states in the northeast ! " says @entity18 's website , @entity19			1
" we 're in the business of expunging snow ! " his website and social media accounts claim to have filled more than 133 orders for snow -- more than 30 on tuesday alone , his busiest day yet			0
with more than 45 total inches , @entity13 has set a record this winter for the snowiest month in its history			1
most residents see the huge piles of snow choking their yards and sidewalks as a nuisance , but @entity10 saw an opportunity			0
according to @entity41 , it all started a few weeks ago , when @entity10 and his wife were shoveling deep snow from their yard in @entity45 , a coastal suburb north of @entity13			1
he joked about shipping the stuff to friends and family in warmer states , and an idea was born			1
his business slogan : " our nightmare is your dream ! " at first , @entity57 sold snow packed into empty 16.9 - ounce water bottles for $ 19.99 , but the snow usually melted before it reached its destination			2
so this week , @entity10 began shipping larger amounts in the @entity14 cubes , which he promises will arrive anywhere in the @entity65 in less than 20 hours			2
he also has begun selling a 10 - pound box of snow for $ 119			1
many of his customers appear to be companies in warm - weather states who are buying the snow as a gag , he said			1
whether @entity10 can sustain his gimmicky venture into the spring remains to be seen			0
but he has no shortage of product			0
" at this rate , it 's going to be july until the snow melts , " he told @entity41			0
" but i 've thought about taking this idea and running with it for other seasonal items			0
maybe i 'll ship some fall foliage			0
