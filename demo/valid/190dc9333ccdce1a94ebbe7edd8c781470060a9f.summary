the sack and pillage of the @entity3 museum by the so - called @entity4 and @entity5 displayed a violence rarely seen since the destruction of the @entity9 of @entity10			1
the bulldozing of the archaeological site of @entity13 marked a new step in the cultural cleansing underway in @entity16			1
these acts are a deliberate attack against civilians , minorities , heritage sites and traditions			1
in the minds of terrorists , murder and destruction of culture are inherently linked			1
it is appalling to see the ravages of this violent extremism in a region that is a cradle of civilization , whose temples , palaces and frescoes have born witness to the glory of @entity16 and @entity40 for the last 3,000 years			1
it is important we understand the true nature of this conflict			1
this war against culture is a war against people			1
it is part of a strategy to crush free thinking and to ensure domination through oppression			1
this is why extremists attack schools , media , or other places of culture			2
through modern methods of communication and information , they use warped learning and distorted academic texts to hijack young minds			2
they forbid girls to go to school , kill journalists and vandalize museums : all symbols that embody freedom of thought and respect for cultural diversity			2
there can be no justification whatsoever for the systematic destruction of the heritage of humanity , and i wholeheartedly support the many religious leaders who have taken such a firm position denouncing these destructions and the perverted use of religion			2
when culture is under attack , we must respond with more knowledge , and with ever greater effort to work to explain the importance of humanity 's shared heritage			2
this is why we appeal to all cultural institutions , museums , journalists , professors , and scientists to share knowledge widely about the @entity40 civilization			0
we need to remind ‎ all of the history of this land which led the @entity4 golden age			0
and we also call on all people everywhere -- and especially youth , in @entity16 and elsewhere -- to claim this heritage as their own			1
pre-islamic heritage in @entity16 belongs to all @entity16 , just as the @entity109 are written into the identity of all @entity111			1
what is happening goes far beyond the domain of archaeologists and discourse on the " irreparable loss of treasures of humanity			0
" what is happening is a security issue			0
the deliberate destruction of cultural heritage is a war crime			0
we see how terrorists are using such destruction to destabilize populations , spread terror , and encourage violence			0
we see also how extremists use heavy military vehicles to transport artifacts from looted ‎ sites , and how illicit trafficking is directly funding terrorism			0
with this in mind , we have joined forces with all partners and neighboring countries to halt these crimes			0
the acceleration of such violence must be met with an acceleration of global solidarity and action			0
faced with such crimes , we hope we can better understand the values we all share , and stand united in respect of humanity .			0
