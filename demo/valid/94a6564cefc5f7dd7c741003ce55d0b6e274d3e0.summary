@entity1 @entity0 said monday that investigators found no " substantive basis " to support a @entity6 female student 's story that she was raped at the @entity8 house , an account that @entity10 published last november			1
" @entity15 " told the magazine that in late september 2012 , she was assaulted at the house , the article said			1
police chief @entity16 noted that just because police found no evidence to support her account , " that does n't mean that something terrible did n't happen to @entity15 " on the day in question			1
@entity16 said he welcomed any information that might still be out there about the case			1
the @entity10 story generated controversy from the moment it came out , first sparking a debate about the prevalence of rape on college campuses throughout the country			2
but then the controversy turned toward the story 's content when apparent contradictions and discrepancies in the article came to light			2
@entity10 said it did not get the accounts of those accused in the piece , and apologized			2
editors vowed to conduct their own investigation , which is expected to be published in early april			2
@entity16 said @entity15 did not give police a statement during their investigation			1
@entity2 legal analyst @entity50 said it 's not unusual for a sexual assault victim to avoid the criminal process			2
" sometimes they ca n't deal with the probing that occurs			2
they do n't want to submit to a rape kit			2
they know that they will be scrutinized , quite frankly			2
so that in and of itself ... does n't make this young woman a liar , " she said			0
@entity50 pointed out that only about 2 % of rapes that are reported are false , and only about 40 % of rapes that occur are even reported : " so the suggestion that she just sort of made this entire thing up flies in the face of the statistics			1
" nine out of 11 people at the fraternity house at the time the sexual assault allegedly occurred talked to police , @entity16 said			1
none of them said they knew about a rape , he said , and investigators further determined that it was unlikely a party even happened at the fraternity house on the day in question as was alleged in the @entity10 story			0
the @entity10 reporter , @entity88 , talked to police , authorities said , but there were some questions she declined to answer for journalistic reasons			1
it 's unclear what those questions were			0
in total , authorities spoke to 70 people as part of their investigation , and just two believed that @entity15 was the victim of something , capt. @entity97 told @entity2 's " @entity104			0
" " the two of them were fairly convinced that something had happened -- not the way it was described , the way it was written			0
but they thought , again , that something had probably occurred , " he said			0
after the story 's publication , @entity6 suspended the fraternity 's activities , and outrage spread throughout campus as many struggled to comprehend the horrific experience that @entity15 said she endured			1
the article also suggested the school failed to respond to the alleged assault			1
@entity8 released a statement monday , saying the " discredited " story has done significant damage , while acknowledging the " importance of sexual assault issues on @entity126 's college campuses			0
" the fraternity asked @entity10 to " fully and unconditionally retract its story			0
" @entity10 editors said they chose not to contact the man who allegedly orchestrated the attack on @entity15 , or any of the men she said participated in her alleged assault , " because the editors feared retaliation against her , " the magazine said , adding that it regretted that decision			0
" in the face of new information , there now appear to be discrepancies in @entity15 's account , and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced , " @entity10 said in december			0
@entity10 managing editor @entity149 later tweeted that " the truth would have been better served by getting the other side of the story			0
" @entity10 issued an apology for discrepancies in its article and began to fact - check it			0
@entity158 , dean of the @entity159 , has been leading the independent review , @entity2 senior media correspondent @entity157 reported sunday			1
@entity157 said there has been much speculation about @entity158 's findings			0
@entity159 's review will be published in early april in the magazine			1
" i ca n't really say i 'm surprised since so much of the evidence was already called into question , " a former friend of @entity15 's said in response to what police found			1
" i think it 's great that they 're staying open to considering any new evidence that comes up			1
" @entity175 added : " i 've resigned myself to realize that i might never know what did or did n't happen			0
" @entity2 's @entity177 and @entity178 contributed to this report .			0

police : no evidence found to support claims made by @entity6 student that she was raped
an independent review by a journalism school dean is *underway*
