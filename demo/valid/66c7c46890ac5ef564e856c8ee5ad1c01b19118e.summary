welcome to the world of boxing promotion , circa 2015			0
@entity18 @entity17 and @entity20 @entity19 are set to officially announce their heavily anticipated boxing match at a press conference in @entity24 wednesday			1
with the combined purse for the may 2 bout in @entity27 reported to touch $ 300 million pending viewership numbers , the incentives to self - promote could not be higher			2
" nowadays you have to be on social media to launch the fight and to build hype , " says boxing promoter @entity30 , ceo of @entity31			1
" it could n't be done without it			0
" thirty - eight year old @entity17 ( 47 - 0 , 26 knockouts ) , who favors the moniker " @entity41 " or " @entity42 " ( @entity43 ) , boasts nearly five million @entity1 followers , 5.65 million followers on @entity46 and 9.2 million @entity47 likes			1
he famously confirmed the fight via shots , a photo sharing social media application that he 's invested in , and displays links to his clothing brand , @entity53 , on all his accounts			1
along with professing to the be the best fighter of all time , he could also stake a claim to be one of the greatest social media users in sports			1
" i think they 're both playing their roles , " says @entity30 , who promotes over 45 boxers			0
" you 've got the bad guy and the good guy , really			0
you 've got the guy who throws the money around ( @entity17 ) , that 's his image , and @entity19 , he 's the hope of a nation			1
" although @entity19 ( 57 - 5 - 2 , 38 knockouts ) also sports millions of followers , his social media numbers lag behind that of his opponent			1
the 36 - year - old @entity20 counts 1.7 million followers on @entity46 and just 647,000 on @entity1 , although his popularity on @entity47 is much closer , with 6.3 million page likes			2
has this disparity had an impact on @entity19 's share of the fight 's heady purse , which is reported to be split 60/40 in favor of @entity17 ? " if you have five million @entity46 followers it does give you power in negotiation , because it reflects popularity , " says @entity30			1
" but @entity17 needs @entity19 too ; you need a storyline to make a good fight ... ( @entity19 ) is the route to make it the biggest purse in history			1
" the disparity is probably due to @entity19 's less flashy posts			2
without exception , they show him in training , in church , or with family -- always with a nod to @entity109 in the text -- as well as his nationality , says sports media consultant @entity112 and @entity114 chief executive officer			0
" @entity19 is a little bit more of a private person ; he 's not going to be as outspoken and give away as much , so he 's always going to have a smaller following , " he says , while noting that @entity1 is less popular outside of @entity115 and @entity116			1
@entity19 's followers in his home country are more likely to track his moves on @entity47 and @entity46 , adds @entity123			0
either way , both fighters are likely to experience a surge in followers			0
" if the only place you can find out what 's happening behind the scenes in the lead - up to the fight is via their social media feeds , you 're going to follow them , " @entity112 says			1
" so i think they will see quite a big increase in followers and the amount of mentions they 're getting as the fight gets closer			0
" athletes who participate in individual sports are more inclined to be active on social media , says @entity112 , because they do n't receive regular salaries , and product endorsements can be a much larger portion of their income			2
" a boxer or a golfer or a tennis player has to use it as a commercial platform or a brand building platform , " he says			0
" if you have the choice between a different number of athletes to sponsor , and one has a million @entity1 followers while the other does n't go on social media , then it 's a no - brainer			1
" every fighter nowadays should be on social media , and if they 're not , then they 're not doing a good enough job at promoting themselves , " he says			2
" it does n't matter who you are , whether you 're a club fighter or a superstar			0
" " it 'll be an interesting fight , " adds @entity123 , " just because they are so different			0
