@entity2 fashion designer @entity0 and @entity4 are in a war of words on social media , calling for boycotts of each other 's work			1
the argument stems from comments about in - vitro fertilization in @entity14 , in which @entity15 and longtime collaborator @entity0 spoke about " synthetic " children born from " rented " wombs			1
" no chemical children : life has a natural course , there are things that should n't be modified , " the magazine says in a quote attributed to both designers			2
the magazine also promises insights from the designers on " the importance of relationships within conventional families with very , very traditional values " in an interview that hit @entity2 newsstands last week			2
@entity4 , who has two children with husband @entity36 through @entity37 , issued a strong repudiation of the statements on sunday and pledged to boycott the @entity0 fashion line			1
in response , @entity15 defended his " freedom to speak " and called on fans to boycott @entity4			1
sir @entity4 appears to be winning the social media war with the hashtag # @entity46 , which by monday morning had been used more than 35,000 times on @entity48 since @entity4 invoked it on sunday			1
by comparison , @entity15 's # boycotteltonjohn has been used just 1,600 times on @entity48 , according to social media search tool @entity52			1
" how dare you refer to my beautiful children as ' synthetic '			2
and shame on you for wagging your judgemental little fingers at @entity37 - a miracle that has allowed legions of loving people , both straight and gay , to fulfill their dream of having children , " @entity4 said sunday on @entity56			1
" your archaic thinking is out of step with the times , just like your fashions			0
i shall never wear @entity0 ever again			1
" the sentiment quickly gathered support from such celebrities as @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			0
tennis star @entity74 tweeted her support for @entity4 's post , saying " my @entity0 shirts are going in the bin â€” do n't want anyone to wear them			1
" parents and ivf advocates also joined the boycott			0
" my son is not synthetic			0
his life was made possible through # @entity37 & i could n't be more grateful , " writer and infertility advocate @entity84 said in a tweet			2
the comments from @entity0 struck some as hypocritical coming from a couple that was romantically involved until 2005 ( they continued working together after the breakup )			1
still , @entity15 has dropped hints in interviews of his " traditional " views toward family structure			0
he told an @entity2 publication in 2006 that he once asked a female friend to be a surrogate mother because he was " opposed to the idea of a child growing up with two gay parents			0
" gabbana was quick to react to this controversy , calling @entity4 a " fascist " in an @entity56 comment that was later deleted , according to @entity3 affiliate @entity106			1
he also sought to discredit reports that they told @entity14 in this instance they objected to same - sex adoption , even though @entity15 took that position in his 2006 interview			2
by sunday evening , @entity15 's @entity56 feed was full of screengrabs and reposts from people who supported his right to voice his opinion			0
" it 's a shame that you are not allowed to say what you like , " one person said in a comment on @entity15 's @entity56			0
" you have every right to say what you want , especially as you were n't disrespectful nor immature like @entity4 was			1
his comments are unnecessary , cheap and childish			2
" @entity15 issued a statement saying he and @entity0 had not intended to judge others			1
" we firmly believe in democracy and the fundamental principle of freedom of expression that upholds it			2
we talked about our way of seeing reality , but it was never our intention to judge other people 's choices , " the statement read			0
@entity0 also defended his views in statement and said he was not applying them to other people			1
" i 'm @entity143 and i grew up in a traditional family , made up of a mother , a father and children			0
i am very well aware of the fact that there are other types of families and they are as legitimate as the one i 've known			0
but in my personal experience , family had a different configuration ...			0
i was talking about my personal view , without judging other people 's choices and decisions , " the statement read			0
@entity3 's @entity161 contributed to this report .			0
