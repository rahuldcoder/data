this is what it 's come to			1
@entity3 asked its local baristas to have conversations about race			1
not the federal government or @entity8			1
not academia or the @entity9			1
but a national coffee shop chain waded into an area of social conflict that is as old as the slave ships and as modern as stop - and - frisk policing			1
@entity3 ceo @entity16 was accused of ruining that magic morning moment when customers fork over $ 4.15 for a " grande " coffee with warm skim milk and vanilla extract			1
a barista writing " @entity25 " on cups was called an affront to mornings and coffee -- such important conversations belonged inside a hallowed institution , not a common coffee shop , where apparently people no longer chat			1
a lot of the reaction came via snipes on @entity36 from people calling @entity38 out on @entity3 ' diversity , the hue of his mochaccinos , or his liberal " brewing " of controversy			1
the nastiness drove the company 's communications chief briefly off @entity36			1
then , after barely a week , @entity3 shut down the whole darned thing , pushing ahead with a hiring and media initiative instead			1
but treating @entity36 as an important voice of @entity52 conscience is like focusing on the annoying beep emitting from your smoke detector instead of addressing the fact that the battery 's run dry			1
what 's trending is not necessarily what matters			1
people do need to talk about race			1
not because of a harmless coffee cup , but because we have a real race problem and we need solutions			1
@entity67 just finished a nationwide tour of @entity52 colleges , universities and communities called " @entity72 2015			1
" it 's based on our @entity1 documentary series that takes a close look at the challenges and triumphs of being black in @entity52 : from the hopes of the @entity80 era to today 's unlikely brew of un-kept promises and vast opportunities			1
there were plenty of conversations about race among the thousands of black and white college students and panelists like rapper @entity90 and @entity91 of the @entity92			1
they lined up to talk about how their experiences mirrored those of the people in the documentaries : black families finding common roots with whites , the politics of skin color , or the black - and - blue conflict over the police engaging in racial profiling			1
the topics and perceptions were an unending thread			1
not only did people talk when they were offered the chance ; they wanted to talk			1
at @entity116 , one of our tour stops , a young white male student asked our panel if effecting change in racial discrimination today was even harder to achieve than it was during the @entity121 when racism was more overt			2
there are no longer signs segregating our bathrooms and water fountains , but police are being caught on cell phone videos in apparent attacks on young black men -- the new signposts of racial inequality			2
new technology has multiplied and spread symbols of racial injustice , but that has created new challenges and new reasons to talk			1
in this country we sometimes pretend we are so far past the ugly days of @entity141 and middle - of - the - night cross burnings as to have no racial issues to discuss			2
we did , after all , elect a black president who , like me , has both a black and a white parent and descends from immigrants			2
but blacks and whites do n't see things the same , and that is a big problem we need to discuss			2
@entity153 asked people of both races this year how much more needs to be done to achieve racial equality			2
seventy - nine percent of blacks said " a lot " more work needs to be done			2
just 44 % of whites thought the same			2
our country is more diverse than ever -- 13 % african - american and 17 % @entity162 , according to the @entity164 -- but we still live in different worlds			2
blacks have more debt , higher unemployment , less financial security , are less likely to be married or own homes , and are less likely to be represented in corporate boardrooms , the tech industry or even @entity8			2
perhaps more alarmingly , 75 % of black students are going to schools where the majority of the students look just like them			2
it has been 60 years since @entity178 was supposed to bring our schoolchildren together on an equal playing field			2
that is something worth talking about			0
recently , @entity183 , who founded the @entity184 in @entity185 , @entity186 , examined the details behind 3,959 lynchings in 12 @entity190 states from 1877 to 1950			0
he wants to raise money to memorialize the sites			0
we may not live in that land any more , though the @entity195 is investigating the death of a black man found hanging among the walnut trees this month in @entity199			0
but we do live in a land where there is a modern terror digging roots in the minds of young black men			0
in 2014 , our @entity1 documentary " @entity72 : @entity215 " showed police officers talking fearfully about facing off against young criminals on familiar streets and @entity211 - @entity52 men in fear that they would become the victims of police shootings			0
the documentary was released just as grand juries chose not to indict the police officers in the @entity219 and @entity220 , @entity221 , cases			0
to me , it reveals how damaging the rift in our perceptions can be			0
a young man named @entity228 talked about being frisked over 100 times			0
why ? " because i fit the description , " said the black college student			0
seventy percent of blacks believe , just like @entity228 , that the police treat racial and ethnic groups differently and do not hold police officers accountable for misconduct , according to a study by the @entity153			0
the percentage of whites who agree with that perception hovers in the mid- 30s			0
much of the white community does n't perceive or understand the persecution of a @entity228			0
but when they see a videotape , as in the @entity219 case , many finally recognize there is a problem			0
we need to consider how a lack of confidence in government and law enforcement is dangerous in a civil society			0
a young man named @entity255 shared a cell phone video with me when i was reporting " @entity215			0
" it shows tall white police officers beating @entity255 on the street for no apparent reason			0
he could n't call the police for help			0
what if there had been no tape , i asked him			0
" nobody would have believed me , " he said			0
" it would have been my word against 15 police officers			0
" that is modern - day terror , and worth at least a coffee shop chat			1
black people talk about race all the time , from processing comments about our freckles to recounting how someone rolls their fingers through our child 's curly hair			1
we do n't get or expect an even playing field at work			0
we do n't ever get to cross a street in a hoodie at night without the other pedestrians making a string of assumptions			0
we do n't have some mutable characteristic			0
we wake up and go to bed black , and that makes a difference in this country			0
ceo @entity16 was left wondering why it was such a bad idea to encourage people to talk about race			1
his initial letter to his staff made it clear he believes his # racetogether coffee cup campaign can contribute to starting an important conversation			1
" what if our customers ... had a renewed level of understanding and sensitivity about the issue , and they themselves would spread that to their own sphere of influence ? " what a good question it was			0

@entity3 *quickly* shut down its *program* of asking baristas to talk to the public about race
@entity325 : forget the storm of tweets *criticizing* the coffee company ; we need a *vigorous* conversation on race
