if it were easy , any company or government could do it			1
but flying an @entity4 patient halfway around the world -- while keeping that person alive , and everyone safe -- is complicated			1
probably no one knows that better than @entity11 , a @entity12 - based company that is the go - to for transporting @entity4 victims by air			1
since august , it has made approximately 40 trips -- about half to @entity16 , the rest to the @entity18			2
" we 're like a fire truck sitting in the firehouse			2
the bell goes off and within a matter of hours we can be out the door and underway , " said @entity22 , vice president and chief operations officer at @entity11			2
he described the system that goes inside the company 's modified @entity29 aircraft			1
it consists of three major elements : once the plane has landed and the patient has left , the whole system is sealed			2
the aircraft then flies to a high - security hanger in @entity38 , @entity12 , where it undergoes a complete decontamination process , which can take up to 24 hours			1
everything inside the liner , including the liner , is sterilized multiple times			2
the liner and everything in it is then removed , put in special boxes , and taken to a federally licensed incinerator where everything is destroyed			0
" we like to say it 's more sterile than the surface of the moon when we 're done with it , " @entity22 said			0
@entity11 began developing its system way before the current @entity4 outbreak			1
it worked with the @entity53 and the @entity54 to build a system that could safety transport patients with contagious diseases			1
then , the main concerns were @entity59 , swine and bird flu			1
it took years to work out the kinks and get the system approved , and by the time the work was done , the need had sort of petered out			0
but @entity22 said @entity11 held onto the system , knowing -- unfortunately -- the need would arise again			0
he got a call from the @entity68 in july			0
by august , the company had completed its first @entity4 flight , safely delivering dr. @entity71 to @entity72 in @entity73			1
a few days later , it brought @entity75 to the same hospital for treatment			0
and on and on and on			0
@entity22 said other groups are now developing systems similar to @entity11 's , including the @entity18 government			0
but so far , none has flown			0
" other organizations have built systems , but we 're the ones still doing it , " he said			0
more than 10,000 people have died in the @entity4 outbreak , mostly in the countries of @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 .			1
