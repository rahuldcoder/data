many years ago i performed at the @entity2 , in @entity3 , @entity4 , which was the last stop on @entity7 's final tour			1
he was killed in a plane crash in 1959 that also took the lives of singers j.p. " the @entity12 and @entity13			1
by this time , @entity7 and i had had a pretty long history together			1
the concert that i performed at had all the old members of his group			0
@entity18 , who @entity13 wrote a song about , was also there			2
@entity21 , who @entity7 sang about , was there too			2
the @entity23 were there -- they sang background vocals on @entity7 's records -- as well as singer @entity27 , who claimed that years later he got his wallet back from the crash site			1
unfortunately some fans at this show were selling crash - site photos , which i thought was in extremely bad taste			2
i think the prospect of the @entity36 delving into the crash again , which might mean exhuming bodies and all the rest , would be in similarly bad taste			1
i think there 's a reason we say , " rest in peace			1
" @entity7 would have the same stature musically whether he would have lived or died , because of his accomplishments which , in retrospect , nobody -- and i mean nobody , not the @entity49 the @entity50 or anyone else -- can beat , for these reasons : by the time he was 22 years old he had recorded some 50 tracks , most of which he had written himself and each of them , in my view and the view of many others , a hit			2
@entity61 were the template for all the rock bands that followed			0
@entity64 can touch songs like " @entity66 , " " think it over , " " @entity67 , " " @entity21 " and many , many more			0
he was also a sensitive , ballad composer and singer , which people often overlook , with songs like " @entity73 " and " @entity74 , " among many			0
as a paperboy , i cut open the stack of papers on february 3 , 1959 , and saw that @entity7 had been killed in the plane crash			1
the next day i went to school in shock , and guess what ? nobody cared			0
@entity83 in those days was sort of like hula hoops and @entity7 had n't had a big hit on the charts since ' 57 , nor had the others in the plane crash			1
@entity89 in those days were always looking ahead			2
@entity90 was not lingered over			0
we 'd had enough of that in @entity90 and grief did not go with the exuberance and bright colors of the 1950s			0
since then we have embarked on what i would call the " @entity89 death trip			1
" one simply has to look at the slew of autopsy shows on television and the endless regurgitation of @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity107 death details to get my point			0
furthermore , because of the ever - growing psychological power of the media , we seem to think we can reach back half a century and touch things as if they are real			0
we live in a virtual nostalgic world because of this			0
fortunately , @entity7 's music is forever young and all any young person has to do is listen to it and his life will be changed forever .			1

@entity119 : it 's bad idea for @entity36 to *re-examine* 1959 crash that killed @entity7 , " @entity123 , " @entity13
he says it 's *distasteful* ; they should " rest in peace "
he says looking at crash case again is only part of the " @entity89 death trip " that *pervades* our *culture*
