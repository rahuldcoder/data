as more details about the infamous @entity4 executioner " @entity3 " become known , certain basic questions continue to be raised			1
is @entity5 as a faith to be blamed for @entity8 's voyage to @entity4 , otherwise known as the @entity9 ? or is the " @entity13 " responsible , and is this merely " chickens coming home to roost ? " the temptation is to come to simplistic answers			1
confronted with such brazen depravity as shown in @entity4 propaganda videos , many take what their propagandists say very seriously : that they are , indeed , doing what their faith tells them to do			1
on the other hand , few believed @entity4 when it was claimed they would negotiate with the @entity27 authorities to release one of their citizens captured in @entity30 , who was later killed			1
taking @entity4 at their word is probably not the most sensible course of action -- it is obviously quite wrong -- and duplicitous -- about a number of things			1
there have been other neo-religious movements in both @entity39 and @entity41 history			2
the " assassins , " for example , which began in the 11th century , was a radical , heterodox movement of @entity39 , which eventually died out -- in its own time , similar to @entity4 today , it was decried and depicted as deviant by @entity39 religious authorities as well as most @entity39			1
among @entity53 , many of the @entity52 leadership in the 20th century espoused an ideology called " @entity55			2
" it obviously never attracted much of a following , and historians claim , " only a few radicals on the extreme wing of liberal @entity61 would recognize such a mish - mash as true @entity55			2
" why , then , are we not prepared to expunge @entity5 from the mix when interrogating @entity4 ideology ? while most churches , @entity61 and @entity67 , rejected the " @entity55 " of @entity52 , there is no corresponding action from the world of @entity5			1
the problem is , that 's not entirely possible			2
unlike @entity53 , @entity5 does not admit a hierarchical , ecclesiastical authority -- so , no " @entity73 " or " @entity74 " exists			2
having said that , nevertheless , there are systems of religious authority in @entity5			0
they are more akin to academic peer review structures -- indeed , the concept of the modern university comes from the medieval @entity39 seminary			0
since the dawn of @entity4 , numerous @entity39 religious authorities have denounced the claim to authenticity by @entity4 , on religious grounds -- none have given it that prize of legitimacy it so craves			1
that is , except for @entity4 itself , and for some odd reason , some in the @entity97 who insist on taking @entity4 at its word			1
religious authorities at large , and @entity39 in general , may recognize @entity4 members as @entity39 , albeit gravely deviant ones who ought to be treated as criminals			1
just as @entity106 en masse rejected the claims of @entity108 , the @entity109 mass killer , who claimed " @entity55 " as a motivator , without denying he considered himself to be a @entity41			0
in both cases , it is important to understand how this ideology is internally justified , and on what basis , particularly in terms of establishing methods for immunizing vulnerable people from possible recruitment strategies			0
that does n't , nevertheless , entail recognizing their claims as accurate -- only that they take them seriously , and others may too			0
that question of " vulnerability " has also been brought up a great deal in the last couple of weeks			0
there were some in the @entity131 who argued that @entity3 was subjected to a type of harassment by the @entity131 security services that proved to be a causal factor in his radicalization process			0
in one interview , the lobby group , @entity140 , insisted in response to a question about responsibility for the beheadings in @entity30 : " the man who cut off their heads , and if you take that back a step , the people who potentially helped in his radicalization ; in this case , the security services			1
" specialists in the field of radicalization took great exception to the implication , with experts from the likes of @entity163 and @entity164 describing it as " absurd , " and " bizarre			0
" certainly , there are questions to be raised with regards to the @entity131 security services -- including how @entity3 , who was known to them , was allowed to leave the country , as well as how suspects are interrogated and questioned			0
there should n't be any sensitivity about this -- the @entity131 security services do the job that they do precisely so @entity131 live in a society open enough to be able to ask these questions without fear or reprisal			0
nevertheless , the suggestion that the @entity131 security services somehow radicalized @entity3 is peculiar			0
there are many high - profile members of @entity4 in @entity30 and @entity183 who underwent no harassment of any sort -- for example , @entity188 , a youth leader in a @entity190 political party			1
there are also many who have undergone far more invasive encounters with other security establishments worldwide , at the hands of authoritarian governments in the @entity198 world and elsewhere -- they did not suddenly register for service in the @entity4 stronghold of @entity202			2
does it make them more vulnerable to possible recruitment ? it very well could -- but that 's not a foregone conclusion			2
otherwise , given the scale of autocratic oppression in recent history , we should have seen far more members of @entity4			2
there will be those who contend radical @entity217 theology is all we need to look at in understanding radicalization -- there will be others who will place all attention on domestic issues such as the security services , or foreign policy			0
the reality is , however , there is no template for explaining the voyage an individual takes in becoming a member of @entity4 or any other radical @entity217 group			1
for different individuals , different factors make them vulnerable to recruitment			0
more often than not , a recruit will find him or herself looking for some kind of " meaning " in this world -- and repugnant though @entity4 ideology may be , it does provide a sense of certainty			1
what makes recruits more attuned to that kind of absolutism as opposed to going down other paths ? it may be many things that condition them before they accept radical @entity217 as their " savior			0
" in all cases , nevertheless , there are two things we ought to keep foremost in mind			0
we must understand the context of the paths these recruits go through , to avoid others doing the same -- and we must always keep in mind that regardless of the context , only one person has responsibility for their actions			1
each one of them , themselves .			0

@entity272 : there is no template for explaining an individual 's *journey* to a group like @entity4
often a recruit will find themselves looking for " meaning " and @entity4 provides certainty , says @entity272
he adds : regardless of context , each individual must take responsibility for their own actions
