@entity1 the @entity0 is preparing to bring criminal corruption charges against sen. @entity4 , a @entity6 @entity5 , alleging he used his @entity8 office to push the business interests of a @entity11 donor and friend in exchange for gifts			1
people briefed on the case say attorney general @entity17 has signed off on prosecutors ' request to proceed with charges , @entity2 first reported			1
an announcement could come within weeks			1
prosecutors are under pressure in part because of the statute of limitation on some of the allegations			1
@entity4 told reporters friday night he has " always conducted myself appropriately and in accordance with the law			1
" he added : " and i am not going anywhere			1
" @entity4 said that because of an ongoing investigation he could n't answer questions at the news conference , held in @entity36			1
the case could pose a high - profile test of the @entity0 's ability to prosecute sitting lawmakers , having already spawned a legal battle over whether key evidence the government has gathered is protected by the @entity46 's @entity45 clause			1
the @entity47 and prosecutors from the @entity0 's public integrity section , have pursued a variety of allegations against @entity4 , who has called the probe part of " smear campaign " against him			1
the government 's case centers on @entity4 's relationship with @entity57 , a @entity58 ophthalmologist who the senator has called a friend and political supporter			1
@entity57 and his family have been generous donors to the senator and various committees the senator is associated with			1
related : @entity47 agents search office of @entity58 doctor known as @entity71 's donor investigators have focused in part on plane trips @entity4 took in 2010 to the @entity75 as a guest of @entity57			1
in 2013 , after word of the federal investigation became public , @entity4 paid back melgen $ 58,000 for the 2010 plane trips calling his failure to properly disclose the flights an " oversight			1
" @entity4 said he has been friends with @entity57 for more than 20 years and the two families have spent holidays and other special occasions together			1
one of the highest ranking @entity88 members of @entity89 , @entity4 is a former chairman of the @entity90			1
he has become one of the @entity94 administration 's most vocal @entity11 opponents on two key foreign policy matters -- president @entity94 's decision to ease the trade embargo against @entity98 and also his effort to engage direct negotiations with @entity101 over that country 's nuclear program			2
@entity4 advocated on @entity57 's behalf with federal @entity106 administrators who accused @entity57 of overbilling the government 's healthcare program , according to court documents and people briefed on the probe			2
@entity57 was among the top recipients of @entity106 reimbursements in recent years , during a time when he was also a major @entity11 donor			2
@entity57 's attorneys have denied any wrongdoing			2
prosecutors also are focusing on whether @entity4 broke the law in advocating for @entity57 's business interest in a @entity75 government contract for a port screening equipment			2
the @entity124 agency , at the time , considered donating port screening equipment to the @entity75 , which would have hurt the contract of @entity57 - controlled company			2
@entity4 , now serving his second full term as senator , led the @entity130 from 2009 - 2011			2
during a @entity8 subcommittee hearing in 2012 , @entity4 did n't mention @entity132 , @entity57 's company , by name , but he did press deputy assistant secretary of state @entity134 about an unnamed company who had a contract to x-ray cargo that went through all @entity75 ports -- a contract that , he said , @entity75 authorities " do n't want to live by			2
" " if those countries can get away with that , they will , " the senator said			0
" and that puts @entity148 companies at a tremendous disadvantage			0
" @entity4 's office said at the time the senator 's interest was based on his efforts to combat narcotrafficking in the region			0
other lines of inquiry against @entity4 had included allegations he solicited prostitutes in the @entity75 , and that he violated the law helping win permanent @entity148 residency for two @entity163 banking magnates , the @entity165 brothers			0
the prostitution allegations collapsed after the purported prostitutes recanted their story , and the @entity47 did n't find evidence of wrongdoing in the @entity165 matter , according to people briefed on the probe			0
the @entity47 probe has already spawned a legal battle between the government , @entity4 and his former aides			0
last week , the @entity178 briefly posted , apparently by accident , documents detailing legal efforts to block certain evidence and testimony the government wants to use			0
the documents were quickly put back under seal , but not before a reporter with the @entity187 secured a copy and later published a story			0
according to the documents , @entity4 's lawyers have sought to claim emails and testimony from aides is protected by the constitutional protections given to members of @entity89 in carrying out their duties			0
the speech and debate clause prohibits questioning of members of @entity89 about " legislative acts or the motivation for legislative acts			0
" the fight centers in part on the @entity0 's attempt to compel testimony from @entity4 's aides , some of whom have refused to answer questions to a grand jury			1
according to the documents , the government wants to question aides about a series of 2012 calls and meetings on @entity57 's fight with the @entity220 , a federal agency			0
among these is a meeting among @entity223 , sen. @entity224 and then @entity226 secretary @entity225			0
the government is also pushing to use emails between @entity4 's office and a @entity124 official about the @entity75 ports issue			0
a federal district court ruled in favor of the government to compel testimony from @entity4 's aides , but the appeals court reversed the ruling and ordered a hearing			0
" the parties primarily dispute the legislative character of senator @entity4 's two conversations with [ then acting @entity241 administrator @entity240 and his meeting with @entity243 , " the appeals court said			0
" these communications are not manifestly legislative acts because they are informal communications with executive branch officials , one of whom was at the time a presidential nominee whose nomination was pending before the @entity148 senate			0

an announcement from the @entity0 could come in weeks
case will be a test of ability to prosecute sitting lawmakers
