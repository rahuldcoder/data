@entity67 had to be alert to clear as @entity11 's @entity69 striker @entity68 -- starting for the first time since collapsing on the pitch at @entity72 earlier this month -- headed at goal			1

just before halftime @entity82 , a former @entity5 player , went close with a shot from a right wing corner that was deflected wide by @entity86			0
but having had a chance to regroup , @entity5 came out galvanized after the break and were soon on the front foot			0
@entity90 made a brilliant save to keep out @entity92 's near post effort before the @entity93 was then in action again to deny @entity95			0
though @entity5 were in the ascendency , its opening goal was down to a stroke of luck			2
as @entity23 galloped onto a through ball @entity11 's @entity101 defender @entity28 got there first , but his clearance ricocheted off the @entity5 player and into the net past @entity65			1
