there are two main ways visitors to @entity3 cross the streets			1
one approach is to step with zen - like calm into the swirl of honking scooters and serenely stride across the road without breaking step			0
like locals , they 're part of the flow , part of the ( exhaust - choked ) stream of traffic			0
the other is to stand anxiously on the edge of the curb , toes curled like a diver 's , waiting for a non-existent stoplight , then plunge into the melee while letting out a small yelp before slaloming across the street like a demented @entity26			0
some , like @entity27 , would question why cross the road at all			2
if you ca n't beat them , join them			0
which is what the @entity33 did -- he now runs the city 's @entity36			2
it 's a tour company that provides two - wheel thrills on the @entity41 vintage scooters , @entity42 , around @entity3 , out into the @entity43 and beyond			1
being on a scooter in @entity3 is the best way to feel a part of the city , says @entity27			1
" it 's really an authentic experience , " he says			0
" being side by side with the locals			2
" day tours take in popular sights like the @entity55 and central post office designed by @entity57 , but also stop at local eateries and offbeat locations			2
one popular early morning pit stop is @entity62 park where @entity3 's bird fanciers puff themselves up like their caged pets in a display of tweeting one - upmanship			1
unfortunately / thankfully , you 're not the one driving			0
all the mopeds are driven by local , experienced drivers who have no problem with the swarm of vehicles on the roads			1
a local tour guide rides along , too , to add context to the sights , smells and sounds experienced from the back of a two - stroke motor			1
@entity27 took a circuitous route to setting up the company			2
after traveling around @entity82 in 1997 he settled in @entity83 the following year and discovered a glut of classic @entity41 scooters that needed a bit of @entity87			0
he bought his first one after just three days in the country and spying an opportunity to tap into international @entity42 enthusiasts ' desire for authentic rides , set up a restoration and export business			0
it became so successful he was in danger of putting himself out of a job , so in 2006 he decided to start a tour company offering multi-day tours outside of @entity3			1
according to @entity27 , his business was kick - started by @entity83 's appearance on the tv program " @entity106 , " which showed the country 's beautiful countryside and underused roads			1
longer trips are still offered by @entity108 , taking willing riders as far as the @entity110 and the coastal city of @entity112 over seven days			0
most of the scooters in @entity27 's garage hark back to the golden age of @entity117 , the late ' 60s and 1970s , refurbished with replacement parts from @entity120 - licensed machinists in @entity121			1
true to their reputation , the 100 or so classic scooters owned by @entity36 break down frequently -- mechanics are on hand for running repairs -- but @entity27 believes its all part of the charm in a city where two wheels beats two legs			1
@entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity3 , @entity83 ; +84 12 2299 3585 / +84 9 3850 0997			0

@entity137 @entity27 started a tour company in @entity3 offering tours on @entity42
@entity27 says it 's the best way to see the city and beyond , riding side by side with locals
scooters are driven by experienced local drivers with tour guide and mechanic accompanying each tour
