then the sounds of a commercial jetliner slamming into the mountainside			0
that much is known about the final few minutes for the 144 passengers on @entity10 9525			1
beyond that , it 's a matter of imagination and speculation -- about what they saw and what they felt as their plane approached and then crashed into the @entity20			1
none of them can speak for themselves , nor can any of the flight 's six crew members			1
but authorities have given some clues , based on what investigators know about the aircraft 's trajectory and what they 've heard on a mangled cockpit voice recorder recovered at the crash site			1
it all began on what seemed like most any other tuesday as citizens of 18 countries packed into the @entity10 plane in @entity40 , @entity41			1
the passengers came from all walks of life , using @entity46 's low - cost carrier to get to @entity47 , @entity48			1
they were high school students , heading home after a week in @entity41			1
they were parents and children enjoying their vacation			0
there were businessmen , scouting out store locations			0
there was a 26 - minute delay before takeoff because air traffic controllers did n't give the ok to start the plane 's engines earlier and there was a small wait in the takeoff rotation , according to @entity46			1
for any frequent flier , that kind of delay is nothing abnormal			1
nor , it seems , was takeoff			0
the @entity70 left and headed northeast at 10:01 a.m. ( 5:01 a.m. et ) on what should have been a 726 - mile journey			0
the plane leveled off at 38,000 feet , its cruising altitude			1
by this point , passengers would be ok to unbuckle , head to the restroom or get their bags out of the overhead bin			0
a seemingly innocuous act changed everything : the aircraft 's pilot had to use the restroom , according to @entity46 ceo @entity86 , telling the co-pilot that he was stepping out			1
it 's possible that passengers saw the captain in the cabin , going to or from the restroom			1
they also could have noticed that the aircraft was going down -- even though they were about a half - hour into a nearly two - hour flight , with the @entity20 ahead of them			1
the passengers could n't have known it , but the co-pilot -- identified as 28 - year - old @entity105 -- " manipulated the buttons of the flight monitoring system to activate the descent of the aircraft " while the pilot was out , @entity97 prosecutor @entity96 said thursday			0
this was around 10:45 a.m. it was n't like the plane suddenly jerked down , plunging straight into the ground			1
authorities described a steady descent at a rate of about 3,000 to 3,500 feet ( or roughly 1,000 meters ) per minute			2
still , it is the kind of descent you 'd expect while nearing an airport -- not traversing the @entity20			1
if passengers did n't notice that fall , they might have caught wind of what was happening at the front of the plane			2
students , singers among the victims inside the cockpit , the only sound was that of @entity105 breathing steadily			2
but outside the cockpit , the noises apparently grew louder and more frantic			0
the pilot tried to open the door but could n't get in			0
he likely knocked on the door			0
he used a video conference system to talk to the co-pilot , @entity96 said			0
nor did his last - ditch attempt , as recounted by a senior @entity139 military official involved in the crash investigation to the @entity141			2
" you can hear he is trying to smash the door down , " the official said			0
did the passengers hear this commotion upfront ? it 's hard to imagine they did n't			2
and if that was n't reason enough to cause worry , they just had to look outside -- at the mountain chain that should have been far below them instead of getting closer and closer and closer			0
the voice recorder did n't indicate any abnormal noise in the cabin until the final few moments			2
still , even if the passengers did n't know it at the time , all it took was eight minutes for a seemingly normal flight to become a nightmare			2
the nightmare ended in a violent crash into rugged , remote terrain			0
so did the screams and the lives of all 150 people on @entity170 -- a death that @entity96 described as " instantaneous			0
" who was co-pilot @entity105 ?			0

@entity174 had a slight delay before taking off from @entity40 , @entity41
after leveling off at 38,000 feet , the plane descended steadily before hitting the @entity20
screams were heard in plane 's cabin in minutes before crash , according to audio recording
