the @entity1 has demonstrated a pattern of racial discrimination , the @entity0 said wednesday			0
but while some experts say the numbers alone tell only part of the story , the 102 - page report merely reaffirmed many residents ' beliefs			1
in @entity13 , just over 67 % of residents are black			1
but among the findings , the report shows that 85 % of traffic stops , 90 % of citations , 93 % of arrests and 88 % of use - of - force incidents involved african - americans , the @entity0 said			2
@entity22 @entity21 said the police department 's behavior amounted to " taxation by citation			2
" he told @entity2 the arrests affected not just @entity13 residents but also residents of nearby communities who pass through @entity13 en route to other locales in the area			1
@entity0 : no @entity35 charges the statistics sound damning , but former @entity38 police chief @entity37 , who dealt with the @entity0 during his five - year tenure as chief , said , " the numbers can be deceiving because the population is overwhelmingly black			1
" the numbers alone do n't paint the full picture , he said , explaining that he 'd need more than mere statistics about each stop to draw solid conclusions			1
read the report @entity37 served as chief in @entity38 from 1997 to 2002 , and after the @entity0 determined in 2000 that the @entity50 had engaged " in a pattern or practice of excessive force , false arrests and unreasonable searches and seizures , " he had to overhaul the department , combating corruption and even jailing former police officers			2
based on that experience , @entity37 said the report released wednesday should n't be taken at face value , but rather should be used to help determine " what is really going on in @entity13 and what to do to correct it			1
" politics may even be at play , @entity38 - based community activist @entity66 suggested			0
attorney general @entity69 wanted to bring civil rights cases against @entity13 officer @entity35 , who killed @entity71 in august , and @entity72 neighborhood watch volunteer @entity73 , who killed @entity74 in 2012 -- but neither case panned out			1
the report may be @entity69 's way to " extract a pound of flesh , if you will , from the @entity1			1
" ( also wednesday , the @entity0 closed its investigation into @entity35 , declining to bring criminal charges against him			0
) still , the report likely did n't surprise some residents who spoke to @entity2 in august , during the height of the protests			1
@entity87 , 41 , a nurse who lives a few blocks from where @entity71 took his last steps , said older and female @entity93 - @entity92 residents are n't affected as much , but her sons -- ages 17 , 19 and 21 -- have had different experiences			1
they and other young black men have been stopped for reasons as spurious as looking suspicious , she said			2
" how does a person look suspicious ? what do you have to be wearing to look suspicious ? " she asked before mimicking an offending police officer 's questions : " ' where you going ? what you doing ? how you doing it ? ' it 's none of your business			2
" outside his bustling barbershop , @entity109 recalled how one of his sons , an a student , was arrested with several other kids in the parking lot of an auto parts store			0
they 'd met there because it was a central location to rendezvous before a game of basketball			0
when @entity109 , 33 , picked his son up , police told him he had n't been charged , just taken away by police , he said			2
the father of four said he himself had been pulled over for @entity127 , or " driving while black , " a common complaint among african - americans in @entity13			1
@entity130 , 22 , a @entity13 resident of eight years , relayed a similar story : a @entity13 officer once pulled him over and said he was looking for a suspect with dreadlocks			2
" and i got a box cut , " he said , pointing to his dyed - blond ' do			0
being a lifelong resident of the @entity22 area , @entity109 knows @entity13 well			2
when he was a kid , @entity22 police walked the streets and handed kids @entity142 baseball cards , so he 's seen real community - oriented policing			0
but there 's a rift between the community and police in @entity13 -- as well as in surrounding areas such as @entity149 and @entity150 , he said			1
" they all do it			0
people are just tired of that happening			0
why should we get pulled over every time we get in the car ? " he said , adding that he struggles with what to tell his kids			0
" you do n't want to tell them the police are bad			0
i tell them , ' keep it moving , ' " he said			0
" if you let your attitude take over , that can be you laying on that ground			0
" even white residents have complained of run - ins with police			2
@entity170 , 31 , who has lived in @entity13 since 1994 , said @entity13 has always been a diverse town , and race is n't much of a factor among residents			1
" it 's always diverse , but they always got along , " he said			0
but the police ? " they all got a power trip problem , a lot of them , " he said			0
following wednesday 's announcement , @entity71 's parents , @entity182 and @entity71 , released a statement saying they were disappointed that @entity35 would not face federal charges in their son 's death			1
but the report on the police department could provide a silver lining			0
" we are encouraged that the @entity0 will hold the @entity1 accountable for the pattern of racial bias and profiling they found in their handling of interactions with people of color , " the statement said			0
" it is our hope that through this action , true change will come not only in @entity13 , but around the country			1
if that change happens , our son 's death will not have been in vain			1

@entity71 's parents say son 's death not in vain if report *prompts* change
some experts warn the numbers alone do n't show what 's happening in @entity13
several residents have complained of being stopped for @entity127 , driving while black
