@entity1 thankfully , no one was wounded after crude bombs were hurled at a @entity5 news station in @entity6 on thursday			1
but the loud explosions injured a vital part of the world 's largest democracy : free speech			2
last week , when @entity6 's government and a @entity14 documentarian faced off over a film featuring a man imprisoned for a 2012 gang rape in @entity18 , a little - known channel hundreds of miles away in southern @entity6 was waging its own battle			1
hardline @entity22 groups were angry with broadcaster @entity23 for filming a show about the relevance of a traditional necklace -- called mangalsutra in @entity29 and thaali in @entity5 -- worn by married @entity6 women			1
for them , the contents , as shown in the promos , were offensive to @entity22 culture			2
the station planned to release the program sunday , @entity37			2
but it canceled the telecast after demonstrations took place outside its office			0
protesters allegedly attacked one of its cameramen			0
four days later , the channel came under fire again , when four men on two motorbikes threw bombs into its compound in a predawn attack , authorities say			0
six people involved in the bombing have been arrested , said @entity57 , the commissioner of the southern @entity6 city of @entity59			1
their leader turned himself in separately , claiming responsibility for the attack , police said			0
" the show wanted to give women a platform			1
we welcome all opinions and thoughts			0
but you can not strangle freedom of free expression by violent means and threats , " said @entity70 , the ceo of @entity71 , which runs @entity23			1
" we condemn the attack in the strongest possible terms , " he told @entity2			0
' @entity6 's daughter , ' the film banned by @entity6 : what did it show ? but @entity6 is no stranger to censorship imposed legally or forced by rowdy protesters			1
the country 's constitution guarantees freedom of expression , but not without restrictions			2
communities or people claiming their religious sentiments were hurt by anyone else 's opinion can file a lawsuit			1
authorities can seek restraining orders from local courts -- as they did to ban the recent @entity100 documentary " @entity6 's daughter " -- by citing potential disorder			1
earlier last year , @entity103 withdrew " the @entity104 : an @entity105 , " a book by @entity108 academic @entity107 , after a local advocacy group accused the writer of denigrating @entity22			0
in december , a @entity112 movie , " pk , " came under attack over similar accusations when mobs tore apart its posters in parts of @entity6			1
a satire on religious rituals , " pk " became a roaring success by being one of the country 's highest - grossing movies			2
but @entity6 , home to one of the world 's largest film industries , has blocked several movies from screening			1
at least two films were not allowed last year			0
one of them featured the lives of the @entity133 assassins of prime minister @entity134 , and the other centered on the violence in @entity137 in the closing months of its civil war			0
hounded by protests over his novel , @entity142 , a @entity5 author , announced quitting writing in a dramatic post on @entity145 in january			2
" @entity142 , the writer is dead			0
as he is no @entity147 , he is not going to resurrect himself			0
he has no faith in rebirth			0
as an ordinary teacher , he will live as @entity151			0
leave him alone , " he said on @entity145 two months ago			0
religious and caste - based organizations had slammed his novel " @entity156 , " which depicted a childless wife taking part in an ancient festival allowing consensual sex between strangers			0
just last week , @entity6 blocked the @entity100 from airing " @entity6 's daughter " because it included comments from one of the men convicted of raping a young student in a moving bus in @entity1 in 2012			1
the reason : the inmate 's views could create unrest			2
" there 's a growing intolerance towards different shades of opinion			1
it 's a medieval mindset			2
what @entity6 needs is a concerted effort to move beyond it and embrace free expression in totality , " said @entity70 , the @entity71 chief executive .			1

@entity6 broadcaster @entity23 drew protests for a show about traditional necklaces worn by married women
this comes after @entity6 banned a film featuring a man imprisoned for a gang rape in @entity18
" there 's a growing intolerance towards different shades of opinion , " a broadcasting company ceo says
