even with the national chapter shutting the @entity3 house at the @entity4 , the school president said the university 's affiliation with the fraternity is permanently done as a campus group called for the expulsion of fraternity members			1
the members have until midnight tuesday to get their things out of the house , university president @entity12 said in a monday afternoon news conference			1
" the house will be closed , and as far as i 'm concerned , they wo n't be back , " he said , adding that the university is exploring what actions it can take against individual fraternity members			1
a saturday video showing party - bound fraternity members on a bus chanting a racial epithet found its way anonymously to the school newspaper and a campus organization , which both promptly publicized the nine - second clip			1
@entity12 : not just another college president the students on the bus clap and pump their fists as they boisterously chant , " there will never be a ni * * * * @entity3			2
you can hang him from a tree , but he can never sign with me			2
" by sunday night , @entity3 's national chapter had suspended the @entity4 members and threatened lifelong suspensions for anyone responsible for the chant , but @entity12 took it a step further			1
he appeared at a campus rally and told students over a bullhorn , " i have a message for those who have misused their freedom of speech in this way			2
my message to them is : you 're disgraceful			2
you have violated every principle that this university stands for			2
" he said that he was angered , outraged and saddened by what he saw in the video			2
@entity12 stressed that the fraternity members ' behavior is not indicative of what @entity4 students , nicknamed @entity65 , represent			1
" it was unbelievable that this could have possibly occurred with @entity4 students , " he said			0
" @entity65 are not racists			1
they are people who respect each other and care about each other			0
" he called for zero tolerance			0
" the only way you put a stop to it is have zero tolerance when it is found out			0
clearly , i think some of our students wanted this exposed			0
they wanted this video out there , and i 've asked them to please let me know when they 're other things like this that happen , " @entity12 told @entity5			1
the student newspaper , the @entity89 , received the video in a sunday email , said print editor @entity92			0
the fraternity celebrated its founder 's day on saturday , and the video showed members traveling to a formal event that evening , she said			2
" we decided that this was definitely a story they needed to cover without question , " she told @entity5			1
" this was something that we knew would n't be tolerated by the students at @entity4 and the university at large			2
" @entity106 , a campus organization launched in response to the police shooting of @entity111 in @entity112 , @entity113 , received the video sunday via anonymous text and immediately moved to " let our community and our university know that this behavior is not tolerated , that 's it 's unacceptable and it 's extremely , extremely offensive , " said the group 's co-director , @entity119			2
this mentality is not new to campus , and it 's not confined to one fraternity , @entity121 told @entity5 , but it 's the first time people have been caught on video			1
" unfortunately , it took them getting caught on video camera for this to happen , but this is definitely not something that is brand - new			0
it 's not something that 's only seen within this one organization , " she said			0
@entity121 said the only acceptable response is to expel -- not suspend , as that would send the wrong message -- all the students involved			0
" i was hurt that my fellow peers that i walk to class with every day , people that i see every day , could say such hateful things about me and my culture , about my friends , about my brothers and my sisters , " she said			0
at a news conference , @entity12 said the school was looking into punishing the individuals involved , especially against those " who have taken a lead " in the chanting			2
while expulsion is an option , any punishment must be " carefully directed " if it 's to pass constitutional muster			0
one key will be whether the offending students created a hostile environment on campus , he said			0
@entity12 emphasized that " there is no room for racists and bigots " at @entity4			1
" i think some of the students themselves may take themselves off the campus , and i hope they do because this is not a place that wants racists , " he told @entity5 later			1
that sentiment echoed throughout campus , as a large crowd of students attended a protest at the university 's @entity174 , some of them arriving with tape over their mouths with the word , " @entity106 , " written across it			2
other students took to social media to express their disappointment , with one person urging students to change their profile picture to an image that says in @entity189 crimson , " not on our campus , " the " ou " in " our " offset in gray			0
@entity4 is shorthand for the @entity4			0
@entity106 posted the video online sunday with the comment , " racism is alive at the @entity4			0
" it was addressed to @ @entity198 , the university president 's @entity196 handle			1
@entity12 quickly threatened to throw the fraternity off - campus if the allegations were true			1
the @entity3 's national chapter also moved promptly , saying in a statement it had closed the chapter " following the discovery of an inappropriate video			1
" the group further apologized for the " unacceptable and racist behavior of the individuals in the video			0
" " i was not only shocked and disappointed , but disgusted by the outright display of racism displayed in the video , " @entity3 national president @entity212 said in a statement			1
a group of students gathered to pray over the racist insults			0
one of them told @entity5 affiliate @entity221 he was " nauseated , frustrated , " but he was happy with the @entity3 headquarters ' decision			1
" we should be past this			0
this is disgusting , " he said			0
spray paint marked a wall of @entity3 's fraternity house at the university			1
" tear it down , " the graffiti appeared to say			0
police posted squad cars in front of the house			0
members of the @entity4 football team protested , marching in lieu of meeting and practice			0
backlash extended beyond campus as well , with hip - hop star @entity246 saying on @entity247 that he was canceling an upcoming show for the @entity249			1
" all races partying have a good time and enjoying themselves together peacefully			0
that 's what @entity246 is all about			1
for that reason , i must say i 'm disgusted and disappointed in the actions of the @entity3 fraternity at @entity4 and i will be canceling my scheduled performance for them next month			1
racism is something i will not tolerate , " the @entity262 rapper wrote			2
@entity5 's @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 , @entity270 and @entity271 contributed to this report .			1
