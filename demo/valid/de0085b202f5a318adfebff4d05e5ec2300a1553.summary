it recalled one of the most memorable moments in comic book history , but for critics on social media , one comic book cover went too far , and it 's now been pulled			1
@entity8 pulled the cover for the upcoming " @entity10 " # 41 , which portrays the @entity12 threatening a frightened @entity10 with a gun , with " @entity12 makeup " on her mouth			1
the @entity18 hashtag # changethecover had been trending since friday , when the cover was revealed			0
it 's a variant , aka an optional cover , which tends to grab the attention of collectors but wo n't be the main cover seen in most stores			2
for the month of june , @entity8 's variant covers are celebrating the 75th anniversary of the iconic villain			1
the cover recalls @entity31 's encounter with the @entity12 in the classic story " @entity32			1
" in it , he brutally attacked @entity31 , kidnapping her , and it was heavily implied that she was sexually assaulted			0
after being shot , the character remained in a wheelchair for decades , until @entity8 retconned @entity31 's fate in 2011 , allowing her to walk again and be @entity10			1
the criticism of the cover spread over a few days , though others defended it with their own hashtags			0
@entity8 ( owned by @entity43 , which also owns @entity1 ) said in a statement late monday that artist @entity46 's cover was going to be pulled			1
" regardless if fans like @entity46 's homage to @entity50 's @entity32 graphic novel from 25 years ago , or find it inconsistent with the current tonality of the @entity10 books -- threats of violence and harassment are wrong and have no place in comics or society , " they said			1
" we stand by our creative talent , and per @entity46 's request , @entity8 will not publish the @entity10 variant			1
" @entity63 said in his own statement , " my @entity10 variant cover artwork was designed to pay homage to a comic that i really admire , and i know is a favorite of many readers			1
' @entity32 ' is part of @entity10 's canon and artistically , i could n't avoid portraying the traumatic relationship between @entity31 and the @entity12			1
" he continued , " for me , it was just a creepy cover that brought up something from the character 's past that i was able to interpret artistically			2
but it has become clear , that for others , it touched a very important nerve			0
i respect these opinions and , despite whether the discussion is right or wrong , no opinion should be discredited			0
he concluded , " my intention was never to hurt or upset anyone through my art. for that reason , i have recommended to @entity8 that the variant cover be pulled			2
i 'm incredibly pleased that @entity8 is listening to my concerns and will not be publishing the cover art in june as previously announced			2
" @entity63 added in a tweet on monday night that he was never threatened ( the " threats " @entity8 referenced were aimed at those objecting to the cover , per " @entity10 " writer @entity96 )			1
@entity96 tweeted more : " i stand behind @entity46 as an artist and a friend , and think he made the right decision			0
the cover was not seen or approved by anyone on @entity10 and was completely at odds with what we are doing with the comic			2
so , we have the creators of the book and the artist himself all agreeing that the cover was inappropriate			0
there 's no ' censorship ' here			0
" that did n't stop the controversy on social media			0
it was just the latest brouhaha involving portrayals of women in comic books and variant covers in particular			0
in september , @entity120 canceled future variant covers from artist @entity122 after a " @entity124 " no. 1 variant cover caused an uproar for being " over-sexualized			0
" ( the company later said there was no connection between the two events			0

comic book portraying character with @entity12 makeup and gun to her head has stirred controversy
critics say it is too violent , creepy and out of step with the tone of the *series*
@entity8 says the scene recalls a memorable moment in @entity10 's canon
