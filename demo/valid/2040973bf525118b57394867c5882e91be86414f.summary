@entity7 about 75 % of the besieged @entity5 city of @entity6 is now back in government control , the head of a key paramilitary force taking part in the attack told @entity8 on thursday			1
the other 25 % is in the hands of about 150 @entity12 fighters who continue to hold out , said @entity13 , commander of the @entity15 militia			1
there has been no independent confirmation of such a significant advance by the @entity5 forces			1
but they have been making progress in recent days			0
@entity12 ' spokesman , @entity22 , called reports of coalition - member victories " delusional and fake			1
" he spoke of the coalition 's use of fighter jets , heavy artillery and tanks , saying it is a " nightmare and will go eventually			0
" on wednesday , joint @entity5 forces gained control of @entity33 , a few blocks south of the presidential palace			2
it 's part of their ongoing quest to wrest control from @entity12 , which captured the city last year			1
the predominantly @entity42 militia has been working with @entity5 troops as well as @entity45 fighters to try to regain @entity6			2
@entity6 , best known to @entity46 as the birthplace of former @entity5 dictator @entity48 , fell in june to @entity12 , which has captured large areas of @entity5 and @entity50 for what it says is its @entity53 caliphate			1
on march 1 , @entity5 prime minister @entity54 ordered @entity5 forces to retake @entity6 and @entity57 province			2
@entity12 was n't making it easy , however			2
the @entity45 extremist group blew up a key bridge near @entity6 , preventing the joint @entity5 forces from using it to cross the @entity61 to approach the city from the east			1
nevertheless , forces have made progress , forcing @entity12 fighters to retreat toward the city center from front - line positions , @entity65 's media office said			1
there have been several failed attempts to recapture @entity6 since the second half of 2014			0
if @entity5 regains control of the city , it could mean that retaking @entity77 -- a city 10 times bigger -- is possible			1
the @entity6 offensive involves around 30,000 fighters			0
also assisting is @entity81 , which has provided advisers , weapons and ammunition to the @entity5 government			2
according to the @entity87 , @entity86 may be operating heavy artillery and rocket launchers as well			0
gen. @entity90 , chairman of the @entity91 , told a hearing of the @entity93 on wednesday that the consensus was that @entity81 's involvement was positive in military terms			0
" anything anyone does to counter @entity12 is in the main a good outcome , " he said			2
but @entity90 also voiced concern over what might happen after @entity12 is defeated			2
a key question , he said , is " whether the government of @entity5 will remain on a path to provide an inclusive government for all of the groups " in @entity5			2
@entity6 could act as an important testing ground , with some observers concerned that if the predominantly @entity42 militias seize control , thanks in part to the support of majority - @entity81 , they could carry out reprisal attacks against the remaining @entity45 population there			0
such attacks could inflame already simmering sectarian tensions within @entity5 and make future efforts to retake @entity77 and bring peace to the country yet more difficult			2
in a possible sign of the problems to come , a number of posts on social media appear to show @entity5 soldiers in extremely graphic " selfies " with the heads of alleged @entity12 militants , or striking odd poses with bodies behind them			1
most of the photos are thought to have been taken during the @entity5 military offensive to retake @entity6 and other areas in @entity57 province , which started 10 days ago			1
two senior security officials in @entity139 told @entity8 , on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to media , that they are looking into these claims and they are also investigating similar incidents			1
they did not confirm or deny the authenticity of the images			0
@entity147 , a security expert at the @entity148 , said sectarian division was an issue to be " extremely concerned " about as @entity5 forces gain ground in @entity6			2
" it 's already been very clear to @entity5 that this is an @entity86 - led operation and not one which has the support of the coalition , " he said			2
as some @entity5 question why the @entity161 has not taken more decisive action , he said , " this may be a case where @entity81 may be gaining very serious influence			0
" if there are reprisals in @entity6 and it becomes a " @entity42 - on - @entity45 struggle , " @entity147 said , then not only will @entity81 's influence increase " but you can see the country divide and @entity165 ( @entity12 ) be replaced by a conflict between @entity5 shiite and @entity45			1
" strong leadership will be needed from the government in @entity7 , headed by @entity54 , militia leaders and senior religious figures to prevent this outcome , he said , with a lot already being done on this front			0
the top @entity5 @entity42 cleric , grand ayatollah @entity180 , he said , " very clearly says that @entity5 must act as @entity5 , not divide along sectarian lines			0
" the challenge will be ensuring that fighters on the ground , some angered by the killings of their relatives by @entity12 , do not seek vengeance against @entity45 communities whom they suspect of supporting the group			0
while @entity5 forces piled the pressure on @entity12 in @entity6 , the @entity45 extremist group continued to flex its muscles in @entity5 's western @entity194 province , where it is finding a support base among the predominantly @entity45 population			1
more than 40 @entity5 soldiers were killed when @entity12 blew up the @entity5 army headquarters just outside @entity200 , an @entity194 provincial leader told @entity8 on thursday			1
militants dug a tunnel and detonated hundreds of homemade explosives , said @entity204 , head of the @entity205			0
@entity12 launched a new offensive on @entity200 , west of @entity7 , on wednesday morning , @entity207 , the deputy head of the council , said in a statement			1
the city is being attacked " from all directions , " with @entity12 firing more than 150 mortar rounds and rockets , he said , and explosives - laden vehicles used to attack security checkpoints and a bridge			1
officials believe " this is an @entity12 response to the @entity6 operation that is ongoing in the north , " @entity207 said			1
@entity161 - led coalition forces carried out 13 airstrikes in @entity5 between wednesday and thursday morning , a statement said			0
five hit @entity12 targets near @entity226 , and three struck @entity12 units and a vehicle near @entity229			0
elsewhere in @entity194 province , @entity5 security forces have managed to wrest back most of the town of @entity233 , near @entity229 , from @entity12 , said @entity204 , the head of the @entity205 , on wednesday			1
@entity5 security forces were fighting side by side with @entity237 units and local tribesmen , @entity204 said			0
@entity12 is also battling in many places far from @entity6 , including @entity50 , where the militant group is more on the offensive , according to the @entity242 , a @entity243 - based monitoring group			0
clashes continued thursday between the @entity245 , or @entity246 , and @entity12 fighters in @entity249 , a @entity50 strategic border town with @entity251 , the @entity50 observatory said in a statement			0
hundreds of @entity12 militants launched a large - scale offensive wednesday in the town , the group said			1
dozens have been killed from both sides			0
@entity8 's @entity258 reported from @entity7 , and @entity259 wrote from @entity243			0
@entity8 's @entity260 , @entity261 , @entity262 and @entity263 contributed to this report .			0
