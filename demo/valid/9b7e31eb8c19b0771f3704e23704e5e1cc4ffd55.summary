@entity0 either @entity2 just staged the most dramatic political comeback in @entity5 history and beyond , or something was very wrong with the polls before and during the election			1
polls predicted a tight race coming down to the wire , with @entity2 in a virtual tie with his main challenger , @entity13 of the @entity14			1
only four days before the election , polls showed @entity13 taking a four - seat lead into the final weekend before the election			1
exit polls on the night of the election showed @entity2 had closed the gap			1
the polls suggested he was in a dead heat , with a very even split between right - wing and left - wing parties			1
not more polls or surveys , but actual counts from the ballot boxes			1
@entity2 was n't in a fight for his political life after all			1
he was the clear winner , running away with the election and facing a fairly clear path to create a coalition government			1
although the results are unofficial , it seems almost certain that @entity2 will remain the @entity5 prime minister			1
@entity37 , a pollster , professor at @entity38 and president of the @entity40 , saw very different results from his own polls			1
he never anticipated a @entity44 victory			2
instead , he says , he always saw @entity45 holding a lead			0
the mistake that others made , according to @entity37 , was in the methodology			2
" the internet does not represent the state of @entity5 and the people of @entity5 , " he said , referring to modern statistical methods			0
" it represents panels , and the panels are biased strongly to the center -- @entity58 , better - educated , more participants in this kind of conversation			2
and people who are in the periphery and so on and have the stronger tendency to vote @entity45 , i think , are poorly represented			0
" " i have tested sometimes at the same night , doing by telephone as i do always -- and very specifically geographically , and very well - weighted and very well , having cell phones and other phones and so on -- and at the same time i did on the @entity51			2
and i got results which are very , very different			2
" but @entity71 , the polling expert for @entity1 affiliate @entity73 , suggests @entity2 was in a tight race the entire way and managed to close the gap " like a magician , " using the election polls as his final trick			1
" the polls showed that they are going to lose			2
it gave very important information both to the public and to the politicians			0
@entity2 used it , " said @entity71			2
" many voted what we call strategic voting			0
they did not vote to the party that is their first preference , but they voted for the @entity45			0
" @entity45 voters did not participate in exit polls , according to @entity71 , and that skewed the results , leading many to believe that @entity13 had tied @entity2			1
" we had ballots in an area where there are a lot of immigrants from the @entity102 , " explained @entity71			0
" in these ballots , more than 30 % did not participate in our polls , and they are @entity45 supporters			0
" another factor that may have worked in @entity2 's favor was his @entity45 party cannibalizing votes from other right - wing parties			1
in the days before the election , @entity2 moved to the political right , making a big push for right - wing voters to choose his party over other ideologically similar parties , such as @entity117 's @entity115 and @entity118 's @entity108			1
during the weekend before the election , @entity2 took part in a right - wing rally in @entity58 's central @entity121			1
he continued his shift to the right in a series of interviews with local media leading up to the election			0
his most controversial statement came the day before the elections when he reversed his publicly stated position on a two - state solution			0
" anyone who is going to establish a @entity134 state , anyone who is going to evacuate territories today , is simply giving a base for attacks to the radical @entity139 against @entity5 , " he said in a television interview			0
" this is the true reality that was created here in the last few years			0
" in 2009 , in a speech known as the @entity145 speech , @entity2 committed to negotiations for a two - state solution , saying , " let us begin peace negotiations immediately without prior conditions			1
@entity5 is committed to international agreements , and expects all sides to fulfill their obligations			0
i say to the @entity134 : we want to live with you in peace , quiet , and good neighborly relations			0
" @entity71 estimates that @entity45 took four seats from @entity115 and two more seats from @entity160 , a party that did not receive enough votes to warrant inclusion in the @entity163 , @entity5 's parliament			2
exit polls in @entity5 have been wrong before			0
in the most recent elections in 2013 , exit polls showed @entity169 's centrist @entity168 party winning between 12 and 13 seats in the @entity163			1
but when the final results were tallied , @entity169 won 19 seats , becoming a major player in the government			0
this time , the unexpected surprise worked in @entity2 's favor , turning the campaign race into an election night rout			1
@entity45 had never polled better than approximately 25 seats , but it grabbed at least 29 of the 120 seats in the @entity163 , according to unofficial numbers from the @entity5 election committee based on 99 % of the vote			0
@entity2 has worked this sort of magic once before			2
in the 1996 elections , early results showed the @entity189 's @entity188 as the winner , but as more results came in , @entity2 eked out a victory by fewer than 1 % of the votes			1
@entity37 said this election reveals the truth behind @entity5 politics			0
" this last election it showed very clearly that we do not have right and left			0
we have only right and extreme right , which is not nice sometimes			0
and in the right , you have the @entity45 mostly , and in the @entity45 , you have mostly @entity2			2

polls predicted a tight race coming down to the wire , with @entity2 in a virtual tie with @entity13 of the @entity44 party
but actual results show @entity2 running away with the election
possible causes : poll methodology , @entity2 's last - minute turn to the right
