the man who attacked a security area at the @entity5 airport with a machete and wasp spray also had a bag of @entity10 cocktails and a car containing smoke bombs and gas cylinders , authorities said			1
the suspect , @entity15 , 63 , died saturday after treatment for three bullet wounds he suffered when a sheriff 's lieutenant fired at him to halt the friday night attack , the @entity14 said			1
sheriff @entity21 said earlier that investigators had n't been able to talk to @entity15 , who officials said suffered from some type of mental illness			1
he said @entity15 's wife and children had been very cooperative			1
@entity29 was back open and fully operational , mayor @entity28 said			2
he praised security officials for acting quickly and heroically and doing everything they could to stop the attack			1
the incident began when @entity15 , carrying a bag , entered one of the lanes at the security checkpoint for @entity41 and began spraying @entity43 agents and bystanders with a can of wasp spray , the sheriff 's office said			1
he then pulled a machete from his waistband and began swinging it at agents and others in the area			1
" what i saw originally was one of the officers getting sprayed with the wasp spray , " said @entity43 agent @entity53 , whose arm was hit by one of the bullets fired at @entity15			1
the officer being sprayed with wasp spray picked up a bag and threw it at @entity15 to slow him down , but the suspect still barged through , @entity53 told reporters			1
@entity53 , who was not armed , yelled for everyone to run as she made her way toward the sheriff 's lieutenant , who she knew had a weapon			2
" i was calling , ' @entity71 , run ' for them to get away from him , and i was calling for the ( lieutenant ) so she was there and alert , " @entity53 said			0
" i did n't hear him say anything , " she said			0
" once i yelled for the checkpoint to be cleared , i looked over my shoulder and he was coming after me			0
and i ran as fast as i could and thank @entity82 the officer was as close as she was , because i would n't be here today			0
" she said the man came " within inches " of whacking her with the machete			2
" this man was swinging very hard , very hard with that machete , " @entity53 said			2
" and if he would have made contact with anybody , it would have been terrible			0
" @entity21 said lt. @entity90 fired three shots , ultimately stopping the attacker			0
he said investigators believe it was the first shot that went through @entity53 's upper right arm			0
@entity53 showed off a bright pink bandage on her arm and said the bullet went through her tricep			2
" originally , i thought the machete hit me			2
i did n't realize it was a bullet , " she said			2
" i knew he was close , so i honestly thought he hit me and she shot him			0
" when @entity15 approached the checkpoint , he was carrying a bag that he dropped as soon as the first agent confronted him , @entity21 said			1
" what the bag revealed was six half - pint mason jars with cloth wicks into a liquid that we now know to be gasoline -- what you would commonly refer to as a @entity10 cocktail , " @entity21 said			1
a grill lighter and plastic letter opener were also in the bag , and next to his body investigators found powdery material and wicks , which they determined were from crushed smoke bombs			1
" the fact that he ended up dropping the bag ( when ) the @entity43 agent threw an item at him was huge in the short 40 - second span ... of this event , " @entity21 said			0
" had he been able to hold onto the bag , he might not have continued to chase the @entity43 agents through the checkpoint			0
he might have gone somewhere else			0
" the bomb squad found more smoke bombs in his car , and in the trunk were three gas tanks -- one for @entity136 , one for oxygen and one for acetylene , a compressed gas used in welding and metal - cutting			1
@entity21 said their intended purpose was n't clear			0
@entity21 said " there is a mental illness component " in their investigation of the suspect			2
" no one at this point in time has any notion about what may have triggered this behavior , " @entity21 said			0
" and not unlike dealing with the mentally ill , sometimes you will never know what actually triggers some of this type of behavior			0
" people who had recently interacted with @entity15 described him as very cordial , calm , cool and collected , @entity21 said			1
they reported having no suspicions about him and said nothing seemed out of the ordinary			0
it was n't clear why @entity15 was at the airport			1
contrary to earlier reports , @entity21 said saturday , @entity15 was no longer a taxi driver			1
@entity1 's @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 contributed to this report .			0
