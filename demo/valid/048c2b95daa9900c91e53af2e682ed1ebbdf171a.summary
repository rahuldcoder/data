a crowd of tens of thousands filled @entity3 in @entity4 on saturday evening , calling for a change in @entity7 leadership amid growing discontent with the current administration			1
the rally , called " @entity11 , " was put on by one million hands , a grassroots movement that focuses its efforts on two major issues : a two - state solution and a reduction in the cost of living			2
on both of these topics , founder @entity19 says , prime minister @entity22 has failed			1
" we think that the only way to go forward on that account is to change government and to get this current government out of office			2
to get @entity22 out of office , " says @entity29			2
organizers are not promoting any specific candidate or pushing voters toward any political party in the march 17 balloting			1
instead , they are encouraging voters to change the current administration			2
police estimated the crowd at 40,000 people			0
headlining the rally was @entity42 , the former head of @entity43 , @entity7 's spy agency , and a vocal critic of @entity22			1
in recent weeks , @entity42 criticized @entity22 's decision to speak before the @entity47 , and he continued his criticism at the rally , saying that he has never seen such stagnation in @entity7 politics			1
@entity22 still has broad support in @entity7 , and his @entity54 party is doing well in the polls			1
the @entity56 is @entity54 's primary challenger			0
in the initial round of polling immediately following @entity22 's speech before @entity47 , the @entity56 was expected to win 24 seats in the @entity61 while @entity54 was expected to win 23 seats			0
the poll comes from @entity2 affiliate @entity64			0
because of the nature of @entity7 politics , @entity22 's @entity54 party could lose the election while @entity22 still becomes prime minister			1
in many ways , this rally was reminiscent of a similar social movement that began in the summer of 2011			0
hundreds of thousands of protesters packed the streets of @entity4 , demanding improvements in the cost of housing , education , and health care			1
what started as a small social media campaign turned into a nationwide movement that spread to other major cities			0
