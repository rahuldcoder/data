it looks like the @entity2 in @entity3 have failed again			0
@entity5 @entity4 defeated a plan pushed by senate majority leader @entity7 to fund the @entity8 , money that congressional @entity4 have been holding hostage in their effort to overturn president @entity13 's executive order on immigration			1
@entity15 proposed that there would be a separate vote on the immigration issue			0
when speaker @entity21 proposed an even narrower compromise , funding the @entity8 for only three more weeks , his caucus said no. the final bill provides funding for one more week , at which point @entity3 needs to take up the issue again			1
yet from a different perspective , congressional republicans are achieving their goal			0
once again they are using up a valuable chunk of president @entity13 's political time			1
@entity3 has already squandered several months rather than addressing bigger questions , such as economic inequality or climate change , which the @entity5 hoped to put at the center of political debate even if the @entity4 refused to do anything about these problems			1
while the odds of the president making progress on key issues is extremely slim , president @entity13 has not even had a chance to introduce issues fully into public debate -- a key function of presidents who hope to build the groundwork for future legislative breakthroughs and shape the national conversation -- or to even to attempt to make progress on issues , like tax reform , where there is potential support for a bipartisan breakthrough			1
using up the legislative clock has been central to the @entity4 strategy since the 2010 midterm elections , a tactic that the @entity60 have found difficult to fight back against			1
the strategy has been pretty straightforward			0
each time that president @entity13 tried to introduce a new issue to the nation , whether that has to do with immigration reform or economic inequality , @entity4 have instantly shifted public attention elsewhere by threatening extreme action on some other area of policy			1
this is what @entity4 did in 2010 and 2011 when they warned that they would not raise the debt limit ceiling if @entity60 did not accede to their budget demands			1
@entity3 spent many months wrangling over the budget as they faced the real possibility of the federal government going into default			0
this was all that anyone in @entity80 was talking about			0
the @entity4 did the same with the threat of a government shutdown			2
even though the possibility of repealing the @entity84 is remote , @entity4 keep bringing it up for a debate , forcing @entity60 to defend the program and spending more time on a proposal that nobody really thinks stands a chance of passing			1
the " tea party " faction of the @entity2 has been pivotal to this strategy as was clear this week			0
since they have shown repeatedly that they are willing to employ the most extreme measures to defend their principles , and that they wo n't allow @entity21 to rein them in for " practical " political considerations , @entity60 ca n't afford to take the threats lightly			0
@entity4 leaders can and have said to the @entity5 they would like to find reasonable solutions to these problems , but with a nod to the @entity4 caucus , remind @entity13 that they do n't have full control			1
while it is true that these tactics have hurt the name brand of the @entity4 and place @entity4 presidential candidates at greater risk in 2016 , many congressional republicans have been willing to suffer hits in the polls because the tactic has allowed them to continue using up time on the legislative calendar			2
aside from vetoing bills , president @entity13 does n't have many options other than to watch the clock tick away			2
now the @entity4 has done it again			2
even if there is a resolution that continues funding for the @entity8 , months have been consumed on @entity122			1
when the year began president @entity13 wanted to make economic inequality a defining theme for the year			2
he wanted to use the limited power he had to bring more attention to the growing divide between the rich and the poor , as well as the struggles facing middle class @entity129			0
but he has only had limited success			0
instead , he and his party have been consumed with this struggle over the budget bill			0
when @entity5 @entity4 pushed their " stop - gap " measure to fund @entity8 for just another week , they were following the standard game plan			1
by avoiding permanent solutions to budgeting problems , and keeping the debate over these issues in play for even more time , the @entity4 continues to eat away at the president 's political clock			2
usually political extremism does not have the virtues that sen. @entity148 claimed in his famous 1964 speech to the @entity150 , but it sure can have short - term political benefits in @entity3			0
just ask @entity7 , who can barely contain his grin .			0

@entity154 : @entity4 hogs the *spotlight* with funding *deadlines* like the battle over money for the @entity8 .
he says the continual *crises* *deprive* @entity13 of the chance to move his agenda forward even *slightly*
