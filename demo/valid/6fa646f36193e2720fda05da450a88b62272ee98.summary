@entity0 , the father of the @entity3 language , is turning in his grave			1
believe it or not , the land where @entity6 originated and from which many other @entity8 languages descend is becoming " illiterate			1
" not only have @entity3 long forgotten the language of their @entity11 , but they hardly know how to speak and write proper @entity3			1
they 've been negatively dubbed " asini " ( donkeys ) , as in " stupid			2
" if you take a look at @entity3 language forums and debate websites it 's clear that many @entity3 are clueless on grammar and do n't even know how to use verbs properly			1
at age 15 , @entity3 students rank below the @entity24 average literacy level and @entity25 reports that @entity3 has the lowest percentage of university graduates aged 30 - 34 in the @entity28			1
evening news bulletins are full of speakers and commentators making grammatical errors and even mispronouncing words			2
how could @entity0 's land become " ignorant " and will the government 's plans to institute yet another education reform succeed in turning some donkeys -- if not into nerds -- at least into smart pupils ? the decline in language skills is a trend affecting most of the western world , but the fact that this is happening in @entity3 , home to some of the world 's oldest universities , is quite alarming			1
the @entity51 built an empire united by the @entity6 language , but @entity3 seem to have lost such heritage			1
@entity3 were once " literate " -- as in " latin - speakers and latin - writers " -- grammar - savvy , poetry lovers , rhetoric freaks and great philosophers			1
now they 've forgotten what a conjunctive verb is , mistake adjectives for nouns and write @entity64 with a double " c. " oh -- and they do n't know how to break words into syllables			0
true , one could say @entity3 is a tough language , one of the most complex in the world			1
but that 's not a good excuse			0
the @entity3 people 's declining knowledge of their language is turning into a national emergency			1
it 's not just lazy students who are responsible			0
the percentage of lawyers who every year flunk the written examination to become a judge is scary			0
when i attended university , the most dreaded exam of all was the essay on @entity3 literature and history			1
few of my buddies passed it at the first go , others had to take it thrice and many just gave up			0
so how did we fall so low ? fine , @entity97 , smartphones and sms are partly to blame			0
abbreviations , misspellings and the introduction of many @entity104 words into @entity3 have impoverished language skills			2
yet on its own that explanation is too reductive			0
the loss of @entity6 teaching in schools is at the root of the problem			1
learning @entity6 assists in learning @entity3 and other languages as well as opening the mind to all fields of knowledge			1
it 's been no secret across generations of scholars that being familiar with the complexity of @entity6 phrase structure and idioms is positive for students			2
up until 1970 , @entity6 was taught in primary and middle schools : kids learned to translate works by @entity128 without using a dictionary and to recite chunks of the " @entity131 " and poems by @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135			1
but today the teaching of @entity6 is restricted to specific humanist and scientific high schools -- called gymnasiums or lyceums -- and at university level depending upon the faculty			1
the crisis has dealt a further blow to the love of classics			0
enrollment at classical lyceums , where also ancient @entity148 is also taught , is low : only 31,860 out of a total 530,911 high school students have enrolled this academic year			0
desperate attempts by modern writers to revive classical culture by translating @entity155 's " @entity154 " and @entity64 's " @entity156 " into modern @entity3 have n't produced great results			2
so far just one academy in @entity159 -- vivarium @entity160 -- has succeeded in bringing the " dead language " back from the grave			0
pupils here exclusively speak in @entity6 and are kicked - out if they get caught saying a few words in @entity3			1
but the academy is an isolated case , looked upon as a bit " out of this world			0
" families think learning @entity6 and @entity148 is pointless because it wo n't help their kids find a job , which is wrong			2
the trouble is that students have already lost their memory			0
not in the literal sense , but symbolically			0
the " ars mnemonica " -- the art of exercising one 's memory , that boring yet useful technique which implies rote learning of phrases , lyrics , novels and even entire epics -- belongs to the past			0
if you do n't sharpen mental skills , how can there be good writing ? the truth is that @entity3 education is badly in need of a restyle			2
a series of education reforms in the past few years has lowered the quality of teaching by reducing public resources and the hours of @entity6 and @entity3 language learning , which teaching unions say has had a negative impact on pupils ' text comprehension skills			1
@entity6 teaching should be given more space but in a new way : not through useless translations ( what do kids care about @entity214 's " treaty on @entity213 ? " ) but through open debates and analyses on ancient texts that are still worthwhile studying today			1
and teachers should also get a makeover			2
if there are " bad " students it 's because there are also " bad " teachers			0
pupils want to read more than just one contemporary novel per month			0
they want teachers who are passionate about their jobs rather than lazily coasting towards retirement			0
language teaching depends on its appeal			2
and right now it 's not .			0
