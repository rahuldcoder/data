@entity0 , and your gift will be multiplied			2
that may sound like an esoteric adage , but when @entity8 selflessly decided to give one of her kidneys to a stranger , her generosity paired up with big data			1
it resulted in six patients receiving transplants			1
that surprised and wowed her			2
" i thought i was going to help this one person who i do n't know , but the fact that so many people can have a life extension , that 's pretty big , " @entity8 told @entity1 affiliate @entity17			1
she may feel guided in her generosity by a higher power			2
" thanks for all the support and prayers , " a comment on a @entity26 page in her name read			2
" i know this entire journey is much bigger than all of us			2
i also know i 'm just the messenger			0
" @entity1 can not verify the authenticity of the page			0
but the power that multiplied @entity8 's gift was data processing of genetic profiles from donor - recipient pairs			1
it works on a simple swapping principle but takes it to a much higher level , according to @entity44 in @entity45			0
so high , that it is taking five surgeons , a covey of physician assistants , nurses and anesthesiologists , and more than 40 support staff to perform surgeries on 12 people			0
they are extracting six kidneys from donors and implanting them into six recipients			0
" the ages of the donors and recipients range from 26 to 70 and include three parent and child pairs , one sibling pair and one brother and sister - in - law pair , " the medical center said in a statement			0
the chain of surgeries is to be wrapped up friday			0
in late march , the medical center is planning to hold a reception for all 12 patients			1
here 's how the super swap works , according to @entity44			0
say , your brother needs a kidney to save his life , or at least get off of dialysis , and you 're willing to give him one of yours			1
but then it turns out that your kidney is not a match for him , and it 's certain his body would reject it			1
your brother can then get on a years - long waiting list for a kidney coming from an organ donor who died			1
maybe that will work out -- or not , and time could run out for him			0
alternatively , you and your brother could look for another recipient - living donor couple like yourselves -- say , two more siblings , where the donor 's kidney is n't suited for his sister , the recipient			1
but maybe your kidney is a match for his sister , and his kidney is a match for your brother			1
so , you 'd do a swap			0
that 's called a paired donation			1
it 's a bit of a surgical square dance , where four people cross over partners temporarily and everybody goes home smiling			0
but instead of a square dance , @entity8 's generous move set off a chain reaction , like dominoes falling			1
her kidney , which was removed thursday , went to a recipient , who was paired with a donor			2
that donor 's kidney went to the next recipient , who was also paired with a donor , and so on			2
on friday , the last donor will give a kidney to someone who has been biding time on one of those deceased donor lists to complete the chain			1
such long - chain transplanting is rare			0
it 's been done before , @entity44 said in a statement , but matching up the people in the chain has been laborious and taken a long time			0
that changed when a computer programmer named @entity137 received a kidney transplant			1
he had been waiting on a deceased donor list , when a live donor came along -- someone nice enough to give away a kidney to a stranger			1
@entity137 paid it forward with his programming skills , creating @entity146 , a program that genetically matches up donor pairs or chains quickly			2
" when we did a five - way swap a few years ago , which was one of the largest , it took about three to four months			0
we did this in about three weeks , " @entity137 said			0
but this chain would n't have worked so quickly without @entity8 's generosity -- or may not have worked at all			1
" the significance of the altruistic donor is that it opens up possibilities for pairing compatible donors and recipients , " said dr. @entity157			0
" where there had been only three or four options , with the inclusion of the altruistic donor , we had 140 options to consider for matching donors and recipients			0
" and that 's divine , @entity8 's friend @entity168 wrote in a comment her on @entity8 's facebook page			1
" you are a true angel my friend			0
