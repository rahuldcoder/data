earlier this month , @entity0 , @entity2 's vice president for @entity3 , led an official delegation to the @entity6 in @entity7 to attend the 59th session of the @entity9			1
in her march 11 speech to the commission , @entity10 said that " the @entity13 of @entity2 has always had the empowerment of women and improving their status ... on its agenda			0
" @entity10 described the significant progress @entity2 women have made in education and science , citing unilateral economic sanctions and violence against women as factors that have impeded the full realization of women 's rights			1
there was little in her speech to suggest that domestic factors -- including @entity2 's laws and policies -- play a significant role in depriving @entity2 women of real gender equality and empowerment			2
unfortunately , @entity10 's comments stood in sharp contrast to reality			0
on the day she delivered her speech , @entity40 released a report raising concerns about the possible passage of two bills before @entity2 's parliament that would further restrict women 's rights			1
one would prohibit voluntary sterilization as part of the country 's efforts to boost population growth and strengthen the place of what are deemed " traditional " families in society			0
the other would " further entrench gender - based discrimination , particularly against women who choose not to or are unable to marry or have children , " @entity40 said			0
a day later , the @entity6 special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in @entity2 , @entity64 , released his fourth report to the @entity66 describing the dire state of human rights in the country			0
his report cited the concerns about gender discrimination that @entity73 and others had raised during @entity2 's 2014 @entity75 , a review of every @entity6 state 's human rights record every four years by the @entity66			2
the sobering reality , all too familiar to @entity0 , is that @entity2 women face discrimination in many aspects of their lives , ranging from issues related to marriage , divorce , inheritance and child custody , to restrictions on dress and even access to sports stadiums as spectators			0
the proposed passage of more restrictive legislation in the name of protecting the family is just the latest step in the rollback on women 's rights in recent years			1
to many , the discrepancy between what @entity10 said in her speech , and what women face in @entity2 , smacked of diplomatic subterfuge			0
activists and journalists rightly responded by highlighting the many violations of women 's rights in @entity2 , and called out @entity0 for failing to present an accurate and complete picture of the challenges that @entity2 women face			1
yet there was little acknowledgment by critics of the behind - the - scenes struggle that @entity10 , who is often an outspoken critic of regressive measures restricting women 's rights at home , and many others are waging every day as they try to carve out much - needed space for @entity2 's beleaguered rights activists			1
just two days before the @entity6 session , @entity2 's conservative @entity120 daily , thought to be close to the office of supreme leader @entity122 , published an article that showed just what @entity2 's women 's rights activists are up against			1
the author questioned the wisdom of allowing an official delegation to attend events such as the @entity6 commission , describing its notion of " gender equality " as " unacceptable to the @entity13			0
" the article accused @entity10 of " negligence " for participating in events that could damage @entity2 's reputation and interests , and accused the 150 or so people who attended the session as representatives of @entity2 groups of doing so without full and proper vetting by @entity2 's security and intelligence agencies			2
what 's striking about @entity120 's attack is that @entity2 's powerful security and intelligence apparatus has for years acted to repress independent groups , including women 's rights activists			1
groups like the @entity153 , a grassroots effort designed to operate within the law to collect signatures supporting the repeal of laws that discriminate against women , were targeted as security officials detained their members on spurious " national security " grounds			0
but those hostile to women 's rights in @entity2 remain unrelenting			1
anyone who fails , willingly or unknowingly , to heed their threats may face reprisals , as several activists who attempted to attend similar @entity6 events in previous years found out			0
yet @entity120 's attack also reflects the resilience and adaptability of women 's groups in @entity2 as they continue to challenge the state 's monopoly on the women 's rights narrative			1
while @entity2 women lost some important legal rights after the 1979 revolution , their social and economic stature increased on average as they gained wider access to education , health care , and birth control			2
the image of the compromised and submissive woman engendered by @entity2 's discriminatory legal system bears little resemblance to the private and public lives of many @entity2 women today			2
so while we rightfully condemn the disconnect between what @entity10 said at the @entity6 , and what @entity2 women face , let us not lose sight of another reality : the paradox that exists in @entity2 between the state 's regressive laws and policies against women , and the tireless and undaunted drive for change and equality by those who will not be denied			2
that effort , at the very least , deserves our respect .			0
