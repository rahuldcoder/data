" in order to attain the impossible , one must attempt the absurd , " wrote @entity1 , the @entity2 of @entity3			1
and the quest to find his remains has sometimes seemed both , even ( dare one say it ) quixotic in a time of recession			0
but forensic scientists have persevered , and appear to have triumphed			2
almost 400 years after @entity1 ' death , a team led by @entity12 announced tuesday that they were confident they had found @entity1 ' coffin in the crypt of the @entity16 of the @entity17 in the @entity18 ( @entity19 ) in @entity20			1
historical records indicated @entity1 had been buried there , but the convent had been substantially rebuilt since			1
( @entity12 , incidentally , performed the autopsy on former @entity26 president gen. @entity25 , confirming he had committed suicide			0
) at a news conference in @entity20 on tuesday , @entity12 said that while there was no mathematical proof or dna test available to completely verify the findings , there were " many coincidences and no discrepancies " in the examination of " @entity37 32 , " a common grave in the crypt that contained the remains of 16 people			0
" we have @entity1 , represented in some form in this group of bones that are unfortunately very degraded and very fragmented , " @entity12 told national television			1
the search for @entity1 ' coffin -- using radar -- began last year , funded by the @entity49			1
it first mapped more than 30 burial cavities in the walls and nearly 5 meters beneath the floor of the church			2
mass spectrometry dated fragments of wood and cloth found in these cavities to the 17th century , an encouraging but far from conclusive development			2
one crumbling coffin found in january had the initials " @entity63 " hammered in nail heads , along with a jumble of skeletal remains			0
even then @entity67 urged caution , but further research has narrowed the odds			0
the forensic team had been hoping that some of those remains would positively identify @entity1 , who suffered gunshot wounds in the chest and left hand at the @entity77 in 1571			1
but they are not in sufficiently good shape , and some of the remains found may be of @entity1 ' wife , @entity80			1
nor will dna analysis be much help , for there are no known descendants of @entity1			1
@entity80 was not @entity1 ' first partner			2
as a teenager he ran away from home with a barmaid , @entity89 , before enlisting with the @entity90			0
it was only in the 1580s that he started to write , publishing " @entity93 " in 1585 and his most famous work , " @entity95 , " in 1605 -- or to give its full title , " the adventures of the @entity98 @entity95 of @entity99			0
" but " @entity95 " would hardly be noticed in @entity1 ' lifetime , and he was almost penniless when he died , having joined the @entity101 in his declining years			1
he knew he was dying when he wrote in the prologue of a posthumously published novel , " perhaps the time may come when i mend again this broken thread and say what words fail me here and what needed to be said			0
farewell , waggish jokes ; farewell , wittiness ; farewell , merry friends , for i am dying and longing soon to see you , happy in the life to come			0
" @entity1 was buried on april 23,1616 -- in the same week @entity2 died			1
there are now plans to reinter @entity1 at the convent and build a new entrance to the crypt in time for the 400th anniversary of @entity1 ' death next year			2
@entity120 , a lecturer in @entity122 studies at @entity123 in @entity124 , says that such exhumations " ignite public attention , inspire re-readings , and invest an all - but - forgotten corner of the city with a renewed , imaginative depth			0
" @entity1 might enjoy all the attention			2
many literary critics say he was not aware of his own genius			0
@entity135 , a scholar and translator of @entity1 ' work in the 19th century , wrote of " @entity95 , " " @entity138 was a great work so neglected by its author			1
" @entity0 's @entity142 contributed to this report .			0
