@entity0 , @entity1 @entity1 's security forces are predicting a drawn - out battle with @entity5 as evidence filters out that the insurgents are now recruiting there			1
" we do n't doubt that @entity5 is recruiting in @entity1 , " said col. @entity8 , commander of @entity9 , a special military operation set up by @entity1 's government to fight the @entity13 terrorist group			1
he says communities bordering @entity13 have been emptied of men between the ages of 10 and 45			0
" many of them are found across the border in @entity13 , training with the terrorists , " he told @entity2			0
this has made it difficult for the country 's defense forces to adequately estimate the power of the terrorist group			2
@entity8 said the number of militants may be greater than is widely believed , though there is no reliable estimate of the group 's strength			2
" @entity5 is a permanent metamorphosis , dying every day but recruiting every day as well , " says col. @entity35 , interim commander of the @entity36			2
" and this complicates a lot of things for us			0
" @entity8 agreed : " we kill them , but they keep on coming			0
" @entity5 is a @entity13 - based @entity44 group whose purpose is to institute @entity47 , or @entity44 law			2
they have carried out a campaign of terror in northern @entity13 , killing thousands , taking hundreds captive , and occupying swaths of territory in @entity54			2
as many as 200,000 @entity13 have fled to neighboring countries , creating an urgent humanitarian situation , the @entity55 high commissioner for refugees reported last month			0
for the past two years , @entity5 fighters have been carrying out cross-border raids on @entity1 , slaughtering hundreds and torching entire neighborhoods			1
but as the country 's defense forces -- later joined by battle - hardened @entity66 troops -- turned up the momentum against the insurgents , the terrorists began to swell their ranks with @entity1			1
@entity8 said he believes " most of the worst attacks we have suffered " were carried out by @entity1 fighting for @entity5			1
also , the militants ' ability to hit several different places at once , and with precision , suggests that " there are people over here giving them information , " @entity8 said			0
in january , @entity5 struck @entity79 , a @entity1 town separated by only a bridge from @entity82 , @entity13 , a stronghold of the @entity85 extremists			1
the attackers killed more than 400 people			0
@entity1 and @entity66 soldiers stationed there managed to kill 150 invaders			2
among them was the son of @entity92 , a @entity79 resident			0
for two months , @entity92 did n't know the whereabouts of his son , @entity95 , or what he was doing			0
he did n't find out until the aftermath of the fighting , when locals removed the veil on one of the dead attackers to reveal his 15 - year - old boy 's face			2
" i was really shocked and embarrassed at the development , " @entity92 said			2
while it 's difficult to fathom the appeal of extreme , violent doctrine among young @entity1 , ambient poverty and chronic unemployment in the @entity111 may explain why some there are lured to @entity5 pay			1
the government 's @entity114 found the region to be the country 's poorest , with 60 % of the population living in poverty			1
@entity120 , an opposition member of @entity1 's parliament , told @entity2 that the government of president @entity125 " has for over 30 years now failed to create jobs for the youths			1
and in such circumstances , they may be easily manipulated into joining such hate groups			0
" a senior government official from the region , who would not be named , agreed , saying that " in a context of such extreme poverty , it could n't be otherwise			1
" " no significant economic project has been carried out there ... the @entity111 is the most populated in the country , but has been completely abandoned , " the official explained			0
" so it 's not surprising that youths should be sensitive to calls by @entity5			1
" desperate youths are n't the only recruits , however			0
very often , police are bribed into collaborating			0
in january , @entity144 , senior inspector of police in @entity146 , was arrested by the military and accused of using his position as head of the @entity150 in the @entity111 town to issue @entity1 id cards to militants coming in from @entity13			1
security officials say such a move makes it easy for @entity5 to infiltrate @entity1 and gather vital security information			1
along with the presence of some 6,000 @entity1 troops and plans to deploy some 20,000 more over the next two years , the government now has come up with a $ 135 million program to finance 94 development projects			1
part of the money will be used to increase cereal production by 30 % in the @entity111 , where child malnutrition now stands at some 70 % , according to economy minister @entity168			0
other investments will be made in road construction , railway development , mining and social services			0
" we ca n't easily win this war with military means alone , " said @entity174 , the regional governor			0
" the development package government has put in place will definitely keep many young people busy , and therefore will not be charmed by the false promises of the terrorist group			1
" but development projects can only be carried out in a climate of peace , and officials here hope that the @entity188 -- about 8,500 troops from @entity1 , @entity66 , @entity190 , @entity13 and @entity191 -- will defeat @entity5 and lay that groundwork .			1
