the death of the founding father of @entity2 last monday is an appropriate occasion to reflect on nation building			1
as prime minister for its first three decades , @entity6 raised a poor port from the bottom rungs of the third world to the first world in a single generation			1
as it prepares to mark its 50th anniversary as a nation , @entity2 is today an ultra-modern metropolis of almost six million people with higher per capita gdp than the @entity18 , according to the @entity19			1
@entity6 's achievement in building a successful nation contrasts sharply with the results of @entity24 's expenditure of over $ 4 trillion and nearly 7,000 @entity18 lives in @entity26 and @entity27 over the past decade			1
some say @entity2 's story is sui generis : something that could only happen in that time and place			1
but its remarkable performance has less to do with miraculous conditions than with @entity6 's model of disciplined , visionary leadership			1
leaders of other aspiring - to - develop nations , and even the @entity18 , should take pages from @entity6 's playbook to address current challenges			1
we know many of @entity6 's lessons on the role of government leadership in development because my co-authors and i asked him directly two years ago to reflect on them -- points we captured in our book , @entity6 : the grand master 's insights on @entity54 , the @entity18 , and the @entity55			1
first , @entity6 insisted that governance was first and foremost about results			1
in his words , " the acid test of any legal system is not the greatness or the grandeur of its ideal concepts , but whether , in fact , it is able to produce order and justice			2
" about the core purposes of government , he was crystal clear			2
in terms @entity18 's founding fathers would recognize , he believed that " the ultimate test of the value of a political system is whether it helps that society establish conditions which improve the standard of living for the majority of its people , plus enabling the maximum of personal freedoms compatible with the freedoms of others in society			2
" second , superior performance requires superior leadership			2
@entity6 demanded of leaders both intellectual and moral superiority			1
contrary to modern western democratic theory that emphasizes citizens ' participation in governance , his views were closer to @entity97 's conception of the " guardians , " or @entity54 's historical mandarins			2
good government requires most of all leaders who put the public good unquestionably above their own personal interests			1
he was disappointed by many of his counterparts who failed that test			0
third , successful societies guarantee strict equality of opportunity for all individuals , but are realistic about the fact that this will yield substantial inequalities in outcomes			0
for @entity6 , the essence of a successful society was intense competition on a level playing field that allows each individual to achieve his or her maximum			1
few things offended him more than denial of equality of opportunity on the basis of caste ( @entity125 ) , class ( @entity127 ) , race ( the @entity18 during segregation ) , sex , or other irrelevant attributes			0
as he put it , the leader 's objective was to " build up a society in which people will be rewarded not according to the amount of property they own , but according to their active contribution to society in physical or mental labor			0
" fourth , about democracy , particularly @entity144 liberal democracy , @entity6 had serious reservations			1
in part , this attitude stemmed from his own experience , but it also reflected a deeper philosophical aversion to ideologies			0
as he liked to say , " the acid test is performance , not promises			0
the millions dispossessed in @entity154 care not and know not of theory			0
they want a better life			0
they want a more equal , just society			0
" @entity6 enjoyed engaging @entity18 critics who insisted that without democracy @entity2 could not develop an advanced economy			1
in contrast , he argued that what most countries needed was more " discipline , " rather than democracy			0
he noted that the @entity18 had been building democracy and giving aid to the @entity168 for over a century			0
but , he asked , how many people from @entity2 sought to leave it for the @entity168 ? many people in the @entity168 , he noted , wanted to move to @entity2			1
on one occasion , with a broad smile , he continued , " and you will notice that since the @entity176 and the @entity177 , the @entity18 system has not functioned even for the @entity18			0
" fifth , which leaders did he most admire ? from the recent past , he focused on three : @entity180 , @entity181 , and @entity182			2
" @entity180 , because he had tremendous guts ; @entity181 , because he changed @entity54 from a broken - backed state , which would have imploded like the @entity185 , into what it is today ; and " @entity182 , because any other person would have given up			2
" on the current scene , the leader who impressed him most was the new president of @entity54 , @entity189			0
as he said just before @entity189 took office : " i would put him in @entity194 's class of persons			0
a person with enormous emotional stability who does not allow his personal misfortunes or sufferings to affect his judgment			0
in a word , he is impressive			0
" as @entity54 's leaders attempt to follow in @entity6 's footsteps in building a @entity207 led nation that overtook the @entity18 last year in @entity208 ( measured by @entity209 ) to become the world 's largest economy , and democratic @entity125 seems poised to grow at rates that will compete with @entity54 , we can reflect on lessons from @entity6 and place our bets			1
governing a nation in which two of every three citizens believe their country is headed in the wrong direction -- and have believed so under @entity221 and @entity222 presidents for all of the 21st century -- @entity18 leaders should ask whether it is time to focus on the acid test of performance rather than the litmus test of ideology .			2

in @entity2 , @entity6 had remarkable success in creating a *prosperous* modern state
his lessons should prove *instructive* to other leaders in a time of great *instability* , writes @entity237
