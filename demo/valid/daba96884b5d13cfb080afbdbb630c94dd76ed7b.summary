the attack on @entity1 , the @entity2 ambassador to @entity3 , allegedly by a knife - wielding @entity3 progressive activist at a breakfast meeting in @entity6 , was a rare and shocking reminder of the ongoing conflict that continues to divide the @entity10			1
despite the ever - present backdrop of inter-korean tensions , security in downtown @entity6 is typically quite relaxed			2
but on thursday morning local time , the alleged assailant , who has been tied to @entity3 nationalist and anti- @entity2 protests , reportedly shouted his opposition to annual @entity2 - @entity3 joint military exercises and called for @entity3 reunification as he cut the ambassador on the face and hand with a 10 - inch knife			1
this breakfast meeting with @entity1 was taking place at a building directly across the street from the @entity29 in @entity6			1
and the scene was probably not too different from a similar breakfast meeting i attended with the ambassador at a downtown hotel only a week before the attack			0
@entity1 moved freely without a security detail or security screenings at the entrance to the venue , and was accompanied by only one or two embassy staff			2
indeed , even since 9/11 , it is relatively easy to enter most large buildings in downtown @entity6 , and security procedures have been generally perfunctory			0
in part this is because direct confrontations between @entity3 citizens and @entity2 government representatives in @entity3 have been rare , and violent political attacks are unusual			1
true , there have been periodic group protests against the @entity2 military presence in @entity3 or against @entity2 policy			1
but these protests have generally been conducted peacefully , a far cry from the environment of the 1980s , when pro-democracy protesters against a then - authoritarian @entity3 government attacked and burned @entity2 government facilities			1
yet although downtown @entity6 has been relatively safe and public security has often been lax , violent attacks on public figures in @entity3 are in fact not unprecedented			1
the attack on @entity1 brings to mind a may 2006 attack by a knife - wielding assailant on @entity68 , @entity3 's current president , while she was campaigning in local elections in @entity70			2
( her calm demeanor despite receiving a facial laceration contributed to her reputation as a politician and future president who is cool in the midst of a crisis			0
) the attack on @entity79 was n't the only time the dangers inherent in @entity3 's lax security environment have been exposed : back in 2008 , a lone arsonist burned to the ground @entity6 's unguarded @entity83 , or @entity85 , a @entity3 cultural treasure			2
and of course , there is the backdrop of the ongoing @entity91 confrontation , which plays out within @entity3 democracy in the form of a bitter confrontation between progressive and conservative factions			0
there is speculation that some members of @entity3 's progressive movement have ties with @entity101 , and some of them have allegedly been somewhat willing to foment violence to stir up conflict within @entity3 society			0
most recently , some members of @entity3 's left - leaning @entity106 , which had won seats in @entity3 's @entity108 , were disbarred and convicted of plotting a violent insurrection , leading to the dissolution of the party itself			0
and while this hard - core group represents a fringe element within @entity3 society , it still remains active in part due to @entity101 ideological and financial support			0
all this said , the overwhelming initial @entity3 public response to the attack on @entity1 has been one of outrage , condemnation and sympathy			1
indeed , far from revealing gaps in the @entity2 - @entity3 alliance or fomenting discord over whether joint military exercises should move forward , the incident is likely to strengthen @entity3 feelings of support for the alliance with the @entity2			2
still , the incident also serves as a reminder that even in the most seemingly safe and pro-american environments around the world , there is a risk that some zealous critics of @entity2 policy may resort to violence against official @entity2 representatives overseas			0
and that 's especially so in regions such as the @entity10 , where longstanding tensions still cast a shadow over security considerations .			0
