i think back to 56 years ago : what if ? if my father had not been brave and hungry for a better future in @entity6 , there would be one fewer public administrator , one fewer third grade teacher and one fewer student in medical school in my family			1
had so many young people not given their youth , their energy , their strength and their love for this country , the @entity6 we know would not exist			1
i owe the @entity6 i know to my father and the many men that toiled long ago in the fields of our past			1
i owe my success to my father @entity26 , mother @entity27 and countless others that dreamed of a better tomorrow			1
they dreamed of a better tomorrow never knowing if they would reap the slightest of benefits from their hard work			2
today i stand as a testimony to that dream			0
as a teenager , my father left his life of poverty in @entity40 for the promise of a new life in the @entity6 in 1959			1
the hard , physical work of picking crops in the fields of @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 , earned him less than a dollar a day , once room and board was subtracted			1
the @entity53 program granted him a work visa and when he finished the program , he began his path to citizenship			1
my father did not complete any formal education past fourth grade			2
in that era in @entity40 , you had to pay for school past a certain grade and my father 's family could n't afford it			1
he was limited to menial work and low wages			2
unlike my father , i was n't born into a life destined for backbreaking labor			1
my dad brought us into a world with endless possibilities			0
the sky was truly the limit and for the first time in his life , my father had hope -- for us			1
our upbringing was humble , but my parents provided for all 12 of us children			1
they taught each and every one of us the importance of education			0
our childhood was filled with the joys of love , laughter and belief in @entity91			0
my father created paradise in a modest , two - bedroom home in the inner city of @entity95 , @entity48			1
our eggs came fresh every morning from the miniature chickens we raised			0
we were raised to live off the land , just like our father did as a younger man			2
we had a goat , a turkey , a potbelly pig , ducks , geese and chickens			0
many of my fondest memories were of feeding and tending to our animals			0
one would assume that we lived on a farm			0
but balancing a life of dual identities was not an easy feat for either my siblings or me			2
i recall having to wake up early on sunday mornings to feed the chickens and collect the eggs , while my friends were going to the zoo , water park or the mall			0
when mondays came around , i dreaded talking about what i did that weekend			0
i did n't want to be judged , so i always made something up			2
the frustration of not being able to fit in gave way when i started getting positive feedback at school			0
i was outperforming my peers in @entity129 and writing , and i was finally getting recognition by my teachers and classmates			0
i felt that i finally was doing something like everyone else			0
i decided to take a chance and apply for college			0
i started at the @entity138 at @entity95 in fall 2002 and graduated with a bachelor 's degree in @entity129 and a master 's in public administration			2
i was the first in my family to get a college degree -- i 'm the seventh out of 12 children			1
all of my siblings after me went to college and today we have a public administrator , a teacher and a medical school student in the family			0
now , i work in an urban school district as a site coordinator for the federal initiative @entity157			2
the program sets out to make a college education a reality for underrepresented students and communities experiencing high poverty			2
i work to remove those barriers so that every one of my students has a chance at a life like the one that was given to me by my parents			1
i have given myself to a life of service			0
i am now responsible for helping many young children reach their potential and live a life our ancestors could only dream of			1
and i am the proud son of an immigrant			0
