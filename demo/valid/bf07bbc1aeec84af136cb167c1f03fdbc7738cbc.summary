for four years , @entity0 called the @entity3 's @entity2 his home			1
he walked its halls , bunked in its rooms , held office as one of its leaders , considered his fraternity brothers his dearest friends			0
he was proud to be @entity2			2
now that pride is tainted			0
a video shot this saturday of party - bound shows @entity2 members clapping , pumping their fists and chanting in unison : " there will never be a ni * * * * @entity2 , " they sing			2
" you can hang him from a tree , but he can never sign with me			0
" these young men are talking about him , @entity0 said			2
that 's because not only is he an @entity2 alumni , he is also @entity31			1
how do you make sense of the fact that those behind these hateful words wore the same pledge pins , occupied the same house , preached " the same motto that i hold dear to my heart " as @entity0 did ? " i could n't look at myself , " he said , " still claiming to be that			1
" since the video surfaced sunday , students have been expelled and @entity2 's @entity3 chapter has shut down			1
the episode has left @entity0 disgusted , horrified that members of a fraternity that once welcomed him could espouse such hatred			1
students expelled over racist chant " i do n't know what happened to the culture of my home , " he told @entity1 on tuesday			1
" that is not my home			0
they are not my brothers			0
" while the @entity3 frat has never had a lot of black members , that did n't matter to @entity0 when he joined in 2001			1
@entity2 was where he forged lifelong friendships , where he and others grew into men			2
" we were becoming something while i was there , " he said			0
" something that i do n't think these kids grasped			0
... i do n't think they know what it means to be a brother of any fraternity , let alone mine			0
" @entity0 does n't believe the racist chant was an isolated incident , not given how many on the bus seemingly sang it so easily and enthusiastically			1
nor does he think that only those leading the chant deserve punishment			0
just as easily as one person could have started it , someone else could have called for it to stop			0
that 's what @entity0 thinks that his own fraternity brothers would 've done , whether he was around or not			1
they understood the importance of stepping up to say : " this is n't right , this is n't what i stand for , this is n't gentlemanly , this is n't even human , " he said			0
" that 's what being an @entity2 is			1
" " my pledge class ... would n't let that happen , " he said			0
" and i do n't know what 's happened to ( the @entity2 chapter ) since then			1
" many members of that pledge class , as well others who he knew from @entity2 , have reached out to @entity0 in recent days by text , phone , email and @entity108			1
he knows he is not alone , including in his support for disbanding @entity3 's @entity2 chapter			1
" that entire house has accepted the culture that accepts that song , those words , that imagery , " @entity0 said			2
" so the whole house has to be punished			2
" his former frat brothers are different from him , of course			1
their skin color would n't have stopped them from getting into @entity2 if the twisted chant reflected reality			2
still , @entity0 feels their pain is real and sincere			2
those on this weekend 's video may not be his brothers , but those he knew from 2001 to 2005 still are			1
" i do n't think that they can fully encompass the pain and betrayal that i feel , " @entity0 said of his white friends from the fraternity			0
" but by holding me so close in their life , they know that their brother was hurt			0
" " so it 's a thing they 're feeling in their family			0
i 'm family to them			0

@entity0 was in @entity3 's @entity2 chapter from 2001 to 2005
he 's disgusted by the racist chant tied to the frat ; " the whole house needs to be punished "
while those *involved* are " not my brothers , " @entity0 calls his former frat brothers " family "
