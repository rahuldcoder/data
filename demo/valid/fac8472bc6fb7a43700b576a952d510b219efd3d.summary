last month announced plans to remove all artificial flavors and colors from its chocolate candies , it understandably made headlines			1
according to the company , by the end of 2015 , none of a group of 250 chocolate products including @entity12 and @entity13 will contain artificial flavors or colors such as red # 40 or yellow # 5			1
with the expectation that these chemicals will also disappear from the company 's other candies , it looks like the end of the use of artificial flavors and colors in anything but the cheapest food products			1
if that proves to be the case , it will be a welcome shift			0
@entity1 intends to advertise the reformulated products with a " no artificial flavors or colors " claim on package labels			1
if sales of the " no artificial " candies grow as expected , the company will surely extend the removal to all of its other colored and flavored food products			1
after all , @entity1 's international parent company -- and the company 's competitors -- will have to take notice and find ways to remove these chemicals from all their product lines			1
it accounts for a quarter of the $ 100 billion in annual revenues of the more than century - old , privately held parent corporation , which itself is the largest food company in the world			0
this move surely will not only reverberate through the candy industry , but also affect every other major food company			0
in substituting natural for artificial flavors and colors , @entity1 is responding to what its customers are saying			1
the company 's own research indicates that @entity63 prefer their beloved candy brands to be free of artificial flavors and colors , while other surveys find majorities of respondents saying that artificial chemical additives negatively influence their buying decisions			1
7 chemicals in your food @entity1 is also responding to decades of complaints from consumer advocates about the potential health risks of these chemicals , especially the dyes			1
studies in experimental animals have linked high doses of food dyes to health problems , among them organ damage , cancer , birth defects , and allergic reactions			0
in humans , studies link food dyes to hyperactivity and other behavioral problems in young children			0
the credibility of these studies and their implications for human health remain hotly debated			0
in the 1970s , for example , @entity96 , a physician in @entity97 , suggested that food additives caused children to become hyperactive			2
much of the evidence for the " @entity102 hypothesis " rested on anecdotal reports by parents , whereas double - blind , controlled clinical trials produced contradictory results			0
on the basis of current evidence , some artificial food dyes have been banned , while others remain in use despite suggestions that they too might be harmful			2
but the makers and users of food dyes argue that the chemicals are safe at current levels of usage			0
as a result of all this , and in the absence of convincing evidence of their safety , the advocacy group @entity119 has campaigned since the 1970s to remove food dyes and other chemicals from foods , and has continued to petition the @entity129 to ban them			2
@entity130 removing artificial dyes from some mac and cheese the opposing views complicate the regulatory status of food dyes			2
but after one clinical trial reported that dyes induce hyperactivity in half the children studied , the @entity138 government asked companies to stop using most food colors ; the @entity144 requires a warning notice on many foods made with them			2
in the @entity63 , the @entity129 does not permit artificial food dyes to be used unless the manufacturers can meet safety requirements			2
but the amounts of these substances in the country 's food supply have greatly increased in recent years -- soft drinks , breakfast cereals , frozen desserts and even salad dressings all contain artificial coloring agents			2
true , the @entity129 considers a dye to be safe if there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from its intended use			0
but that standard is vague enough to cause concern			0
given the unresolved scientific questions , it is reasonable to ask why artificial colors have to be in foods at all			1
from the standpoint of manufacturers , such additives are essential for covering up and hiding unattractive colors in processed foods			1
to the public , red candy seems to taste better than the drab variety			0
and while natural colors exist , they are less stable or more expensive to produce			0
but for @entity1 to have taken the action that it has , the company must have found substitutes it can live with			1
and appealing to consumers ' preference for " natural " makes good business sense			0
the truth is that whether artificial colors do or do not cause health problems in adults or children , they are there strictly for cosmetic purposes			1
for that reason alone , getting rid of them is a good idea .			0
