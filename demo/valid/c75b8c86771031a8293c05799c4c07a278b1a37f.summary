with its snow - capped mountains and picturesque deserted hamlets , the @entity0 , where a @entity2 jet crashed tuesday , is a stunningly beautiful but sparsely populated spot			1
tiny villages are scattered along the gorge , which rises from the apple and pear orchards and the gray stone riverbed of the valley floor to heights of more than 2,000 meters ( 1.2 miles ) above sea level			0
many of these villages , which were bustling communities in the 19th century , now lie abandoned or survive with just a handful of inhabitants			0
one dead - end road , the @entity20 , winds its way through @entity22 , passing churches and a campsite that offers a peaceful retreat for summer hikers			2
but the remoteness -- which appeals to small numbers of holidaymakers looking to ski in winter or take restorative walks through the green hills in the warmer months -- may make reaching the wreckage of the @entity2 plane difficult			2
@entity34 , director of the tourist office in @entity35 , told @entity37 newspaper @entity36 the crash occurred in a particularly steep spot on the @entity41 mountain , and may have been witnessed by skiers on the area 's slopes			1
" there is no access by road ; emergency crews are coming in by air , using helicopters , " he said			2
capt. @entity51 from the @entity52 in the nearby town of @entity54 told @entity5 the aircraft was lying in " difficult terrain			1
" @entity57 , the president of the tourism office at the @entity60 ski resort , said she heard the plane crash and called the police and the local government office to find out what had happened			1
" it was about 11 ( a.m. ) here			0
i was outside the garage , and we heard a strange noise , " she said			0
" and at first we thought it was an avalanche , but it was strange at this time because it was 11			0
... we did n't know what			0
" her husband was skiing nearby and saw a plane flying at low altitude , she said			0
@entity37 president @entity79 warned " it will take some hours for the emergency services to reach the crash site			1
" photographs posted on @entity84 hours after the plane disappeared from radar showed helicopters preparing to take off , and emergency vehicles lining up ready to receive the victims ' remains			0
the bodies of those on board the plane are expected to be taken to the gymnasium at the local high school in @entity96 les @entity95 , some 10 kilometers ( 6 miles ) from the crash site , which will be used as a temporary morgue			1
@entity37 police in the region have pleaded with locals and visitors to stay away from the site , urging them " not to clutter the roads , " leaving them clear for emergency vehicles .			1

resident tells @entity5 she *initially* mistook the noise from the crash for an avalanche
crash site in the @entity0 is remote , difficult to reach
single mountain road leads to area ; police urge *people* to leave it clear
