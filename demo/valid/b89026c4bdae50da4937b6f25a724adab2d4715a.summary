the emotional two - hour season finale of @entity3 's " @entity2 " went full circle from the show 's roots to the future , reminding @entity8 why they fell in love with the musical sitcom			1
few would disagree that the show 's first season was its best , winning over a dedicated fan base who stuck with the show through an uneven six seasons and the loss of star @entity18			1
for its final episode friday night , the show that made it cool to join the high school glee club focused on core characters introduced in the first season			1
the first hour of friday 's season finale , aptly titled " 2009 , " was a retelling of the first episode , which included a memorable performance of @entity30 's " @entity29 " by the original members of @entity33 's glee club			1
instead of telling it again through @entity37 's perspective , the finale showed what led the other characters to join @entity40 , culminating in an edited version of the performance that packed an emotional punch by featuring @entity18			2
the second hour brought us to the present day , with @entity45 passing @entity40 on to @entity46 so he can take charge of @entity48 as a fine arts school			0
we saw the characters ' dreams come true in a requisite flash - forward to the future : @entity54 ( now married to @entity55 ) wins a @entity56 ; @entity57 sings with @entity58 ; @entity59 and @entity60 are successful @entity62 stars ; and most amazing of all , vice president @entity63 starts her second term in the @entity66 administration			2
the entirety of @entity40 , past and present , gathered one last time in the auditorium , now named after @entity37			0
they sang one last song before we saw a quote from @entity37 summing up the show : " see the world not as it is , but as it should be			0
