one - year - old @entity0 lives almost entirely in the dark			1
she was born in @entity3 , as the crisis in eastern @entity5 was taking hold last year			1
now , she and her parents stay in a putrid cellar that also serves as a bomb shelter , on the outskirts of the city			2
they are usually packed in tight with dozens of other people			2
it takes torchlight to see their faces : children , women , men and the elderly , sitting in a sea of filth			1
there is no water and no toilet , just buckets overflowing in a space where people have to eat and sleep			2
this is the world @entity0 has experienced so far , the place where she is having to learn to talk and walk			2
it 's an extraordinary contrast with just a few years before , when @entity3 was a thriving city that helped host the @entity33			2
now the streets are empty and most of the shops are closed			2
the shelling is so incessant that our driver tells me it feels like having techno music playing constantly in the background			2
i hear a lot about the politics of the @entity5 conflict : which leader has said what to whom , the provenance of arms , the big picture			1
what is missing from the debate is the people -- it is ordinary citizens who are suffering the most			2
behind the grand headlines , there are children in desperate need who are suffering now and who will continue to suffer the consequences of the crisis in years to come			1
around 1.7 million children are affected by the conflict in @entity5 -- including more than a thousand who are seeking refuge in bomb shelters in @entity3			1
these are not modern bunkers			0
they are freezing holes , normally in the cellar of a house , which are simply unfit for human habitation			0
if a building collapses in a bombing , everyone will be buried			0
that is why in @entity81 , for example , aid organizations are bringing body bags with them			0
they have seen friends and relatives die			0
they are afraid to even step outside of the cellars , as they fear they will never come back			0
on a recent @entity91 aid convoy into @entity3 , @entity89 delivered more than 27 metric tons of essential hygiene supplies , education kits and drinking water			0
we made sure we prioritized the neediest children -- those in underground bomb shelters as well as those who are living with disabilities , who have been orphaned or who are affected by @entity102			1
but this is not the sort of childhood one would imagine for 21st century @entity5			1
in a country where children are too often institutionalized , the ongoing crisis can only exacerbate the problem			1
social systems are collapsing and children are bearing the brunt			1
in an orphanage for babies born to hiv - positive women , we found there were no tests to check if babies were @entity102 positive or not , let alone the necessary medication to treat them			0
these babies are in limbo -- nobody wants to adopt them and their status is not known			0
this area of @entity5 had one of the highest level of @entity102 before the conflict began			1
now we just have no idea how bad the situation has become			0
elsewhere , we found children in detention in @entity3 who had n't seen relatives in more than a year			1
in a center for children with disabilities , mothers told us they had no insulin for their diabetic sons and daughters			1
we have to help these children now , but also plan for when the fighting stops -- people will need new homes , and we 'll have to deal with unexploded ordnance and the terrible psychological damage on children , among other things			1
this is not a case of delivering aid now and that 's the end of the story			0
we need to commit for the long term			0
until then , though , the needs are huge and resources are scarce			0
in december , @entity89 called for additional support of $ 32.4 million to scale up its humanitarian response to address the urgent needs of children and families in conflict - affected areas in @entity5			1
today the needs are even greater			0
in the basement shelter , @entity0 's parents cradle her tightly			0
they ask me the same question again and again : " when will it all be over ? "			0
