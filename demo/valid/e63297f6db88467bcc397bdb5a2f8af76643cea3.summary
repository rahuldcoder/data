they say time and tide wait for no man , as @entity4 discovered at the @entity5 in @entity6 when he complained he had been decisively rushed after being put on the clock in the closing stages of his dramatic defeat			1
the @entity10 -- who lost to defending champion @entity11 by one stroke -- was ticked off that he and playing partner @entity13 were subjected to time constraints from the 15th hole onwards because of alleged slow play sunday			1
under competition rules , players are put on the clock if they have fallen behind the allotted time for each hole and well behind the preceding group of players			2
once the measure is imposed , shots are timed and players given a one - stroke penalty for the second shot -- but not the first -- on which they are found to have taken too long			0
@entity4 said the decision " got to me , and obviously i was rushing " as he three - putted both that hole and the 16th , opening the door for @entity33 to seal the title with a round of 66 crowned by a long - range putt on the final green			1
officials at the @entity41 course said @entity4 and @entity42 's had been the slowest pairing of the day sunday			2
but the frustrated 38 - year - old @entity10 said he " could not see the point " of being put on the clock			1
" when someone is sitting there with a stopwatch it affects you a little bit , " he explained , accusing officials of " influencing , potentially , the outcome of this tournament towards the end			1
" " i did n't really have much time to look at my putt [ on the 15th ] and rushed that one a little bit , the first one , and three - putted , " the @entity59 website quoted him as saying			1
" @entity13 got a bad time on his second shot on 16 , and again i kind of rushed my putting on 16 and three - putted that one			1
that 's really what cost me the tournament , those two three - putts on 15 and 16			2
" we might have been a couple minutes out , for sure -- but then again it 's normally not the quickest when you 're playing in the last group			0
" [ there are ] more people , more movement			0
you have to back off every now and then for some mobile phones and stuff like that			0
" the @entity59 was not immediately available for comment about @entity4 's remarks			2
@entity4 told reporters that " it 's hard when you do n't feel like you can take the time you want , " adding that he was " disappointed with the rules official for pushing us up late in the round for no obvious reason			1
" and he was unimpressed when told that part of the reason for the imposition of the ticking clock could have been a desire to complete play before live tv coverage came to an end at 18.00 local time			0
" i thought we were here to play golf , not to finish at 6pm , " he snapped			0
meanwhile , a delighted @entity11 was left to reflect on the 17ft birdie putt on the final green that took him to the title			0
" you watch tournaments on tv where guys make putts like that to win and everybody goes nuts -- it 's cool to close one out like that , " he said .			0
