by the time @entity2 read about @entity3 , a little boy who got a battery - powered robotic arm last summer , she had made peace with her son @entity7 's limb difference			1
her premature baby had been born with his right arm tangled in amniotic bands			1
at a week old , doctors amputated his dead forearm and hand			2
they were afraid his body would be become infected and he would die			2
@entity2 mourned her boy 's missing arm for years but , in time , embraced her son as he was			2
@entity7 also learned to adapt			2
they tried a couple of prosthetics when he was younger and each time the toddler abandoned the false limb within months			2
" his main interest was to create a shocking response from onlookers by pulling it off in the grocery store , " @entity2 wrote on @entity24			2
in truth , she had been more concerned about getting him therapy for his autism - related delays -- the limb difference was secondary			2
so when a friend shared a story from the " @entity37 " with @entity7 in mind , about a team of @entity41 ( @entity41 ) students and graduates that made an electronic arm for 6 - year - old @entity3 using a three - dimensional printer on campus , @entity2 was defensive			1
" he does n't need this , " she thought			2
her fifth - grader had a different reaction : " i want one of these robot arms ! " @entity2 remembers @entity7 telling her and her husband			2
" i could ride a bike ! i might even be able to paddle a kayak ! " there were other things the 12 - year - old boy said he would do if he had two hands			2
dance with a pretty girl with one hand on her back and the other leading			2
stuff she had n't really thought about but he clearly had			2
@entity2 got in touch with the @entity68 students through @entity69 , an online volunteer organization started by @entity72 research scientist @entity71 to match people who have 3 - d printers with children in need of hands and arms			1
the organization creates and shares bionic arm designs for free download at @entity83 that can be assembled for as little as $ 20 to $ 50			0
middle and high school student groups and girl and @entity87 troops are among those donating their time and materials to assemble limbs for kids and give them to recipients for free			1
the @entity41 team , which operates a nonprofit called @entity96 , is special because it 's the only group in the @entity98 volunteer network making electronic arms			1
@entity101 arms are mechanical , which presents a challenge for children without elbows			1
with mechanical arms , the child opens and closes their hand by bending their elbow			0
the students came up with the idea for an electronic arm with a muscle sensor that allows the child to open and close their hand by flexing their bicep			1
" it 's really just a step - by - step process of solving problems			0
the first problem we solved was : how do we make the hand move electronically ? and then : how do we attach this arm to a child ? " said sophomore @entity124			0
" it 's just one problem after another we keep solving			0
that 's what engineering is all about			1
" the @entity133 estimates about 1,500 babies in the @entity135 are born with upper limb deformities each year			0
@entity138 statistics are n't available for the number of children with amputations , such as @entity7			1
the @entity41 project started when @entity143 , an engineering doctoral student , heard a story on the radio about one of the inventors of the @entity98 printed hand			1
he got involved with @entity69 and met @entity3 , a local boy teased because of his missing arm , and set about designing a robotic replacement			0
they gave it to @entity3 for free			0
" my mother taught us that we 're supposed to help change the world , " @entity143 said at the time			1
" we 're supposed to help make it better			0
" the students were blown away by what happened after that			1
the " @entity37 " and other national news outlets featured stories about @entity3 and @entity143 , and then they got international attention			0
families in more than 25 countries have asked the @entity41 students to help their children			1
in february , @entity168 highlighted the team in a social media campaign celebrating students using technology to change the world			1
each electronic limb takes about 30 to 50 hours to make and assemble			0
the students use the printer in the school 's manufacturing lab and cover the cost of materials -- about $ 350 -- through donations			1
@entity124 got involved with the design of @entity3 's hand because @entity143 knew he was good with electronics			0
" he bribed me with some pulled pork sandwiches			0
i went over to his house and helped him out with electronics , " he said			0
" i found out he was working on an arm , and i thought that was the coolest thing in the world			1
" eventually @entity143 moved to @entity193 for a @entity195 scholarship and left @entity124 in charge of running the operations in @entity68			1
@entity124 says they ask every family about the child 's favorite color , superhero and interests , so the new limb can " not just be a piece of plastic ... but be a part of them			0
" as they 've designed the bionics , they 've learned that kids do n't necessarily want to blend in			0
children have requested colorful designs inspired by superheroes , @entity217 's " @entity216 , " and in @entity7 's case , the blue - skinned men from " @entity220			1
" for @entity222 , the group upgraded @entity3 's plain vanilla white arm to a new one resembling @entity224 from " @entity225			0
" " we quickly found out this is much less about fitting in and feeling normal , and much more about expressing yourself , " @entity124 said			0
" there 's a large aspect of being artistic and being creative			0
" the team has made electronic arms for five children and are working with three more kids including @entity7			1
he traveled with his mom to @entity41 last week and practiced flexing his muscle to make the hand open and close			0
he expects to get fitted with his new arm later this month			0
his mom , @entity239 , was most excited about seeing @entity7 being celebrated for who he is			0
" the adoration of college students was an affirmation that money ca n't buy			1
he was wrapped in the joy of leading and advising students on how to help children like himself , " she wrote in her @entity24			1
" @entity7 felt like he was making a difference for himself and other children			1
" as they got ready to leave the campus , her son told her he ca n't wait to see what he will accomplish with his new arm			0
and someday , he said , he wants to go to @entity41 and help other kids like him .			0

around the world , volunteers with @entity98 printers are making limbs for children .
meet some @entity68 engineering students changing the world .
