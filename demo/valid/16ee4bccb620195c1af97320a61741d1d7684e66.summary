@entity1 , @entity2 a @entity5 jet carrying 224 people skidded off a runway wednesday morning at @entity1 's airport , forcing those on board to evacuate and effectively shutting down @entity2 's lone international airport , authorities said			1
the @entity12 's crew first tried landing the plane around 7 a.m. wednesday ( 8:30 p.m. et tuesday ) , getting very close to a runway but not touching down , according to passenger @entity15			1
that was followed by an announcement that the aircraft could n't land due to poor visibility			0
about 45 minutes later , though , the crew tried again			0
this time , the @entity5 plane did get on the ground but it did n't stay on the runway , according to airport officials			2
the aircraft skidded off , screeching to a stop with its nose pitched down			0
pictures showed passengers and crew going down evacuation slides and walking through heavy fog			1
despite the rough landing , there were no reports of serious injuries , according to a @entity5 spokesman			1
still , the incident did manage to knock out air travel in and out of the @entity40 , the only way in for foreigners wanting to explore @entity43 and other nearby peaks in the @entity45			0
that 's because part of the now - immobile @entity12 was covering a section of the runway			1
@entity2 does n't have the heavy - duty machinery required to move it , said @entity52 , the head of the mountainous @entity55 nation 's @entity53			2
and large cargo planes that could be brought in to help with the job have nowhere to land now			0
having them land anywhere else in @entity2 is n't an option either			0
instead , authorities are exploring possibly flying in needed equipment to @entity65 and then driving it over to @entity2			0
until then , all international flights into @entity1 have been called off until further notice			1
that includes 40 arriving and 40 departing flights canceled wednesday			2
journalist @entity72 reported from @entity1 , @entity3 's @entity71 reported from @entity65 and @entity3 's @entity73 wrote this story from @entity75 .			2
