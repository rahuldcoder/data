@entity1 it does n't matter how many times @entity4 prime minister @entity3 now says he still wants a two - state solution with the @entity6			1
the @entity7 is refusing to take him at his word			0
" we take him at his word when he said that it would n't happen during his prime ministership , and so that 's why we 've got to evaluate what other options are available to make sure that we do n't see a chaotic situation in the region , " president @entity9 said in an interview with the @entity11 published saturday			1
these are the president 's first public comments since @entity3 's party captured the most seats in tuesday 's parliamentary election			2
@entity3 has said in at least three post-election interviews that he still believes in @entity6 statehood , despite his pre-election flip - flop on the issue in what experts called a desperate appeal for conservative votes			2
only on thursday , two days after the election , did president @entity9 congratulate @entity3 by phone on his victory			0
@entity7 press secretary @entity37 declined to say whether @entity3 clarified his position on the two - state policy during that phone call			1
but @entity9 told the prime minister that the @entity42 would " reassess " aspects of its relationship with @entity4 after @entity3 's earlier provocative statements opposing the creation of a @entity6 state			1
administration officials have said the @entity42 is now considering signing on to a @entity50 resolution which supports a @entity6 state			0
regarding comments @entity3 made tuesday about @entity54 @entity4 voters going to the polls " in droves " -- comments described by some as racist -- @entity9 told @entity11 that that kind of " rhetoric " was " contrary to what is best of @entity4 's traditions			1
that although @entity4 was founded based on the historic @entity63 homeland and the need to have a @entity63 homeland , @entity4 democracy has been premised on everybody in the country being treated equally and fairly			0
" @entity9 added : " if that is lost , then i think that not only does it give ammunition to folks who do n't believe in a jewish state , but it also i think starts to erode the name of democracy in the country			0
" @entity42 house speaker @entity77 , who invited @entity3 to address that controversial joint meeting of @entity79 earlier this month , plans to visit @entity4 at the end of the month			2
while the speaker 's office says the trip was planned well before the prime minister 's re-election , it will come around the deadline for an initial nuclear deal between @entity89 , the @entity42 and other world powers .			0
