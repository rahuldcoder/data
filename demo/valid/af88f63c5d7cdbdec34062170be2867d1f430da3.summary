and then there are superyachts for " ladies			1
" introducing @entity6 , the 80 - meter gold and crystal - encrusted superyacht described as a floating " boudoir for women , " by its female designer			1
" there will not be any boy 's toys -- such as pool tables or beer kegs -- on board , " @entity19 designer , @entity18 , told @entity1			2
" but there will be a fantastic spa with a beauty center , large mirrors , and huge wardrobes , " she said of the concept yacht , which she claims is the first designed specifically for women			1
@entity18 came up with plans for the five - deck @entity29 because " i felt , as a lady , it was my duty to design something especially for us , where we can feel a woman 's touch			2
" there will only be off - white , ivory , and cream colors			2
all surrounded by furs , silk , gold , pearls , crystals , live music , aromatics and flowers , " she added			2
not that all women are on board with @entity18 's " warm and romantic " bejeweled boat			1
" i do n't know any woman who lives in a dream world where these things are desirable , " said @entity51 , director of the @entity52 at @entity53			2
" it feels somehow remote , like some sort of little girlish dream , traveling in that eternal pink cloud			0
" @entity18 , who also designs apartment interiors , defended the hyper - feminine yacht , saying : " i do n't know a single woman who does not like flowers and is not dreaming of diamonds			0
" if you get married , the most amazing day in your life , you want to be dressed in an amazing white long dress , looking like a princess , with a gold diamond ring on your finger , around romantic music , happy people , and plenty of flowers			0
" in the ultra-elite world of superyachts , female owners are practically unheard of , but that does n't mean women do n't have a huge influence over the spending of their billionaire partners			1
" in terms of superyacht owners , i 'd say they were upwards of 90 % male , " said @entity84 , of superyacht brokers @entity85			1
" that said , superyachts on the whole are designed for the preferences of a couple -- for their interests , design , style , and taste			1
" and while the person chartering a superyacht is often male , the person in charge of the holiday is often his wife or girlfriend			1
" male or female , @entity84 envisioned few clients looking to buy a " radical , gold yacht " such as @entity18 's			0
" it could be regarded as patronizing -- a bit like @entity112 , where the assumption is that everything has to be pink , " said @entity84			1
earlier this year , plans were revealed for world 's biggest private boat -- the $ 1 billion , 222 meter @entity119			0
and they 're only going to become more lavish , according to @entity84			0
" we 've launched yachts in the last few years that have multiple pools , helipads , a squash court			0
there are few things now a yacht ca n't have , " he said			0
" whereas a jacuzzi was a luxury in the early 2000s , now if you 've got just one , it 's rather frowned upon			0
you need to have a few and you need to have an infinity plunge pool that doubles as a helipad			0
" whether there will also be a market for gender - specific vessels , remains to be seen			0
