at first @entity0 thought he 'd received a spam email			2
the message to the @entity5 physicist was asking for help working out the dynamics of hair , specifically the shape of ponytails			2
@entity0 thought he 'd " won the @entity12 lottery			2
" poised to click delete , he scrolled through the message one more time and discovered it was from global consumer goods giant @entity14			2
@entity15 piqued , he met with a company representative , and the rest , as they say , is history			2
assembling a team of balding physicists , @entity0 set out to tackle the subject , publishing their research in a peer review journal			0
it detailed the fluid mechanics of hair , drawing on a rich seam of scientific observation stretching back to @entity29			0
they even coined a new term : hairodynamics			0
attention from the scientific community soon followed , and within a year they were collecting a @entity36			1
an @entity38 , that is			1
a satirical cousin to the more esteemed @entity41 award , the @entity38 seeks to highlight research that first makes you laugh , then makes you think			1
this year marks their 25th anniversary , so what better time to celebrate the @entity38 ' contribution to the research community ? every year thousands vie for the awards -- " always sourced from the cheapest materials " according to founder @entity49 -- held at @entity50			1
the ceremony is bathos at its finest			0
winners receive their awards from genuine @entity38 laureates , but speeches are curtailed by a screaming girl declaring her boredom			1
each year a cast of professional singers and scientists perform a mini-opera			1
last year 's was set to @entity63 and featured a chorus of microbial bacteria			1
past recipients include a man who dressed up as a polar bear to scare reindeer and a study of homosexual necrophilia among mallard ducks ( commended by @entity49 for " its high literary quality " )			0
however , not all winners can have such high scientific kudos			2
the @entity38 skewered the @entity77 in 2012 , awarding them the @entity78 " for issuing a report about reports about reports that recommends the preparation of a report about the report about reports about reports			1
" you can read it here			0
in 2009 the @entity89 went to @entity90 , then head of @entity92 's @entity91 , for printing a z $ 100 trillion note ( while also printing 1c )			0
last year the @entity94 landed the @entity95 for bringing the country out of recession through the use of prostitutes , drugs and smuggling			2
( the @entity103 government ended up setting a precedent in @entity105 , with the @entity106 soon including the so - called " black economy " in its figures -- national gdp jumped by 5 % that quarter , equivalent to $ 15 billion			0
) as proved by the @entity38 , the line between ridiculous and serious research has always been blurred			1
this is no better reflected than in @entity115 - @entity106 physicist @entity114			0
in 2000 @entity114 scooped the @entity116 for using magnets to levitate frogs			0
ten years later he went on to receive the @entity119 for his " groundbreaking experiments regarding the two - dimensional material graphene			0
" it is hard to say which is the greater achievement			0
@entity49 is currently touring the @entity106 touting the @entity124 , supported by previous winners such as @entity0 and potential candidates like @entity127 , who found fame by conducting a two year study into the homing properties of garden snails ( his modus operandi : throwing them over the garden fence )			1
soon @entity49 will have to settle down and sift through what he predicts will be about 9,000 entries , before the anniversary ceremony on september 17			1
despite his longstanding and much admired pastiche of the @entity38 , he is still yet to be invited to @entity139 for the awards proper			1
asked if he would attend if offered the opportunity , @entity49 demurs , saying " he would n't want to be a distraction			0
" and as for what the @entity36 could learn from his own mischievous creation ? " absolutely nothing			1
" read more from @entity147 , @entity148 : great photos from the world 's smallest satellites so long , transistor : how the ' memristor ' could revolutionize electronics laser procedure can turn brown eyes blue			0

the @entity38 will celebrate their 25th anniversary in september this year
