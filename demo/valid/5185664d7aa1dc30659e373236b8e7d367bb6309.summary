it 's time for leaders in @entity3 and the @entity4 to call off their war of insults before they cause serious , lasting damage			1
heading into prime minister @entity10 's address on tuesday to a joint session of @entity12 , both sides should immediately agree to a cease fire			1
the speech itself is a terrible mistake			1
arranging it without prior consultation with the @entity19 was not only an affront to @entity21 but to the @entity22 itself			0
one would have thought that after all the uproar , @entity10 would have caught a " cold " and postponed , but now that he plans to go ahead , he should at least give a measured , thoughtful address -- not the barn burner for which he is known			2
but let 's be clear : he also deserves a respectful hearing in @entity12 from both sides of the aisle			2
blame for the deterioration in relations is shared here in @entity4 as well as in @entity3			1
this conflict began on a personal level			0
those close to @entity21 and @entity10 say the two men took an instant dislike years ago and have since descended into loathing one another			2
@entity21 , they say , regards @entity10 as headstrong , bombastic and reckless			2
@entity10 sees @entity21 as weak , unreliable and priggish			2
the @entity21 team also accuses @entity10 of timing his @entity12 speech to rally @entity3 voters behind him in elections two weeks away -- @entity10 as @entity46 standing up to the @entity47 -- while @entity10 's team is convinced @entity21 is desperate for a deal to burnish his legacy -- the @entity52 laureate who brought peace			1
each thinks the other endangers the future of the world and each has allowed his top lieutenants to viciously attack the other in the press			0
but in recent months what began as personal antipathy has deepened and widened into a serious split over the best way to head off @entity66 's aggressive push to become a nuclear power			2
the @entity66 threat has long been vexing ; former defense secretary @entity69 once told me it was the toughest problem he saw in nearly a half century serving of distinguished service in national security			2
there are no obvious solutions acceptable to key parties			0
the @entity21 administration believes that a compromise agreement with @entity66 limiting -- but not dismantling -- its nuclear capability is better than to have current talks fall apart , risking an armed showdown			2
the @entity10 government believes the agreement which @entity21 appears ready to accept will let @entity66 eventually wriggle free and build a bomb			1
in truth , there is merit to both points of view -- and the devil here is not only in the details but in the very structure of an agreement			0
as @entity21 believes , a negotiated settlement is far preferable to a possible war or learning to live with a nuclear @entity66			2
but what is alarming not only to @entity3 but to other @entity4 friends in the region -- and rightly so -- is that the @entity4 and its partners in the negotiation with @entity66 ( @entity102 , @entity103 , the @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 ) have made repeated concessions to get an @entity66 signature without getting major concessions in return			1
consider : the @entity4 and @entity3 started down the negotiating path saying publicly that @entity66 must totally dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of punishing economic sanctions against @entity116			1
leaks since then have shown that in pursuit of a deal , the @entity4 is now willing to accept more and more centrifuges in @entity66 -- 6,500 by latest count			1
@entity122 and @entity123 once talked of an agreement that would last at least 20 years			0
â€‹ according to the latest leaks , the agreement may only cover 10 years and then give the @entity66 a chance to bust loose			0
this is only the beginning of a long litany of differences			0
in defense of @entity4 compromises , secretary of state @entity132 makes a persuasive point that a temporary agreement reached 18 months ago containing compromises has worked far better than critics have conceded and therefore , those now at the table deserve a benefit of doubt			0
but administration critics are also right in arguing that the @entity21 administration seems to be betting that if just given a few years grace , an odious regime which sponsors terrorism across the @entity146 will suddenly change spots and become a partner for peace			0
in times past , @entity4 and @entity3 leaders have sometimes had bad blood and still made substantive progress			1
president @entity154 could barely stand @entity3 leader @entity155 but they and @entity157 president @entity156 shaped the @entity159 accords in 1978			0
despite sometimes bitter words during @entity3 's recent dust - up with @entity162 -- especially directed by @entity3 against secretary @entity132 -- @entity21 ensured that @entity3 was well supplied militarily , particularly with the @entity164 missile defense system that saved countless @entity3 lives			1
but today 's rift seems far more perilous			0
it is not only personal but substantive and comes at a moment of spreading turmoil across the @entity146			0
@entity3 should remember that @entity4 is its best friend in a world where @entity172 is once again raising its hideous head			1
the @entity4 should appreciate that for @entity3 , a nuclear @entity66 could pose instant annihilation			1
@entity4 also has @entity176 friends in the @entity146 who have vital interests here -- friends like @entity178 who , if an agreement is weak , will feel compelled to pursue their own bomb , unleashing a lethal arms race			0
this is a moment that demands that leaders in both @entity3 and the @entity4 lower their voices , take their differences indoors and begin restoring broken bonds of trust			1
in private talks , they should work hard finding ways to bridge differences between them , starting with creative proposals coming recently from veteran @entity4 diplomats			0
@entity197 , for example , argues that if the @entity4 could greatly strengthen an inspections regime -- a much bigger team who could go anywhere , any time in @entity66 -- and could enshrine in legislation that @entity66 violations will bring military action , that would go a long way toward allaying opposition fears			1
@entity208 proposes that , drawing upon ideas embraced by president @entity210 in @entity146 negotiations 15 years ago , the @entity4 could enter a formal treaty with @entity3 , voted upon by @entity12 , that would provide a @entity4 " nuclear guarantee " to @entity3 in event of an @entity66 breakout			1
in short , the moment is dire but not hopeless			0
what is clearly needed is a cease fire			0
secretary @entity132 seemed to be pointing in that direction sunday when he said @entity10 is welcome to speak in the @entity4 on tuesday			1
others should now take up the cause , recognizing that our real adversaries are not in @entity123 or @entity122 but among those in @entity116 who support terror and mayhem across the @entity146 .			0

@entity227 : @entity10 's speech is a terrible mistake of his making but he deserves a hearing
the rift in @entity4 - @entity3 relations over @entity66 is serious , needs repair , @entity227 says
