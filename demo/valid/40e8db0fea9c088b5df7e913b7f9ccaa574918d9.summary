@entity1 ever since @entity0 came to power , there have been killings of politicians , of human rights activists , of journalists			1
@entity9 , one of @entity11 's most prominent opposition figures , is only the latest victim			1
the key thing all these crimes have in common is that none of them get properly resolved			0
of course , the @entity17 will issue condemnation and condolences , as it has done over the assassination of @entity9			1
but the killers and the people who ordered the killings do n't usually end up facing justice -- and if you are an opposition politician in @entity11 , or a human rights activist , or a journalist , you will know this			0
if the dangers were n't clear enough , the circumstances of the most recent killing are a stark reminder			0
it was late friday night			0
@entity9 and his girlfriend @entity34 , a @entity36 model , had eaten dinner at plush restaurant on @entity39			1
afterwards , despite the chilly weather , they decided to walk back to his apartment , perhaps to take in the stunning views			0
the @entity17 looks spectacular at night			1
it was on this short journey , in the heart of @entity1 , that the gunman struck , leaving @entity9 dead within sight of the red @entity17 walls -- walls which , by the way , bristle with security cameras			1
in the days since , thousands have made pilgrimage to the place where the outspoken @entity0 critic was shot to pay their respects , leaving a mountain of flowers and personal messages			2
an opposition rally on sunday , which @entity9 was meant to lead , was canceled and replaced with a mourning march past the crime scene			2
it was the biggest pro-opposition rally in the @entity11 capital for years			0
but few who took part could have missed the symbolism , the real message the killers -- whoever they are -- sent by gunning down such a prominent @entity17 critic in the shadow of its towering walls			2
it 's this : if you oppose the @entity17 , if you criticize its power , if you stand for greater democracy and reform , as @entity9 did , this could happen to you too			1
it 's hard to predict what impact this message will have			0
" yet another terrible page has been turned in the history we all share , " wrote @entity83 , the once - jailed oligarch - turned @entity17 critic now in exile			2
" what the next page holds is up to each and every one of us , " he said , commenting on the death of @entity9			2
the statement was issued under the banner " we are not afraid "			0
but many @entity11 i 've spoken to since the killing are , in fact , very afraid			0
and while the hope among opposition activists is that @entity9 's killing may at least invigorate their ranks , one very real possibility is that it will do the exact opposite : further silence an already very quiet minority opposed to the rule of @entity0 .			1
