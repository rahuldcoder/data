@entity1 fog forced authorities to suspend the air search wednesday for seven @entity5 and four @entity7 aircrew , feared dead after their @entity9 helicopter crashed into waters off the @entity11			1
the helicopter was first reported missing at about 8:30 p.m. ( 9:30 p.m. et ) tuesday			1
hours later , searchers found debris around @entity16 near @entity17 , base spokesman @entity13 said			2
this debris washed up on both the north and south sides of @entity21 , which connects mainland northern @entity11 and a barrier island			2
the air search is expected to resume midday thursday , the spokesman said			1
a spokeswoman for the @entity27 said that boats will continue scouring the waters throughout the night wednesday , weather permitting			2
human remains have washed ashore in the area near @entity17			2
base spokeswoman @entity32 did n't specify what was found , noting the search - and - rescue mission remained underway			1
still , there was little hope for a miracle , with gen. @entity38 -- chairman of the @entity39 -- expressing his condolences			0
he said the crash was " a reminder to us that those who serve put themselves at risk , both in training and in combat			0
" " we will work with the services to ensure that ... their family members will be well cared for			1
" the @entity52 , @entity27 and civilian agencies participated in the intensive search focused on where they believe the aircraft went down , in waters east of the town of @entity60 and the @entity61 and near @entity17 testing range site @entity62			1
@entity32 said approximately 100 people were involved in canvassing the ground and the waters , looking for debris : " it 's a huge effort underway			0
" " we 're working closely with all the parties involved to locate our @entity5 and the @entity7 crew that were onboard , " added capt. @entity66 , a spokesman for the @entity67			1
" and , really , just our thoughts ( and ) prayers are with the @entity5 , the soldiers and the families of those involved in the mishap			1
" no one is saying what caused the accident , with @entity79 spokeswoman @entity78 indicating only that there 's no indication of anything suspicious			0
there was heavy fog in the area when the aircraft went missing , though the @entity79 spokeswoman said it 's too early to tell whether that had anything to do with the crash			1
" there is training in all conditions -- that 's part of the military mission , " @entity78 said			0
" they were out there doing what the military does			0
" according to @entity66 , the service members -- all men -- were involved in a seven - day training exercise of amphibious operations			1
it involved small boats and inserting and extracting @entity5 from the water via helicopter			1
@entity66 would not say in which phase of the training the @entity5 were on tuesday night			1
the @entity9 helicopter was n't alone when it went down			1
a second @entity9 -- assigned to 1 - 244th @entity109 based in @entity110 , @entity111 -- safely returned to the base , some 40 miles east of @entity113			0
the aircraft were both assigned to the @entity115 out of @entity110 and taking part in what the @entity118 military called a " routine training mission involving the @entity121 " out of @entity122			0
" whatever the trouble was with the one aircraft , it did not involve the second helicopter that was participating in the exercise , " @entity13 said			2
the @entity7 aircrew members belonged to the @entity129 unit out of @entity111 , part of a unit that gov. @entity132 said " have fought courageously overseas in defense of our nation and here at home			2
" by 11:15 a.m. , relatives of all four of those guardsmen had been notified , though their names wo n't be released publicly until the @entity27 recovers their bodies or calls off the search , said col. @entity142 , a @entity143 spokesman			2
" they have protected what matters most during times of crisis , " @entity132 said			0
" these soldiers represent the best of @entity111 , and we are praying for them and their families			0
" @entity66 said the @entity5 involved in the crash were all " highly - trained " members of that service 's special operations command			1
they were based out of @entity122 , an expansive @entity158 base that is home to about 170,000 active deputy , dependent , retired and civilian personnel			0
the pilots were instructor pilots , maj. gen. @entity162 told reporters			0
he said the whole crew had several thousand combined hours of operation flying the @entity9			2
in january , two @entity5 died when their helicopter went down at the @entity169 in @entity170 , @entity171			1
and last march , an @entity173 's pilot died after a crash about 70 miles east of @entity175 in western @entity176			0
this week 's crash involved a @entity9 - 60 @entity9 , a twin - engine helicopter introduced into @entity7 service in 1979 in place of the iconic @entity181			1
other branches have modified the @entity9 for their own uses , including the @entity185 's @entity184 ( the @entity184 ) , the @entity52 's @entity9 ( the @entity186 ) and the @entity27 's @entity186 ( the @entity187 )			0
the @entity7 's @entity9 helicopter , which has a maximum speed of 173 mph , has an airframe " designed to progressively crush on impact to protect the crew and passengers , " according to the service			1
as @entity66 , the @entity121 spokesman , pointed out , those who get on such aircraft or take part in other military exercises are n't always out of danger just because they 're off the battlefield			0
" we have a requirement to conduct realistic military training , " he said			0
" and unfortunately this mishap happened			0
" @entity2 's @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity210 contributed to this report .			0

heavy fog is *complicating* efforts ; the search is expected to resume thursday
