barring a revelation from his parents or girlfriend , we may never know what was going through the mind of @entity8 in the moments leading up to the crash of @entity11 9525			1
what we now know is that all indications point to @entity8 as the perpetrator of the crash , locking the pilot out of the cockpit and setting the aircraft on a fatal trajectory into a remote mountain range in the @entity21			1
every day , more details come to light , as the world struggles to make sense of why a 27 - year - old @entity27 man would apparently choose to deliberately crash a plane with 150 people on board , including himself -- and remain so calm while doing it			1
when investigators searched @entity8 's home in @entity35 , they found medical leave notes " slashed , " suggesting @entity8 was hiding an illness or illnesses from his employers			1
the dates for which @entity8 was excused from work included the day of the crash , though investigators have not yet revealed the reason he was excused , if any reason was written on the notes by his doctor			1
we do know , from a @entity27 aviation source , that @entity8 passed his annual pilot recertification examination last summer			1
an official with @entity50 , the parent company of the budget airline @entity51 , said that the exam only tests physical health , not psychological health			0
" he was 100 % fit to fly without restrictions , " @entity50 ceo @entity55 told reporters at press conference last week			0
" his flight performance was perfect			0
there was nothing to worry about			0
" @entity55 added that @entity8 had " interrupted " his training , which he began in 2008			1
that break lasted several months , he said , but that such an interruption is n't uncommon			0
@entity8 suffered from " generalized anxiety disorder , " with severe depression symptoms dating back to 2009 , according to @entity21 newspaper @entity67			1
while the main medical clinic in @entity35 denies it was treating @entity8 for depression , @entity27 investigators found antidepressant medications in @entity8 's apartment , according to published reports that @entity1 has not yet been able to independently confirm			1
@entity74 , a @entity27 newspaper , over the weekend cited an unidentified senior investigator , who said @entity8 suffered from " severe subjective burnout syndrome " and severe depression			1
" someone who has a significant depressive episode or depressive disorder will oftentimes get an antidepressant alone , and many times will have a good resolution of those symptoms , " @entity1 chief medical correspondent dr. @entity78 told @entity79 sunday on " @entity80			2
" " people who relapse or develop more of what is called a psychotic depression in addition may have symptoms of psychosis			1
maybe they could be having delusions or hallucinations , but the idea is having breaks with reality			0
" one of the medications @entity8 was prescribed is said to be @entity100 ( an antidepressant medication ) , according to @entity102			1
antidepressants can sometimes make people suicidal , especially those suffering from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder			2
other times , they can make patients manic or psychotic			0
the drug 's list of warnings and precautions include metabolic changes -- such as weight gain -- and the potential for cognitive and motor impairment			2
" has potential to impair judgment , thinking and motor skills ; use caution when operating machinery			0
" in 2010 , @entity8 received olanzpine injections ( an antipsychotic medication ) " to treat @entity126 , " according to @entity102			1
doctors advised @entity8 to be more active , practice a new sport and regain self - confidence			1
" this is a powerful medication , " said @entity78			0
" if this is true , it sort of reads into the severity of just how bad the psychosis was , at least at one point in his life			0
" there are other things besides psychosis for which the drug may be administered , but that 's the most common use			2
one of the side effects is blurred vision			0
citing two officials with knowledge of the investigation , the @entity145 saturday reported that @entity8 sought treatment for vision problems that might have put his career at risk			1
if he was prescribed this medication as an injectable five years ago , was now taking it as an oral antipsychotic and was n't taking it because of it was causing these detrimental side effects , " that could be very concerning , as well , " said @entity78			0
authorities have not ruled out that @entity8 's vision problem could have been psychosomatic			1
many people have been asking how likely it is that depression could result in this sort of horrific action			1
in a word : " unlikely , " says dr. @entity166 , a professor of psychiatry at the @entity168			0
" most people would just kill themselves , " he says			1
" it 's very , very rare for depression to cause people to kill other people			1
this leads me to believe there 's something else going on , like a personality character flaw			2
" forensic psychologist @entity179 agrees			0
" it has to be a very severe depression to the point that there 's a psychosis that 's a result of that depression , " he says			1
" that 's different than the schizophrenia part of psychosis			2
with this kind of depression , it 's so deep that you actually break with reality			1
" remember , @entity8 was in his late 20s -- and the odds of mental illness presenting at this age are much higher for someone in their 20s or 30s			1
" sometimes people lose touch with reality slowly			2
other times , they lose touch really quickly , " says @entity166			0
" bipolar psychotic states can develop in as little as a day or two			0
i 'm most curious what was going on in this guy 's life the week before this happened			2
did anyone see any changes with his behavior ? did he stop sleeping ? there 's a pretty good chance something would come up in speaking with the people in his life			1
" " if a story does n't make sense , it means you do n't have the real story , " says @entity166			0
" even people who are psychotic will tell you a crazy story			2
it 's crazy , but it makes sense			2
" more details are needed on @entity8 's story			1
perhaps the most chilling revelation so far is that @entity8 not only decided to do what he did , but that he ignored the pilot 's pleas to think about the lives on board and change his mind			1
" it tells you he 's at peace with what he 's doing , " says @entity166			2
" if you were uncertain or anxious , you might still open the cabin door ( when the pilot was banging on the door and yelling to be let in )			0
calm determination to do this tells you he really believed in what he was doing			0
" " if you look at school shooters , they go into a dissociative state , " says @entity179			0
" they 've been planning for quite some time			0
they go into this personality where they can calmly go into murder mode -- robotic and calm			0
even when they 're shooting or doing something rageful , they behave in a calm manner			0
( @entity265 ) knew when he got onto that plane that he was n't coming back			2
" on monday , @entity269 's most senior psychiatrist told @entity1 's @entity270 that when a pilot is " acutely depressed or suffering from ... any mental illness " that impairs his or her ability to fly , he or she can not fly an aircraft			0
" we do n't let pilots fly with depression , not because we 're worried that they 're going to murder everybody on board			0
that 's such an extraordinary possibility that -- that 's not depression -- but because they 're impaired in concentration , memory and attention , which is n't good for a pilot , " said sir @entity283 , president of the @entity284 and an adviser to the @entity269 army			1
@entity283 added that the @entity51 plane crash might open a discussion on " relaxing the laws of ( doctor - patient ) confidentiality in different countries , " though in the @entity269 , as well as in many other countries , a doctor is obliged to go to the authorities if he or she believes that people are genuinely being put at risk by one of their patients			2
