@entity1 in @entity3 , you can often tell what the @entity4 is thinking by watching tv			1
for years , the typical on - screen @entity3 family looked something like this : glowing parents doting over one precious child			1
the taglines drummed it home : " one hope			2
" lately , the perfect television family has changed			0
in a recent commercial , a boy begrudgingly shares a toy with his younger sister , then they all gather together with a large brood to watch the televised @entity25			0
the message appears to be : two is better than one			0
since the early 1980s , the party has enforced a draconian one - child policy on most @entity3 to curb population growth			1
when the propaganda did n't work , local officials have resorted to abortions , heavy fines , and forced sterilization			0
it 's perhaps the most hated policy in @entity3			1
now , under relaxed restrictions announced just over a year ago , couples like @entity40 and @entity41 , both professionals working in @entity1 , are eligible for a second child to join their baby girl -- 11 - month - old @entity45 , or @entity46			1
@entity47 was an only child but sometimes wished for a sibling while growing up			1
" once my cousin visited and we shared a bed for several nights , " says @entity47 , now an engineer			0
" i enjoyed that feeling			0
i wished i had a brother who could share a bed with me every night			0
" @entity47 and his young family live in @entity58 , on the eastern outskirts of @entity1 , where high rise apartments compete with mega malls			0
some call the area " @entity64 , " because its sprawl of young professionals is a bit like parts of the @entity69			0
they are ideal candidates , it would seem , to have a second child			1
@entity72 is in a race against the clock			0
@entity3 faces a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce			1
the government says the country could become home to the most elderly population on the planet in just 15 years , with more than 400 million over the age of 60			0
researchers say healthcare and social services will all be burdened by the greying population , and the world 's second largest economy will struggle to maintain its growth			2
" @entity3 has already begun to feel an unfolding crisis in terms of its population change , " says @entity90 , a professor at @entity91 and a leading demographic expert on @entity3			1
" history will look back to see the one - child policy as one of the most glaring policy mistakes that @entity3 has made in its modern history			1
" perhaps surprisingly , @entity90 says that the one - child policy was both ineffective and unnecessary , since @entity3 's fertility rates were already slowing by the 1980s			1
the @entity3 government still maintains that it was necessary to keep numbers down			1
but with around 150 million one - child families and a shrinking population , the @entity3 government is moving cautiously , rather than doing away with the policy altogether			1
in january 2014 , @entity3 said it would allow couples to have a second baby if the mother or father was an only child themselves			1
but , to the surprise of many , the new rules have n't yet sparked a baby boom			0
nationwide , nearly one million couples have applied to have a second child , state media reported in january			1
health officials had said that the policy would lead to as many as two million new births when the policy change was first announced			2
@entity40 and @entity47 both have good jobs , but rent in @entity58 is sky - high			2
and they want to send little @entity45 to a private bilingual @entity129 and @entity3 pre-school to help her in the ultra-competitive @entity3 education system			1
even if they were richer , they say they would n't want a second child			2
" money is only part of the problem , " says @entity40			0
" your energy and your time is also important			0
we both have to work			0
it is hard enough to raise her as a success			0
it will be miserable if we had to go through that again			0
" as for his cousin 's sleepovers , @entity47 wants to clarify			2
" it was great having him over , but i was also happy when he went home			2
" @entity2 's @entity151 contributed to this report			2

@entity3 's *controversial* one - child policy was recently relaxed
however , there 's been no big rush for a second child
many couples say the financial cost is too great
