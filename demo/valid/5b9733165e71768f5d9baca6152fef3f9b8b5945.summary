as planets go , @entity0 does n't get a lot of love			1
people spend more time on @entity6 searching for @entity8 singer @entity7 than planet @entity0 ... and @entity10 's been gone for nearly a quarter - century			1
not even @entity11 spends much time there , making it the least - explored inner planet in the solar system			0
but one question has long perplexed scientists : why 's the darned thing so dark ? compared with our own moon , which is about the same size , @entity0 reflects much less light			1
scientists at @entity23 , @entity24 and the @entity25 say they may have found the answer : it 's been " effectively painted black , " in the words of @entity29 , a postdoctoral researcher at @entity23			1
over the eons , the researchers argue in a paper published monday in the journal @entity36 , microscopic meteorites spawned from carbon - rich comets may have contributed enough dark - hued carbon to reduce the amount of reflected light			2
the pieces seem to fit together : there 's a lot more carbon dust thrown off from comets close to the sun , where @entity0 orbits -- about 50 times as much for @entity0 as for our moon , the researchers say			2
and tests using a big @entity11 gun made to simulate planetary impacts on a small scale seem to show the theory is plausible , the authors say			0
" we show that carbon acts like a stealth darkening agent , " said @entity56 , a professor emeritus of geological sciences at @entity24			0
" from the standpoint of spectral analysis , it 's like an invisible paint			0

@entity0 was " painted black " by *millions* of years of *micrometeorites* , researchers say
the research could solve the puzzle of why the planet appears so dark
