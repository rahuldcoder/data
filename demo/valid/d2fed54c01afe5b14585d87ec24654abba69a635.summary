@entity3 , @entity4 at least six people have died and more than 60 were injured after the roof of a partially built cement factory collapsed thursday in southwestern @entity4 , police and fire officials told @entity5			1
many of those injured were in critical condition , said @entity11 , the top government physician of @entity13 district			1
@entity14 , the fire and civil defense official coordinating the search and rescue effort , said early thursday evening that two people had been pulled alive from the rubble and as many as 30 others are believed to be still trapped			2
deputy inspector general of police of @entity24 range @entity22 said the number of those still trapped was unclear " as we 're not sure how many people were working inside			0
" the collapse took place around 1 p.m. ( 3 a.m. et ) in @entity31 , a port city in the @entity34 nation 's @entity32			0
the factory is owned by @entity36 , a welfare organization for former @entity4 troops and their beneficiaries , according to @entity14 and other local officials			1
video from @entity41 showed medical workers tending to the injured as they were wheeled into a local medical facility caked in dust			2
deadly incidents at factories and other buildings , sadly , are nothing new in @entity4			1
the worst happened on april 24 , 2013 , when a nine - story building that housed five garment factories collapsed			2
rescuers managed to save the lives of more than 2,400 people , but more than 1,100 died in the horrific accident			0
and a november 2012 apparel factory fire on @entity3 's outskirts killed at least 117 people , some of whom jumped from the building to escape the flames			2
most of the dead were women , almost half of them burned so badly that dna tests were needed to identify them			0
that blaze led to the convictions of 13 people for gross negligence of safety measures and spurred widespread criticism about the state of workers ' rights in @entity4			1
the government responded by revamping laws so that workers no longer need approval from employers to form trade unions , and every factory that sells within the country also has to pledge 5 % of their profits toward a workers ' welfare fund			1
the government also boosted minimum wages from $ 38 to around $ 68 per month			0
yet this has n't stopped more deadly incidents , including the january deaths of at least 13 people when a fire broke out inside a @entity3 factory			1
