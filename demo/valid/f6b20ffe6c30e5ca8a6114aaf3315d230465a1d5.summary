@entity1 , it seems , is everywhere			1
the @entity4 film of that name continues to draw audiences and plaudits , while this month marks the 50th anniversary of three pivotal civil rights marches from the @entity11 city -- the first two stopped by brute force , the third a triumphant procession to the state capital of @entity15 led by @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and other activists			1
now , the events that seared those marches into the @entity23 consciousness are the subject of a photography show at the @entity26 in @entity27			1
" @entity1 march 1965 " brings together -- for the first time , anywhere -- pictures by three essential witnesses of the civil rights era : @entity33 , @entity34 and the man @entity35 calls " the single greatest civil rights photographer " -- @entity37			1
the pictures in the gallery above include @entity37 's work in @entity1 and from other parts of the @entity42 , including some of the riveting , award - winning photos he made in @entity45 , @entity11 , in 1963			1
( two weeks after his @entity45 pictures appeared in a landmark issue of @entity48 , a letter to the editor succinctly captured the elemental power of @entity37 's work			2
the @entity45 pictures , wrote a reader from @entity55 , were " superb and bone - chilling			0
" ) " the quality , the depth , the sense of reality that he brings to the work is unparalleled , " @entity35 said of @entity37 's civil rights shots			1
@entity35 's own bona fides on the topic , meanwhile , are well - established : he 's mounted photography shows on the civil rights movement in 30 different public venues since the mid- 1990s			1
" it 's important to remember that @entity37 was a white @entity69 , " @entity35 said			2
" he was the photographer at the @entity70 -- hardly a bastion of integration -- who became very sympathetic to the movement			0
i knew @entity37 pretty well , and he had many sides to him -- sides he was able to reconcile and that allowed him to shoot with a deep understanding of so many different points of view			2
he was not parachuting into these marches and protests in the @entity42			0
he had roots there and was fully engaged			0
" of course , there are lots of really good pictures of the era by , say , @entity89 , @entity90 and others , but they 're @entity92 -- and i think that shows			0
there 's a sense in many of the photos made in the @entity42 by @entity99 photographers that what they were capturing was somehow exotic			0
for @entity37 , this was home			2
" at his very best , @entity37 invested his pictures with an unsettling intimacy			0
whether he was chronicling the overt , graphic suppression of human rights or framing a profoundly human moment -- as in his unforgettable shot of bloodied poet @entity109 in @entity1 -- @entity37 's photographs often feel as if he was shooting with @entity112 's famous dictum ringing in his ears : " if your photographs are n't good enough , you 're not close enough			1
" @entity37 was always , always close enough			0
@entity117 , who was a staff photographer at life and later the founding picture editor for @entity120 , the monthly , in the late ' 70s and ' 80s , calls @entity1 " a not particularly dramatic event , photographically			2
" he does , however , have high praise for @entity37 's @entity45 work , specifically , and his legacy in general			2
" there 's no question that @entity136 made some phenomenal pictures , " said @entity117 -- who , incidentally , took one of the most memorable photos of the civil rights era : a life cover of @entity130 ' weeping widow and son at the slain activist 's funeral in june 1963			1
" and he did a terrific job , for example , on a cover story on ( @entity11 gov. ) @entity142 in the first few months of people			0
" social media follow @ @entity145 on @entity146 to join the conversation about photography			0
whatever else @entity37 might have shot , and however routinely excellent his output over the course of his long career , there 's little doubt he 'll always be remembered and honored for his work during those fraught years of the early and mid- 1960s			2
" what 's especially significant to me about @entity37 ' civil rights work , " @entity35 said , " is his clear affinity with nonviolence at the same time that he 's depicting the irrationality and brutality of the segregationists			1
" in his famous picture of a police dog attacking a black man in @entity45 in ' 63 , for example , the figure in the photo is a perfect symbol of nonviolence			0
you know , the man is standing there , taking it , not fighting back , amid this incredible rush of hatred and violence and as another dog is charging right at @entity37 's -- at the viewer 's -- face			0
it 's a terribly complex image , swirling with information , but in the middle of it is this unmistakable emblem of the movement -- an emblem of the power and bravery of civil disobedience			0
" @entity37 was an @entity23 photographer known for his images documenting the civil rights movement in the 1960s			1
some of his photos are included in " selma march 1965 , " a photography show taking place at @entity27 's @entity26 from march 5 to april 18 .			1

the @entity26 will be showing powerful photos from the 1965 @entity1 marches
included are images from the late @entity37 , whose civil rights work is *legendary*
