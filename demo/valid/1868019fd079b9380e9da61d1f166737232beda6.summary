the news that the @entity3 military will charge @entity5 sgt. @entity4 with desertion for abandoning his post in @entity8 revives a deeply disturbing and morally wrenching incident in @entity3 's troubled war in @entity8			1
from the moment last year that the world learned about the prisoner - swap deal that secured his freedom , the questions that surrounded @entity18 's disappearance gained significance			1
after all , the @entity3 had agreed to a very high price for his release			2
based on the evidence that has come to public light , desertion seems the right charge against @entity4 , whose comrades say he walked away , abandoning his commitments as a soldier in a war and creating new and greater dangers for them			1
but even before the charges were filed , there were other question whose answers are emerging			0
was the @entity3 right to negotiate a high - price trade ? did " leave no man behind " trump " no negotiating with terrorists " ? and if it did , did the importance of saving one man outweigh the dictate not to pay ransom even if that man was a traitor or a deserter ? new information about his disappearance and life of the people freed in exchange for @entity4 make the case all the more troubling			1
@entity4 , you will recall , spent five years as a prisoner of the @entity61 , a group allied with the @entity64 organization , @entity3 's principal enemy in @entity8			1
@entity64 fighters had captured him in june 2009 , just after @entity67 , apparently disenchanted with the military , left his post in southeastern @entity8			0
the @entity64 handed the @entity3 soldier to the @entity61 , who shuttled him between locations as they and their partners negotiated for his release , seeking to maximize the profit from their valuable captive			1
in may 2014 they struck a deal			0
five @entity64 commanders were flown out of the @entity3 prison at @entity80 , freed in exchange for the @entity3 soldier whose disappearance many had already labeled a desertion			1
a strikingly pale @entity4 , blinking painfully against the bright sun as he was handed over to @entity3 officials			1
the scene contrasted sharply with a video of the @entity64 chiefs ' receiving a heroes ' welcome in @entity92 , where they prepared for a new life after their @entity3 captivity			2
national security adviser @entity95 said @entity4 had served with " honor and distinction			2
" if that had been the case , the trade would have proved much less controversial			0
but from the moment @entity4 went missing there had been questions			1
in the letters he wrote home before vanishing , @entity4 showed a steady erosion of his faith in the military and belief in the mission			2
" the future is too good to waste on lies , " he told his parents			0
" and life is way too short to care for the damnation of others			0
" men who had served with @entity4 said he had simply walked off the base carrying little more than a compass			2
not only would such a move constitute near - suicidal foolishness , it also put his comrades in great danger , particularly as they set out on a desperate quest to find him			0
what has been the cost of @entity4 's odyssey ? some said the search for him cost the lives of six @entity3 soldiers			1
the specific circumstances are complicated , but it is clear that the six died in @entity135 in the months after @entity4 vanished , during a period in which every mission , even if not directly aimed at finding @entity4 , included some element of a search			2
as one former team leader told @entity0 , " when those soldiers were killed , they would not have been where they were if @entity4 had not left			2
" one of them , 2nd lt @entity145 , received a posthumous @entity146 for saving the lives of five soldiers during a mission that had shifted from searching for a @entity64 target to looking for @entity4			1
@entity145 left behind a pregnant wife and a 2 - year - old son			0
then there is the cost of signaling to the @entity64 , of telling all of @entity3 's enemies , that if they capture a @entity3 service member they could trade him for a ransom			1
this could endanger other @entity3			2
and there is another potential cost : the men who were freed in exchange for @entity4 could go on to fight again			1
the more you learn about the details of their post-guantanamo lives , the more distressing the transaction looks			0
under the terms of the deal , @entity92 agreed to keep the former prisoners from leaving the country for one year			0
in the meantime , they are said to be living a life of fantastic comfort and luxury , courtesy of their gracious @entity92 hosts			0
according to reports , they have each been allowed to bring five more families to keep them company			0
the 35 @entity64 households are living in the lap of @entity92 luxury , but the fighters are getting restless			0
at least two of the former @entity80 detainees reportedly want to go back to the battlefield , perhaps adding to the eventual tally of the @entity4 transaction			2
now @entity4 will face his punishment ; he could be sentenced to life in prison for what the military says was desertion and misbehavior , and what his comrades said was a shameful betrayal -- one that cost lives			1
the question remains , should the @entity3 have traded for this man ? my sense is that the @entity3 has a duty to the soldiers it sends to war			0
all soldiers should know that their country will do what it takes to bring them back			0
@entity3 could not leave @entity4 to die in a mountain cave , especially if it did not know with certainty the circumstances of his disappearance -- but even if it did			1
whether the @entity221 administration negotiated as effectively as it could have is another matter			0
on that count , i am skeptical			0
the trade -- @entity4 for several hardened prisoners -- was a heart - splitting dilemma , but it was the right call .			1

@entity229 : desertion charges against @entity4 revive questions : was swap deal for him correct ? what has his odyssey cost ?
she says swap may have sent dangerous *message* to @entity3 's enemies , cost @entity3 lives . still , retrieving @entity3 soldier was right call
