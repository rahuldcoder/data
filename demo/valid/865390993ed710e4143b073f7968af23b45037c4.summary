as relatives and friends mourn the loss of their loved ones aboard @entity5 , the world community is stunned by the sequence of events that led to co-pilot @entity9 purposely crashing the plane into the @entity11 , killing all 150 people on board			1
i happen to have several personal connections to this tragedy : a recent graduate of @entity18 -- where i teach -- and her mother were on the ill - fated flight , i lived in @entity21 for 18 years and i am a psychologist who has researched the psychology of terrorism and developed psychiatric tests that are used to determine pilot flight fitness			1
while the engineering of the @entity30 aircraft is fascinating and the world of air traffic control absorbing , what is even more complex and challenging to understand is the human mind of the co-pilot investigators say is responsible for the crash -- the machine that flies the machine			1
when complex engineering systems interact with human factors , it is most often the human that causes the anomaly			2
humans are far less reliable than machines			2
the average aviator has superior intellectual and cognitive abilities , and is psychologically stable and reliable			2
while it is not surprising that when it comes to aviation accidents , the first line of inquiry is into what went wrong with the plane			0
however , very often , as apparently is the case here , something went wrong with the human flying the plane			0
pilots are typically tested for emotional stability and screened for the presence of mental illness when they are selected			2
the @entity63 has strict testing programs related to fitness for duty protocols for their pilots during the length of their careers			1
but we have learned that the @entity21 company @entity72 and its budget airline affiliate @entity5 do not use psychological testing once the pilots have made it through the selection process			1
psychological assessment and screening is not held in as high esteem in @entity21 as it is in the @entity80			1
a fitness - for - duty evaluation asks this important question : can the pilot safely and effectively perform his job from a mental health and cognitive standpoint ? the deliberate destruction of @entity5 by a single person , most likely related to some grievance or other unknown intrinsic motivation that he took to the grave , can also be considered an act of terrorism			1
the action constitutes the unlawful use of violence against the passengers on the flight to further some yet unknown objective			0
research on the perpetrators of terrorism has revealed that a single person is capable of executing odd , unexplainable violent actions			0
their behaviors may be related to a political or social framework , or it may be associated with something deeply personal			0
examples include @entity112 , the failed shoe bomber ; @entity113 , the @entity115 bomber ; or @entity116 , the @entity116			0
in 2009 , maj. @entity117 , a @entity118 officer and psychiatrist , went on a shooting spree at @entity121 , @entity122 , killing 13 and wounding 32			0
and in 2012 , staff sgt. @entity123 , a 38 - year - old father of two , opened fire and killed 16 innocent @entity126 civilians			0
when examining @entity127 from the " cockpit of the human mind , " one must ask this question : how can we ever predict or prevent tragedies like these when we can never truly know what lurks in the mind of another human being ? as a psychologist , i would , of course , advocate for more rigorous psychological screening and regular testing for pilots , as well as instituting additional security measures to prevent future incidents like this			1
just as aircraft are inspected and maintained , it is important to regularly evaluate one of the more fragile components of modern aviation -- the pilots operating the plane			2
but , just as the overwhelming majority of automobile accidents are caused by driver error , with a human mind at the helm of an aircraft , there will always be an element of unpredictability present			0
and , unless we had a " flight recorder " for the human brain , we will never really know what took place inside the mind of co-pilot @entity9			0
one thing is for sure : the tragic events of @entity5 will surely renew conversation about what happened to flight mh370 -- the biggest aviation mystery since @entity172 vanished in 1937 -- and the role that human factors may have played in its disappearance .			1

@entity177 : it *'s* hard to predict or prevent tragedies like the @entity5 crash
he says @entity21 airlines should consider more rigorous psychological screening and testing for pilots
