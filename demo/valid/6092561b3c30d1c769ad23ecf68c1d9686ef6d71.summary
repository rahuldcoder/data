the photographs released by @entity1 in its stronghold of @entity3 are dated march 2015			1
the first ones show a large crowd , mostly men , but also among them a handful of women and children , all looking up			2
three men on top of a building , faces covered in black balaclavas , stand on either side of their victim , while a fourth seems to be taking a photo or video			2
their victim is thrown off the building			2
in the last photograph , he is seen face down , surrounded by a small crowd of men , most carrying weapons , some with rocks in their hands			2
the caption reads " stoned to death			2
" the victim brutally killed because he was accused of being gay			1
there are at least half a dozen documented cases of men being similarly killed by @entity1			1
what 's even more sickening for @entity36 , a gay @entity37 man , is the onlookers ' reaction			1
" it 's too much to watch , and people are just standing there in these images and watching , and they are not doing anything , and their facial expressions are really scary because they are not even scared of what is going on , " says @entity36 , who 's also an lgbt rights activist			1
" they might be a little bit excited or maybe happy to get rid of homosexuals in the city			2
" though in @entity52 , fear of persecution continues to haunt @entity36 , who asked us to conceal his identity as he waits and hopes for asylum in @entity56 and continues to campaign for rights for people who are @entity40 -- lesbian , gay , bisexual and trans. as a teenager , over a decade ago , @entity36 suffered because of his sexuality			1
" the worst bullying was at school , " he remembers			2
" i was approached in the street a number of times , verbally abused and sometimes physically abused			0
" there was no one to protect him			2
his family rejected his sexual orientation , his country criminalized it			0
@entity72 of the @entity37 @entity73 of 1949 states : " any unnatural sexual intercourse shall be punished with a term of imprisonment of up to three years			1
" @entity36 left @entity37 in 2012 , before @entity1 took over huge swaths of the country , after seeing a video of two men being beheaded			1
according to the voice on the clip , they are accused of being spies			0
then toward the end , the voice speaks about " shaking the throne of @entity87			0
" " whenever we hear this in video or audio , we know that this is exactly meant for gay people , " he says			1
" it was the moment of clarity , the moment of understanding ; this place is not safe anymore			0
" the pictures released by @entity1 and other videos refer to gay men as the tribe of @entity104 , who , according to readings of the @entity106 and the hadith , or prophetic traditions , sinned by refusing @entity110 's call to cease their homosexual activity and led to the destruction of @entity114			1
one hadith states , " when a man mounts another man , the throne of @entity87 shakes			0
" since the revolution turned war in @entity37 , the situation for the nation 's @entity40 community has become even more dire			1
" @entity40 people in @entity37 need help , and they need to be supported			1
we tried to reach out to some groups , international entities , and they said that @entity40 people in @entity37 are not our priority , and that would mean that our lives are not worthy for them to rescue , " @entity36 says			1
this week , the @entity133 , a nongovernmental organization based in @entity134 , started " @entity139 , " an awareness - raising campaign calling for action to protect @entity40 @entity37 and @entity137 from @entity1 ' merciless brutality			1
on its website , the group states , " what is clear is the @entity145 's intent -- to spread terror among an already persecuted population in the region and to warn against any kind of ' moral ' transgression			0
" the commission is calling on governments and the @entity153 high commissioner for refugees to expedite resettlement and refugee applications for @entity156			2
@entity157 and his partner are among those waiting			0
dressed in matching outfits , they already consider themselves married , laughing about how they first met online			0
they too , like @entity36 , do n't want their identities revealed			1
when @entity157 's family found out about his relationship , he says , his brother tried to beat him up			0
he started to receive threatening phone calls from family and strangers			0
this past summer , while the couple was walking in the streets in @entity175 , a car tried to run them over			0
" i was able to pull myself away , but my husband could n't , " @entity157 recalls			0
" the car hit his leg and he fell to the ground			0
" there is no doubt that it was a deliberate attempt to kill them			0
two hours after the attack , @entity157 's phone rang			0
" there was a man who said this time you could have made it , you could have survived , but the next time you will not			0
" the couple fled to @entity192 a few months ago , but they ca n't shake the fear that their relationship could cost them their lives			1
they share housing with other @entity37 refugees , where they have to continue to pretend that they are straight			1
when the @entity1 photographs emerged , one of their housemates made a sickening comment			1
" he made an absurd joke about how he was so amused , had too much fun watching homosexuals			0
he says now gay men can fly			2
" they say they will never return to @entity37			1
" it 's too damaging for my psychological state , because i have been abused too much from my family , friends , school			0
it 's not safe for me psychologically or physically , " he says			0
opinion : @entity1 's warped take on morality			1

" @entity40 people in @entity37 need help , and they need to be supported , " says @entity36 , a @entity37 gay rights activist now living in @entity192
" we tried to reach out to some groups , international entities , and they said that @entity40 people in @entity37 are not our priority , " he says
the @entity133 is calling for action to protect @entity40 @entity37 and @entity137 from @entity1
