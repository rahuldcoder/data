it 's playing out like a scene from " @entity3 " -- in the boardroom of one of @entity7 's most famous clubs			2
director @entity9 's horror cult classic revolved around a swarm of slow - moving cannibalistic corpses snacking on the inhabitants of a shopping mall and @entity15 general manager and team legend @entity16 talks in similarly apocalyptic tones as he details the financial crisis engulfing the @entity22 club			1
" it seems like we are zombies , working without knowing where we are heading , " @entity16 told @entity1 's @entity23			2
rooted at the bottom of @entity7 's top flight , @entity15 has debts of approximately $ 100 million and faces a looming financial collapse -- barring a miracle ownership rescue			1
the club has been docked points twice this season for failing to pay its players and faces a bankruptcy hearing on march 19			1
" every day they take away a part of our work and piece of our hearts			0
bits of the club are foreclosed every day and we come here to work just because we love our work and our team , but we can not do our job , " added @entity16			2
" we 're living in a nightmare , whichever way you look at it			0
because this is not just about the money , even though we ca n't ignore it , there is a lot more that they are taking away			0
@entity59 , the smile ; they took away our respect and it hurts			0
" last season @entity15 finished sixth in @entity22 , only to be barred from taking part in @entity65 football 's second tier competition -- the @entity66 -- over an income tax bill			1
between 1992 and 2002 @entity15 won two @entity68 , the 1992 @entity69 and three @entity71 cups in a successful spell between 1992 and 2002			1
in 1997 , led by current @entity74 coach @entity73 and with the caliber of players like @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 , @entity15 finished runners - up in @entity22 " look at the team we had , " said @entity81 , president of the @entity15 supporters club , referring to those halycon days , as he rattled off other players including @entity16 , @entity84 and longtime @entity7 captain and goalkeeper @entity85 , who now plays for @entity87			1
" all were players who meant something to football			2
" fast forward to more austere times and @entity15 's current players have n't been paid since august			1
they 're so fed up they 've threatened to go on strike -- that is if the games are allowed proceed in the first place , with two of @entity15 's recent fixtures having been called off given the club 's problems			1
@entity15 was once owned by the world 's leading dairy company , @entity105 , which collapsed under financial fraud in 2003			1
the club has already changed hands twice this season after a @entity113 - @entity112 conglomerate sold the club to @entity115			1
a despairing @entity16 depicted a club that is being seemingly taken apart seat by seat , screw by screw			2
" one day , we wo n't have the laundry anymore , " said @entity16			0
" the next day , computers ( will be ) taken away , then we do n't have emails anymore			0
" and then the physical objects related to sport , like benches , like the team bus ... everyday it 's like being stabbed			0
" for his part , @entity115 has reportedly said he will not sell the club , which will likely mean another spell in administration for @entity15 , the second time in the past 10 years			1
their next scheduled match is a home game on march 22 against @entity137 , but @entity16 is more concerned about what the future holds in store for @entity15 rather than the next 90 minutes			1
" i hope to have a new owner to sort out our debts and save the brand , starting again from @entity145 and to start again with new management that loves what they are managing , " said @entity16			0
" slowly , we can rebuild			0
it will take time and patience , with the right people in the right places			0
only in this way can @entity15 be reborn like a @entity155			2
" objectively , it 's unlikely this will happen			0
this is just the hope of a lover , trying to find his lost love			0
but he needs the help of others , we ca n't make it by ourselves			0
