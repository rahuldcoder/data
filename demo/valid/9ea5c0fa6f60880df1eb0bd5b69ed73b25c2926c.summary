i like to think i 'm a pretty optimistic person			2
even at dark moments for this country -- after 9/11 or @entity4 , for example -- my tendency is always to scout out the sliver of hope for future progress			0
but i 've got to be honest with you , sometimes that optimism only goes so far			0
the morning after the 2004 election , when voters in 11 states passed constitutional bans on marriage equality , i never thought i 'd see committed and loving gay and lesbian couples getting married in my lifetime -- in @entity20 of all places			1
what 's more , i certainly never thought that , 50 years after a march for voting rights went from @entity25 to @entity26 , that the first couple to get married there would be a courageous @entity30 - @entity30 couple , @entity29 and @entity31 , who camped out overnight on the sidewalk outside the courthouse just to be the first in line			1
they slept on that chilly pavement despite the ravings of chief justice @entity39 of the @entity40 , who has issued baseless edict after baseless edict urging the state 's probate judges to ignore a federal court ruling ( which supersedes a state ruling ) and to refuse to treat @entity48 people equally under the law			1
even today , more than half the counties in the state are refusing to issue licenses to gay couples			2
in an interview with @entity1 's @entity56 on thursday , chief justice @entity39 even compared refusing marriage licenses to gay couples to refusing to enforce the 1857 @entity60 decision ( which upheld the legal status of slaves as property )			1
i 'm not a trained lawyer , but the logic seems to be that the refusal to treat people like slaves under the law is similar to the refusal to grant gay and lesbians their equal rights to marry under the law			2
that logic is not only faulty ( restricting rights is not similar to expanding them ) but offensive			0
the 13 states that still ban same - sex marriage many are highlighting the echoes of the past in @entity20 right now ; of gov. @entity82 actually blocking two @entity30 students from entering the auditorium of the @entity85 as they tried to desegregate the school ; of civil rights battles come and gone			1
me ? i 'm focused on the future			0
in just a few months , the @entity89 @entity40 could end this chapter of our history once and for all			1
even with @entity20 entering the marriage equality column , there are still 13 states that deny these couples their equal rights			1
that 's why this spring , the @entity40 will hear a case that will determine whether the @entity89 @entity101 can tolerate that kind of discrimination			1
federal judge : @entity20 judges must issue gay marriage licenses we 've all got to raise our voices in support of couples like @entity29 and @entity111			1
but , after @entity117 , @entity113 , and @entity114 , the case gutting the @entity116 in 2013 , sometimes it seems like the voices of the @entity30 people do n't get heard by those nine justices			0
that 's why i 'm so inspired and excited about a new idea from the @entity124 and @entity125 , the lawyer who represented @entity126 in the case that famously struck down the @entity127			0
together , they 've launched the @entity130 's brief			0
the idea behind the @entity129 is an original twist on the legal concept of the " amicus curiae " ( @entity134 for " friend of the court			0
" ) the legal system allows those who are not party to a case , but who have interests in the case , or information relevant to it , to submit their opinions , information , or testimony on the matter at hand			0
it 's a way of guaranteeing that the court is not missing any relevant facts or opinions just because those who hold them are not parties to the litigation			0
the @entity129 marks the first time that the @entity30 people -- the 58 % of @entity89 who support marriage equality , anyway -- can make their voices heard in an official brief to those justices			1
the @entity130 's brief will serve as a poignant reminder to the @entity40 that gay marriage is an issue that impacts the lives of both gay and straight , of those who are the family , friends , and loved ones of gay people , and of those who simply value a society where the rights of all people are treated with equal dignity			1
by going to @entity178 , you can sign your name , review the brief -- and it 'll be bundled up with thousands of others and sent to those nine justices for review			0
the number of people who sign the @entity130 's brief will make that point in a way that no legal argument could			2
in past civil rights struggles , such as the one that took place half a century ago in @entity25 , @entity20 , well - intentioned people far from the fray had no easy way to express their support			1
now modern technology is being harnessed in a creative way to allow people to do just that in the struggle for marriage equality			2
i think that 's pretty forward - thinking for a court that still does n't allow cameras or online case filings			2
in fact , i think it 's long overdue			0
i 've signed my name to the @entity130 's brief , and i hope @entity89 from all backgrounds will do the same or just try to learn more about marriage equality			1
no one said progress is easy , but true social change is worth fighting for			0
today , i 'm optimistic that if change can come to @entity20 , there is no reason why it ca n't come to all 50 states			1
fair - minded folks should n't be silent at this moment			2
it 's time to put your name on the right side of history			0
lend your voice to a chorus too large to be ignored .			0
