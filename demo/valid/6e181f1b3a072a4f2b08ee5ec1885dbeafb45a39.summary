@entity0 is going back to war			1
the massively popular superhero entertainment factory has the third " @entity9 " movie on the way , " @entity8 , " which will include @entity6 and quite possibly , the new @entity7			1
it 's based on a story arc from almost a decade ago , which tackled issues of freedom versus security , with the two heroes going toe to toe against one another			2
this summer , @entity0 plans to revisit that storyline as part of the much larger return of " @entity22 , " its biggest crossover event of the 1980s			1
the effects of this will be huge to the comics , ending 33 of the company 's titles			1
@entity1 spoke to writer @entity29 , who has gained acclaim for his work on " @entity32 , " " @entity33 , " the death of @entity35 , " " @entity36 " and more			0
he gave us the scoop on the return of " @entity8 , " one year before it hits the big screen			1
@entity1 : what can fans expect from your " @entity8 " storyline ? @entity45 : " @entity22 " is an opportunity to revisit some of the great @entity0 stories of the past			1
one of those is " @entity8 , " and i got the call to work on that			1
" @entity8 " happened in 2006 and 2007 , and in that story @entity9 and @entity6 went after each other based on an ideological difference on superheroes in the world			1
what i 'm doing is taking that story in a different direction			2
@entity1 : will this be a way for those who are interested in the upcoming movie to dive into that story ? @entity45 : absolutely			2
if you look at the ideas that that story had , @entity6 thought superheroes should have to register with the government , and become something of a police force			0
@entity9 thought that that was restricting the central freedoms of this country			0
it was a debate of security versus freedom			0
we 're taking that basic idea and expanding it to a larger canvas			0
the @entity81 is all in the past at this point			0
it 's more of a world drastically changed based on a superhero war , and it 's a huge story and it 's fun to be able to involve every @entity0 character there is			1
@entity1 : is this one of the biggest stories you 've worked on ? @entity45 : i 've been on big books but this one feels huge			0
it affects every character in one way or another , and it deals with some central issues to the modern world			0
that 's not always something you get to do in a @entity0 story			1
@entity1 : so this will have many twists and turns away from the original story ? @entity45 : the idea is to take some of the events in the original storyline and spin them off into entirely new stories			2
without spoiling , this deals with a world that has been ravaged for quite some time when we pick up the story			0
i felt the original " @entity8 " explored those questions very well			2
if i was going to play in this sandbox , i wanted to ask my own questions .			0

this summer , the popular 1980s " @entity125 " comic book storyline will return
story will affect every @entity0 comic , ending 33 titles
2000s " @entity8 " story will also be revisiting , *pitting* characters against each other
