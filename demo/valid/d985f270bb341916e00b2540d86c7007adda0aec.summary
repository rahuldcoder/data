in some ways , @entity1 's president pilots our ship of state as a captain pilots a jumbo jet , and this analogy suggests one possible way to avoid a repeat of the @entity13 massacre : give the plane 's flight crew certain powers akin to those given to @entity1 's @entity17 in the rare and terrifying situation when the president and vice president are at swords ' point			1
both presidents and plane captains must be shielded from lunatics and terrorists			2
this is why airlines across the world hardened cockpit doors after 9/11 and why @entity1 of all stripes are outraged by stories that the @entity34 on several occasions has failed to maintain proper security at the @entity37			1
both presidents and plane captains are human , and subject to all the frailties of humans , from temporary disabilities created by bathroom breaks ( for pilots ) and scheduled surgeries ( for presidents ) to sudden death			2
transitions in both the @entity49 and the cockpit should be made as smooth as possible			2
hence the need for a vice president at the ready , able to take over at a moment 's notice			1
the obvious aviation analogy here is the second pilot in the cockpit			0
in case of sudden death , the vice president or co-pilot simply takes over immediately			1
in case of a temporary disability -- say , a scheduled surgery under general anesthesia -- the president can hand over control to the vice president and then take back control when the disability ends			1
it is exactly what happened when president @entity73 underwent planned colonoscopies in 2002 and 2007			1
on both occasions , @entity73 handed the tiller to his trusted co-pilot , @entity77 , and then resumed control when ready , under rules clearly laid out by the @entity81 's @entity80 -- an amendment drafted and ratified after the shocking assassination of president @entity83			1
but what happens if a president is unable to predict his own future disability , or unable to recognize a genuine disability when it arises ? the 25th @entity80 allows the vice president to take over control in this situation , but to do so , the vice president needs the support of a majority of @entity17 officers -- officials previously appointed by the president himself and thus unlikely to support any inappropriate vice presidential power grab			1
on a jumbo jet , a co-pilot may likewise take over in certain situations			0
but current airplane architecture fails to use the crew in the optimal way			0
when one officer has barricaded himself in the cockpit and the other officer is banging on the door demanding entry , current airplane design enables the man in the cockpit unilaterally to block the demand for entrance with the flick of a switch			0
think of this as an absolute veto			0
( some airlines get around the problem with a rule that a flight attendant must replace a pilot so that there will always be at least two people in the cockpit			1
) but suppose instead that airlines were to borrow sensibly a page from @entity1 's @entity81			1
the man in the cockpit could temporarily block entrance , but this veto could be overridden if -- and only if -- the door - banging officer is backed by a majority of the flight attendants			0
the need for some sort of secure cockpit lock is obvious			0
perhaps the officer banging on the door has gone mad , or is being held hostage at knifepoint , or is a terrorist mole			0
but the need for an override is also obvious			1
perhaps the man in the cockpit is the bad guy			0
and just as @entity1 's @entity17 officers are well - positioned to decide any dispute between a president and vice president wrestling over the key to the @entity49 , so too with an airplane 's crew : the cockpit lock button could be electronically overridden whenever a majority of flight attendants punched in their own individual passcodes in sequence on a keypad somewhere outside the cockpit door			2
this proposed technological fix will not prevent all future tragedies			0
no human system is foolproof			2
but giving the crew a collective key brings more human minds into the equation -- as does the @entity80 's rule empowering the @entity17 to resolve certain terrifying disputes at the highest level of executive power			0
on planes , as in a constitutional democracy , there is often safety in numbers .			0

@entity175 : when a leader is irrational or *incapacitated* , we need an override *mechanism*
@entity175 : airlines could learn from system used in @entity81 to replace disabled president
