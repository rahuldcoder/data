@entity3 , @entity1 it is a strangely formal , yet troubling scene			2
a room in a far flung corner of @entity1 where a serious lecture is happening , to an audience that seems part ideological , part curious ; some are just impoverished , hoping for a quick job			2
at the front of this room stands an @entity1 freshly back from fighting in @entity15 , and intent on recruiting other @entity1 to fight alongside him for @entity18			1
" @entity20 , i am here to tell you " , the recruiter begins , " about the mujahideen in @entity15			0
" all faces are hidden in the footage , yet the motivations are clear			0
this seems to be part of @entity18 's first moves into @entity1 , a bid to bolster their ranks for the fight in @entity34 and @entity15 by vacuuming up disgruntled former @entity36 fighters -- or even just students looking for a cause			1
but it 's a troubling move nonetheless			0
there 's no shortage of battle - hardened militants here			1
and as @entity43 leaves , the @entity36 looks strong if a little fractured -- and the possibility of peace talks ahead with the @entity1 government could alienate some of the group 's more radical elements			1
the man is one of five recruiters , he says -- some foreign , others @entity1 like him , spread out across the country			2
his message is broadly ideological			0
" @entity57 is now obligatory not only in @entity1 , but also in many other places in the world , " the recruiter tells the room			2
" the @entity60 and @entity61 have not only attacked @entity1 , but they have also attacked @entity62 in @entity15 , @entity34 and @entity63			2
so @entity57 is obligatory on us in these places			0
" his reception is mixed , but to one audience member the ideological appeal is clear			0
" my aim is to fight infidels , " the man says			0
" in @entity15 , or if they ask me to in @entity1 , i will			2
" another man says he would prefer to stay home and go to university , but he is attracted by the recruiter 's offer of money			0
" i definitely need the money , " he says , " but will stay here and hope peace comes			0
" concerns are growing about how @entity18 may expand into @entity1			1
when asked why @entity18 might be on the rise here , @entity1 president @entity83 told @entity2 's @entity86 : " the reason it 's happening is because ( the ) collapse of @entity90 , @entity15 , @entity34 has created an environment where instead of one weak link in the interrelated system of states , now there are wider spaces			1
" @entity83 added : " they have -- it 's one of the most well - endowed finance -- well - financed organizations			0
and the techniques are spreading			0
" the @entity103 special representative to @entity1 , @entity104 , told the @entity105 that @entity18 's presence in @entity1 was " of concern , " but was most troubling in its " potential to offer an alternative flagpole to which otherwise isolated insurgent splinter groups can rally			1
" a senior @entity112 official told @entity2 that " the terrain is there " for @entity18 to grow in @entity1			1
this is " something everyone is keeping a very close eye on			0
@entity121 government is concerned , " he said , before adding that disaffected @entity36 might also be attracted to the group			1
the path to @entity2 's filming with the recruiter was complex			0
an @entity1 cameraman working for @entity2 was introduced at first to militants seeking to recruit fighters to assist an @entity131 - linked group in @entity15			1
weeks later it emerged they were in fact working for @entity18			0
the group the militants say they come from -- @entity136 -- is better known as a radical part of the @entity131 faction of @entity139 , in @entity15 , where many @entity1 fight			1
yet @entity18 experts say some of @entity136 's militants have defected to join @entity18 , and those defectors in turn sent recruiters to @entity1 to try to bolster their ranks			1
at the meeting that our cameraman was permitted to film , the militants produced application forms that bear the logo of the @entity153 -- the name the group prefers to be called -- although they appeared to be using the group 's older nomenclature of @entity18 on the documents			1
while these recruiters seek to attract fighters to @entity15 , their presence in @entity1 at this pivotal time will fuel fears that the country remains vulnerable to being used as a sanctuary for a new wave of extremists .			2

there 's no shortage of battle - hardened militants in @entity1 , writes @entity172 - @entity171
concerns are growing about how @entity18 may expand into the country
a senior @entity112 official fears disaffected @entity36 might be attracted to the group
