@entity2 a bill he is drafting would likely have a " profoundly negative impact " on the ongoing negotiations between the @entity10 and @entity11 over @entity13 's nuclear program			1
@entity4 is working on legislation that would force the @entity15 to submit any deal reached with @entity11 for a vote by @entity18			1
the @entity0 earlier threatened to veto such a measure			2
@entity0 chief of staff @entity21 , in the three page letter released publicly saturday evening , told @entity4 his legislation could be detrimental to the talks with @entity11 by " emboldening @entity11 hard - liners , inviting a counter-productive response from the @entity11 majiles ( @entity28 , the @entity29 ) ; differentiating the @entity10 position from our allies in the negotiations ; and once again calling into question our ability to negotiate this deal			1
" as the @entity10 and @entity11 prepare for the next round of negotiations this coming week , there has been a growing debate between @entity41 on @entity42 and the @entity15 about how much authority @entity18 has regarding the fate of the agreement			1
" the legislation you have introduced in the @entity5 goes well beyond ensuring that @entity18 has a role to play in any deal with @entity11			1
instead , the legislation would potentially prevent any deal from succeeding by suggesting that @entity18 must vote to ' approve ' any deal and by removing existing sanctions waiver authorities that have already been granted to the president , " @entity21 wrote			1
the chief of staff said that only @entity18 can terminate the existing @entity11 sanctions that are included in laws , but the president can relax some sanctions put into place by executive order unilaterally			1
one of the major issues between the @entity10 and @entity11 is the timetable for lifting of the sanctions			2
" if congressional action is perceived as preventing us from reaching a deal , it will create divisions within the international community , putting at risk the very international cooperation that has been essential to our ability to pressure @entity11			0
put simply , it would potentially make it impossible to secure international cooperation for additional sanctions , while putting at risk the existing multilateral sanctions " now in place , @entity21 said in his letter			0
for his part , @entity4 on sunday released a statement : " on this issue where @entity18 has played such a vital role , i believe it is very important that @entity18 appropriately weigh in before any final agreement is implemented			0
" @entity4 also urged the president not to go to the @entity90 for a vote regarding lifting of the sanctions on @entity11 , as @entity92 reported was being considered			2
" enabling the @entity90 to consider an agreement or portions of it , while simultaneously threatening to veto legislation that would enable @entity18 to do the same , is a direct affront to the @entity10 people and seeks to undermine @entity18 ' appropriate role , " he wrote			2
the chief of staff told @entity4 , " the @entity107 's request to the @entity18 is simple : let us complete the negotiations before the @entity18 acts on legislation " and added " we will aggressively seek public and congressional support for a deal -- if we reach one -- because we believe a good deal is far better than the alternatives available to the @entity10			1
" @entity21 also mentioned a separate letter sent to @entity11 's leadership and signed by 47 @entity41 senators			1
@entity4 did not sign it			0
the letter maintained that a future president could reverse some of what is agreed to in these ongoing negotiations and said any agreement reached would need congressional approval			0
it has generated much controversy			0
it also drew rebuttal from @entity11 's foreign minister , who called it a propaganda ploy			2
on sunday , @entity11 's speaker of parliament and former nuclear negotiator , @entity128 , said the letter signed by the senators tarnished @entity2 's reputation internationally , according to state - run @entity133 news agency			1
he said it showed that the @entity10 is untrustworthy , and he advised current negotiators to be wary			0
@entity21 also said the letter 's premise was incorrect			0
" non-binding agreements -- like the deal we are negotiating with @entity11 ... are an essential element of international diplomacy and do not require congressional approval , " @entity21 said			0
secretary of state @entity143 , who heads back to @entity144 on sunday for more talks with @entity11 representatives , again blasted that letter from the 47 republicans			2
" it is a direct interference with negotiations in the executive department , " he said at a news conference in @entity150			0
" it is completely without precedent , and it is almost inevitable it will raise questions in the minds of the folks with whom we are negotiating			0

a @entity41 senator is drafting legislation to allow @entity18 to vote on negotiations with @entity11
the @entity0 sent a letter saying it would further threaten talks over @entity13 's nuclear program
