kids , being kids , like to climb on things			1
more often than not , that 's ok			2
but when the thing in question is a war memorial ? that 's the question burning up online parenting groups and in family rooms after an amateur photographer snapped a picture of two children scampering on top of the @entity15 in @entity16			1
the photographer , @entity17 , described the shot on @entity19 as " two little brats climbing over war memorial right in front of a veteran			2
" the parents , he said , were laughing			1
" it actually drew a crowd of spectators and the parents realized how evil they were being and quickly took off before i could take a picture of them all , " @entity17 wrote			1
" the more i look at this photo the angrier i get			1
" he has plenty of company there			2
as the photo went viral , comment after comment poured in on @entity19 and @entity37 , chastising the parents for allowing the kids to play on the statue , part of the @entity42 that depicts three women tending to a wounded soldier			1
one nurse cradles the wounded fighter while another looks despairingly into an empty helmet			0
the third looks skyward , to a rescue helicopter or perhaps @entity51 , according to the memorial foundation 's website			0
in @entity17 's photo , a visitor to the memorial seems to grimace at the sight as he pushes an older man in a wheelchair			1
the older man , wearing a @entity62 ballcap , and a woman also look on			0
the children 's parents are n't shown			1
" disgusting , " @entity19 user @entity66 wrote of the children 's actions			1
" so wrong , " @entity37 user karsonwithak chimed in			0
but not everyone was upset			0
" i fully take why people can get annoyed and respect that , " @entity72 user z3k3 wrote			0
but the writer said a grandfather who was a veteran of @entity79 " loved watching the kids play on the local memorial			1
" " he saw it as a way for the next generation to take some joy out of something so terrible and at the same time gave them a link to the past as many would stop to read the names or even get interested enough to read up on the subject a little , " z3k3 wrote			0
fair enough , some said			0
but some memorials are meant to be interactive			0
and a statue depicting a nurse caring for a gravely wounded man just does n't seem to be the place for play , a @entity72 user with the screen name nickfree wrote			0
" unless the memorial is designed to be climbed on -- unless the message of the memorial is clearly ' use me , interact with me , to help carry my message ' ( e.g. memorial benches ) , the default is leave it respectfully alone , " nickfree wrote			0
on the @entity114 parenting blog , associate editor @entity112 wrote that " there 's nothing wrong with children who may not understand how gleefully playing all over a memorial may seem inappropriate to some			1
" " if these kids were just doing that -- gleefully playing all over a memorial -- i would n't find anything wrong with the image , actually			1
but they 're not , " she wrote			0
" these parents were disrespectful , " she wrote			2
" the kids were being kids and following their directives			2
" though the @entity132 , which operates the memorial , did n't immediately respond to a request for comment , the @entity131 urged visitors to treat veterans memorials -- sites of powerful and often emotional pilgrimages for many who served -- with respect			2
" please remember to be respectful to memorials honoring and remembering our nation 's veterans , " the group wrote on @entity19			2
" we hope our visitors understand this moving forward			0

a photo of children playing on @entity15 draws anger
many say the kids and their parents were showing disrespect to veterans
