@entity2 @entity1 prime minister @entity0 formally asked @entity4 to dissolve his country 's @entity5 on monday , opening the way for campaigning ahead of the may 7 general election			1
the procedural step means there are officially no members of @entity5 until it reconvenes on may 18 for the swearing - in of members and the official state opening of @entity5 on may 27			1
addressing media outside the official prime ministerial residence at 10 downing st. , @entity0 said that @entity1 had been " on the brink " when he came into office			1
" of course , we have n't fixed everything , but @entity1 is back on her feet again			2
" @entity0 said the nation faced " a stark choice " in 38 days			2
" the next prime minister walking through that door will be me or ( @entity27 leader ) @entity26 , " he said			1
" you can choose an economy that grows , that creates jobs , that generates the money to ensure a properly funded and improving @entity32 ( @entity33 ) ... and a government that will cut taxes for 30 million hard - working people ... or you can choose the economic chaos of @entity26 's @entity1 , " @entity0 said			1
" after five years of effort and sacrifice , @entity1 is on the right track			2
this election is about moving forward -- and as prime minister here at no. 10 that 's what i will deliver			1
" @entity26 launched @entity27 's @entity47 on monday , saying that a second @entity49 term would threaten @entity1 's @entity51 membership and pose " a clear and present danger " to @entity1 firms and prosperity			2
" there are two futures on offer at this election , " @entity26 said			0
" to carry on with a @entity49 plan based on the idea that as long as the richest and most powerful succeed , everyone else will be ok			0
or a @entity27 plan , a better plan , that says it is only when working people succeed that @entity1 succeeds			2
" @entity26 also referenced @entity0 's march 23 announcement that the @entity49 leader had ruled out standing for a third term -- before the election that will decide whether he even gets a second term in the top job -- saying the conservative candidates would be " vying against each other for who can be the most extreme on @entity73			2
" @entity0 and his @entity49 won the last election in 2010 , but not by enough to go into government alone			0
without a majority in @entity5 , a government becomes dependent on mps , or lawmakers , from other parties to get its program voted through the @entity82 , the chamber that passes laws and legislation			0
for five years , @entity0 has been governing in coalition with the @entity1 's third party , the @entity86			1
@entity86 , @entity86 leader and deputy prime minister , has mostly backed @entity0 in parliamentary debates against @entity27 's @entity26			1
" for the first time ever , the @entity86 go into this campaign with a record of action in government to be extremely proud of , " @entity86 said monday			0
" we have kept the government in the center ground and shown that we are the only party that can build a stronger economy and a fairer society			0
" the right - wing @entity1 @entity100 , or @entity101 , which has pledged to take the @entity1 out of the @entity51 , has made massive gains in the past year -- mostly at the expense of @entity0 's conservatives			1
last year , in a backlash against the @entity51 , @entity101 caused a political earthquake and won elections to the @entity5 in @entity1 , and some commentators have likened its impact on @entity1 politics to that of the tea party in the @entity113			1
it is unclear how @entity101 will perform in the may 7 @entity1 general election			1
some of its supporters appeared to be casting protest votes last year and could return to the established conservative and @entity27 parties when more is at stake			0
on monday , @entity101 leader @entity122 tweeted : " @entity101 is the party of real change for real people			0
if you # @entity126 on may 7th , you 'll get mps willing to hold the government to account			0
" meanwhile , in @entity130 , the september independence referendum ( which narrowly failed ) so reinvigorated the @entity131 that it could hit what is usually a key @entity27 stronghold , undermining @entity26 's bid for power			0
@entity131 leader @entity136 quit after the referendum , and @entity138 now heads the party			0
" the general election on may 7 is a fantastic opportunity for @entity130 to make @entity142 sit up and take notice , " @entity138 said monday			0
" by holding the balance of power in a hung @entity5 , @entity131 mps can work with others to lock @entity0 out of @entity147 -- and ensure that @entity130 's priorities become priorities at @entity142 , " she said			1
eligible @entity1 must be registered by april 20 to vote .			0
