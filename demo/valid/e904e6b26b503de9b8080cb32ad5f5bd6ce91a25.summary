wrapped up in a long brightly - colored scarf , which does little to contain her free - flowing curly hair , @entity0 sits back quietly as she tries to bring to mind her very first memory of music			1
" i was a kid , " the @entity7 singer finally says , her thoughts traveling back to @entity9 , the @entity10 city where she grew up			1
" while i was doing my domestic work in the house , sweeping , waking up at 5am in the morning , there was this bird [ singing ] -- and i never forgot the melody , " she continues , breaking a warm smile			0
" funny wise , like 25 years later i was in @entity19 and i heard the same melody -- it was amazing ! " @entity0 's first musical recollection might be firmly rooted in her birthplace , but the award - winning singer 's career was destined to begin thousands of miles away from home -- the daughter of a @entity7 father and a @entity31 mother , @entity0 moved to @entity32 at the age of 19 to study anthropology			1
whilst attending university , she also started exploring her musical talents , and soon found herself performing in various clubs opening up for top reggae and hip - hop names			2
in 2005 , she released " @entity40 , " a much - lauded debut that fused soulful beats , tasty hip - hop - and reflective ballads with politically - charged lyrics and black consciousness			2
since then , she went on to enjoy further chart success , tour extensively and collaborate with global stars like @entity50 and @entity51			0
and now , the soulful singer is back with a brand new , self - released album -- " my @entity63 " is a formidable collection of rich afrobeat grooves , reggae - tinged beats and uplifting rhythms that reaffirm her place as one of the continent 's most exciting -- and relevant -- artists			1
@entity1 's @entity64 caught up with @entity0 in @entity65 to talk about music , memories and the current situation in @entity7 -- as well as present her with the questions you sent via the # @entity71 and # @entity73 hashtags			1
@entity1 : in the past , you 've dealt with issues ranging from the environment and politics , to religion and love -- what are the themes that you 're emphasizing at this moment ? @entity0 : what is happening in @entity85 at present concerns me a lot			1
@entity88 has always been an issue obviously for the past five , six years -- funny wise , there 's a track in the album called " @entity93 " which i recorded when not too many people knew what was going with @entity88 in the @entity96			0
i 'm talking about the problems and possible solutions , and what are the reasons for the problems that we have			0
we as @entity7 , we 're not united , that has always been the issue ... that 's our problem , tribalism , and what belongs to whom			1
i also talk about children and the future , bringing children into this world ... everyone 's living in a cage and then you bring your child into that kind of society , where your child is forced to live in fear			0
people are afraid to express themselves politically , and even in their home -- i remember the way we grew up , i did n't look my father in the eye until i was 22 ; you call your father " sir , sir , sir " -- apparently it 's a form of respect , ok , but respect should not be mistaken with fear			0
i was afraid and that 's the thing , that 's the colonial mentality : we mistake fear for respect			0
he [ @entity138 ] says he wants to tackle @entity88 , obviously every @entity7 is asking why now , he could had done it a long time ago ... but i 'm not good at the whole blaming game , i do n't want to blame anybody but i pray that he comes up with a good idea for us if he is an honest and genuine guy			1
but i know that @entity145 [ @entity144 ] would definitely not be cool with him , @entity143 [ @entity144 ] is not cool with him , and many other musicians who are very outspoken are not cool with him			0
@entity1 : what is the power of music and how can it influence things to bring positive change ? @entity0 : music is very powerful , music is big ; music is even more powerful than politics at present			1
@entity154 would definitely draw more crowd than [ @entity7 president ] @entity138 if she was going to hold a speech -- if @entity154 is going to talk about @entity88 , many people are going to listen , and if she had something to tell @entity7 about love or whatever , many people are going to listen			1
@entity1 : how do you see the political and security situation now in @entity7 ? @entity0 : all i can say is that we do need proper leadership			1
yes , that 's just easier said than done , but we also need ourselves to take more things into our own hands -- so if we want change , we have to show that we want change , peacefully -- i love @entity173 but i 'd rather go for @entity174 [ @entity175 ] -- peacefully			0
and be part of it , not just blame our leaders and making sure that you , yourself , contribute to the change that you want to see			0
your questions @entity0 : my personal life always inspires me , in the first place , and then i try to expand it to the world			1
i try not to go too personal so that people can have their own interpretation of the song and also relate to it in their own special way			0
@entity0 : i like the prophet by @entity192 , i like @entity193 by @entity194 , i like the @entity195			2
right now i 'm reading @entity196 by @entity197			0
read ! just read , educate yourself ! @entity0 : the way forward is going to be easier said than done , but tribalism is not they key			2
what we need is unity and to appreciate each other as @entity7 , as @entity85 , regardless of tribe and regardless of religion -- imposing your religion on other people is only going to create war and turmoil , there has to be another way			2
@entity0 : being on tour for like five months ; i mean you get used to the life , but [ it 's hard ] when you 're coming back home and then realizing that people move on when you 're not around			2
@entity0 : it is successfully already , that 's why everybody is in it			2
that 's all i can say to that , it 's flourishing and they know it 's flourishing and that 's why they 're all there -- the @entity234 , the @entity235 , the @entity236 and the rest of them .			0
