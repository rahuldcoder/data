@entity6 the @entity1 ambassador who resigned his post in 2012 amidst official criticism that he used a private email account for official business told @entity7 friday that he was " very surprised " to learn that his boss at the time , then - secretary of state @entity8 , had been doing essentially the same thing at the same time			1
" i was very surprised to learn of the double standard , " former ambassador to @entity12 and @entity14 general @entity13 told @entity7			1
@entity13 noted that @entity22 , the then - @entity23 chief of staff " obviously knew secretary @entity8 was using commercial email , yet she stated my use of @entity19 was one of the reasons i had to move on			1
" the retired @entity14 major general , who flew 274 combat missions over @entity26 as a fighter pilot and served as president @entity29 's @entity28 to @entity30 , recalled he had been " prohibited from sending a @entity19 message to a @entity23 computer except in an emergency			1
" considering that " @entity35 dot mil accounts , @entity37 accounts , and every @entity12 account used the same routers and security firewalls as a @entity19 account , " he took issue with @entity23 protocols			1
" it did n't make sense to me that the @entity23 would ban my ' @entity19 ' while letting all other commercial and foreign accounts through its computer firewall , " he told @entity7			1
a spokesman for @entity8 declined comment			2
spokespeople at the @entity23 repeatedly declined to address whether any sort of double standard had been applied and instead continually noted that in the @entity23 inspector general report about the @entity1 embassy being run by @entity13 there were " several concerns with management and leadership " discussed , not just about his use of private email			1
the inspector general report charged that @entity13 " lost the respect and confidence of the staff to lead the mission " and " damaged the cohesion of @entity71 's country team			0
" @entity13 said he makes " no apology for ' rocking the boat ' in the @entity23 to improve physical security , to enhance cyber policy , and to conduct several other initiatives that the @entity23 inspector general misrepresented to build the case that secretary @entity8 's chief of staff used to terminate my tenure as the @entity1 ambassador in 2012			1
" the @entity23 's continued referencing of the other allegations against @entity13 came amidst fruitless attempts by @entity7 to ask the department spokespeople to explain why it was acceptable for @entity8 to use private email to conduct official business given that the 2012 inspector general 's report against @entity13 repeatedly hammered him for the use of " commercial email for official government business " which was considered to be " flouting of direct instructions to adhere to @entity23 policy			1
" as @entity7 reported thursday , the report stated clearly that it " is the @entity23 's general policy that normal day - to - day operations be conducted on an authorized information system , which has the proper level of security controls , " the report stated			2
" the use of unauthorized information systems increases the risk for data loss , phishing , and spoofing of email accounts , as well as inadequate protections for personally identifiable information			0
the use of unauthorized information systems can also result in the loss of official public records as these systems do not have approved record preservation or backup functions			0
conducting official business on non- @entity23 automated information systems must be limited to only maintaining communications during emergencies			2
" asked if he was subsequently surprised to see this controversy erupt about his then - boss doing essentially the same thing , @entity13 told @entity7 " i 'm not surprised when any political issue becomes a controversy			2
i learned long ago to do your best , do what was right , and to have a thick skin			0
i still wake up each day without regrets because i still have my integrity			0
that said , illegal , immoral , or unethical activities should be investigated properly , not just for political gain , but because we demand this of our public leaders			0
that 's the only way we can preserve trust in our system of governance			0
punish crimes and forgive mistakes			0
" @entity13 said that his " experience was somewhat different than secretary @entity8 's use of her commercial account , yet i was ' fired ' for the use of @entity19 in the @entity1 embassy , my insistence on improving our physical security posture , and other twisted and false allegations			1
i 've chosen to move on and to be better , not bitter			0
" he said that " the @entity23 inspector general investigators and @entity156 cyber investigators conducted a full and formal investigation into my use of @entity19 and the @entity23 computers " and " they dismissed the allegations against me			2
" the former ambassador and his wife currently live in @entity12 , where he is executive chairman of a company that works to bring international investment and innovation to @entity12 and @entity167			0
he is no longer involved in @entity1 politics and diplomacy .			0

*fmr* . ambassador forced to resign in 2012 amidst criticism over personal email use at the @entity23 .
claims accusations against him *unwarranted* . he took issue with @entity23 security protocol because they used the same firewall as @entity19 .
although his experience was somewhat different than @entity8 's , he was " was very surprised to learn of the double standard . "
