the story of the @entity1 in the @entity2 is a testament to " @entity2 exceptionalism " and stands in contrast to a long history of discrimination and pariah status in @entity9 and @entity11 lands			1
in fact , the economic prosperity and social standing of @entity2 's @entity1 shows that generally they have fared better than many other minorities			1
this positive record is a fulfillment of the assurance given to the @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 in 1790 by president @entity22 : " it is now no more that toleration is spoken of as if it were the indulgence of one class of people that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights , for , happily , the @entity31 ... gives to bigotry no sanction , to persecution no assistance			0
" since then , @entity2 @entity1 have been appointed and elected to public offices as governors , senators , mayors , @entity40 officers and in the military , and today , most @entity2 adults are unaware of and do n't seem to care who 's @entity1			1
thus it comes as a shock when at the @entity46 , a @entity1 woman student applicant for the @entity49 's @entity48 is initially rejected after being asked : " given that you are a @entity1 student and very active in the @entity1 community , how do you see yourself being able to maintain an unbiased view ? " according to the @entity62 , the discussion that followed had " seemed to echo the kind of questions , prejudices and tropes -- particularly about divided loyalties -- that have plagued @entity1 across the globe for centuries			1
" the minutes and video of the event suggest some student leaders seemed to be auditioning for the @entity68 witch trials and others for jobs as political commissars in communist @entity72			0
and in february , at another @entity46 campus in @entity79 , @entity1 students opposed to a @entity49 resolution advocating a boycott of @entity77 were heckled by cries of " @entity81 " and a @entity1 fraternity house was daubed with a swastika			1
chancellor @entity84 of @entity46 called the dust up on his campus a " teachable moment			2
it seems @entity46 's diverse body of students requires remedial classes in civics			0
would @entity46 students consider it appropriate to ask @entity2 @entity97 justices @entity95 and @entity98 similarly hostile and demeaning questions ? apparently it 's necessary for the university to teach its student leadership that the @entity2 @entity103 bans religious tests for public office			1
while they are at it , they also can inform them that the @entity110 assures freedom of religion , speech and assembly to all citizens			0
@entity116 's university administrators might need to be reminded that @entity117 of the @entity118 applies to all @entity2 , and they have an obligation to ensure equal educational opportunity for all students			1
this includes , among other things , promptly and effectively addressing certain hostile environments			0
as for the @entity127 students , they need to learn that support for @entity77 is a legitimate @entity2 tradition			1
a century ago , @entity132 asserted : " @entity133 is the @entity134 inspiration and impulse all over again ... to be good @entity2 , we must be better jews , and to be better jews , we must become @entity133			2
" students are of course free to disagree with @entity132 but not to harass or intimidate @entity1 who support his argument			1
the events in @entity116 might be regarded as isolated incidents and youthful excesses of the type that has always marked campus life			2
except of course that is not true			0
this type of hatred , stereotyping and bias is a worrying new development that suggests a generational problem			0
in our recent study , my @entity153 colleague , @entity155 , and i found that 54 % of @entity1 students reported experiencing or witnessing ant - @entity159 on campus during the six months of september 2013 - march 2014			1
our survey covered 1,157 @entity1 students on 55 campuses			1
the patterns and high rates of anti-semitism that were reported were surprising			2
another finding was that female students were more likely than males ( 58 % versus 51 % ) to report anti-semitism			2
jewish women seem more vulnerable on campus today			0
@entity2 's universities need to foster @entity2 exceptionalism and values			2
they should take special care to avoid following current " @entity9 fashion trends			0
" the situation in @entity181 today demonstrates the price of failing to nip youthful extremism in the bud			0
twenty years ago , complaints by @entity1 students in @entity187 that they were subject to @entity171 from a strange coalition of @entity189 , fascist and @entity191 groups were ignored by complacent university and government officials			1
the dangerous streets of @entity187 are witness to what results when a country ignores problems and panders to extremist opinions			0
the army is currently deployed across @entity181 to protect synagogues and jewish community buildings			0
but history has taught us what begins with the @entity1 does n't end with the @entity1			2
the @entity181 army also has to defend the nation 's shopping malls , government buildings and of course , its cartoonists .			0

@entity213 : @entity2 tradition of tolerance is *challenged* by incidents of @entity171 on campus
he says a *majority* of @entity1 students surveyed reported experiencing or witnessing anti-semitism
