the president repeated an unfortunate and ill - fated claim while campaigning hard for @entity3			1
" if you like your health care plan , you can keep it			2
" with that false sloganeering , @entity7 made sure he thoroughly owned a piece of the scorn spawned every time an insurance company changed or canceled plans after the @entity3 became law			1
he 's apologized , but history will record the affair as his " read my lips , no new taxes " moment yet , there are worse moves politicians can make			2
@entity24 are making one now			2
@entity24 leaders are stepping up to offer woefully inadequate stand - ins for @entity3			1
they 're offering these salves because they 're hoping the @entity28 issues a death blow to the federal exchanges that are now facilitating health coverage in 37 states and they want to have a possible alternative			1
there is plenty of potential the case , @entity34 v. @entity35 , will succeed in halting the insurance subsidies that federal exchanges require to function			1
the @entity24 leadership is smart			2
they understand some of the anxiety already percolating up now could transform into a true panic			2
but in trying to contain fear , they 're guaranteeing they 'll own the anger that comes next			2
a collection of three congressmen , including @entity52 chair @entity51 ( @entity53 ) , recently acknowledged the dire need for an alternative in the wake of @entity3 's demise and issued a " blueprint " that nods toward some of the key concepts			1
rather than subsidize the cost of heavily regulated insurance plans , this proposal would free up the market more , including more price variability , and offer tax credits to help defray the cost for people making up to three times the poverty level			2
in place of @entity73 expansion , the @entity24 plan would cap the federal @entity73 support , linking it to the @entity75			0
the plan effectively kills universal access by offering people a one - time chance to sign up for coverage , and it does n't require that anyone obtain coverage , making the individual insurance market unsustainable yet again as primarily those who already know they 're in ill health will flood the market and premiums will become unaffordable			1
if anything , the massive outreach campaigns required to push traffic to @entity91 demonstrate the difficulty in getting young , healthy people to act in their own best interests			0
while this outline potentially salvaged some semblance of the broad health care access the @entity3 is achieving , senator @entity51 showed his hand with a subsequent @entity100 op - ed he shared with two other senators			1
insisting that " republicans have a plan to help @entity106 harmed by the @entity108 's actions , " you might be forgiven if you did n't realize the harm was simply enforcing one 's civic duty to purchase affordable health insurance			1
instead , @entity51 and his colleagues hope to soften the blow by offering a transitional period so that marketplace health plans are n't immediately canceled after the @entity28 issues its ruling , expected in june			0
the senators would generously allow states to develop their own plans , something only the intellectual powerhouse of @entity124 managed to accomplish prior to the @entity3			1
with most of the affected 37 states having one or more government branches controlled by a party that preferred the status quo prior to the @entity3 , such state - level innovation is n't likely			1
@entity131 governor and distant @entity24 presidential hopeful @entity130 advocates a starker response : let 's roll out the welcome mat for the apocalypse			0
he argues that canceling the subsidies in all 50 states would reduce taxes by $ 48 billion , so canceling them in 37 states is a great start			0
@entity130 actually thinks the @entity28 's potential decision against the @entity3 presents republicans with an electoral " solution " -- the chance to bask in the glory earned by a massive tax cut			1
the @entity148 got a bit desperate in the run up to @entity3 , that much is clear from the poor vetting they applied to president 's own stock stump speeches			1
beyond his unclear rhetoric , they pushed the law through both chambers of @entity160 hurriedly and did n't allow it to receive the normal careful editing and revisions in a joint committee			0
the president leaped to sign the bill , warts and all , as it very well could have flitted away altogether			0
now one of those warts has turned cancerous			0
it surprised everyone involved with debating and covering the @entity3 at the time of its passage , including the lawyers behind this suit , to learn the bill erroneously specifies only state - run exchanges can dole out subsidies			1
yet in their giddiness over the law 's potential demise over its own inconsistencies , the @entity24 are getting sloppy too			0
the case is driven by a small nonprofit outfit called the @entity185 , which while it has tentacles throughout the @entity24 establishment , means that the case itself , at one point , could n't be blamed as the @entity24 's own strategy			1
but now that multiple @entity24 leaders have stepped up to offer these farfetched fix - it plans , and several leaders have even supplied the court with amicus briefs in support of the plaintiffs , there 's simply no separating the @entity24 itself from the @entity28 's decision in @entity34 v. @entity35			0
@entity24 are n't promising that you can keep your plan if you like it			0
they 're promising , that for millions of @entity106 now receiving their health care through the federal marketplace , you wo n't be able to keep any plan at all			0
over 9 million people would lose health insurance altogether if the plaintiffs win in @entity34 v. @entity35 , and many more will suffer due to the destabilized markets that in many cases will shut down altogether as rates skyrocket and insurers pull out			0
none of the @entity24 plans can realistically come together to fill the gap anytime soon , so a gulf will emerge between states with the political will to operate their own exchanges and the red and purple states that do n't have such fortitude			0
we suffered a rocky transition into the @entity3 , no question , but hospital systems , providers and patients are just now getting the lay of the land			1
we are seeing some great advantages , particularly in fields like mine			0
in rehabilitation medicine , we 're seeing that serious injuries that once blocked access to insurance are no longer a barrier			1
the @entity148 is n't making the mistake of owning what comes next			0
they 're frank : there are no contingency plans			0
republicans , apparently , want to own the next wave of insurance cancellations , while refusing to make a simple edit to a bill that for once guaranteed health care for the poor , injured and disabled			2
so be it -- 2016 is in sight .			0

@entity257 : @entity258 made errors in rush for @entity3 , but provided wide public access
@entity257 : republicans are pushing a case that would upend @entity3 , but their alternative would be a *disaster*
