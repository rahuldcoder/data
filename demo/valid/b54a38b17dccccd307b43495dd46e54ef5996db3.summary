life on a @entity3 ship in the @entity4 was no pleasure cruise			1
heat , humidity , the rigors of military life and bouts of boredom could frustrate a fella			2
so it may be no surprise that among the first artifacts to be brought up from the wreck of the @entity17 in @entity18 are two sets of leg irons			1
" we all know about discipline in the @entity26 , " said @entity21 , a project manager with @entity23 's @entity22			1
" it is for restricting the mobility of a prisoner who wanted to desert or had committed a crime			2
" of course , the leg irons could have been used on a @entity33 sailor or soldier taken captive			2
but that did n't occur with the @entity37 ironclad			2
it was scuttled in december 1864 , having never fired a shot in anger while it defended the city			1
about 400 artifacts have been brought up by divers in the initial stage of the recovery of the @entity17 , which must be moved for a deepening of the shipping channel			1
" we have scratched the surface as far as the artifacts are concerned			2
there are a lot more to come up , " @entity21 told @entity1 on thursday			2
@entity23 is working with the @entity53 in @entity18 to conserve many of the artifacts for eventual display			1
archaeology is n't just about cool artifacts			0
it 's about making a connection with the humans that used these items			2
and while experts have n't gleaned much about the daily life of the crew from the early dives , they have found some items that would have been used by an individual : an ironstone plate commonly used in the @entity4 , a musket trigger guard and the butt stock of a gun			0
visibility at the site is practically nonexistent			0
divers have to depend on feel to locate and remove smaller items			0
much of it is is detritus of the wreck : small iron plates , nails and spikes			0
among the items cataloged since the dives formally began at the end of january are two pieces that helped with the business end of the @entity17 : its cannons			1
four of the artillery pieces are amid the wreckage about 40 feet down on the floor of the @entity94			2
one iron piece had eyes , or holes , that connected a gun carriage to ropes that the ironclad 's crew manipulated to move the gun forward and backward			1
another piece , a trunnion cap , helped hold the cannon to the carriage			0
divers and archaeologists are following a timetable and grid in the recovery , with smaller items being brought up by hand			0
a previous salvage effort and damage from dredging displaced some of the artifacts			0
other items remain right where they fell			0
" someone undid the engine , moved it and was dropped " into the depths , said @entity21			2
contract divers are out on the site every day , weather permitting , not more than a couple miles east of the city 's famous @entity128 and waterfront			1
the $ 15 million removal of the @entity17 is necessary for the state and federal harbor deepening project , which will see the channel go from 42 to a uniform 47 feet so massive cargo container ships can use the port without relying on the tide			1
in june or july , @entity26 divers are expected be on site , to bring up the larger pieces : two engines , the propeller , a steam condenser , the four guns and the casemates that housed them			0
one of the casemates is large : 68 feet by 24 feet			0
four artillery shells will be recovered , with the @entity150 to render them safe for museum display			0
the wooden lower hull no longer exists			0
the @entity17 did n't have enough power to maneuver and effectively trade artillery rounds with any enemy vessels that might approach from the @entity157			1
instead , the vessel became a stationary floating battery , bristling with artillery pieces			0
the @entity161 refused to take on the @entity17 or other nearby defense obstructions			1
archaeologists have the challenge of preserving portions of the @entity17 through chemical and other means , making her iron stable so the remains one day can be displayed			1
conservation of selected artifacts and parts will be done at @entity23 and will take about two years to complete			0
state and local officials hope conserved pieces will be exhibited somewhere in the city			0
much of the @entity17 is corroded , and archaeologists are gauging the integrity of each piece for conservation			1
but many pieces remain in pretty good shape			0
an x-ray of one of the leg irons shows a fair bit of corrosion			0
experts will inject epoxy to fill those gaps and remove any concretion on the iron , said @entity21			0
officials need more artifacts and investigation to tell the story of the crew			0
" hopefully , there is a section of the wreck that will tell the human side of the @entity17 , " said @entity21			1
while salvage operations soon after the @entity3 removed a lot of iron from the site , there 's a chance personal items survive , especially if they are below the sediment line and protected from the ravages of oxygen			1
interestingly , the vessel 's crew had to run the main engine constantly , just to keep it afloat			2
why ? that 's because the @entity17 's green wood made it susceptible to leaks			1
so on december 21 , 1864 , just as union maj. gen. @entity223 's hordes of soldiers reached @entity18 , the ironclad 's crew likely opened its water valves			1
the @entity17 silently slipped below the surface			1
the sailors used small boats to get to shore and began a 20 - mile walk from @entity18			1
" they took what they could carry with them , " @entity21 said .			0

a @entity3 ironclad must be moved so the shipping channel can be deepened
wreckage lies a couple miles from @entity18 's famous @entity128
the @entity17 never fired a shot in anger during the @entity3
