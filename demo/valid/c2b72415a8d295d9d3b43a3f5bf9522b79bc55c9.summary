@entity1 this was supposed to be a rally led by @entity4 , had he lived two more days to see it			1
but after the @entity9 opposition figure was gunned down friday night , sunday 's rally in @entity1 took on a different theme			1
instead of gathering to criticize @entity9 's policies on @entity13 , thousands of people came together to mourn the death of the former deputy prime minister			1
and as they united near the site of @entity4 's death , conspiracy theories swirled over who killed the staunch critic of president @entity21 as he walked near the @entity22 with his @entity13 model companion			1
@entity13 president @entity24 added fuel to the conspiracists ' fire by saying saturday that @entity4 was about to reveal information that would be damaging to @entity9 interests , according to @entity30 , the state - run news agency			1
" a few weeks ago i had a conversation with him on how to build relations between @entity13 and @entity9 , as we would like them to be			1
@entity4 said that he was going to make public the strong evidence for participation of the @entity9 armed forces in @entity13			1
someone was very afraid of that			0
@entity4 was not afraid , the executioners were afraid			2
they killed him , " @entity30 quoted @entity24 as saying			0
@entity9 authorities originally declined to issue a permit for the march when it was billed as an opposition rally			1
but they agreed to allow the procession honoring @entity4 , said @entity52 leader @entity51			2
@entity4 was a top official in the party			2
the 55 - year - old was walking home from dinner with a companion , 23 - year - old @entity57 , when he was killed			0
the model later called @entity58 , a friend and political colleague of @entity4 's , and said several men had pulled up in a car , and one opened fire , @entity58 said			1
@entity9 tv station @entity65 spoke with a snowplow driver , who witnessed the immediate aftermath of the slaying			2
he was identified as " @entity70 " " i got on the bridge , looked into the rear mirror and saw a man on the ground			0
i immediately realized he did n't feel well			0
i drove a little bit further and pulled over , " the driver said			0
" i realized we needed to call the ambulance and police			0
" in a statement on its website , the @entity81 for the @entity9 said the shooter likely used a @entity9 - made @entity86 pistol and 9 mm shells were collected at the scene			2
police say they are looking for a man with short hair who stands between 5 - foot - 7 and 5 - foot - 9 , @entity9 's @entity90 news agency reported			1
the shooter was wearing blue jeans and a brown sweater			0
several possible motives were being investigated , the committee said , including the prospect that the shooting was a " provocation to destabilize the political situation in the country			0
" the committee is also exploring the possibility that the killing is related to the @entity109 terror attack in @entity110 or @entity4 's business activities , it said			1
the committee is offering a reward of 3 million rubles ( $ 49,000 ) for information about the crime , several media outlets reported			0
investigators interviewed @entity57 , who was not wounded			0
she was reportedly being kept under guard at an apartment , and @entity13 's @entity120 has requested that @entity57 be allowed to return to @entity13 , according to @entity121 , a @entity9 news agency			1
@entity21 quickly condemned the killing and ordered three law enforcement agencies to investigate the shooting , the @entity22 said in a statement			2
the president also wrote to @entity4 's mother saying he shared her grief and promised to bring those behind the killing to justice , the @entity22 said			1
but some of @entity4 's fellow critics suspect involvement by either @entity21 's administration or a supporter of the president			1
" it 's clearly a political murder			0
it 's definitely a contract one , " @entity58 said			0
" i do n't know who killed @entity4 , but i know that it 's the government and personally @entity21 who are responsible for it			1
they 've been constantly promoting a hatred towards everyone who does n't support their course and thinks different			0
" @entity21 had a different theory : that the killing was a contract hit , but one meant to fire up political strife , @entity21 's spokesman @entity153 said			1
@entity4 himself had said he was at risk for assassination			2
he told the @entity9 newspaper @entity158 last month that he was " a little bit " afraid his mother 's fears @entity21 would have him killed would come true			1
but , he added , " i 'm not afraid of him that much			0
if i was afraid i would n't be heading an opposition party and do what i 'm doing			0
" last year , @entity4 spoke to @entity2 's @entity165			1
" i 'm ( a ) well - known guy , and this is a safety because if something happens with me , it will be scandal not only in @entity1 city but throughout the world , " he said then			0
critics of @entity21 have in the past suffered miserable fates			2
last year , a @entity1 court sentenced five men to prison for the 2006 killing of @entity9 journalist and fierce @entity22 critic @entity179			1
business magnate @entity180 accused @entity21 of corruption and spent 10 years in prison and labor camps			2
@entity9 spy @entity184 accused state security services of organizing a coup to put @entity21 in power			1
he was poisoned by a lethal dose of radioactive polonium and died in @entity190 in 2006			0
no killer has been caught			0
and before his death , @entity4 had been arrested several times for speaking against @entity21 's government			1
the most recent arrests were in 2011 , when he protested the results of parliamentary elections , and in 2012 , when tens of thousands protested against @entity21			2
while @entity4 certainly had his share of enemies in @entity9 -- especially those who disagree with his stance on the @entity13 conflict -- many left notes for the slain politician on the bridge where he was killed			1
" to @entity4 , " one letter read , " thank you for your example of courage and honesty			2
" human rights activists did not mince words in assigning blame for @entity4 's murder			2
tweeted @entity215 , chairman of the @entity217 's @entity216 : " if you are popular your critics do n't have to be shot down in front of the @entity22			0
@entity21 is just food in a prison , eat it or starve			0
" in a column on how @entity4 had been harassed for his regular criticism of the @entity22 , @entity224 's @entity223 lambasted @entity153 , the @entity21 spokesman , for saying the killing appeared to be an attempt to destabilize @entity9 -- a statement @entity230 said could prejudice the investigation			1
" @entity9 has become the kind of place where a top opposition leader can be murdered just steps away from the president 's office , " she wrote			1
" a country in which people are told to hate one another for difference of opinions is a dangerous country to live in			0
" @entity242 and @entity243 reported from @entity1 ; @entity244 and @entity245 reported and wrote from @entity246			0
@entity2 's @entity247 in @entity1 and @entity248 in @entity190 contributed to this report .			0
