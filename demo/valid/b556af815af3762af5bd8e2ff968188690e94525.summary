what 's better than the sun on a march day in @entity3 , at the tail end of winter with spring on the doorstep ? no sun , apparently			1
that was the verdict of many around the continent , who found friday morning 's solar eclipse picture perfect			1
millions from around @entity14 , the @entity15 as well as @entity3 woke up with a chance to see the rare cosmic event			1
for some of them , it was a partial eclipse ; but others -- say if you were at the @entity23 , or in @entity24 or the @entity25 between @entity26 and @entity27 -- got the full deal			1
such eclipses are basically as old as the galaxy itself , happening when the moon and sun are at just the right distance from the @entity35 and they appear to be of the same apparent size in the sky -- even though the sun is actually about 400 times larger			1
an eclipse happens when the moon passes right in front of the sun , blocking the sunlight and casting a shadow on the @entity35			1
that means what used to be morning suddenly looks like nighttime again , until the sun and moon get out of each other 's way			1
staring at the sun anytime can be a bit dangerous , even when it 's there , not there , then there again during an eclipse			1
that 's where the term " eclipse blindness " -- which is really retinal burns -- comes from			2
luckily , a lot of those peering into the skies friday came prepared			0
at least that was the case for famous @entity68 footballers @entity66 and @entity69 , who looked cool looking up in their @entity71 movie - type glasses			0
or a bunch of children at @entity74 , a @entity75 school not far from @entity76			0
one of them looked more like a welder than a stargazer but did n't seem to mind , giving a thumbs - up to the view			2
not everyone was similarly enthused ; not because they do n't love a good eclipse , but because they do n't like a bad one			0
@entity0 's @entity89 in @entity90 , for instance , went out hoping for an out - of - this - world experience and instead saw little more than a bunch of clouds			2
he was n't alone , as many in @entity75 in particular did n't get the big show they 'd hoped for			0
clouds be damned , some folks there used a sun costume , along with an @entity35 - and - moon prop , to put on a show of their own			1
if the sun wo n't come out for you , then you might as well be the sun , their reasoning went			0
even in the @entity75 , whether you were @entity106 students cheering when a glimpse of the eclipse emerged from the clouds or a bird soaring the sky , there was a lot of enthusiasm for the eclipse			2
and there were even more cheers elsewhere , in @entity117 , @entity118 and beyond			0
@entity27 , especially , got some of the most spectacular perspectives			2
eclipses are n't everyday events , and they 're getting less common			0
while there will be more full eclipses , they will get rarer and rarer as the moon moves away from the @entity35 at a rate of about 3.8 centimeters ( about 1.5 inches ) every year			0
that means there will come a time when the moon will appear to be too small to cover the sun. but do n't sweat it just yet : @entity133 calculates this will take about 563 million years , meaning there 's still time to catch another eclipse			1
weather permitting , of course			0
@entity0 's @entity138 contributed to this report .			0

the moon blocks the sun , casts a shadow across parts of @entity3 , @entity14 and the @entity15
the view of the *resulting* eclipse is particularly *impressive* in places like @entity27
it 's also seen around @entity3 , though clouds obscure the views of many in @entity154
