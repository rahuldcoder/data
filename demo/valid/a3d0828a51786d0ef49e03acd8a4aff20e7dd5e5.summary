@entity1 's children have penned an open letter in the hope of " set [ ting ] the record straight on a few misconceptions " in the media 's coverage of their successful lawsuit against the writers of @entity12 's 2013 hit " @entity11			1
" @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity17 's joint letter mainly dives into the background and legacy of @entity1 's " @entity20 , " the 1977 single the court found to have been copied by @entity12 and co-writer @entity21			1

" like most artists , they could have licensed and secured the song for appropriate usage , " the family stated			2
" this did not happen			0
we would have welcomed a conversation with them before the release of their work			0
this also did not happen			0

following the court 's decision , the lawyer representing @entity1 's family has sought to halt all sales of " @entity11			1
" since the proceedings , the family had noted some similarities between @entity14 's " @entity82 " and @entity21 ' " happy , " though the family has confirmed in the open letter that they " have absolutely no claim whatsoever concerning ' happy			1
' " read the full open letter from @entity1 's children below : an @entity89 of @entity1 3/18/15 we want to extend our deepest appreciation and gratitude for the outpouring of love and support we have received from all of our father 's fans and friends , as well as artists and industry folks who contacted us surrounding the recent events concerning his song , " @entity20			1
" your kindness and encouragement gave us incredible strength and perseverance			0
we are so incredibly grateful for your support as well as the hard work and dedication of our amazing legal team and experts			0
we especially want to thank our mom @entity113 for her belief in what we were doing all along , and for her never ending support			0
we will celebrate what would have been our dad 's 76th birthday next month , and though we miss him every day -- just like the many thousands of well - wishers who have expressed their heartfelt goodwill - it is through his music that we find our compass and our paths moving forward			2
we are his children , but we too are his fans and we hold his music dear			2
it is in that spirit and on behalf of all those who @entity131 always considered an extended family , his fans , we take this opportunity to set the record straight on a few misconceptions echoing through some news and social media platforms about our intentions , our plans , and the so - called ' larger ' ramifications of this case within the music industry			2
originally released in 1977 , " @entity20 " became one of our dad 's most cherished hits , still a favorite at backyard barbecues , weddings , parties , on the radio , or on your @entity152			2
as @entity155 said , it is one of her " favorite party songs of all time			0
" the comments on social media , emails and calls we received after the verdict affirmed for us that the song continues to touch in even deeper ways , becoming part of the soundtrack to so many lives			0
" @entity20 " is also recognized by @entity170 as the fourth biggest single of the 30 charting hits our dad created during his extraordinary career			0
it has been nearly 38 years since its initial release : tastes change , trends evolve , but we should all be able to agree that it 's a testament to the enduring power of " @entity20 " that we have arrived at this juncture with mr. @entity12 and mr. @entity21 , at all			1
the fact that they have openly acknowledged their respect and admiration for the song is public knowledge , and further proof of its resonance with an entirely new generation of music fans			0
however , most songwriting begins with an organic approach ; a songwriter brings his or her influences to the table and then works creatively from a blank slate in the crafting of their song to ensure originality and the integrity of their creation			0
if mr. @entity12 and mr. @entity21 had tried to create a new song and coincidentally infused " @entity20 " into their work , instead of deliberately undertaking to " write a song with the same groove , " we would probably be having a different conversation			1
like most artists , they could have licensed and secured the song for appropriate usage ; a simple procedure usually arranged in advance of the song 's release			2
we would have welcomed a conversation with them before the release of their work			0
this also did not happen			0
instead of licensing our father 's song and giving him the appropriate songwriter credit , @entity12 and @entity21 released " @entity11 " and then filed a pre-emptive lawsuit against us , forcing us into court			1
they sought to quickly affirm that their song was " starkly different , " than " @entity20			0
" the judge denied their motion for @entity237 , and a jury was charged with determining the " extrinsic and intrinsic similarities " of the songs			0
we wanted to also make clear that the jury was not permitted to listen to the actual sound recording of " @entity20			0
" our dad 's powerful vocal performance of his own song along with unique background sounds were eliminated from the trial , and the copyright infringement was based entirely on the similarity of the basic musical compositions , not on " style , " or " feel , " or " era , " or " genre			1
" his song is so iconic that its basic composition stood strong			0
we feel this further amplifies the soundness of the verdict			0
like all music fans , we have an added appreciation for songs that touch us in mysterious ways			0
mr. @entity12 and mr. @entity21 certainly have a right to be inspired by " @entity20 " but as the jury ruled , they did not have the right to use it without permission as a blueprint for a track they were constructing			1
great artists like our dad intentionally build their music to last , but we as the caretakers of such treasures , have an obligation to be vigilant about preserving the integrity of the music so that future generations understand its origins and feel its effect as the artist intended , and to assure that it retains its value			0
we feel as many do that , our father , @entity1 , is an artist for the ages			1
but whether we 're talking about a work created 50 years ago or a work created 50 years from now -- protecting the legacy of original artistry is not a personal obligation , but a universal commitment in support of enduring creative achievement , encouraging future artists to also aim for new ground and their own legacies			0
that is what copyright laws help us do ; they give people the incentive to write original songs and then help protect those songs			2
our dad spent his life writing music - that is his legacy to us all - he wrote from his heart and was a brilliant songwriter , arranger , producer and one - of - a - kind vocalist			2
if he were alive today , we feel he would embrace the technology available to artists and the diverse music choices and spaces accessible to fans who can stream a song at a moment 's notice			1
but we also know he would be vigilant about safeguarding the artist 's rights ; a sacred devotion to not only the artist , but key in encouraging and supporting innovation			2
he also gave credit where credit is due			0
@entity328 , the attorney for mr. @entity12 and mr. @entity21 stated after the verdict : " we owe it to songwriters around the world to make sure this verdict does n't stand			1
my clients know they wrote the song ' @entity11 ' from their heart and souls and no other source			1
" we never for a minute suggested that mr. @entity12 and mr. @entity21 ' hearts were n't in it			1
but a jury of eight men and women have ruled that the source for " @entity11 " was the song " @entity20 , " a song our dad wrote from his heart , and delivered to the world with pure joy			1
with the digital age upon us , the threat of greater infringement looms for every artist			2
it is our wish that our dad 's legacy , and all great music , past , present , and future , be enjoyed and protected , with the knowledge that adhering to copyright standards assures our musical treasures will always be valued			1
and finally , we want to put to rest any rumors that we are contemplating claims against @entity21 for his song , " happy			1
" this is 100 % false			0
we have absolutely no claim whatsoever concerning " @entity368			2
" @entity369 and @entity370 , @entity14 , @entity15 , and @entity371 copyright Â© 2015 @entity372 .			1
