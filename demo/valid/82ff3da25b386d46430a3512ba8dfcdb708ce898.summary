@entity0 may have missed out on gold at last month 's world championships , but the @entity5 skier has set her sights on end - of - season glory after claiming a record - extending 65th @entity8 win on sunday			1
@entity0 's victory in the @entity11 event at @entity12 in @entity13 gave her the outright lead in the speed discipline ahead of this month 's finals in @entity18			1
having finished seventh in saturday 's downhill , the 30 - year - old rebounded by coming home 0.2 seconds ahead of overall @entity8 leader @entity22 , whose coach set up the course			1
it put @entity0 eight points ahead of super-g world champion @entity27 , who placed third to give back the 20 points she 'd earned over @entity22 the day before -- when their positions were reversed			1
" i think it was set probably against @entity27 , " said @entity0 , who took bronze behind @entity22 at last month 's world championships in @entity32			1
" that was a wise choice by @entity22 's coach			2
but it also really suited me and i liked it			0
" " it 's going to be a close fight in downhill and @entity11 , so i will really have to ski my best at the finals in @entity43			1
hopefully i can get two titles , " added @entity0 , who is 35 points ahead of @entity27 in the downhill standings			1
but @entity0 is well off the pace in the fight for the overall crown -- which she last won in 2012 , her fourth success -- in third place almost 200 points behind the @entity54			1
@entity22 is another 44 points ahead of @entity27 , with just two slalom events in @entity57 next week before the march 16 - 22 finale			1
" of course it 's a great result but i prefer to win , " the @entity59 said			2
" @entity0 was simply better today and she deserves this win			1
" my whole team stands behind me and supports me and i am really thankful to them			0
@entity64 did a great job setting the course			0
it was a fast and nice course set with not too many turns			0
" @entity27 , who also won the world giant slalom title at @entity70 , said she will focus on her strengths after claiming a 12th podium this season			2
" it was a fast super-g and that 's maybe not what i am the best at , " said the 25 - year - old			0
" overall it 's been a good weekend			0
honestly i thought @entity22 was going to be better than me in the downhill and that i would catch up in the super- @entity81 it turned out to be different			1
" i am focusing on my strengths , this is why i am not going to race slalom next week			0
now i have to train giant slalom in order to show my best skiing and maximize my chances to win the giant slalom globe			2
" meanwhile , @entity90 clinched the men 's @entity11 title with victory on home snow in in @entity95 on sunday			2
the @entity96 , who missed out on securing the downhill crystal globe when he finished seventh on saturday , opened up an unassailable 123 - point lead over @entity102 @entity101			1
" this is the first globe of my career , " said the 29 - year - old			2
" it 's good to not have to go into the final weekend feeling like there are two guys pushing me on the cup and i have to fend off both of them			0
that 's a big thing because i can leave the super-g and focus on the downhill			0
" @entity90 has a 20 - point lead over @entity117 in the downhill , but is less confident of overhauling his 52 - point deficit on another @entity54 , three - time defending champion @entity119 , in the overall standings			1
the men next travel to @entity59 for slalom events next weekend			0
" i think he will gain some extra points in @entity126 , so i 'm not very concerned about the overall , " @entity90 said of @entity119			0
" i think he 'll pull through			0
but it might get exciting			0
he has no room for error and anything can happen			0

@entity0 *notches* the 65th @entity8 win of her skiing career
@entity5 has an eight - point lead in @entity11 discipline ahead of finals
@entity0 bounces back after saturday *disappointment* in downhill
@entity22 and @entity27 are *battling* for overall @entity8 crown
