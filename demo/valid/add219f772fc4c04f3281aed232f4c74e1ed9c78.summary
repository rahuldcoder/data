@entity1 's military says its forces have retaken the northeastern town of @entity5 , which @entity7 militants last year declared the headquarters of their " caliphate			1
" the announcement comes on the eve of the @entity14 country 's general elections			1
" just this morning , the gallant troops of the @entity1 military in a concerted and well - coordinated land and air operations have liberated @entity5 , the headquarters of their so - called caliphate , " major general @entity15 said in a @entity17 statement friday			1
@entity15 said the troops had routed @entity7 fighters in towns and villages leading to @entity5			1
" several of the terrorists have died and many of them captured in the process			0
a lot of arms and ammunition have been recovered and the administrative headquarters completely destroyed			0
a massive cordon and search has commenced to locate any of the fleeing terrorists or hostages in their custody , " @entity15 said			0
@entity7 declared its own " caliphate " after seizing the area around @entity5 , in @entity42 , in august 2014 , according to the @entity43 think tank			1
the militant group has purportedly pledged allegiance to @entity48 and says its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of @entity52 law across @entity1 , which is split between the majority @entity54 north and the mostly @entity57 south			2
@entity1 's general elections take place saturday			1
the polls had been scheduled for february 14 , but on february 7 , @entity1 's election commission announced they would be postponed for six weeks due to security concerns , with the military needing more time to secure areas controlled by @entity7			1
the controversial decision was unpopular among many @entity1 and led to widespread protests			2
@entity1 president @entity67 , who is running for reelection , has been criticized for not doing enough to combat @entity7			1
on friday , @entity67 referenced the @entity5 victory in a broadcast to the nation , praising @entity1 's armed forces for their " immense sacrifices " in defending the nation			1
" we are also glad that our gallant armed forces have successfully stemmed the seizure of @entity1 territories in the northeast by the terrorist group , @entity7 , " @entity67 said			1
" they have recaptured most of the communities and territories formerly occupied by the insurgents , making it possible for thousands of internally displaced @entity1 to begin returning to their homes and communities			2
" @entity67 said security agencies were fully prepared to deal decisively with " any group or persons who attempt to disrupt the peaceful conduct of the elections			0
" " those who may harbor any intentions of testing our will by unleashing violence during the elections in order to advance their political ambitions should think again as all necessary measures have been put in place to ensure that any persons who breach the peace or cause public disorder during or after the elections are speedily apprehended and summarily dealt with according to our laws , " the president said			0
on thursday , @entity67 and maj. gen. @entity109 , the other leading presidential candidate , issued a pledge reaffirming their commitment to " free , fair and credible elections " following their signing of a nonviolence pledge -- the @entity117 -- in january			0
the @entity118 also issued a warning that anyone inciting or engaging in electoral violence " at a time when abhorrent levels of violence already plague parts of the country " is subject to prosecution , " either by @entity128 or by the @entity118			0
" " no one should doubt my @entity133 's resolve to prosecute individuals responsible for the commission of @entity118 crimes , whenever necessary , " @entity118 chief prosecutor @entity129 said in the statement			0
@entity7 attacks have killed at least 1,000 civilians so far this year , according to a @entity139 ( @entity139 ) statement released thursday			2
citing interviews with witnesses , it said the militants rounded up 300 @entity5 residents when it overran the town , then took them to a camp in the @entity149			1
" after five months during which other residents remained trapped on the hills , hiding in caves and weakened by hunger , @entity7 attacked the civilians there , killing many and forcing others to escape over the border into @entity159 , " the rights group said			2
" each week that passes we learn of more brutal @entity7 abuses against civilians , " said @entity139 researcher @entity160 , adding that @entity1 " needs to make protecting civilians a priority in military operations against @entity7			1
" the rights group said @entity1 security forces had " failed to take all feasible precautions to protect the civilian population " when fighting @entity7 but noted that , according to the government , military police were investigating those claims			1
@entity175 said in september that reports of alleged abuses by @entity1 security forces had increased since the government stepped up its fight against @entity7			1
the rights group alleged systemic use of torture by the police , based on hundreds of witness testimonies and other evidence gathered over a 10 - year span			0
a spokesman for the @entity188 disputed the claims , saying torture and abuse were not " repeat , not an official policy of the @entity188 " and that the @entity175 report contained " some blatant falsehoods			0
" earlier this month , @entity48 purportedly said it welcomed @entity7 after the latter pledged allegiance to it			2
in an audio message purportedly from an @entity48 spokesman , the group announced that it had accepted a pledge of allegiance from @entity7			2
@entity48 supporters posted the audio online			0
@entity2 can not independently authenticate the 28 - minute message			0
the message said that @entity48 , which calls itself the @entity206 , had expanded to @entity14 and congratulated " our jihadi brothers " there			2
it followed the posting online of an unauthenticated audio message purportedly from @entity7 's leader , @entity212 , on march 9 in which the speaker announced that the terror group wanted to join @entity48			1
since 2009 , @entity7 , whose name translates as " @entity222 education is sin , " has waged a campaign of terror aimed at instituting a stricter version of @entity52 law in @entity1			1
@entity7 's tactics have intensified in recent years , from battling @entity1 government soldiers to acts disproportionately affecting civilians -- such as raids on villages , mass kidnappings , assassinations , market bombings and attacks on churches and unaffiliated mosques			1
much of this violence has taken place in @entity1			2
but neighboring countries , such as @entity159 and @entity239 , have also been hit increasingly hard and have committed troops to fight the militants			0
an @entity243 - mandated @entity242 has also been formed , involving troops from @entity159 , @entity239 , @entity245 and @entity246 as well as @entity1			0
on friday , the @entity247 @entity133 announced @entity247 would provide 5 million pounds ( $ 7.4 million ) to help the task force tackle @entity7			0
foreign secretary @entity249 expressed hope that the @entity252 @entity251 would adopt a resolution , currently being negotiated , to endorse the task force			0
