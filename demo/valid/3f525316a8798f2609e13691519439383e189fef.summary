the image of the braided @entity3 female fighter , donning military camouflage and taking up arms against the militant group @entity6 , may have done more to promote the @entity3 cause in the @entity8 than anything else in recent years			1
the @entity10 @entity3 have long been pro-western in orientation , but @entity14 powers have often only moderately addressed their pleas for support , in part out of fear of empowering the secessionist minority to seek independence			2
now , with soccer moms in @entity23 tweeting photos of @entity3 female fighters , @entity14 governments may find it harder to explain their tepid @entity3 policies to their constituencies			1
@entity30 's sensitive photo essay brings much - needed nuance to the recent proliferation of images of @entity3 female fighters			1
since last summer , international media -- and @entity3 politicians who have recognized the public relations value of the images -- often objectified these women			2
images of smiling young female fighters brandishing weapons with a hint of glamour ( " girls with guns , " as @entity30 calls this type of portrayal ) tend to portray more of the photographer 's assumptions about the woman 's emancipation than her actual experiences as a @entity3 woman in combat			1
@entity30 consciously avoids this uncomplicated portrayal of female fighters			1
" i was wary of making images that fed into this idea of the heroic strong women fighters , " he said			2
" i think that the female fighters are used quite cynically by @entity3 leaders ( who ) know very well how attractive this image is to the @entity14 media			1
" having lived in @entity3 for nearly two years , @entity30 understands that many women join the @entity65 or other @entity3 forces for unglamorous reasons			1
many of the women he photographed turned to the @entity65 to escape abusive marriages or other forms of repression women continue to face there			2
social media follow @ @entity74 on @entity75 to join the conversation about photography			0
" a lot of the women 's backstories were quite difficult , " he said			0
" it seemed like this unit provided an alternative network for women who maybe would struggle in normal @entity3 society , because despite being relatively progressive ( within the @entity87 ) , it is still quite a conservative society			0
" @entity30 explores the theme of sisterhood , and in one image he captures the women in an intimate moment in the back of a pickup truck , their fingers intertwined			2
that photo , he says , is his favorite from the shoot			0
" i think that image is one of the more expressive ones that ( shows ) what really seems to be going on there , " he said			0
" i did n't want to take pictures that conveyed the idea that this was all about hardcore fighters going into battle and killing lots of ( @entity6 ) fighters			0
that just did n't seem to be the case			0
" @entity30 remarks that the image of the female fighter carries an important social role , conveying to the world the ( relatively ) progressive values that @entity3 pride themselves on			1
the women now serve a political role , too			1
as @entity14 governments eye more military engagement with @entity3 forces in @entity10 and @entity123 , these women may boost the @entity3 ' international standing			0
@entity30 is a photographer based in @entity125			0
you can follow him on @entity127 and @entity75 .			0
