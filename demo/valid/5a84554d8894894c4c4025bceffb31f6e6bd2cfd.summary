@entity0 said : " study the past if you would define the future			1
" in @entity5 , the past is glorious and long			2
this is where the world 's first cities were built and where writing and organized government were first developed more than 5,000 years ago			1
this is the land that gave the world its first great literary work -- the @entity15 , king of the city of @entity18 -- over 1,000 years before @entity19 , and over 2,000 years before @entity20			2
@entity23 , like so many iconoclastic extremist groups through history , seeks to destroy the record of the past			1
in the past week , video has circulated showing neatly dressed figures wielding rather new - looking sledgehammers and destroying archaeological objects in the @entity30			1
the spectacle would be ridiculous and pathetic if it were not so tragic			0
although there are suggestions that some objects destroyed are only copies , many are said to be unique and irreplaceable objects that had survived thousands of years -- until now			0
@entity23 has been busy trying to damage the famed @entity39 entry to the ancient city of @entity41 -- a city with a history reaching back thousands of years -- and most recently it is reportedly bulldozing the site of @entity45 , capital of the 9th - century @entity47 , and source of the famed @entity45 ivories			1
these ivories were first cleaned by none other than @entity51 while accompanying her archaeologist husband , @entity52 , during his excavation			0
all attacks on archaeological sites and artifacts are brutal assaults on our collective human memory			0
they deprive us of the evidence of human endeavors and achievements			0
the destruction eloquently speaks of the human folly and senseless violence that drives @entity23			1
the terror group is destroying the evidence of the great history of @entity5 ; it has to , as this history attests to a rich alternative to its barbaric nihilism			1
worse , these acts of destruction supposedly in the name of religion are dishonest and hypocritical : the same @entity23 also is busy looting archaeological sites to support its thriving illegal trade in antiquities , causing further incalculable harm			1
the smashed artifacts of the @entity30 and the destruction at @entity41 and @entity45 speak to a wider ignorance of archaeology and the meaning of the artifacts that archaeologists recover , study and preserve			2
these objects are the material record of humanity			0
they are not just for scholars , they are for everyone			0
they are the text of the past that helps define our future			1
archaeologists clearly need to do more to expand a global understanding of , and appreciation for , the heritage of the past			0
but it is not just a question for teachers , professors and museum curators ; there needs to be much greater awareness and protection of the past across society , in @entity5 , in the @entity114 and around the world , from the government to the public			2
we need more archaeology education globally ; in @entity5 and in other @entity23 - affected countries , but also among people everywhere in order to help communities -- from children on up -- understand the fragility of the archaeological record and its critical importance to understanding the human story			1
@entity129 , modern @entity5 , is at the heart of the human story : home of the first cities , states and empires			0
the law code of @entity136 , king of @entity138 over 3,700 years ago , is the first great legal text of the world ; it begins a heritage leading to @entity142 and the @entity143			2
the heritage of @entity5 is our heritage , too			0
what can we do in response to this assault on our heritage ? providing educational opportunities and empowering communities to learn more about their cultures and histories , and those of others , is one of the best ways to eradicate destructive hatred and violence .			0

@entity159 : video shows @entity23 destroying apparent antiquities ; they reflect rich history that is alternative to group 's barbaric nihilism
he says it 's key to teach importance of archaeology everywhere in world . antiquities are the text of the past that helps define our future .
