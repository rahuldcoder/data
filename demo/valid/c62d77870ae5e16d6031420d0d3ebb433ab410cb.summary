@entity1 's international governing body for a long time failed to tackle widespread and well - known doping problems in the sport and gave special treatment to @entity7 , according to a damning new report			1
the investigation by the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) slams the way the world body -- the @entity13 , or @entity13 -- operated over a lengthy period and calls for a series of changes to its governance			2
the report highlights multiple instances in which top @entity13 officials protected , defended and made decisions favorable to @entity7 despite concerns that he was doping			1
current @entity13 president @entity23 , who was elected to his post in september 2013 , told @entity2 monday that he had written to one of his predecessors , @entity27 @entity25 , to " consider his position " as the honorary president of the world governing body in the light of the findings			1
both @entity35 and @entity37 @entity36 , who @entity23 unseated , both come under intense scrutiny in the report for their dealings with @entity7			1
" @entity13 exempted @entity7 from rules , failed to target test him despite the suspicions , and publicly supported him against allegations of doping , even as late as 2012 , " it says			1
the @entity13 " saw @entity7 as the perfect choice to lead the sport 's renaissance " after a devastating doping scandal at the @entity52 , according to the report			1
" the fact that he was @entity55 opened up a new continent for the sport , he had beaten cancer and the media quickly made him a global star , " it says			0
but @entity7 's spectacular downfall in 2012 , which saw him stripped of his @entity63 titles and dropped by sponsors , helped intensify scrutiny over how he managed to get away with doping for so long			2
under @entity23 , the @entity13 set up the independent three - person commission to investigate the causes of doping in cycling and allegations that the @entity13 and other governing bodies were ineffective in their responses			1
in one case , the commission says , the @entity13 limited the scope of a supposedly independent investigation into allegations that @entity7 had tested positive in a drug test at the @entity79			1
@entity13 officials and @entity7 's team became heavily involved in the drafting of the investigation 's report , which was released in 2006			1
" the main goal was to ensure that the report reflected @entity13 's and @entity7 's personal conclusions , " the commission says			1
" the significant participation of @entity13 and @entity7 's team was never publicly acknowledged			2
" between 1992 and 2006 , @entity13 's top officials focused on protecting cycling 's reputation rather than trying to root out " endemic " doping practices of which they were well aware , the commission 's report says			1
" not only did @entity13 leadership publicly disregard the magnitude of the problem , but the policies put in place to combat doping were inadequate , " it says			2
the report highlights @entity36 's decision to allow @entity7 to participate in the @entity105 even though the cyclist had n't been in the testing group for the required period of time			2
the commission says although there is no direct evidence of an agreement between @entity36 and @entity7 , @entity36 " made a sudden u-turn and allowed @entity7 to return 13 days early " to take part in the competition , " despite advice from @entity13 staff not to make an exception			1
" " there was a temporal link between this decision , which was communicated to @entity13 staff in the morning , and the decision of @entity7 , which was notified to @entity36 later that same day , to participate in the @entity127 , an event run by people known to @entity36 , " the report says			1
the report says the commission found no evidence to support allegations of corruption over payments made to the @entity13 by @entity7			1
but it adds that " requesting and accepting donations from @entity7 , given the suspicions , left @entity13 open to criticism			2
" @entity2 was n't immediately able to reach @entity36 , but @entity25 issued a lengthy statement monday , claiming " wild conspiracy theories and accusations have been properly debunked once and for all			0
" he said : " i have studied the @entity10 report and i am satisfied that it confirms what i have always said : that there have never been any cover - ups , complicity or corruption in the @entity7 case or , indeed , in any other doping cases			2
" @entity7 , who cooperated with the commission 's investigation , thanked it for " seeking the truth and allowing me to assist in that search			1
" " i am deeply sorry for many things i have done			0
however , it is my hope that revealing the truth will lead to a bright , dope - free future for the sport i love , " he said in a statement			0
" in the rush to vilify @entity7 , many of the other equally culpable participants have been allowed to escape scrutiny , much less sanction , and many of the anti-doping ' enforcers ' have chosen to grandstand at @entity7 's expense rather than truly search for the truth , " said @entity7 's attorney , @entity164			0
the @entity176 , @entity176 , which banned @entity7 from cycling for life in 2012 , welcomed the commission 's work			2
" the report confirms that , for more than a decade , @entity13 leaders treated riders and teams unequally -- allowing some to be above the rules , " said @entity176 chief executive @entity181			1
" the @entity13 's favoritism and intentional failure to enforce the anti-doping rules offends the principles of fair play and is contrary to the values on which true sport is based			0
" @entity23 told @entity2 that the world governing body would be stepping up its fight against drugs cheats , working closely with the @entity197 ( @entity197 ) , national federations and , if necessary , law enforcement agencies			0
but the 63 - year - old @entity200 still believes cycling has taken strides forward in the fight against drugs cheats			0
" large numbers of riders are competing without doping , " he said			0
" i want to encourage them and support them			0
i think it 's possible to compete successfully in our sport without doping			0
" however , @entity23 reacted angrily to other aspects of the report , which suggested amateur cyclists and junior competitors were involved in doping			2
of older cyclists , competing in @entity219 categories , @entity23 gave a damning verdict			0
" the only people they are fooling is themselves , they are deluded , " he said			0
but his harshest words were reserved over allegations that drugs were being peddled to young cyclists			0
" the people involved should be subjected to criminal proceedings because that 's child abuse			0
i 'm astonished and appalled by those findings , " he said			0
@entity2 's @entity233 and @entity234 contributed to this report .			0
