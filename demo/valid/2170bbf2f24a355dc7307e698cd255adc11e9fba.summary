@entity1 police have revealed a threat to contaminate infant formula and other dairy formula with poison , in an apparent attempt to blackmail the government over its pest control policies			1
police appealed for public help to find the alleged blackmailer , at a press conference in @entity13 tuesday			2
they revealed an investigation had been underway since november , when anonymous letters were sent to giant dairy cooperative @entity17 and a farmers ' lobby group			2
the letters were accompanied by small packages of milk powder containing a concentrated form of 1080 ( sodium fluoroacetate ) , a poison used by @entity1 's @entity26 to control introduced pest species such as possums and rats			1
the letters threatened to contaminate infant and other formula with 1080 unless @entity1 stopped using the poison for pest control by the end of march , police said in a statement			1
the letters said the threat would be made public if the demand was not met			1
@entity1 's heavy use of 1080 -- it uses about 80 % of the world 's manufactured stocks , according the country 's @entity42 -- has been a controversial issue , with conservationists and farmers generally supporting the measure , and some hunters and animal rights activists opposed			1
primary industries minister @entity50 said the threat amounted to " eco-terrorism			2
" prime minister @entity53 said at a press conference that police had advised that there was a low likelihood of the threat being carried out			1
meanwhile , government officials said supplies of formula had not been contaminated , and urged consumers to continue using the products			1
" we are confident that @entity1 infant and other formula is just as safe today as it was before this threat was made , " said @entity64 , deputy director - general of the @entity65			1
" people should keep using it as they always have			0
" he said more than 40,000 samples had been taken without finding a trace of 1080 , and food security measures had also been boosted in response			0
these included a strengthened security measures in retail stores and a boosted presence at manufacturing sites , and enhanced milk and product testing , including the introduction of a test for 1080			0
" this criminal threat is designed to cause fear in order to generate a political outcome			0
it is using food as a vehicle but should not undermine confidence in our world - class food safety system or in any manufacturer , " he said			0
he urged consumers to check formula packaging for any signs of tampering as a result of the threat			1
police said an @entity107 - based investigation team was pursuing a number of lines of inquiry in locating the source of the threat , but the time was right to appeal to the public			1
" whilst there is a possibility that this threat is a hoax , we must treat the threat seriously and a priority investigation is underway , " said deputy commissioner @entity115			0
" you might be aware of someone who has strong views on the 1080 issue and made threats , or has discussed how to access supplies of 1080			0
" he also called on the alleged blackmailer to come forward			0
" the letter writer may not have really considered the implications of their actions when this communication was drafted			0
now is the time to put this right by picking up the phone and calling us			0
" @entity140 carries a maximum sentence of 14 years jail in @entity1			2
@entity1 is the world 's leading dairy exporter , and dairy cooperative @entity17 is the country 's biggest company , with revenue of $ 16.3 billion last year			2
ceo @entity148 described the threat in a press conference as " a despicable crime			0
" the global diary giant has been beset by problems before , most recently in 2013 , when it ordered a global recall of products -- including infant formula -- after fears they might contain bacteria that could cause botulism			1
the fears proved unfounded , as the bacteria detected was not a botulism - causing strain			0
@entity1 @entity164 chairman @entity163 said eyes were now on the response to the threat in key markets such as @entity169 , the biggest consumer of @entity1 dairy exports			1
" this could be extremely damaging for @entity1 's exports offshore , " he told @entity2 affiliate @entity172			2
" our whole reputation as an exporter of food is at risk because of this nutter			0
" trading in all @entity1 - listed dairy companies was halted tuesday with the announcement of the threat			1
@entity2 's @entity185 contributed to this report .			0
