an ancient ring has shed new light on the ties between @entity4 and the @entity6 world , more than a century after its discovery			1
the finger ring found in a 9th century @entity10 grave is inscribed with @entity12 writing			1
the letters appear to read " @entity16 , researchers say , which they interpret as meaning " for / to ( the approval of ) @entity15			1
" in a paper published in the journal @entity22 , the researchers say it is the only ring with an @entity25 inscription ever found at a @entity27 archaeological site			1
the object was originally discovered during a late 19th century grave excavation in the town of @entity31 , on @entity33 island , about 19 miles ( 30 kilometers ) from @entity34			0
@entity31 was a key trading center during the @entity36 and made a @entity37 in 1993			0
the ring is part of the @entity41 's collection , originally cataloged as being made of gilded silver and violet amethyst , bearing the inscription " @entity15			1
" researchers led by @entity47 biophysicist @entity46 say they used " scanning electron microscopy ( @entity49 ) with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy ( @entity51 ) to analyze the ring 's composition and found that it was in fact made of silver alloy and the " amethyst " was colored glass			1
" for the stone , we must remember that even though colored glass might today be perceived as a ' fake ' material of lower value , this was not necessarily so in the past , " the team cautioned			0
" even though glass production began around 5,000 years ago in the @entity67 it was still an exotic material in @entity68			0
" more significantly , the researchers found no trace of the gold that had been assumed to coat the ring and noted the presence of filing marks			1
" together with the absence of gold on the metal surface ... the file marks clearly show that the previous description of the ring as gilded was mistaken : if the surface had been gilt and the gold layer had worn away , also the file markings would be gone			2
but the metal surface displays no wear , and as the original file marks are still in place , this ring has never been much used			0
" the team , therefore , believes the ring was passed from an @entity25 silversmith to the woman , with few or any other owners in between			1
while imported coins were also found in the grave -- many from @entity97 -- they were " usually worn and torn ... from passing many hands along the established trade routes " researchers said			1
the owner of the ring was found wearing traditional @entity27 clothing , but the researchers said it was impossible to determine her ethnicity due to the decomposed state of the bones in the grave			1
" it is not impossible that the woman herself , or someone close to her , might have visited -- or even originate from -- the @entity115 ( which then stretched from @entity116 to the borders of @entity118 ) or its surrounding regions , " they said			0
while travel between the @entity6 caliphate and the @entity126 world was recorded in ancient texts , tales of such journeys often included references to " giants and dragons " making it hard to tell fact from fiction , the researchers said			2
" the importance of the studied @entity31 ring is that it most eloquently corroborates ancient tales about direct contacts between @entity138 and the @entity6 world			0
such contacts must have facilitated exchange of goods , culture , ideas , and news much more efficiently than indirect trade involving several merchants in - between , " they concluded			0
modern relationship this new evidence of ancient ties between the @entity4 and the caliphate comes at a time when @entity10 's relationship with the modern @entity6 world seems to be problematic			2
the country 's foreign minister , @entity156 , has recently come under scrutiny after criticizing human rights in @entity160			0
in january , she tweeted that the flogging of blogger @entity162 was " a cruel attempt to silence modern forms of expression , " which needed to be stopped			0
@entity160 blocked @entity156 from giving a speech to the @entity167 in @entity168 on march 9 , in which she planned to refer to human rights and the rights of women			0
@entity10 subsequently announced that it would not renew its memorandum of understanding with @entity160 on military cooperation -- and in turn @entity160 and the @entity177 withdrew their ambassadors to @entity10			2
the @entity177 said it had summoned @entity10 's ambassador to protest " the abusive remarks by the foreign minister of sweden , @entity156 , against @entity160			2

@entity10 researchers have used scanning to examine a ring found in a @entity126 grave
the ring carries an @entity25 inscription thought to be " for / to ( the approval of ) @entity15 , they say
their analysis *suggests* the ring was little worn , meaning trade ties could have been close
