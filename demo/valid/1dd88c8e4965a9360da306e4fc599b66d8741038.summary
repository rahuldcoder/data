how can i describe life in @entity3 after a year under @entity5 's control ? you start saying things like " let 's not talk about this on the phone " and become careful about the @entity12 pages you " like			1
" because total surveillance and control has become routine -- like it was in the @entity16			1
in just one year so much has been lost and many @entity17 seem to have forgotten rights that were part of everyone 's life			1
there is a growing level of censorship , inequality and political repression of those who do n't agree with the government			1
in everyday communication , @entity17 , including those who support @entity30 and @entity5 , have to think about what they do and say			1
thanks to the activities of the @entity35 ( @entity5 's secret police ) denunciation -- where a citizen tells the authorities about the wrongdoing of another -- is popular again			1
in the @entity16 , especially in the late 1930s , denunciations written by @entity16 citizens about their neighbors , friends and even relatives resulted in millions of victims in prisons and @entity49 camps			1
now in @entity3 , no one feels safe			1
anyone who does n't like you can write a denunciation and the next day you will take part in a " joyful " conversation with the security services			1
significant changes have also taking place in the most basic of rights , like freedom of movement			1
now , there are two borders manned by armed -- and sometimes angry -- men who always have questions about where you are going and why you want to pass			2
for ethnic @entity70 and @entity17 , things have been very difficult and thousands fled to mainland @entity70 in the first months after annexation			2
their fears were confirmed when @entity70 activists and young tatars began to disappear			2
some were later found dead , others are still missing			2
@entity70 patriots also left in the first month or two after occupation -- it would have been dangerous and uncomfortable to continue living on the peninsula			2
the next wave of migrants were those who hoped to adjust to the new rules , but could not			2
they started leaving when it became clear that things would get worse economically and politically			2
they have been replaced by a new set of arrivals from @entity5 : officials , police , fsb and other authorities			0
after annexation , many who had worked for the @entity70 government in the police , army and security services swapped allegiances to the @entity5 side			0
the @entity102 was happy to have them but has put special stamps the new recruit 's personal files , which say they are " inclined to betrayal			0
" one of the main arguments of @entity110 locals is that the average salary in @entity5 is much higher			0
indeed , since annexation , salaries have increased , especially in the public institutions like hospitals and schools			0
the salary increases caused a kind of post-referendum euphoria , which quickly fizzled in late 2014 when a strong dollar meant higher prices for everything from food to gadgets			0
then wages were cut again , by anywhere from 30 % to 70 % depending on the industry			0
many doctors and teachers were greatly dissatisfied with wage cuts , but no one protested because in @entity5 , you must obtain permission for a public assembly			0
of course , permission is mostly given to people or organizations loyal to the @entity102			1
@entity138 , a formerly dependable income source for many @entity17 , has been hit very hard			0
more than half of all tourists who used to visit @entity3 in the summer were @entity70 and last year tourism was down by 50 %			1
last summer , the peninsula was empty and many hotel owners had almost no customers			0
despite of the deteriorating economic and human rights situation , many of those who were for the annexation of @entity3 continue to support @entity5			1
as strange as it may sound , the harder life becomes here in @entity3 , the more people support @entity30 and hate @entity70			1
in a little over a year , the @entity5 propaganda machine has turned @entity70 from " brother state " to @entity5 's main enemy			0
for some @entity17 2014 was a year of tragedy and farewell to their homeland			0
others saw a dream realized			0
what things will look like in another year is unclear , but what is clear is that nothing will be the same again .			0

life under total surveillance and control now the norm in @entity3 , says writer
old @entity16 practice of denunciation has become *commonplace* , he says
he writes : the harder life gets in @entity3 , the more people support @entity30
