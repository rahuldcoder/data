@entity1 , @entity2 @entity0 , the @entity4 extremist group already blamed for numerous horrific attacks in @entity6 , posted a graphic video online monday showing the apparent beheadings of two men who the group said were suspected spies			1
the six - minute video shows two men with their arms tied to their backs			2
they are made to face the camera on their knees , with another man towering over one of them brandishing a knife			0
the knife - wielding man reaches toward the throat of one of the kneeling men , then the video switches scenes to show what appear to be the bloody severed heads of the two men placed on their headless bodies			0
the @entity34 , which monitors extremist activities , released a translated transcript from the video , including what site called an " interrogation " of one of the two men			2
the man identifies himself as a farmer from the @entity2 town of @entity43			0
he says he was told by a policeman that if he provided information about " the residents who live in here ... i will become rich and never go back to be a farmer again			0
" the apparent beheadings then follow on the video			0
@entity34 said the video , which included @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity55 subtitles , was posted online via @entity56 and " borrows certain elements from productions " of beheadings by @entity60			1
the video was posted by the media division of @entity0 , @entity34 said			1
although this is the first purported beheading video @entity0 posted online			1
‎ the group has previously issued more detailed and extremely violent beheading videos directly to journalists through intermediaries			1
unlike the video posted monday , previous ones have shown the actual decapitations			1
‎ in october 2014 , @entity0 handed out a 10 - minute video showing the decapitation of a @entity2 military pilot the group said it had seized a month earlier after shooting down his fighter jet during a mission against @entity0 in northeast @entity2			2
‎ in april 2014 , the @entity4 group released 16 - minute video showing what it said was the beheading of a soldier its fighters captured in a battle in @entity84 , the group 's main enclave			2
in february 2014 , another video showing the beheading of an alleged informant who led the military to a @entity0 camp in @entity84 forest during an offensive was issued by the group			1
and in february 2010 , @entity0 released a 12 - minute video in which two policemen were beheaded in an undisclosed location			0
those videos all ended with a speech from an " executioner " warning that the group would carry out similar punishment for anyone it captures supporting the @entity2 government against it			0
‎ @entity105 of @entity0 , which has inflicted years of terror on northern @entity2 , note that its actions in the past six months have frequently mimicked those of @entity60 -- from punishments such as stoning and beheading of its victims to taking territory and an increasingly sophisticated use of social media that 's very much in the @entity60 " style			1
" @entity116 , who follows @entity0 's operations and propaganda closely , recently told @entity3 , " it 's clear @entity0 is leaning toward @entity60 in terms of doctrine , ideology and an emphasis on holding territory after operations			1
" in terms of ideology , @entity0 's leader , @entity126 , has said that kidnappings and hostage - taking are approved in the @entity131 , a claim @entity60 also makes			1
" our hostages are @entity137 or corrupted @entity138 who follow the @entity140 way , " he said last year , referring to schoolgirls kidnapped in @entity135 , @entity2 , most of whom remain missing			0
@entity60 later referred to the @entity135 abductions in its kidnapping of hundreds of @entity144 women and girls			0
@entity116 and other analysts point out that recent @entity0 videos have resembled the polished media productions of @entity60			1
@entity116 notes they " have the same choreography and lens angles as @entity60			0
" @entity0 has begun using @entity60 symbolism in its media productions and operations			2
the @entity2 press noted with alarm last july that @entity0 militants had been seen raising @entity60 ' rayat al - uqab flag along the @entity2 - @entity160 border			2
recent videos have featured the same flag			0
@entity3 's @entity163 contributed to this report .			0

a video posted by @entity0 shows the apparent beheading of two men
the video is similar in style and content to beheading videos posted by @entity60
" it 's clear @entity0 is leaning toward @entity60 , " says an *expert* who monitors @entity0
