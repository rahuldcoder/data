under harsh lights in a private , rented room in @entity4 , women face each other in violent , sometimes bloody battles of brute strength			1
there are no official rules to this female fight club			1
the fighters are both beginners and professionals , anywhere from age 20 to 50 , said photographer @entity16 , who spent months documenting the club in 2013 and 2014			1
led by founders nicknamed @entity20 and @entity21 , a match might pit a bodybuilder against a martial arts master			2
they can wrestle , throw punches or " cat fight			2
" there 's no judge , just someone who knows the parameters they 've decided for the match			0
the small audience is mostly made up of men , but it 's a place for women to shed the roles they play outside			0
" when i saw this kind of fighting for the first time , i was quite shocked			0
i had never seen something like that before , and it was really interesting to experience all of this so close , " said @entity16 , who photographed the fight club as part of her work toward graduation from photography school			1
" inhibition and fear do not exist on the mat. " at first , @entity16 said , she shot the fight club in color , but the look of the blue mat and neon lights did n't satisfy her			1
she shifted to black - and - white images and reduced her point of view , getting as close as she could to the action			0
" it was not easy to work like that , because the matches were going very quickly and were unpredictable , " she said , although fighters were respectful and would stop if someone was seriously hurt			0
" i had to be very careful not to get hit			0
fortunately , there are chairs on the side , so i could jump on them if the female fighters suddenly rolled under my feet			2
" for all the aggression built into fighting , @entity16 said , the project required a lot of sensitivity			1
she had to work quickly , and she did n't always know her subjects well			0
the bouts , the motivations , the scene can all leave a lot of room for interpretation			0
@entity16 said she had to examine her own limitations , questioning " how far can i go ? do they trust me ? am i allowed to do that ? " social media follow @ @entity83 on @entity84 to join the conversation about photography			1
" i enjoy exploring new worlds , especially a world which exists in a gray area , " she said			1
she also had to remember that the fighters pushing and pummeling inside the club have lives outside , too -- they 're mothers , partners , friends			2
their actions on the mat might contradict how they live the rest of their lives			0
even years later , the fight club is still running and is " better than ever , " @entity16 said			1
" very often , i was very moved after seeing and editing the pictures , realizing what exactly happened there , " @entity16 said			2
" it is important to always remember my role as a photographer and to always approach the subject with interest and ( an open mind )			0
" @entity16 is a @entity109 photographer based in @entity4			1
