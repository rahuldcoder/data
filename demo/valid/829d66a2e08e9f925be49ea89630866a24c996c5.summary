the maker of a controversial documentary about rape in @entity3 , @entity4 , told @entity0 she is shocked by the @entity3 authorities ' move to ban the film without even having seen it			1
the storm over " @entity3 's daughter " blew up out of nowhere and is " based on nothing , " @entity4 said , in an interview for @entity0 's " @entity14 with @entity15			1
" " the tragedy here is it 's a missed opportunity for @entity3 to actually show by embracing the film ... to show the world that @entity3 is as concerned as the rest of the world is to put gender inequality on the agenda , " she said			1
the @entity24 documentary featured an interview with one of the men convicted in an infamous 2012 gang rape case in @entity29 that sparked massive outrage and protests in @entity3			1
an @entity3 court restricted the publication and airing of the film in @entity3 as well as the dissemination of excerpts from it after comments by @entity38 , the interviewed convict , were released in several media outlets			1
@entity38 appeared to show no remorse and blamed the rape victim for being out at night , according to the documentary			1
the government has also asked @entity45 to remove excerpts of the film from video sharing site @entity47			0
a @entity45 spokeswoman , @entity49 , said it would comply on the @entity3 @entity47 site , " as we are required to do so by the local law			2
" a statement from the company read : " while we believe that access to information is the foundation of a free society , and that services like @entity47 help people express themselves and share different points of view , we continue to remove content that is illegal or violates our community guidelines , once notified			0
" @entity4 told @entity0 the restrictions appear to have been motivated by fear of " public disorder			2
" " i presume they mean protests , " she said			0
it was , in fact , the street protests , not the brutality of the crime , that first inspired @entity4 to make the film			1
but @entity4 , who spent 16 hours interviewing @entity38 in prison over the course of three days , said the experience was chilling			2
" he told me everything that happened that night , he told me everything about his attitudes towards society , women , hanging , all sorts ... he blamed her -- the society blames girls , the society itself , " she said			0
" look here 's the thing : all this hysteria ... people must understand these men are products of a learned attitude			0
they are programmed , they are brainwashed			0
the society itself tells girls to stay indoors after dark			0
" @entity4 said she had done everything she could to elicit a human response from @entity38			2
she even had a list of the girl 's horrific rape - inflicted injuries , from which she died , read to him in @entity107 while she recorded his face			0
" there were a few twitches but there was no remorse , there was no emotion , i do n't think he is capable of emotion , " she said			0
@entity38 , who was driving the bus on which the girl was attacked while traveling home from the movies with a male friend , is now on death row and has filed an appeal			0
but all @entity38 says about how he , and the other men convicted over the rape , have been treated is to ask why such a fuss is being made about them when " everybody 's doing it , " @entity4 said			1
at the heart of the matter , she said , is the issue of gender inequality			1
from birth , boys in @entity3 and many other countries are accorded a higher status than girls , so it 's unsurprising that they go on to treat women as lesser beings			1
she compares gender inequality to a cancerous tumor that shows its spread through offenses against women			1
the dead girl 's father , who is also interviewed in the film , explained that in order to send his daughter to medical college , he sold a piece of ancestral land -- a big deal in @entity3 , @entity4 said			1
" when he did that , his whole family was in revolt , " said @entity4			2
" they said , ' why are you selling it to educate a girl ? ' " now that is a comment that is in the documentary , uttered by the father			0
why is nobody saying to me , ' how dare you put that comment in the documentary ' ? " in a statement , @entity3 's home minister said the documentary crew violated the conditions granting the jail interview , which stipulated that the authorities be shown all unedited footage			1
but @entity4 strongly rejected that claim			2
" it would appear that the home minister has been utterly misinformed , " she said			0
" the permissions to interview this man were absolutely cast iron and all of the conditions imposed by them were obeyed by me and my team			0
" @entity4 also speaks out for the " massive swaths of @entity3 people who are so forward looking , who are so embracing of change and are agents of that change			1
" there are extraordinary women 's groups who have been working for generations towards this change			2
those protests were so admirable -- that 's what took me out there			0
" and she stresses that the issues of gender inequality and sexual violence against women are not confined to @entity3			1
the film ends with a series of statistics on sexual violence from other countries , she said , including the @entity211 and @entity212			1
this means that " no viewer is is left off the hook at the end of the film in terms of thinking , ' this is something that happens to people over there			0
' this happens to us , to every country , " @entity4 said			2
@entity0 's @entity225 contributed to this report .			0

documentary maker @entity4 says she 's shocked by @entity3 authorities ' ban on showing her film
she says the ban is a " missed opportunity " for @entity3 to show it cares about equality for women
@entity4 says the root of the *problem* of sexual violence in @entity3 and elsewhere is gender inequality
