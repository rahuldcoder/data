the end of " jinx , " the six - part @entity1 documentary about real estate heir @entity2 , has launched a debate about whether some potentially incriminating statements @entity2 made while in the bathroom to a microphone may be used in his criminal prosecution			1
@entity2 , as you probably heard , is charged with murder in a killing in @entity14 15 years ago , and he has been suspected , but never charged , in the disappearance of his first wife in @entity17			1
whether or not the taped words of an accused person will be admissible against him involves a look at the rules of evidence and the @entity23 , as well as our fast - evolving ideas about privacy			2
while @entity2 's attorneys can make a number of arguments to suppress these statements and bar their admission at trial , the bathroom confessions will likely be factored in			1
let 's go over three main reasons why : 1			1
is this inadmissible hearsay ? probably not			2
hearsay is defined as a statement made outside of court that is offered in court for its truth			1
it really just means a witness ca n't testify at trial about someone else 's version of the facts			1
if a sentence starts with " he told me " or " she said that , " it 's probably hearsay			1
as general proposition , hearsay is supposed to be inadmissible , but the exceptions nearly swallow the rule itself -- so much so that many commentators have suggested abolishment of the exception - riddled rule itself			2
perhaps the largest and best known category of hearsay exceptions is admissions and confessions			2
these can be admitted against a defendant			0
why ? well , the idea is that these statements are reliable			1
the thinking is that people do n't ordinarily confess to something unless they did it			0
is this a violation of @entity2 's constitutional privilege against self - incrimination ? again , probably not			1
the rules of the @entity23 are a different matter			0
the @entity77 's self - incrimination clause states that " [ n ] o person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself ... " by definition then , compulsory self - incrimination requires , well , " compulsion			2
" and not just any compulsion			0
the kind of compulsion targeted by the @entity77 is governmental coercion			0
@entity2 may still contend that his " confession " was n't voluntary			1
it 's true that confessions deemed " involuntary " are often excluded at trial under the @entity92 of the 14th amendment			1
however , a confession will only be considered involuntary if it is the product of police activity			0
@entity96 is not an issue when admissions are made to a private person , such as a journalist			2
what of @entity2 's likely claim that the filmmakers were essentially acting as an arm of the police ? sometimes law enforcement exercises so much control over a civilian that his private actions become police action , constitutionally speaking			1
this is not an easy case for a defendant to make , though			0
@entity2 would have to establish that the @entity1 interviewers were direct agents of the police and that the interview was coerced by police			1
the police undoubtedly benefited from the work of these citizen documentarians			0
but the police frequently benefit from the work of good samaritans or citizens volunteering information , photos or @entity128 videos			0
the television show " @entity130 " has been premised on this idea for decades			0
given the defendant 's burden here , it 's unlikely that he can convince a judge that , in light of all the circumstances , filmmakers acted as an instrument or agent of police			2
the bottom line is this : a voluntary confession must be the product of a rational intellect and a free will , not physical intimidation or psychological pressure			0
how was @entity2 " pressured " when alone in the bathroom ? however , his attorneys might argue that some mental impairment rendered him incapable of the necessary rational intellect and free will			1
can @entity2 argue for some " reasonable expectation of privacy " that was violated by his being taped in the bathroom ? not in our modern world , and not in this case			1
perhaps in decades past , a court might be offended at an audio recording of someone in the bathroom , but things have changed			0
subjects of documentaries and reality tv stars alike routinely sign contracts allowing camera crews to pin a microphone to their lapels and follow them around 24 hours a day			0
moreover , everyone in the television news business has a story about some famous correspondent going to the bathroom and forgetting about their " hot " mic			0
in this brave new media world , the rule appears to be : you wear a lavalier microphone at your own risk			0
this is why defense attorneys tell clients to not give interviews			2
no matter how good an interviewee a client may be , audio and video editors have an uncanny knack for isolating the less than flattering sound bites			0
admitting to killing " them all " would fall into this category			0
when it comes to giving interviews , it 's probably better for defendants such as @entity2 to keep silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt , especially doubt of the reasonable kind .			1

@entity2 made some potentially incriminating statements at the end of @entity1 's " jinx "
@entity212 : @entity2 's attorneys will want to bar their admission at trial , but they will likely be factored in
