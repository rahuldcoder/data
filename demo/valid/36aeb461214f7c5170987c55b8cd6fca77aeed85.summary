@entity4 native to a remote region of @entity6 , this tiny mammal , known as the @entity1 , does n't know it 's a member of an endangered species -- and neither do most people			0
rarer -- and some would argue cuter -- than the panda , there are less than 1,000 of these teddy bear - like creatures living in the @entity16 mountain range in the @entity18 region of northwestern @entity6 , says conservationist @entity19			1
@entity19 discovered the pika , formally known as @entity1 , in 1983 and named it after his hometown , @entity22			1
last july , @entity19 spotted and photographed the elusive creature for the first time since the early 1990s			1
he estimates its numbers have declined by almost 70 % since its discovery			0
" i discovered the species , and i watched as it became endangered , " he told @entity3			0
" if it becomes extinct in front of me , i 'll feel so guilty			0
" in 2008 , the animal was listed as endangered by the @entity33 but there 's no official organization or team dedicated studying or protecting it , according to @entity19			1
the mammal , only 20 centimeters long , lives on sloping bare rock faces and feeds on grasses at high elevations			0
@entity19 says the pika 's habitat has been affected by global warming			1
due to rising temperatures , glaciers have receded and the altitude of permanent snow has risen in the @entity16 mountains , forcing the pikas to gradually retreat to mountain tops , @entity19 said			1
@entity22 pikas were originally found at elevations between 3,200 to 3,400 meters , he said			1
now they have retreated to elevations of 4,100 meters			0
" they have nowhere else to retreat , " he added			0
it 's also a solitary animal and is not as vocal as other pika species , so if predators are near , @entity22 pikas are not able to alert each other , @entity19 said			1
@entity61 may also be a factor in its decline			0
in 1983 , when @entity19 first came across the mammal , nobody knew what it was			1
two years later , @entity19 found another two and it was declared a new species			1
in the decade following , @entity19 and his colleagues conducted a number of studies , including a census at 14 different sites			1
however , in 1992 , @entity19 left @entity22 to work with @entity75 in the regional capital @entity77			1
no studies were conducted on @entity1 in the following decade			0
no one saw the pika , either			0
in 2002 and 2003 , @entity19 , with a team of volunteers , conducted a fresh census			1
despite spending 37 days searching the mountains for the pikas on seven separate trips , they came up empty handed			2
however , by analyzing droppings and snow tracks , @entity19 , along with @entity91 biologist @entity90 , was able to conclude that the ili pika population had seen a dramatic decline			1
together they calculated that there might be 2,000 mature animals , down from 2,900 in the early 1990s			0
the research , published in 2005 , recommended that the animal should be listed as endangered			0
in 2007 , @entity19 retired early to throw himself into searching for the pika			2
last year , he organized a group of 20 volunteers to conduct another survey with infrared cameras			2
this time , on the second day of the field trip , they finally spotted a pika , who jumped and stepped over @entity19 's feet while he was trying to photograph it			1
the volunteers dubbed it a " magic rabbit			0
" they concluded that there were fewer than 1,000 @entity22 pikas , said @entity19			1
" this tiny species could be extinct any time , " he said			2
" they do n't exist in the sites where they used to be anymore			0
" @entity19 funds the research with himself , along with donations and occasional grants from organizations like the @entity123			2
he says he has spent more than $ 32,000 of his own money over the past three decades and he has to raise funds to pay for gas			0
but what upsets @entity19 most is n't the lack of funding			2
it 's the lack of official recognition for the @entity22 , and other pikas ' plight			1
the @entity22 pika is n't included on @entity6 's @entity136 under @entity137 -- part of the country 's @entity139			2
the @entity141 , under the @entity142 , said it was in the process of updating the list but declined to give any further details			0
@entity19 and his volunteers have been calling for the establishment of a nature reserve to help protect the animal			2
" i 'm almost 60 , and soon i wo n't be able to climb the @entity16 , " he said			0
" so i really hope that an organization will have people study and protect the @entity1			0

there are less than 1000 @entity22 pikas in existence , says @entity19
it was photographed for the first time in two decades last year
