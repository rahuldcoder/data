@entity1 's @entity0 is one of the most prosperous places in the @entity5 -- home to tech giants such as @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10			1
yet even this region is n't immune from the scourge of child poverty			1
i visited @entity0 in november for @entity2 's @entity16 series			1
readers of this website voted for me to do a story on child poverty			1
there , i found children living in tents , homeless shelters -- even a garage , which i found particularly ironic given that @entity8 and @entity10 link their company origins to garages in this valley south of @entity29			2
instead of going on about all that 's wrong with @entity0 and this country as a whole , where one in five kids lives below the poverty line , i want to bring some good news : we can fix this			1
child poverty is n't inevitable			1
and we can choose to end it			1
here are four ways we can start to do that			2
if you do n't like these , go to this @entity8 form ( yeah , @entity8 ) and suggest a solution of your own			1
your ideas may end up in a future column			1
( @entity50 note : @entity8 declined to comment on " the poor kids of @entity0			2
" @entity9 and @entity10 , meanwhile , did not respond to my repeated email requests for comment			2
) the idea : housing is too expensive for poor families , especially in markets such as @entity0			2
but making affordable housing more available can reduce this burden			2
evidence it works : increasing federal housing subsidies would reduce @entity5 child poverty by 20.8 % , according to a 2015 @entity65 report			1
that would lift 2.3 million kids out of poverty			1
the annual cost would be $ 23.5 billion			2
for more info , read this report : " ending @entity72			2
" what you can do : support vetted @entity1 organizations that provide free or subsidized housing to low - income families , including @entity79 and @entity80			2
or : petition @entity9 , @entity10 or @entity8 to fund subsidized housing projects in their own backyard			0
the idea : working families ca n't afford to raise their kids , and better wages would help them do it			1
the federal minimum wage is worth considerably less now than it was in the 1960s , adjusted for inflation , according to the @entity91			0
the federal minimum wage was worth $ 9.27 in 1963 , using july 2013 dollars			0
now it 's $ 7.25			1
evidence it works : raising the federal minimum wage to $ 10.10 per hour , and boosting the tipped worker wage to $ 7.07 , could reduce @entity5 child poverty by 4 % , according to the @entity65 report			1
that would help lift 400,000 @entity5 kids out of poverty			1
to see how something like that plays out , i visited the @entity107 - @entity106 border			0
@entity107 's minimum wage is $ 7.25 per hour			1
@entity106 's is $ 9.47			1
the difference is $ 4,618 per year			0
on my visit , i met @entity111 , a 27 - year - old gas station worker			0
she told me that that wage difference is enough to help her two girls more comfortably -- and get off the @entity115 program			0
what you can do : petition for a $ 10.10 federal minimum wage			0
and learn more about minimum wage laws in your state			0
the idea : kids who attend high - quality preschools are more likely to graduate from high school and tend to earn more as adults			0
every child should have that chance			1
additionally , expanding child care subsidies could help			1
spending $ 5.3 billion would reduce @entity5 child poverty by 3 % , or 300,000 kids , according to the @entity65 report			1
evidence it works : meet the poorest kids in @entity135 , a country with a low child poverty rate and nearly universal enrollment in early education , starting at age 2			1
in @entity5 , meanwhile , despite advances in many states , only 40 % of 3 - year - olds are enrolled			1
( rates do go up for 4 - and 5 - year - olds , according to the @entity145			0
) petition in favor of " preschool for all			0
" or support these vetted groups : the idea : the thing poor families lack is money			0
give it to them and let them decide how to spend it			0
evidence it works : @entity160 , @entity161 , pays tribal members a biannual stipend , just for being alive			0
and social ills have declined			0
the money comes from a casino , which the @entity167 owns			0
in 1996 , the tribal council voted to distribute 50 % of the casino profits evenly among its 15,000 members , according to vice chief @entity172			0
a @entity174 researcher has been studying the impact of these payments for two decades			0
she follows 1,420 kids , comparing the lives of those who get the casino money with those who do n't			2
for the poorest families , a yearly $ 4,000 payment reduced by 22 % the odds that children would commit minor crimes by their late teens			0
the poorest kids were one grade year ahead when researchers checked in with them at 21			0
kids who were lifted out of poverty by the payments saw behavioral problems decrease by 40 %			2
for more info , read this op - ed : " the argument for the basic income			0
" what you can do : start a petition asking @entity203 to sponsor a " basic income " bill .			0
