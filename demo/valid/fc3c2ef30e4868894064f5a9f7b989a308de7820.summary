this weekend marked the official opening of " @entity2 , " the @entity4 debut of @entity5 of " @entity6 " and " @entity8 " fame			1
of course , the odd conventions of live theater mean that " fish " was n't quite fresh - to - table at its premiere : it 's been playing for several weeks now to sold - out preview crowds , to build buzz and iron out production kinks			2
and sold out really means sold out : the show has destroyed box office records for the vintage @entity21 and might yet set new ones for a nonmusical despite its limited run			2
that 's because @entity5 has a huge built - in audience for his unique brand of humor , which " @entity8 " fans know to be as abrasive as sea salt and as astringent as lemon , unyielding in the face of social niceties , epic humiliation or even common human decency			1
it 's polarizing , and the poles are pretty clearly drawn : by and large , fans of @entity5 's work tend to loudly proclaim that as long as abuse is sprayed pari passu -- e.g. , proportionately in all directions -- no one should take offense			1
the nonfans tend to respond that this kind of comedy rests on an assumption defined by another common @entity51 phrase , ceteris paribus -- e.g. , " all other things being equal			2
" and all other things are never equal in our world , by definition			0
when a group of affluent white protagonists in an almost exclusively white " @entity59 " behave badly toward a handful of cartoonish parodies of working - class ethnic nobodies ( a pretty fair synopsis of many " @entity6 " episodes ) , it 's hilarious if you belong to the former category			1
it 's much less so when you belong to the latter			2
so it 's not entirely surprising that some of the whispered early concerns with " fish " related to the character of @entity74 , the @entity75 maid of the late patriarch of @entity5 's fictional family , the @entity78			1
@entity74 , played by @entity79 , and her son @entity80 play a pivotal part in the show , which takes place in the immediate wake ( er , shiva ? ) of the passing of the elder @entity87 ; without spoiling the plot , suffice it to say that it hinges on upstairs - downstairs romantic antics and their inevitable consequences			2
and yes , some reviewers are using the " r " - word in calling out the depiction of @entity74 , eye - rolling over @entity94 ( @entity94 ) whose comic function is largely to mispronounce words and make cultural stumbles like bringing cuchifritos to a @entity101 memorial service			0
but the conversation about race and representation is n't , and should n't be , absolutist based on content ; context is just as important -- perhaps more so			0
what 's the threeway balance of power between the author , the actors and the intended audience ? are a performance 's questionable aspects racially exceptionalized ? does the role pivot on the ethnic identity of the characters and performers in a way that prevents them from being seen as more than just the color of their skin and the accent of their speech ? and finally , is the vehicle in which it 's taking place innovative , eye - opening , horizon - expanding , or does it reduce , repress and restrict ? as " fish " was finishing its preview run , a theater - world drama of another color was erupting nearby			2
the @entity135 , a nonprofit theater company that produces works from the traditional @entity4 canon featuring all - @entity139 casts , had announced its next production would be a big - budget , @entity139 adaptation of @entity143 and @entity145 's " @entity144 , " to be developed and directed by @entity4 wunderkind @entity146			1
the problem , as @entity139 actor and blogger @entity147 immediately called out , is that unlike @entity135 's prior projects , which have included shows such as " @entity152 ! " and " @entity153 , " " @entity144 " is set in the @entity154 , among the laborers and performers working on and about the @entity157 , a paddleboat theater offering entertainment to audiences up and down the @entity161			1
" this show ... is about the great racial divides within the @entity154 -- divides that are , without question , black and white , " wrote @entity147			0
" [ @entity166 ] were not ' toting that barge ' or ' lifting that bale '			0
@entity139 were not recovering from being ripped from their homeland and bound in chains due to the color of their skin			1
it is not ' our ' story to tell			0
" the fundamental mission of @entity135 and other theatrical companies that cast productions against type is twofold : they seek to showcase overlooked talent and to challenge the racial conventions of the aptly dubbed " @entity185 , " disrupting the notion that phenotypic reference points are necessary for a performer to believably portray a role			0
in that latter context , they 're exercises designed to highlight the fundamental magic of live theater : its power to get audiences to suspend disbelief			0
@entity135 's all - @entity139 " @entity144 " would seem to be not very different from the @entity199 's present production of " @entity200 , " featuring a multiracial set of @entity202 -- including @entity75 author and composer @entity204 as the titular @entity200 and @entity206 actor @entity205 as his rival , @entity207			1
and yet , there is a fundamental difference			0
having actors of color play characters written for white actors , who are cast in 79 % of all @entity4 roles ( by contrast , @entity139 and @entity210 are cast in just 3 % each and @entity206 in 14 % ) , is an act of disruptive defiance			1
having actors of color play characters written for other actors of color is shuffling deck chairs on the @entity223 at best and at worst , a categorically ill - conceived recipe for insensitivity			2
could @entity135 have weathered the spectacle of @entity139 performers speaking in @entity228 black dialect , performing a plot that 's entirely dependent on black history ? could an @entity231 have cut an @entity233 's hand , sucking her blood , then declared defiantly to an @entity139 sheriff that if @entity233 was a " mulatto , " so was he , because he now had " black blood " in him ? after a contentious town hall , in which numerous other performers of varied race and background expressed their vehement doubts , the @entity139 theatrical community , and ultimately @entity135 as well , decided it could n't			1
the context of the show , and the charged climate it would be arriving in , would make its content impossible to swallow			0
the costs of the cancellation are n't known , but they clearly are n't insignificant			0
but what , by contrast , of " fish " ? the reality is that @entity74 ( performed by @entity79 more or less as @entity79 ) does n't stand out as offensive when compared with the rest of the play 's characters ; for that matter , there 's nothing inherently @entity210 about the role , which , if the show had an unlimited run , could easily be recast as @entity139 , black or white , losing very little in the process			1
by contrast , nearly all of the rest of the cast fit familiar comedic portrayals of @entity101 family members -- most intensely so , the neurotic protagonist , @entity273 ( performed by @entity5 himself more or less as @entity5 )			1
the truth is , if non-jews were to put on a production of " @entity2 , " it would be difficult not to experience it as anti-semitic			0
these are the new and fascinating challenges presented by pop culture in our era of surging diversity , and they 're coming fast and furious from every direction			0
interesting times and sure to get more interesting still .			0

@entity5 's play opens on @entity4 , faces some *criticism* over a @entity210 character
@entity292 : an @entity139 group *rightly* cancels staging of " @entity144 "
