there can be no march without the madness			2
when it comes to college basketball , the first month of spring ushers in a frantic slew of games to determine seedings for one of the most fervently watched sporting events in the @entity11 , known simply as the @entity12 , or more often , @entity12			2
like @entity17 soccer 's @entity15 , much of the 68 - team tournament 's appeal is its egalitarian system of pitting traditional powerhouse programs like @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 against relative minnows like @entity24 's , @entity25 and @entity26			1
and both competitions offer the carrot of being able to impress scouts from top pro teams -- a first - round @entity32 pick can expect to earn anywhere from $ 755,000 to $ 5.75 million			1
not bad for a graduate			2
last year 's tournament reached 102 million viewers , while almost 740,000 fans attended the 36 sessions			1
" when you go to college , maybe your number one goal before you graduate is you want to be able to play in the @entity12 tournament , " says @entity39 , head coach and former player at @entity41 in @entity42 ( 28 - 5 , @entity44 champions )			1
" it 's the biggest stage for college basketball , and it 's one of the biggest national events in all of @entity11			2
" @entity39 knows just how big an impact that high - profile stage can have on aspiring professionals from beyond the major college ranks			1
his last - second shot for @entity41 to beat the @entity57 in the first round of the 1998 tournament is one of the most replayed moments in @entity12 history			1
how it works : selection sunday ( march 15 ) a 10 - member panel determines seedings for the 68 teams that make the knockout tournament @entity70 ( march 17 - 18 ) a format started in 2011 , 8 teams compete to qualify in the main draw second round ( march 19 - 20 ) 64 teams split into 4 regions : @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 # 1 plays # 16 in each group third round ( march 21 - 22 ) down to 32 teams regional semifinals ( march 26 - 27 ) known as the " @entity85 " regional finals ( march 28 - 29 ) the " @entity87 " national semifinals ( april 4 ) the " @entity92 " is played at @entity89 in @entity90 ; minimum capacity 70,000 @entity93 ( april 6 ) one of the most - watched events in @entity11 sport " i had always dreamed of winning the game in the @entity12 ( and ) always dreamed of making the last - second shot			1
for @entity99 to bless ( me ) with both of things at one time is something that i 'll always cherish and remember , " @entity39 says			1
his father , @entity103 , was @entity41 's coach at the time , and his brother @entity104 ( now men 's basketball coach at @entity106 ) was an assistant , completing the @entity108 scenario			2
" i do n't think any of us realized that they would show that replay the next year , and even the next year , and the next year			2
we were just so happy in the moment and never thought that we 'd be able to talk about it over a decade later , " he says			2
showing the highlight is virtually a prerequisite whenever @entity39 coaches a nationally televised game , and is sure to come up next week when his @entity117 play in the " @entity12 " ( one more nickname for the tournament			1
) @entity39 was a senior nearing graduation at the time			1
although he had heard about professional scouts attending his games , being drafted by an @entity32 team was still considered a longshot			1
after all , the last time a @entity41 graduate dribbled a basketball in the @entity32 was in 1956			2
but that was before " the shot			0
" although @entity39 says private workouts for pro teams solidified his spot as the first @entity41 player to be drafted in the @entity32 's first round ( as the 16th pick , ) he confesses that tournament attention is likely what got his foot in the door			1
" it helped me get my name out there , because they got to see me play against a different type of athlete in the @entity12 on a different stage , " he says			0
observing athletes during @entity12 -- when competition is at its highest level -- is the best way to gauge if they will succeed as pros , according to one player representative			0
" it definitely helps an agent to learn how a player will perform under a national stage , " says @entity152 , co-founder of @entity153 in @entity154 , @entity155			0
" if they want to play in the @entity32 , they are going to be expected to play under a tremendous amount of pressure and attention			0
" @entity165 , the second overall selection in the 2008 @entity32 draft , is one of @entity169 ' clients who has failed to live up to that pressure so far			0
now 26 , he recently found his way back to the @entity32 with the @entity171 after a spell in @entity173			0
@entity169 , a former player himself at little - known @entity175 who " had the unfortunate assignment of having to guard @entity39 , " says he enjoys recruiting clients from smaller programs because they lack the air of entitlement that can weigh on household names			1
" a lot of times they 've had to work their way into the spotlight , and so they develop a hard work ethic , " he says			0
" they really have an appreciation about what 's happened to them ; the more you can identify a talent with a level of high character , as an agent you 've just found a terrific prospect			0
" among the most successful small - program players in the @entity32 is former @entity26 standout @entity199 -- the current @entity200 frontrunner with the @entity201			1
@entity203 , who played at @entity204 and won two championships with the @entity171 , and @entity206 , a starting forward for the @entity202 , have also made their mark			0
@entity203 strikes a particular chord with @entity39 since they both came out of the unheralded @entity44 , a @entity209 conference made up of nine @entity77 schools			1
it was the less glamorous side of the game that set @entity203 apart from other prospects			0
" his defense is what helped him get drafted from our league , " says @entity39 , who suited up for four @entity32 teams in six seasons before playing in @entity218 and @entity219			1
" a lot of guys can score and shoot , but when you get to the @entity32 , really being able to defend someone separates you			0
" @entity206 led @entity25 -- a so - called " mid-major " program that exited the @entity44 two years ago -- all the way to the 2010 @entity232 against @entity20 , only to watch his desperation half - court shot narrowly miss at the buzzer			0
although @entity206 turned pro after the two - point loss , @entity25 's exposure to potential recruits allowed the @entity239 to return to the championship game the next year , and to the third round in 2013			1
with an enrollment of only 4,500 students , it is the smallest school to play in the final for over 30 years			0
in 2013 , @entity25 's 36 - year - old @entity246 became the youngest head coach in the @entity32 when he signed a $ 22 million contract with the @entity249			0
" even though they are so wildly successful as a team ( now , ) @entity25 right before that was n't well known , " says @entity169 , adding that it was @entity206 who first put it on the map			0
" you can find diamonds in these smaller schools			2
" @entity39 hopes to emulate @entity25 's past success this postseason			1
he 's already led @entity41 to its highest victory total and winning percentage in school history			0
led by 6 - foot - 10 - inch @entity265 senior @entity264 ( five blocked shots against @entity267 in the @entity44 tournament final ) and 6 ' 9 " sophomore @entity271 , the @entity117 are hoping for a high seed when a 10 - member committee meets this " selection sunday " to rank the tournament 's 68 participants			1
@entity41 's nightmare scenario would be an early - round pairing with last year 's runner - up @entity22			0
the @entity280 ( 31 - 0 ) aim to become the first team to go undefeated and win the national championship since the @entity283 in 1976			0
@entity39 calls coach @entity285 's team -- powered by a front line of 7 - footers @entity287 and @entity289 , along with 6 ' 11 " @entity290 -- as the deepest he 's ever seen in college basketball			1
six of @entity22 's players are considered worthy of june 's @entity32 draft			0
while @entity169 remains guarded about which college basketball players he 's scouting , inking deals with @entity22 players after the tournament is probably a longshot			2
" you talk about these smaller schools that are out there , we 're that way as a boutique agency , " he says .			0
