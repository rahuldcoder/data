from an iconic marble statue of a heavily pregnant disabled artist to the more recent giant blue cockerel , @entity2 's @entity1 art project has always provided a controversial modern twist to the traditional landmarks around @entity2 's @entity9			1
the latest offering , " @entity13 , " which took up residence in the @entity9 's northwest corner thursday , looks set to continue the tradition with a work that explores the link between power , money and history , according to organizers			1
unveiled by @entity2 's mayor @entity21 , the sculpture created by @entity24 - born conceptual artist @entity23 portrays a skeletal riderless horse with an ribbon - shaped electronic ticker tied to its left leg showing live market data from @entity2 's @entity29			1
" ' gift horse ' is a startlingly original comment on the relationship between art and commerce and i hope it will stimulate as much debate as other works that have appeared on the plinth , " @entity21 said			1
the 13 - feet high bronze skeleton is a " wry comment , " organizers say , on the equestrian statue of @entity41 originally planned , but never realized for the plinth more than 150 years ago			0
further nods to the past and the sculpture 's location can be found in the pose which is based on the engraving " @entity55 " by @entity50 artist @entity49 , whose famous equine portraits hang on the walls of the @entity53 on @entity9 's north side			1
one of @entity2 's most famous landmarks , @entity9 is popular with tourists			2
named after a famed 1805 @entity60 naval victory against the @entity61 , its centerpiece is a column commemorating lord @entity63 , who died during the conflict			0
in a career spanning half - a - century , @entity23 has frequently explored the interconnectedness of art , power and money through installations , paintings , photography and written text			2
many of @entity23 's most famous works have explored systems , be it physical -- as evidenced by his famous 1960s work " @entity79 " -- or the social and political as seen in " @entity81 " ( 1970 ) , " @entity82 " ( 1978 ) and more recently his " @entity83 " ( @entity84 ) installed in @entity24 's @entity85 in @entity86 in 2000			1
" it 's a very prominent spot , " said the 78 - year - old , reflecting on the " @entity13 's " positioning in @entity9 , " it 's very beautiful			1
" " there are other statues and the idea of having the empty plinth which has been made available periodically for artists is a great idea , " added @entity23			2
around @entity9 there was mixed reaction to the sculpture			2
" it definitely does n't look like a horse 's head , does it ? looks more dinosaur - ish to me , " said a slightly baffled female day - tripper from @entity104 , while another tourist seemed equally confused			0
" my first impression was that it looked like an alien , because you see it and then you think , huh ? what is it ? " said @entity113 , visiting from @entity114			0
local reaction was more positive though			0
" i just think it 's very witty , " said londoner @entity118			0
" i can see the ( @entity49 ) @entity49 influence			0
and i love the @entity29 ( ribbon ) scrolling round and the way they merge into each other			0
" " @entity13 " is the 10th artwork to sit on the plinth and follows the " @entity128 , " created by @entity24 artist @entity129 which was in residence from july 2013 to february this year .			1
