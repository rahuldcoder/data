as long as 7,000 years ago , the @entity1 people who lived along the desert coast of what is now @entity4 and @entity5 were mummifying the bodies of those who died			1
but , after millennia in which the mummies have remained well preserved , those ancient remains are now in danger of rapid decomposition , @entity10 scientists have warned			2
the culprit ? according to the @entity17 , in a news report published monday , rising humidity that helps microbes flourish on the mummies ' skin is to blame			1
as a result , scientists at the @entity26 's archeological museum in @entity27 , northern @entity4 , have already seen some of its 120 prized examples of @entity1 mummies start turning into a " black ooze , " it said			1
@entity35 dig unearths 3,600 - year - old mummy the role of rising humidity was confirmed through testing on skin samples by @entity10 professor @entity41 and researcher @entity42 , according to the news release			2
their findings will help conservationists in @entity27 -- an arid area where humidity levels have been increasing in recent years -- safeguard their precious relics			1
