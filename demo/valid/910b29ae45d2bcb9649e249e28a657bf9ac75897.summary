entertainers are paid for entertaining and it 's time athletes received financial recompense for taking part in the @entity6 , says 100m hurdler @entity7			1
in 2014,while the winner of @entity9 received $ 2,600,000 and the @entity10 champion picked up $ 1,620,000 , when @entity11 won gold in the @entity6 three years ago she received zero prize money			1
" people come for the entertainment from the athletes -- we are entertaining them , we are entertainers " the @entity17 , who set an @entity6 record of 12.48 seconds in her 2012 winning run in 2012 , told @entity1 anchor @entity21			1
" entertainers get paid every single time they step up onto a stage , and that 's exactly what we 're doing in a sporting sense			0
" billions might have tuned in to watch @entity30 's @entity29 which saw over 10,000 athletes compete across 302 events in a battle for golden glory , but the @entity36 's current policy is to ( @entity36 ) hand out gold , silver and bronze medals as well as a bouquet of flowers to athletes , but no financial remuneration			1
" i can see why they do n't , and i 'm sure they want to keep it like that , they want to keep it pure , " added @entity11			2
" to be honest we 're all still going to turn up whether we get paid or not			0
but the @entity51 would n't happen without the athletes			0
" it also would n't happen without sponsors			0
the @entity36 has just signed a new eight - year sponsorship deal with car manufacturing giant @entity56 -- reportedly worth just under $ 1 billion -- adding to their list of partners that include @entity59 's and @entity60			2
athletes usually fund themselves through sponsorship deals , government support , grants and part - time work			0
in 2012 only half of @entity68 track and field athletes -- who were ranked in the top 10 in their nation -- earned more than $ 15,000 a year from their sport			0
the fifth fastest 100m hurdler in history , @entity11 told the @entity17 's @entity75 in 2013 how a year after her olympic gold medal in @entity30 she still was n't attracting enough sponsors			1
no stranger to hard work -- the hurdler sometimes vomits after intense training sessions -- she decided to chase down her own deals rather than sit on her hands waiting for private sponsorship			0
while she has some support from @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 , appearance fees and prize money in the @entity90 -- an annual series of track and field meetings -- also provides revenue earning potential for the 28 - year - old			0
now targeting more medal success at the 2016 @entity97 , @entity11 achieved a resounding win at the @entity99 on march 7 with a time of 12.74s			1
even so the issue of @entity6 prize money still clearly grates			2
" i think the times have changed from 1896 to 2016 , i think it might be time to at least have a think about it , and discuss it because there 's no such thing as the @entity6 without athletics or athletes , " said @entity11 .			1
