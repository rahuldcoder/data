" @entity14 " remains one of the most controversial plays in @entity4 history -- when @entity6 's @entity5 lifted his foot and stepped on @entity9 's @entity8 during a critical moment of what has been called the greatest college basketball game ever played , the 1992 @entity13			1
mention @entity14 in a diner or bar in @entity9 and you best be prepared for a string of expletives -- from the blue - haired elders to the wealthiest thoroughbred trainers -- about how @entity5 is the vilest human on @entity23			1
then , the woulda , coulda , shouldas begin : laettner should 've been kicked out ; he should never have been in the game to hit that miraculous shot ; @entity9 should 've advanced to the @entity28			2
the @entity29 returned to headlines this week after @entity31 aired a " 30 for 30 " documentary called " i hate @entity5 , " detailing the life of one of the best players to ever play college ball and why he remains a lightning rod to this day			1
when it comes to @entity14 , @entity5 says he decided to give a " little payback " while @entity8 lay helpless on the ground			1
if @entity9 fans needed more reason to hate @entity5 , those words might 've been it			1
but on @entity45 , @entity5 issued a video apology to @entity8 , the first time he 'd ever done so : @entity8 could 've lashed back , but he 's too classy for that			1
he is one of the nicest guys you 'll ever meet			0
he remains active in basketball , coaching an eighth - grade girls travel - team in @entity53			0
( in full transparency , i coached with him last year			0
) he responded to @entity5 , saying he appreciates and accepts the apology			1
but he makes it clear where his loyalty lies			0
at the end of his 23 - second message , @entity8 's voice turns into a smooth baritone and he ends with : " @entity63			1
" @entity8 does n't dwell on @entity14			0
the thing he prefers to remember from that game was the honor of playing in it -- and the locker room speech by coach @entity69 after the game			1
@entity69 held up an old @entity72 cover that said the @entity9 program was in shambles			1
@entity69 told his players that although they lost on the court , his players had done something much bigger : they 'd put @entity9 basketball back on the map			1
" it put a lot of things in perspective , especially for a young team in a program that had just returned from heavy @entity4 sanctions , " @entity8 says			2
" all i remember is working with our heads down , attacking every practice and every game to the best of our ability			0
and that speech just reminded us of what was accomplished through that hard work , even in a loss			0
" that is a message , he says , that still resonates in his life : " sometimes you do n't see the full picture and do n't reap the immediate rewards of your work , but 9 times out of 10 good things do happen			0
" @entity8 has had fun with @entity14 over the years , even donning a " @entity112 " t - shirt that was given to him and posing with fans when @entity9 and @entity6 played a couple years ago			1
he jokes that he 's not sure if he was " a true hater " of @entity5 like so many others			2
but that game will never quite sit well with @entity9 players and fans			0
however , @entity8 says the documentary gave him a new perspective on @entity5 that he thought he 'd never have			2
" i can really respect his accomplishments , his basketball career and his passion for the game , " @entity8 says			0
do n't get him wrong			0
@entity8 still bleeds @entity9 blue			2
he 'd love to see @entity9 play @entity6 for the title this year , this time with the @entity125 walking away as the winners			2
face off against your favorite anchors in the @entity130 bracket challenge			0

@entity5 apologizes 23 years later for *stomping* on player
@entity8 accepts apology , but hopes @entity9 wins it all
@entity8 says he prefers to remember @entity69 's speech to team
the stomp remains a *bitterly* *divisive* play to this day
