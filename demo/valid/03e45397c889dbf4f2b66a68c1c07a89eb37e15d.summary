@entity0 has again voted for a national leader who acts as if he considers one - fifth of its country 's citizens -- including me and my family -- to be an existential threat			1
we were born into the wrong tribe , so to speak			0
campaign season shed light on the troubling reality in @entity0 -- that tribalism trumps democracy and ethnicity trumps citizenship			2
when @entity0 prime minister @entity20 warned that @entity21 were " being bused to the polling station in droves , " people around the world were justifiably horrified			1
and monday , in response to the outrage , he apologized for his statement , offering that he knew his comments " offended members of the @entity0 @entity21 community			1
" but @entity20 's policies speak much more loudly than his half - apology			2
and with him poised to serve a fourth term , many @entity33 citizens of @entity0 fear , with good reason , that his victory means it is open season for @entity40 racism in the @entity41 and in the streets			2
@entity0 's war on its @entity33 citizens is nothing new ; our rights have been under attack for years ( imagine a proposal that forced @entity51 @entity50 to sign a " loyalty oath " to the @entity50 as was proposed for @entity33 and other @entity54 citizens of @entity0 )			1
however , the majority 's attempt to further entrench institutionalized racism and deny the rights of indigenous @entity33 has achieved frightening momentum			2
the controversial " @entity60 " that previously floundered in the @entity41 has been resurrected			0
the bill , if passed , would codify the principle of preserving a @entity51 ethnic majority			0
there are versions of it that establish @entity67 as the sole official language and recognize @entity51 religious law as a " source of inspiration for the @entity41			0
" even @entity0 's @entity72 has come under attack in recent years for occasionally defending minority rights , which some view as a threat to the legal privileges afforded its @entity51 citizens			1
in response , the government changed the @entity72 's composition to tilt it further to the right			0
today , the sole @entity21 @entity72 justice , @entity84 , very often serves as a dissenting voice in judgments where the court favors legislation demeaning to @entity0 's @entity33 citizens			1
opinion : how @entity91 handed @entity20 victory the 2011 @entity93 — upheld in 2014 by the more conservative @entity72 , which includes the first @entity0 settler jurist — allows hundreds of localities in @entity0 to essentially reject applicants seeking to buy homes built on state land because the applicants are deemed " unsuitable			2
" the law caused an outcry among @entity33 citizens and human rights groups , who assert that it 's simply a thinly disguised effort to discriminate against @entity0 citizens on the basis of ethnicity			1
simply put , the law enforces segregation within @entity0 , helping to keep @entity33 citizens out of @entity51 communities			2
attempts to marginalize @entity33 citizens of @entity0 also extend to the political sphere			2
foreign minister @entity116 's successful push to raise the threshold required to win seats in the @entity41 was a move designed to exclude @entity33 lawmakers			0
ironically , that move backfired , prompting four @entity21 parties to create the @entity123 , whose members span a wide ideological spectrum			0
despite their political differences , they were united by one important mission , and that was to defend the rights of @entity33 , whether they reside within @entity0 or in the occupied territories			0
the @entity123 won 13 seats and took third place in the parliamentary election			0
while their unity and strong showing is encouraging in the face of @entity0 efforts to divide and weaken the @entity33 community , the fact that they were forced to unite on the basis of ethnicity rather than ideology is a reflection of @entity0 politics , which draws boundaries among its citizens on the basis of ethnicity and religion and openly participates in ugly , xenophobic electioneering			0
opinion : will @entity20 win seal @entity159 deal ? the @entity161 philosopher @entity160 once said that the essence of democracy is " to rule and be ruled in turn , " but as @entity165 , head of @entity166 : the @entity167 in @entity0 , puts it , in @entity0 , " arabs are always ruled and @entity21 citizens are always in the opposition , never in the coalition , no matter how many seats they win			1
" it is very telling that @entity20 could well form his coalition with @entity116 , who called for beheading disloyal @entity21 citizens of @entity0 and whose party @entity175 only won six seats in the @entity41 , and not with the @entity177 , which won more than twice as many seats and is calling for equality and an end to @entity0 's military occupation of @entity33 lands , which has lasted nearly half a century			1
if @entity20 's re-election is an ill omen for the @entity33 citizens of @entity0 , it is even worse news for the 4.5 million @entity33 under occupation who are ruled by a state that denies them all rights			1
when @entity20 said on the eve of the election that he would not allow the creation of a @entity33 state , he was making it clear that the occupation will continue as long as he remains in power			0
opinion : the danger of @entity20 's win renouncing @entity33 statehood rallied @entity20 's base by reminding them of how much he has done to preserve and extend @entity0 's grip on its @entity206 settlements , built in violation of international law and considered illegitimate by official @entity50 policy going back decades			1
in fact , blocking the creation of a @entity33 state has been @entity20 's life 's work			0
over the years , he has rhetorically " accepted " @entity33 statehood while continuing to steal the very land that would comprise a @entity33 state			0
the lip service he has paid to @entity33 statehood and his desire to return to the bankrupt " peace process " has provided him with a useful smokescreen behind which he continues to actively realize the vision he revealed in his recent political campaign when he ruled out a two - state solution -- a vision of a greater @entity0 where @entity33 live under apartheid rule , without a state and without equal rights the policies that @entity0 's electorate has chosen are directly at odds with @entity50 interests , not to mention @entity50 values			1
citizens around the world , including in the @entity50 , are increasingly frustrated with @entity0 's treatment of @entity33 and its role in helping to fuel armed conflict in the region , as demonstrated by its current effort to scuttle @entity50 - @entity159 nuclear talks			1
@entity20 is expecting to attempt to resume business as usual with @entity241 , offering occasional platitudes about peace in exchange for the freedom to deepen the occupation and strip away the rights of @entity0 's @entity33 citizens			1
given what is at stake , it will be dangerous for @entity50 -- and for @entity0 -- if president @entity91 plays along .			0

@entity252 : @entity20 showed his views during the closing days of the campaign
she says he favors policies that deny @entity0 's @entity21 citizens equal rights
