the case of a @entity3 woman , whose execution was postponed for a second time monday , is once again shining the national spotlight on one of the most fundamental questions we as a nation face : when do we put our own citizens to death ? but it 's an issue on which this country is all over the place			1
" as it relates to crimes against individuals ... the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim 's life was not taken			1
" that was justice @entity23 , writing for the majority in @entity25 ( 2008 )			0
you might think at first the @entity27 is n't listening			0
after all , the @entity29 federal government lists dozens of capital offenses that are punishable by death , and not all of them involve a victim 's life being taken			1
they fall into three main categories : 1 ) homicide offenses ; 2 ) espionage and treason ; and 3 ) nonhomicidal narcotics offenses			2
while most of them involve the death of a victim , not all of them do			2
but what happened to all that " should n't expand death penalty to crimes where the victim 's life was not taken " language from the @entity49 ? does n't the @entity27 have to listen to the @entity49 ? they do , and they have			1
the @entity27 has read the high court 's fine print in @entity25 : " our concern here is limited to crimes against individual persons			2
we do not address , for example , crimes defining and punishing treason , espionage , terrorism , and drug kingpin activity , which are offenses against the @entity63			0
as it relates to crimes against individuals , though , the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim 's life was not taken			1
as with most things , there are exceptions to the rule -- though reasonable minds may differ on the reasoning behind those exceptions			0
apparently , when we are talking about crimes against people , the death penalty should not be expanded to nonhomicide - type crimes			1
if it 's a crime against the state , well , it 's game on			0
after all , treason is one of three crimes mentioned in the @entity86 , so there 's a good argument that the federal statute authorizing death for treason is " constitutional " -- because it 's actually in the constitution			2
( yet another reason why federal court is not a place where defendants want to be -- it 's no secret defense attorneys would rather be in state court , where the penalties are less severe and where everything is n't illegal )			2
while it varies from state to state , as a very general proposition , the death penalty is almost universally reserved for the crime of murder			1
murder is a subcategory of the broader class of homicide , and death penalty crimes are normally a subcategory of murder			1
as another very general proposition in the @entity116 , murder -- plus something on top that makes it more egregious -- is what will qualify as a capital crime			0
it would be nice to say that capital murder in the states is always defined as an intentional killing , but even that has exceptions			0
in fact , in some states , you can be executed for a victim 's death even if you did n't actually pull the trigger and even if you never intended a death to result			2
if you commit an inherently dangerous felony , and a death results , you can be charged with " felony murder , " which in some states qualifies you for the death penalty			1
according to the @entity49 , this is constitutional , as long as the defendant significantly participated in the felony and was recklessly indifferent to human life			0
ultimately , it 's nearly impossible to articulate a simple rule for determining which crimes our society deems worthy of the death penalty			1
society 's view of the death penalty is constantly evolving , and so is the view of appropriate death penalty crimes			1
as a general rule , horrific murders qualify , but sometimes a nonhomicide crime such as espionage qualifies			0
if you are in the armed forces , even more crimes can get you executed , such as desertion			0
that 's particularly paradoxical that we might order our military personnel to intentionally kill in times of war and then execute them -- as was the case of pvt. @entity171 -- for refusing to intentionally participate in the killing			0
of course , we have long recognized that military justice requires a degree of martial discipline that the civilian world simply does n't			0
while the husband - wife execution of convicted spies ( and nonkillers ) @entity181 and @entity182 were certainly high profile at the time , the modern reality is that every person executed since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976 participated in a crime in which a victim died			1
so what exactly will earn you the death penalty ? the message is anything but clear			1
for crimes against the person , it has to be pretty awful : a killing plus something that makes it even worse than your garden variety homicide			0
if your crime is against the state , however , the @entity49 will give the state some leeway in killing citizens .			0
