an online group claiming affiliation with @entity3 terrorists has threatened @entity6 military members and their families in the past , and over the weekend , a new threat surfaced on the @entity9			1
a group calling itself the @entity11 posted the names , photos and addresses of about 100 @entity6 troops online , calling for attacks against them			1
the file , posted online saturday before being removed , claimed to have hacked military databases and said it was leaking 100 names " so that our brothers residing in @entity6 can deal with you			1
" the possibility of lone - wolf attacks in the @entity6 , the type that this message calls for , is a threat officials take seriously			1
a @entity6 law enforcement official said that all 100 or so troops named in the file are being contacted			1
it is believed that @entity34 members and sympathizers have been scouring social media sites trying to glean as much information as possible about service members , and have even threatened the spouses of military personnel online			1
one military wife recalls recently staying up all night and deleting every @entity43 picture of her children , every post that mentioned them or where they went to school			1
she googled herself , trying to figure out how easy it would be to find where the family lived			0
in the morning , she went to her car and scraped the military decal off the front window			2
as the spouse of a @entity56 soldier , she 's always tried to be conscious of how much she advertises that she and her three young children are a military family			1
" it 's hard because i am so proud of what my husband does , but lately so many spouses that i know are actually scared that they could be targets of @entity34 or someone who sympathizes with @entity34 , " she told @entity4 in january , asking that @entity4 keep her name out of the story for that reason			2
pro-isis hackers have never been responsible for a major cyber breach but some experts worry their capabilities are growing			0
@entity71 , co-author of " @entity72 , " told @entity4 , " there are indications some former members of @entity76 and @entity77 ( another hacking group ) are now hacking on behalf of @entity34			2
" the large majority of those within such hacking collectives are thought to hold very different views			0
in the wake of the attack against the @entity87 satirical magazine in @entity88 in january , hackers affiliated with @entity76 declared online war on @entity34 and @entity90			2
regarding this weekend 's threat targeting troops , the @entity93 notified the @entity92 named in the file , a @entity92 spokesman said			1
but the spokesman told @entity4 that the threat has yet to be verified			0
the @entity98 reminded service members to limit the amount of personal information they share online			2
on sunday , a @entity103 official told @entity4 that it can not confirm the validity of the posting of troops ' information , but said it is investigating			2
the @entity109 is also looking into the post , a law enforcement official told @entity4 , adding there are questions about the credibility of the person or persons who posted it			0
in january , military families were spooked by an online message on @entity121 's @entity120 account which was in all caps			1
it read : " american soldiers , we are coming			0
" the tweet included a link to a statement that said , in part , " we wo n't stop ! we know everything about you , your wives and children			0
@entity6 soldiers ! we 're watching you ! " the @entity120 hacker managed to post other threatening messages , propaganda videos and some military documents until the accounts were disabled			1
@entity121 quickly made public assurances that it was relatively easy to hack @entity120 , no serious security details were revealed and it would find who was behind the hack			0
@entity147 wife @entity146 said the messages just amplified the anxiety she already feels after recent terror attacks targeting military personnel , law enforcement officers and civilians			2
she and other family members told @entity4 in january that they first began to think about the possibility in may 2013 when a uniformed @entity156 soldier in @entity157 was murdered by two men who shouted " @entity159 , " or " @entity160 is great			0
" others started to fear the possibility of their service members or themselves being targeted after the killing of a @entity166 soldier during an october attack on the country 's @entity168			2
attacks and plots in @entity172 have them concerned , too , they said			0
in september , the @entity172 prime minister said a plot to kidnap a member of the public , behead the victim and then drape him or her in an @entity34 flag had been thwarted			0
in december , a self - styled @entity180 cleric held hostages in a @entity183 cafe for 17 hours , a drama that ended with the deaths of two hostages			0
the gunman , who was known for sending hate mail to military families , was killed			1
the slayings in @entity88 , for which @entity191 has taken responsibility , have prompted @entity193 to think about security at @entity196 's @entity195			2
" before the incident in @entity166 , i honestly did n't think @entity34 was a threat to our family or other military families , " she said in january			1
" i worry about the hundreds , thousands of folks going to and from work in uniform			0
they , too , could be targets			0
i think of other areas around the country where there 's a large military presence -- an attack , ambush , lone terrorist is something i fear			1
" i hate to say it , but i honestly no longer think if , but when and where , " she said			0
" i think it 's only a matter of time			1
" in late november , the @entity109 issued a warning to @entity6 military members that @entity34 was calling for attacks against them , a law enforcement source told @entity4			1
the source said that " overseas based individuals are looking for like - minded individuals in the @entity6 to carry out these attacks			1
" the warning asked members of the military to " review their online social media presence for any information that might attract the attention of violent extremists			1
" the bulletin also said authorities were concerned that @entity34 members were " spotting and assessing " individuals in the @entity6 who may be interested in carrying out attacks inside the country against members of the military , a @entity6 counterterror official told @entity4			1
@entity241 , who is married to a commanding officer , told @entity4 in january that she she knows military members and spouses who have stopped openly carrying their uniforms to their car after a visit to the dry cleaners			2
some have stopped wearing clothing with military insignia and are more careful when they open their wallet to avoid showing military ids or payment cards			2
the small , simple changes do n't mean military family members are running scared , @entity241 said			2
but it was difficult when her young daughter was watching television and saw the news about the @entity121 hack and the threat that @entity34 was coming for soldiers			0
" she turned and looked at me and you could see it registering -- we 're soldiers			0
she had a very worried look , " @entity241 said			0
" but kids are comforted by whatever their parents tell them			0
we ca n't live our lives in fear and we try to reassure them			0
" a blogger and communications firm ceo , @entity241 wondered how she would even begin to scrub her online presence			2
@entity280 also said in january that she 's thrown her hands up about the matter of online privacy			1
her memoir , " @entity284 " is a critical success			0
she 's done a lot of press and is omnipresent online			1
" i 'm probably screwed if @entity34 starts targeting yappy military spouses , so it 's too late now ! there 's also a part of me that thinks that 's what they want -- to make us always looking over our shoulders			1
so no. no to all of it , " she said			0
it 's a matter of principle , she and others said			0
why should families bend to fear and stop sharing online when social media has helped many of them get through 14 years of nonstop war ? though the military has at times struggled with how much freedom its members should have on social media , relatives have wholeheartedly embraced it			1
military families appear to use social media at higher rates than civilians , according to data from the @entity318			1
social media as we now know it was n't even around when the @entity322 war began			0
@entity43 launched in 2004 , almost exactly a year after the @entity6 invaded @entity323			1
now , dozens of military spouses have blogs and @entity43 caters to the community			0
a 2014 survey by military advocacy group @entity328 found that 75 % of 6,200 respondents considered the use of social media to be very important			1
@entity4 's @entity332 , @entity333 , @entity334 , @entity335 , @entity336 , @entity337 and @entity338 contributed to this report .			0
