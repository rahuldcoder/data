history has repeated itself at @entity2 with the surprise withdrawal of @entity4 from the semifinal due to a knee injury			1
@entity4 ' withdrawal comes 14 years after her sister @entity8 pulled out minutes before the semifinal in 2001 -- also with a knee injury -- a move which led to a tournament boycott , amid claims of racism , that only ended this year			1
@entity4 had been due to play @entity16 @entity15 on friday night , but instead posted news of her withdrawal on @entity19			1
" four months ago i began a journey to play @entity2 and it was amazing			2
i never dreamed i could do it			2
but i would not have been able to do this without my fans			2
though it ended early due to injury this year , i have to say i can not wait to try again next year			1
i love you so much ! " @entity4 posted			1
back in 2001 , crowds booed a young @entity4 as she took on @entity31 @entity30 in the final of the competition now known as the @entity2			1
despite being on home soil , spectators backed @entity30 in scenes former tennis champion and broadcaster @entity34 said were difficult to watch			2
" you would expect the crowd to be so supportive of the @entity42 player , so it clearly was the exact opposite			0
because she was @entity44 , because she was so young , because she was @entity44 , predominantly white audience			0
it was tough , it was tough to listen to , " @entity34 told @entity1 's @entity45			0
@entity34 watched as spectators booed @entity4 's father @entity48 and sister @entity8 , as they walked down the steps to take their seats for the match			1
" that 's when we realized this crowd is still really upset by what happened in the semifinals , " @entity34 said			0
minutes before the highly - anticipated semifinal between the two sisters , @entity8 pulled out due to a knee injury			1
her withdrawal seemed to add credence to rumors , which the family denies , that the result of the match had been pre-determined by their father , who kept a tight control on his daughters ' careers			0
despite the booing , @entity4 beat @entity30 to take the title			1
but the issue did not end there			0
days later , @entity75 gave a press conference and said the booing amounted to racial abuse , @entity79 , who covered the match for @entity81 told @entity45			0
" @entity75 had said that the n - word had been used and that the booing was racially motivated			2
... that was the beginning of @entity4 never coming back			1
" after 14 years of refusing to play at @entity2 , @entity4 , who with her sister has dominated the world rankings for more than a decade , said that she was " following her heart " by deciding to rejoin the tournament			1
" in order to forgive you have to be able to really let go of everything , " she told reporters at a pre-match news conference			0
@entity4 said she discussed it with her father in a " really emotional " conversation and he agreed			1
" he said it would be a big mistake if i did n't go back and i thought that was really admirable , " @entity4 said			2
before the match , she told reporters that , by returning , she felt like she 'd already won			0
" i do n't think i need to hold the trophy at the end of it			0
i feel like i 'm already holding the trophy			0
i 've never felt that way before , " she said			0
" just being here is a huge win not only for me but for so many people and it 's a wonderful feeling			0
" @entity4 ' early exit gives @entity15 a free pass to the final .			2
