as the world awaits a possible nuclear agreement between the @entity3 and @entity4 , let us not forget : this is the second time in two years that president @entity7 has pursued a nonproliferation deal with an unreformed regime in the @entity10			1
in doing so , he has ignored the regimes ' fundamental nature and the catastrophic costs these efforts have inflicted upon regional stability and @entity3 national security			2
this month brought familiar news : more chemical weapons attacks allegedly by dictator @entity19 against his fellow @entity20			1
just in june , the administration declared the success of its deal to remove @entity19 's chemical weapons , which had been prompted by his august 2013 sarin attacks on @entity20 civilians and the threat of @entity3 airstrikes in response			1
the deal did yield an important victory -- the removal and destruction of more than 1,200 metric tons of @entity19 's chemical weapons arsenal , which he can no longer use to threaten @entity20 and @entity35 or fall into terrorist hands			1
however , with his actions as evidence , it was a deal that @entity19 likely knew he could manipulate			0
even while the deal was underway , @entity19 continued to attack @entity20 civilians and the opposition with weaponized chlorine bombs , exploiting a loophole in the agreement			1
the deal was also fundamentally flawed in that it relied upon @entity19 to declare his stockpile voluntarily without sufficient third - party verification			0
just weeks after claiming success , the administration quietly acknowledged that @entity19 had secretly retained some of his most lethal chemical weapons			1
@entity53 has also failed to destroy some of his chemical weapons facilities , as the agreement required			1
the deal made @entity19 a partner of sorts to the administration despite the grisly , mass atrocities he continued to commit			2
during implementation , the administration limited its support to the moderate opposition and did little else to pressure the regime to restrain its attacks on civilians or to allow a political transition			2
about 50,000 more @entity20 were killed in the conflict during these months -- mostly at the hands of the regime -- and the displacement of millions of @entity20 throughout the region continued			1
meanwhile , @entity72 further exploited the civil war , expanding into security voids			0
there are several troubling parallels between the administration 's deal with @entity19 and the one it is now pursuing with @entity79			2
both represent deep cynicism or a fundamentally naïve understanding of the regimes with which we are negotiating			0
in both cases , the administration has tried to reach common ground with the world 's foremost sponsors of terrorist groups such as @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 -- which these regimes have funded , trained or sheltered			0
all of this was true before the administration started these negotiations , and it remains true today			0
neither @entity79 nor @entity19 has changed ways and chosen normalization with the international community			0
to the contrary , external factors forced them into situations in which they had to cooperate at least ostensibly on isolated issues -- @entity19 on chemical weapons due to threatened airstrikes and @entity79 on its nuclear program due to crippling sanctions			1
both have only reluctantly engaged and have taken steps to delay , obstruct and circumvent verifiable agreements			0
as continues to be the case with @entity19 , @entity79 has been emboldened by the administration 's approach			0
it has increased lethal support to @entity19 in @entity20 , deployed troops and supported sectarian militias in @entity119 , and ramped up aid to other militant groups , including the insurgent @entity122 in @entity123			2
these activities are now exacerbating the very humanitarian and terrorist crises that @entity4 helped cause by preventing political compromise in @entity119 and @entity20			1
as was the case with @entity19 , a deal will effectively make @entity79 a partner to the administration in which the @entity131 accepts the @entity4 regime 's legitimacy by virtue of the agreement			1
and there will still be little confidence that @entity79 will actually honor the terms of any deal it accepts			0
even while negotiations have been underway , @entity4 has been caught procuring illicit nuclear technology			1
the regime has a track record of concealing nuclear facilities and obstructing the @entity146 's access to others , including its infamous @entity149 base			0
as @entity146 director general @entity150 confirmed again this week , @entity79 has still only partially answered one of the @entity146 's long - standing , 12 questions on possible military dimensions of its passed nuclear activities			0
amid his continued calls for " death to @entity3 , " @entity4 's @entity155 , ayatollah @entity156 , tweeted his demand just last week that sanctions be lifted immediately as a part of any deal , not as a result of verified observance of a deal			1
@entity79 has demonstrated repeatedly that it will not allow verification of its passed activities or allow actual compliance to be a prerequisite for further sanctions relief			0
without a complete understanding of @entity4 's program , the international community does not have the information it needs for a responsible deal			2
a regime so committed to supporting terrorism , violently oppressing its own people and others , threatening @entity3 national security and destroying @entity35 can not be trusted			2
and without trust and verification there can be no acceptable deal			0
the world has witnessed the results of such a naïve arrangement before -- an unprecedented rise of terrorism , a grave humanitarian crisis and a blatant disregard for human life			0
we are seeing it once again in response to the administration 's efforts with @entity4			1
as we learned with @entity20 's @entity19 , making a deal with a terrorist - supporting tyrant yields disaster down the road			1
let 's not make that mistake twice .			0

@entity204 : @entity7 administration let @entity20 get away with continued chemical weapons *capability*
she says the @entity4 nuclear talks have the @entity3 heading down the same dangerous road
