@entity1 police moved with surprising speed to arrest five suspects , all of them @entity4 , in the killing of opposition figure @entity7			1
they tried to arrest a sixth suspect , but he reportedly threw a grenade at the arresting officers and then blew himself up			0
yet that speed has only raised more questions about who wanted @entity7 dead -- and why ? conspiracy theories are rife , but so far , none seem totally convincing			1
some members of @entity1 's opposition -- and @entity7 's daughter -- are convinced @entity1 's government was behind @entity7 's killing			1
but why ? and why now ? @entity7 , 55 , had been an opposition leader for years and had recently been overshadowed by younger members of the opposition such as @entity24			1
so killing him now does n't seem to make sense			2
some of @entity7 's supporters claim he had become a bigger threat to the @entity15 , pointing to information he was allegedly uncovering on @entity1 's military role in @entity30 that could undermine the @entity15 's claims that its forces fighting in @entity30 have been just " volunteers			1
" but the dramatic staging of the killing -- he was shot in the back on a famous @entity37 bridge against the backdrop of @entity39 and the @entity15 , where @entity40 has his office -- seems a bit too obvious			0
and how exactly does it help @entity40 to look like a killer ? the @entity45 did it			0
some @entity1 politicians and media personalities close to the @entity15 charge that @entity40 's foes in the @entity45 orchestrated the killing to damage the @entity1 president 's image and ignite a civil war in @entity1			1
but why would @entity55 want to destroy someone who was championing democracy and who is friendly to the @entity59 ? ( conspiracy theorists reply : to create a " sacrificial lamb " and blame the slaughter on @entity40			0
) it was the @entity4			0
here , the plot thickens			0
the key suspect , @entity65 , reportedly initially confessed to being involved with the shooting			0
but then , @entity1 media reported , he denied involvement			1
@entity1 officials have alleged that @entity65 , a former security officer and fervent muslim , decided to punish @entity7 for supporting the rights of the @entity74 @entity73 journalists to publish cartoons of the @entity76			1
but @entity7 's allies point out that he was not anti-muslim and rarely spoke of the cartoons -- he was by no means a central figure in the cartoon story			1
to make things more complicated , the strongman leader of @entity4 , @entity82 , praised @entity65 as a brave soldier , a religious man and a " real patriot			0
" but on tuesday , @entity40 awarded @entity82 the @entity87 , and the @entity4 leader pledged he would die for @entity40			0
a further twist is that @entity90 reportedly are fighting in @entity30 -- on both sides of the battle line ( for the @entity30 government and for the @entity1 - allied separatists			2
) that 's led some back to the theory that @entity7 was killed because of his allegedly explosive information on @entity1 's role in @entity30			1
many @entity1 are convinced that what they call the " fascist " @entity101 government would stop at nothing to frame @entity40			2
after all , a significant number of people , fed by domestic propaganda , still believe the @entity30 air force shot down @entity108 17 over @entity30 despite much of the evidence pointing to @entity1 - backed rebels as the culprits			2
supporters of this theory are mainly in the opposition camp			0
they accuse the @entity15 of whipping up hatred against the so - called @entity118 -- " traitors " who are trying to undermine @entity1 from within			2
photos of opposition leaders labeled " traitors " have been posted in @entity1 cities , while at an @entity124 rally in @entity37 just days before @entity7 's assassination , @entity1 loyal to @entity40 carried signs and placards with pictures of those " traitors , " including @entity7			1
but whatever the reality of what happened in @entity37 , high - profile killings in @entity1 , especially ones with a political connection , are rarely solved			2
chechens were convicted of killing journalist @entity137 , for example , but there still is no explanation of why they did it or who organized the murder			0
now , with @entity7 's killing , @entity1 officials and @entity15 - friendly media have whipped up a sandstorm of theories , confounding the most intrepid attempts at establishing the truth			1
will things play out any differently this time ?			0
