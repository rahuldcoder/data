@entity0 , @entity1 in an exclusive interview ahead of his @entity5 tour -- and ahead of his 10 - year wedding anniversary -- prince @entity9 paid tribute to the " brilliant " way his wife , @entity12 , @entity12 , has taken on the " real , real challenge " of defining her public role			1
" it 's always marvelous to have somebody who , you know , you feel understands and wants to encourage			0
although she certainly pokes fun if i get too serious about things			0
and all that helps , " prince @entity9 told @entity2			1
the couple first visited the @entity5 together as newlyweds in 2005 , and @entity12 was confronted by hardcore princess diana fans with abusive placards			1
polls at the time found that between 57 % and 73 % of @entity31 opposed @entity9 ' new wife being known as queen			1
if you go back even further , to 1997 , the year @entity36 died , an @entity35 poll put it at 86 %			0
reporter 's notebook : interviewing the royal couple but there 's been a change in sentiment since they married			0
a new poll conducted by @entity47 for @entity2 found that only 35 % now oppose @entity12 being known as queen			1
nearly one in four said they liked her more now than they did 10 years ago			0
this coincides with a change in palace strategy -- away from the aggressive spin machine of the 1990s to simply allowing @entity12 to be herself			2
when she appears in public , she 's either seen supporting her husband or promoting a set of causes she has a genuine connection with			0
prince @entity9 praised how his wife has handled herself			1
" she 's done an enormous amount for the whole issue around osteoporosis , which of course runs in her family , " he said , noting that @entity12 's mother and grandmother both suffered from the bone disease			2
he also points to other issues @entity12 is associated with , including literacy and preventing sexual violence			2
the @entity12 , by sticking to what she knows and cares about , is able to connect with the people she meets , which does n't always come across on camera			2
when @entity9 and @entity12 married in 2005 , there was huge sensitivity around the legacy of @entity36 , who was expected to be queen herself			1
with this in mind , royal aides announced that @entity12 would not use the title of @entity84 when @entity9 becomes @entity85			1
instead she would be known as @entity86			0
that still stands , although the public of today looks less likely to oppose the title of @entity84 .			0
