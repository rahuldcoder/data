there is a controversy brewing about @entity3 and its new " @entity4 " campaign			1
the ubiquitous coffee shop company was mocked for its decision to have its employees write the words " race together " on its coffee cups and start a discussion on race			2
but what 's so bad about that ? should n't we commend @entity3 for trying to be good corporate citizen , to walk the talk , as it were ? @entity3 ceo @entity19 announced the company 's new campaign this week , which he described as " an opportunity to begin to re-examine how we can create a more empathetic and inclusive society			1
" in other words , grab a cup of coffee and let 's talk about race			1
" we have problems in this country with regard to race and racial inequality , " @entity29 said in a video to corporate employees			2
" we believe we 're better than this , and we believe the country is better than this			0
there is a need for compassion , empathy and love towards others			0
" and he has indicated that the new move is not mandatory for its employees			0
this is what @entity29 calls " conscious capitalism			0
" it is an example of businesses who want to serve the community , get ahead of the curve rather than pander to what they think customers want , and show that they care about something other than getting paid			2
@entity60 : @entity61 is further proof that prosperity gospel is full of ' false profits ' of course , we would be foolish to think that @entity3 or any company would engage in such a strategy separate and apart from a profit motive			1
after all , the company , like any other money making enterprise , wants to make more money			0
and capitalism is all about making money			0
and yet , there are different pathways to getting there , and maybe @entity3 is showing us a new way			1
perhaps you think that their approach is corny , and yes , the company has faced a lot of attacks online for their stance			0
but the attacks are distracting us from a very important problem , one which many people would rather not discuss , with or without their coffee			2
clearly some people do want to talk about race , and there is a desperate need to confront the issue head on			1
what we are witnessing as a society is a new movement led by black women and spurred by the killing of black people such as @entity100 and @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 , and many more , whether by police or by armed vigilantes			0
@entity60 : blacks are treated 72 percent as well as whites people of all colors and persuasions have participated in # @entity113 , # @entity114 and # @entity116 protests and die - ins across the nation			0
race is part of the town hall , the public square			2
it always has been , but what is different now is that the issue is once again being placed on the front burner			2
it only makes sense that actors and players in society , including corporations such as @entity3 , would want to become part of that new dynamic			1
at a time when so many corporations are coming under fire for their questionable , exploitative , even deadly business practices , @entity3 is trying to be a responsible corporate citizen and part of the solution			1
@entity142 makes a great deal of money , and just as some corporations have benefited historically from slave labor and exploitation , some corporations today attempt to get ahead by cutting corners , underpaying their workers with poverty wages , cheating their customers with bad mortgages or polluting the environment			0
meanwhile , other companies take a completely different approach and realize that by giving back to the community , supporting worthwhile causes , and initiating important discussions not only helps their bottom line , but improves society 's bottom line			0
of course , we can not pretend that having a talk about race over coffee will solve @entity169 's problems , just as president @entity173 's " beer summit " over the racial profiling of @entity176 professor @entity175 fell short of fully capitalizing on one of those " teachable moments			1
" @entity60 : let 's stop the ' struggle equation ' race in the @entity169 is not merely about who likes or who does n't like you , or who calls you the n - word or does not want to live next to you			1
racism is a system of power dynamics and institutions that must be made to change			0
but these institutions are made of people , and people do have to talk			0
and who knows what can happen when people start to talk about race ? maybe they will even think about things in a different way			1
so , let 's not attack @entity3 for doing the right thing and getting the ball rolling on race			1
the only thing worthy of criticism is that other companies have n't done it , and that 's something that needs to change			0
more : what @entity3 ' # @entity210 campaign missed			1

@entity3 encouraged *baristas* to discuss race with customers
@entity216 : @entity3 *deserves* credit for *tackling* race , an issue that @entity169 need to talk about
