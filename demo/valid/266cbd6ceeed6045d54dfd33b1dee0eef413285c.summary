mention the words " sand " and " golf " together , and the chances are you 'll leave many players shuddering at the memory of being trapped in bunkers after another wayward shot			1
but in other parts of the world , sand golf is a version of the game in its own right			1
the idea of playing a round without verdant fairways to stride down or lush greens to putt ( and , of course , miss ) on seems strange , even wrong			2
sometimes needs must , though			0
half a century ago , expat oil workers with an enthusiasm for golf had nowhere in @entity25 to play			1
in the baking desert heat , with little or no irrigation possible , the equation was simple : they either had to adapt to the surroundings or there 'd be no golf at all			2
the result was an incarnation of the game in which the only grass to be seen is artificial , found on a mat carried around by players to serve both as a tee and a surface from which to strike when the ball is on the fairway			0
fairways ? they consist entirely of sand and are indicated by marker posts			0
if the ball lands outside them , it 's in the sand golf equivalent of the rough -- stony terrain that the unwary player may soon find is home to a few snakes and a lizard or two			1
greens ? well , they 're known as " browns , " built from clay and topped with a mixture of sand and oil to provide a true putting surface , a formula arrived at through trial and error			1
it 's an odd environment , this golfing world with a palette of golden - brown colors			0
and with rapidly developing irrigation and growing techniques enabling grass courses to be built in desert climes , it 's an increasingly unusual one			2
back in 1961 , determined @entity78 oil workers created a sand course on an atoll known as @entity81 , around 100 miles off @entity25 in the @entity82			1
it was the country 's first - ever golf club			0
as the expat population grew , so did the demand for the game , and in 1971 sand golf moved into @entity25 proper with the opening of a course near the @entity91			1
its success brought a move to the @entity95 , attracting close to 500 members			0
in the 1990s , the sand game 's fortunes took a dive as the site was earmarked for a nine - hole grass course			2
but although many sand course players changed surface and took up the more conventional game , several battled on and the 18 - hole @entity106 sand course was created near @entity25 airport , with its front nine occupying part of an archaeological site , in 1997			1
sand golf also exists in parts @entity111 and @entity113 but @entity114 ( which translates as " gazelle " -- gazelles peer from behind a fence by the second brown , ) is the only one that can be described as " world class , " says @entity122 , an expert on the game , because the scale and scope of its layout rivals its grass counterparts			1
the course found a place in the international spotlight when a @entity132 , boasting star names including @entity134 was played in 2004 and 2005 ( won by @entity135 and @entity136 , ) but the tournament fizzled out as showpiece events went to showpiece grass courses			0
maybe that 's understandable when you consider some of the extra elements involved in the sand game -- the browns , for example , must be swept for a few minutes after use so that they are left smooth and footprint-less for following players , while unexpected hazards can include burrows dug by desert lizards			1
@entity122 warns that a tradition is under threat , with a form of golf that was once commonplace in danger of becoming just a memory			2
other , smaller clubs have fallen by the wayside , while @entity114 's location near an expanding airport presents an obvious threat to its future			0
but even if the sand game were to fade into obscurity in the emirate , it is still played in parts of @entity113			2
in @entity174 , still racked by instability following the ousting of @entity177 , courses -- the bulk of which can be found in the capital , @entity173 -- are of sand , with no grass versions existing			0
once smart and well - kept , they have now slumped into neglect , with few people to play on them or look after them			0
@entity185 , who formerly worked at the @entity187 embassy in the city , wrote on his @entity190 blog about the experience of playing sand golf in and near the city			1
recounting his experiences of @entity173 's tattered nine - hole @entity196 course , he wrote that it was one for diehards only , " golf fanatics that would come every weekend to play a round on this challenging course			0
" and he imagined that the skeleton of the clubhouse , on which work had long since stopped , might one day boast " marble , chandeliers and state - of - the - art locker rooms ... overlooking the deep blue @entity208 with the sun setting over the sea			0
" for now , and against the odds , fans of this form of the game will just have to make do with being kings of their very own sand castles .			1
