the murder earlier this month of 27 - year - old @entity2 at the hands of a mob that beat her to death , burned her body and tossed her into a river shocked @entity10 , a country in which unspeakable things often hit the headlines			1
the young woman from @entity14 was falsely accused of burning pages in the @entity16			2
what followed was the horror of mob rule , all captured on video while bystanders looked on			2
soon after the incident , the images of her brutal slaying went viral on social media , noted @entity10 's @entity27			1
and this time , the outrage led @entity29 to the streets , with assistance from @entity32 and other social media			1
these platforms have served both to disseminate the images of her savage beating and murder and as a means for convening those who are mobilizing and organizing to protest her killing			2
last week , crowds chanted for days , calling for justice for @entity2 and " death for her killers			0
" and , @entity27 reported , protests were held in different parts of the country , calling for the " ultimate penalty to the perpetrators			0
" indeed , technology and connectedness have played a role in changing the old narratives in @entity10 , as @entity2 's killing shows			1
not only was her murder captured and shared online , but some of those men arrested for her killing were found to have confessed via social media posts			1
and now a country 's anguish is shared in those same online and virtual neighborhoods			0
some @entity29 civil society leaders see the protests that have resulted as yet another sign of an evolving @entity10 -- a nation whose recently elected leaders , now sharing a unity government , visited @entity71 , in an effort to turn the page on the past			1
" when we are talking about this case , what is it showing us ? first of all , when we are talking about women 's rights , we see that we have succeeded ; people will not tolerate what they tolerated a decade ago , " said @entity78 , founder and executive director of @entity80 , a non-governmental organization created to promote " a culture of peace , tolerance , transparency and accountability			0
" she was speaking last tuesday at a roundtable at @entity91 's @entity90 , organized around the visit by @entity29 president @entity93 and chief executive @entity94			1
" if this was the @entity10 of a decade before and this would have happened , a small group of @entity29 women would have come to the streets to be seeking justice			1
today we have men seeking justice			0
" @entity78 explained that the younger generation , a progressive generation , wants to have a peaceful @entity10			2
" but at the same time , we have conservatives who have been power - holders for many decades in @entity10 and they do n't want to see that			1
change always has a cost and unfortunately in this case we see that a very innocent girl like @entity2 has paid that			0
" @entity78 and other leaders from @entity10 could be seen checking @entity32 frequently for updates on what was happening on the streets of their capital			2
what they found was an online community sustaining the strong sense of injustice over @entity2 's killing that prompted the @entity29 president to announce , even before he left for the @entity125 , a fact - finding commission to investigate her murder			1
yet some @entity29 leaders worried that the brutality of this murder marked another troubling turning point in a country wrestling with a great many transitions -- economic , security and political -- all at once			1
" it never ( before ) happened to women at this level ; this was really one of the shocking acts of violence publicly within the capital , " said @entity135 , head of the @entity29 @entity136 , at the @entity91 panel			2
" it is not far from the palace , less than one kilometer			0
" " my personal concern is that if we do not manage the case properly , it might be used against us and against women 's rights in the country , " @entity135 added			0
women have gained a great deal in the roughly 13 years since the @entity155 was ousted from power			1
today , 3 million girls attend school			0
women serve in the country 's security forces -- albeit in very small numbers			0
they sit in @entity163 and work as entrepreneurs , teachers and civil society advocates			0
still , violence against women remains rampant and widespread			0
the practice of child marriage is outlawed but still common in some parts of the country			0
and security and the economy are still major challenges , particularly in the more remote provinces of the country untouched by the modernization gripping the nation 's more urban centers			2
indeed , @entity135 and other human rights advocates and civil society leaders who have played a role in @entity10 say they are determined that @entity2 's death will not be in vain			1
they say they will continue to fight to keep her case in the spotlight and to see justice served			0
their commitment to seeking public justice for a public horror may well be one of the most powerful signals yet of an @entity10 that is indeed a very different nation than it was only a decade ago .			1

murder of 27 - year - old woman by mob in @entity10 set social media ablaze with calls for justice
@entity206 : outrage , @entity29 president 's call for probe signal a changing nation years after @entity155 rule
