on the 6th of april 1996 , @entity0 and @entity1 strode out in front of 31,683 expectant fans at the @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7			1
the historic occasion was the first ever @entity10 match -- a brave new dawn for the world 's favorite sport in a land its charms had yet to conquer			1
summarizing the action for @entity18 , commentator @entity16 eagerly described the momentous " birth of a new era for @entity22 soccer			1
" looking back at footage from that balmy evening now it 's hard not to feel a certain nostalgia			2
baggy shirts , questionable hairstyles and strange rule adaptations to make games more exciting were all part of the formative @entity10 experience			1
countdown clocks were employed to provide drama at the end of each half			2
even more bizarrely , tied games were settled by shootouts that saw attacking players run with the ball from 35 - yards out before attempting to beat the opposing goalkeeper			2
as the @entity10 prepares to mark the beginning of its 20th season , it 's hard to comprehend just how much the league has progressed in the intervening period			1
long gone is the desire to tamper with the rules of the game for a start			1
attendances are higher than ever before while the number of teams involved has doubled from 10 in the 1996 campaign to 20 in 2015			1
a further four are set to be added by 2020			2
on top of this , the new season is the first of a new domestic tv and media rights deal with @entity61 , @entity18 and @entity62 worth $ 700 million over eight years			1
this figure may pale beside the $ 5.1 billion recently paid by @entity64 broadcasters for the @entity65 , the richest football league in the world , but it represents a tripling in value of the previous @entity10 deal			1
according to @entity71 , co-primary owner and president of the new @entity10 franchise , @entity73 , " the industry and the game itself has moved on dramatically " in the @entity22			1
he believes what would equal 50 years growth in most other industries has been experienced in the first two decades of the @entity10			1
@entity80 ' club is a prime example of this rapid transformation			2
he describes players being pushed out of changing facilities because of a schedule clash with a yoga class not so long ago			2
this weekend 60,000 fans are expected to witness @entity73 's opening weekend fixture against @entity89 , another new club making their mls bow			1
@entity92 winners @entity93 and @entity94 will turn out for @entity73 and @entity89 respectively			2
" we 're just on the crest of the wave at the moment , " @entity71 said of football 's @entity22 progress			2
" can it be the number two , number three sport in this country ? yes , i think it can			2
and it can be in a short space of time			2
" these positive assertions are backed by the huge interest @entity22 fans showed in last year 's @entity92 in @entity112			2
@entity114 's group stage clash with @entity115 attracted 25 million viewers , according to figures from tv ratings firm , @entity118			2
that 's considerably more than the 15 million baseball 's @entity120 averaged on @entity61 or the similar audience that tuned into the 2014 @entity124 finals on @entity125			0
anyone who saw 20,000 pumped - up young fans pack out @entity129 's @entity128 to cheer on their country via big screens , meanwhile , would find it hard to argue against soccer in the @entity22 now being anything other than a big deal			0
reaching this promising stage , however , has been anything but a smooth ride			0
the @entity10 was reported to have lost as much as $ 250 million in its first five years while average attendances initially dwindled after the inaugural season			1
three teams -- @entity142 , @entity143 ( both in 2001 ) and @entity144 ( 2014 ) -- were disbanded along the way due to a mixture of lack of fan interest and ownership troubles			0
a report by @entity151 at the end of 2013 , meanwhile , claimed that only 10 out of 19 @entity10 teams were profitable			1
and as recently as this week , @entity10 players looked like they could be going on strike over wages and the right of players to become free agents when their contracts end			1
then there 's the way the league develops , attracts and trades players			0
a salary cap restricts the amount teams can spend on playing squads			1
each side , however , has a number of spaces that can be allocated to " off budget " signings which are not included within the cap			0
this includes promising @entity176 players who enter the @entity10 through the draft systems before completing their college education			1
homegrown players from club 's development academies are also exempt as are a maximum of three designated players ( @entity184 ) , usually stellar international names whose wages and transfer fees will be covered by club owners or sponsors			0
one of the main criticisms of the @entity10 and its complex player acquisition rulebook is that while it does entice prominent stars of the game like @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196 to appear in the @entity10 , it only does so when their careers are on a downward trajectory			1
why would an exceptional player want to move to a league that can only attract a handful of top talents at any one time , after all ? and herein lies one of the leagues biggest challenges in attracting and keeping the talented players fans want to see			0
although the likes of the salary cap encourages fiscal probity , it means @entity10 teams are restricted by rules clubs in other markets are not			1
head coach of @entity215 , @entity216 , highlighted these difficulties in comments carried by the @entity220 newspaper last year			0
" we 're in a place where at times you ca n't compete with foreign clubs because of the kind of dynamics they have in regards to finances			0
we have a salary cap			1
they do n't , " @entity216 said			0
according to @entity232 , a football agent who has worked to bring in and sell players from the league in recent years , current philosophies with regards player - trading may be have to be tweaked to help the @entity10 grow yet further			1
he describes the importance of placing an emphasis on attracting younger players with @entity241 passports			0
such talented individuals will have a sell - on value that can be recouped by the league and their clubs if they move on from the @entity10 to the biggest and wealthiest leagues across the @entity247			1
theoretically , at least , this money can then be reinvested in the league , player development and attracting yet more promising players to the @entity10			1
this in turn will raise the standard further			0
an early example of this strategy can perhaps be found in the transfer of @entity258 , a @entity259 midfielder who moved from @entity215 to @entity260 last year in a deal brokered by @entity232			0
@entity258 arrived on a free transfer aged 20 after being released by @entity263 in 2012			0
he excelled at @entity264 , winning the @entity265 before being sold to the @entity267 giants at a profit in june 2014			0
@entity232 is quick to make clear such plans would need good scouting systems to truly flourish			0
it could also be achieved by signing @entity272 closer to the peak stage of their career , he added			0
this last point is something that appears be happening already			0
" before they used to have a lot of big names who could no longer run in @entity281 , " @entity232 said			0
" ( but ) @entity285 is not an old guy , ( @entity288 ) @entity287 is still going strong " and both could still offer something to teams in @entity281 , he said by way of example of @entity89 's first @entity184 signings			0
nevertheless , he continued , the signing of more young players with big potential " is probably something we 'll see more of			0
" whether @entity232 is correct will become apparent in the months and years ahead			0
either way , that brave new @entity10 dawn that broke over @entity6 back in 1996 has turned into a bright morning			1
@entity2 's @entity299 contributed to this story .			0

the 20th @entity10 season begins this weekend
@entity65 has changed dramatically since its *inception* in 1996
some question whether rules regarding salary caps and transfers need to change
