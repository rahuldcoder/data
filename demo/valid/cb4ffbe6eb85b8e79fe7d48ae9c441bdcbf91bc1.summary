asked whether he would accept the government contribution available to lawmakers and congressional staffers for their health care coverage through the @entity2 , @entity0 said he will " follow the text of the law			1
" " i strongly oppose the exemption that president @entity23 illegally put in place for members of @entity26 because ( @entity29 ) @entity27 and the @entity28 did n't want to be under the same rules as the @entity32 people , " @entity0 said , before repeating : " i believe we should follow the text of the law			1
