" a pilot called me last week , concerned he might have @entity4 , " a health care provider told me recently at a meeting			2
" but if i find he has the disease , do i have to report him to the @entity9 ? and if so , should i call him first and tell him that ? would he lose his job ? " she was totally unsure what to do			1
several other providers were present , and none of them knew , either			2
" you should definitely call him and tell him , " a health care lawyer , who was present , said			2
" you have to provide full disclosure			2
" " but presumably , he knows that you might do so , " i said			2
" and if you told him , he might not come in for the check - up			0
" marfan syndrome affects connective tissue and can lead to sudden tears in the aortic artery , causing sudden death			0
yet if treated , it poses much less risk , though not necessarily zero			0
the case raised several specific quandaries about what the responsibilities of medical professionals are and should be -- legally or ethically -- in evaluating pilots			1
the @entity9 requires that pilots self - report any diagnoses			1
but health care professionals have no obligation to notify anyone			0
they may know that a pilot has a medical problem that is poorly or not treated and may endanger passengers , but these providers have no obligation to do anything about it			1
these issues are crucial , given that @entity51 deliberately crashed the @entity52 , killing 150 passengers			0
we still do n't know why he committed suicide - murder , but the latest reports indicate he was treated for suicidal tendencies before getting his pilot license			0
the @entity61 disaster has demonstrated that current standards of medical and psychiatric evaluation are inadequate			1
the @entity9 requires only that pilots fill out a psychological questionnaire , asking whether they have had psychological symptoms			1
but pilots are not assessed in person by a psychiatrist			1
such face - to - face assessments can provide crucial information that self - report forms might miss , partly because pilots might answer inaccurately			1
moreover , the @entity9 requires only that 25 % of pilots have a single random drug screen per year			1
pilots may pass drug tests in january and realize that the odds of undergoing subsequent tests that year are nil			1
they may hence use more alcohol and recreational drugs			0
we need to consider changing current policies			0
some alterations are relatively easy			0
the @entity9 should consider requiring far more drug testing -- for all pilots , perhaps every few days			1
other possible reforms pose difficult ethical dilemmas , and thus need broad , careful discussion -- e.g. , what role providers should play and how much privacy pilots should have			1
medical exams and records over time can indicate key problems that a single visit to an @entity9 doctor may miss. but requiring more information from pilots diminishes their rights to privacy			1
indeed , such rights impeded investigators from knowing initially the reason @entity51 took a six - month leave and the nature of his medical condition			2
physicians have to break patient confidentiality when third parties may be endangered			2
the legal precedent for breaking patient confidentiality in this way is the so - called @entity117 case , in which a young patient told his psychologist at the @entity120 that he wanted to kill his girlfriend , @entity122			0
the psychologist alerted the campus police , though not the city police or @entity117			0
unfortunately , the patient then killed @entity117			0
a court found the psychologist liable			0
these violations of patient confidentiality make us providers uncomfortable			2
as a physician , i have had to report patients whom i even suspected might be abusing a child			0
i remember one patient who came to the emergency room for psychiatric problems mentioning that she sometimes hit her toddler son with the end of an electrical cord , swinging it until the thick part banged him			2
as i asked more , she began to cry			0
i felt terrible for her and was unsure how dangerous her actions were , but i erred on the side of protecting the child 's safety and contacted social services			0
when i told her , she nodded , then whispered thank you			0
she knew she needed help			0
still , in @entity155 and several states , providers do not have to break patient confidentiality , even when they think the patient may endanger others			0
critical dilemmas arise , though , of what threshold should be used concerning which diagnoses and how much their successful treatment should matter			1
some diagnoses may be treatable and thus permissible if doctors examine the pilot more frequently than once a year			2
early in the @entity170 epidemic , for instance , some critics argued that @entity170 - infected pilots should be barred from flying , since the virus could cause neurological problems			1
fortunately , the @entity9 decided that evidence of actual neurological deficits -- not infection alone -- should ground these employees			1
physicians arguably should consider reporting pilots who have , for instance , epilepsy , manic - depression or diabetes that leads to coma if these conditions are not well controlled with medications			1
yet stigma can make pilots fear job loss and thus hide diagnoses and not seek treatment			1
the @entity9 could require that pilots seek treatment in order to fly , but some pilots may still simply cover up problems			1
ideally , the clinician should be able to talk with the pilot about the need not to fly and arrange a leave for a few months to improve treatment			1
good employee assistance programs and trust are also needed			0
in addition , we need research to find how much physician reporting would reduce risks or lead pilots to camouflage problems			1
questions still arise of whether even the suspicion of a problem that could impede function should warrant reporting			2
an individual may seem fine weeks or even days before becoming seriously depressed			0
careful , transparent discussion , involving medical experts , pilots , policymakers and others , to establish policies with clearly established cutoffs are thus vital			1
unfortunately , suicides , for instance , are impossible to predict			0
but much can be done to improve the current system .			0

@entity224 : physicians should consider reporting pilots who have medical problems such as depression
yet stigma can make pilots fear job loss and thus hide diagnoses and not seek treatment
the @entity9 could require that pilots seek treatment in order to fly , but some pilots may still simply cover up problems
