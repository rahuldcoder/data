prince @entity0 arrived in @entity2 on sunday -- the first visit to @entity4 by a senior member of the @entity6 in three decades -- and he might have been expecting a dose of culture shock			1
but chances are he 'll feel right at home			0
from television shows and etiquette lessons to private schools and mock @entity16 housing developments , @entity4 has been embracing @entity18 culture with a passion			1
@entity4 viewers are captivated in their millions by shows like " @entity22 " and " @entity23 , " with the former 's star , @entity26 , so popular he has his own @entity4 nickname -- @entity28			1
the fascination with @entity30 depicted in @entity23 has created a growing demand for butlers , and the country 's elite are donning tweeds and taking up deer stalking			0
" @entity23 depicts traditional @entity18 , high - class lives			2
it something that i and many other @entity4 are curious about , " said student @entity38			0
it 's not just television shows			0
affluent @entity4 parents are sending their children to @entity18 schools after some of the most notable names in @entity18 education have established campuses in @entity4			2
@entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 have all opened sister schools in the country			0
and the obsession with @entity18 culture has taken a bizarre turn in @entity59 , a housing development on the outskirts of @entity62 that resembles a quaint @entity64 town , complete with replica red telephone booths			1
it 's crucial that prince @entity0 capitalizes on these cultural ties during his high - profile visit , which is being viewed as the first real test of his diplomatic skills			1
" it will tell us something about how he will handle one of the most important diplomatic relationships when he comes to throne , " said @entity71 , a professor of @entity4 politics at the @entity73 and a former @entity18 diplomat			1
" and i think @entity4 will put some capital in his visit because this guy is not a politician , who come and go , but ( someone who ) will be around for quite a while			0
" cultural exports are viewed as a growth area that the prince can promote			0
@entity4 spent 17 million pounds on @entity18 tv programs and formats in 2013 , a 40 % increase on the year before , but they form a small part of the overall trade balance			1
and while @entity99 has been successful in attracting @entity4 investment , @entity18 companies have not thrived in @entity4 the same way as some of their @entity104 and @entity105 counterparts			2
previous trips by @entity108 have been gaffe ridden			0
when the @entity110 and prince @entity111 spent time in @entity4 in 1986 , the @entity110 's husband caused offense when he told a group of @entity18 students : " if you stay here much longer , you 'll all be slitty - eyed			1
" prince @entity117 , @entity0 's father , has never visited @entity4 but described the country 's leaders as " appalling old waxworks " during his visit to @entity122 in 1997			1
his close ties with the @entity124 , @entity125 's spiritual leader , have also angered @entity4 's leaders			0
prince @entity0 will visit @entity2 's @entity127 , attend the @entity4 premiere of the @entity18 - produced children 's animated movie " @entity131 " in @entity62 and launch a campaign to celebrate @entity18 innovation during the three - day trip			1
before @entity4 , he is spending three days in @entity135			2
the prince will also get a chance to champion one of his favorite causes -- combating the illegal trade in wildlife -- when he visits an elephant sanctuary in southwestern @entity4 " if he can make some kind of link in @entity4 , if he can instinctively show he gets it , that could be an important thing , " @entity71 said			2
but the relationship between the @entity18 and @entity4 comes laden with " stacks of historic baggage , " @entity71 adds , and the prince will have to tread carefully , particularly over the former colony of @entity122 , where the push for a free vote has strained ties between @entity18 and @entity4 , the current landlords			1
@entity18 lawmakers were denied permission to visit the city on a " fact - finding " mission last year amid heated pro-democracy protests			0
what 's more , it 's not clear how much " star power " prince @entity0 has in @entity4 , especially without his glamorous wife @entity162 , who at eight months pregnant wo n't make the trip , and his young son @entity164			1
an informal survey conducted by the @entity18 's @entity168 newspaper in @entity2 showed that many struggled to recognize the @entity170 and @entity162 -- one thought the couple were in the movie " @entity173 " -- and there are fears his visit will struggle to attract interest among ordinary @entity4			2
" @entity177 are not really a big deal to me , " said @entity38 , the @entity23 fan			0
@entity179 in @entity2 contributed to this report			0
