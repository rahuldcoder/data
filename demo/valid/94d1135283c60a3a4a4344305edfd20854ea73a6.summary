@entity2 @entity1 's transport safety chief has always described himself as a pessimist			1
but @entity5 , chief commissioner of the @entity6 , says that as search teams scour the depths of the @entity9 for any sign of @entity11 , he is confident they will find the plane , if the aircraft is in the areas where they are looking			1
" if anything , i 'm slightly more optimistic than six months ago , because we have more confidence in the data , and we have proven the search equipment and techniques work to the necessary standards , " @entity5 said			1
but as the first anniversary of @entity11 's disappearance approaches , with no trace of the missing plane found , not everyone shares his outlook			1
that includes many of the relatives of the 239 passengers and crew on board , who say not a single day goes by without wondering what happened to their loved ones			1
and for many , the decision in late january by @entity37 to officially declare @entity11 an accident , enabling the insurance payout process to begin in accordance with international protocol , was painfully premature			1
" how can they say that , when there is no proof that the plane has crashed ? " asked @entity42 , whose son @entity43 was one of 153 @entity45 nationals on board			1
" we have to get the facts , " @entity43 said			0
what families have been told , they say , simply is n't good enough			1
anger , frustration , and distrust pushed some relatives , including @entity43 , to fly from @entity45 to @entity57 last month , to demand more			0
but when families submitted a letter to @entity63 asking for authorities to explain the declaration and status of the investigation , a written response from the company 's ceo revealed little that had n't already been said			1
at 12:41 a.m. local time on march 8 , 2014 , @entity11 took off from @entity68 , en route to @entity70			1
less than an hour later , the @entity71 was flying over the @entity72			0
air traffic controllers in @entity37 radioed the crew to contact controllers in @entity76 for its onward journey through @entity79 airspace			0
the crew acknowledged the request , thanking @entity57 controllers with a routine reply : " good night , @entity37 @entity84			0
" minutes later , the plane disappeared from radar			0
@entity37 authorities revealed days later that military radar had tracked the plane as it turned back to the west , flew across the @entity90 , and up the @entity91 , before flying out of radar range and vanishing once again			0
the search area widened , then shifted off the coast of @entity1 , when it was determined through careful analysis of a series of messages or " handshakes " between the plane and an @entity101 telecommunications satellite , that @entity11 eventually turned south , and flew for hours into the @entity9			1
roughly a week 's sail from the coast of @entity1 , ships with specialists and equipment capable of searching depths that regularly exceed 4,000 meters ( 13,123 feet ) , work around the clock , methodically ticking off sections of sea floor			1
in early february a new ship , the @entity112 , joined the search carrying the @entity114 , a programmable unmanned submarine , now scanning areas that other equipment could n't safely cover , including steep mountain slopes			1
the ship joins the @entity120 and @entity119 , both operated by a @entity123 survey firm , along with the @entity37 - contracted @entity124			0
" i asked specifically to come on this job , because it 's a very exciting opportunity to do something that will potentially help a lot of people , " @entity125 , a surveyor who usually works in the oil industry in the @entity127 , told @entity3 's @entity128 , as he prepared to embark on a trip on the @entity130 that could last up to six weeks			1
since october , more than 24,000 square kilometers -- roughly 40 % of what the @entity6 calls the " priority search area " -- has been scanned , with the remainder of the work scheduled to be finished by may before weather conditions worsen as the southern winter approaches			2
for now , teams are searching mostly using devices called towfish , which are dragged close to the ocean floor on cables up to 10 kilometers long			0
it 's tough work , even when conditions are perfect			2
a number of cyclones , producing waves of up to 16 meters , put the brakes on the search in early february			2
@entity5 is careful to point out search efforts are meeting or exceeding expectations , dismissing concerns over stormy weather or delays in installing equipment as " part of the deal			1
" the current search area is the result of months of analysis and reexamination of satellite data by an international team of experts , combined with aircraft performance factors such as fuel range , speed , and altitude			2
search ships are focused along the so - called 7th arc , or " partial handshake , " where international investigators believe the plane ran out of fuel			2
" the thing that really impresses me most about this investigation was how much information we were able to gain through mathematics and science , " said @entity3 safety analyst @entity181			2
but @entity181 , a former @entity188 accident investigator , is not optimistic that the deep - sea search teams will find what they 're looking for			2
" i know that they 've searched in the most probable areas where it would have been , and it 's not there , " he said			2
@entity195 , a science journalist and author of " the plane that was n't there , " took that skepticism a step further , saying it 's time to reexamine all the clues			2
his latest theory contends that investigators may have misinterpreted a key component of the @entity101 satellite data , and that @entity11 may have instead flown north toward @entity207			1
" this is not a normal investigation			0
they need to throw out the book , " said @entity195			0
" this is unlike anything that 's happened in aviation			2
" but @entity215 , an engineer with decades of experience in the mobile satellite communications industry , says the data " accurately and unambiguously " shows @entity11 went down near the 7th arc			1
" the current @entity6 search strategy remains the best search strategy , " @entity215 said			2
" they are looking exactly where i expect the plane to be found			2
" the @entity6 's @entity5 cautioned that search teams have placed equal priority on all areas within the 60,000 square kilometer search zone			1
" we have n't given up			0
quite the opposite , " he said			0
if search teams succeed in locating the wreckage of @entity11 , @entity1 , which has been leading the search at @entity37 's request , will also lead salvage and recovery efforts , according to the @entity6 chief commissioner			1
but @entity37 , @entity1 , and @entity45 , which had the majority of the passengers on board the flight , have not yet made a decision on whether a recovery will occur , @entity5 said			1
it is unclear what will happen if search teams complete their current mission without finding any sign of the plane			0
@entity1 has allocated roughly $ 48 million to the current phase of the search , with @entity37 promising to contribute equally to the cost			0
in january , the @entity37 government said it is committed " to continue all reasonable efforts to bring closure to this unfortunate tragedy			0
" one possibility is that the deep - sea search could be extended outside the boundaries of the current priority area , north or south along the 7th arc			0
the @entity6 would not comment on the likelihood of expanding the search , saying that it was a " decision for governments			0
" @entity37 also plans to release an interim statement detailing the progress of the investigation into @entity11 around march 8 -- though some experts believe it will not contain any information investigators do not already have			1
aviation experts say there is a key reason the search should continue until @entity11 is found			1
" without knowing what caused it , you ca n't fix it , you ca n't make sure it does n't happen again , " said @entity181			0
" and i think that 's really the biggest tragedy of this , if they do n't find the airplane			0
" for the families of the 239 passengers and crew on board , who have had nothing but hope and prayers to carry them through the past year , it 's about finding answers			1
" it 's very difficult to hear the world closure , when there is no closure , " @entity294 , the wife of lead steward @entity295 , told @entity3 's @entity296			0
and while @entity294 says she holds out hope her husband could return home alive , she is prepared for a difficult discovery			0
" if it 's there and there 's debris , we can have closure and we can lay him at peace			0
because i do n't think he 's at peace right now			0
" the search for @entity11 continues			1
@entity3 's @entity296 , @entity128 , @entity314 , @entity315 , @entity316 , and @entity317 contributed to this report .			0

ahead of one year anniversary , search chief says he 's confident @entity11 will eventually be found
not all share @entity5 's optimism
families angry at the lack of information concerning their loved ones lost on board
