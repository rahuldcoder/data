whoever wins the general election on may 7 will face international challenges reaching to the heart of a question that has bedevilled every @entity7 government since 1945 : what is , or should be , @entity10 's role in the world ? as one of @entity14 's victor countries , @entity10 helped shape the post-war international architecture			1
notably , it gained a permanent seat , plus veto power , in the @entity19 , which it retains to this day			0
but these battlefield laurels disguised fundamental weakness			0
the two world wars severely depleted @entity10 's human and material resources			1
the heyday of the world 's largest - ever empire and of @entity7 and @entity29 's control of a vast maritime trading network had passed			1
as the @entity32 took global grip , the @entity31 purposefully pushed @entity10 aside			1
the @entity31 took over its military bases , its spheres of influence , and its markets			1
conscious of its decline , @entity7 clung , slightly pathetically , to what it termed its " special relationship " with @entity42			2
maintaining this key @entity31 relationship is the most important foreign policy challenge facing @entity10 's prime minister after may 7			1
whether that person is the @entity48 's @entity47 or the opposition @entity50 's @entity49 makes no difference			2
@entity53 's arrival in the @entity54 now looks like a watershed for bilateral relations			2
unlike many of his post-war predecessors , @entity53 was no @entity59			0
indeed , his grandfather 's unhappy experience in colonial - era @entity62 gave him reason to dislike the @entity65			2
@entity53 the dispassionate analyst also found scant objective reason to prioritize the @entity10 alliance or @entity69 generally			2
looking at the @entity70 , he saw one dominant , friendly power -- and its capital was @entity73 , not @entity7			0
looking the other way , to @entity75 , @entity53 saw opportunities and threats of far greater moment , centered on rising powers such as @entity80 and @entity81 -- hence his subsequent " tilt " to @entity75			0
@entity10 's principal value to the @entity31 lies with its defense capabilities			1
it proved a loyal if not especially effective ally in @entity87 and @entity88			0
although capacity has steadily declined in the past 30 years , @entity10 was seventh in the world in 2013 in terms of military spending and remains a dependable @entity31 deputy within @entity94			1
but the pre-election consensus is that the next @entity10 government will be obliged to slash defense spending again , probably below the 2 % of gdp threshold to which @entity94 members are pledged to maintain			2
big cuts in army and air force numbers are in prospect			0
maintaining even one modern aircraft carrier has become a real struggle			2
it is likely , on these trends , that @entity10 would be unable to contribute separately to any new international campaign , but would be obliged to place its troops under @entity31 command , as general @entity112 , @entity31 army chief of staff , recently suggested			1
@entity31 's top politicians , soldiers and diplomats , such as @entity19 ambassador @entity115 , are applying increasing pressure on @entity10 over defense expenditure , but with little joy so far			1
in time , this impasse could lead to a permanent rift			0
worse still , in the @entity31 view , is the possibility that a @entity50 - led government , potentially beholden to the unilateral nuclear disarmers of the @entity125 , could slacken its commitment to @entity127 , the @entity10 's nuclear missile submarine fleet			1
the @entity125 says the country can no longer afford a nuclear deterrent , morally or financially			0
@entity42 's worries about @entity10 's role have been exacerbated by the lack of fight , as some see it , displayed by @entity7 when faced with the prospect of @entity138 independence and the inevitable break - up of the @entity10			1
similar concerns apply to @entity10 's @entity70 membership , which @entity47 has placed in doubt by promising a national referendum by 2017			1
the @entity31 greatly values @entity10 as an informal , surrogate voice within the @entity70			1
but @entity42 's interests aside , the @entity70 is @entity10 's biggest trading partner and a natural ally in terms of democratic values , and legal , social and cultural norms			1
an exit from the @entity70 would satisfy minority hardline nationalists in the @entity10 @entity153			2
but it would seriously undermine @entity10 's standing in the world , in relation to @entity69 and to the emerging @entity159 powers			1
all this matters more than ever because , amid the developing disorder of the @entity156 , old certainties are being uprooted and new or revived threats are multiplying			0
the aggressive behavior of @entity165 is one obvious example			0
another is the rise of international terrorism , most recently in the form of @entity171 , also known as the @entity172			0
another is @entity80 's hegemonic ambitions in the @entity80 and @entity176 seas , at the expense of neighbors such as @entity179 , the @entity180 and @entity181			0
on these issues , it seems that @entity10 , by design or not , has little concrete to contribute			1
@entity7 allowed @entity186 and @entity187 to take the lead on @entity190 diplomacy			0
embarrassed by public criticism , @entity47 belatedly sent a few army advisers to help train @entity194 's forces			0
similarly , @entity7 's military contribution to the fight against @entity171 has been minimal , and confined to @entity88			0
members of @entity198 recently expressed strong dismay that @entity10 was doing so little			2
and as for @entity179 , ostensibly an important @entity10 ally , recent defense cooperation agreements do not disguise the likely infeasibility of sharp - end assistance			1
indeed , as some see it , there is far too much @entity10 kow - towing to @entity80			2
disturbed by this evidence of decline , @entity10 's political class comforts itself by arguing the country still leads by example			1
it still maintains a generous overseas aid budget , it mounts successful humanitarian missions such as in @entity215 during the @entity217 outbreak , it remains a top five world economic power , and sometimes ( though not always ) it uses its @entity19 and other platforms to stand up for democratic values and human rights			0
but it is small consolation for a country that , 100 years ago , was a superpower with truly global reach			0
in the election campaign , foreign policy and the key 21st century international issues , such as climate change , have barely got a mention so far			1
this is not an accident			0
@entity10 's horizons are narrowing			1
its strength and global ambitions are fading			0
its post-imperial destiny is that of a second - tier power			0
the trick is not to appear second rate .			0

whoever wins may 7 election must answer this question , says @entity247 : what is , or should be , @entity10 's role in the world ?
@entity247 : maintaining @entity31 relationship is most important foreign policy challenge facing @entity10 's *pm* after may 7
but foreign policy and key 21st century issues , such as climate change , have barely been mentioned , he writes
