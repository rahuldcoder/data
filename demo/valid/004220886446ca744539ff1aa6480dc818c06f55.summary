@entity0 @entity3 's highest court friday will consider whether to uphold the 2009 murder conviction of @entity6 @entity5 , according to judge @entity7			1
the high court judge will either uphold the murder convictions of @entity10 and her @entity3 ex-boyfriend , or send the case back for another appeal , or potentially on to a different section of the court			1
@entity10 , a 27 - year - old @entity18 native , and @entity19 were convicted of the 2007 killing of @entity10 's @entity22 roommate , @entity23			1
@entity10 and @entity24 lived together in @entity3 at the time of @entity24 's death			1
@entity19 and @entity10 were acquitted in 2011 on appeal , and then @entity10 returned to the @entity6			0
however , @entity3 's @entity28 overturned the acquittals in 2013 , and they were convicted last year after a retrial			1
if a new trial is ordered , @entity10 and @entity19 will buy a little time before a final decision is reached			0
but if the court upholds the conviction , the case will be closed for good -- and what happens to @entity10 next is uncertain			1
conventional wisdom dictates that @entity10 will eventually face an extradition hearing or reach a deal with the @entity40 to serve her 28 - year sentence , but that could take years			0
the statute of limitations is double the sentence , meaning the @entity3 have 57 years to bring her back to the country			1
@entity10 , however , would benefit from the @entity6 ' extradition treaty with @entity3 -- under which the @entity6 will not extradite a person who has been acquitted -- and from the @entity6 @entity52 's protection against double jeopardy			1
@entity19 , on the other hand , still lives in @entity3 , and has a lot more to lose than @entity10 does , at least in the short term			2
he would be scooped up immediately and hauled off to prison to start a 25 - year sentence			0
all of his options will have been exhausted and he will have no choice but to go to directly to jail			0
@entity19 earlier said he would be in court on wednesday to face the judge			2
" i 've been living this for eight years , " he told the @entity3 crime tv program " @entity65			2
" not appearing in court would be like hiding in the corner during a tsunami -- it will take you away anyway			2
" @entity23 , from the @entity71 , was convicted separately in a fast - track trial and is midway through a 16 - year sentence for @entity24 's murder			1
his case was confirmed by @entity3 's high court in 2010			1
many commentators in the @entity6 have reasoned that @entity3 may not ask the @entity6 for @entity10 's extradition because it would cause a diplomatic rift between the two nations			1
but there could be a greater rift if it appears that @entity10 gets away with murder and her @entity3 ex-boyfriend pays for the crime			1
if @entity19 is languishing in prison and @entity10 is sipping @entity90 in a @entity18 @entity91 , @entity3 will not be pleased , says @entity92 , an @entity3 journalist for @entity93 who has been covering the case since @entity24 was killed in 2007			1
" it will be seen as an injustice , " @entity92 told @entity1			0
" you may not see people out on the streets , but if you ask 10 people what they think , those 10 people will tell you they see it as a complete injustice that only the @entity3 and the @entity105 are in prison			2
the @entity3 will say that the @entity6 gets away with murder and it wo n't be the first time			1
" this is not the first time @entity3 and the @entity6 have butted heads on matters involving @entity6 suspects accused of crimes in @entity3			2
in 1998 , an @entity115 aircraft sliced through a ski lift cable in the @entity117 , sending 20 people plummeting to their death			0
even after admitting to destroying the videotape of the deadly flight , only two of the four @entity121 were charged and convicted			0
only one served jail time -- just over four months of a six - month sentence			0
in 2012 , @entity3 's highest court upheld the convictions of 23 @entity6 ( 22 @entity129 agents and an @entity131 pilot ) for the kidnapping of @entity134 cleric @entity133 , a suspeced terrorist , from a street in @entity136			1
they were sentenced to between five and eight years in prison , but @entity3 has not yet asked for extradition			2
" our relationship with the @entity6 is full of these diplomatic tensions , " said @entity92			0
" this will just be added to the list			0
" @entity10 's case has been divisive from the start , and her supporters have come down hard on the @entity3 judicial system			1
@entity19 has never had the luxury of that attitude , knowing full well that he is in the hands of the system whether he likes it or not , so vocally criticizing it would n't be in his best interest			0
in fact , he has long suffered the impact of @entity10 's ardent campaigners who have mostly criticized @entity3 from the other side of the @entity160			1
by almost any @entity3 precedent , @entity19 should not have had to be in prison during his initial trial -- but because @entity10 was deemed a flight risk , she had to stay in jail			2
because @entity19 was her co-defendant , he did too , even though he had no ties to anyone abroad			0
" @entity10 could still beat the system , but @entity19 's game is up if the convictions are upheld , " @entity169 , an @entity3 extradition lawyer familiar with both legal systems , told @entity1			1
" he has no wiggle room and it could be that he serves the time for both of them , which will likely cause deep resentment here in @entity3			2
" perhaps a little too late , @entity19 's defense team has been slowly inching away from @entity10 , especially since the latest conviction			0
last summer , he held a press conference when his lawyers filed their appeal to the high court , in which his lawyer @entity186 pointed out " certain anomalies " in @entity10 's testimony that have nothing to do with @entity19			1
" we ask that the court to not extend the anomalies of @entity5 's testimony to @entity19 , " @entity186 said at the time			2
whether that is enough to get the high court to give @entity19 another , independent chance is yet to be seen			1
" i am not a crazy person			0
i am not a criminal			0
i am innocent , " @entity19 told reporters last summer at the press conference			0
" but my name is @entity19 , not @entity5			0
" now it is up to the judge to determine whether that makes any difference			0
