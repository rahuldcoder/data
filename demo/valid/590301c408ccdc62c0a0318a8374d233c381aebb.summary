a 20 - year - old man from the @entity3 area has been arrested in connection with the shooting of two police officers during last week 's protests in @entity8 , @entity9 , a prosecutor said sunday			1
@entity12 was arrested late saturday , and he has been charged with two counts of first - degree assault , a count of firing a weapon from a vehicle and three counts of armed criminal activity , @entity3 prosecuting attorney @entity11 said at a news conference in @entity21			1
" the demonstrations were pretty much over ( when the officers were shot )			1
people were leaving , and that 's when this happened , " he said , describing @entity12 as a demonstrator who had taken part in protests on numerous occasions			1
at the time of his arrest , @entity12 was on probation for receiving stolen property , and @entity11 said he believed @entity12 had an outstanding warrant after not reporting to his probation officer for several months			1
the prosecutor repeatedly thanked the public for the information that led to the arrest			1
he also said that , because of the public 's assistance in the case , police were able to serve a search warrant on @entity12 ' residence where they seized a .40 - caliber handgun , " which has been tied to the shell casings that were recovered " at the scene of the shooting			1
@entity12 is being held on a cash - only $ 300,000 bond , @entity11 said , adding that it 's possible @entity12 could face more charges and that others could be charged in the case			1
one element of the case that authorities have yet to sort out is intent , @entity11 said , adding that @entity12 has acknowledged firing the shots but has said he was n't aiming at the police officers			1
investigators are not sure they " buy " @entity12 ' claim that he opened fire after a dispute with other individuals , @entity11 said , but he did n't rule it out			1
" it 's possible he was firing at someone else , " he said , urging any other witnesses with information to come forward			0
bishop @entity74 , an area organizer , challenged the idea that @entity12 was a well - known protester			1
" i asked him ( @entity12 ) why would he say that he was a protester because it makes us look bad -- because so many things that we 've done to rebuild our community			2
it sets us like five steps back to say that it was a protester who did it , but he admitted to me that he 'd never protested , " said @entity74 , who spoke to @entity12 on sunday			2
@entity74 added : " we wo n't allow this to distract us from our mission , and from purpose , because we will continue to fight			0
" the shootings occurred wednesday night			0
the shots rang out from a hill overlooking the city 's police station shortly after midnight wednesday , at the end of a protest against the @entity98 , @entity3 police chief @entity91 said at the time			1
officers saw " muzzle flashes ... about 125 yards away , " @entity91 said			0
" we could have buried two police officers , " @entity91 told reporters last week			2
" i feel very confident that whoever did this ... came there for whatever nefarious reason that it was			0
" public donations poured in to be used toward a reward to find the gunman and any accomplices , @entity91 said			0
authorities offered a $ 10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of person or persons responsible for the gunfire upon the two officers , according to the @entity120 website			2
@entity11 said the tipster whose information led to @entity12 ' arrest is eligible to receive the reward			2
he declined to provide any information on the tipster or the nature of the tip. protesters said they had nothing to do with the shooting , saying the demonstrators believe in nonviolence			0
" as the protest was dying down , someone , somewhere got violent			0
now who they were and what group they were affiliated with , we do n't know , " said @entity135 , a @entity3 alderman			0
" in no way are they representative of the thousands of people ... who have been protesting			0
" @entity91 believes someone targeted the police , who have faced heated criticism for months , he said			0
" these police officers were standing there , and they were shot just because they were police officers , " he said			1
the department has been under fire since one of its officers , @entity153 , shot and killed @entity157 - @entity156 teen @entity155 in august , and more recently since a scathing @entity156 @entity159 report documented a pattern of racial discrimination			1
police chief @entity162 resigned wednesday			0
" we are actively addressing the issues that have raised concerns of fairness and fair treatment			0
however , we will not allow , nor tolerate , the destructive and violent actions of a few to disrupt our unifying efforts , " the mayor of @entity8 and the @entity169 said in a statement sunday			2
while the demonstrators ' focus was @entity8 , neither of the wounded officers works for that police department			1
one is from @entity178 , a @entity3 suburb 13 miles south of @entity8			2
the officer -- a 32 - year - old with seven years ' experience -- was shot at the high point of his cheek , just under his right eye , @entity91 said			1
the other was hit in the shoulder and the bullet came out the middle of his back , @entity91 said			0
he is a 41 - year - old officer with the @entity189 , who has been in law enforcement for 14 years			2
both men were treated and released			0
@entity1 's @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207 contributed to this report .			0
