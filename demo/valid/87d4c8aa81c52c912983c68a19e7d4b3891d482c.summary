you think @entity2 is all about basketball ? think again			1
sure , millions will be watching the 2015 @entity2 to see whether @entity5 's bid for an unbeaten season can be quashed or whether a 14 seed can make it to the @entity9			1
but the popularity of the tournament also spawns another kind of madness -- one that includes college applications , vasectomies and hdtv upgrades			1
what are the odds ? ( probably a heck of a lot better than picking a perfect bracket			2
) here are some of the more unusual aspects of the @entity2 : glass slipper , golden payoff cinderella teams do n't just provide a couple weeks ' entertainment ; according to some studies , their success has long - term effects			1
thanks to exposure from the @entity34 , such teams as @entity36 and @entity37 see rises in applications and endowments			2
academics call it the " @entity50 " after the charge @entity44 received from a last - second 1984 win against @entity46 , thanks to a hail mary pass from quarterback @entity49			2
( go ahead and watch it again , we 'll wait			2
) experts debate how much of an influence athletic wins have on admissions , but there 's no question a @entity60 turn gives schools greater exposure , which certainly ca n't hurt			2
@entity37 , which went to the @entity9 in 2006 , and @entity64 , which broke into nationwide consciousness in the late ' 90s , saw applications go up after their turn on stage			2
money in the basket @entity2 pulls in more national tv revenue ( as of 2013 ) than any other postseason sports franchise : $ 1.15 billion			1
a lot of that money comes from fast - food franchises , which know you like to eat while watching the games			0
and those franchises may benefit more from losses than wins			1
according to @entity82 , there 's a 19 % increase in pizza orders and a 9 % rise in dessert orders by fans after their teams lose			1
investors certainly know it : @entity92 stock has traditionally gone up in march			0
making the cut doctors report up to a 50 % rise in the number of vasectomies during the @entity34 tournament			1
well , if you have to spend a few days resting on the couch ... everybody into the pool according to a survey by the outplacement firm @entity104 , 50 million @entity105 participate in @entity2 pools			1
productivity , shmoductivity , part 1 all that bracket - filling costs employers an estimated $ 1.2 billion in unproductive workers ( assuming each worker spends an hour filling out a bracket )			0
@entity82 puts the figure at $ 1.9 billion			0
for all that , employers say the tournament is a net positive on morale			0
productivity , shmoductivity , part 2 twenty - seven percent of respondents to one 2014 survey say they watch games at work			0
( that could explain the morale situation			0
) would you like an upgrade with that ? according to the same 2014 survey , 12 % would upgrade to hdtv if their favorite team made it to the @entity136			1
( as of 2014 , 59 % of @entity105 households have hdtv			0
) bet on the humans of the 76 champions , almost one - third -- 25 -- have had mascots based on a human figure , such as @entity144 and @entity145			1
fourteen have been bear - related ( largely thanks to @entity148 's @entity147 , who have won 11 championships ) and 10 have been feline ( @entity5 's @entity152 , mainly )			0
perhaps you should play the lottery odds of picking a perfect bracket are 9.2 quintillion to 1 , assuming each team has a 50 % chance of winning every game			1
odds of winning @entity161 : about 175 million to 1			0
good luck ! face off against your favorite anchors in the @entity165 bracket challenge @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168 all air portions of the @entity34 tournament			0
those networks are part of @entity173 , as is @entity1 .			0

@entity2 *inspires* men to get vasectomies , *discourages* working
pizza sales go up after losses -- and so do dessert sales
will your team make it to the @entity185 ? might be time to upgrade your tv
