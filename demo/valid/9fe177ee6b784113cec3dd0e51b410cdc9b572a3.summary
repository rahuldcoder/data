@entity0 a photo of a weasel hitching a surprise lift on the back of a flying woodpecker near @entity0 has gone viral on @entity7 , with more than 7,000 users retweeting the original post of the image			1
it was first posted by photographer @entity12 on monday and credited to @entity13 - may			1
after # @entity16 gained momentum , @entity15 media soon picked up the story , and television channel @entity19 interviewed @entity13 - may			1
the amateur photographer from @entity21 , near @entity0 , told the broadcaster he had been walking with his wife in @entity24 , @entity21 , when they heard " a distressed squawking " noise and spotted the woodpecker			1
" just after i switched from my binoculars to my camera the bird flew across us and slightly in our direction ; suddenly it was obvious it had a small mammal on its back and this was a struggle for life , " @entity29 said			2
eventually , @entity13 - may told @entity19 , the weasel -- known as a " least weasel " in some countries -- lost its grip and the bird flew away			1
@entity44 , chief executive of @entity46 's @entity45 told @entity1 the image looked genuine and that it was possible an omnivorous weasel would take on a woodpecker			1
" weasels will go for anything that looks like food -- they 've got a high metabolism and they 've got to eat a lot , " she said			0
" it does n't surprise me that a weasel took a punt -- i 've seen a photo of a weasel charging a group of sparrows , they 're very hungry animals			2
" but she said the weasel , which would generally try to break the neck of its prey to subdue it , may have exceeded its abilities in this case			0
" i think it was a bit of a long shot -- it looks like it tried to grab the neck of the woodpecker to break it , " @entity44 said			0
" i think that it probably does n't have a big enough jaw to bite through the spine of the woodpecker			0
" weasels would not normally target green woodpeckers , @entity44 said -- their predators are normally the size of a stoat or larger			0
but the birds are known to spend a fair amount of time on the ground pulling up worms and hunting insects			0
" if the woodpecker had managed to hit the weasel with its beak it would have been the end of the weasel , " she said			2
" they 're quite gung - ho little creatures			0
" the pluckiness of the weasel spawned a number of parodies on @entity7 , with manipulated images showing the creature in turn being ridden by @entity103 president @entity102 , popstar @entity104 , football star @entity105 -- and even what appears to be a dog red panda dressed in a @entity110 costume			1
( update : @entity7 has now educated us on the difference between a dog and a red panda			2
sorry , @entity116 ! ) as for the bird ? the green woodpecker is also known as a " yaffle " for its laughing call			1
after the shock of being targeted by a hungry weasel wears off , we can only hope it lives up to its nickname .			0
