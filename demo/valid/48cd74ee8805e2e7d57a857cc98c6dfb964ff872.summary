the next time someone accuses you of acting like a @entity2 , do n't be offended			1
just say " thank you			0
" a new study published this month suggests @entity2 were more " cognitively advanced than we give them credit , " @entity5 's @entity4 said in a release			1
@entity4 , a professor emeritus of anthropology , was a part of the study published in the journal @entity14 that looks at eagle talons found in present - day @entity16			1
the talons are among the thousands of human remains , animal bones and tools originally excavated between 1899 and 1905 in the area by @entity16 scientist @entity22			1
only recently , however , did @entity4 identify the cut marks and notches on the 130,000 - year - old bones as ones modified by humans			2
" i was stunned , " @entity4 said of the discovery			0
" it 's so obvious that these are cut			0
" the markings , including polishes and areas where the bones were " rubbed together , " show that the talons were " manipulated into a piece of jewelry , " @entity4 said			1
@entity4 co-wrote " evidence for @entity39 : @entity40 at @entity41 " with three other @entity16 scientists			0
their research indicates @entity2 were more than just the cavemen - like characters depicted in @entity47 commercials , but sophisticated creatures concerned with ornamentation and possibly even an " advanced level of prowess " in catching birds , according to @entity4			1
" we ca n't prove it , but we suspect that they were catching these birds , " he said			2
even with modern technology , catching an eagle is an enormously difficult thing to do			0
@entity4 believes @entity2 must have had excellent " planning skills and ritual " they would 've used in catching the bird			2
" neanderthals are often thought of to be simple - minded mumbling , bumbling , stumbling fools , " @entity4 said			0
" but the more we know about them the more sophisticated they 've become			0

researchers say marking on eagle talons prove @entity2 made jewelry
@entity75 bones used in study more than 130,000 years old
scientist : " it really shows a level of technical sophistication "
