@entity2 , @entity3 it 's a unique world where friendships are forged , deals struck and more than the occasional argument breaks out			0
welcome to @entity3 's free readers associations -- where mostly young men gather around newspaper vendors to read the headlines and debate the issues of the day			1
they are called " free " because nobody actually buys the newspapers they are reading			1
discussions among the free readers are loud and furious and have only intensified as @entity3 goes to the polls to decide who will be the next president			1
newspaper vendor @entity21 , a former shoemaker from @entity3 , who has a stand in @entity25 on @entity26 said that far from being bad for business , he welcomes the free readers			1
" they are passionate about the news and and their presence is an advert for me , " he said			0
@entity21 told @entity4 that he often sees a big rise in numbers around football tournaments , mostly the @entity36 , and also during the election campaign period			0
to avoid losing out on sales too much , @entity21 has developed an interesting business model : " i decided not to make ( reading ) completely free			2
for some of the dailies , its 20 naira , ( 10 cents ) 30 naira ( 15 cents ) for the sports papers and 50 naira ( 30 cents ) for the magazines			2
" it 's not really a static price , it depends on the bargaining power of the person , " he added			0
some even take out a monthly subscription to read the newspapers			2
the free readers come from all walks of life and @entity4 spoke to analysts , an accountant and unemployed youth at the stand we visited			1
they talked about the excitement of discussing the current affairs with others while reading the daily newspaper			0
one told us he had made two very good friends and even landed a job offer			0
@entity21 added there has a been a sharp decline in readers because most people now read their news on the internet			1
he added that the dire economic situation in the country meant that many @entity76 can not afford to buy newspapers			2
most of @entity3 's $ 70 billion oil wealth is concentrated in the hands of a politically connected elite while many of its citizens struggle to make ends meet .			0
