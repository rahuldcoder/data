reading the headlines out of @entity3 , @entity4 , it 's hard not to think about @entity5 , @entity6			1
but law enforcement 's response to the shooting of 19 - year - old @entity11 will not unfold in the same chaotic , violent and distrusting way as the shooting of 18 - year - old @entity14 , @entity3 's top police leaders vowed			1
" i think it 's very clear that @entity3 , @entity4 , is not @entity5 , @entity6 , " said @entity15 , the executive director of the @entity16			1
the head of the state 's largest law enforcement group told @entity1 monday that the @entity3 police department , unlike the @entity5 department , has a strong relationship with the people it serves			1
madison police chief @entity26 has been out front and outspoken about @entity11 's shooting since it happened late friday night			1
the chief said he understands people are angry and want answers			2
" we have to say we are sorry at the outset for it and then we have to show affirmative steps in moving forward to bring community back into the fold , " he said			2
here are some ways @entity3 law enforcement appears to be responding differently than what was seen in @entity5 : difference in what police chiefs did after shooting @entity3 : within hours of the shooting , @entity26 went to @entity11 's mother 's home			1
" we need to start as any healing or any reconciliation should with an ' i 'm sorry , ' and i 've done that privately , and i 'm attempting to do that publicly and that 's the only way we can sort of begin the healing or the rift that may take years if at all to mend , " the police chief said			1
the mother did n't want to meet with him but the chief talked and prayed with the biracial teenager 's grandparents in the driveway , he said			1
they told @entity26 to hold off on trying to talk to the mother because emotions were too intense			0
" i could n't even begin to get my hands around the enormity of the loss and the tragic consequences , " @entity26 said			0
" nineteen years old is too young			0
" he stressed that " the effort has to be there , " in reaching out to the family			2
" we have to acknowledge it , we have to own it , we have to say we are sorry at the outset for it and then we have to show affirmative steps in moving forward to bring community back into the fold , as it were			2
" @entity5 : a day after @entity14 , who was @entity80 , was killed , protesters took to the streets of the @entity6 town			1
they were incensed that witnesses said @entity14 's hands were up and that the teen 's body had remained in the street , in the sun , for four hours			1
a month went by before @entity5 police chief @entity90 apologized to @entity14 's family			1
" i 'm truly sorry for the loss of your son			0
i 'm also sorry that it took so long to remove @entity14 from the street , " he said , in a videotaped message			2
a day after @entity14 's killing a vigil for him devolved into violence			1
police tried to keep the crowd under control but clashes erupted			2
one officer was seen holding the leash of a barking dog , and @entity108 said some officers wielded shotguns			2
four days after @entity14 was killed and more than a day after riots erupted in @entity5 , @entity90 spoke at a community forum , saying , the situation " has been a tragedy for the city and the country			1
" responding to criticism that he 'd missed immediate opportunities to address tension in the town that turned into violence , he said , " it breaks my heart [ that ] some think i 'm part of the problem			0
" the police chief promised the crowd he would be part of the solution			2
but issues with how the department interacted with protesters and media continued			0
" keep moving " was a common refrain that police told protesters and law enforcement threatened to arrest anyone who stood along sidewalks , whether they were resting or a reporter taking notes			2
in some cases , officers told demonstrators they could n't stand for more than five seconds ; some protesters were yelled at for walking too slowly			0
such a tactic was a violation of the @entity151 , a federal judge later ruled			0
in his videotaped message , @entity90 apologized for that , too			2
" the right of the people to peacefully assemble is what the police are here to protect			0
if anyone who was peacefully exercising that right is upset and angry , i feel responsible and i 'm sorry , " the police chief said			2
five ways the @entity5 police chief is in hot water difference in investigation procedures : @entity3 : under @entity4 law , an outside agency is tasked with investigating police - involved shootings			1
in the case in @entity3 , that would be the @entity172			2
once @entity172 completes its work , findings will be delivered to the local district attorney , @entity173 said			0
on monday , gov. @entity177 issued a statement saying that another layer of investigation will come from the @entity181 , which will conduct an independent investigation -- a requirement of all officer - involved deaths			0
@entity5 : chief @entity90 asked the @entity186 to conduct an independent investigation into @entity14 's killing			1
it was only a few days that passed between the shooting and when @entity192 , the chief of @entity186 , told media what led to @entity5 police officer @entity195 shooting @entity14			1
" the genesis of this was a physical confrontation , " @entity192 said			0
@entity14 " physically assaulted " the officer , @entity192 said , and the teen tried to get the officer 's weapon			1
differences with timing of releasing the officer 's name @entity3 : chief @entity26 released the name of the officer who shot @entity11 within hours of the incident			1
he is 12 - year department veteran @entity210			0
the chief volunteered that the officer had shot and killed a man in 2007			2
@entity210 was cleared on any wrongdoing in that incident , the chief said , because an investigation determined that the man was killed in a " suicide by cop " situation			0
during the incident involving @entity11 , @entity210 suffered a blow to the head , @entity26 said			0
he has been placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation			0
@entity5 : three days after @entity14 was killed , @entity5 police backtracked on a promise made a day earlier to release the name of the officer			1
the reason the department gave ? threats made to another officer who was falsely accused on social media of shooting @entity14 , @entity90 said			1
the chief said he thought the threats were " credible " and that " the safety factor far outweighs the benefit from releasing the name , which is minimal			0
" lawyers representing @entity14 's family blasted the decision , and accused the police of protecting their own and ignoring standard procedures			1
difference in how authorities described victim 's past @entity3 : @entity251 documents indicate @entity11 pleaded guilty in december to an armed robbery that occurred last april			1
but when @entity26 was pressed for more details , he refused to talk about the teen 's record or any run - ins with law enforcement			1
" i could but i choose not to , " the chief said			0
" i frankly think it is , for our purposes today , wholly inappropriate and i am not going to blemish anyone 's character , particularly someone 's as young as his			0
" @entity5 : six days after @entity14 's shooting -- on the same day police released officer @entity195 's name -- police released surveillance video of a convenience store robbery in which @entity14 was allegedly involved before he died			1
the decision to release that video frustrated many , including others in law enforcement			0
@entity276 capt. @entity275 stated the robbery and shooting of @entity14 " are separate issues			1
" " i told ( chief @entity90 ) i think both of those being released today was not needed and was not the way that we needed to go , " @entity275 told @entity1			0
" today is about taking care of this incident here , getting to those facts that are there , and @entity14 and his family			1
" differences in mayor 's reaction immediately after shooting @entity3 : less than a day after the shooting , mayor @entity293 vowed that " there will be answers , " the @entity292 reported			1
" we all deserve to know the facts in this case , " he said			0
" @entity11 's family deserves that , our community deserves that , and the @entity3 deserve that			1
when the answers come , we will be open and transparent in communicating them			0
" the promise to be transparent in sharing results of an investigation were repeated on the city 's web site			0
@entity5 : @entity5 mayor @entity311 urged the community to stay calm and not escalate the situation			1
" we do n't know what happened and there are lots of conflicting stories , " @entity311 said			0
" unfortunately there will have to be some time taken to understand what happened			0
hopefully we will get to an understanding and justice will be served			0
" speaking a day after a vigil for @entity14 devolved into a riot , @entity311 said on @entity1 that " the events of last night are not indicative of who we are , " and that the chaos was " not constructive " and only " bringing down the community			1
" difference in size and tone of rallies and tone @entity3 : on friday night , dozens of demonstrators gathered in @entity3			2
" who do we trust ? " some called out , prompting the response , " no one ! " and in another refrain , they chanted , " black lives matter , " a phrase that @entity5 protesters coined			2
online the @entity345 hashtag , referencing to @entity346 , where the shooting happened , trended			0
" praying for @entity3 tonight , " wrote one activist			2
" @entity349 , sit in , walk out - until u get answers			0
and until there are no more hashtag eulogies			0
" the demonstrations , which have been constant , have remained peaceful			0
watch protesters outraged over police killing @entity5 : just hours after @entity14 was killed , a vigil for him turned violent as people hurled bottles at officers and kicked police cars parked on the streets			1
the often - violent demonstrations continued off and on for weeks , and protests around the country were held in solidarity			0
while many protesters were peaceful , in late november buildings were set on fire and destruction spread after a grand jury said it had decided not to indict officer @entity195			0
fire , chaos erupt in @entity5 after grand jury does n't indict @entity1 's @entity375 , @entity376 , @entity377 , @entity378 , @entity379 , @entity380 , @entity381 and @entity382 contributed to this report .			1

police officials in @entity3 say their responses to shooting by officer *reflect* their role in community
one example : @entity3 chief talked to teen 's family soon after shooting
a month went by before @entity5 chief apologized to @entity14 's family
