if you enjoy laughing at the @entity3 football team -- calling all @entity4 and @entity5 -- and you have a spare $ 900,000 , then @entity6 's has the very thing for you			1
the auction house is offering an untitled work by @entity11 sculptor @entity10 that chronicles -- in painstaking and painful detail if you are @entity3 -- every defeat suffered by the @entity3 team between 1874 and 1998			1
@entity10 has carved all the defeats into a large ( and it would have to be , would n't it ? ) piece of black granite , meaning the lucky buyer can be constantly reminded of a succession of ignominious afternoons and evenings			1
the artist says of his memorial stone - style work simply : " i guess it 's a piece which talks about pride , missed opportunities and death			0
" known for his humorous and satirical art , @entity10 had plenty to work with as he recorded defeats starting with a 2 - 1 loss to @entity5 in @entity35 in 1874 and ending with another 2 - 1 setback against @entity37 at the @entity38			2
since then , of course , he 'd have had a fair few more to immortalize , including the two to @entity11 and @entity40 in @entity41 last summer that were part of the worst - ever @entity3 display at a @entity38			0
the artist , whose other works include @entity47 ( @entity48 ) , which depicts pope @entity49 being struck down by a meteorite , first put his football piece on display at an exhibition in @entity54 in 1999			2
it 's not known whether any @entity3 managers and players , past or present , came along to have a sneaky look			0
current @entity3 boss @entity59 is known to be a bit of an @entity61 , but the former @entity63 coach needs to be quick if he wants catch a glimpse -- @entity10 's work is on public exhibition at @entity68 galleries until tuesday 10 march			1
it will then be offered as part of the single - owner ' bear witness ' sale .			0
