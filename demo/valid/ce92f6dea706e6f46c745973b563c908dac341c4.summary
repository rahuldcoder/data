@entity0 go to the polls saturday to determine who will lead @entity5 's most populous nation			1
the stakes are high in this election as the nation faces intensified attacks by extremist group @entity10			1
with security catapulting into a key issue , which candidate will voters trust to keep them safe ? as @entity0 decides , here 's what you need to know : @entity0 is home to about 173 million people and is considered a powerhouse in the region			1
its stability is crucial to combating the growing risk of @entity25 terrorists , who thrive on instability			1
as @entity10 seeks to extend its tentacles with its recent pledge of allegiance to @entity30 , @entity0 has teamed up with neighboring @entity31 and @entity32 in a counteroffensive against the terror group			1
and it appears to be working , with its military saying it has recaptured several key cities from the militants			1
the next leader will have to ensure the gains stay on track			1
as we have learned with isis in @entity44 and @entity45 , any unaddressed local insurgency has the potential to spiral into an international problem			1
and let 's face it , the world does not need another failing state , especially one with such a massive population			1
@entity0 is also one of @entity5 's largest oil producers and is a major supplier of crude oil to the @entity57			1
it hosts many international oil companies and workers			2
the key issues are power , security and the economy			2
but with the rise of @entity10 , security has taken center stage			1
just this year alone , the extremists have killed at least 1,000 civilians , @entity66 says			2
one of the militants ' most brutal acts was the kidnapping of nearly 300 schoolgirls last april , a majority of whom are still missing			2
@entity10 has become increasingly brazen , seizing towns in bloody attacks and declaring them @entity79 caliphates			1
militants have bombed schools , churches and mosques ; kidnapped women and children ; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike			2
although the current government is " having successes here and there " in its fight against @entity10 , it 's not winning the war against the terror group , says @entity96 , a documentary filmmaker and analyst on @entity99 affairs			1
and despite recapturing some key towns from militants , he says , the government 's big picture on security is still hazy			2
" this elections will come down to who can protect @entity0 , " @entity96 says			2
" who can make @entity0 feel safe			2
" @entity0 overtook @entity5 as the region 's largest economy last year			2
the government has made tremendous gains on the economy , @entity96 says , but those gains have been buried under the constant threat of @entity10			1
but many complain that the country 's vast wealth from oil exports does not trickle down to the average citizen			0
as many as 70 % of @entity0 live below the poverty line and survive on less than a dollar a day , according to the @entity122			0
@entity0 is under economic pressure because of falling crude oil prices worldwide and a weakened currency			0
corruption has been a hindrance to building a stable economy despite years of democracy , analysts say			0
there are 14 candidates on the ballot , but the race is more of a rematch between the current president and a former military ruler			0
the two faced off in the last election in 2011			1
president @entity140 : @entity140 rode a wave of popularity in 2011			0
at the time , he portrayed himself as a man of the people			0
during campaigns , he talked about growing up without shoes , a message that resonated with average @entity0			0
but in recent years , his popularity has plummeted , with @entity0 saying he has not delivered on his promises for change			0
key officials have defected from his ruling @entity152 to the newly formed @entity153			0
@entity154 : the retired general has unsuccessfully run for election three times			1
@entity154 ruled @entity0 in the 1980s following a military coup and was known for his tough regime , which some say was marked by human rights abuses			0
but he has pledged to make fighting graft and insecurity a priority if he wins , which might appeal to those who 've run out of patience with the current government			0
his military rule background could be a plus or a minus			0
" many @entity0 will not forget he was a military leader , during a dictatorship , " @entity96 says			0
" or maybe they will feel that they need a military leader to address fundamental problems such as terrorism			0
" the election was originally scheduled for february 14 , but was delayed for six weeks			1
in addition to the presidential elections , @entity0 will elect governors in 36 states			0
like their @entity57 counterparts , the nation 's governors have a lot of clout			1
not only do they set priorities for federal funds , they are also responsible for security in their states and are thus the first line of defense against extremists , especially in the @entity195 , where militants have free rein			0
in populated cities such as @entity200 , governors manage economies larger than those of some @entity99 countries			0
to avoid a runoff , a candidate must get more than 50 % of the vote and at least a quarter in two - thirds of the states			0
if no candidate wins , a runoff election will be held seven days later			1
