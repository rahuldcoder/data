as a november dawn breaks over an @entity4 bar in downtown @entity5 , the early risers inside are hunkered down to watch @entity6 begin his chase for a second formula one world title			1
it 's mid-morning in @entity10 and @entity11 , her husband @entity12 and their four - year - old daughter are also glued to the tv to watch their hero in the season - ending @entity17			1
on the verdant @entity20 in the @entity21 , three thousand miles from the desert showdown , another @entity6 fan anxiously waits for the @entity23 man to race to his fate			1
these supporters , and others around the world from @entity28 to @entity29 , had voiced their hopes in video messages and their supplications on social media			2
when @entity6 flicked down his visor , revved the @entity23 ' engine and hit the throttle , a global surge of support roared			1
" we came out at 6am on sunday morning to watch the race in a bar in @entity46 , " @entity5 , and self confessed @entity41 fan , @entity42 told @entity1			2
" we met up with fans from all over ; we had a guy from the @entity49 and one guy even took a bus from @entity52 just to watch the race			2
" we also made videos and sent them to @entity6 ' website using the @entity55			1
" in @entity10 , self - styled @entity59 , " who is married to @entity61 , " also used the hashtag to communicate with her idol			2
she told @entity1 : " i support @entity6 every day but during the races i am aware of everything , even practice and all the interviews			1
" at all times he knows he can count on our support , in good times or bad			2
i am extremely proud to be a fan of his			2
" when @entity6 won in @entity70 -- in easier circumstances than expected thanks to an engine problem for rival @entity74 -- and sealed the 2014 championship he was quick to thank his fans in the post-race media conference			1
" i always say we win and lose together , " he smiled			0
" the love and energy that i get from my fans ... it really made me believe that i can do anything			2
" racing in a global championship has helped @entity88 gain fame across international borders			0
in 2015 , the @entity91 series will visit an air - mile clocking 20 countries			1
but when the 30 - year - old @entity96 lines up for sunday 's season - opening @entity97 @entity17 , he will do so as the most famous face on the grid			1
" @entity6 has over three million @entity104 fans -- with a third of those coming from the @entity49 -- and he has 2.6 million @entity107 followers , " explained @entity100 , managing director of leading sports and entertainment market research company @entity101			1
" he has a very strong following			0
compared to other @entity91 drivers , @entity6 is also right up there in most of the sport 's key markets in terms of celebrity awareness			1
" in the big markets -- @entity10 , @entity116 , @entity117 and the @entity49 -- he scores in the top three			0
@entity120 is the only other [ ever - present ] driver			2
" @entity121 , whose company @entity123 runs @entity6 's digital media , decided to tap into the racing star 's global appeal in the build - up to the sizzling @entity70 finale			1
" we saw that @entity6 ' fans were talking to one another and so we came up with the protocol # @entity55 , " explains @entity121			1
@entity123 then devised a real time app , which enabled them to record and upload video messages of support			0
these twin projects enabled @entity121 and his team to have a better understanding of the geography and demographic of @entity6 's followers			1
" his fanbase is enormously international , " he said			0
" around 50 % of them are from the @entity49 but then there are a lot in @entity147 , @entity10 and the @entity148 30,000 fans uploaded videos from 50 countries			2
" there was also a surprisingly high female following , which is probably connected to [ his former girlfriend popstar ] @entity155			0
" the video messages was then edited into four films , which were broadcast daily on @entity6 's social platforms over the race weekend			1
the final film on race day had a million views on @entity104 in one day alone			1
thank you all so much # @entity55 @ mercedesamgf1 @entity168 @entity6 himself explained the concept , and the emotional response it generated within him , after the race			1
" this weekend the guy who does my website put together a collage of different clips of messages from people , " he said			0
" i really did n't know what to expect			0
when i got it there was something happening in my heart			0
i ca n't really explain it			0
" @entity42 and his fiancée @entity185 , as well as @entity11 and her family and the @entity20 fan , were featured in the films			0
" it was important to us personally , " @entity42 said			0
" it 's a big deal for us making a video and seeing him acknowledge his fans			2
" @entity42 , who is originally from @entity195 in @entity196 , has also been galvanizing global support for @entity6 through social media for the last five years			1
he explained : " the idea percolated at the @entity200 @entity17 in 2010			1
my brother - in - law @entity201 had a huge painted banner -- it looked like something a five - year - old did -- but at the bottom it said ' # @entity207 -- we believe			0
' " we started using it and @entity107 was soon blown up with # @entity207			1
the initial idea was to unite crew members in @entity212 but when i go on @entity107 and @entity104 i see people from @entity117 , the @entity214 , the @entity49 and @entity215			1
" it 's a global base and we are trying to make it bigger			0
right now , we use # @entity207 to meet up at races but we 've started work on a website			0
" @entity6 's mass appeal is not just because he 's an @entity91 driver and now a double world champion			1
he has something the other 17 drivers simply do n't have -- a narrative to rival a bestselling novel , a blockbuster script			0
born in @entity228 , a commuter town 30 miles north of @entity230 , he broke boundaries when he debuted in 2007 as @entity91 's first black driver			1
he revealed on his website when his career began he " tried to ignore that fact " but has now " really started to appreciate the implications			0
" @entity6 's mixed heritage -- his mother is white @entity49 and his father 's family have roots in the @entity243 -- and a rags - to - riches success story have both helped him connect with a wider fanbase			1
" there 's a crossover that appeals to many , many backgrounds , " said @entity42			0
" he 's diverse , but not just [ in ] race but in his social likings too			0
" he hangs out with top celebrities like @entity252 and @entity253			0
this hip - hop style and the fact that he spends a lot of time in the @entity148 make him one of the few drivers who actually appeals to @entity148			0
" @entity121 agreed : " @entity6 is a bit different			1
he invites a whole new set of people into @entity91 , people who might be put off by the rich , white , middle - classness of it all			1
" @entity6 has also always worn his heart on his sleeve against a backdrop of fierce racing rivalry -- usually with his teammates --- and an on - off romance with @entity155			1
there have been some mesmerizing moments on track , and some famous meltdowns off it			0
perhaps most remembered was his outburst at the @entity276			0
@entity6 had been penalized by race stewards after finishing sixth and exclaimed to the media : " it 's an absolute frickin ' joke			1
maybe it 's because i 'm black			0
that 's what @entity282 says			0
" many of @entity6 's fans -- though not all -- warm to these moments of human frailty as much as his derring - do on the racetrack , and draw inspiration from both			1
@entity11 races go karts in @entity10 and , although she credits her husband @entity12 for his practical support , she also takes heart from @entity88			0
" @entity6 is a fighter , he faced many prejudices and difficult days but he never gave up on his dream ; he teaches us that , " @entity11 explained			1
" in addition to his talent as a wonderful driver , he has a big heart , a great willpower			2
" many friends are astonished to see me kart racing because i dispute championships with many men , and women on the track are in the minority			0
" i win often but women suffer some kind of prejudice			0
i do not really care , i care to always do my best and be inspired by the best drivers			0
" @entity11 has met @entity6 at many @entity10 @entity314			1
" all my meetings with @entity6 are fantastic and happy			1
he is a charismatic and kind person			0
he really loves his fans			2
" @entity42 , like @entity11 , has met @entity6 " tonnes of times " in and around grand prix weekends			2
" he seems like a down to earth guy , " @entity42 revealed			0
" he 's not one of those guys who signs an autograph and shoves it back to you			0
he actually talks and spends time with you			0
" @entity42 and his fiancée @entity185 are so impressed with the @entity49 racer that they graced him with a special honor			0
" the first person we invited verbally to our wedding was @entity6 , " @entity42 explained			2
" we met him in the pit lane at the @entity148 @entity17 last year , he hung out with us , took selfies and we alluded to the fact that we were getting married and said ' hey you 're the first invite			2
' " we are trying to set a date around the summer break			0
we ca n't set the date on a race weekend ! " being a global personality offers the ability to change people 's lives even in a small way but for @entity6 , the relationship he has with his fans appears to be mutualistic			1
" @entity6 is genuinely indebted to his fans , " said @entity121			1
" he always sees his fans as the core of his powerbase			2
" when he drives out of the garage in @entity97 , the world champion may be racing to end the season as @entity354 but he also carries the hearts and hopes of millions			1
does @entity6 have what it takes to transcend the track and become a global sporting superstar ? find out in @entity361 published on thursday .			2
