things got testy on " @entity2 " when conservative commentator @entity3 charged that rappers like @entity5 are profiting off the n - word			1
" i 'll be honest with you , " @entity3 told @entity5 on monday night			1
" i think you know that we should probably get rid of the n - word , but in reality , i think many rappers are afraid they will lose out on money and sales and street cred if they do n't stop using the word			1
" the two were part of a panel discussion about who can say the n - word			0
the panel also included @entity1 commentator @entity21			0
" i 'm making money off of doing music and being creative , sir , " @entity5 responded			1
" i 'm not making money just because i use the n - word			1
nobody goes to buy an album because it 's full of the n - word			0
" to which @entity3 responded : " @entity30 , you would n't be on this show tonight if it was n't for using the n - word in your rap music			1
" @entity5 is the rapper whose hit song , " @entity35 , " is heard playing in the background as the house mother of the @entity40 @entity39 house -- known as @entity41 -- was caught on a @entity43 video repeating the n - word seven times on camera			2
the woman , @entity46 , was bombarded with claims that she 's just as racist as the fraternity members who were caught singing a racist song on a bus earlier this month			0
in a previous interview with @entity1 , @entity5 said he was willing to give the house mom a pass -- though he said he did n't condone her use of the word			2
but when @entity3 said monday the rapper was only on the show for his use of the word , the third panelist -- @entity21 -- quickly jumped in			2
" he would n't be on the show if a white woman had n't said the n - word on a tape , " he said			0
" white people have been saying the [ n - word ] long before @entity30 was born			0
" watch the full exchange above .			0
