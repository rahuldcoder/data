@entity0 spent 22 years on death row , convicted of conspiring with two other men to kill her son allegedly for an insurance payout			1
on monday , a judge ruled that the @entity8 woman is innocent and dismissed all charges against her			0
this makes @entity0 only the second woman exonerated from death row in the @entity13			1
more importantly , the judge 's decision finally clears @entity0 after years of legal back - and - forth in a case where she steadfastly maintained her innocence			1
@entity25 to the case 's dismissal was prosecutorial misconduct , mainly that of a detective , @entity21 , who said @entity0 confessed to the crime to him -- even though there was no witness or recording			1
prosecutors withheld from the jury @entity21 's personnel record which showed instances of misconduct in other cases , including lying under oath			1
the two men with whom @entity0 was accused of conspiring were tried separately and are still on death row			1
a day after seeing @entity41 at a mall on december 1 , 1989 , young @entity40 asked his mother if he could go again			0
@entity0 's roomate , @entity44 , took the boy ; then called @entity0 saying @entity40 had disappeared			1
instead , @entity44 and a friend drove the boy out of town to a secluded ravine where @entity44 shot @entity40 three times in the head , prosecutors said			0
@entity44 and the friend were convicted of murder and sentenced to death			1
@entity0 was implicated based on alleged testimony from @entity57 's friend , @entity56			1
the detective , @entity21 , said @entity56 told him that @entity0 was involved in a plot to kill her son			1
and during her trial , prosecutors floated a likely motive : a $ 5,000 life insurance policy she had taken out on the child			0
but neither @entity56 nor @entity44 testified to a plot in court			0
no other witnesses or direct evidence linked @entity0 to the crime other than @entity21 's testimony			1
@entity21 further said that @entity0 confessed to her role in the murder plot during interrogation and said it was a " bad judgment call			1
" there was no recording of the interrogation , no one else was in the room or watching from a two - way mirror , and @entity21 said he threw away his notes shortly after completing his report			0
@entity0 offered a vastly different view of the interrogation and denied that she had confessed to any role			1
the trial became a he - said / she - said contest between the two			0
ultimately , the jury believed the detective and convicted @entity0 of murder			1
what prosecutors did n't tell the court was the detective 's long history of lying under oath and misconduct			1
@entity21 had been suspended five days for taking " liberties " with a female motorist and lying about it to his supervisors			2
four confessions or indictments had been tossed out because @entity21 had lied under oath			0
judges suppressed or vacated four other confessions because @entity21 had violated a person 's constitutional rights			0
in 2013 , after more than 20 years in jail , an appeals court overturned @entity0 's conviction			2
" the @entity114 requires a fair trial , " chief judge @entity112 of the federal 9th @entity113 wrote			0
" this never happened in @entity0 's case			2
" " the state knew of the evidence in the personnel file and had an obligation to produce the documents , " @entity112 said			0
" ... there can be no doubt that the state failed in its constitutional obligation			0
" @entity0 was released on bail , and the court said she could n't be tried again			2
the state appealed the decision to the @entity131			0
last week , the @entity131 refused to hear the appeal			0
and on monday , all charges against @entity0 were finally dropped			2
the ankle bracelet she had been wearing while on bail was removed			0
and @entity0 left the court room , sobbing in relief			2
the case is now closed			0
@entity0 is finally a free woman .			2

@entity0 was convicted of murder in her son 's death , given the death *penalty*
there was no evidence tying her to the crime , but a detective said she confessed
this detective had a " history of misconduct , " including lying under oath
