@entity2 as the dust settles after @entity5 's high court ruled on friday to overturn the latest guilty verdicts for @entity7 , 27 , and her former @entity5 boyfriend @entity8 , 31 , in the 2007 murder of @entity10 , many questions still linger in the case			1
@entity12 and @entity8 were tried together and convicted of murder by two separate courts			1
but now they are free now , forever cleared			0
there wo n't be any civil trials like in the @entity19 case because , according to @entity5 penal code , @entity5 's high court decision is final across all courts in the country			1
according to @entity5 lawyer @entity24 , who works on extradition and criminal cases between @entity5 and other countries , " the high court decision is seen as the truth for the whole system			1
" what now for the @entity32 ? @entity33 , lawyer for the @entity35 family , told @entity3 that his clients are disappointed with the final ruling			2
" we expected more from the @entity5 judicial system , " he said			1
" this is a failure to find justice for @entity10			2
" @entity33 says the @entity32 could try to appeal to the @entity42 and argue that @entity5 failed to find those culpable of killing their beloved daughter and sister but they have yet to make that decision			2
" if they think @entity5 has n't fulfilled the duty , they could sue @entity5 , " @entity24 told @entity3			1
such a claim could be made based on the final conviction handed down to @entity10 , a man from the @entity52 who was convicted for his role in @entity35 's murder in 2008 in a fast - track trial that is still under seal			1
when the high court ruled definitively on his case in 2010 , they wrote explicitly in their reasoning that he was one of three assailants but did not name who they were			0
@entity12 and @entity8 both spent four years in prison during their initial trial and first appeal			1
they applied to @entity5 's high court to be put under house arrest but because @entity12 was a foreigner and deemed a flight risk , they were both denied			1
@entity8 may now have cause to sue @entity5 for false imprisonment			1
@entity5 pays around â‚¬ 12 million every year for locking up people who are later cleared of charges , according to @entity5 prime minister @entity77 who is introduced measures to reform the judicial system			1
but , @entity24 says if @entity8 at any time lied to investigators before he was arrested , he may forfeit his right to reimbursement for being held			0
@entity8 changed his story more than once before finally settling on an alibi with @entity12 , so a legal battle could focus on whether anything he told investigators led directly to his arrest			1
@entity24 also says that @entity12 could potentially sue @entity5 for one year of false imprisonment , but because she admittedly lied to investigators early on which led to her arrest , she would likely not have much of a case			1
" because she initially admitted to a role in the crime , she would n't likely win			0
if a suspect lies to investigators before they are arrested , it is difficult to prove they were falsely imprisoned , " @entity24 says			0
in one of her initial interrogations in 2007 , she told investigators she was in the house when @entity35 was killed at which time she accused @entity10 , her boss at a pub where she worked , of the murder			1
she later recanted that statement , but @entity108 spent two weeks in prison because of her false claim			0
in 2013 , @entity5 's high court ruled definitively on a slander charge against her for the false accusation and upheld a three - year prison term and ordered her to pay @entity108 $ 40,000 euro			2
@entity12 's lawyer @entity116 told @entity3 that @entity12 does n't feel any revenge or resentment towards @entity5			1
in fact , he said she will go back one day			0
" this has been an nightmare for her , so we finally got the right decision , " he said			0
" we always thought this was the only decision possible			0
" @entity8 's lawyers were equally pleased with the outcome			2
" the verdict that we just received does n't prove us partly right , it proves us completely right , " @entity127 told reporters outside the court			0
" there were two possible verdicts : ( one was to ) overturn this verdict , but go back to it later			0
instead , the overturn is without any referral			0
among all the possible and imaginable overturning options , this is the one which says " be advised , we wo n't ever even make the hypothesis of an implication of @entity8 in this case ever			2
enough , enough , enough			0
" @entity12 , too , made her own statement from her mother 's home in @entity148 after hearing the news			2
she thanked all those who supported her innocence , and said she needed to take time to digest what being free really means			0
when asked if she had a message to the @entity32 about their daughter , she said , " she deserved so much in this life			0
i 'm the lucky one			0

@entity12 and @entity8 were tried together and convicted of murder , but now cleared
family of victim @entity10 " expected more from the @entity5 judicial system "
@entity12 's lawyer says @entity12 does n't feel any revenge or resentment towards @entity5
