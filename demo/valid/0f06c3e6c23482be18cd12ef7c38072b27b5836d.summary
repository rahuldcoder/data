she married a man whose first wife mysteriously disappeared			0
and she stood by him even after he admitted killing a neighbor and chopping up the body			0
but who is @entity7 , the wife of millionaire heir @entity8 ? and what role has she played in his life ? @entity7 has n't spoken publicly since her husband 's arrest in @entity14 over the weekend , and @entity1 was unable to reach her for comment			1
in " @entity19 , " the @entity17 documentary about @entity8 's life , she appears in a police interview from more than a decade ago			1
the series also includes excerpts from jailhouse recordings of phone conversations between @entity8 and @entity25			2
@entity7 says she met @entity8 in 1988 , six years after his first wife went missing			1
the two were married in a rushed ceremony just weeks before @entity8 's longtime friend @entity29 turned up dead in @entity30 , @entity31			1
this week , the @entity33 's @entity32 charged @entity8 with first - degree murder in that case			1
it 's an accusation he has long denied			0
he also has said he had nothing to do with his first wife 's disappearance			2
in a 2003 trial , he admitted he 'd shot a neighbor in @entity42 , @entity43 , and dismembered the body , but was acquitted of murder after arguing he 'd acted in self defense			0
recorded jailhouse calls from @entity8 's imprisonment during that case suggest that @entity7 was his rock			1
" am i supposed to be smiling or am i supposed to be grim ? " @entity8 asks in one conversation discussing how he should appear during his trial			2
@entity53 quickly replies , " i would just have as close to no expression , yeah , that 's what i think			0
" she was also a driving force behind the decision to fire attorney @entity58 , a lawyer @entity8 's wealthy real estate developer family had tapped to handle the case			1
the insanity defense @entity58 was planning to use , she said at the time , could have meant both @entity8 and @entity7 were cut out of the family fortune			1
" what he does n't want is me to get any of the trust money later on , since i 'm not your wife because you were incompetent at the time , ok , that means they are the only ones who can make your decisions , " she says in another call			2
like @entity8 himself , @entity7 is a powerful player on the @entity76 real estate scene			1
" she 's not some opportunistic woman who came into @entity79 's life for monetary gain			0
she was very successful , a millionaire several times over long before she met @entity79 , " said @entity81 , publisher of @entity82			0
@entity83 , the retired judge who presided over the 2003 trial , said from listening to hours of tapes and testimony that it 's clear that @entity25 is motivated by financial gain			0
" it 's very clear that she only cares about the money , " @entity89 said			0
some former friends and employees described @entity7 in less than glowing terms			2
former employees have successfully sued her for failing to pay commissions			0
according to sources , she only briefly lived with @entity8 and they are now separated , though still married			2
why does n't the @entity17 documentary feature any more recent interviews with her ? @entity7 did n't want @entity8 to participate in " @entity19 , " @entity81 said , and she has n't spoken with him since it started airing			1
@entity1 's @entity101 and @entity102 contributed to this report .			0

@entity7 @entity105 is @entity8 's second wife
she has n't spoken publicly since his arrest in @entity14
she told police she met @entity8 in 1988 , six years after his first wife went missing
