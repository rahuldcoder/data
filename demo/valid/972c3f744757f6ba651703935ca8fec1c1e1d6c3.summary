@entity0 released @entity3 documents , including letters to and from @entity5 in the year or so before his may 2011 death , show an organization that understood it had severe problems resulting from the @entity10 drone program that was killing many of the group 's leaders in @entity15 's tribal regions bordering @entity16			1
as a result of this pressure , @entity3 officials were seriously considering relocating elements of the organization to other countries such as @entity16 or @entity23			2
they also entered into ceasefire discussions through intermediaries with elements of @entity15 's intelligence service , @entity27 , although the documents suggest that nothing came of these discussions and there is no evidence in the documents indicating that the @entity15 government had any clue about @entity5 's location or presence in @entity15			1
@entity10 efforts to spy on the group and kill its leaders were so effective that in june 2010 an @entity3 official urged @entity5 , " you should have fewer exchanges of correspondence with us during this period			1
make the period between contacts longer and further apart			0
take excessive caution and care , especially this year			0
" this was wise counsel			0
within a few weeks of this letter being written , the @entity10 would track @entity5 's trusted courier to his longtime hideout in @entity56 , @entity15 , and on may 1 , 2011 , a @entity58 operation ordered by president @entity59 killed @entity3 's leader			1
the new @entity3 documents are part of a trove of many thousands that the @entity58 recovered at @entity5 's compound			1
several were released during the @entity67 trial last month of @entity3 operative @entity68			2
seventeen of these documents had also been released around the first anniversary of @entity5 's death			1
it 's long past time for the government to release more of these thousands of captured documents -- with any necessary redactions for national security purposes -- as they help us to understand better what precipitated the decline and fall of the terrorist group that once dominated the attention of the world , just as @entity83 does today			2
the documents show how @entity3 's 9/11 operation unleashed so much force against it , including the @entity10 drone program , that it had to hide in the shadows and could n't pull off any successful operation in the @entity90 for many years before the death of @entity5			1
the documents demonstrate that almost a decade after 9/11 @entity3 was struggling to get any kind of operation going against @entity96 targets			1
in a report on " external operations , " an @entity3 official explained that a plot to attack the @entity101 in @entity102 had fizzled and that despite sending @entity3 members to the @entity105 to hit " several targets " these operations had also come to nothing			2
@entity3 had also sent " three brothers " on a terrorist mission to @entity110 , a country that @entity5 loathed because of the publication by a @entity110 newspaper of cartoons of the @entity114 , but had " lost contact with them			1
" given all the problems the group was having , an @entity3 strategist suggested refocusing efforts on carrying out terrorist attacks using the " simplest things such as household knives , gas tanks , fuel , diesel and others like airplanes , trains and cars as killing tools			2
" 2011 : @entity132 offers details about @entity5 raid a major theme of the documents is how much punishment the @entity10 drone program was inflicting on @entity3			1
@entity3 officials considered moving to @entity140 , a remote mountainous region of eastern @entity16 , or to other parts of @entity15 such as @entity142 or @entity143 and even to @entity23 , which had been a key sanctuary for a number of @entity3 's leaders after the fall of the @entity148 in late 2001			1
@entity3 mulled opening an office in @entity23 , but " we backed off this idea due to financial costs and other considerations			0
" in a letter to @entity5 , an @entity3 official provided a vivid description of the death by drone of @entity158 , then the no. 3 leader of the group , on the night of may 22 , 2010			1
the @entity3 official wrote that @entity158 was staying at the house of a " well - known " supporter of @entity3 when a drone started making " distinctive loops that we all know and all the brothers have experienced			2
they all know that if a plane starts doing these turns , it is going to strike			0
" @entity158 and his wife and three daughters and granddaughter were all killed in the drone strike , according to the official			0
the official lamented that drones are " still circling our skies every day " and the only relief from them came when weather conditions worsened and there was cloud cover			0
the official wrote but " then they come back when the sky is clear			0
" @entity3 had tried to use jamming technology and to hack into the drones " but no result so far , " according to the @entity3 official			0
underlining @entity3 's weakness , during the summer of 2010 the group was contemplating some kind of ceasefire with the @entity15 government and had entered into negotiations with it via intermediaries to explain that @entity3 's battle was " primarily against the @entity132			1
you became part of the battle when you sided with the @entity132			0
if you were to leave us and our affairs alone , we would leave you alone			0
" highlights of @entity5 documents released in 2012 the documents show that such a ceasefire was purely tactical rather than the beginning of some kind of rapprochement between @entity3 and the @entity15			1
at one point an @entity3 official referred to " @entity5 's call to jihad against the apostate government of @entity15			1
" apostasy is a grave crime in @entity213 and punishable by death in the eyes of members of @entity3			0
according to the documents , @entity15 intelligence officials " reached out to " @entity3 through longtime jihadist sympathizers who had formerly held positions in the @entity15 intelligence agency , @entity27 , as well as the leaders of militant groups such as the @entity148 faction that have contacts with the @entity27			2
the documents suggest that nothing came of these discussions , and there is no evidence in them that the @entity15 had any idea that @entity5 was in @entity15 or indeed was even alive			2
bergen in 2013 : @entity5 's life on the run moreover during the course of reporting the book " @entity240 , " about the @entity10 's long search for @entity5 , i spoke to several senior @entity132 officials who said that the @entity132 intelligence community was covertly monitoring the communications of @entity15 army chief @entity244 and @entity27 director @entity245 the night of the @entity5 raid and they were both surprised about him being in @entity56			1
the documents did show one area of real success for @entity3 , which was kidnapping for ransom , a tactic @entity83 has been using so effectively			1
in 2008 , @entity3 had captured @entity16 's former ambassador to @entity15 , @entity252			2
after two years of negotiations he was exchanged for $ 5 million			0
an @entity3 official told @entity5 that some of this money would be a " gift " to him " from all the brothers			2
" @entity5 cautioned @entity3 's leaders to be careful with the ransom money , as it might have to last the terrorist group several years			1
the documents show that @entity3 's leaders were in contact with @entity264 , a close aide to @entity148 leader @entity265			1
@entity264 has met with @entity132 officials on a number of occasions to discuss peace negotiations			0
2011 : how @entity132 forces killed @entity5 far from the image of the isolated man in the cave that was prevalent before he was killed , the documents portray @entity5 as a hands - on manager of @entity3			1
in a 10 - page letter that @entity5 wrote in august 2010 , he had reams of advice for the @entity3 - aligned group @entity280 in @entity281 , ordering that the group not attack @entity283 in @entity281 and also suggesting a plan to assassinate the president of neighboring @entity286 who had sent his troops to fight @entity280			1
@entity5 gave detailed notes about how @entity280 could raise its agricultural output by using small dams for irrigation , and he suggested planting palm olive trees imported from @entity294			0
he also advised @entity280 against cutting down too many trees because it is " dangerous for the environment of the region			0
" @entity5 had lived in nearby @entity298 in the mid- ' 90s , establishing a number of business and farming enterprises			0
@entity5 , something of a micromanager , told his top lieutenant to " send us the resumes of all the brothers who may be nominated now or in the future for important management positions			0
" he also cautioned against sending any emails , including even encrypted ones , urging that hand - delivered letters were the only safe method of communication			0
bergen on 2012 documents : seized documents show delusional leader and micromanager @entity5 also ordered that some of the tens of thousands of documents leaked by @entity323 pvt. @entity322 to @entity324 in 2010 be translated so that @entity3 could better understand " the enemy 's policies in the region			1
" and he suggested that his lieutenants reach out to @entity329 , an @entity330 reporter based in @entity15 who had interviewed @entity5 in the past , so that he could have plenty of time to prepare a report to mark the 10th anniversary of 9/11			0
@entity5 said he did n't want @entity329 to interview any members of his family , but he told his team to get in touch with the reporter " promptly " to get a sense of the questions he wanted @entity5 to answer			0
@entity5 was killed four months before the 10th anniversary of 9/11			0
as the new @entity3 documents make clear he died knowing that his dream of another terrorism spectacular in the @entity90 was just that : a dream			2
and the organization that he had founded was in deep trouble because of the @entity10 drone program			2
note : an earlier version of this article incorrectly said @entity5 had lived in @entity281 .			0

new documents show @entity3 's desperate straits in @entity5 's final years
