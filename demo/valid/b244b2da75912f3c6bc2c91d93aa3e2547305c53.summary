with tensions running high after the shooting of two officers in @entity5 , @entity6 , state and county police took over protest security in the @entity10 suburb thursday			1
@entity11 and the @entity12 are assuming " command of the security detail regarding protests , " @entity11 said , while @entity13 will remain responsible for " routine policing services " in the city			1
the takeover came less than a day after two police officers standing guard outside @entity5 police headquarters were shot in what @entity10 police chief @entity23 called an " ambush , " spurring a manhunt for those responsible for targeting the line of officers			1
" we could have buried two police officers , " @entity23 told reporters			1
" ... i feel very confident that whoever did this ... came there for whatever nefarious reason that it was			0
" @entity23 said several people " have been very forthright " with investigators , but authorities have n't released the names of any possible suspects			1
investigators believe they have identified two people they want to question in the shooting , and one of them might be the shooter , a law enforcement official said			1
police are also trying to find anyone who may have helped the shooter get away			1
this is n't the first time that county police and state troopers have stepped in to handle protest security			1
when clashes between police and protesters boiled over last year , @entity6 's governor declared a state of emergency and tapped the @entity12 to take over			1
after that emergency declaration expired in december , @entity13 resumed command of protest security			1
officers from other agencies have continued to provide backup at larger protests			1
at a candlelight vigil thursday night near the scene of the shooting , religious leaders led prayers for the wounded police officers and protesters			1
dozens of demonstrators gathered again outside the police headquarters thursday night			1
this time , @entity81 of the @entity10 @entity82 said , the security situation on the streets is different			1
" it 's a very tense situation , as you can well imagine , " he told @entity7 's " @entity85			2
" " in my communications as a union official with police commanders , i 've been assured that tactics will be different tonight			2
i assume that means not only more officers , but a wider perimeter , with coverage , perhaps , of these blind spots from which the shots were fired last night			0
" shots rang from a hill overlooking the station out shortly after midnight wednesday , at the end of a protest against the @entity101			2
officers saw " muzzle flashes ... about 125 yards away , " @entity23 said			0
protesters have disavowed any ties to the shooting , saying the demonstrators believe in nonviolence			0
" as the protest was dying down , someone , somewhere got violent			2
now who they were and what group they were affiliated with , we do n't know , " said @entity111 , a @entity10 alderman			0
" in no way are they representative of the thousands of people ... who have been protesting			0
" @entity23 believes someone targeted the police , who have faced heated criticism for months , for a reason			2
" these police officers were standing there , and they were shot just because they were police officers , " he said			2
that department has been under fire since one of its officers , @entity129 , shot and killed black teen @entity131 in august , and more recently since a scathing @entity132 @entity134 report came out documenting a pattern of racial discrimination			0
police chief @entity137 resigned from his post wednesday			2
while the demonstrators ' focus was @entity5 , neither of the wounded officers works in that @entity10 suburb 's @entity143			1
one is from @entity145 , a city about 13 miles south of @entity5			1
the officer -- a 32 - year - old with seven years ' experience -- was shot at the high point of his cheek , just under his right eye , @entity23 said			0
the other wounded officer was hit in the shoulder and the bullet came out the middle of his back , @entity23 said			0
he is a 41 - year - old from @entity11 who has been in law enforcement for the past 14 years			0
both men were treated and released from @entity10 ' @entity159			0
@entity131 's parents condemned the shooting as " senseless , " saying such violence against law enforcement " will not be tolerated			2
" so did the @entity164 , with a tweet signed with president @entity167 's initials offering prayers for the wounded officers and calling " violence against police ... unacceptable			1
" and @entity132 attorney general @entity171 , who visited @entity5 in the aftermath of @entity131 's shooting and unrest that spurred , decried what happened as a " heinous and cowardly ( and ) repugnant attack			1
" " what happened last night was a pure ambush , " @entity171 said			0
" this was not someone trying to bring healing to @entity5			1
this was a damn punk who was trying to sow discord			0
" @entity186 says police banged on her door in the middle of the night			2
" i opened the door and stood back			0
i look at my chest , there 's a red dot on it , " she said			2
" i have my hands up , start crying			0
i said , ' please , do n't shoot me			0
" @entity186 was one of three people who were questioned for hours by investigators thursday and eventually released			2
but they never saw the shooting and had no idea who opened fire , she said			0
@entity186 thinks police questioned her because she was in a car of people who sped away after the shooting -- not because they had anything to do with it , she said , but because they were scared after hearing gunshots			2
it 's not known what connection , if any , the shooter or shooters had to wednesday night 's protest			1
one irony is that , for some protesters , wednesday was a day to celebrate : they 'd called for @entity137 's resignation for months , and finally it was happening			2
but for others , it was not enough			0
that 's why they congregated in @entity5 , to demand changes like disbanding the city 's entire @entity143 and ousting mayor @entity226			1
some chanted , " racist cops have got to go			0
" others held signs with slogans such as " they do n't really care about us ! " and " black lives matter			0
" " it was a great group ( with ) great , great energy , " protester @entity235 said			0
three were arrested in a crowd @entity23 characterized as agitated and " pretty rowdy " at times			0
demonstrator @entity239 told @entity7 that one fight that occurred had nothing to do with the protests			2
at its peak , some 150 protesters congregated wednesday night in front of the @entity5 police station , @entity23 said			1
about 70 law enforcement officers from multiple departments came in to stand in front of the station , as they have on many other nights -- with the turnout of demonstrators the highest since the november grand jury decision not to indict @entity129			0
there 's the manhunt , of course			0
and then there 's the likelihood of more protests and the possibility of more violence as well			1
even though @entity137 , city manager @entity265 , @entity5 's top court clerk and two police officers are gone or on their way out , some activists are vowing to keep pressing for change			1
" we are n't satisfied with this , " @entity269 said of the police chief 's exit			1
" it 's a step in the right direction , but it 's not what total justice looks like in @entity5			1
" @entity137 expressed optimism that , in his view , the @entity134 report concluded that @entity5 " can do the tough work to see this through and emerge the best small town it can be			1
" but what are the prospects after thursday 's shooting ? @entity235 worried that the shooting will undercut the protesters ' message against discrimination and violence			0
" it 's a shame that somebody had to take advantage of this great group , " he said , " to do something so despicable			0
" and @entity23 said it underscores the fact that , eight months after @entity131 's death , the streets of @entity5 are still simmering and law enforcement officers there are on edge			1
" this is beginning at times to be very difficult for any law enforcement agencies , anywhere , to really wrap their arms around , " he said			0
" i want everybody ... to understand how difficult this is			0
" @entity7 's @entity311 , @entity312 , @entity313 , @entity314 , @entity315 , @entity316 , @entity317 and @entity318 contributed to this report .			0
