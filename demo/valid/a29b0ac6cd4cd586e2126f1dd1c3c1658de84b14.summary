why is this @entity1 different than other passovers ? because you may not have any gefilte fish at your table on @entity1 , which starts at sundown on april 3			1
february 's record cold temperatures are to blame for the shortage of fish ingredients , reported @entity10 , a food writer at @entity11 , the @entity12 , @entity13 , newspaper			1
" the traditional @entity1 appetizer is made from ground whitefish , carp and yellow pike , " @entity15 wrote			1
" all three are freshwater fish from the @entity22 , and all three are in short supply this spring because the @entity25 are still covered with ice			1
" while some restaurants reported having no supply issues , it may be a different story for the home cook			2
there 's great debate within the @entity35 community about the flavor of the classic gefilte fish dish , which is n't always the tastiest food at the table			1
" i 've never seen what all the fuss is about , " @entity15 told @entity0			0
" it 's about as challenging a taste as tuna fish salad			2
" the fishing boats just ca n't sail or fish on frozen lakes			0

" nobody 's getting their fishing boats out , " @entity49 said			0

blame an early @entity1 this year			1
next year , it will likely be better for fishing			0
@entity1 does n't start until sunset on april 22 , much later in the month			2
the fish dish is not a religious requirement of the @entity69 dinner , but do n't try telling that to cooks searching for the right ingredients for their classic recipes			0
if your mother or other host is mourning not having the dish at the table this year , offer to make chicken @entity79 or another offering from @entity83 's list of @entity1 recipes from around the world .			1
