@entity0 may be growing less hateful			2
that 's according to an annual @entity4 report that says the number of hate groups in the @entity0 remains on the decline for the second year in a row			1
in the " @entity9 " released tuesday , the @entity4 says the number of hate groups operating in the @entity0 declined 17 % between 2013 and 2014			1
they are now at their lowest levels since 2005 , the watchdog organization said			0
" @entity14 groups , which are animated by a series of conspiracy theories about the alleged evils of the federal government , fell even faster , to 874 groups from a 2012 peak of 1,360 groups			0
in just the last year , the number of @entity14 groups declined by 20 % , from 1,096 groups to 874 , " the report said			1
" but those numbers may be somewhat deceiving			0
more than half of the decline in hate groups was of @entity30 chapters , and many of those have apparently gone underground , ending public communications , rather than disbanding			1
" the decline may be due to a number of factors , including the rebounding economy , law enforcement action and leadership issues within the groups , the @entity4 said			2
the " high social " cost of being associated publicly with a hate group is also noted as a factor for decline , the group said			0
" the atmosphere has changed , " @entity46 , editor - in - chief of the " @entity9 , " told reporters on a conference call			0
" overall , the groups are less important			0
" people publishing messages of hate directly to the @entity54 is also cited as a possible reason for the decline in the organized groups			2
@entity58 and @entity59 have the largest number of hate groups , with more than 50 each			1
@entity62 and @entity63 are the only states with no hate groups , according to the @entity4			1
the report tracks the number of chapters or groups , not individual members , so while the number of groups is on the decline , it 's possible that some of the groups that remain have increased membership			1
the @entity30 experienced the largest decline of all hate groups , according to the report , losing more than 50 % of its chapters			1
one of the oldest and most infamous hate groups in the @entity0 , the @entity30 took its foothold after the @entity84 , terrorizing the @entity86 - @entity86 population with intimidation and violent actions , including lynching			1
the @entity30 's growth slowed after the establishment of @entity93 laws in the @entity94 , according to the @entity4			2
the @entity30 's last resurgence came during the civil rights movement of the 1960s			2
the group was again responsible for large - scale terror against the @entity94 's @entity86 population			0
in 1990 , the @entity4 started to keep track of the number of @entity30 chapters , which reached a high of 221 in 2010 , in response to president @entity106 's election , according to the report			1
since then , the numbers have been on the decline			0
the @entity4 now reports 72 chapters , down from 163 a year ago			1
under @entity106 , 4 in 10 say race relations worsened the reason for the decline of the @entity30 is not totally clear , though the report even suggests the groups may be going deeper underground			1
" it appears that most of the groups simply faded as their leaders and members got older , but it is also very possible that many simply stopped announcing where their chapters were , " the report said			2
the center estimates that between 5,000 and 8,000 people are klan members in the @entity0			0
opinion : @entity0 facing @entity128 bigotry the @entity4 report also notes that more people may be operating as so - called lone wolves			2
the overall number of hate groups peaked in 2011 and has been on the decline since			1
however , the number of registered users to @entity137 -- a website claiming to be " the voice of the new , embattled @entity141 minority ! " -- has doubled since 2008			0
it now has nearly 300,000 users			0
lone wolves are a concern , the report said , because 90 % of all domestic terror attacks since 2009 were carried out by individuals or pairs			0
lone wolf planned attack on @entity153 , @entity150 says the report points to @entity155 , who allegedly killed three people in @entity157 who he thought were @entity158 , and an incident in @entity160 , where an anti-government couple killed two police officers before being killed themselves , as examples of radical criminal elements acting alone			0
the @entity4 refers to this and other indicators to say that many individuals may be moving from organized groups to the @entity54 , to become more anonymous			0
looking towards next year , @entity4 is " expecting a real wave of @entity171 " because of the proliferation of @entity173 and the heavy media coverage of the extremist group , @entity46 told reporters .			1

media coverage of @entity173 could spur " real wave of @entity171 , " report 's editor says
the number of hate groups across the @entity0 dropped 17 % from 2013 to 2014 , the report says
in particular , the number of @entity30 chapters dropped from 163 to 72 in a year , it says
