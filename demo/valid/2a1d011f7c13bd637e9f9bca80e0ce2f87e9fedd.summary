the @entity3 aircraft that crashed earlier this week was deliberately brought down by a co-pilot who had managed to lock himself in the cockpit as he set the plane on a course for destruction , according to officials			1
we all wish it were n't so , and the investigation , instead of looking at possible deficiencies of the plane , will now look to the co-pilot , who -- by all accounts -- showed no signs that this would be his horrific legacy			1
the irony would be rich , if it were n't so tragic			2
the locked door , the very mechanism put into place to protect the cockpit from unruly or dangerous passengers -- made more secure in response to the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks -- was used against a pilot who , for reasons still unknown , left the cockpit			1
it may be too early to draw conclusive lessons from what has happened , but as this unfolds and before we begin constructing a narrative about the pilot that may be filled with rumors , innuendo and half - truths , there are structural issues to address immediately			1
first , we have seen that there is a real risk of pilots bringing down planes			1
we have built no back - up plans into the secure cockpit programs			1
it might be necessary to devise secure and classified entry access passwords or electronic keys that are available only to both pilots or a pilot and the lead flight attendant			1
no system of security should rely on a single point of entry and while the post- 9/11 security planning made sense then , it may have outlived the threat now			1
second , regardless of pilots ' backgrounds and ideologies , airlines as sophisticated as @entity59 may need to implement more than voluntary stress - relief assessments			1
the zeitgeist of pilots is very similar to the military : tough , strong , with psychological challenges viewed as " sissy			2
" perhaps airlines will need to guarantee that pilots who seek counseling will not be unjustly punished			1
and instead of sitting back and waiting for someone to approach counselors , regular and consistent check - ins might be necessary			2
finally , the " t " word			0
before the news today , the @entity75 administration quickly rejected a notion that this was terrorism			0
and that may still be accurate			0
but as someone who has been a part of counterterrorism efforts , i am impressed with the @entity85 prosecutor 's honesty in a search for the right words			0
this is obviously terrorism in the general sense to elicit fear in a general population , but whether it was done for some political or ideological reason ( in the absence of any group taking credit , it does not fit the model of most major airline terror attacks ) we still do not know			2
and it is n't as if there is a national response that we can expect from @entity104 , such as going to war			0
still , it clearly is n't just suicide			0
if there is some nefarious ideological motivation , this may be one of a few incidents where a " loner " is able to create massive , simultaneous deaths			0
most lone wolf terror is almost always of low consequence			2
it may be that we are in an era when we do n't have the right words to describe the threats we face from loners with the capacity for mass casualties			0
as @entity59 ceo @entity125 said , " if a person kills himself and also 149 other people , another word should be used -- not suicide			0
" and that honest assessment is what we heard today .			0

@entity133 : now we know co-pilot brought down @entity3 plane ; this shows need for structural changes to post 9 - 11 security
she says airlines must devise new ways to allow secure access to cockpits ; better evaluate *mindset* of pilots ; *rethink* what is " terror "
