@entity0 the search is on for @entity4 's teen top guns			1
@entity4 said monday it has selected 16 high schools to offer pilot training as the country 's armed forces seek to attract better qualified recruits			1
the schools , in 11 provinces across the country , will recruit 1,000 male junior high school students aged between 14 to 16 , the @entity10 reported			1
successful applicants will receive flight training and " military standard " physical training in addition to their regular high - school studies			2
it 's the latest attempt by the @entity23 's air force to attract more talent			1
last year , it said it would require wannabe pilots to take psychological assessments and a flight simulation test			0
@entity4 's military has traditionally been focused on winning land battles and is now making efforts to improve its air and naval power in the pursuit of what president @entity35 has called " balanced strength			2
" " @entity4 has made many strides in the development of advanced aircraft , but it must make sure there can be sufficient , well - trained pilots to fly them , " @entity38 , deputy editor - in - chief of @entity39 told the @entity10 last month			0
the recruits will receive a stipend and board at the schools			0
traditionally , serving in the military has not been a sought - after career in @entity4 and a @entity52 report on @entity4 's military transformation released last month singled out the quality and professionalism of new recruits as a major challenge			0
many are still drawn from rural areas with limited education , while country 's one - child policy , which has created the " little emperor " phenomenon of spoiled children , produces recruits who " may not be tough enough to withstand military discipline , " the report added			0
to this end , @entity4 has been making efforts to recruit more high school and college graduates as it modernizes its armed forces			1
on completing the three - year program , students will take a pilot selection test , and those who pass will join a @entity23 flight academy and those who fail can choose to enter other military universities or civilian institutes .			0
