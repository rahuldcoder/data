it 's the day the music died			0
in the early morning hours of february 3 , 1959 , a small aircraft carrying @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 " the @entity12 " @entity3 crashed a few miles from @entity9 , near @entity10 , @entity11			1
pilot @entity13 also died in the crash			1
the voice of the hit songs " @entity17 " and " @entity18 " was silenced forever			0
a few months later , the @entity19 blamed the accident primarily on the pilot 's lack of qualification and certification to fly solely by instruments and secondarily on an inadequate weather briefing			2
now , the @entity28 , the successor to the aeronautics board , may be taking another look			0
the @entity28 received a letter from aviation enthusiast @entity33 , a self - described retired pilot and aircraft dispatcher , asking it to look at other possible contributing factors to the crash			1
they include the aircraft 's weight and balance calculations ( for passengers , baggage and fuel ) , possible issues with rudder panels and possible carburetor induction icing , @entity33 told @entity1 in an email			0
" you have gotten our attention , " the @entity28 wrote in february , saying it would examine the information he provided , @entity33 's email said			0
the @entity28 never fully closes a case , but any petition to re-examine a crash needs to show that there is new information suggesting the original probable cause is incorrect , @entity28 spokesman @entity55 said			2
the agency has two months to review the petition and decide whether there 's new information that would make it revisit the case			0
in 1959 , @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity3 were part of the @entity67 , a tour that had started in @entity68 and traveled to small cities in @entity70 and @entity11			1
the musicians had traveled in subfreezing temperatures in unheated buses , and people were getting sick			0
@entity5 booked the four - seat aircraft to fly to @entity76 , where he planned to finally do laundry and rest in advance of the group 's next concert in nearby @entity83 , @entity70			1
country legend @entity85 , then @entity5 's bass player , gave up his seat to a sick @entity3			1
@entity85 , who died in 2002 at age 64 , was haunted by his decision for years to come			0
@entity89 were also on the tour , but @entity91 gave up his seat on the plane after hearing the $ 36 per - person price tag			2
he was the only headliner not on the plane and the only headliner who did n't die that night			2
fans remember ' the @entity67 ' the crash has inspired generations of artists			0
@entity103 played @entity6 ( originally @entity104 ) in the 1987 hit movie " @entity106			1
" @entity107 played @entity5 in the 1978 movie " the @entity109			1
" @entity110 , who was inspired by @entity5 's music , memorialized that day as " @entity67 " in his 1971 song " @entity113			2
