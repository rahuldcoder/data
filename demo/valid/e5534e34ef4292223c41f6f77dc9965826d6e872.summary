a 17 - year - old male fatally shot an @entity5 man watching his first snowfall in his new @entity8 hometown , targeting him and then continuing to fire as the immigrant rushed to get inside , @entity1 police said friday			1
authorities do n't believe the suspected shooter knew the victim , @entity13 , @entity15 maj. @entity14 said reporters , nor do they believe he knew @entity13 's ethnicity			1
and they have n't given any indication @entity13 had anything to do with what led the teen to head out armed in the first place -- a purported shooting at his girlfriend 's apartment , if that in fact happened			1
@entity14 said that , while there have nearby shootings that might be tied to gangs , " we ( have been ) unable to substantiate ... whether or not there was an actual shooting at the apartment			2
" what police do believe , based on witness testimony and other evidence , is that the teenager shot and killed @entity13 , for whatever reason			1
" when he saw mr. @entity13 and their family , he targeted them , he shot at them with intent , " @entity14 said of the suspect , who is under arrest			1
" and as mr. @entity13 ran back toward his apartment , he tracked him with his rifle and continued to fire			1
" @entity1 police named the suspected shooter , though @entity3 is not identifying him yet since he 's a minor and it 's not clear if he 'll be charged as an adult			1
the teen turns 18 in may , police said			2
until the fatal shots ended @entity60 's life , march 4 had been a day of fun and joy for @entity13 and his family			1
the 36 - year - old , who had immigrated to the @entity8 20 days earlier , joined his brother and wife taking pictures in the parking lot of a @entity1 apartment complex amid the snow			1
" just like all of us , a pretty snowfall brings the child out in us , " @entity14 said			0
then came the gunshots and @entity13 's cry , " i 'm hit ! " a few hours later , the @entity5 immigrant was dead			2
three days later , a @entity1 detective found surveillance footage from a nearby elementary school showing four people coming from the apartment complex			0
the black - and - white soundless surveillance video shows one person apparently carrying a rifle is seen running just ahead of a second person seemingly carrying a hand gun , @entity1 police officer @entity82 said			0
approximately 13 seconds later , another person comes into view and passes by the camera , followed by a fourth individual who is walking , she said			0
then , on tuesday , a witness walked into the @entity95 , @entity94 , police station and provided a nickname of a possible suspect -- @entity98			0
that nickname eventually led to the 17 - year - old police believe shot @entity13			1
investigators interviewed him for the first time thursday , at which time he denied ever leaving his girlfriend 's apartment			1
then , authorities got the ok to search his apartment and found an unfired rifle cartridge , @entity14 said			0
the teen was brought to @entity1 police headquarters for another interview , and he changed his story			0
yes , he had been at the scene of @entity13 's killing			2
but no , he had n't done it			0
yet that 's not what someone who 'd been with him said			2
according to @entity14 , this witness said he saw @entity13 taking pictures in the snow , " the witness stated that he observed ( the suspect ) raise the rifle , " the police major said			1
" ... the witness then heard one shot , followed by several more			0
" then all of them bolted			0
the incident caused waves in @entity1 ' @entity133 community			0
while police have n't given any indication this was a hate crime , though @entity137 -- executive director of the @entity138 in the @entity1 and @entity140 area -- noted " a heightened sense of awareness with regard to hate crimes against @entity133			2
" speaking friday on behalf of @entity13 's family , @entity145 expressed gratitude to police and others for their work on the case and said " our community has been at a loss for words and very saddened by this tragic death			1
" " we just want to see justice happen here , " she said			0
" and this is the first step in that			0
" @entity3 's @entity162 and @entity163 contributed to this report .			0

@entity166 , who 'd come from @entity167 weeks earlier , was shot while outside watching snow
police : suspected shooter went out angry thinking someone shot his girlfriend 's apartment
there 's no indication @entity13 had anything to do with that or knew the suspected shooter
