@entity0 as @entity5 @entity3 fighter jets and bombers carry out airstrikes against @entity8 in @entity9 and @entity10 , @entity3 officials are waging a campaign of their own on @entity12			1
the target : sequestration cuts expected to take effect in 2016 that , officials say , will threaten @entity5 air superiority			0
air force secretary @entity18 told lawmakers last month that " enough is enough " when it comes to downsizing the @entity3 , defending president @entity24 's $ 534 billion @entity23 base budget request to the defense appropriations subcommittee			1
" given the state of the world ... the no. 1 thing we have to stop is this downsizing , " @entity26 said			0
despite the concerns of defense officials , lawmakers insisted that $ 10 billion will need to be cut from the @entity3 's portion of the president 's proposed budget , which , in total , exceeds spending caps by nearly $ 35 billion			1
rep. @entity39 , @entity40 , called the president 's base budget " a fantasy " but expressed a desire to find a bipartisan compromise to provide some relief from spending caps instituted in 2013 after budget disagreements between president @entity24 and @entity48			1
until a compromise is reached , @entity39 said the committee will have to make " a lot of tough decisions " related to cutting billions from the @entity3 's spending request			1
but will cuts actually threaten the @entity5 ' standing as the most modern and capable air fleet on the planet ? despite writing the blueprint on how to build the world 's greatest air force , gen. @entity59 , the @entity3 's chief of staff , says the @entity5 will not be able to maintain the @entity3 's strategic gains once next year 's sequestration cuts take effect			1
he says other nations are now using the @entity5 model to build their own air fleets , a trend that could degrade the strategic advantage @entity5 air superiority provides to the military			0
however , some experts say that downsizing the @entity3 and even cutting its budget wo n't necessarily threaten @entity5 air dominance			2
@entity76 , the director of the defense strategies and assessments program at the @entity79 and a former @entity81 captain , says the @entity5 is still comfortably ahead of every other nation in terms of overall air capabilities			0
despite the fact that the @entity3 has a quarter of the number of fighter squadrons it did 25 years ago , it is still larger than the air forces of the next seven countries combined , said @entity76			2
it is also the only nation with an operational fifth - generation fighter jet			0
@entity3 officials argue that the force is currently older and smaller than it has ever been and that further budget cuts would hinder its ability to modernize and maintain effective command structure			1
" the option of not modernizing is n't really an option at all , " @entity59 said			0
" @entity3 forces that fall behind the technology curve and joint forces without the full breadth of air , space and cyber power ... will lose			0
" the irony lies in that the @entity3 's emphasis on investing in a fleet solely made up of high - end aircraft may be one of the key factors drawing down the size of the force , says @entity76			1
he agrees that more spending should be shifted toward air and maritime power due to their increasing roles in @entity5 military strategy but says mistakes were made in terms of how the @entity3 has balanced its commitment to maintaining the size of the fleet with its desire to modernize			0
" @entity3 leadership has failed to balance the idea that quantity has a quality of its own , " he said , adding that the @entity3 should still pursue high - end aircraft but should supplement the fleet with older , cheaper aircraft models , like the @entity132 , for low - end operations instead of immediately phasing them out when a new generation is introduced			2
in order for the @entity3 to maintain air superiority , @entity76 says , officials and lawmakers need to start having a real conversation about the best way to mitigate downsizing that also promotes modernization			2
then they need to work out a budget and find a way to work within it .			0
