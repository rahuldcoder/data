it 's outrage time again			0
this time it 's over a " @entity4 " commercial parody that aired over the weekend			1
the subject ( take a deep breath and prepare to be shocked ) : @entity7			1
yes , that barbaric terrorist group was ridiculed in a parody of a @entity11 commercial			0
the original @entity11 ad depicted a father driving his daughter to the airport			0
he then tearfully says goodbye as his daughter heads off to join the @entity16			0
in the " @entity4 " parody , the daughter is played by @entity19 , star of the hugely successful @entity21 film " @entity22			1
" ( good to see @entity23 has gotten over being offended by the mainstreaming of @entity21			0
) as the parody commercial ends , however , it 's revealed that the daughter is not joining the @entity16 , but @entity7			1
we then see a pickup filled with @entity7 fighters drive up as a worried @entity31 comments to his daughter : " you be careful , ok ? " @entity19 replies reassuringly : " @entity31 ! it 's just @entity7			1
" the father then turns to an @entity7 fighter and says , with emotion , " take care of her			1
" in reply , the militant whispers : " @entity41			0
" and ... cue the outrage ! ! @entity43 lit up instantly			1
twitter user @ ematrudo called @entity45 and " snl " " @entity46 ! " and @entity48 of conservative think tank the @entity47 even went as far as to tweet : " @entity7 skit also draws a moral equivalence between @entity7 murderers and the @entity53 ( based on the spoofed commercial ) , that is wrong			1
" some , apparently in the minority if the media coverage is any indication , also praised " snl " : but my favorite tweet was this one : @ kmorrison is 100 % correct			0
the sketch mocked @entity7 and on some level those who would fall for its sales pitch , like , perhaps , the three young @entity66 girls who reportedly headed to join them			1
comically skewering @entity7 is exactly the right thing to do -- it should be done even more			1
in fact , in @entity72 , the @entity73 and even in @entity74 , where @entity7 is slaughtering people , brave @entity71 comedians are ridiculing @entity7 on tv , in @entity79 videos and in cartoons			1
and i can assure you that if @entity7 were to catch these comedians , it would n't just tweet about its outrage , it would kill them			1
so why do these comedians take the chance ? because , they say , it undermines @entity7 , and also , for many , it is cathartic to laugh at the terrorists , as opposed to shivering in fear about them			1
this is the same reason @entity93 featured " @entity96 " in his hit musical comedy , " @entity95 " : it was a way of using comedy as revenge			0
@entity93 saw it as a way to rob @entity102 of his power ( even if posthumously ) by causing audiences to laugh at him			2
what 's more , the " @entity4 " parody makes an important but subtle point			2
on the side of the @entity7 pickup , the @entity109 writing does not state a religious expression			2
rather it says , " i love cats			0
" as someone who worked at " snl " for eight years , i can assure you this was not happenstance , but rather was by design			0
to me , the " i love cats " line shows that " snl " grasps what many on the right refuse to			0
as i heard firsthand when i attended the @entity124 two weeks ago , @entity7 will despicably use any means to recruit people			2
consequently , as ludicrous as it may seem , saying " we love cats " to young girls is not beyond @entity7			2
when i look at the outrage over this " @entity4 " political parody , i have to wonder : were n't we all " @entity134 suis @entity133 " just a few weeks ago ? remember when we stood firmly with political satirists			2
well , apparently that sentiment ended for some as soon as they saw political satire they did n't like			0
i understand that some will be offended by political comedy with which they do n't agree			0
but in a time when freedom of expression is under attack , if you are offended by political satire on tv , then change the channel .			0

@entity151 : @entity43 blew up over " @entity4 " skit about girl joining @entity7
he says ridiculing and laughing at terrorists undermines them , diminishes their power
