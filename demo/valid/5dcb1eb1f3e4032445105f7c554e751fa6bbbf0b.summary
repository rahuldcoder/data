@entity1 's ruling @entity0 pulled off a victory in tuesday 's election -- and it was a stunning one			1
during the campaign , incumbent prime minister @entity6 had come in for heavy criticism from across the political spectrum , for reasons ranging from concerns over his frosty relationship with the @entity13 , to his fixation on the @entity16 nuclear issue , to allegations over @entity6 's household expenses			1
yet despite this unpromising backdrop , @entity0 is on course to win 30 seats in the @entity22 , six seats more than the main opposition @entity25 -- headed by @entity26 and @entity27 , and an obvious favorite of the @entity1 media establishment and @entity30 , @entity31 , and the @entity32			2
the blow to the @entity25 is particularly painful because some opinion polls had actually had the party leading @entity0 as the campaign drew to a close			0
( @entity0 was n't the only winner of the night -- the new center - right party @entity39 ( @entity40 ) , which focuses on the economy , also had a good showing , securing 10 seats )			0
still , @entity0 's resounding has n't settled the eventual makeup of the government -- in the coming weeks , the work of negotiating a coalition will begin			0
with this in mind , there is a good chance that president @entity53 will ask @entity6 to form a national unity government , either with the @entity25 , or as the head of a right - wing coalition ( although the bitter rivalry between @entity26 / @entity27 and @entity6 during the campaign makes the latter more likely )			2
overall , the election results seemed to reflect the rightward shift of the electorate , with even voters who self - identify as centrists consistently expressing conservative positions on both the @entity67 issue and broader questions of national security			1
meanwhile , the numbers for the left in tuesday 's election -- a four seats for @entity74 , 24 for the @entity25 and 14 for the @entity76 list suggests the bloc is some 20 seats short of a viable coalition			1
as a result , the international community and the @entity67 leadership will have to face the reality that negotiations over the @entity67 state will be conducted with the center - right			0
so , what can we expect from the new @entity6 government ? issues that dominated the campaign , namely security and the economy , will likely dominate			2
for a start , @entity6 will try to improve his record on domestic and social issues by introducing more proactive policies tied to housing and land reform			2
the issue of housing requires especially painful economic and bureaucratic changes over the @entity102 and planning and zoning processes			0
but to address these issues properly , @entity6 will have to confront land owners and the housing constructors , meaning key structural reforms are unlikely in the short term			0
in addition , @entity6 will also have to repair the fractured relationship with @entity31 , something that may not be easy given that ties with the @entity115 administration will largely depends on whether a nuclear deal over @entity16 is reached , and what shape such a deal takes			0
that raises the question over what direction the government will take over national security , and on this , the government can probably be expected to pursue the status quo			1
this is despite the fact that growing instability and the proliferation of non-state hostile actors suggests that @entity1 should instead move beyond a short - term approach and toward building a long - term , comprehensive national security strategy that could make it an integrated regional power			1
making such a change would require a political process capable of resolving the @entity1 - @entity67 conflict , rather than merely kicking the can down the road			0
restarting communication with the @entity32 leadership and properly engaging with the @entity142 would be steps in the right direction			0
all that said , this will be @entity6 's fourth term in office , and so there is plenty of evidence with which to judge his likely trajectory			2
and that suggests that he will find it easier to focus on issues tied to the economy than making any real steps forward on building a comprehensive long - tern national security strategy			1
those hoping that the prime minister might rethink his national security policies are likely to be disappointed again .			1
