organized labor is up in arms about president @entity4 's effort to obtain fast - track authority to finalize a free trade agreement in the @entity7 that involves 11 nations			1
the agreement , union leaders argue , threatens to take even more jobs away from @entity12			1
@entity14 president @entity13 sent a clear message to members of @entity17 , warning , " there is such a dramatic impact on the standard of living and lowering of wages and a loss of jobs -- this will have a major impact , and then we will not forget this vote for a long time			1
" the @entity14 announced that it would withhold donations to political action committees until this controversy cleared up			2
the tension between organized labor and @entity4 is not new			1
the struggles have been going on since 2009 when the president allowed the @entity34 to wither in @entity17			1
the act would require that a union be deemed as legitimate when it had the support of a majority of employees and imposed tough penalties on employers who tried to punish workers from forming unions			0
the president avoided making any strong appeals for the bill , though it was greatly desired by labor organizations as a way to increase membership			1
when @entity53 chose @entity54 , @entity55 , for their 2012 political convention -- a city not friendly to labor -- unions were livid			1
" there is broad frustration with the party and all elected officials , " one labor leader said , " broad frustration with the lack of a union agenda			2
" even though unions were crucial to administration victories such as the @entity70 , president @entity4 has often been extremely tepid when it comes to the rights of unions			1
organized labor has not been that surprised			1
the truth is that unions have been on the defense against @entity53 presidents for decades			0
in the 1970s , president @entity79 treated unions like one more special interest in @entity82 that needed to be brought down while president @entity83 demonstrated lukewarm support to these organizations as he aggressively pursued global free trade policies that labor opposed			1
" it will cost jobs , " warned @entity88 democrat @entity87 said of the @entity89 that @entity83 endorsed			2
" it will drive down our standard of living			0
if we do n't stand up for the working people in this country , who is going to ? " in the past few decades , many @entity53 politicians no longer believed that organized labor was a major player within their party , as they had been during the creation of the @entity101 and @entity102			1
as organized labor became a smaller part of the @entity12 workforce , @entity53 politicians were not as determined to court their vote			1
a larger number of @entity53 since the 1970s have been elected by upper middle class suburban constituencies in which unions are not a big presence			0
these voters have been more concerned in a style of liberalism that revolves around quality of life issues , such as environmental regulation , than they are with middle class jobs			2
many @entity53 leaders embraced a vision of economic policy that centered on deregulation and free markets			2
new voices that came into the @entity53 after the 1960s wanted to challenge @entity125 by offering a more centrist vision of economic policy			0
the opportunities for @entity53 to embrace a more pro-union agenda have only intensified with the fierce assault taking place among conservatives			0
the @entity134 brothers have unleashed fierce financial assault against unions			0
@entity137 , the governor of @entity138 and potential @entity125 presidential candidate , has stripped away the power of public unions and signed a right to work law that barred unions from collecting dues from employees who were n't in unions			0
unions are under assault , and the movement is looking for help			0
democrats , and some @entity125 , often talk about needing to deal with the problem of economic inequality			0
much of the talk is often vague and offers little in the way to real solutions			0
shoring up the strength of unions is one area where the government can help protect jobs for middle class @entity12			1
without strong unions , the battle against economic inequality and insecurity will never really get started			0
as @entity168 , the president of @entity169 wrote in the @entity170 , " by defunding unions and weakening union members via ' right to work ' laws , corporations and those that do their bidding remove workers ' primary means of raising wages , securing pensions and improving workers conditions			2
workers ' main vehicle for advancing themselves and their communities is jeopardized			0
" @entity53 need to listen to what the @entity14 is saying			0
they need to push back against president @entity4 , even if this creates political opportunities for @entity125 , so that the party does not abandon what has been at the heart and soul of their agenda			1
as @entity53 continually watch @entity125 outdo them in terms of organization and pursuit , they need to look to labor more as an ally than an enemy in the battle for the @entity200 and @entity17 in the coming years .			2

president @entity4 wants to obtain fast - track authority to finalize a free trade agreement in the @entity7
@entity205 : organized labor is right to worry that this would take away more jobs from @entity12
