after a handful events in two months , @entity0 has filled her march with a mix of women 's events , nonprofit speeches and at least one paid appearance			1
in january and february , @entity8 headlined three events -- only one of which was in the @entity12			1
but as @entity8 moves closer to her expected 2016 presidential campaign announcement , the former secretary or state has at least seven events scheduled for the month of march			1
most of @entity8 's events are focused on one thing : women			1
@entity8 starts her month by headlining the 30th anniversary gala for @entity23 -- a @entity25 organization that focused on helping @entity27 women win elected office			1
at the @entity30 speech on march 3 , @entity8 is expected to give a nod to the group 's importance to @entity27 and highlight the reason more women are needed in politics			1
@entity23 has been energized by @entity8 's campaign and has pledged to raise and spend more money than any other election cycle because of the prospect of a @entity41			2
the following week , @entity8 will headline two @entity43 events tied to her 1995 speech to the @entity46 in @entity47 -- a speech @entity8 regularly references in pitches to women			1
in that speech @entity8 said , " if there is one message that echoes forth from this conference , let it be that human rights are women 's rights and women 's rights are human rights once and for all			1
" on march 9 , @entity8 teams up with @entity60 , her daughter , and @entity63 to release a report through the @entity66 that looks at " the gaps that still remain " in women 's participation in the economy and politics			1
the following day -- on march 10 -- @entity8 will headline the @entity74 's @entity73 annual gathering in @entity43			1
@entity8 will use the speech to outline the findings in the @entity66 report and " reflect on progress made in implementing the agenda set in @entity47 two decades ago , " the organizers said in a release about the event			1
on march 16 , @entity8 will be inducted into the @entity82 at an event in @entity43			2
@entity8 is not @entity84 -- her family is of @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , and @entity91 descent -- but she is being honored because of " her dedicated work on @entity94			2
" " @entity0 is one of the unsung heroes of the success of the @entity84 peace process , " said @entity82 co-founder @entity95			0
in 1998 , @entity8 put together the @entity99 of women in @entity101 , a body that pressed for a piece agreement			2
the former secretary of state cited her experiences in @entity106 during a number of speeches in 2014			0
@entity95 is a longtime @entity8 supporter , though , and was a member of her 2008 campaign finance team			2
some republicans have questioned how active @entity8 was in the @entity106 peace process			0
the @entity114 wrote in 2008 that @entity8 " seems to be overstating her significance as a catalyst in the @entity106 peace process , which was more symbolic than substantive , " but that she did play " a helpful role at the margins			0
" on march 19 , @entity8 will headline her only confirmed paid speech of the month when she heads to @entity124 for the @entity125 , @entity43 & @entity126			1
@entity127 , the group 's executive director , tells @entity2 , " yes , just like most nonprofits and conferences , she is being paid for her appearance			0
" but she would not confirm how much she is being paid			0
on average , @entity8 makes between $ 200,000 and $ 300,000 per speech			2
near the end of the month , on march 23 in @entity30 , @entity8 will be the keynote speaker at the award celebration for the @entity136 in @entity137 from @entity138			2
@entity139 , who graduated from @entity138 , was the first woman national political correspondent for the @entity140			0
@entity138 @entity141 said @entity8 is a " vivid example — like @entity139 — of a pioneering woman at the top of her profession			0
" @entity8 headlining an event honoring political journalists is somewhat unique because for decades she has held a dim view of the profession			0
in a 1996 , according to the diary of the late @entity8 confidant @entity152 , @entity8 said the media are " complete hypocrites			0
" at an event in 2014 , @entity8 said " journalism has changed quite a bit in a way that is not good for the country and not good for journalism			0
" " a lot of serious news reporting has become more entertainment driven and more opinion - driven as opposed to factual , " she said			0
" people book onto the shows , political figures , commentators who will be controversial who will be provocative because it 's a good show			0
you might not learn anything but you might be entertained and i think that 's just become an unfortunate pattern that i wish could be broken			0
" @entity8 's presidential campaign has become a forgone conclusion and @entity27 close to @entity8 expect she will announce some official move towards the presidency in april .			1

@entity8 currently has seven events in march , with one paid speech and many focused on women
this comes after @entity8 gave only three speeches in january and february
