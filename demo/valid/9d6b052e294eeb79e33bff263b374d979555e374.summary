every time a snowstorm bears down on @entity2 , @entity3 -- which has happened a lot this winter -- students and parents turn to @entity7 to find out whether schools will be closed			1
they rarely get a straight answer			2
instead , @entity2 residents see jokes , meme - filled videos and teasing references to snow days at fictional high schools from " @entity17 " or " @entity18 " -- all courtesy of mayor @entity2 , a social - media prankster whose @ @entity23 account provides actual updates about school closings amid all the buffoonery			1
" attention : @entity28 is closed for tomorrow			0
# 90210 , " read one recent mayoral tweet			0
@entity30 always gets around to the real news eventually			0
but first come the wisecracks			0
he was in especially rare form tuesday night , tweeting almost a dozen snow - day jokes , @entity37 user and freelance journalist @entity38 chronicled , as yet another storm hit @entity2			1
parents and students tuning in for real news about snow days might find this running gag irritating			1
but on @entity7 , at least , many students seem to get the joke			1
" @ @entity49 you better get each and every one of us a therapist after all of stress you 're causing us , " wrote one			0
" the kids take it tongue in cheek			2
they understand , because it 's sort of a tradition around here , " said @entity30 , who told @entity0 he 's been trading jokes about snow days with students on @entity7 for several years now			1
" we go back and forth			0
but it 's all in good fun			0
" one twist of the whole thing is that @entity30 does n't even make the call about closing @entity2 schools			1
that decision is left to superintendent of schools @entity70 , who confers with @entity30 by phone and then sends an automated update to every parent 's phone			0
but @entity30 , who ran for governor of @entity3 last year and has 18,000 @entity7 followers , usually posts his school - closing tweets first			1
finally , after hours of build - up , the mayor gave people of @entity2 the news at 6:21 a.m. wednesday : schools would open two hours late			1
the mayor says he wants to help young people engage with public servants -- and show them that he can be funny			2
" i have a very serious policy side ... but i like to have a good chuckle , " he said			0
" that 's who i am			0
in the end , i think it ( social media ) is about being yourself			0
" he says he rarely gets complaints about his @entity7 feed , and that " parents think it 's hysterical			2
" but maybe not all @entity2 parents			2
" as a parent , has it been helpful ? no , " said @entity103 , whose 6 - year - old son attends a @entity2 magnet school			1
" because as a parent i do n't have time for @entity7			2
