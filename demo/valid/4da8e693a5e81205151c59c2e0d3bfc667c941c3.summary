it 's a controversial question that 's sparked debate since officials revealed the identity of the masked man known as @entity6			1
was @entity7 , the man with a @entity9 accent who 's appeared in numerous @entity10 beheading videos , pushed toward extremism by authorities ? or was he someone who 'd long been heading down a militant path ? a @entity17 - based advocacy group that worked with @entity7 says emails he sent them paint a picture of a desperate man hounded by authorities who saw his plans for a new life crumble as he tried unsuccessfully to get help			1
and a report from the @entity28 , also citing emails purportedly sent from @entity30 to the @entity9 publication , said the @entity32 - born @entity17 saw himself as a " dead man walking " and contemplated suicide because of his alleged harassment by authorities			1
but some analysts say the emails are only part of the story , arguing that investigators targeted @entity30 because they already saw he had links with terrorist groups			2
" you ca n't start the story at how he 's been treated by @entity9 officials			1
you certainly ca n't start the story from the email trail , " said @entity47 , director at the counterextremism consultancy @entity48 and a fellow of the @entity51			1
" you have to go back to why the intelligence services got in contact with him			0
well , because he was part of a group of a people who were going to join @entity60 -- a very extremist organization and jihadist group that got involved in horrific terrorist attacks in @entity63			1
" @entity7 felt he was being harassed by authorities and tried to seek legal help to stop it , according to @entity66 , the human rights and @entity69 advocacy organization that worked with him			1
one email details @entity7 's account of his detention at a @entity9 airport , when authorities stopped him from traveling to @entity32 in 2010 and questioned him for hours			1
" i told them that i want to be left alone , as i have an ambition of moving from the @entity9 and settling in @entity32			2
that is why i found a job and a spouse ! ! but they laughed , " @entity7 wrote in a message dated june 3 , 2010			2
" one of them got aggressive with me , he pushed me to the wall			0
... i was just baffled i did not know why he had done that after this long 6hour interview , fingerprinting and searching			0
when i asked for their names they said ' we do n't give out our names			1
' " @entity7 wrote that the way he was treated by @entity9 security and intelligence officials reminded him " of criminals that you see on tv who have committed a serious crime , only i was a person never charged or arrested for anything			1
i was a person looking to start a new life in my country @entity32 ! " that 's a key detail , @entity66 spokesman @entity104 said			2
" if someone is going to carry out some violent attack in any kind of way , then the law is there to be in force and apprehend them , " he said			0
" in the @entity9 , he was n't arrested once , prosecuted or cautioned whatsoever			1
" @entity9 authorities have not responded to @entity1 's requests for comment on the case			1
in the emails , @entity7 pleaded for @entity66 's help			1
" please help me as i do n't want to stay in the @entity9 because i have found a job in @entity32 , found a spouse in @entity32 and thus found a new start for my life in @entity32			1
@entity32 is where i 'm from , i was born their			0
i just want to go their and start my new life again ! ! " @entity7 wrote that he had also made a formal complaint at the @entity128 , before going into detail about how he was apparently " assaulted by the police officer " as he attempted to leave for @entity32			1
but it was a difficult complaint to prove , @entity131 said			0
" the @entity128 says there 's no camera in the room where this took place , so we ca n't really do much about it except put a black mark against the officer , " he said			2
" these things happen in the shadows and the dark			0
so it is very difficult to independently verify once it 's taken place			0
there is n't much of an opportunity to gain redress and accountability			0
" details from court papers reported in @entity9 media paint a different picture			1
they say @entity7 was part of a group of extremists sometimes called the " @entity159 " who allegedly funneled money and recruits to @entity60			1
the @entity163 has reported that @entity7 was part of a terror cell with links to the failed @entity17 bomb attacks in 2005			2
to @entity9 authorities , his face was a familiar one for more than five years			2
but authorities lost track of him in 2013 , according to friends			0
he changed his name and made his way to @entity174			0
analysts who 've studied @entity10 recruiting say they are n't buying the argument that harassment from authorities turned @entity7 into " @entity6			1
" " i think it 's an absurd claim , " said @entity179 , director of the @entity180 for the @entity181			2
" it was not the cause of his radicalization			0
the reason the intelligence services harassed him was because they suspected him of trying to join the @entity60 in @entity63			0
" @entity47 argued that abuse at the hands of officials is not an excuse for terrorism			1
" people do not turn around , when harassed and have grievances , and become terrorists , " he said			0
in addition to the emails released by @entity66 , another series of emails from @entity30 came to light over the weekend			0
the messages were sent in 2010 and 2011 to the @entity28 's security editor , @entity202			2
the @entity28 published excerpts from those exchanges , including @entity7 's description of an incident where he tried to sell his laptop through a website , but only stated his surname			1
when he met a potential buyer at a @entity17 underground station , he says the person he met shook his hand and said " nice doing business with you @entity7			2
" " @entity216 ! ! " wrote @entity7 to @entity202			2
" & i never give out my first name ! ! it was impossible for him to know my first name ! ! " he also hinted at suicidal thoughts			0
" sometimes i feel like im a dead man walking , not fearing they may kill me			0
" rather , fearing that one day , i 'll take as many pills as i can so that i can sleep for ever ! ! i just want to get away from these people ! ! ! " @entity202 said he met @entity226 in 2010 when he was investigating his claims of being harassed by police and intelligence			0
@entity7 's concerns bordered on paranoia , @entity202 wrote , and he desperately wanted his story to be told			1
" like many young @entity69 men at the time , he appeared to have a grievance			0
but this man was different , " @entity202 wrote			0
" in him was a warped sense of injustice that could never justify the barbaric acts of murder that he has gone on to carry out in @entity174			0
" @entity1 's @entity241 and @entity242 contributed to this report .			0
