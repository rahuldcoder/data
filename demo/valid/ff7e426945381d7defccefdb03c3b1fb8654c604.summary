in 1971 , a physicist conceptualized the existence of a fourth fundamental element in the electronic circuit , besides the three that were already in use at the time			2
his name was @entity9 and he believed -- for reasons of symmetry -- that an extra component could one day be constructed to join the resistor , the capacitor and the inductor			2
he called it " memristor " , a portmanteau of the words memory and resistor			2
it took 37 years for our engineering abilities to catch up with that idea : the first memristor was built by @entity26 in 2008			1
and today , many researchers believe it could spark a revolution in computing			1
simply put , the memristor could mean the end of electronics as we know it and the beginning of a new era called " ionics "			1
the transistor , developed in 1947 , is the main component of computer chips			1
it functions using a flow of electrons , whereas the memristor couples the electrons with ions , or electrically charged atoms			0
in a transistor , once the flow of electrons is interrupted by , say , cutting the power , all information is lost			0
but a memristor can remember the amount of charge that was flowing through it , and much like a memory stick it will retain the data even when the power is turned off			0
this can pave the way for computers that will instantly turn on and off like a light bulb and never lose data : the @entity64 , or memory , will no longer be erased when the machine is turned off , without the need to save anything to hard drives as with current technology			0
but memristors have another fundamental difference compared with transistors : they can escape the boundaries of binary code			0
initially , the technology will be mostly used to create super-fast memory chips that contain more data and consume less energy			0
this alone would make regular computers much more powerful , but down the line , the memristor could also take on the processing			1
@entity84 is a professor of electrochemical materials at @entity86 , and she 's working with @entity87 to build a memristor - based machine			1
@entity89 , she points out , function in a way that is similar to a human brain : " unlike a transistor , which is based on binary codes , a memristor can have multi-levels			1
you could have several states , let 's say zero , one half , one quarter , one third , and so on , and that gives us a very powerful new perspective on how our computers may develop in the future , " she told @entity1 's @entity97			1
such a shift in computing methodology would allow us to create " smart " computers that operate in a way reminiscent of the synapses in our brains			2
free from the limitations of the 0s and 1s , these more powerful computers would be able to learn and make decisions , ultimately getting us one step closer to creating human - like artificial intelligence			2
transistors are based on silicon , a rigid material whose properties are used to manage the flow of electrons , and thus information			2
in 1975 , @entity129 , the co-founder of @entity130 , formulated a famous law which states that the number of transistors in an electronic circuit doubles approximately every two years			0
this has so far proven accurate and set the pace for the constant increase in computing power , but the trend might soon come to an end			0
there is a physical limit to the number of transistors that we can pack on a chip , and we are already approaching the miniaturization threshold of this technology			0
it is inevitable that , one day , we will need to move away from silicon based computing			1
the memristor technology is a candidate for this crucial step : " it could mean the end of the silicon era , giving us lower power consumption , the ability to compute more information , increased data storage and completely new logic patterns for our computers , " says @entity84			1
memristors do n't require a silicon layer and different materials can be used as a substrate			1
this could create a new class of microchips , that could eventually be integrated in everyday items such as windows , clothes or even coffee cups			1
after manufacturing the first ever memristor , @entity26 has been working for years on a new type of computer based on the technology			1
according to plans , it will launch by 2020			0
simply called " @entity178 " , it uses " electrons for processing , photons for communication , and ions for storage			0
" " i think there is a race going on , " says @entity84			0
" there is a strong driving force , but at the same time it 's very important that there are players like @entity26 , because they want to get to the market , show everyone that this is real			0
" at the moment , manufacturing costs are still high , but the benefits are worth it : " @entity89 operate at a lower power consumption , with a faster speed , and with a higher volume density of information than anything we have based on silicon microchip transistors , " @entity84 told @entity1			1
much like a particle in the realm of physics , the existence of the memristor was theorized long before we could actually build one			2
now that we have that capability to manufacture it , the " missing fourth element " of electronics -- despite its less than catchy name -- might be the key to many further human discoveries			0

the memristor is a new type of electrical component that could revolutionize electronics
it was first conceptualized in the 1970s , long before one could even be built
researchers at @entity86 work with @entity87 in memristors for future computing devices
@entity89 - based chips would n't require silicon , so we could see computers in windows , textiles or even coffee cups
