a ballerina dancing in a music box and a girl sat in an armchair drinking tea surrounded by flowers			0
this is how two of @entity9 's most popular websites chose to celebrate @entity10 sunday , unleashing a storm of criticism , especially on social media , which ridiculed their home page " doodles " as sexist stereotypes			1
" may the world treat you gently , " the video - sharing site @entity18 told its female users			2
search engine @entity22 had no explicit message for its visitors , but the rotating ballerina turned into a bride and then a mom with a stroller			2
internet users were quick to point out how the efforts of @entity22 , @entity9 's biggest search engine , and @entity18 , dubbed @entity9 's @entity32 , contrasted with global rival @entity33			1
its doodle depicted women in several different professions , including a scientist , artist , astronaut , chef , musician , teacher and volleyball player			2
" this is how you define women and celebrate them ! " said @entity46 user @entity47 of @entity22 's music box			1
" @entity33 's doodle just makes their stupidity even worse			0
" @entity54 , a professor at @entity55 in @entity56 , said that the companies ' choice of imagery suggested that women are there only to be taken care of and look pretty -- and the real world of business should be left to men			2
" internet companies conveying such a narrow definition of women is n't good			2
it 's exactly the opposite of the @entity10 mission , which is fighting for gender equality , " he told @entity0			2
@entity22 and @entity18 did n't immediately respond to calls for comment			1
the doodle uproar came as @entity9 authorities detained several women right 's activists this weekend			1
some of them had planned to hold a nationwide protest against sexual harassment			0
on monday , five were still being held police , said an activist and a friend of the women , who asked not to be identified			1
@entity87 traditionally cracks down on activists during important meetings like this week 's @entity90 ( @entity90 )			0
" in other countries , doing such things on @entity10 is natural , while in @entity9 you get detained for fighting for women 's rights , " she said			1
" everything we 've done is mild and done legally -- we call for gender equality in the college entrance exam and more toilet spots for women , " she added			0
under chairman @entity103 , women famously " held up half the sky " but there is a growing sense that @entity9 women today face more , not less , discrimination than in the past			1
the @entity110 reported last month that women make up fewer than one in 10 board members at the country 's top 300 companies			0
and @entity9 's state - run media often appears more concerned with women 's looks and marital status than equal rights			1
showing the same tin ear as @entity22 and @entity18 , the @entity122 , the @entity124 's official newspaper , published an online gallery entitled " beauty with brains			1
" it featured 18 snapshots of female journalists covering the @entity90 in @entity87 this week			0
and during the @entity133 holidays last month , a television gala watched by 690 million people included comedy skits mocking overweight and unmarried women			0
incensed feminists called for an end to the annual televised extravaganza in an online petition			0
just weeks earlier , @entity140 , an influential writer , enraged many when he said that " a man can have thousands of ambitions but a woman only one " -- to give birth			0
@entity54 , the professor , said that more and more women are n't happy with the gender roles @entity9 society ascribes to them , and this year 's string of " sexist incidents " reflects men 's concerns that women are n't as " feminine " as they once were			1
" they hope women will return to the way they 're supposed to be			0
" @entity158 contributed to this report			0
