wildlife services in @entity2 are being pushed to their limits this year			0
since january 2015 , every month has set a record in sea lion " strandings , " mostly sea lion pups , according to the @entity8			1
" there has been an unusually high number of sea lions stranded since january , " said @entity9 , assistant stranding coordinator for @entity8 on the @entity10			1
" stranding does happen , but just to give you perspective , 1,800 [ sea lion ] pups have been responded to this year alone			2
we responded to 1,600 strandings total during the entire year in 2013 , " he said			0
stranding is the official term to describe marine life that " swim or float into shore and become beached or stuck , " according to @entity8			2
strandings are taking a toll on the resources available in coastal counties from @entity31 to @entity32			0
local care facilities have taken in more stranded sea lions this year than 2004 - 12 combined , and it is only mid-march			1
@entity9 said he expects the problem to continue beyond april , when weaning normally occurs , when the pups are 10 or 11 months old			0
@entity38 , director of communications for @entity39 , said @entity40 has rescued nearly 500 sea lions this year			1
" this is a new record for @entity40 , " @entity38 said			0
" in 1983 we rescued 474			0
" some of the sea lions responded to have had to be euthanized			1
" they [ sea lion pups ] have to be able to eat and fish on their own before they can be released back into the wild , and a lot of these pups have n't even been weaned , " @entity9 said			2
@entity9 said @entity2 has had warmer weather than usual this year , and , while @entity8 is still conducting studies on the @entity55 to get a more proven explanation , warmer water drives the food source farther out or deeper into the ocean , where the colder water is			2
when food is farther away , the mothers are away from the pup too long in search of food , and return with little food or too few nutrients for a growing sea lion			1
" we have been seeing emaciated or dehydrated sea lions show up on beaches , " @entity9 said			1
however , he said , the species has made a comeback since the @entity73			0
@entity2 's sea lion population has grown to 300,000 from an estimated population of 10,000 in the 1950s , according to the @entity77 @entity76			0
people who observe stranded sea lions are advised not to touch them or attempt to rescue them , because it can be dangerous and it is illegal			1
instead , call any of the rescue agencies listed on @entity8 @entity85 's website			2
if the animal has died , the local dead animal pickup service should be alerted .			0

" there has been an unusually high number of sea lions stranded since january , " @entity8 *representative* says
the speculation is mothers are having *difficulty* finding food , leaving pups alone too long or *malnourished*
