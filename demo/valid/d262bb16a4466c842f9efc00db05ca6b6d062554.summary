@entity0 is not a self - effacing man			1
that 's why when the @entity6 president suddenly disappeared from view people took notice			1
when @entity6 officials tried to trick the public by passing off old photos as new appearances , speculation about @entity0 's whereabouts went viral			1
hashtags such as # @entity16 and # @entity17 -- @entity6 for # @entity18 -- became the tip of a giant social media iceberg , much of it streaked with dark humor			1
in @entity26 , the neighboring state besieged by @entity0 's forces , someone reportedly left a large funeral wreath at the gate of the @entity6 embassy			1
a handwritten message addressed @entity0 with an expletive , telling him , " thank you for croaking			1
" the fast - moving iceberg of speculation may melt as fast as it emerged			2
the @entity36 has now started pushing harder against the rumors , trying to prove that @entity6 's foremost -- nay , only -- major political leader , is alive and well			1
early on friday , officials released what they said was a picture of @entity0 taken the day of			1
but on social media , onlookers accused officials of dusting off old images			2
those keeping track insist @entity0 has not been seen since march 5			1
regardless of how or when this speculation ends , it tells us much about the political realities of @entity6			1
this whole thing started after @entity0 's trip to @entity54 was canceled on wednesday and a @entity54 official told a reporter that the @entity6 president had fallen ill. then the @entity36 released a picture of @entity0 speaking with the leader of the @entity60			1
but it turns out that happened on march 4			0
on thursday , @entity0 's spokesman , @entity63 , said the president would miss his regular meeting with the @entity66 ( @entity66 )			1
when asked about his boss 's health , @entity63 said he is " absolutely healthy , " his handshake so strong he could " break your hand			2
" to illustrate the point , the @entity36 's @entity72 posted a picture of the mighty president slamming a judo opponent hard against the ground			1
@entity63 says @entity6 is in the grips of a " spring fever " that is causing people to dream up harebrained scenarios			2
amateur sleuths and creative minds have speculated wildly about @entity0 's health problems			1
the @entity87 magazine @entity85 said @entity0 is in @entity88 , where his girlfriend just gave birth to their baby			2
some have said he has cancer ; others report a heart attack or a stroke			0
there are even suggestions that he went off to join @entity100 , or is playing hide - and - seek a la where 's @entity103			0
does @entity0 ever catch a cold ? does he ever get sick ? the @entity36 does n't want to allow @entity0 's image of virility and strength to become tarnished by the weaknesses of mere humans			1
@entity0 is not your average president			1
on paper , @entity6 is a democracy			2
but no objective observer believes that			0
every important decision is made by him			0
@entity0 rules in the old - fashioned style of a personality cult			2
his approval ratings are stratospheric , even if his brazen policies would warrant more significant levels of disagreement			0
approval ratings nearing 90 % are the product of suppression of dissent and media maneuvers demonizing , ridiculing , and ultimately silencing critics			0
the system requires propaganda and image control			0
it needs @entity0 to be larger than life			2
the recent murder of @entity137 , @entity0 's foremost critic , has spawned fears that there is a hit list , a roster of @entity0 critics whose days are numbered			1
there are rampant rumors of intrigue inside the @entity36			0
the level of fear is said to be higher than it has been in years			0
the term " @entity150 " became the study of intrigue and power machinations in inscrutably dark systems			0
@entity6 has a long history of concealing the illnesses of its leaders			2
in the @entity161 era , some mysterious disappearances were followed by funerals			0
in those days , there was usually a succession plan			0
and in the post-stalin days , the passing of one leader meant that the party chose the next strongman			0
in 1991 , the last @entity161 leader , @entity170 , went to his summer home in @entity172			0
he was visited by a group of high - ranking @entity161 officials			0
the next day , the @entity6 people were told that @entity170 was ill , and could not perform his duties			2
@entity170 was held against his will			0
there was a coup in progress			0
@entity0 's mentor , president @entity181 , also had a history of " disappearing " from view			1
he was really ill and / or drunk			0
even if @entity0 is in perfect health and the social media whirlwind turns out to have just been an outlet for creativity , talk of @entity0 's disappearance raises important questions			1
what would @entity6 become if he suddenly left power ? is there a successor in place ? is there anyone who would continue @entity0 's policies ? if there is a power vacuum , a conceivable scenario given just how thoroughly @entity0 dominates , what would the consequences be ? whatever @entity0 is doing at this exact moment -- whether he is hunting tigers , visiting with friends , or convalescing from an illness -- and no matter what he does in the days ahead , the @entity209 tempest of the past few days is a reminder that the man who embodies today 's @entity6 state , who dismantled the country 's once - fledgling democracy , wo n't be around forever			1
which raises the question , what then ?			0
