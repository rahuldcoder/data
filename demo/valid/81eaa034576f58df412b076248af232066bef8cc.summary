@entity2 @entity1 president @entity0 appeared in public monday for the first time in about 10 days as he met with @entity6 president @entity5 in the @entity1 city of @entity8			1
@entity0 is n't generally one to shy away from the limelight -- posing with a ( tranquilized ) tiger , riding a horse while shirtless , earning a karate black belt			2
so his unexplained absence fueled speculation about his health , grip on power and even his love life			0
although the @entity20 and the @entity1 state media released photos and video footage of @entity0 last week , they did not quell the rumors about his whereabouts , because it was unclear when they were taken			1
so all eyes were turned to @entity8 on monday for @entity0 's scheduled meeting with @entity5 of @entity6			1
his appearance before the press , looking healthy and relaxed , should help put some of the rumors at least to rest			0
and he made light of his absence , saying : " it would be boring without gossip			1
" in another sign @entity0 has a firm hand on the tiller , defense minister @entity37 said the president had ordered @entity1 's @entity42 to be placed on full combat alert from monday morning for snap checks , @entity1 's state - run @entity36 news agency reported			1
the checks are intended to test the fleet 's capacity to ensure @entity1 's military security in the @entity49 , @entity36 said			1
also on alert are @entity1 's @entity51 and certain airborne units , with some 38,000 military personnel involved in total			1
here 's what gave some doubters grist for the rumor mill : on friday -- three days before the scheduled meeting -- a @entity1 state media broadcaster prematurely aired a report that @entity0 had a meeting with @entity5 -- although the event had not yet occurred			1
the station acknowledged the error , but it only heightened the speculation over @entity0 and his whereabouts			2
social media has been swirling with questions , with hashtags such as # @entity70 and # putinmissing			0
was he ill ? was he holed away somewhere with his girlfriend and a new baby , as some in the @entity76 media speculated ? there were even dark rumors of a palace coup in which various @entity20 factions vying for power might have ousted him			0
the @entity20 vigorously denied that anything was amiss , with @entity0 's spokesman saying the president was healthy and that his handshake " can break a hand			1
" but his absence came at an uneasy time as the country deals with economic turmoil and strained international relations over the war in @entity93			0
" @entity94 ever catch a cold ? does he ever get sick ? the @entity20 does n't want to allow @entity0 's image of virility and strength to become tarnished by the weaknesses of mere humans , " @entity3 analyst @entity96 wrote			1
" @entity0 rules in the old - fashioned style of a personality cult			2
the system requires propaganda and image control			0
it needs @entity0 to be larger than life			2
" last week , presidential spokesman @entity109 sought to allay questions , telling @entity1 radio station @entity111 that people should not worry and that @entity0 was " absolutely " healthy			1
" no need to worry , everything is all right			0
he has working meetings all the time , only not all of these meetings are public , " @entity109 said thursday			0
he also dismissed @entity76 media reports that @entity0 had a love child			2
" i am going to ask people who have money to organize a contest on the best media rumor , " the @entity20 spokesman said			0
rumblings about @entity0 began last week after a meeting in the @entity128 capital , @entity129 , between the @entity1 leader and the presidents of @entity128 and @entity132 was postponed at short notice			1
a @entity128 official told @entity135 that @entity0 had fallen ill. on thursday , he missed his meeting with the @entity137 , @entity1 's counterintelligence agency			1
@entity0 's last public appearance was supposedly on march 8 , @entity139			1
but some keeping track say he had n't been seen since even earlier -- march 5			0
in the course of his many years in power , @entity0 has cultivated the image of a strong and vigorous leader			0
his exploits , captured on film and released to the media , have been many			0
and he enjoys a whopping 86 % approval rating , although some critics question the validity of polling they say is carried out in a climate where people are afraid to voice opposition to @entity0 's government			2
" @entity2 always has been a center for rumors and speculation , " said @entity156 , an expert on @entity1 at the @entity157 and a former @entity3 correspondent			0
" as soon as the president does not show up , which is really kind of rare for him , people begin to question			0
" you have to look at this in terms of , why all of this insanity ? and one of the problems is , people are very nervous , legitimately			0
where is @entity0 ? is he in charge ? " @entity3 's @entity176 contributed to this report .			2

@entity0 makes light of his absence , saying , " it would be boring without gossip "
