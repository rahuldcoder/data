when @entity3 photographer @entity2 first pressed the shutter on a borrowed @entity6 camera in 1967 , he was a teenager taking photos to kill time during chairman @entity10 's @entity9			1
" i made rolls of film out of a motion - picture reel i found			0
the photographic paper was left over from printing @entity10 's portraits , " @entity2 told @entity0			1
five decades later , @entity2 , 61 , is one of the country 's top photojournalists			1
his work is a rich chronicle of @entity3 's fast - changing society			1
" still images are fragments , sections and points that connect the history , " @entity2 says			1
" the whole process of @entity3 's reform over the past four decades -- whether going forward or stalling -- i 've been determined to and have managed to document it all			1
" one of his most famous series of photographs tracks @entity3 's relationship with the bicycle -- once a family 's most precious asset but now fast vanishing from the streets			1
photography was an outlet for @entity2 during the dark days of the @entity9 , when @entity3 was convulsed by violent class struggle			1
his family were labeled " capitalist roaders " and unlike most other kids , he could n't join the red guards			0
despondent , 14 - year - old @entity2 wandered around @entity44 with friends in similar situations , snapping pictures and portraits to distract himself			2
taking photos turned into more than a pastime in january 1976 , when premier @entity51 died - beloved by many for his role in tempering the worst of @entity10 's excesses			0
@entity2 went to @entity56 with his camera , capturing the unprompted outpouring of grief , both then , and again in april that year			2
" i was in deep grief , " @entity2 said , " and i felt i should record the collective grief			2
" he kept the film secret from the military , which then employed him as a photographer , transferring it to friends			0
the photos were published in the early 1980s			0
from then on , @entity2 saw that his camera was much more than a memory keeper			2
" i did n't get photojournalism until then , " he said			0
" my biggest regret was not to capture anything meaningful during the @entity9 period ; it would 've been a precious record			0
" in the decades following , @entity2 has photographed not only major events -- from @entity73 in 1976 and the overthrow of the @entity75 , to the @entity76 in 2008 -- but also intimate moments captured in @entity3 's changing countryside and growing cities			1
from april 3 , @entity2 will have the first overseas exhibition of his work in the @entity82 at the @entity83			1
curator @entity84 -- a @entity3 media scholar and former colleague of @entity2 -- said his work is a great window to examine contemporary @entity3			1
" it reflects not only the many changes in @entity3 society emerging over the past several decades but also the endurance of tradition , and the often striking and sometimes amusing clashes between tradition and change , " she said			1
the clash between tradition and modernity is stark in the lead picture of the exhibit â€” an elderly farmer looks on as a groom carries his bride through the field and " the couple 's @entity106 wedding garb contrasting with this longstanding custom , " she says			0
@entity2 has spent most of his career at the @entity110 , the country 's official english - language paper , which he joined in 1980 before its official launch			1
back then , it broke the mold , using large photographs rather than the stamp - sized images used in most other @entity3 newspapers at the time , he says			1
it was also unafraid to feature ordinary people on its pages , rather than national leaders -- something @entity2 found he excelled at			2
" thanks to the @entity110 , i stood out			0
it was an irreplaceable platform			0
" @entity2 finds himself nostalgic for the 1980s , when ideas emerged and collided after the @entity9 ended			2
" people thought nothing was impossible , " he said			0
" we reflected on the past and were determined to move on			0
it was a special time ; the air was filled with ideals , enthusiasm and all kinds of possibilities			0
" today 's @entity3 is different , he said			1
" the country 's goal has shifted toward a transition to a market economy since the 1990s , " he said			0
" individuals also have since switched their focus onto consumerism and incomes from ideals			0
" throughout his career , @entity2 's focus has changed a great deal as well			1
he said he used to focus on the technical and artistic aspects of photography , but now , with smart phones , he says anyone can be a photographer			0
to @entity2 , what matters is the perspective , he said , pointing at his head			2
@entity2 says he 's felt obligated to observe and criticize through his lens over the years			1
" my job is n't to chant slogans			0
" " i take photos first			0
it 's great if they can be published ; if not , they 'll eventually be part of the history			2
" next year will mark @entity2 's 40th year in photojournalism			1
he is planning to have a photo exhibition and wants to call it " unfinished			0
" the name was inspired by the alternative title of @entity174 's @entity173			0
" @entity3 is unfinished , " said @entity2 , who is also fan and critic of classic music			1
" it 's always a work in progress			2
