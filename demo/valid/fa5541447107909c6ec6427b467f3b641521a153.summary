i 'm @entity2 and i am professor of @entity3 and @entity4 at the @entity5			1
i was an adviser on the " @entity7 " episode and served as one of the many on - camera experts in @entity1 's " @entity12 " series , which currently airs on sundays			1
viewers were invited to tweet and post their questions on the " finding jesus " facebook page during the show			2
below are some of the more interesting questions and my answers to them			2
my apologies to everyone i did n't get to			2
feel free to tweet your questions to me directly			2
@entity24 : can anyone explain to me what the @entity27 's deal is with 40 days / nights ? @entity2 : it 's more an interest in the number 40			1
in the @entity27 the people of @entity33 wander in the wilderness for 40 years before they reach the @entity35			2
the flood lasts for 40 days and nights ; @entity38 spends 40 days and nights on the mountain ; @entity40 spends 40 days encouraging the @entity41 to challenge him before @entity42 steps up ; 40 is a common age for people to be when they get married ; in the book of judges it is always 40 years between judges ; and @entity42 and @entity49 each reigned for 40 years			2
what we can take away from all of this is that people in the ancient world saw 40 as suggesting a full , complete period of time			0
it 's sort of like a narrative stock number , in the way that modern jokes follow the rule of three			0
@entity62 : was there any division between the followers of @entity12 and the followers of @entity67 ? @entity2 : one of the interesting things about the relationship between @entity12 and @entity67 is that @entity70 does n't lay down his tools and follow @entity12 after he baptizes him			1
nor , it seems , did @entity70 's disciples			0
they had separate ministries and , while there may have been contact between the two groups , they were also @entity79 competitors in the ancient religious marketplace			0
there are some hints in the @entity3 that @entity12 and his followers had to differentiate themselves from @entity70 by stating that @entity12 ' baptism was better ( acts 11:6 ) and countering the idea that @entity12 was actually @entity70 raised from the dead ( @entity86 ) some scholars argue that these references are evidence of tension between followers of @entity12 and followers of @entity70			0
@entity93 answers your questions about the @entity96			0
@entity97 : can the dna tests on the bones indicate whether he is a jew or even whether he is of the tribe of @entity101 ? @entity2 : i 'm so glad someone brought up @entity104			1
the dna tests on the @entity106 bones yielded only mitochondrial dna ( @entity104 passed down by the mother ) , not the more reliable nuclear dna ( the kind of @entity104 referred to in forensic investigations )			1
in the original study of the @entity106 relics ( of which i was a part ) the mitochondrial dna revealed that the @entity106 relics were of " probable @entity116 origin			1
" thinking back to my time in the laboratory with the @entity120 scientists , i recall that the lead investigator estimated that the probability was about 75 %			0
the episode last night stated things a little too sharply when it said that the bones were from a @entity127 man			1
as for the more specific question about the genetics of @entity130 and members of the tribe of @entity101 : current scientific technology does not reveal this kind of information even if start - up genetic testing companies promise this kind of information			0
@entity139 : are there any other historical references of @entity67 outside of the @entity27 ? @entity142 : any extra-biblical sources that shed light on historical figure of @entity67 ? @entity2 : ( these questions are on a similar topic , so i 've chosen to answer them together			1
) actually there is external attestation for the life and importance of @entity67			1
this is important because it 's fairly rare to find this kind of evidence for ancient figures outside the writings of their followers			0
the @entity130 historian @entity162 mentions @entity67 in his book , " the jewish antiquities			1
" @entity162 describes @entity70 as a " good man " who possessed " virtue " and had " great influence " over the people			0
according to @entity162 , @entity170 put @entity67 to death because he was afraid that he might raise a rebellion			1
this gives us another -- arguably more historical -- perspective on why @entity70 was executed and provides further evidence about just how important @entity70 was in his own day			0
watch the latest full episode anytime on @entity178 @entity142 : wait , how did @entity12 get " @entity180 " prayer from @entity181 ? ? ? did n't catch that			2
@entity2 : i 'm also really glad someone brought this up , because i wondered about it too			1
in the @entity187 , one of @entity12 ' disciples says , " lord , teach us to pray , as @entity70 taught his disciples			0
" it 's an interesting request that tells us something about @entity67 's ministry and the demanding characters of @entity12 ' disciples ! in @entity187 , @entity12 responds to this request by teaching them the @entity180			1
we do n't know that the @entity180 came from @entity70 , and personally i do n't think it did ; i think this is just how @entity187 shaped his version of events			0
but if you were just reading @entity187 you could come to that conclusion .			0

religion professor @entity2 appears in each episode of the *program*
@entity2 was part of the original study to determine if relics found in @entity106 could be the bones of @entity67 .
