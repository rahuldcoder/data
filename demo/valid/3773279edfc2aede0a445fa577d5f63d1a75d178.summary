the recent controversy over a video showing @entity3 students , who also were members of the @entity5 fraternity , reciting a racist chant revealed a key difference in approaches to parenting			1
the university said @entity12 and @entity13 encouraged their brothers to sing the lyrics , which included multiple references to the " n - word " and mention of lynching			2
the two young men were expelled			2
and the fraternity was shut down			2
what caught my attention was the reaction of the families â€” the @entity27 and the @entity28			2
they could n't have been more different			2
that convinced me that this story was n't just about racist and juvenile behavior , but also about parenting			1
who raised these kids ? and should n't they have been taught better ? at some point , did n't it occur to these young men that they were not only shaming themselves , but also their families ? in @entity41 , protesters gathered outside the @entity13 home , holding signs with messages such as : " racism is taught			2
" @entity13 issued a statement , which was delivered to the @entity47 by his father , @entity48			2
in it , @entity13 apologized for actions that he called " wrong and reckless			1
" however , @entity48 had no response to the controversy			1
he told reporters : " at the moment , we are not doing interviews			2
" that is not good enough			0
parenthood is n't like politics			0
it does n't come with a " no comment " button we can press when the job gets uncomfortable			0
we have n't heard from @entity12			0
his parents , @entity67 and @entity68 , addressed their son 's misbehavior in a statement , which was given to the newspaper and posted on the family 's website			1
it read in part : " as parents of @entity12 , we love him and care for him deeply			1
he made a horrible mistake , and will live with the consequences forever			0
however , we also know the depth of our son 's character			0
he is a good boy , but what we saw in those videos is disgusting			0
while it may be difficult for those who only know @entity12 from the video to understand , we know his heart , and he is not a racist			1
... " of course , we are sad for our son -- but more importantly , we apologize to the community he has hurt			1
we would also like to apologize to the entire @entity95 - @entity94 community , @entity3 student body and administration			1
our family has the responsibility to apologize , and also to seek forgiveness and reconciliation			1
" that 's an impressive statement			0
i applaud the @entity27 for stepping up and refusing to blindly defend their son , as many parents might have done			1
they did what parents are supposed to do : they took responsibility for the actions of the person they raised			1
who knew that would be so controversial ? ever since the apologies were offered , there 's been discussions in this country about whether it 's really necessary for parents to apologize for the actions of their grown children			1
last week , while hosting a radio show in @entity126 , i brought up the story of the video and pointed to the different approaches that the @entity28 and the @entity27 have to parenting -- all the way from " we are not doing interviews " to " our family has the responsibility to apologize			1
" the @entity27 had the right idea , i insisted			0
a caller disagreed , saying he did n't see why he should have to apologize if his adult son did something wrong			1
" he 's his own person , " he said			0
based on what i 've heard in the last few days , i would imagine that there are many people who agree with the caller			0
they seem to believe that , when their son or daughter turns 18 , their job is finished			0
they ca n't wait to wash their hands of any additional responsibility , and they might even frame their retreat as a way of advancing the principle that everyone should take responsibility for his own actions			1
but i do n't think it 's either / or			0
of course , individuals should take responsibility for their actions			1
yet , as the @entity27 demonstrated with their statement , when something goes terribly wrong , there is usually enough responsibility to go around			0
when appropriate , parents can take a slice			2
besides , i bet a lot of parents believe -- as i do -- that we should never stop loving our children			1
but at some point , it 's perfectly fine for us to just stop claiming them as our own ? it just looks like some parents ca n't wait to find the exit			2
we tell people to drink responsibly			0
we tell them to drive responsibly			0
we need to start telling them to parent responsibly			0
after all , parenting a child is the most important job that many of us will have in this world			0
and there is no date of retirement .			0

the controversy over @entity3 students reciting a racist chant raises a number of issues
@entity195 : is it necessary for parents to apologize for the *bad* actions of their grown children ?
