a statue of a sitting @entity2 that made its way from a temple in @entity5 to a market in the @entity7 revealed an extraordinary secret -- a 1,000 - year - old mummified monk			1
the mummy was discovered , encased in a cavity in the statue , when a private buyer brought it to an expert for restoration			0
it 's unclear when or how the statue was removed from @entity5			1
but it was n't until a team of researchers and scientists did a ct scan -- a comprehensive three dimensional x-ray image -- last year , did they discover the mummy 's organs were missing			0
" we thought it would be lung tissue , but instead we found little scraps of paper covered with @entity5 characters , " said @entity28 , an archaeology curator from @entity29			2
the mummy was found sitting on a bundle of cloth covered in @entity5 inscriptions , revealing its identity as a @entity42 monk called @entity43 who may have practiced " self - mummification " to prepare for life after death			1
the process of self - mummification is a known tradition in countries like @entity51 , @entity5 and @entity52 , and was practiced over a thousand years ago			1

researchers are still waiting on dna analysis results in hopes to trace the mummy back to its exact location in @entity5			2
