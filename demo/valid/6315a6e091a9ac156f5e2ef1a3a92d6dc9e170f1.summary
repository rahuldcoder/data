for the first time , the @entity0 has resurrected a b - 52 bomber that had been in long - term storage at the @entity5 , the portion of @entity7 near @entity8 , @entity9 , where the military sends aircraft that have been retired from the fleet			1
the 53 - year - old @entity13 , tail number 61 - 1007 , nicknamed the " ghost rider " had been in storage at the desert in the care of the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) since 2008			1
thousands of aircraft are stored at the @entity5 , where the dry desert environment helps preserve them			0
some are scavenged to supply parts to planes still in the fleet			0
others are brought back into service			2
ghost rider , after upgrades , will become the first @entity13 to return to duty from the @entity5			1
though the dry desert air inhibits corrosion , the baking heat can have other adverse effects , including causing dry rot in the tires and fuel lines			0
the lines and fuel bladders in @entity28 were completely replaced , @entity38 sgt. @entity37 , a fuels specialist from the @entity40 , said in an @entity0 report on the project			1
once that work was done , the plane 's engines were tested again in january			0
on february 13 , @entity28 flew again , a three - hour flight from @entity7 to its new home , @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity52			1
the resurrection process took 70 days , according to the @entity0 report " i 've been flying the b - 52s since the ' 80s and it surprised me that after almost seven years ... she cranked up just fine and we had no issues with the flight control systems , " col. @entity59 said in the @entity0 report after piloting the eight - engine jet on the 1,000 - mile flight			1
@entity66 , who with more than 6,500 hours flying @entity67 is the most experienced active pilot of that aircraft in the service , led a co-pilot and a navigator , the minimum three - person crew , on the flight to @entity52			1
the @entity13 would normally fly with a crew of five			1
" those were the only three seats we had activated for egress , " he told the @entity76			0
for safety reasons , @entity28 made the entire flight with its landing gear down , at a speed of only 288 mph and at a height of 23,000 feet , well below its top speed of 650 mph and ceiling of 50,000 feet , according to the @entity76 report			2
it also flew without some of the other things aviators have come to rely on			0
" we were fortunate to have had good weather the entire trip as the inertial and navigational equipment had not been installed , " @entity91 said in the @entity0 release			2
ghost rider will replace another bomber at @entity50 that was damaged by a fire during maintenance			0
" we had an oxygen leak with a spark and it caused a cockpit fire			0
there was so much damage it was actually more economical to bring this one out of the desert , " @entity66 told the @entity76			0
for a time , @entity28 will sit beside the damaged @entity13 for transfer of usable , updated equipment , the @entity76 reported			1
it is expected to resume active service next year			2
as of may 2014 , the @entity0 reported there were 76 @entity113 in its fleet , 58 in the active force and 18 in the @entity116			2
besides @entity118 , b - 52s are based at @entity119 in @entity120 .			0
