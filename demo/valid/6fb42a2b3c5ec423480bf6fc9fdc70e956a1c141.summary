a runway at @entity2 's @entity1 reopened friday morning , a day after a @entity5 plane skidded off it before halting near the icy waters of @entity8			1
runway 13 remained closed until the plane could be removed and brought into a hangar			1
it reopened at 10:30 a.m. et friday , according to @entity12 , a spokesman for the @entity13 and @entity14			0
the @entity5 plane slid off the runway thursday morning , with its nose busting through a fence before skidding to a halt mere feet from frigid waters			1
@entity23 1086 briefly circled @entity2 due to issues with snow and ice before touching down shortly after 11 a.m. thursday , passenger @entity22 told @entity3			2
almost as soon as it did , those aboard realized something was wrong -- the aircraft 's wheels seemed to have little to no traction , sliding for about 20 seconds			1
" you did n't feel the wheels take , " @entity22 said			0
then it was a matter of " where we are going to end up , " he said			0
about 4,500 to 5,000 feet down runway 13 , the @entity38 veered to the left and mercifully stopped on a small embankment			2
a little farther , and the plane -- with 127 passengers and five crew members -- would have been in @entity8 rather than on the airport 's snow - covered ground			1
contrary to what @entity5 said in a statement , the aircraft 's slides did not deploy , according to @entity13 executive director @entity50			2
still , with help from first responders , everyone was able to get off and onto buses that took them to @entity1 's @entity5 terminal			1
@entity57 showed passengers exiting the plane into the subfreezing temperatures as emergency vehicles converged on the area			1
twenty - four people suffered injuries that were non-life threatening			1
three of those were transported to nearby hospitals , the @entity65 tweeted			2
@entity22 said he was thankful for the plane 's crew , first responders and @entity72 that it was n't much worse			1
" it was cause for a moment of prayer and a moment of reflection , as people were scared , " he said			0
" the pilot did a phenomenal job			0
" the plane left a relatively balmy @entity84 shortly after 9 a.m. @entity1 was dealing with snow and freezing fog as the flight approached its destination about two hours later			1
before touching down , the plane 's pilot said weather problems could cause a delay			1
still , little prepared passengers for what happened			0
@entity22 said he was reminded of the @entity96 plane that landed in the @entity97 in 2009			2
all 155 people aboard that flight -- heading from @entity1 to @entity100 , @entity101 -- famously survived thanks to the skills of pilot @entity104			1
the landing of @entity106 was terrifying for many			0
" there were people that were calm , there were people that were praying , there were people that obviously were frantic , there were people that were crying , " @entity22 said			0
@entity119 , another passenger , was traveling with his brother			2
" when the plane landed it was like me falling off of the top bunk -- did n't really know what was going on -- i just felt a hit , boom , " he told @entity3 's " @entity128			1
" " i just prayed			0
" the @entity13 chief said plows had cleared the runway minutes before @entity132 touched down and that two other landing pilots had reported " good braking " action on @entity135			1
still , that does n't mean the pilot did anything wrong			0
" i think the pilot did everything he could to slow the aircraft down , " @entity50 said			0
" obviously , the pilot and the co-pilot 's efforts were reflected in the fact there were only minor injuries			2
" after the plane stopped , emotions ratcheted down some but not entirely			0
@entity22 said there was some " panic and shoving your way to the front " to get off , though " for the most part it was very orderly			0
" passengers spent a few minutes standing in the snow -- carrying little more than their wallets and phones -- before buses took them into the warmth and comfort of the terminal			0
four minutes after the plane landed , all of @entity1 shut down to air traffic			1
one of its two runways -- the one not involved in the incident -- reopened a few hours later			0
@entity3 's @entity171 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 's @entity135 reopens after plane removed
