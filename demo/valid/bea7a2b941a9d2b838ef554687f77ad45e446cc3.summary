you may not know it , but comedian @entity3 actually made a bit of history even before being named to succeed @entity6 as host of " @entity8			1
" the 31 - year - old @entity10 comic has made only a few appearances on that show since popping up as a correspondent in december , but he 's better known within the world of standup comedy			1
in 2013 , @entity3 became the first @entity10 comedian to perform on " @entity17 with @entity18			1
" he 's been on the cover of @entity20 in @entity10 , where he 's extremely popular			1
he 's joked about being the son of a black @entity10 woman and a white @entity25 man who met when interracial relationships were illegal in @entity10			1
" my mom would be arrested			0
she would be fined , and still she was like ' ooh , i do n't care , i want a white man , ooh , ' " he once told an audience at @entity32 's @entity31 during his standup show " the @entity34			1
" " and my dad was also like , well , you know how the @entity25 love chocolate			2
" why mixed - race comic was ' born a crime ' race , identity and ethnicity have figured in prominently in his act			1
because of his parents ' then - illegal relationship , he joked , " in the streets , my father could n't walk with us			0
he would walk on the other side of the road and wave at me like a creepy pedophile			0
and my mom could walk with me , but every time the police went by , she would drop me			0
i felt like a bag of weed			0
" @entity3 has said in his act that he lost touch with his father for several years because of apartheid			1
in 2012 , he told @entity59 that he was fascinated by how @entity60 discuss race			0
" i got to @entity62 , and i was expecting ... because urban means built up and new , you know , " he said			0
" so i got there , and i was , ' whoa , it 's not as urban as people told me			0
' ... but it 's very black			2
i 'll tell you that much			0
" @entity3 told @entity1 's " @entity79 " in 2013 that after finding success in his homeland -- where he starred on a soap opera , hosted his own radio show and was the subject of the 2012 documentary " you laugh but it 's true " -- he moved to the @entity60 for a year to try to raise his profile			1
he returned to his country with new material shaped by his time spent in the @entity60 , he said			0
" comedy is really getting quite popular in @entity10 , " @entity3 said			1
" it 's moving from the bastard child of entertainment into the mainstream , which is very good			0

" @entity3 has moved to the @entity60 permanently and told @entity91 , " i 've always wanted to be a comedian in the world			2
i do n't want to be labeled a @entity10 comedian			2
" on " @entity8 , " he debuted as a correspondent with a bit titled " @entity97 , " which juxtaposed modern - day @entity10 and the @entity60			2
what remains to be seen is whether what the @entity100 has described as " his combination of terribly polite , butter - would n't - melt stage presence and biting , often brutal gags " will translate into success on " @entity8			0

@entity3 is the son of a black @entity10 woman and a white @entity25 man
