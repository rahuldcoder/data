he was detained immediately after the attack , with authorities having time to formally arrest him or let him go			1
@entity16 , 55 , who has a history of unpredictable behavior , could eventually be charged with attempted murder and other charges			0
a police official , @entity28 , also told reporters that @entity16 had previously visited @entity11 seven times between 1999 and 2007 , and that authorities were " intensively investigating " a possible connection between his visits to the reclusive state and this attack			1
the @entity6 ambassador to @entity2 , @entity37 , was in stable condition after undergoing more than two hours of surgery , in which he got 80 stitches to his face			1
he will probably remain hospitalized for three to four days , said dr. @entity43 at @entity44			0
in 2010 , @entity16 received a suspended two - year prison sentence for throwing a piece of concrete at a @entity49 ambassador to @entity2 , according to the @entity51 news agency			0
the motive for his attack thursday ? he wanted an end to the @entity2 - @entity6 military drills to improve @entity58 relations , police said			1
the drills are held annually despite predictably harsh criticism from @entity11			1
the @entity11 government believes the attack is " just punishment for @entity6 warmongers , " according to its official news agency , @entity65			1
@entity2 president @entity67 , on the other hand , condemned it			0
" this incident is not only a physical attack on the @entity6 ambassador , " she said , " but an attack on the @entity2 - @entity6 alliance and it can never be tolerated			1
" @entity6 diplomats have been attacked , killed in past @entity37 was attacked while attending an event organized by the @entity78 , which advocates peaceful reunification between the two @entity81			1
the @entity6 @entity83 did not request special security for the event , @entity1 police said			1
three police officers were on duty at the building 's entrance , and 25 others were on standby			0
@entity16 sat down at a different table than @entity37 , then got up and ran to the ambassador 's right side yelling something that sounded like anti-american sentiments			1
" when the man jumped on the ambassador , i stood up and jumped on the man , and they both fell on the ground , " a witness , @entity101 , told @entity3 affiliate @entity95			1
" luckily i got on top of the man 's back and could press him to the floor			2
then others came to hold him on the floor			0
" @entity101 said he later saw the knife on the table			0
it had a wooden handle and did not look particularly sophisticated , he said			0
@entity1 police said a knife , about 10 inches long , was used in the assault and the suspect brought it from home			0
videos showed the suspect pinned on the floor , rolled into a blanket and carried out of the building			0
he was heard shouting , " the @entity2 - @entity6 military drills must stop			2
" the drills began earlier this week			0
explaining the joint @entity2 - @entity6 military exercises after the attack , @entity37 -- clutching his right cheek and holding a bloodied arm -- was photographed hurrying out of the @entity128 in central @entity1			1
the cut to his face runs from his right cheekbone to his lower jaw and is about 4 inches long and about an inch deep , dr. @entity43 said			0
fortunately , there was no damage to his facial nerve			0
@entity37 also suffered five gashes in his left arm and hand , but he is not likely to have permanent damage to his arm function			2
" the ambassador was very calm			0
people around him were taken aback , but he was very calm , " said dr. @entity144			0
" he was speaking with his doctor on what to do			0
" as the ambassador left and headed to the hospital , investigators arrived , hoping to figure out exactly what happened			0
while there are videos showing what happened at the event , none of them will be from closed - circuit surveillance cameras , said @entity162 , the @entity1 police chief			0
the only such camera outside the building did help authorities determine exactly when @entity37 and @entity16 came in			1
was the attack part of a larger plot ? did @entity16 have any help , implicit or explicit ? not if you ask him , according to the @entity1 police chief			0
" @entity16 insists that this was done by himself , " @entity162 said			0
" but police are still investigating if he acted alone and what his motive was			0
" @entity175 , @entity2 's president , told @entity37 by phone that she was surprised and deeply troubled to hear about the attack -- an incident similar to one targeting her several years ago -- the @entity183 nation 's @entity181 said on its website			1
the @entity2 leader vowed that authorities will " take necessary measures ... with utmost seriousness and urgency " to get to the bottom of the latest attack			2
she also promised to keep close ties with the @entity6 " so that the incident would not have any negative implications on the ( @entity2 ) - @entity6 alliance , " according to the ministry			2
for @entity175 's @entity6 counterpart , president @entity197 , the attack is personal as well as political			1
that 's because @entity37 is a longtime friend and confidant , having been part of @entity197 's inner circle for years			1
@entity197 called @entity37 " to tell him that he and his wife @entity205 are in his thoughts and prayers , and to wish him the very best for a speedy recovery , " @entity203 spokeswoman @entity202 said			2
@entity37 has been close to @entity197 ever since he arrived in the @entity210 in 2005			2
@entity37 worked with @entity197 on the @entity211 and traveled the world with the then - senator as he garnered the foreign policy experience that helped pave the way for his presidential campaign			2
when @entity197 declared he would run for president in the 2008 race , @entity37 was by his side again , and was on the road with the candidate and ultimately served as the chief foreign policy adviser for the @entity197 campaign			2
@entity197 nominated @entity37 to serve as ambassador to @entity2 last year			1
thursday afternoon , @entity37 tweeted that he was recuperating			2
" doing well & in great spirits ! @entity205 , @entity226 , @entity227 & i - deeply moved by the support ! " he tweeted , referring to his wife , his son and his dog			0
