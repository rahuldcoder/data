a group of medical students -- including an @entity3 , seven @entity4 and a @entity5 -- may be the latest westerners to join @entity7			1
it 's become a familiar story : young people give up their futures in @entity13 democratic nations to join the terrorist network establishing a self - declared @entity16 state in the @entity17			2
last month , three teenage @entity4 girls suspected of wanting to join @entity7 may have gone to @entity20 , authorities said			1
an estimated 3,400 @entity6 have gone to join @entity7 in its bloody quest to establish an @entity24 state in @entity25 and @entity20 , said @entity26 , director of the @entity27			1
analysts and @entity3 officials agree : @entity7 is skilled at luring @entity6 , attracting far greater numbers than @entity31			1
how is it doing this ? @entity7 recruits are often young -- sometimes disillusioned teenagers trying to find purpose and make their mark			1
" the general picture provided by foreign fighters of their lives in @entity20 suggests camaraderie , good morale and purposeful activity , all mixed in with a sense of understated heroism , designed to attract their friends as well as to boost their own self - esteem , " counterterrorism expert @entity36 wrote last year in a report called " foreign fighters in @entity20			2
" @entity51 , professor of @entity17 studies at the @entity53 , put it more bluntly : " @entity7 provides these deluded young men and women with an adventurous trip			1
" many recruits come from educated , well - to - do backgrounds , like 25 - year - old @entity60 of @entity4			1
he said he had no problem leaving a comfortable lifestyle to join @entity7			1
" i 'm from the south of @entity64			2
i grew up in a middle - class family , " he told @entity0			2
" life was easy back home			2
but the thing is , you can not practice @entity16 back home			2
we see all around us evil			0
" the names : who has been recruited to @entity7 from the @entity80 some are lured by the possibility of dying as a martyr so they can enjoy a sumptuous afterlife			1
others may succumb to more tangible promises			0
@entity7 loyalists are told they will receive gifts from @entity90 , wrote @entity91 , a young @entity4 woman who left @entity92 to join @entity7 and now is an @entity7 recruiter			1
such gifts include " a house with free electricity and water provided to you due to the @entity100 ( the caliphate or state ) and no rent included , " @entity94 wrote			0
@entity7 ' slick propaganda videos resemble trailers for @entity107 action movies			1
one hourlong video showed a collection of bombings , executions , kidnappings and beheadings			0
as one roadside bomb blasts a vehicle into the sky , two men in the background of the video chuckle			0
@entity7 now has the most sophisticated propaganda machine of any terrorist organization , said @entity122 , former director of the @entity27			1
" it turns out timely , high - quality media , and it uses social media to secure a widespread following , " he said			0
even the @entity126 admits @entity7 ' propaganda prowess " is something we have not seen before			1
" " it 's something we need to do a lot more work on , " @entity126 spokeswoman @entity129 said last month			0
" we are seeing 90,000 , i think , tweets a day that we 're combating			0
" " we are way behind			0
they are far superior and advanced than we are when it comes to new media technologies , " @entity136 , a former jihadi and author of " radical : my journey out of @entity140 , " told @entity0 last year			0
" ... it is very attractive for angry young @entity142 when they see these sorts of videos and they hear language that resonates with them			2
" the slick strategy offers a big edge over @entity31			2
@entity7 " has proven far more adept than core @entity31 -- or any of @entity31 's affiliates -- at using new media tools to reach a broader audience , " @entity26 said			1
recruits are also being lured by @entity7 ' success in its endeavor to create an @entity16 state , analysts say			1
the intelligence community determined that @entity7 ' battlefield successes gave it " some recruitment success , " @entity159 spokesman @entity158 said in september			1
" militant groups across the @entity16 world see the success @entity7 has had so far in @entity20 and @entity25 and opt to join it -- often leaving behind organizations plagued by infighting , " @entity0 national security analyst @entity163 wrote in a @entity0 column			1
" this is a political cult using religion and a perversion of @entity16 as the shield , " said @entity170 , founder of @entity170 , a group dedicated to exposing destructive cults and cult behavior			0
" but in fact , it 's a systematic effort to create an army of basically tranced - out followers			0
" that type of brainwashing is what turned @entity5 @entity185 into an @entity7 militant , said his mother , @entity187			1
" it 's so easy for them to get to our children , to access our children , " she said			0
@entity185 died fighting in @entity20 last year			0
while @entity7 ' recruiting success gets a lot of attention , it is hardly drawing a huge percentage of young @entity6			1
about 130 @entity5 citizens have traveled to the @entity17 to join @entity7 , @entity5 's intelligence agency estimated last year			1
about 1,200 @entity200 fighters have joined @entity7 as well			1
roughly 600 @entity4 nationals are believed to have gone to @entity25 and @entity20 , according to research groups , along with another 600 from @entity203			1
in the @entity3 , national intelligence director @entity204 has said 180 @entity3 have tried to go to fight in @entity20			2
but it 's unclear how many of those were attempting to join @entity7			1
once foreigners go to @entity25 or @entity20 to join @entity7 , their odds of going back to their families can be slim			1
video clips of foreign jihadists burning their passports show that many have no interest in returning home			0
@entity13 leaders acknowledge there 's work to do			0
" it needs every school , every university , every college , every community to recognize they have a role to play , we all have a role to play in stopping people from having their minds poisoned by this appalling death cult , " @entity4 prime minister @entity220 said last year			2
the @entity3 government is trying to step up its efforts to counter @entity7 propaganda by beefing up a small @entity126 agency to make it the heart of the fight against the militants ' messaging			1
" we 're seeing their approaches continue to evolve , " @entity129 , the @entity126 spokeswoman , told @entity0			0
" we need to continue to make sure ours are evolving and we 're combating it in the most strategic way and using every interagency resource			0
" but she acknowledged that the @entity3 still has a lot to do			2
" we 're really going to pick it up now , " @entity129 said			0
" we have new people in charge of the office			0
and we will see what happens over the coming months			0
" several @entity251 efforts are already in place			0
some @entity254 countries have laws that penalize membership in groups such as @entity7 , said @entity36 , the counterterrorism expert			2
and @entity126 official @entity259 said an @entity251 messaging campaign has helped prevent youths from joining			0
" they 're reading the messages , they 're hearing the messages -- not just from us but from the hundreds of @entity16 clerics who have said that this is a perversion of @entity16 , from the hundreds of @entity16 scholars who have said the same thing , " @entity259 said in october			2
but @entity36 said some officials might not be doing as much as they think			0
" policymakers often underestimate the impact of what is happening in these closed circles even as they overestimate the impact of their own			0
" @entity0 's @entity279 , @entity280 , @entity281 , @entity282 , @entity283 , @entity284 , @entity285 and @entity286 contributed to this report .			0

@entity7 has a *penchant* for producing slick videos that resemble trailers for @entity107 action movies
analyst : many recruits lack a sense of belonging ; some want a *lavish* afterlife by dying as a " martyr "
hundreds from the @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity200 and the @entity3 are suspected of going to join @entity7
