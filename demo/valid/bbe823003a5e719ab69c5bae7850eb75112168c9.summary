the @entity0 will pay whistleblower @entity2 $ 335,000 to settle her lawsuit with the university , following the largest academic fraud scandal in @entity7 history			1
@entity2 is the former athletics literacy counselor who blew the whistle about the fake classes that went on for nearly 20 years at the prestigious university			1
@entity2 spent years fielding attacks from university officials -- including accusations that she was lying when she said that officials within the athletic department steered underprepared athletes into the fake classes to keep them eligible			1
for nearly five years , @entity0 denied those claims , but @entity2 refused to keep quiet			1
she first told her story to the @entity20 in @entity21 , and then to national media when the university refused to admit that the classes were well - known to faculty			1
the added attention forced @entity0 to hire a new investigator and launch a new probe in 2014			2
that latest review , led by @entity29 , a 19 - year veteran of the @entity30 , found exactly what @entity2 had always claimed -- widespread and systematic cheating			2
@entity2 left her job last spring after complaining that she was being retaliated against			2
" the university 's settlement with mrs. @entity2 resolves all of the outstanding legal issues in the case , " said @entity34 , associate vice chancellor of communications and public affairs			1
" we appreciate the efforts of the mediator to help us achieve a successful and timely conclusion to the mediation			0
we believe the settlement is in the best interest of the @entity0 and allows us to move forward and fully focus on other important issues			2
" when she sued , @entity2 said she hoped to accomplish what no other investigation has done -- to subpoena documents and to depose university officials under oath			1
her lawsuit never got that far			0
instead , she says she 's hoping that will be accomplished by a larger class - action lawsuit filed by powerhouse attorney @entity56 on behalf of two former @entity0 athletes			1
@entity58 and @entity59 both sued in january , saying they were promised an education but did n't get one because of the paper class scandal			0
@entity56 is the attorney who beat the @entity7 last summer in federal court on behalf of former @entity65 player @entity64 , winning a case that will forever change college sports by forcing the @entity7 to eliminate the rule that forbids schools from paying players			0
that lawsuit is the reason @entity2 says she was ok with entering into mediation in her whistleblower suit			2
she shared the settlement document with @entity1			0
" it 's about the students and not about me			0
i do n't need it to be about me , " @entity2 said			0
" i got an education , but those students left without one , and we still have a system that does n't work			0
and so i 'm hopeful that ( the @entity56 lawsuit ) will move forward and prove that ( @entity84 ) schools all across the country have a flawed system where a promise of an education is n't happening , and therefore these students are getting nothing			0
" @entity2 is co-founder of @entity90 , which serves as a portal and rallying point for the college sports reform movement and includes a program to give students reading help in middle school			1
@entity1 analysis : some college athletes play like adults , read like fifth - graders			0

@entity2 accused @entity0 of holding fake classes that helped athletes stay in school
the university denied the charge for years , but *independent* investigation *confirmed* it
