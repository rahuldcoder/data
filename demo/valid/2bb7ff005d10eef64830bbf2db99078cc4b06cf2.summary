in @entity1 , we are seeing the re-emergence this year of a phenomenon that many @entity5 were afraid had gone extinct : real live no - joke bipartisanship			1
heavyweights from both parties are attending the march 26 @entity9 on @entity10			1
the event is co-produced by @entity12 ( on the right ) and by my project , # cut50 -- an initiative that aims to safely halve the number of people behind bars within 10 years			1
attorney general @entity21 will be speaking			1
so will @entity22 , the @entity23 former house speaker			1
sen. @entity24 , @entity25 , will be there			1
so will @entity27 strategist and @entity2 commentator @entity26 , a co-host of the summit			2
@entity23 power players like former @entity32 gov. @entity31 , @entity34 gov. @entity33 and sen. @entity35 , @entity36 , will address the gathering by video			2
progressives like myself will rub shoulders with representatives from @entity44			1
everyone keeps asking me , " how is this possible ? " i have five words for you : " @entity48 and justice for all			2
" the ever - expanding incarceration industry has begun to violate some of the deepest and most sacred principles of both major political parties			2
therefore , conservatives , libertarians and liberals have their own objective interests in reform -- and their own values - based incentives to make real changes			2
for example , the right takes very seriously the concept of " liberty			2
" conservatives and libertarians want to defend the rights of every individual to pursue his or her dreams			2
they hate massive , failed , bloated government bureaucracies that suck up more and more money and get more and more power , no matter how badly they perform			2
in @entity5 today , we have 5 % of the world 's population -- but we have nearly 25 % of the world 's incarcerated people			1
nearly 1 in 100 @entity5 adults is behind bars			1
one out of every four people locked up anywhere in the world is caged in @entity5 's prisons and jails			1
and most people come out more damaged , more hopeless and less able to thrive than when they went in			2
( so much for " corrections " ! ) that 's the opposite of limited government -- and liberty			1
on the other hand , progressives like me care passionately about the " justice for all " part -- including racial justice and social justice			2
we are incensed by a system that locks up the poor and racial minorities in numbers that are massive -- and massively disproportionate			1
we oppose a system that forever tars people as " felons , " deemed permanently unfit for employment or the right to vote , possibly because of one mistake , early in life			0
when any system violates the principles of both " liberty " and " justice , " @entity5 of all stripes should stand together to change it			1
that is exactly what is starting to happen			0
this year , we are seeing the birth of an honest - to - goodness " @entity48 " coalition			0
still struggling to believe me ? i was on " @entity126 " on monday night to discuss the movement for criminal justice reform			0
here is a quote : " a lot of kids i grew up with , grammar school , middle school , high school , were in prison			0
they were the poor kids and they had drug addictions			0
they had drug problems , they did n't have any money , they got caught , and they got caught in the poverty cycle , and they are at the bottom of society and they ca n't get out of it			0
... people with drug problems , people who have mental illnesses , they probably should n't be in the criminal justice system			0
and people who make mistakes , let 's not write them off forever , let 's give them a chance to reintegrate and reenter society			1
" there is just one catch : i 'm not the one who said that			0
that is a direct quote from @entity164 , senior vice president of @entity44			1
on practically every other issue , the @entity44 brothers and i are still fierce opponents			1
i doubt if we will ever agree on tax policy , campaign finance reform , environmental rules or the @entity171 , to name a few			1
but on criminal justice reform , it 's different			1
@entity164 speaks eloquently about the way the criminal justice system violates the @entity176 and criminalizes behaviors that should not result in prison terms			0
and he is not alone , on the right			0
fiscal conservatives decry the money wasted on a system that is too expensive and produces poor results			0
that 's one reason that red - state governors , like @entity187 's @entity186 , have acted boldly			1
leaders with roots on the religious right , including summit co-host @entity191 , insist on the @entity193 value of redemption and second chances for those behind bars			0
our values may not always be identical , but they can find common expression in fixing this broken prison system			0
progressives and conservatives do n't have to trust each other -- or even like each other -- to vote together on this issue			0
usually , " bipartisanship " is just another word for cheap , political gamesmanship			0
it is too often invoked by one side , simply to gain advantage and to cloak a more narrow set of interests			0
but on criminal justice reform , something different is happening			0
criminal justice reform is the one place where many @entity23 , @entity27 and @entity219 actually agree -- and are willing to work together to get something done			1
over the last 30 years , both parties helped lead us down the path to mass incarceration			0
it will take both political parties to reverse course			0
perhaps the march 26 @entity9 will represent the first major bend in the road back toward sanity .			0

@entity230 : @entity5 locks up far too many of its *citizens* , and there 's a bipartisan effort to change that
he says president @entity39 , the @entity44 brothers , @entity22 , @entity24 and others agree on it
