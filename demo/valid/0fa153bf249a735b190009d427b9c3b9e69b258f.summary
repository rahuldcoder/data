@entity1 's goal to run for two offices in 2016 cleared a hurdle saturday after the @entity5 decided to move forward with a proposal to hold a presidential caucus rather than a primary			1
the plan allows the first - term @entity11 senator , who 's running for re-election and making a likely bid for president , to get around a @entity16 law that prohibits candidates from appearing on the same ballot twice			0
@entity1 searches for green light on caucus proposal after @entity1 met with the party 's 54 - member executive committee in @entity24 for a two - hour session , the group voted unanimously to appoint a smaller committee that would decide the rules and regulations of how a caucus would be held			1
the final vote would come in august when a larger gathering of the @entity5 is scheduled to meet and hear a more detailed plan from the task force			1
" we thank the members of @entity38 for their unanimous support and look forward to continuing this process , " said @entity1 's top adviser , @entity34 , in a statement			2
@entity16 law allows the state party to determine the details of its presidential preference vote , but not the primary for other elected offices in the state			0
in other words , @entity1 's name for his @entity50 re-election bid would still remain on the may 2016 primary ballot , but the presidential vote would likely move up earlier in the year to march			1
the senator appeared at the meeting to address some concerns about a caucus , namely the increased cost , as well as the lower voter turnout typically associated with caucuses			0
he has pledged to raise money through his donor network to help offset the costs , and proponents of the caucus argue that the significant media attention expected and @entity16 's earlier placement in the nominating calendar would spur just as much turnout			0
@entity16 secretary of state @entity70 , a @entity71 , issued a scathing statement saturday , saying a @entity77 caucus next year " could create potential chaos in our electoral process " and promised to " monitor the situation " in the coming months			2
" in the meantime , i call on the @entity77 of @entity16 to provide details on how all their voters would be able to participate and how the party intends to uphold the integrity of the process , " she said .			0

@entity1 wants his hat in ring for both president and @entity50
@entity5 moves toward creating caucus to allow that *scenario*
*democratic* state official *criticizes* move
