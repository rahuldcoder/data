the @entity0 is asking detectives across the country to dust off their cold case murder files and see whether millionaire heir @entity5 could be connected to any other unsolved crimes			1
@entity5 , the focus of @entity9 's true crime documentary series " @entity10 , " was charged with first - degree murder last week in the 2000 killing of his longtime confidante , @entity13			1
now the @entity0 is putting out a call to local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where @entity5 lived over the past five decades , a @entity15 law enforcement official said			1
unsolved cases in @entity22 , @entity23 , the @entity24 and @entity25 are among those getting a new look , the official said			1
@entity5 's attorney , @entity28 , said it 's a sign that authorities are desperate			1
" they seem to be going to such great lengths to pin something else on him , " @entity28 said			0
" they must not have much of a case to begin with			0
" @entity5 , who authorities believe has a net worth of $ 100 million , has lived in numerous places and owned property in at least four states , according to court documents and public records			1
in " @entity10 , " @entity5 describes the time he spent living in @entity22 with his first wife , @entity45 , running a health food store in the 1970s			1
in 1982 , @entity47 went missing			0
@entity5 says he last saw her when he dropped her off at a train station in @entity49 , @entity23 , and she headed to their @entity51 apartment			2
her family members say they believe she 's dead and that @entity5 is the one to blame			1
the case has never been solved			0
he 's also lived in @entity56 , @entity57 , where he admitted to shooting a neighbor and dismembering the body in 2001			2
he was acquitted in a 2003 murder trial after arguing he 'd acted in self - defense			0
last week , police searched condos @entity5 owns in @entity64 as part of the investigation into @entity13 's death			1
she was shot dead in december 2000 in her @entity69 , @entity25 , home			0
investigators know @entity5 was in @entity25 the week @entity13 died			1
it 's a detail @entity5 shrugs off in the @entity9 documentary , in which he denied he had anything to do with @entity13 's death and said , " @entity25 's a big state			1
" authorities investigating a decades - old cold case in @entity22 said monday that there 's a connection between @entity5 and the case of @entity80 , a college student who disappeared from @entity81 in 1971			1
" we are aware of the connection between the disappearance of @entity80 and @entity5 , " @entity83 capt. @entity82 said			2
" we have been aware of this connection for several years and have been working with various outside agencies as we follow this lead			0
" @entity82 elaborated tuesday on the nature of the connection , saying @entity5 owned a health food store where @entity93 shopped the day she disappeared			1
but there is no evidence the two had met , @entity82 said			0
@entity28 's attorney brushed off the accusation monday			1
" you know , he may have been in @entity101 when @entity102 disappeared , " he said			0
" he 's an easy target			0
" the name of the health food store , " @entity106 , " was also the title of a 2010 film starring @entity109 and @entity110 that was a thinly veiled fictional take on the @entity5 case			1
after seeing the film , @entity5 reached out to director @entity114 and said he wanted to be interviewed			2
the interviews with @entity5 became the basis for " @entity10			2
" @entity5 says in the documentary that he had traveled during the week of @entity13 's death to @entity119 , @entity25 , a small coastal city in northern @entity25			1
" it was very rural , very pretty , " he says			0
and it was a place , @entity5 says , where he lived " off and on			1
" in @entity122 , about 20 miles south , @entity5 has been part of another investigation			2
authorities there say they have n't ruled out the possibility he could be connected to the disappearance of @entity129 , who went missing in november 1997 when she was 16 years old			0
the police chief said investigators were interested in learning what @entity5 has to say about that case now that he 's behind bars			1
" we are certainly interested in any information that may or may not come out of interviews with mr. @entity5 , " police chief @entity135 said			1
" if information comes to us that allows us to further our investigation , then we will certainly take the opportunity to do that			0
" according to local news reports at the time of @entity148 's disappearance , she was last seen leaning into a light blue car that she might have gotten into			1
a witness gave police a description of the man behind the wheel , which resulted in a sketch of a gray - haired man with glasses -- a drawing that journalist @entity160 says looks remarkably like @entity5			1
" he wears these wide - rim glasses			0
he was wearing those glasses back in the day and it 's also in the composite , " said @entity160 , whose book , " @entity162 , " chronicles @entity5 's life and run - ins with the law			1
" @entity5 apparently knew @entity129			2
@entity129 had volunteered at a homeless shelter in @entity122 , which @entity5 had frequented , which he had a habit of doing in different cities , " @entity160 said			2
he 'd also gone to a shoe store that @entity148 's aunt ran at a mall in @entity122 , @entity160 said			2
the former lead investigator on the case , @entity175 , retired several years ago and could not be reached for comment			0
in 2003 , he told @entity178 that there were similarities between @entity5 and the composite sketch			2
" he 's a lead we 're following , " @entity175 told the newspaper , " and with all the information we 've learned about him , i 'm not fully comfortable that i can eliminate him from our investigation at this point			0
" investigators looking at other cases across the country have their work cut out for them , @entity160 said			2
" in 2002 , when my book was first published , we reported that police found six addresses in the @entity24 alone			0
some of them were properties , some of them were post offices , some of them were warehouse facilities			0
there were other address in @entity206 , @entity25 , as well as other parts of the country , " he told @entity1 's " @entity209 : @entity210			0
" but the investigation is nothing new , he said			0
" they 've been looking at this for several years now , " he said			0
" i guess with recent events , they 've really expanded their scope			0
" @entity1 's @entity218 contributed to this report .			0
