around 2002 , i was browsing in a used book store in @entity3 , and there it was : " the ethics of @entity9 " by @entity6 and @entity7			1
coincidentally , i was working at that time on integrating ethics into engineering education at @entity12			1
i immediately bought the book , and after reading it through , realized that it could be the basis for an engaging course for our first - year engineering students			1
i first offered the course , @entity19 , in the fall of 2003 -- and i 've been teaching it ever since			1
my children grew up watching the shows that followed the original series , which continued the tradition established by " @entity9 " creator @entity25 of tackling current events like war , genocide and pollution			1
it was good family entertainment that also prompted reflection on issues of the day			1
and it was this exploration of both space and the issues of the day that inspired me to try to apply these moral lessons to students			1
first there was the friendship between @entity42 , mr. @entity43 , and @entity44 , aka bones			1
@entity46 described the human soul as composed of three aspects : spirit , reason and emotion			1
internally , we each strive to balance these three forces			1
if we manage to do this well , we become a more virtuous person and attain a fourth virtue : justice			1
by placing @entity42 ( spirit ) , @entity43 ( reason ) and bones ( emotion ) into challenging situations , we get to observe this interplay of these forces , and we get to hear them say what would otherwise be an internal dialogue			2
why is @entity43 so critical here ? because @entity68 worship logic and rationality			2
even though he 's half human , he suppresses his emotions			2
it 's no surprise that he is the science officer , since science is founded on rationality			2
mr. @entity43 , then , can be trusted to give reasoned scientific analysis in any situation , uninfluenced by emotion or spirit			2
and since they would n't even be in space without science , @entity43 may be the most important character for the success of the adventure			2
so , how was all this applied in a classroom ? the " @entity9 class " is a one - credit seminar for first - year students that meets once a week , one of about 60 different seminars offered by the @entity90			1
students read relevant chapters in the book , and then every other week we watch a related " @entity9 " episode			1
in the other weeks , we sit in a large circle and have an open and often lively discussion about the ethical ideas and their application to the students ' lives			2
one of the recurring plot elements in " @entity9 " is the discovery of new creatures			1
this often raises the question of the proper relationship and attitude toward these entities			2
are they intelligent ? is their intent malicious ? in one episode , " @entity121 , " the @entity113 engages in battle with an alien vessel , flown by the @entity117 , that has attacked an @entity120 colony			1
in the heat of the battle , another unknown species , the @entity121 , transports @entity42 and the @entity117 captain to a barren planet			2
they are told that because of their violent tendencies , they must battle to the death , with the ship and crew of the loser to be destroyed			2
as the two captains battle , the @entity121 project the scenes onto the @entity113 's main view screen on the bridge			2
as the crew observes the battle , and thinks more about it , @entity43 realizes that the @entity120 colony may have been the invader , and the @entity117 vessel may have been justified in its attack on the colony			0
@entity42 also begins to see this as a possibility			0
when he finally subdues the @entity117 captain , @entity42 decides to show him mercy and spare his life , even though it may result in the destruction of the @entity113 and her crew			0
surprised by this action , the @entity121 decide that there may be hope for humans after all , and that we are not primarily savages			0
this episode has been used in the following week 's discussion in various ways , depending on the current events that form the backdrop to the semester			1
one of my favorite approaches is to have the students consider the ethics of eating meat			0
i supplement the " @entity9 " background with arguments by other philosophers and commentators			1
it always makes for great discussion because the question hits home , literally , in the gut			0
at the heart of this question is : what is it about another creature that qualifies it for ethical consideration ? is it rationality ? is it power ? is it utility to humans ? many of the students ' arguments are essentially biological -- we are omnivores			0
they argue further that we are at the top of the food chain and can therefore do whatever we want			0
for these students , i often start by asking them if they have a pet			0
if they do , i ask them if i can eat their pet			0
or better yet , under what circumstances might it be ok to eat their pet ? a key issue that arises from this is that we humans see ourselves as more than just animals ; we have reason and a sense of right and wrong , a sense of justice			0
as the discussion evolves , various indicators of other species ' moral standing are investigated , including rationality , ability to experience pain and suffering , utility to humans , and perhaps that these other creatures have intrinsic value regardless of their use to people			1
often , students come away with a commitment to reduce animal suffering , and to reduce their consumption of meat overall			0
my favorite @entity43 - centered episode is a two - parter , " @entity236 , " which uses scenes from the original pilot , " @entity235			1
" here we see @entity43 's human side at its best			0
@entity238 , whom @entity43 used to serve with , has been injured to the point where he can live only as part of a machine , and he can only make a device beep once for yes , and twice for no. ( ok , admittedly it 's a flaw in the technological imagination			0
) @entity43 kidnaps @entity238 and commandeers the @entity113 , all for as yet unclear reasons			0
what we find out is that @entity238 and @entity43 had visited a planet ( in the pilot ) where aliens could make you experience any reality they dreamed up for you			0
they narrowly escaped , and the planet was placed off limits by the @entity254			0
@entity43 intends to deliver @entity238 to this planet so that he can live out his life in a reality unconfined by his physical impairment			0
along the way , @entity43 faces a court - martial where a guilty verdict would result in death			0
yet his loyalty and love of @entity238 override his awareness of the irrationality of his actions			0
( in the end , the court - martial is dropped , and @entity238 lives long and prospers			0
) nearly every episode had a moral lesson or dilemma like this , meaning that not only was " @entity9 " great entertainment , but a show that could really make you think			1
that 's why i was saddened to learn of @entity278 's passing friday			1
but it is also something that allows me to take some comfort , because i know that his legacy as mr. @entity43 , science officer of the starship enterprise , will live on .			0

" @entity9 " actor @entity278 died friday at age *83*
