the family of an unarmed biracial 19 - year - old killed by police in @entity4 , @entity5 , is pushing for peaceful protests online and in the streets			1
" our hands are stained with the blood of my nephew , and we are all left to deal with the aftermath , " @entity8 , the teen 's uncle , told reporters on monday			1
@entity8 stressed that his family was n't anti-police , but said @entity24 's death " highlights a universal problem with law enforcement and how its procedures have been carried out ... specifically as it pertains to the systematic targeting of young black males			1
" but he said the problem goes beyond the chants of " black lives matter " that have already been used at protests over the case			1
" i encourage everybody to show support regardless of race because this is truly a universal issue			2
... we do n't want to stop at just ' black lives matter , ' because all lives matter , " he said			1
the deadly confrontation has made @entity4 the latest epicenter of protests			2
here 's what we know about the friday night shooting			1
the incident started when authorities got a call that a black male was yelling and jumping in front of cars , madison police chief @entity43 said			1
dispatchers identified him as @entity24 , according to 911 audio obtained by @entity52			1
a little later , the dispatcher says , " apparently @entity24 hit one of his friends			1
" about four minutes later , the dispatcher says , " i got another call for the same suspect at [ the same address ]			2
he tried to strangle another patron			2
" about 30 seconds later , an unidentified officer says , " shots fired , shots fired			1
" when officer @entity66 went to the apartment , he heard some commotion and forced his way in , @entity43 said			1
" once inside the home the subject involved in this incident -- the same one allegedly out in traffic and that had battered someone -- assaulted my officer , " @entity43 said			1
after that , according to the chief , " the officer did draw his revolver and subsequently shot the subject			1
" @entity43 said it 's understandable why protesters are outraged			2
that 's going to make this all the more complicated for the investigators , the public , to accept , to understand ... why deadly force had to be used , " he said			2
a neighbor in the duplex said she heard it all happen			2
two brothers shared the other apartment in the duplex , and @entity24 was their friend , @entity91 said			1
" i heard rustling and things being knocked over and my kitchen ceiling actually kind of shook			2
... i figured something was going on , " she said			2
" i heard somebody go down the stairs			2
and then i heard the shots			2
" there were 4 - 6 shots fired , @entity91 said			2
for the family , that 's a horrifying reality			0
" it takes one bullet from a trained gunman to end a life			0
it takes one bullet , " @entity8 said monday			0
" and we know how many were fired			0
" this is n't the first time @entity66 used lethal force			0
in 2007 , he shot and killed a man in what the police chief described as a " suicide by cop			1
" @entity66 was exonerated of wrongdoing and received a commendation			0
during the confrontation friday night , @entity66 suffered a blow to the head , @entity43 said			1
he has been placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation			0
" it 's a stressful period for him and his family , but he also understands that a family here has suffered a tragic loss and he understands that there has to be an investigation , " said @entity128 , executive director of the @entity129			1
under @entity5 law , officer - involved shootings are investigated by an outside agency , in this case the @entity141			1
once the division completes its investigation , the report will go to the local district attorney , @entity43 said			0
@entity128 declined to comment on the ongoing investigation , but said there are some circumstances when an unarmed person could still be seen as posing a deadly threat to a police officer			1
" the real fear for any officer when he 's being attacked , generally speaking , is that their weapon will be taken away , " @entity128 said , " and an unarmed individual can become armed very quickly			1
" @entity159 documents indicate @entity24 pleaded guilty in december to an armed robbery that occurred last april			1
his mother , @entity162 , painted a different picture of the teen : " my son has never been a violent person , never , " she told @entity0 affiliate @entity52			0
" to die in such a violent way baffles me			0
" the police chief refused to comment on @entity24 's criminal history or run - ins with police			1
" i could but i choose not to , " he said at a press conference saturday			0
" i frankly think it is , for our purposes today , wholly inappropriate and i am not going to blemish anyone 's character , particularly someone 's as young as his			1
" on monday , @entity24 's uncle told reporters his nephew was n't a saint and had made some poor decisions , but was still a " good , kindhearted kid			1
" " we paint him as a human being , a 19 - year - old who made a terrible mistake at one point , which is completely dissociated from this act , " he said			1
@entity4 mayor @entity190 , who said he met with @entity24 's family the night of the shooting , said officials are n't going to put the teen on trial			1
" that 's not what this is about			0
what this is about is finding out exactly what happened that night and to determine , then , responsibility , " he told @entity0 's " @entity203			0
" " we know that he was not armed , and as far as the police chief and i are concerned ... the fact that @entity24 was involved in any kind of transgression in the past has nothing to do with this present tragedy			1
" because @entity24 did not have a weapon , the death spurred memories of other unarmed black men killed by police : @entity216 in @entity217 , @entity218			1
@entity219 in @entity220 , @entity221			0
over the weekend , protesters filled streets in @entity4			0
on monday , demonstrators packed the @entity225			0
they chanted and carried a banner with a familiar message : " black lives matter			2
" asked the difference between @entity217 and @entity4 , @entity8 said monday the cases are " similar , but different , " noting that his nephew 's " racial ambiguity " was an important part of his identity			0
" @entity24 's racial ambiguity reinforces the fact that @entity238 's racial lines are completely , 100 % blurred , " he said			1
" my sister is a white mother of black children who had black and white relatives			2
we are all multiple races and we each have our own complex heritage			0
" among the protesters are members of the @entity246 that was formed last summer after the @entity216 shooting in @entity217			2
the group wants more reactive policing in @entity250 - @entity238 neighborhoods , said group member @entity251			0
she said @entity4 police park on street corners in @entity250 - @entity238 neighborhoods and wait for something to happen , which leads to residents being hassled			0
that does n't happen in white neighborhoods , she said			0
" in light of so many things that have happened not just across the country , but in our own community , it 's understandable that the reaction at the scene and of some of our citizens is extremely volatile , emotional and upsetting , " @entity258 told @entity0 affiliate @entity52			0
" and we understand that			0
that 's absolutely appropriate under these circumstances			0
we would urge , obviously , that everyone exercise restraint			0
" @entity43 said he knows it may be difficult for @entity4 to move forward after @entity24 's death			1
he visited the teen 's grandmother over the weekend but was advised by them to not visit the mother yet because the emotions are still too raw			0
" we need to start , as any healing or any reconciliation should , with an ' im sorry , ' and i 've done that privately , and i 'm attempting to do that publicly and that 's the only way we can sort of begin the healing or the rift that may take years , if at all , to mend , " the police chief said			0
" but the effort has to be there			0
so we have to acknowledge it , we have to own it , we have to say we are sorry at the outset for it and then we have to show affirmative steps in moving forward to bring the community back into the fold , as it were			0
" @entity0 's @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity303 , @entity304 , @entity305 and @entity306 contributed to this report .			0
