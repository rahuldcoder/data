@entity0 no one knew him by his real name			2
but on the harsh streets of @entity6 that became his home , he was known as @entity8			1
surveillance footage , police and homeless community activists paint wildly different pictures of the man -- one who could be violent , benevolent , troubled and altruistic			1
@entity8 was shot and killed by @entity0 police sunday after he scuffled with officers			1
the shooting , caught on video , has renewed accusations of police brutality because it showed him already on the ground			2
police say he tried to reach for an officer 's gun			2
the @entity29 coroner 's office has identified @entity8 , but is not releasing his real name pending notification of relatives			1
@entity8 came to the @entity33 from the continent about a decade ago , said a friend who would only be identified as @entity36 like @entity8 , @entity36 had also been homeless on the streets of @entity6 -- a decrepit area wrought with poverty and despair			1
" he wanted to get away from here , he wanted to go back home , " @entity36 said			0
" he was very depressed			0
he had a good side to him , a good heart			0
" @entity8 kept a tent outside the @entity49 homeless shelter			1
even though the shelter was right in front of him , he did n't want the help			2
instead , @entity8 often helped the shelter 's employees			1
" our cleaning guys -- he would help them organize cleaning of ( the ) sidewalk , " said the rev. @entity55 , the shelter 's ceo			2
he described @entity8 as gentle and kind -- but with an erratic side			1
" i attribute the erratic behavior to this difficult environment out here			0
" less than an hour before he was killed sunday , a nearby security camera showed @entity8 apparently dealing drugs -- the sad and only real currency of @entity6 's economy			1
the footage then shows @entity8 getting into a fight with the man in the orange tent next to him , violently tipping the tent and kicking the man			1
police arrive and talk to @entity8 , but he jumps into the tent -- prompting officers to draw their guns			1
@entity8 then jumps out , swinging his arms at police			1
@entity0 police say he tried to grab an officer 's gun , and that 's when he was shot			0
@entity0 police chief @entity85 called the incident " an extreme tragedy			0
" " we feel great compassion in the @entity90 for people who live in conditions of homelessness , and often mental illness , with no treatment , " @entity85 said			0
" we prepare our officers to deal as best they can with them , but the reality is this is much more than a problem that the police alone can solve			0
" @entity101 said the dismal conditions of @entity0 's @entity6 makes it a tinder box for more problems			0
" there is no other major city in the @entity33 that has a skid row like ours , " he said			0
" 2,000 human beings living on the street			0
until we deal with that , we 're going to continue to have an explosive situation			0
" on the sidewalk where @entity8 was shot , a modest memorial sits atop a small pile of belongings			1
" @entity119 , " one cardboard sign reads " @entity120			0
" it 's unclear when the @entity29 coroner 's office will release @entity8 's real name			2
from there , it 's unclear where @entity8 's remains will go			2
@entity1 's @entity128 reported from @entity0 ; @entity129 reported and wrote from @entity130 .			0

the man known as @entity8 often helped employees at a homeless shelter
