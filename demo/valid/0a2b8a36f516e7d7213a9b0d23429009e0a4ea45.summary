if ignorance is bliss , then @entity1 must be a pleasure junkie , because we sure are chasing that dragon			1
the most recent example : a school in @entity9 sought to celebrate " @entity13 " by having the pledge of allegiance read in a different language every day			1
you get one guess as to what happened when it was @entity18 day			1
complaints came in from both @entity21 parents and people who had lost family in @entity24 , according to the school superintendent			1
what language do they speak in @entity24 ? not @entity18			1
the main languages are @entity29 and @entity30			1
perhaps this complaint illustrates why we need more education , not less			1
unfortunately , this was n't an isolated incident			2
earlier this year in @entity37 , parents were up in arms because a school taught about @entity40 in a history class			1
and , there are perennial stories about " @entity1 " offended by a @entity45 recitation of the pledge			2
because of the outcry , @entity48 students will now not hear the pledge in @entity50 , @entity45 , @entity51 , or @entity52 , as planned			1
that they were deprived of such a pedagogical exercise is bad enough			2
what is worse is that the school district felt that it had to apologize			1
the district 's statement was a surrender to ignorance			1
" the intention was to promote the fact that those who speak a language other than @entity66 still pledge to salute this great country			2
we sincerely apologize to any students , staff or community members who found this activity disrespectful			2
" instead of the @entity48 students learning about other languages and cultures , they learned that the " heckler 's veto " and phony tales of " offense " trump open mindedness and the quest for knowledge			2
at least they do in modern - day @entity1 education			1
perhaps this is a lesson best learned now , because once they get to college , it will be even worse			2
our universities were once places where ideas were safe to flourish , and we went to question what we knew			2
today , they are places where disfavored ideas are all but banned			0
according to students , @entity94 ( @entity95 ) bans posters that " mock " anyone , including former president @entity99			0
last year , @entity101 's president apologized and there was a student outcry because students had " hurt feelings " when alumna @entity106 argued at a panel discussion moderated by the college president against using the euphemism " the n - word " in historical discussions			1
she believed that using the actual word , in context , was proper ( and it is )			0
yes , censorship of ideas and speech is no longer a top - down or parent - driven phenomenon			0
now students themselves insist on being insulated from anything that might make them question their beliefs			0
instead of debating an anti-abortion protester , @entity126 students preferred to call the campus police -- who briefly took their side			0
@entity131 was slated to speak at @entity132 in a program specifically designed to challenge students ' prevailing views			0
but , since he challenged the feminist view of sexual assault on campus , @entity132 pulled his invitation			0
when i went to college , i enjoyed challenging my beliefs			0
i hope that my children constantly do the same			0
that is how we grow			0
if we can not tolerate foreign languages , or distasteful ideas , even in an educational setting , what hope do we have ? when we have orthodoxy of thought , the very notion of liberty begins to shrivel up and die			0
when the cry of " i 'm offended " can shut down debate over philosophies , or learning about other cultures , or learning other languages , then what have our educational institutions become ? how much further will this enforced ignorance and orthodoxy need to go before education is just another word that comes untethered from its meaning ? and the very inspiration for this column , a debate over the pledge of allegiance , makes the problem even more glaring			1
a rote and thought - free - chant of mindless allegiance ca n't even be expressed in a different language ? is @entity1 really so fragile that if a citizen proclaims " fidelit√† agli @entity178 " that it means anything less because it is in @entity50 ? perhaps this highlights more than the fact that we should step away from the brink of ignorance while we can			1
perhaps a good place to start is by doing away with enforced orthodoxy of thought and speech in the first place			0
perhaps a good place to do that would be by doing away with the pledge of allegiance itself			0
perhaps if we pledged to uphold the @entity194 , instead of a piece of cloth , we would be reminded of what really built this nation -- the spirit of the @entity200			0
no views are so sacred that they need not be challenged			0
whether we are talking about learning to say the @entity203 in @entity51 , or hearing a speaker who challenges our beliefs , that is what education is about , not enforced ignorance .			1

@entity9 school district *canceled* its *experiment* with the @entity203 for " @entity13 "
@entity213 says the outcry over an @entity18 version was a triumph of ignorance over education
