@entity0 yourself @entity3 -- " @entity4 " is coming to a football pitch near you			0
spend - thrift baseball executive @entity7 -- made famous by @entity10 's @entity9 - nominated portrayal in " @entity4 " -- is taking up a position with @entity13 club @entity12			1
" i 'm truly excited for the opportunity to be part of @entity12 in an advisory role , " @entity7 told the @entity12 website			1
" despite being a great football club with a storied history , they face many of the challenges we have with the @entity23 's			1
my love for football and @entity12 's vision of the future of the club made this an attractive pursuit			1
" the idea behind " @entity4 " is to obtain maximum value for each player bought or sold			0
@entity7 has had a longstanding fascination with @entity3 football , citing @entity37 's @entity36 as a manager he admires for his blend of performance on the pitch and financial prudence			1
the @entity43 has said in the past that it was his dream to be an executive at a football club once his baseball career ended			2
it turns out he did n't have to wait that long			0
" i think it 's interesting and exciting for him personally , " said @entity50 , co-founder of the sports analytics consultancy @entity52			2
" he 's been a football fan for many , many years and is very well informed about the sport and industry			0
this is not as much a stretch as one might imagine ; he actually knows football			0
" @entity7 will retain his general manager duties with the @entity23 's , a team that remains competitive despite sporting one of the lowest payrolls in @entity64 ( @entity64 )			1
the @entity23 's have qualified for @entity64 's playoffs each of the past three seasons , only to be knocked out before the @entity67 every time			1
critics of baseball 's sabermetrics system -- using data to analyze the sport as exposed in @entity74 ' " @entity4 " book which inspired the film -- are quick to point out that @entity7 has never won a title with the @entity23			1
in @entity77 , @entity7 wo n't need to start from scratch , as @entity12 currently sits comfortably in fourth place in the @entity13 @entity80			1
@entity12 's director of football @entity81 is a known " @entity4 " fan himself , having organized a screening for his fellow @entity12 execs shortly after joining the club			2
the former @entity43 midfielder , who scored against @entity88 in the 1994 @entity89 , is half - @entity13 and hopes the collaboration with @entity7 can give the club an extra edge			1
" we 've had a lot of contact with @entity7 in the last few months " , @entity81 told the club 's website			1
" his knowledge and ideas are impressive			0
also @entity7 's soccer network is excellent			1
we have already noticed that @entity7 thinks two steps ahead in the area of innovation			2
that 's what really connects with the ambitions of @entity12			0
" like the @entity23 , @entity12 have managed to compete with the big boys of the @entity13 league -- chiefly @entity108 and @entity109 -- on a limited budget , winning the domestic league twice -- most recently in 2009 -- while finishing in the top five in three of the past five seasons			1
@entity7 's philosophy is shaped by getting maximum bang for your buck in the transfer market			1
" there is a misconception that you never pay much for anybody , but that is not true at all , " @entity7 told the @entity119 in 2011			2
" you want to make sure you are getting more value than you are paying			0
that may come in the form of a very expensive player , it may come in the form of a very young player , but it 's not about being cheap or not spending money			0
" but it 's questionable whether " @entity4 " principles can be applied to football , a sport where -- unlike in @entity43 sports leagues -- players are rarely traded for one another			0
instead , athletes are sold for prices determined by a marketplace , untethered by salary caps			0
however , @entity50 argues @entity7 could be about to exploit a gap in the market			2
" i would say unequivocally that markets for players are much more inefficient in soccer than in baseball , " said @entity50 , who also wrote " @entity146 : everything you know about football is wrong			0
" " the combination of a global market plus inefficiency means that is a huge opportunity in soccer that there is n't in the same way in baseball			0
" either way , @entity7 is likely to relish the challenge of imparting his knowledge to the boardrooms of @entity3 football , perhaps even as a pre-cursor to a full time job in the sport			2
" i think he certainly would be open to the possibility of taking on a role , " said @entity50 , adding that @entity7 could be using the advisory position to dip his toe into the shark - infested waters of football player transfers			1
" in football we 're still in a pre- ' @entity4 ' era , " added @entity50			0
" so the baseball equivalent of the mid- 1990s			0
is the football equivalent of 2015			0
