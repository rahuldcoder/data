@entity0 @entity3 lawmakers are weighing a ban on extremely thin models			1
new legislation debated in @entity7 tuesday would require modeling agencies to get medical certificates from models proving that their body mass index is at least 18			2
models would also be required to undergo regular weight checks			2
and agencies that violate the law could face fines and even possible prison sentences			0
dr. @entity18 , a doctor and @entity3 lawmaker who 's proposing the measures , said it 's time to put a stop to the practice of pressuring models to be so thin that it 's dangerous for their health			1
" we want to combat the idea that an agency could urge a model to stop eating ; for example eating cotton balls to lose their appetite , to always lose more weight , " he said			1
seeing models ' bones as they parade down the catwalk is a troubling trend , @entity18 said			2
" we have had chief editors of prestigious magazines tell us that more and more often , they are obliged to use @entity43 , not to make the models look slimmer , " he said , " but to erase the tracks of bones under the skin , to make them look bigger			2
" @entity50 's proposed amendments to a health bill would also target the dark online world of pro-anorexia websites that promote self - starvation and encourage young women to post photos of their emaciated frames			0
the average @entity58 for a woman in @entity3 is 23.2 -- the lowest average in @entity61 , according to a 2009 study from @entity3 's @entity63			1
in @entity3 , @entity18 said , 30,000 - 40,000 people suffer from eating disorders , mainly teenagers			1
@entity67 , @entity3 's minister of social affairs , expressed her support for the new anti-anorexia measures in an interview with @entity1 affiliate @entity71			1
" the approach is good , " she said , adding that the government will have to examine the wording of the new legislation in further detail			0
extreme cases such as that of @entity3 model @entity79 have sparked calls for change for years			1
@entity79 died in 2010 , three years after she posed nude in a controversial ad campaign against anorexia			0
similar concerns in @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 prompted those countries to adopt laws against the use of ultra-thin models on catwalks and in advertising campaigns			1
@entity88 even has strict rules on how model 's bodies are photoshopped ; any changes must be clearly marked on the photo			1
some in the industry are supportive of the proposed laws , but say they do n't strike at the real issue			0
" the fact of the matter is , fashion creatives have to think about the messaging they are promoting around body image ideals and the fact they are normalizing an unachievable physical appearance , " said @entity104 , a fashion commentator			0
@entity18 's legislation is set to go before the @entity7 at the end of the month for discussion			0
and he wants to outlaw what he calls starving models by the end of the year			0
