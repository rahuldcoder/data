@entity0 worked hard last week to put the " dead end " sign on the @entity5 email story by announcing there was nothing to find			1
but in her rush to control the narrative , @entity8 may have ( once again ) missed the bigger picture : in politics as much as in business , authenticity matters			1
her press conference had the familiar ring of a controlled performance -- the carefully parsed explanation , the combative posture -- that stretched our belief that what she 's telling us is really the whole story			2
people wonder : is she playing it straight with us ? why the nagging suspicion that @entity29 does not include bringing to the public table who she really is ? as the author @entity33 reported in his classic book on the 1968 @entity36 campaign , " @entity37 of a president , " political consultants long ago began marketing candidates like bars of soap			0
the practice has accelerated since the ' 60s as campaigns have concluded that political brands face the same tests among voters that consumer brands do among customers			2
and among consumers today , authenticity means more to success than at any other time in the history of brands			1
the desire for authenticity is a tangible driver of revenue for brands			2
increasingly , people want to give their money to brands -- political as well as commercial -- that have a set of values they can also buy into			1
as author @entity67 told the @entity68 , a sense of authenticity reinforces trust in what is real " in an increasingly staged , contrived and mediated world			2
" a recent global study found that 63 % of consumers would buy a brand they perceive as authentic over its competitors , and more than 60 % would recommend an organization they perceive to be authentic			1
ignoring the importance of authenticity to voters is a significant risk , as both @entity85 and @entity86 learned too late			0
and they were running in a perceptual environment more forgiving than today 's			0
voters easily identified the space between who these candidates really were and how they wanted us to perceive them			0
@entity85 , the successful entrepreneur and moderate politician , struggled to seem ordinary and " severely conservative , " while @entity86 was perceived as having such an overblown sense of himself that the claim of having invented the @entity98 stuck to him like mud , even though he 'd never said it			1
the two shared what will likely also be @entity8 's destiny : winning a party nomination by default as there were few compelling alternatives			1
for @entity8 , an uncontested rise to the @entity110 nomination could mislead her campaign into believing that she does n't have a problem with authenticity			1
she does , especially among @entity115 and @entity116			0
to be fair , @entity8 's appeal as potentially the first woman to reach the @entity119 makes her seem virtually bulletproof among certain voting groups			1
a recent @entity121 shows " first female " status as the " best thing about a @entity0 presidency , " leading the positives mentioned by 30 % of @entity110 and 17 % of @entity115			1
but the next - closest best thing about @entity8 is a long way off : her experience is mentioned by only 16 % of @entity110 and 8 % of @entity115			2
a fledgling campaign apparatus , with powerful political recruits like @entity132 and @entity133 and marquee brand wizards from @entity135 and @entity136 , might want to be looking hard at the dangerously lukewarm voter sentiment about experience and suitability that is lingering just beneath the surface of the " first female president " juggernaut			2
part of the heightened danger coming out of her press conference lies among millennials , who will be a critical voting group for @entity110 in the 2016 presidential election			0
and authenticity is of paramount importance to millennials in how they relate to everything in their lives , including politicians			0
as one commenter on a @entity161 article on millennials put it , " if brands ca n't be authentic @entity157 will call them on it			1
want to win our hearts ? a little self - deprecation and humility never hurt			0
" forty percent of millennials in the @entity168 admit to full - blown cynicism about the way they are approached by brands of all kinds			0
according to the @entity161 article , authenticity and the allied trait of trustworthiness are two of the top brand attributes millennials look for before they make a decision to hand over their money and , one could argue by extension , their vote			0
these days , too , it 's trickier than ever for brands to stay in step with the conversations that move people to make judgments			0
whether they 're consumers or voters , people are more in tune with each other than at any other time in human history			0
they can gang up more easily to support or reject a person , an idea , and , yes , a company , brand or politician			0
brands are left on the outside looking in , puzzling out how to insert themselves into a meaningful relationship with constituents who can turn on them at any second			0
this trend of demanding more authenticity from brands they invest in , and rewarding brands for it , has been accelerating with consumers across the @entity168 over the course of the very same seven years since @entity8 last ran for president			1
since consumers are also voters , it stands to reason that any political brand -- including @entity0 -- should look even more seriously today at how to increase its value by focusing on perceptions of its authenticity .			1

@entity225 : @entity0 struggled last week to put the email story behind her
@entity225 : consumers are increasingly valuing brands perceived as authentic . does the @entity8 brand *qualify* ?
