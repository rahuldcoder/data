he 's a @entity2 footballer who honed his game in his parents ' garage			1
and even at the age of 40 , former @entity7 star @entity6 is still purring along , showing no signs of running out of gas			1
the record - breaking striker is currently enjoying an indian summer to his football career , completing stints at @entity15 in @entity16 and more recently at the @entity17 in the inaugural @entity18			1
inevitably , the time will come when he finally decides to hang up his boots but that does n't look like happening anytime soon -- not when he 's still enjoying himself so much			1
" about football , i love every single moment -- the life with teammates , the atmosphere before a game , the free kicks , the goals			1
i love every moment like the first one , " @entity6 told @entity1 's @entity31 series			2
the man dubbed " @entity35 " ( " the little artist " ) has enjoyed a glittering career for both country and club in @entity40			1
during 19 seasons at @entity7 he won 15 trophies including six @entity44 crowns and a @entity46 title , as well as setting club records for appearances and goals			1
in all , @entity6 made 705 appearances for the @entity7 -- including a record 478 in @entity44 -- and scored 289 goals along the way			1
" i 'm very proud about the records because i do everything for the club			2
i 've had some great moments with the club , with the fans ( and ) with my teammates , " he says			2
raised in the town of @entity63 in northern @entity40 , @entity6 's love for football was fostered by his late father , @entity64			2
" my childhood was fantastic			2
i trained and played every moment and in every space of my home , " he recalls			2
" you know northern @entity40 is very cold -- you can not play outside , so my father would move the car out of the garage to give me more space			0
i would play alone , with my schoolmates and try to imagine in my mind what it means to be a footballer			0
" @entity6 turned professional at the age of 17 , joining @entity84 side @entity82 in 1991 before being snapped up by @entity7 for â‚¬ 2.6 million two years later			1
his longstanding relationship with the " @entity7 , " as @entity7 is affectionately known , got off on the right foot almost from the start			1
@entity6 scored five times in 11 appearances in his debut season before making his breakthrough the following year , becoming a first - team regular standing in for injured star striker @entity94			1
the two men would go on to share a dressing room at international level , with both netting 27 times for their country , but their defining moments for the @entity40 could not have been more contrasting			0
while @entity94 will forever be remembered for missing a penalty kick that handed @entity103 victory in the 1994 @entity105 final , @entity6 has cause to reflect on happier times on football 's biggest stage			1
after being part of two unsuccessful campaigns in 1998 and 2002 , @entity6 and @entity40 hit the jackpot in 2006 in @entity112 , beating @entity113 on penalties in a final remembered primarily for @entity116 's headbutt on @entity40 defender @entity117			1
victory in the final was a " beautiful " moment but @entity6 's most cherished memory of that tournament happened a few days earlier			0
" the most special moment in my head , and probably the heads of my teammates , was the semifinal , " he says			2
" definitely the final , when you take the cup and lift it to the sky , it 's beautiful			0
but the semifinal was the most exciting			1
we played the home team for 120 minutes			0
there is a big connection between our two countries			0
" an epic battle looked to be heading for penalties after a goalless 90 minutes , with extra time going the same way , before @entity141 netted in the 119th minute followed by a @entity6 effort moments later			0
" i ca n't hide that my greatest victory is the @entity105			1
since you 're a kid you think you want to win that			0
it was massive , " he says			0
@entity40 's third @entity105 triumph came against a backdrop of turmoil in @entity40 's domestic league as @entity7 and other @entity44 teams were implicated in the " @entity155 " match - fixing scandal			1
the repercussions would see former @entity7 managing director @entity157 banned for life by the @entity160 football authorities while the club was stripped of two @entity44 titles won in 2005 and 2006 , relegated to @entity84 and docked nine points			1
the demotion to @entity40 's second tier saw some top players leave the club , including @entity40 captain @entity168 , @entity113 defender @entity169 and @entity171 striker @entity170			2
but the ever - faithful @entity6 stayed put , helping @entity7 secure the @entity84 title and an immediate return to the top flight			1
" i think that staying with @entity7 in @entity84 , even before i knew how large the points penalty was going to be , was the best decision i could 've made , " @entity6 said last year			1
" i had an extraordinary season that gave extra meaning to everything that came afterwards , including the ( @entity44 ) trophy i lifted on the last game at the @entity182			2
" @entity6 also scored in that final league match against @entity184 in may 2012 and was afforded a hero 's send - off with a 20 - minute standing ovation after his substitution in the second half			0
" there were many people crying that day			0
i tried to hide my tears by bowing down to pick up some scarfs and cleaning my eyes			0
it was a very special and touching moment ... it will stay with me forever , " he recalls			0
a open letter to @entity7 ' fans confirmed his exit the following july before signing a two - year deal to play for @entity15 in @entity16 's @entity200 in a deal worth aus $ 4 million ( $ 3 million )			1
he was soon helping repay that fee , netting a trademark free kick on his home debut -- one of 24 goals scored during his time @entity208			0
@entity6 has since gone on to help promote the new @entity18 , appearing in the inaugural competition late last year			0
so what plans does the veteran have for 2015 ? " my future plan is to find a good restaurant tonight and have a rest and then tomorrow is another day , " he says cheekily before suggesting that his playing days may not be over just yet			2
" i have two or three situations to analyze			0
i want to take some time to make a good decision like i did in the past , " he adds			0
" i would love to play again , i want to play with good people around me			0
i 'm still training now -- i want to keep myself ready for a big decision			0
" watch this space .			0
