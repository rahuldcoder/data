five full weeks into @entity3 's murder trial , prosecutors have called 77 witnesses			1
jurors have yet to hear from the former @entity8 star 's fianc√©e , @entity6 , @entity9 head coach @entity6 or owner @entity10			2
but this week did bring emotional testimony and important developments in the case against @entity3 , who has pleaded not guilty to killing @entity14 in 2013			1
check out some of the key moments you might have missed this week			2
a dna analyst from the @entity19 crime lab said she found that @entity3 's dna matched the dna taken from a marijuana joint found near @entity14 's body at the crime scene			1
@entity14 's dna also was found on the blunt			2
the dna analyst , @entity26 , testified to finding a partial dna match from @entity3 on the shell casing found in the dumpster of the enterprise rental car office			1
but under cross-examination , lead defense attorney @entity31 got @entity26 to acknowledge there 's a high likelihood that dna from chewing gum could have transferred to the shell casing found in the dumpster			2
the office manager at the rental car office , @entity39 , testified that she put the shell casing and the gum together after finding the items in the @entity43 returned by @entity3 on june 17 , 2013			1
she said she threw them in the trash bin outside of her office			0
inside @entity3 's downward spiral it was revealed by @entity31 that the state never submitted the gum for dna testing			1
the state has not yet explained why			0
we may hear the answer during the state 's redirect of @entity26 on monday			0
@entity3 is seen on surveillance video buying gum , and he also offered some to @entity39			1
@entity26 said under cross-examination that it 's highly unlikely to find @entity24 on any shell casing			0
one reason is because the heat from the gun wipes away any dna , she said			2
the shell casings found at the crime scene did not have enough dna on them to produce a dna profile			2
@entity3 's family was in court on friday after a week 's absence			1
@entity3 's mother , @entity72 , told @entity1 ' that she thought friday " went very well " for him			1
testimony this week also focused on fingerprints from @entity3 and @entity14 that were found inside the rented @entity43			1
the car also had fingerprints of @entity77 and @entity78 , who are also charged with killing @entity14			2
they have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately			0
state trooper @entity80 , a fingerprint expert with the @entity19 crime scene services , reported finding the fingerprints of @entity77 and @entity78 in a @entity84 300 that @entity3 rented			1
prosecutors call it the " getaway car , " which was ultimately found abandoned in @entity88 , @entity89			0
but no prints were found on the .22 - caliber gun recovered on the edge of a wooded area near @entity3 's home			1
@entity3 is charged with illegal possession of that gun			1
in addition , no prints were found on any of the shell casings , including the casing found stuck to the blue bubblegum in the dumpster outside the @entity103 office			0
another key find : tire treads of the rear passenger tire of the @entity43 matched a tire impression found at the crime scene , according to court testimony			1
@entity110 , @entity14 's younger sister and the last family member to see him before he was killed , took the stand monday			0
about an hour before his death , she said she watched him get into a silver @entity43 as she sat in a friend 's car outside her home			0
@entity110 , who was 19 at the time of her brother 's killing , told jurors that when @entity14 first walked to the car , he opened the front passenger door			2
he stopped and then opened the back passenger door and entered the car			0
" the light came on and there was a shadow in the back seat , " she said			0
then she saw the @entity43 pull away			0
it was 2:32 a.m. thirty minutes later , @entity110 returned to her home and charged her dead phone			2
she noticed a text from her big brother			0
@entity110 was not allowed to share with jurors what was said in those texts			2
the judge ruled there is not enough proof the text message meant @entity14 feared for his life , legally called " a dying declaration			0
" that means that the jury did not hear that at 3:07 a.m. , @entity14 texted his sister asking , " u saw who i 'm with ? " at 3:11 a.m he checked in again , texting " hello			0
" finally , at 3:19 a.m. @entity110 answered , " my phone was dead who was that ? " at 3:22 a.m. , @entity14 responded , " @entity8			2
" a minute later , he sent his last text , " just so u know			0
" during grand jury testimony , @entity110 admitted she thought her brother was bragging			2
when reliving the moment when police came to her home to tell her family that @entity14 had been shot to death , @entity110 began to cry silently , wiping her tears after assistant district attorney @entity159 gave her a tissue			0
during cross-examination , defense attorney @entity161 introduced a photo of @entity14 taken by @entity110			0
it showed @entity14 smiling and sitting in the driver 's seat of the black @entity167 that @entity3 loaned him			1
on wednesday , jurors got an up - close view of the clothes @entity14 was wearing the night he was shot six times			2
@entity174 crime lab forensic chemist @entity172 held up @entity14 's bullet - riddled dark blue @entity176 sweatshirt and then his red plaid shirt			0
jurors craned their necks to get a better view of the bullet holes in the sweatshirt			2
the shirt was stained with blood			0
@entity185 tested the bullet holes for gunshot residue consisting of what she described as burned particles and vaporous lead			0
during her testing of bullet holes on the front of the sweatshirt , she found both and was able to determine that @entity14 was shot from as close as 3 feet			0
the autopsy showed the final two shots were fired into his chest while he was laying face up in the ground			0
just weeks before @entity3 was arrested and charged with murder , he toured rental apartments with @entity9 employee @entity205 , real estate agent @entity206 testified thursday			1
she said she was initially contacted by @entity205 to find some apartments to show @entity3			1
he had previously called her to help other @entity9 players find homes and apartment rentals , sometimes second residences near @entity212			0
this means the @entity9 staff knew about @entity3 's second home			1
in early may of 2013 , she showed @entity205 and @entity3 four apartments			1
@entity3 settled on the two - bedroom condo in @entity218 , @entity174 , referred to as his " flophouse			1
" @entity3 's home in @entity221 and his condo in @entity218 are each about 15 minutes away from the stadium			1
@entity3 's @entity218 neighbor , @entity224 , also took the stand , telling jurors that she met another man that also stayed in the condo			1
it was @entity3 's friend @entity77			1
@entity224 paid close attention to @entity3 and @entity77 , seeing them come and go during their short stay there			1
during her one attempt to talk to @entity3 and say hello , she says he sort of grunted back , calling it a " nondescript " noise			1
she also testified that she often heard loud voices that sounded " locker room - ish " coming from the apartment as well as a strong " skunk - like " smell seeping into her apartment from their shared wall			2
after mid-june , she never saw him again			0
a representative from @entity249 , @entity248 , started off the week with a light moment			0
he appeared nervous and stopped to take a moment while answering a question			0
he then turned to judge @entity253 and apologized			0
" it 's a big case			0
" showing no emotion , @entity253 struck the comment from the record			0
@entity248 went on to testify to multiple calls between @entity249 cell phone client @entity77 and @entity14 , @entity3 and @entity3 's fiancee , @entity6 , the night before and morning of @entity14 's death			1
prosecutors say they believe @entity3 was using his fiancee 's phone to call @entity77			1
@entity6 granted immunity @entity248 also explained how cell sites ( or towers ) in the @entity249 network tracked the phone calls , and thus tracked the direction they were driving			1
another cell phone representative also testified			1
@entity274 engineer @entity273 testified about the data transmissions from @entity14 's cell phone beginning on june 17 , 2013 , at 2:32 a.m. that 's when @entity14 was picked up outside his home in the @entity43			1
data transmissions are the automatic updates that are sent to cell phones			0
assistant district attorney @entity282 methodically walked @entity273 through data transmissions received on @entity14 's cell phone via multiple cell towers along the route he traveled from @entity287 to the industrial park in @entity221			1
the last cell tower was just 400 yards from @entity14 's body .			0

mother tells @entity298 that court " went very well " for @entity3
