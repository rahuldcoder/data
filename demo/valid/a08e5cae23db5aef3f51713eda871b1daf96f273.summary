in his writings , author @entity0 yearned for reason and humanism guided by science			1
he had no place for religious dogma , including from @entity8 , the main religion of his native @entity10			1

on thursday , someone did			2
as usual , @entity0 defied the threats and departed his home in suburban @entity20 for @entity21 , where he appeared at a speaking engagement about his latest books -- one of them titled " @entity25			1
" he has written seven books in all			2
as he walked back from the book fair , assailants plunged machetes and knives into @entity0 and his wife , killing him and leaving her bloodied and missing a finger			1

" investigators are proceeding on the notion that @entity0 's murder was an extremist attack			1

no one came to their aid as they were hacked down , a witness said			2

" but at night , secularist sympathizers marched through a street holding torches ; by day , others held a sit - in to protest @entity0 's killing			1
the government condemned the attack			0
who was the software engineer , a @entity16 citizen from @entity68 , @entity69 , who drew such rage from some and adoration from others ? @entity74 was his career , but writing and blogging were his calling			0
and he did not speak alone			0

" its mission was to promote science , secular philosophy , democracy and religious tolerance in articles by academics and activists			2

" to the most devout and to extremists , @entity0 's criticisms amounted to blasphemy			1
he took aim at the sentiment in a blog post headlined , " @entity125 , @entity124			0
' " some who felt oppressed by religion said he spoke for them			0
" @entity0 , your voice of reason and your passion for free thinking will never die			1
you were a voice to so many voiceless , " a fan wrote after his death			0
@entity0 and the blog 's other critics took off the gloves when it came to religion , particularly @entity8			1
@entity0 was a fan of @entity144 's harsh reproach of @entity8 and a critic of @entity146 , who has countered @entity144 's standpoint			1
his blog called @entity146 " an @entity8 apologist , who obviously feels threatened by the growing @entity151 movement in the @entity16 and worldwide			2
" @entity0 likened women in burkas to " living zombies , " tweeting out a cartoon of one standing next to a child dressed as a ghost for @entity157			1

" he doled out scathing criticism after another @entity10 blogger was hacked to death outside his home in 2013 by assailants with machetes			0
" the virus of faith was the weapon that made these atrocities possible , " @entity0 wrote			1
but he also criticized @entity178			0
" so , @entity179 thinks ' evolution is real ' ! and it is still a major headline news in this century , " he recently tweeted			0
to @entity0 , @entity182 was an outdated notion			1
@entity0 sought enlightenment in doubt , criticism and reason			1
question everything , was a theme in his online posts			0
never think you 've found the truth			0
he was a science geek who admired @entity195 , evolutionary psychology and astrophysics , according to a @entity199 account in his name			0
@entity2 could not independently verify it belongs to him			0
@entity0 was a fan of " @entity201 , " the tv series explaining the science behind the origin of the universe , and of the geek sitcom " @entity207			1
" @entity80 contains sections titled " science " and " rationalism , " but most of the articles hold science up to religion as a litmus test , which it invariably fails			0
" to me , it is a rational concept to oppose any unscientific and irrational belief , " @entity0 said			1
he regularly attended a february book fair in the @entity10 capital , and last year , after he launched " @entity25 , " the death threats began streaming in			0
they landed in his email inbox and cropped up on social media			0
" a well - known extremist ... openly issued death threats to me through his numerous @entity199 statuses , " @entity0 wrote			1
his book " hit the cranial nerve of @entity8 fundamentalists , " @entity0 wrote			1

but is seemed the author was safe in @entity68			0
" @entity0 lives in @entity16 and so , it is not possible to kill him right now			1
but he will be murdered when he comes back , " the @entity35 wrote , according to @entity0			2
he could n't let that stop him , @entity0 's friend @entity240 said			2
" @entity0 was very idealistic , " he said			2

" he never had a chance to			0
