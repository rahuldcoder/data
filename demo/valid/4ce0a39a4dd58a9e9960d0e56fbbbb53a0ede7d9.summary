@entity0 the initial hours after the disappearance of flight mh370 were characterized by confusion and chaos , as air traffic controllers struggled to comprehend the situation and radar operators failed to take notice , according to data contained in an interim report			1
the report -- released one year after the disappearance of the @entity14 and its 239 passengers and crew --- provides a detailed picture of delays and protocol violations before the launch of the search and rescue			1
an astonishing five hours and 13 minutes passed between the last communication from the flight crew and @entity0 's first distress signal concerning the missing plane			1
and it was another five hours before the first search flights took off to try to find it			1
@entity1 's aviation correspondent @entity30 said he believes the delayed response was the most disturbing thing revealed by the interim report -- " the lack of somebody pushing the big red button that says crisis and panic			1
" a year later after the plane 's disappearance , not a single trace of @entity42 has been found despite extensive search efforts			1
investigators believe the wreckage lies somewhere on the bottom of the @entity47 , based on the analysis of satellite communications data			0
the first sign that something was wrong with flight mh370 came after plane failed to check in with @entity55 @entity54 after leaving @entity57 airspace			2
according to protocol , @entity58 should have informed their @entity0 counterparts ( @entity61 ) about this within five minutes			0
when @entity64 finally did inform @entity0 , the confusion was evident , as seen in transcripts of the conversation released sunday			0
@entity67 asked three times at what point @entity64 lost contact , then went on to express concern at the delay , asking " why you did n't tell me first ? within five minutes you should be ( sic ) called me			0
" the confusion only got worse after @entity76 mistakenly told @entity0 @entity54 they could see the flight somewhere over @entity78			2
it took an hour and a half to clear this up , after @entity76 admitted to controllers they were only looking at the projected flight track			2
@entity76 ceo @entity84 said the misinformation was a momentary lapse by a company employee			0
" our information was only to be as a guide			0
we are not an atc per se			0
we do n't have radar , " he told @entity1			0
the watch supervisor then waited another two hours to activate the rescue coordination center			0
still another hour went by before before @entity0 issued the distress signal			0
no explanation for the delay is given in the interim report , which is composed of factual data and provides no conclusions or recommendations			1
after the air traffic controllers lost contact with @entity42 , the plane continued to fly within the range of multiple radar systems belonging to four different countries			1
yet little seems to have been done with the data in the immediate hours after the plane disappeared			2
the interim report says that " for unknown reasons " @entity113 's @entity112 did not see the flight			1
and @entity117 " did not pay much attention , " since @entity42 's flight path did not fall within its borders			1
@entity57 military radar tracked the flight for an additional hour , including its turn back across the @entity123			0
despite this information , search and rescue teams did not begin expanding the search area for a full day			0
though the interim report makes no mention of it , a failure by the @entity57 military to alert others to the relevant radar data may be blame			1
a briefing document prepared by the @entity136 ( @entity136 ) said military authorities failed to share the final radar fix of @entity42 with their civilian counterparts for 20 hours			1
@entity1 approached @entity57 's @entity140 for comment but is yet to receive a response another working document notes that @entity42 's turn back might have been discovered much earlier , if the military and non-military agencies had coordinated better			2
" in essence , a week or more was lost in the initial search because of poor civil / military cooperation , " reads the @entity136 working document			0
the interim report released by @entity57 investigators on sunday provides no information about when the military radar data was shared with other authorities			1
it 's impossible to know if a speedier response from air traffic controllers , or more immediate access to radar data , would have changed the course of events for @entity42			2
but it would have provided authorities with more time , either to track the flight or to search the ocean before the batteries died in the emergency locator beacons			2
looking back at the series of miscommunication between air traffic controllers and the radar lapses also provides valuable lessons that could help future search and rescue operations			0
though the @entity42 investigation team did not draw lessons in the current report , it plans to provide safety recommendations in the months ahead			1
journalist @entity179 contributed to this report .			0
