it may not provide the answer to life , the universe and everything , but when the @entity3 at @entity5 's @entity4 starts up again this month , particle physicists are planning to give this question their best shot			1
having finally nailed down the elusive @entity13 boson particle in 2013 -- the elementary particle that has unlocked some of the universe 's longest - standing secrets -- physicists are now on the trail of dark matter			1
and with the @entity3 ( @entity3 ) -- the 27km ( 17 mile ) circumference particle accelerator that occupies a tunnel on the @entity26 - @entity25 border -- now tricked out with new magnets , more powerful energy beams and a tighter vacuum , scientists are hoping to shine a light on some of the universe 's more arcane phenomena			1
" @entity13 was the final piece of the jigsaw of what we call the @entity39 of particle physics , " dr @entity33 , operations group leader at the facility , told @entity7			1
" but we know that this model is not complete			2
" " one of the big things we know is out there -- but we do n't yet understand -- is dark matter			1
" there 's a lot of astronomical observations to support the fact that this stuff exists , so this is one thing that we might hope shows up			2
" dark matter is currently a hypothesis			1
it is a type of matter that ca n't be seen but whose presence can be inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter , radiation and even the very structure of the universe			1
physicists believe this unseen material makes up about 85 percent of all the matter in the universe			1
regular matter , which we are made of along with all the stars , planets and other tangible cosmic material , accounts for just around 4 percent of the mass - energy of the known universe			1
in other words , the vast majority of what constitutes reality still eludes us			2
particle physicists will no doubt be on the edge of their seats when the new souped - up collider is put through its paces this month , although it can take months for the data to be processed			1
" there are a number of theories that give you dark matter candidates -- one of the favourites is supersymmetry , " @entity33 said , adding that the team got no sign of it at all in the facility 's first three - year run			1
" what the physicists are hoping is that with the step up in energy we will be able to explore a bit more of parameter space and that something dramatically new will show up			1
" if it does , it 's @entity107 prizes all around ; it really will be a major breakthrough			0
if it 's not , then it 's back to the drawing board			0
" the increased energy of the new collider will be key to the new studies			0
the energy of collisions in the @entity3 in 2015 will be 13 @entity114 ( teraelectron volt ) compared with 8 tev in 2012 during its last run			1
while the facility is a big industrial user of power -- about @entity121 when it 's running at full tilt -- it 's not quite powerful enough to dim the lights or send the air - conditioning down in surrounding areas			1
" we have a dial that tells us how much energy we 're using - it would be equivalent to about 10 % of the total power in the @entity5 canton , " @entity33 said			2
but anyone expecting a " @entity137 " scenario of flashing lights and crackling electrical discharges is going to be disappointed			0
according to @entity33 , while the machine is tremendously powerful , it operates within a vacuum , making it relatively quiet			0
" the beam itself does hum , we can hear it oscillating , but the collision energy between one proton and another -- while it 's a huge amount of energy for a proton -- is like a house fly hitting another house fly at 5 miles per hour			0
" the beam , however , does have a huge amount of energy and we have to be very careful with it			0
" he said the proton beam is launched at a tangent to the ring and when the energy of the beam needs to be absorbed , they use a graphite block to damp it			0
" now that really does give a good bang , " @entity33 said			0
" we had microphones down there and this you could hear			0
" while there are billions of protons per package sent hurtling through the collider at a rate of 11,000 times per second , only 20 or 30 protons per package will actually collide to produce an effect that can be studied			0
@entity176 must monitor equipment that registers hundreds of millions of collisions per second typically over 12 - hour periods			2
" the experiments need this because the interesting stuff like the @entity13 is extremely rare			0
only very rarely do these collisions produce something interesting and this is the big challenge for us -- to trigger the interesting stuff , " he said			0
the @entity13 may have gone a long way to answering the questions thrown up by the @entity39 , but @entity33 says there will still be plenty of good physics to be examined by what is effectively the world 's biggest machine			0
" we 're planning a major upgrade in 2023 - 25 -- there 'll be new more powerful focusing magnets installed and some other upgrades and this will allow us to multiply by five the number of collisions we can deliver			1
" that program is planned out until 2035 ... there are some interesting milestones coming up			0
" he remains sanguine , however , about the possibility that after weeks of collisions and months and sometimes years of study , scientists and researchers may have actually moved further away from answering the mysteries and paradoxes of particle physics beyond the @entity39			2
" maybe the universe is a bit simpler than we think it is , " @entity33 said			2
read more from @entity219 , @entity220 : behold the ' @entity221 ' you will you soon be able to ' swallow the doctor ' the end of electronics as we know it ?			0

the @entity3 , a 27km ( 17 mile ) particle accelerator , is ready to fire up again after a two - year upgrade
after nailing down the elusive higgs boson particle in 2013 , physicists are now on the trail of dark matter
dark matter has never been observed , but it makes up nearly 85 percent of all the matter in the universe
