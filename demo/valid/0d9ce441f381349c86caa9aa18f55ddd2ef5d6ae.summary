@entity2 @entity0 , the @entity4 - @entity3 fighter the world knows as " @entity6 , " was fuming with righteous indignation when he met with a representative of @entity9 -- a @entity11 advocacy group now known as @entity12 -- shortly after being deported from @entity13 in august 2009			1
in a meeting recorded by the advocacy group , he claimed his plans for a safari vacation were ruined when he was detained at the airport and sent back first to @entity18 and then to @entity19 , @entity20 , where he was subjected to several interrogations by @entity4 security officials			2
he said they accused him of traveling to @entity13 so he could link up with the terrorist group @entity24 in neighboring @entity25 and revealed they had been listening in on his phone conversations even before he made the trip			2
@entity0 said that during the questioning he denied any connection to extremism and stated that innocent people had been killed in the 2005 @entity2 transport system terrorist attacks and that the 9/11 terror attacks in the @entity35 were wrong			1
father : no proof my son is ' @entity6 ' but more than a dozen @entity4 administrative court documents obtained by @entity1 paint a very different picture of @entity42 and explain why he was on @entity4 security services ' radar before he made the trip			1
the documents reveal @entity4 security services believed @entity0 was part of a radical @entity2 recruitment network for terrorist groups in @entity52			1
last week , two @entity35 officials and two @entity35 congressional sources confirmed to @entity1 that " @entity6 " is @entity0 , a @entity55 - born londoner			2
one figure in the group -- a 30 - year - old @entity56 identified only as " ce " who was allegedly trained by @entity61 terrorists in @entity25 in 2006 -- was later placed under a " control order , " a @entity4 administrative measure to restrict the freedom of movement of terror suspects			1
a december 2011 court document pertaining to @entity58 's case named @entity0 as part of his extremist network			1
according to the document , @entity4 home secretary @entity87 may " maintained she has reasonable grounds for suspicion that since his return to the @entity4 in february 2007 , @entity58 has continued to associate regularly with members of a network of @entity4 and @entity52 - based @entity77 extremists which is involved in the provision of funds and equipment to @entity25 for terrorism - related purposes and the facilitation of individuals ' travel from the @entity4 to @entity25 to undertake terrorism - related activity			1
the secretary of state maintains that members of the network include @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity0 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 and others			0
" some of these men are now dead			0
@entity58 told @entity4 officials that @entity94 and @entity0 often stopped by his wife 's apartment			1
several of the visits were in early 2011 , according to the document			0
many of the young men in this network grew up within a few blocks of @entity42 in @entity2			2
according to the court documents , security services believe five members of the group -- @entity58 , @entity100 , @entity90 , @entity116 , @entity95 and @entity93 -- attended an @entity61 training camp in @entity25 in 2006 in which they may have been instructed in the use of explosives			1
the camp was run by two veteran @entity61 operatives , @entity122 and @entity123 , who instructed the @entity4 group to return to the @entity4 " to carry out facilitation activities and to recruit individuals to work on behalf of @entity61 and / or @entity24 , " according to the @entity4 government			2
@entity122 and @entity123 were the most - wanted @entity61 operatives in @entity52 and , according to a 2009 @entity130 cable , their training camps offered far more advanced instruction than that offered by @entity24			0
@entity122 , a @entity134 operative , was suspected of playing a key operational role in the bombing of the @entity137 in @entity138 , @entity134 , in 1998 , as well as a bomb attack on a resort in @entity141 in 2002 , and on the same day , a failed missile attack on an @entity144 airliner taking off from @entity141 's airport			0
@entity123 , who was born on the @entity146 , was also suspected of playing a key role in the bombings of @entity35 embassies in @entity52 in 1998			0
he wrote in a 2009 memoir that @entity152 recruits should be provided with training rather than instantly dispatched as suicide bombers within @entity25 " to build sleeping cells around the world			2
" @entity122 was killed in a @entity158 raid in september 2009 and @entity123 was killed in an ambush in @entity160 in june 2011			0
authorities recovered a document on a thumb drive found on his body -- probably authored by a @entity4 recruit -- proposing an attack on targets including @entity169 and the five - star @entity171 and @entity172 hotels in the @entity4 , similar to the 2008 @entity173 , @entity174 , attacks that killed more than 160 people			2
the author proposed two months ' training in @entity25 for @entity4 and @entity152 recruits selected for the attack , including target reconnaissance , hostage - taking , weapons and counter-surveillance			1
according to the court documents , at least one member of @entity0 's circle -- @entity91 , a 36 - year - old @entity189 asylum seeker to the @entity4 -- had links to the @entity61 cell that attempted to bomb the @entity2 transport system on july 21 , 2005 , two weeks after bomb blasts on @entity195 trains and buses killed 52 people and wounded 770			1
according to the @entity4 government , @entity198 , a @entity199 convert to @entity201 known in @entity77 circles as @entity203 , contacted bomber @entity204 by phone on the morning of the july 21 attempted attack			2
in october 2009 , two months after @entity0 's alleged aborted attempt to wage jihad possibly in @entity25 , three members of his west @entity2 network -- @entity100 , @entity211 and @entity212 -- traveled to join the terrorist group @entity24 in @entity25 , according to the documents			1
@entity4 security officials estimate that a total of more than 100 @entity4 extremists traveled to join the group , according to published reports			0
the @entity220 - born @entity100 , from @entity221 in @entity2 , swiftly rose to a senior position in @entity24 and likely continued to work closely with the senior @entity61 operative @entity123 , according to a profile by @entity225 , the director of international security studies at the @entity227			0
according to the @entity4 court documents , @entity100 remained in contact with the radical network he and @entity0 belonged to in the @entity4 while in @entity25			1
@entity100 and @entity211 were killed in @entity35 drone strikes in early 2012			0
it is possible one of them authored the blueprint for attacks on luxury @entity2 hotels found on @entity123 's body in @entity160 the previous year			2
by 2013 , @entity240 's @entity2 radical network had a new cause célèbre : the jihad against the @entity244 regime in @entity245			1
drone strikes and infighting in @entity24 had made life increasingly difficult for foreign fighters in @entity25			0
two members of @entity42 's network managed to leave @entity4 despite being under " terrorism prevention and investigation measures " ( @entity255 ) , which means the monitoring of terror suspects who ca n't be charged			1
their current whereabouts are unknown , but one possibility is that they traveled to @entity245			0
tpims were introduced by the @entity4 coalition government in 2012 to replace the previous control order system			0
according to @entity264 , a research fellow at the @entity265 who has conducted extensive research on control orders , the new system removed authorities ' power to relocate terror suspects , making it easier for them to re-engage with their radical networks			0
both of @entity0 's associates moved back to @entity2 and then fled the country			2
@entity276 -- a @entity4 - @entity25 man previously identified as " @entity90 " under the control order regime -- fled in december 2012 after using scissors to cut through the strap of his gps location monitoring device			1
@entity4 authorities believe he hailed a @entity2 taxi , and disappeared			1
he had previously attended the training camp run by the senior @entity61 operatives @entity122 and @entity123 in @entity25 in 2006 and was involved in fund - raising for @entity61 in @entity52 , according to the court documents			1
in 2010 , prior to the introduction of @entity255 , a @entity4 judge had ruled he was " too dangerous to allow him to be in @entity2 for even a short period			1
" nevertheless , the @entity4 secretary of state wrote in court documents that " @entity276 is not considered to represent a direct threat to the @entity4 public			1
the @entity255 notice in this case was intended primarily to prevent fund - raising and overseas travel			0
" his whereabouts today ? unknown			0
@entity298 -- a @entity25 - born radical previously identified as " @entity299 " -- went on the run in november 2013 after entering a west @entity2 mosque and removing his gps monitoring device			1
security cameras captured him leaving the mosque , disguised as a woman wearing a burqa			0
in 2008 , @entity298 had traveled to @entity25 , where @entity24 provided him terrorist training			0
he was detained in @entity307 in 2011 and deported to the @entity4			0
according to the court documents , he was involved in facilitating travel for others to @entity25 and fund - raising for @entity24 , and was planning attacks potentially against @entity152 interests in @entity307 before his arrest			1
he remains wanted by @entity4 security			0
it 's unknown if @entity276 or @entity298 rekindled their ties with @entity0 in @entity2 before leaving the country			2
in 2013 , @entity0 himself traveled to @entity245 , joined @entity3 , and began guarding @entity152 hostages			0
in august 2014 he was dubbed " @entity6 " -- the menacing , taunting , hooded face of @entity3 -- when he orchestrated the brutal beheading of @entity35 journalist @entity322 , the first of many victims murdered on camera .			0

the man now known as " @entity6 " was on @entity4 's terror radar for several years
court documents claim he was a member of a terror recruitment network in @entity2
the papers spell out his connections to other known terrorists in @entity25
