the @entity1 issue dominates international news coverage of @entity4 , with images of missiles , terror tunnels and failed peace negotiations frequently splashed across tv screens and newspapers			1
so you would think that security would be the central issue in tuesday 's @entity4 elections , right ? the short answer is no. poll after poll in @entity4 has confirmed that the public views the high cost of living as the top issue for voters in this election			1
indeed , even a majority of @entity4 's @entity25 citizens within the pre- 1967 borders -- most of whom identify with the @entity1 in the @entity28 and @entity29 -- view socioeconomic issues as the priority for tuesday 's parliamentary poll , rather than advancing the @entity4 - @entity1 peace process			1
what explains this apparent indifference ? first , despite what the polls suggest , peace and security actually remain the most important underlying issue in @entity4 politics			1
the main parties recognize that they need to cross the credibility threshold on this issue , and they therefore include former high - ranking army officers and diplomats among their ranks			0
whatever they may say to pollsters , many voters continue to vote primarily on this issue			0
however , because most such voters are staunch supporters of the right or the left and have already made up their minds , they are unlikely to shift their vote between these two blocs , so their votes are not in play in these elections			0
this was n't always the case -- a significant group of voters once swung back and forth between right and left			0
however , for some time now , the majority of @entity4 have shared a consensual position on the @entity1 question			2
in principle , they continue to favor a two - state solution and they are prepared to make extensive compromises in exchange for genuine peace -- greater concessions than in the 1990s at the height of the peace process			0
however , in practice , that same majority believes that even if an @entity4 government were to agree to more compromises than they view as acceptable , @entity4 would still not obtain the minimum required in terms of peace and security to make the deal worthwhile			1
why ? experience has certainly taught middle @entity4 to be deeply skeptical of the possibility of peace with the @entity1 , irrespective of the complexion of the @entity4 government			1
in 2000 , for example , a @entity93 - led government agreed to a @entity1 state in all of @entity29 , 97 % of the @entity28 and @entity25 @entity96 , including the holiest site in @entity98 , the @entity99			0
yet not only did @entity100 reject the deal , but the @entity1 launched an unprecedented wave of suicide bombings against @entity4 civilians			2
add in the fact that subsequent unilateral @entity4 withdrawals from south @entity107 and @entity29 resulted in tens of thousands of rockets being launched at @entity4 civilians , and the 2008 decision by @entity111 president @entity110 to reject @entity4 prime minister @entity113 's peace proposal -- a plan similar to the @entity116 parameters that @entity100 rejected in 2000 -- and @entity4 wariness is easy to understand			1
since then , leaks from the recent round of peace talks have only served to strengthen the @entity4 public 's skepticism -- the @entity124 leader @entity123 was reportedly prepared to accept a @entity1 state based on the 1967 borders , only for @entity110 to refuse to engage positively with a wide - ranging @entity128 peace outline including this element , according to @entity4 's @entity130 , even when he was presented with it directly by president @entity132 himself			1
as a result of all this , much of the electorate is determining its vote based on other issues , where voters hope political change in @entity4 can actually make a real difference to their lives			0
indeed , the most likely candidate for kingmaker following the elections is @entity146 's centrist party @entity145 , whose agenda is to lower the cost of living in @entity4			2
( @entity146 won fame in @entity4 by dramatically lowering the cost of cell phone use through the introduction of wide - ranging competition into the market			0
) in keeping with the mood of the public , the @entity155 presents a moderate image on the @entity1 issue and has appeared to try to steer away from discussing issues of peace and security			2
in fact , one senior @entity4 official told me that @entity146 's team has been advised against even mentioning the word " peace " for the rest of the campaign			2
that says it all .			0
