are the upcoming elections in @entity2 crucial ? will the results -- a fourth term for prime minister @entity5 or a first for opposition leader @entity6 -- change @entity2 's policy in a significant way ? as @entity2 prepare to go to the polls , the answer seems to be negative			1
many observers in @entity12 and the @entity13 seem to be under the impression that during @entity5 's time in power , @entity2 was hijacked by right wing zealots -- and that @entity6 , leader of the @entity19 opposition party , is the man who will save the country and return it to the path of sanity			1
but the fact is that when it comes to the most crucial question regarding the future of @entity2 and the @entity29 -- what to do about the @entity31 -- the difference between the two candidates is negligible , a divergence that is short on substance but long on style and rhetoric			1
while @entity5 's insistence on @entity2 's continued ruling over millions of @entity31 is expressed in aggressive , often religious and nationalistic language , @entity6 's justifications for doing the same thing would sound much softer and easier to digest in the western world			1
but at the end of the day , neither @entity5 nor @entity6 have any real intention to put an end to the occupation of the @entity31 territories			1
@entity5 says it clearly and openly ; @entity6 and his coalition partners only hint at it			1

the main issues that have been discussed during the campaign are economic ones -- cost of living , housing prices , government oversight -- but even then , slogans and populist promises have largely replaced the in - depth debates we should be having			0
but the topics that seem to have consumed most of the headlines range from pure gossip to scandals , some of them concerning the behavior of @entity5 and his wife @entity76			2
there was the " bottlegate " affair -- claims that the wife of the prime minister had pocketed cash from bottle recycling at their official residence			0
the @entity85 say they reimbursed the government			0
@entity2 is a country that is still looking for its way forward ; one that lacks internationally recognized borders ; one that has not yet decided whether it is a @entity90 society or a @entity29 one ; one that can not decide whether it wants to be religious or secular , @entity92 or bi-national			2
all of these critical issues -- none of them decided on -- have been cast aside , ignored , covered up or denied by a country that has busied itself with the important business of recycled bottles at the prime minister 's residence			0
there is a big elephant in the room , but @entity2 is turning its back to it			2
there is a big elephant in the room , but @entity2 believes that if nobody talks about it , the elephant does not exist			2
this elephant is absent from the @entity2 discourse on a day - to - day basis , and it is absent during elections -- a time when public discourse should be only be focused on what really matters			2
the elephant in the @entity2 room is the unending occupation of @entity31 territories , and nobody is talking about it			1
most of the parties running in the elections have not even bothered to try to answer questions about what their plans are for the @entity31			2
but the occupation also continues to be a non-issue for too many ordinary @entity2 , who know very little -- and care even less -- about the cruel reality for the millions of @entity31 who live without civil rights in the @entity132 and who are kept under siege in @entity135			1
for those who regard @entity6 and the center - left as the great hope of this campaign , it is important to remember that it was the @entity2 @entity142 who established the occupation and settlement projects in @entity31 territory			1
@entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 : those @entity142 leaders , so beloved by the @entity152 , are the founding fathers of the most significant venture of modern @entity2 -- the illegal transfer of a @entity92 population to stolen land			0
it was a project whose purpose was to prevent any kind of equal division of the land , or a settlement with the @entity31 -- and as such it has been a great success story			0
@entity142 never had a real plan for the @entity31 , except to time and again renew the endless peace process , which may be the longest in history			0
this is still true now , on the eve of elections that stand a real chance of bringing the @entity19 to power			0
the more than 500,000 settlers in the @entity132 and @entity173 have created what may be an irreversible reality , but @entity6 's only answer to it is to get back to the negotiation table			1
in private circles he mentions five years as the time he needs to conclude the process			0
there is no better indication that @entity6 has no intention of ending the occupation any time soon			1
numerous peace plans have already been worked out in great detail ; all that is needed is for one courageous @entity2 leader to implement any one of them			0
@entity6 , at least at this stage , does not seem to be the one capable of doing this			0
on tuesday the " only democracy in the @entity29 " will elect a new parliament and a new government , in what is frequently described as a celebration of " people power			0
" but the reality is that here in @entity2 , it is only the masters who will vote and decide on the future -- not only for themselves , but for the millions of @entity31 who have for nearly half a century been living under their control , directly in the @entity132 and indirectly in @entity135			1
and yet , it seems , their fate is not a topic worthy of discussion			0
to call this a democracy in 2015 is rather problematic .			0

@entity212 : @entity2 's occupation of @entity31 territory has gone mostly *undiscussed* ahead of tuesday 's election
@entity212 : @entity5 , @entity6 do *n't* have the courage to end the occupation
