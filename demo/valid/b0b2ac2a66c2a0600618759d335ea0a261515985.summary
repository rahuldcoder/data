@entity0 , a former nurse 's aide accused of stabbing a pregnant @entity4 woman , was charged friday with criminal attempt to commit first - degree murder , unlawful termination of pregnancy , and other crimes for allegedly cutting a fetus from the womb			1
@entity13 district attorney @entity12 was unable to file a murder charge under state law , and he highlighted how the coroner found that the fetus did n't show any signs of life outside the womb , @entity12 said			1
the victim , @entity20 , 26 , who was seven months ' pregnant , survived this month 's attack , which occurred when she went to a @entity23 home to buy baby clothes advertised for sale on @entity26			1
" now , i understand that many in the community -- and heaven knows i 've heard from a lot of them -- would like me to file homicide charges , " @entity12 told reporters			1
" however , that is not possible under @entity4 law without proof of live birth			1
a prosecutor can not file murder charges when a baby who is killed has not lived outside the body of the mother			2
for similar reasons , i can not bring charges of child abuse resulting in death , " the district attorney said			2
the fetus ' lungs never inflated , @entity12 said			2
the fetus ' exact cause of death , however , is n't immediately known and is expected to be revealed when the final autopsy report is released in six to eight weeks , he said			2
@entity20 and her partner , identified only as @entity55 , named the female fetus @entity57 , the prosecutor said			0
@entity0 , 34 , appeared briefly in a holding room during an initial court appearance friday , but she did n't enter the courtroom			1
her attorneys waived a formal reading of charges at the hearing , which occurred before the prosecutor 's press conference			0
" she could get a long sentence and very well could die in prison , " the district attorney said about @entity0 , adding he could n't immediately calculate the maximum number of years she faces if convicted of all counts			1
@entity0 was also charged with two counts of crime of violence , two counts of first - degree assault , and two counts of second - degree assault , @entity12 said			1
@entity0 's next court date , a preliminary hearing , is may 5			1
she is being held on a $ 2 million bond			1
earlier friday , the @entity84 said the fetus was n't alive on its own after it was cut from @entity20 ' womb			0
the female fetus did n't exhibit " any signs of life outside of the womb , therefore the circumstance is not being considered a live birth , " coroner @entity87 said in a statement			1
friday 's finding came a day after prosecutors indicated that @entity0 would n't face a murder charge in the march 18 assault			1
@entity20 was released from the hospital on thursday , relatives said			0
the coroner 's office performed an autopsy on the fetus and said @entity20 was 34 weeks pregnant			2
" an autopsy has been completed , " @entity87 said			0
" at this time neither the autopsy or the investigation have provided any evidence that the baby exhibited any signs of life outside of the womb , therefore the circumstance is not being considered a live birth			1
no evidence of trauma or injuries were found on the body			0
" final autopsy results will be released once all testing and further studies are complete , " @entity87 said			0
the coroner 's finding apparently contradicts earlier claims made in police reports that the fetus " gasped " and that emergency room personnel described the fetus as viable			0
@entity131 , the 35 - year - old husband of @entity132 , told police he found his wife " covered in blood " in the family home and later found " a small baby lying in the bathtub , " a @entity23 police report said			2
" he rubbed the baby slightly then rolled it over to ... see it take a gasping breath , " the report said			0
@entity131 took the baby and his wife to the emergency room of @entity147 , and the hospital told police the baby " would have been viable , " the police report said			0
but on friday , district attorney @entity12 said that @entity131 altered his earlier statement to police			0
without referring to @entity131 by name , @entity12 cited how media accounts took note of the police report and how a " witness observed @entity57 taking a gasping breath			0
" " however , upon a more thorough examination of this witness by the @entity162 , the witness clarified that @entity57 was still and her mouth was open , but she was not breathing , which is consistent with medical evidence from the autopsy , " @entity12 told reporters			0
@entity1 's @entity167 contributed to this report .			0

@entity170 acknowledges that some *people* demand a homicide charge
" that is not possible under @entity4 law without proof of live birth , " he says
@entity0 is held on $ 2 million bond in an attack on a seven - months ' pregnant woman
