@entity3 , yet no one bats an eye			2
but when the ceo of @entity0 announced a plan he hoped would ease racial tensions , the response was immediate outrage ! this latest controversy started monday when @entity0 ceo @entity12 unveiled a new initiative in which @entity0 baristas would write the words " @entity16 " on coffee cups to help spark a dialogue on race			1
@entity20 even took out full - page ads in the @entity22 and @entity23 touting this effort			2
@entity25 immediately lit up with a flurry of angry tweets -- apparently from people who have consumed far too much caffeine			2
surprisingly , though , the backlash came from all sides			0
one self - described conservative tweeted this : a person who noted her support of progressive causes in her @entity25 profile tweeted : even people in the middle expressed scorn with tweets such as : i , on the other hand , applaud @entity20 's efforts , at least in theory			0
as @entity20 correctly stated when discussing the genesis for " race together , " " if we just keep going about our business ... and ignoring this ( racial issue ) , then i think we are , in a sense , part of the problem			1
" sure , i also see some logistical problems with the " get your iced @entity56 with a shot of racial tolerance " approach			0
first , i live in @entity60 , where @entity60 barely have the patience to wait for a cup of plain old coffee to be poured let alone stand in line longer while people engage in a nuanced discourse on race			1
i can envision awkward situations where the baristas ask a customer , " so how do you want your coffee ? " to which the customer responds , " @entity74			0
" for some reason saying " black " in the context of this program could feel uncomfortable			0
next thing you know , @entity0 will have to coin politically correct terms for " black " coffee			1
and as a practical matter , only 40 % of @entity0 employees are minorities			1
consequently , in most @entity0 , the conversation about racial tolerance will between be between two white people			1
but let 's put those issues aside			0
the swift and angry backlash against @entity20 's idea proves once again that not only do n't we live in a post-racial @entity94 , we live in a hyper - racial one			0
in fact , a recent @entity1 / @entity97 poll found 40 % of @entity94 believe racial relations have become worse during the six years @entity100 has been in the @entity101			1
it 's strikingly obvious that if we are going to improve this situation , we need to have a candid and brutally honest discussion about the underlying factors contributing to racism , the lack of empathy for people of other races , etc. and that 's simply what @entity0 ' " race together " stated goal is : " to stimulate conversation , compassion and positive action regarding race in @entity94			1
" @entity0 ' senior vice president of communications , @entity118 , deleted his @entity25 account monday after " feeling personally attacked in a cascade of negativity " and being " overwhelmed by the volume and tenor of the discussion " in response to " race together			1
" but @entity126 was back on @entity25 on tuesday night			0
why ? because he truly believed in " the power of meaningful , civil , thoughtful , respectful open conversation			0
" @entity131 's reaction may just be a teachable moment on discussing race			1
it 's truly not an easy topic to broach			0
the initial response by some , like @entity126 , may be to shut down when racial discussions become uncomfortable			1
but then , hopefully like @entity126 did later , the conversation can be rejoined within a framework that 's respectful to all involved			0
but to be blunt , one of the biggest obstacles in even starting this conversation is that most white @entity94 do n't want to discuss race , as polls have confirmed			2
for example , after the grand jury in @entity148 , @entity149 , did n't indict police officer @entity151 in the killing of teenager @entity153 , a poll found that 80 % of blacks felt that the shooting raised important issues about race that needed to be discussed			2
how many white people agreed ? only 37 %			0
and personally i have seen some white friends become defensive when race issues are raised			2
why ? because many view it as an accusation that they are somehow racist ( or at least complicit in racism ) as opposed to a starting point for a productive conversation			0
the question is how can we begin that talk about race that our nation desperately needs to have ? true , the line at @entity0 might not be the best place			1
but it has to start somewhere if we are going to close the racial gap that many , including myself , feel is growing .			2

response mostly negative after @entity0 launches initiative to talk about race relations
@entity184 : @entity0 might not be best place , but how do we start a talk about race ?
