they climb up a rugged mountain , appearing to cling to its side by their fingernails			0
bit by bit , bag by bag , high wire daredevils hoist body bags hundreds of feet up to waiting helicopters , trying to remain stable in the high winds			1
rescuers pin red flags on the earth when they discover new fragments			0
winched down from helicopters on to the steep , icy slopes , where debris lies scattered across hundreds of meters , workers have had to be tied together in two - person teams			1
one is there to carry out the investigation and recovery			2
the second is charged with ensuring their safety as they 're buffeted by the weather			2
complicating matters , very few of the bodies have been found whole , @entity44 , captain of rescue operations , told @entity4 on friday			1

already , the @entity104 prosecutor , @entity103 , has revealed that cockpit audio indicated that @entity68 co-pilot @entity107 " wanted to destroy the aircraft			0
