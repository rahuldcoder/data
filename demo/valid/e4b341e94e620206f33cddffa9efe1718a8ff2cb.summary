@entity0 laid down a daunting marker for his @entity4 rivals at saturday 's qualifying for the opening race of the 2015 season			1
the world champion will start on pole for the @entity11 @entity10 , as he did last year and has done on three other occasions in his career			1
while the @entity15 driver failed to finish the 2014 race -- the only time he did not convert first on the grid to first at the checkered flag -- he is more hopeful this time as he seeks his first victory in @entity20 since winning his only other world title back in 2008			1
@entity0 was over half a second quicker than @entity24 teammate @entity23 , and nearly 1.4 seconds faster than third - placed @entity25 of @entity26			1
" we had a difficult season last year here , so definitely as a team , as a whole , we 're hoping for a better start , for both cars to succeed tomorrow , " the 30 - year - old said			1
" so we 're going to work as hard as we can to make sure we do that and lots of work to be done tonight for the race tomorrow , because that is going to be a huge challenge still and obviously a good fight , hopefully , with @entity23			1
" @entity23 , runner - up in last year 's championship amid considerable tension between the two drivers , said his teammate " drove like a champ			1
" " @entity0 was in impressive form today , he did an awesome job and nailed it all the time , " said the @entity47 , who had an engine cutout in the second session and then ran wide in @entity51			1
" for me , the speed was there but i just did n't get it together today			0
so it was n't a great day			0
" @entity0 was quick but i did n't get my laps together today so i 'm not too worried about pace -- i 'm not worried about pace at all			1
on friday , in the long runs , my pace was very strong so yeah , hopefully it can be the other way tomorrow			0
" the veteran @entity25 said he achieved his goal of being the " best of the rest " as he finished just ahead of @entity66 's new signing @entity67 and the @entity47 's teammate @entity68			2
" the @entity74 looked strong and were pushing us hard , " said the @entity70 , who has failed to finish in seven of 12 starts at @entity73 including last year			0
" it will be a tough battle tomorrow so we need to get the start right and have a good strategy to secure a podium and really start the season on a high note			2
" @entity25 's @entity26 teammate @entity83 qualified sixth but will face a fitness test on sunday morning after experiencing back pain in the first two sessions			2
four - time world champion @entity67 played down @entity66 's big improvement on last season 's speed			1
" let 's keep our feet on the ground			0
so far this weekend , it 's gone well and we 've had no problems with the car , " said the former @entity94 star			0
" it 's a shame that third place escaped us , as that would have made us the first team behind @entity24 , but it was n't by much			1
we lost third place because my first run was n't quick enough : i 'm not very pleased with myself , because there was still some performance to be found			0
" first and second are a long way in front , but anything can happen during the grand prix			0
there 's not much of a gap between third and fourth on the grid , so i think the podium is a realistic goal			0
" last year @entity67 was upstaged by new teammate @entity116 , who qualified second and then finished runner - up in his home race only to be disqualified for a fuel - flow infringement			1
on sunday he will start in seventh place as @entity94 's @entity122 - powered car struggled to match the @entity24 engines , while @entity67 's replacement @entity125 was 13th after failing to reach @entity51			1
" we suffered a bit this time last year , but there are a few more issues this year which were n't expected , " said @entity116 , who was third in the 2014 championship			0
" i 'm really happy with seventh as realistically that 's the best we could have done today			0
" @entity94 's feeder team @entity134 had an encouraging start with its two rookie drivers			2
@entity137 , son of the former rally champion , qualified eighth while @entity141 17 - year - old @entity140 -- whose father @entity142 raced in @entity4 -- was 12th			2
@entity143 rounded out the top 10 with @entity146 ninth ahead of teammate @entity147			2
@entity149 's new pairing of @entity150 and @entity151 qualified 11th and 16th respectively after they were able to take to the track when last season 's reserve driver @entity153 waived his court - won right to line up in @entity20			1
the @entity141 , who was successful in his legal battle to have an agreement for a race seat upheld , released a statement after friday 's practice sessions saying he would continue to negotiate with @entity149 to resolve the situation			2
@entity162 , meanwhile , confirmed all the preseason evidence that its new relationship with engine supplier @entity165 is yet to bear fruit			0
with @entity173 having failed to get its hastily - prepared car ready in time , the @entity168 team -- which has won 12 drivers ' titles and eight constructors ' crowns -- will start at the back of the grid			2
former world champion @entity177 was 17th and @entity178 -- filling in for new signing @entity179 , who is recovering from concussion -- was 18th			1
" this level of performance was n't a surprise for us : we knew from winter testing that the pace was n't there , so we knew we were n't going to be competitive here , " @entity177 said			0
" however , there 's a good feeling about the car -- i know we 're so far off , but the basic car is there beneath me , and we 're adding to our experience and learning with every lap we do			0
" it 's going to be a really difficult race for us -- we have n't done a race distance yet , and my longest run is 12 laps -- but we want to do the best we can because there 's so much learning to be had			0
" like us on @entity205			0
