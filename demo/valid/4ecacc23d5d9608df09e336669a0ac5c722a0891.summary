@entity1 , @entity2 years before he was at the controls of a @entity6 plane that plunged into the @entity7 , @entity0 told the airline he worked for that he 'd had a bout with depression			1
@entity0 , the co-pilot of @entity12 who authorities accuse of deliberately crashing the plane , told his @entity16 flight training school in 2009 that he had a " previous episode of severe depression , " the airline said tuesday			1
email correspondence between @entity0 and the school discovered in an internal investigation , @entity16 said , included medical documents he submitted in connection with resuming his flight training			1
the announcement indicates that @entity16 , the parent company of @entity6 , knew of @entity0 's battle with depression , allowed him to continue training and ultimately put him in the cockpit			1
@entity16 , whose ceo previously said @entity0 was 100 % fit to fly , described its statement tuesday as a " swift and seamless clarification " and said it was sharing the information and documents -- including training and medical records -- with public prosecutors			1
what was mental state of @entity6 co-pilot ? it 's a development that will likely be a part of the crash investigation , but it 's only one piece of the puzzle , @entity3 aviation correspondent @entity42 said			1
" we need to know what happened after he returned in 2009 and finished his training , because that tells us whether there was the correct procedure and process , " he said			2
a @entity16 spokesperson told @entity3 on tuesday that @entity0 had a valid medical certificate , had passed all his examinations and " held all the licenses required			1
" check out the latest from our correspondents the details about @entity0 's correspondence with the flight school during his training were among several developments as investigators continued to delve into what caused the crash and @entity0 's possible motive for downing the jet			1
earlier , a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office in @entity1 said @entity0 suffered from suicidal tendencies at some point before his aviation career			1
medical records reveal that @entity0 was suicidal at one time and underwent psychotherapy before he got his pilot 's license , prosecutor 's spokesman @entity74 said			1
@entity74 emphasized there 's no evidence suggesting @entity0 was suicidal or acting aggressively before the crash			1
investigators are looking into whether @entity0 feared his medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot 's license , a @entity85 government official briefed on the investigation into last week 's crash told @entity3 on tuesday			1
while flying was " a big part of his life , " the source said , it 's only one theory being considered			2
another source , a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation , also told @entity3 that authorities believe the primary motive for @entity102 to bring down the plane was that he feared he would not be allowed to fly because of his medical problems			0
@entity0 's girlfriend told investigators he had seen an eye doctor and a neuropsychologist , both of whom deemed him unfit to work recently and concluded he had psychological issues , the @entity85 government official said			1
@entity0 told the neuropsychologist that he was too stressed with work , the official said			1
but no matter what details emerge about his previous mental health struggles , there 's more to the story , said @entity120 , a forensic psychologist			0
" psychology can explain why somebody would turn rage inward on themselves about the fact that maybe they were n't going to keep doing their job and they 're upset about that and so they 're suicidal , " he said			0
" but there is no mental illness that explains why somebody then feels entitled to also take that rage and turn it outward on 149 other people who had nothing to do with the person 's problems			0
" reports say a cell phone video shows the nightmarish final seconds of @entity141 , but a police spokesman said the accounts were " completely wrong			1
" @entity7 magazine @entity145 and @entity2 newspaper @entity146 reported that a video recovered from a phone at the wreckage site showed the inside of the plane moments before it crashed			1
" one can hear cries of ' my @entity153 ' in several languages , " @entity145 reported			2
" @entity155 can also be heard more than three times , perhaps of the pilot trying to open the cockpit door with a heavy object			0
towards the end , after a heavy shake , stronger than the others , the screaming intensifies			0
" the two publications described the video , but did not post it on their websites			2
the publications reported that they watched the video , which was found by a source close to the investigation			2
" it is a very disturbing scene , " said @entity172 , editor - in - chief of @entity146 online			1
an official with @entity177 's accident investigation agency , the @entity178 , said the agency is not aware of any such video			2
lt. col. @entity181 , a @entity7 @entity182 spokesman in charge of communications on rescue efforts around the @entity6 crash site , told @entity3 that the reports were " completely wrong " and " unwarranted			1
" cell phones have been collected at the site , he said , but that they " had n't been exploited yet			0
" @entity181 said he believed the cell phones would need to be sent to the @entity191 in @entity192 , near @entity193 , in order to be analyzed by specialized technicians working hand - in - hand with investigators			0
but none of the cell phones found so far have been sent to the institute , @entity181 said			2
asked whether staff involved in the search could have leaked a memory card to the media , @entity181 answered with a categorical " no. " @entity172 told " @entity205 : @entity206 " that he had watched the video and stood by the report , saying @entity146 and @entity145 are " very confident " that the clip is real			1
he noted that investigators only revealed they 'd recovered cell phones from the crash site after @entity146 and @entity145 published their reports			1
" that is something we did not know before			0
... overall we can say many things of the investigation were n't revealed by the investigation at the beginning , " he said			0
while investigators search for clues to @entity0 's motivation , recovery workers continue the grim task of searching for the remains of those killed in the march 24 crash			2
the remains of at least 78 people on board the plane have been identified so far using dna analysis			0
@entity235 warned monday that " it may not be possible to find the human remains of all the 150 passengers , as some of them may have been pulverized by the crash			0
" but @entity177 president @entity244 , speaking alongside @entity2 chancellor @entity242 in @entity243 , was more positive , saying that it should be possible to identify all the victims by the end of the week			0
a simple stone memorial has been set up at @entity249 , where grieving relatives of those killed have laid flowers and held prayers			0
@entity6 crash compensation : what we know who was the captain of @entity141 9525 ? the @entity178 , @entity177 's accident investigation agency , said its ongoing safety investigation was focusing on a more detailed analysis of the flight history leading up to the crash , based on the audio recovered from the cockpit voice recorder and any other available data			2
" a deliberate act by a man with a disturbed psychological profile is a possible scenario , " @entity178 spokeswoman @entity267 told @entity3			0
" the first step of the investigation is to describe more precisely what happened			0
" this will be based mainly on analysis of the cockpit voice recorder , to be supplemented by data from the flight data recorder if it is found , she said			2
" but we will also look at other events with possibly similar scenarios , try to understand if there are systemic weaknesses which may contribute or facilitate such scenarios			0
" we will in particular look at the cockpit door locking as well as the criteria and procedures applied to detect specific psychological profiles			0
" @entity3 's @entity293 reported from @entity1 and @entity294 from @entity295 , while @entity296 wrote from @entity297			0
@entity3 's @entity298 , @entity299 , @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity303 , @entity305 - @entity304 and @entity306 contributed to this report .			0
