@entity1 's highest court has reversed a controversial law that gave the authorities sweeping powers to arrest and potentially jail people for comments posted on social networks and other internet platforms			1
the @entity10 ruled that @entity11 of the 2008 @entity12 was " unconstitutional " and " hit at the root of liberty and freedom of expression , the two cardinal pillars of democracy			1
" under @entity20 , alleged offenders could face up to three years in jail for posting material that is " grossly offensive , " has " menacing character , " -- or perhaps even more ambiguously -- causes " annoyance or inconvenience			1
" the court said this wording was " vague " and could be " misconstrued , " according to @entity28 , an advocate who was present at the hearing in @entity30 tuesday			1
@entity1 's cyber laws have ignited a furious debate about curbs on freedom of speech in recent years			1
in 2012 , a university professor was arrested for circulating a cartoon that poked fun at @entity39 chief minister @entity38			2

he was charged with a range of offenses including defamation , insulting a woman and sending offensive messages from a computer			1
@entity52 called the charges a misuse of the law " in the name of surveillance , to curb democratic rights , freedom of speech and human rights of common people			0
" a year earlier , @entity30 went one step further with its digital crackdown when the so - called " intermediary guidelines " implicated web platforms themselves			0
the rules now require @entity69 companies to take down any content seen as " disparaging , " " blasphemous , " or " defamatory " within 36 hours of a user submitting a formal request for removal			2
in @entity76 , @entity1 's financial center , police spokesman @entity74 told @entity2 in february that some 650 posts and pages were blocked last year under these regulations			2
