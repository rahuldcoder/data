@entity1 , @entity2 crowds massed at a bridge in @entity1 , @entity2 , sunday to remember and reflect upon the sacrifices of another crowd that gathered at the same bridge half a century ago on a day that came to be known as " @entity10			1
" walkers marched across the @entity12 in the afternoon to commemorate those freedom - marchers who were clubbed and tear - gassed by state troopers as they peacefully filed across on march 7 , 1965			1
it was shoulder to shoulder near the bridge and several blocks away			1
there were so many people that walking is a bit misleading -- people just really moved inch by inch along the way			2
the protest decades ago against the denial of civil rights to @entity31 based solely on the color of their skin , and the television coverage of the bludgeoning dealt them , hastened the passage of the @entity38			1
on sunday at @entity1 's @entity43 , a historically black church , leaders in the religious and political realm as well as community organizers gathered to hear speeches , sing hymns and remember what happened 50 years ago			1
@entity31 attorney general @entity47 was in the audience			2
rev. @entity49 spoke , as did rev. @entity50			2
an important figure in the decades - long fight for civil rights , former @entity55 mayor and @entity57 ambassador @entity56 remembered the struggle in the 1960s but wanted everyone to keep pushing forward and thinking about achieving economic equality today			2
" we 've got to focus on ourselves not as problems but as visionaries , " he said			2
" we have come a long , long way , but i have enjoyed every bit of it , " @entity56 remarked			2
several people remarked at how much it meant that the day before , on saturday , @entity31 's first @entity71 - @entity31 president , @entity72 , made a rousing speech on racial progress in a diverse country			1
he said that the struggle against discrimination continues today			2
looking back , the " @entity10 " march was triggered when a law officer shot a black man dead the month before			2
but it was about more -- the right to vote for all @entity31			2
about 600 people were going to march 50 miles to the state capital in @entity85 before they were forcibly stopped			1
sunday 's festivities started with a breakfast and end late with a dance			2
a string of parades , receptions , reflections , films and discussions will fill the time in between			0
the commemoration marking 50 years since " @entity10 " continues on monday			1
" our march is not yet finished			0
but we are getting closer , " @entity72 said saturday , his words echoing into a crowd of thousands lined up in front of him			1
@entity72 emphasized that a day of commemoration is not enough to repay the debt paid by the marchers who were beaten 50 years ago as they demonstrated for voting rights			1
" if @entity1 taught us anything , it 's that our work is never done , " the president said near @entity12			1
read president @entity72 's prepared remarks the president said that what civil rights marchers did years ago " will reverberate through the ages			1
not because the change they won was preordained ; not because their victory was complete ; but because they proved that nonviolent change is possible ; that love and hope can conquer hate			0
" he hailed the marchers as heroes			0
the president said that " the @entity31 who crossed this bridge , they were not physically imposing , but they gave courage to millions			1
they held no elected office			0
but they led a nation			0
" the president called on @entity134 to restore the @entity38 , first passed in 1965			1
in 2013 , the @entity31 @entity135 overturned a key provision of the law that required certain states with a history of racial discrimination at the polls to " pre-clear " any changes to the law with the federal government before implementing them			0
efforts to revive key provisions of the act have stalled in @entity134			0
50 years later : memories from ' @entity10 ' nurse many of the nation 's leaders , activists and celebrities were in @entity1 on saturday attending various activities taking place in memory of the historic event			1
on saturday , rep. @entity160 -- one of the demonstrators bloodied by troopers 50 years ago -- and nearly 100 other members of @entity134 from both parties joined the president at the bridge in @entity1 -- a bridge that still bears the name of @entity170 , a @entity171 general who was also a @entity172 leader			1
" we must use this moment to recommit ourselves to do all we can to finish this work			0
there 's still work to be done , " said @entity160 , adding this is an opportunity to " redeem the soul of @entity31			0
" @entity160 's memories of the march reflecting a sense of change in the half century since " @entity10 , " and with @entity1 again in a national media spotlight , the mood in the crowd saturday was of unity , and talks were focused on how to move @entity31 forward			1
but some current @entity1 residents worried that after the dignitaries leave their town -- with a population 82 % black and with more than 40 % of its people living below the national poverty level -- will fade from view except for its historical significance			0
@entity197 , 59 , has lived in @entity1 all her life			0
she was 9 years old on " @entity10 " and with her mother had just welcomed a little sister , @entity200 , to the world on that day			1
the two sisters grew up in @entity1 less than a decade apart			0
opinion : @entity1 's historic bridge deserves a better name @entity200 left @entity1 after high school and now lives in @entity55			0
her view of @entity1 has changed over the years -- looking in from the outside			1
" i do n't see how @entity1 will move forward without togetherness , " said @entity200			0
" there is no diversity in @entity1			0
people do n't live together			0
