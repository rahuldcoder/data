pope @entity0 has said that all he wants is to go out one day to a pizzeria " without being recognized			1
" wishful thinking , perhaps			0
but when you 're the the leader of the catholic world pizza comes to you			0
pizzeria owner @entity6 personally handed the pope a pie on sunday as his motorcade drove through @entity10			1
but , not just any pizza : a @entity10 - style thin crust creation with " @entity13 " spelled out in dough and topped with yellow cherry tomatoes , a reference to the @entity18 flag			1
a video shows @entity6 , co-owner of @entity20 , hopping a barrier with the pie in hand as the @entity25 approaches			2
" papa ! @entity30 ! " he yelled as he ran toward the open - top vehicle , apparently unimpeded by papal minders			0
the video shows @entity0 reaching down and receiving the offering			0
after the hand off @entity6 pumps his fist in the air , victorious , as the crowd cheers			0
" i gave him the pizza and with a smile he said ' thank you , ' " @entity6 told @entity1			2
@entity6 comes from a pizza - making family			2
his says his father made a pizza for president @entity44 when he visited @entity10 in 1994			2
when @entity6 learned @entity0 was going to be in town he decided to follow in his father 's footsteps			1
" it 's really hard for me to understand what i managed to do , " @entity6 said			0
" giving a pizza you made with your own hands to the @entity0 is very emotional			1
it 's really hard for me to express the value of this gesture for a man we really love and value , for a beautiful person full of humanity			0
" @entity6 is still waiting to hear whether @entity0 enjoyed the edible offering .			1
