in 1796 , in his final annual address to @entity2 , president @entity0 called for the creation of : " ... a @entity5 ; and also a @entity6			1
the desirableness of both these institutions , has so constantly increased with every new view i have taken of the subject , that i can not omit the opportunity of once for all , recalling your attention to them			1
" the @entity6 was soon built at @entity16			1
but despite leaving $ 22,222 for its establishment ( a lot of money back then ) in his last will and testament , @entity17 's @entity5 never came to pass			1
instead , lawmakers chose to rely on state governments and religious denominations to build and finance new colleges and universities			1
today , the @entity28 higher education system is in crisis			1
the price of college has grown astronomically , forcing students and parents to take out loans that now exceed $ 1.2 trillion in outstanding debt			1
many of those loans are falling into default as graduates struggle to find work			1
the latest research suggests that our vaunted universities are producing graduates who have n't learned very much			1
the time has come to revive @entity0 's great idea , in 21st century form			1
advances in information technology that would have seemed like pure magic in colonial times mean we can now create a 21st @entity52 that will help millions of students get a high - quality , low - cost college education — without hiring any professors , building any buildings or costing the taxpayers a dime			1
to see how , it helps to understand the three ways the federal government currently supports higher education			1
two of them are well known			2
first , the @entity67 , @entity65 , and other federal agencies spend hundreds of billions of dollars financing university - based research , contributing to countless scientific breakthroughs and commercial innovations			1
second , the @entity28 @entity72 provides $ 150 billion annually in grants and loans to help students pay for college			2
as tuitions rise and states continue to slash funding for public universities ( @entity83 gov. @entity82 recently proposed $ 300 million in new cuts ) , the federal government has become the college financier of last resort			2
but there is a third essential federal role in higher education that is far less well known			2
in many ways , it 's the most important of them all , and the key to creating a @entity94			2
in addition to funding colleges , the federal government approves colleges			2
it does this through a little - understood process called accreditation			1
to be eligible for those billions of research and financial aid dollars , colleges must be accredited			2
technically , accreditors are nonprofit organizations run by consortia of existing colleges			2
but in order to make a college eligible for federal money , accreditors must first be approved by the federal government			1
without that approval and the money that goes along with it , both colleges and accreditors would immediately close up shop			1
in other words , @entity120 ultimately decides who gets to be an @entity28 college and grant college degrees			2
so , here 's the big idea : in order to build a 21st @entity52 , all the federal government has to do is something very simple : approve itself			1
in @entity0 's days , this would have been only the first step of a process subsequently involving the construction of an actual university			1
doing this today would accomplish little in solving the higher education crisis , because physical universities cost billions of dollars to construct from scratch and can still only enroll a handful of the many students who ca n't afford a good education			1
fortunately , there 's no need for new buildings — or , for that matter , administrators , libraries , faculty , and all the rest			2
existing colleges and universities , flush with federal dollars , have already created all the essential building blocks for @entity153 with an internet connection can log on to @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , and many other websites offering high - quality online courses , created by many of the world 's greatest universities and taught by tenured professors , for free			2
tens of millions of students have already signed up for these courses over the last four years			2
yet enrollment in traditional colleges has n't flagged , and prices have continued to rise			0
the free college providers ca n't ( or wo n't ) give online students the one thing they need more than anything else : a college degree			0
elite universities like @entity177 and @entity178 do n't want to dilute their exclusive brands			0
@entity181 universities do n't want to give away something they 're currently selling for a lot of money			1
that 's where the federal government comes in			0
with some authorizing language from @entity2 and a small , one - time start - up budget , the @entity28 @entity72 could create a nonprofit , bipartisan organization with only two missions : approving courses and granting degrees			0
do n't worry , federal bureaucrats wo n't be in charge of academic matters			0
instead , @entity197 would hire teams of leading scholars to evaluate and approve courses			0
some of the decisions should n't be difficult			0
for example , this week , @entity156 is launching a free , nine - week - long online course called " introduction to @entity203 and @entity204			1
" it will be taught by dr. @entity205 , who is the chancellor of the renowned @entity206 , and dr. @entity207 , who leads the @entity209 's @entity208			0
the course materials mirror those taught to some of the smartest students in the world on @entity206 's campus in @entity216 , @entity217			0
it seems likely that this is a good course			0
@entity197 , moreover , would n't be limited to courses from existing colleges			0
any higher education provider , public or private sector , could submit a course for approval			0
those that are n't already accredited would pay a fee to cover the cost of evaluation			1
@entity197 would also map out which courses students need to take to earn an associate or bachelor 's degree			0
this wo n't be difficult , since existing colleges have already established a standard set of requirements : a certain number of approved lower - and upper - division courses , plus an approved sequence in an academic major , adding up to 60 or 120 credits			0
once students complete the credits , @entity197 will grant them a degree			0
while many of the courses will be free , students will bear small costs for taking exams through secure online channels or in - person testing facilities			0
( textbooks will be free and open - source )			0
students will also pay a modest fee of a few hundred dollars for the degree itself , enough to defray the operating costs of @entity197 lower - income students will be able to pay for those expenses using the same federal grant and loan programs they currently use to pay tuition at accredited colleges			0
since @entity197 will likely be much cheaper , this will actually save the taxpayers money in the long run			1
if it all sounds too good to be true , keep in mind that free online courses from the likes of @entity206 are a very recent phenomenon			0
higher education policies just have n't adapted to them — yet			0
the federal government 's higher education approval powers are long - established			0
now it just needs to use them on behalf of students , instead of traditional colleges and universities that are charging far too much			0
@entity0 was right all along .			0

in 1796 , @entity17 called for a national university and even left money behind to fund it
@entity288 : we could build a 21st century version of a national university at no cost to taxpayers
