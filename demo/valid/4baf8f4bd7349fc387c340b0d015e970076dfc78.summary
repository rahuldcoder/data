in a side room at the @entity2 , four girls chat and giggle			1
one teenage girl in particular catches our attention			2
we met her just a few weeks after @entity8 had attacked her school and abducted almost 300 students			1
as the @entity8 trucks carrying them began to speed away to the militants ' territory , she and her friend bravely jumped , barely escaping with their lives			1
she was one of the lucky ones			2
@entity17 , she says , from that day on became a reminder of what almost happened			0
a place she never wanted to return			0
but now she is back and the change in her is remarkable			0
she dreams of remaining in the classroom as a teacher , so that just like her tutors , she can influence and inspire young minds			0
studying with her here are 21 other girls from @entity27			1
they , too , escaped @entity8			1
like hundreds of others across @entity31 's @entity30 , they were targeted simply for going to school			1
choosing to go back to class is a statement of their courage and focus on education , which they hope will bring change back home			1
" my people need my support , " one girl says			0
" and me going to school will make that change , " she wants to be a surgeon			1
in a part of the world often lacking the most basic health care infrastructure , she has chosen to bring value to her community			0
one of three students we spoke to who want to study medicine , she 's extraordinarily focused and firm in her responses			0
it is hard to imagine sitting with her now what she and the other girls have been through at @entity8 's hands , what they almost lost			1
some questions , though , they ca n't answer : any questions about the night of the attack , any reference to the friends still missing			0
enrolled on scholarships at the university , these girls are the lucky ones , and they know it			2
there are 46 other @entity27 girls who also escaped @entity8 , but there are no funds available to pay for their education			1
dr. @entity80 , the school 's vice-chancellor , is hoping to change that by raising funds through the university 's foundation			2
" the world paid , and rightly so , a lot of attention to the close to 300 that were kidnapped , " she says			0
" we heard through various people that some had escaped that night and when it came to our attention that about a dozen wanted to come to @entity2 , we thought , we can do that ! " she did more then just raise the funds			2
when the parents agreed to release their girls into her care , she and her security director traveled -- just the two of them -- to the outskirts of @entity27 to go and get the girls , in spite of the insecurity			2
even on campus , though , the specter of @entity8 is never far away			1
the @entity2 is in @entity109 , one of the states in @entity31 that is under a state of emergency			0
this calls for constant vigilance at the school : cars are searched by hand and guards and sniffer dogs are on constant patrol			2
for the girls , to remain in school , they must draw upon all their reserves of courage			1
it is a reality these extraordinarily self - possessed young ladies softly acknowledge			0
when i ask how it is they are able to persevere , one girl says with a slight smile , " i 'm very brave and determined			0
but they 're hoping a day will come when they wo n't have to be .			0
