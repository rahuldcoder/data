a manager at an @entity2 has been placed on paid administrative leave after sending a " completely and totally unacceptable " email apparently mocking mental illness			1
the email , sent by @entity16 , " in no way reflects the attitudes of our staff toward our patients , " @entity7 director @entity6 said in a statement posted on the hospital 's facebook page			1
@entity16 , a licensed clinical social worker , had been managing the @entity18 , which is responsible for assisting new veterans with their @entity21 benefits , services and programs , to include mental health , according to the @entity25			1
her email , first published by the @entity28 this week , was sent december 18 to members of her team and shows four photos of an elf in different scenarios			1
two of the photos have struck a nerve with the veterans and mental illness communities			1
in one photograph , the elf appears leaning over what looks like a straw and coffee grounds on a paper plate , with a post-it note that says , " out of @entity45 - please help ! " the caption reads , " self - medicating for mental health issues when a @entity48 would not give him his requested script			1
" in another , the elf is hanging from a string of @entity54 lights			1
" caught in the act of suicidal behavior ( trying to hang himself from an electrical cord ) , " the caption says			0
@entity60 is a veteran of the @entity61 and @entity62 and serves as a leader at an @entity65 post			0
he said the email makes him sick and angry			2
" i ca n't understand anybody who would do anything like this to us , " @entity60 told @entity1 affiliate @entity67			0
hospital leadership was allegedly made aware of the email a couple of months ago , according to the @entity28 , and had " administratively addressed " the incident with @entity16			1
but since the story went viral , the @entity77 page has been inundated with commenters calling for @entity16 to be fired			2
@entity80 on @entity77 said , " @entity16 's continued employment is an insult to every veteran who has served this country			1
" @entity6 announced @entity16 's leave , and a pending investigation , tuesday evening			1
but many say it 's not enough			2
" firing her would be the first step in showing you are truly committed to the veterans ' health and well - being			2
action speaks louder than words , " @entity95 wrote on @entity77			0
two of the country 's largest veterans organizations have also criticized @entity16 's actions			1
" it is absolutely inexcusable that a @entity21 supervisor would make light of any issue that veterans face , " @entity25 national commander @entity103 said in a statement			0
" the @entity25 demands she be replaced as program manager			0
" the @entity65 also expressed their discontent , saying they take " health care for veterans very seriously			2
" " veterans suffering from @entity118 and ptsd should not be held up to ridicule , " their statement read			0
@entity120 was one of a few who came to the hospital 's defense			2
" as a veteran who receives care at the @entity126 , i find this apology to be acceptable			0
we 're all prone to doing stupid things			0
i 'm sure ms. @entity130 has received a reprimand for her actions			0
she does n't need to lose her job			0
now , let 's move on , " he wrote on the @entity21 's @entity77 page			2
@entity6 , who was not available for comment wednesday , did not elaborate on the investigation into the incident , or why it took so long to move forward with placing @entity16 on leave , but instead asked for forgiveness			1
" i ask veterans to accept my apology for this failure , and to allow us to continue to demonstrate to you our commitment to your health and well - being , " he said			0
this incident is the latest in what has been a tumultuous year for the @entity21			0
@entity1 's months - long investigation into deaths due to long wait times for veterans at @entity21 hospitals led to the resignation of @entity21 secretary @entity159			0
@entity1 's attempts to reach @entity16 were unanswered as of wednesday afternoon .			1
