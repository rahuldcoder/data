@entity0 apparently claimed responsibility thursday for the deadly terrorist attack at a landmark museum in the heart of that country 's capital , a mass shooting that has shaken the birthplace of the @entity10 and stirred questions about militants in the country			1
in an audio statement posted online thursday , @entity0 identified two men -- @entity16 and @entity17 -- it said used " automatic weapons and hand grenades " to kill and injure what it called " crusaders and apostates " in the @entity23 in @entity24			1
@entity28 health minister @entity27 said 23 people are believed to have been killed , including at least one who died at a hospital overnight			1
and that bloodshed , the @entity0 message warned , is " just the start			1
" @entity1 can not independently verify the legitimacy of the audio statement			0
a @entity38 official told @entity1 there is no reason to doubt the claim 's authenticity			0
that said , @entity38 officials are checking the platform that the statement went out on , including the extent to which it 's tied to the group calling itself the @entity50			0
the current @entity38 thinking is the attack may have been carried out by local " franchise " adherents to @entity0 , rather than centrally directed by the @entity56 extremist group 's leadership , which is now thought to be in @entity57			1
the two attackers were carrying explosives , @entity28 president @entity59 said in an interview thursday with the @entity65 broadcaster @entity63			1
he credited @entity28 security forces for responding so quickly to the attack to avoid a larger tragedy because " terrible explosives were found on these ( attackers ) and they did n't have time to use them			1
" @entity28 has been viewed as the lone democratic success story in the @entity10			1
but the @entity75 nation is not without its issues , including an uneven economy and the distinction of having more citizens -- up to 3,000 @entity28 -- thought to have gone to @entity80 and @entity57 to fight as jihadists than any other country , according to the @entity83 for the @entity84 in @entity85			2
authorities there have already arrested nine people in connection with wednesday 's attack , including four directly linked to the bloodshed , according to a statement from @entity93			1
earlier thursday , @entity28 prime minister @entity94 identified two suspects , @entity96 and @entity97 , in an interview with @entity65 radio station @entity99			2
it 's not clear if those two men were the pair killed at the museum by @entity28 security forces , or if it 's possible they 're the same people as those identified -- using new names -- in @entity0 ' audio statement			1
@entity96 was " known to the security services , he was flagged and monitored , " @entity94 said			0
but he added the man was n't known or being followed for anything special			0
the siege took place just days after a @entity28 jihadist tweeted that a pledge of allegiance to @entity117 , the leader of @entity0 , was coming soon , according to the @entity118 , which monitors terrorist propaganda			1
in his message , the jihadist claimed to belong to @entity121 in @entity28 , a group that in december pledged allegiance to @entity0 , even though that vow had n't seemed to have fully registered with the @entity56 extremist group			1
his post comes after an @entity0 fighter in the extremist group 's stronghold of @entity130 in @entity57 recently appeared in a video questioning why militants in @entity28 had not pledged fealty			1
" this raises the possibility that the museum attack could be @entity0 ' debut on the @entity28 stage , timed to precede a pledge of allegiance from @entity28 jihadis for maximum impact , " @entity1 terrorism analyst @entity134 said			1
the attack may have been in and about @entity28 , but the vast majority of the victims were foreigners			1
they came from various backgrounds , from a @entity151 couple to a @entity153 mother and son			0
in addition to those pairs , the dead included three @entity158 , three @entity159 , two @entity65 , two @entity160 , a @entity161 , a @entity162 and a @entity163 , according to cruise ship companies and their respective governments			0
three @entity28 , one of them a security officer and another a job applicant , also were killed , according to @entity27			2
twelve of those killed had been aboard the @entity172 , a cruise ship with more than 3,700 passengers and nearly 1,300 crew that docked in @entity24 hours before the bloodshed , its parent company said in a statement			0
five more victims came from a similar vessel , the @entity180 , which was at port in the @entity28 capital at the same time , according to @entity183			2
another 36 people remain hospitalized , while eight others were treated and released			0
the @entity186 had been a logical stop for these tourists , housed next to @entity28 's @entity189 in a 19th century palace and cast as a " jewel of @entity28 heritage , " with its exhibits showcasing the country 's art , culture and history			2
its prominent place in @entity28 's economy -- which banks heavily on tourism , with millions visiting the country each year -- also made it a logical target for terrorists			1
" they hit the heart of our livelihood , " said @entity207 , a taxi driver in @entity24			0
it 's too early to tell how tourists will react to the attack			0
both the @entity172 and the @entity180 have since left @entity24 , even as the search continues for some of their missing passengers -- at least four from the @entity172 and two from the @entity180 , according to their respective companies			0
the question is whether more passenger - packed cruise ships , as well as commercial airliners filled with tourists , will come to @entity28 in the future			2
travelers warned of risks as @entity28 reels from attack the economy and terrorism are linked in @entity28 , in the sense that high youth unemployment and sparse opportunities are thought to have contributed to the large numbers becoming jihadists -- whether abroad or at home			1
attacking what @entity28 lawmaker @entity238 called " a symbol of sovereignty in @entity28 " likely wo n't help			2
" it 's really sad , " @entity238 told @entity1 from @entity24 , " and i hope that it wo n't really affect our economy			0
" the government has been battling a jihadist presence in the @entity247			0
and in february , the country 's @entity248 announced the arrests of about 100 alleged extremists and published a video allegedly showing that the group possessed a formula for making explosives and a photograph of @entity0 leader @entity117			1
@entity257 , another parliamentarian , says it 's imperative that the message gets across to would - be jihadists that " life in democracy is better than " what terrorist recruiters are telling them			0
" we have really to work on the culture , the level of ideas , " she said			0
meanwhile , she and others stressed that the vast majority of @entity28 -- including secular - minded citizens and moderate @entity273 -- need to come together for their country and against these extremist views and tactics			2
" they are trying to terrify us			0
but the whole @entity28 people is unified -- all the parties , all the civil society organizations , all the countries are unified , " @entity238 said			2
" ... i 'm sure that we will fight terrorism and that we will really eradicate it from our country			0
" @entity1 's @entity286 , @entity287 , @entity288 , @entity289 , @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity292 and journalists @entity293 and @entity295 contributed to this report .			0
