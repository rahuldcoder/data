we have no problem taking @entity4 executives to task for decisions that leave @entity8 families financially devastated , yet we give @entity9 billionaires a pass when they do the same thing			1
@entity8 needs to realize that instead of creating jobs , @entity9 is erasing them , leaving millennials financially stranded before their careers can get off the ground			1
@entity9 is tossing millennials aside like yesterday 's laptop			1
the commonly held belief is that with hard work and a good education , a young person in @entity8 can get a good job			2
but despite falling unemployment , college grads age 22 to 27 are stuck in low - paying jobs that do n't even require a college degree			1
the percentage of young people languishing in low - skill , low - paying jobs is 44 % , a 20 - year high			1
only 36 % of college grads have jobs that pay at least $ 45,000 , a sharp decline from the 1990s , after adjusting for inflation			1
perhaps most depressingly , the percentage of young people making below $ 25,000 has topped 20 % , worse than in 1990			2
in other words , those with a bachelor 's diploma were better off before the digital revolution			2
if this comes as a surprise , that 's because images from popular culture push the idea that young college graduates are shrugging off bad employment prospects with their do - it - yourself attitude			1
in our collective imagination , millennials are saying , " no jobs ? that 's ok — i 'll create my own ! " and then they solve their own problems by heading to @entity9 with little more than an @entity62 and an idea to create the next hip app that supposedly will turn them into overnight millionaires			1
a fictional example of this new breed of young idealistic entrepreneur would be @entity70 , founder of internet behemoth @entity72 on the show " @entity74			2
" played by @entity75 , @entity70 might best be described as " barefoot and pregnant with ideas			0
" the bumbling entrepreneur conquers the world practically by accident , armed only with his digital savvy , a can - do spirit , and a penchant for invading users ' privacy			2
you get the idea that his success came easily			0
privacy concerns aside , the @entity89 of @entity8 are just about as rare as the @entity91			0
in fact , the percentage of people under 30 who own private businesses has reached a 24 - year low			2
garages across the country are not exactly humming with millennials launching tech startups			0
but wait — wo n't the digital economy eventually lead to better jobs ? after a period of adjustment , wo n't things get better ? unfortunately that 's not the path we 're on			1
one of the biggest misconceptions about the digital economy is that for every middle - class job rendered obsolete by technology , there 's a new , equally good ( or better ) job created by @entity9			1
but exactly the opposite is happening			0
the digital economy is vaporizing the good jobs and replacing them with two kinds of jobs : minimum wage jobs ( think @entity121 warehouse employees ) and so - called " sharing - economy jobs " ( think @entity123 drivers )			1
the sharing - economy jobs are even worse than minimum wage jobs because they offer no stability or protections for workers			1
sharing economy jobs are n't really jobs at all ; they 're freelance gigs			2
sure , @entity9 does n't owe @entity8 jobs			1
but something is wrong with the picture of a handful of tech billionaires overseeing a kingdom of falling wages , decreased worker protection and zero job security			0
this " winner - take - all " digital economy is not sustainable			0
people on both sides of the political spectrum are worried			0
liberal luminary @entity144 , a professor at the @entity146 and former secretary of labor under @entity148 , calls the sharing economy the " share - the - scraps " economy			0
speaking of tech companies that utilize on - demand labor , such as @entity123 , @entity154 and @entity155 , he says , " the big money goes to the corporations that own the software			0
the scraps go to the on - demand workers			0
" meanwhile , conservative columnist @entity160 fears a dystopian future in which " a rich , technologically proficient society will no longer offer meaningful occupation to many people of ordinary talents			0
" put simply , @entity9 's utopia is the rest of @entity8 's dystopia			1
and those who are punished more than anyone else are recent college graduates , whose lifetime earning potential has already suffered an irreversible setback			1
and if you think your own job is safe , think again			0
new research predicts that nearly half of all jobs are susceptible to automation over the next two decades			0
this is a giant leap backward , but it 's deceptively described as technological " progress			0
" as anyone who 's talked to an automated system on the phone lately can attest , " automated " usually means " worse			0
" what can be done ? how can we fight this slide back toward the @entity187 ? if we take no action , we 're headed toward a kind of digital world feudalism where there are a handful of kings , a lot of peasants and no middle class			2
there 's no easy fix , but we can do three things immediately			0
first , we can stop glorifying tech titans and start talking openly about @entity9 's questionable tactics and its real job creation record ( i.e. , just follow the numbers )			1
second , we can encourage more lawsuits against the abusive practices of " sharing - economy " powerhouses			0
third , we can elect leaders who are vocal about holding @entity9 accountable for their power over the entire @entity8 workforce , including white - collar employees			1
the fictional @entity72 's tagline borrows some millennial slang : " would n't it be tight if everyone was chill to each other ? " indeed it would			2
and if we want a better future for millennials and the generations after them , we need to challenge the prevailing @entity9 ethos before it 's too late .			1

@entity223 : @entity9 does n't create jobs ; it 's *wiping* out middle - class jobs
young college graduates are struggling with lack of jobs , yet many still *idolize* @entity9
