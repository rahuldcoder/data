@entity1 forces appear to be slowly closing in on an important tactical victory against @entity4			1
but as they press forward in their attempt to retake the city of @entity9 from @entity4 insurgents , there is an important question that the @entity12 and its allies should be asking : could this victory actually undermine the only sustainable strategy for ensuring @entity1 's stability ? the reality is that short - term tactical victories wo n't be enough to defeat @entity4 , especially as the reliance on @entity22 - backed @entity21 militias is only likely to exacerbate tensions with the largely local @entity25 population			1
indeed , the crucial ground war component of the campaign has so far been heavily reliant on the @entity21 militias , whose track record of sectarian violence is well - documented , and their involvement threatens to drive more @entity1 sunnis into the arms of @entity4			1
gen. @entity34 , chairman of the @entity35 , has said the involvement of these groups " will only be a problem if it results in sectarianism			0
" but based on past experience , many locals are understandably more frightened by their designated " liberators " than they are of the vicious extremists of @entity4 who have ruled their towns over the past eight months			2
historically , @entity1 has n't always needed @entity21 militias under @entity22 's command to fight @entity25 extremists			1
@entity49 was expelled from northern @entity1 in 2007 , when its harsh rule antagonized tribal leaders that had supported the anti- @entity12 insurgency , prompting them to make common cause with the @entity12 in what became known as the " awakening " movement			2
unfortunately , once its goal had been achieved , @entity57 rounded on @entity59 , betraying promises of integration into the national army and polity and instead arresting and killing its leaders along with trusted sunni elected representatives			0
the @entity12 looked the other way , deeming it a " domestic " political matter			0
that simply emboldened then - prime minister @entity70 to deepen his purge of sunni elected representatives , and to parlay the 2010 election result into a governing coalition despite his own list drawing fewer votes than a rival bloc that included many @entity25 leaders			0
this undermined the work that the @entity12 had done in persuading @entity1 's @entity25 that fighting @entity49 and voting in elections was the best way to advance their communal interests			2
put simply , @entity70 's actions made a mockery of any @entity25 confidence in the electoral system or the national government			0
it was the resulting @entity25 alienation that allowed @entity49 's successor , @entity4 , back into those communities			2
the growing fear among many @entity25 has been compounded by prime minister @entity94 's statement to parliament that any @entity1 choosing to stay neutral was effectively aligning themselves with @entity4 -- remarks that create an atmosphere that enables violence against ordinary @entity25 , many of whom feel caught between the extremists and a @entity21 - led government from which they have been systematically oppressed and alienated			1
and @entity4 has undoubtedly capitalized on the permissive environment created by such alienation , which persists despite the @entity109 administration having convinced itself that @entity94 would somehow prove to be more inclusive than his predecessors from the same @entity21 @entity112 party			2
all this suggests that the " awakening " experience , which showed that @entity1 @entity25 will reject violent extremists if they believe they will get a fair shake from the system for doing so , is as vital as ever to the prospects of defeating @entity4			1
but the outcome must be different from the last awakening			0
sunnis willing to fight @entity4 should be given control over their own affairs in northern @entity1 in the way that @entity127 aspirations have been accommodated			1
the alternative , of relying on sectarian forces to drive out the extremists , is more likely to ensure their return than to prevent it			0
getting to a new political order in @entity1 that offers the prospect of sustainable stability and progress will require compromise , not only among @entity1 but also among the regional sponsors of its contending factions -- @entity1 has become a key battleground in the regional struggle between camps led by @entity22 and the @entity143			0
creating a political order capable of stabilizing @entity1 will require a new security " grand bargain " negotiated between the key stakeholders			0
short - term tactical victories wo n't defeat @entity4 , and militia involvement will more likely strengthen its appeal			1
the reality is that ultimately , only a political deal that guarantees @entity1 @entity25 ' inclusion , equality and protection -- one that is implemented by @entity22 and its allied @entity1 militia -- can resolve the @entity4 problem			1
and unless all of the key stakeholders are willing to negotiate a new way of living together , @entity1 is likely to remain a battleground where the @entity12 finds itself inadvertently reinforcing the problem .			0
