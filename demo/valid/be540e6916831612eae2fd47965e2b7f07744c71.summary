@entity2 @entity1 's ultra-radical fringe has come back to bite a government born out of the most successful experiment in constitutional reform to emerge from the 2011 @entity8 revolutions			1
wednesday 's attack on the @entity10 in @entity11 was grimly predictable , coming from what the @entity12 calls a violent ultra-radical @entity15 fringe forced underground -- but not crushed -- by security services			1
@entity18 firebrands representing thousands of active militants at home and abroad have been threatening retribution on @entity1 's outward - looking , investment - friendly majority			1
the attack was carried out by two gunmen , believed to have been supported by at least two accomplices			0
it may torpedo efforts to revive @entity1 's employment - generating tourism industry and may discourage other big - spending visitors			1
it will probably lead @entity1 -- who have shown a sage propensity to unite in the face of greatest adversity despite a marked appetite for political bickering -- to support a robust response by elected president @entity39			1
the attack adds to the global narrative by which @entity43 revolutionaries -- increasingly flying under the flag of the so - called @entity45 ( @entity46 ) -- pose an existential crisis to moderate states , often @entity50 allies , in the @entity52 world			0
@entity1 is the sole country to have emerged from an @entity8 revolution with its political process intact -- current president , @entity39 , who was elected in november 2014 , and his ruling coalition , are the products of a long constitutional process			1
in four tumultuous years they have competed hard with , but also showed a capacity to work with , opposition parties , led by the " moderate @entity15 " @entity62 , which is represented in government and parliament			0
islamists of a very different hue were responsible for the @entity68 attack			0
local @entity70 groups ( of whom the best known is @entity78 ) as well as multinational units including @entity46 have been most effective in recruiting disaffected young @entity1 in the capital 's poorer quarters and in dusty towns of the south and interior , where the original revolution that removed @entity77 in february 2011 surged up			1
@entity81 claims for more jobs and resources in these underprivileged areas during the four subsequent years have largely come to nothing , adding to frustrations			0
radical jihadists -- some with back bases in @entity89 and @entity90 -- have posed a major security challenge to successive governments , murdering two prominent " secular " politicians in 2013			0
the @entity1 armed forces , supported by @entity90 's more experienced and better equipped military , have been fighting jihadist radicals in the @entity98 region for nearly three years			2
they have yet to declare final victory , pointing to the resilience of underground groups			0
while successive governments have acted against radical @entity70 groups , thousands of @entity1 have gone underground ; they are widely believed to make up the biggest national group fighting with jihadists in @entity105 ( over 3,000 by many accounts ) , and are present in @entity89 and other failing states			2
in january 2013 , tunisians and @entity89 made up the majority of jihadists who attacked a strategic gas plant operated by @entity111 and @entity112 in southern @entity90			0
so , the @entity68 attackers are a known enemy			0
prime minister @entity115 has promised a robust security response			2
but the @entity11 tragedy is unlikely to have any immediate impact on the political process			0
a majority of @entity1 remain foursquare behind preserving " republican institutions , " even if they vocally disagree on the detail of policy			2
it will remind @entity1 's many friends that the country 's transition is brittle , and that @entity11 needs commitments of support to become reality , with more military and wider financial assistance , and , above all , investment that can kickstart an economy in the doldrums since 2011			1
massacre at the @entity68 places @entity1 more centrally within the global @entity46 narrative , which has recently expanded to neighboring @entity89			2
it is a ghastly way to remind the world that @entity1 's experiment in democratic reform needs all the help it can get .			1

@entity145 : ultra-radical fringe has *previously* threatened @entity1 's liberal majority
majority of @entity1 likely to support robust response from president , he writes
attacks a reminder that @entity1 's transition to democracy is " brittle , " @entity145 says
