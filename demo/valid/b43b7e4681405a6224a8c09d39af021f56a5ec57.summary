@entity1 it might sound like a really old wives ' tale , but a thousand - year - old @entity6 potion for eye infections may hold the key to wiping out the modern - day superbug @entity9 , according to new research			1
the 10th - century " eyesalve " remedy was discovered at the @entity13 in a leather - bound volume of @entity16 's @entity15 , widely considered to be one of the earliest known medical textbooks			1
@entity19 , an expert on @entity6 society from the @entity21 at the @entity22 , translated the ancient manuscript despite some ambiguities in the text			1
" we chose this recipe in @entity32 because it contains ingredients such as garlic that are currently investigated by other researchers on their potential antibiotic effectiveness , " @entity26 said in a video posted on the university 's website			1
" and so we looked at a recipe that is fairly straightforward			2
it 's also a recipe where we are told it 's the ' best of leechdoms ' -- how could you not test that ? so we were curious			2
" @entity26 enlisted the help of the university 's microbiologists to see if the remedy actually worked			2
the recipe calls for two species of @entity48 ( garlic and onion or leek ) , wine and oxgall ( bile from a cow 's stomach ) to be brewed in a brass vessel			1
" we recreated the recipe as faithfully as we could			2
the @entity16 gives very precise instructions for the ratio of different ingredients and for the way they should be combined before use , so we tried to follow that as closely as possible , " said microbiologist @entity58 , who led the work in the lab at the @entity61			0
the book included an instruction for the recipe to be left to stand for nine days before being strained through a cloth			1
efforts to replicate the recipe exactly included finding wine from a vineyard known to have existed in the ninth century , according to @entity77 , an associate professor of sociomicrobiology , who also worked on the project			1
the researchers then tested their recipe on cultures of @entity9 , methicillin - resistant @entity82 , a type of staph bacterium that does not respond to commonly used antibiotic treatments			1
the scientists were n't holding out much hope that it would work -- but they were astonished by the lab results			0
" what we found was very interesting -- we found that @entity16 's eyesalve is incredibly potent as an @entity93 antibiotic in this context , " @entity88 said			2
" we were going from a mature , established population of a few billion cells , all stuck together in this highly protected biofilm coat , to really just a few thousand cells left alive			0
this is a massive , massive killing ability			0
" @entity77 said the team also asked collaborators in the @entity103 to test the recipe using an " in vivo " wound model -- meaning it 's in a live organism -- " and basically the big surprise was that it seems to be more effective than conventional antibiotic treatment			2
" the scientists were worried they would n't be able to repeat the feat. but three more batches , made from scratch each time , have yielded the same results , @entity88 said , and the salve appears to retain its potency for a long time after being stored in bottles in the refrigerator			0
the team says it now has good , replicated data showing that the medicine kills up to 90 % of @entity9 bacteria in " in vivo " wound biopsies from mice			1
@entity88 says the researchers are still not completely sure how it works , but they have a few ideas -- namely , that there might be several active components in the mixture that work to attack the bacterial cells on different fronts , making it very hard for them to resist ; or that by combining the ingredients and leaving them to steep in alcohol , a new , more potent bacteria - fighting molecule is created in the process			1
" i still ca n't quite believe how well this 1,000 - year - old antibiotic actually seems to be working , " @entity88 said			0
" when we got the first results we were just utterly dumbfounded			0
we did not see this coming at all			0
" she added : " obviously you can never say with utter certainty that because it works in the lab it 's going to work as an antibiotic , but the potential of this to take on to the next stage and say , ' yeah , really does it work as an antibiotic ' is just beyond my wildest dreams , to be honest			0
" @entity26 , who translated the text from @entity154 , believes the discovery could change people 's views of the medieval period as the " @entity159			0
" " @entity160 are often seen as the ' @entity159 ' -- we use the term ' medieval ' these days ... as pejorative -- and i just wanted to do something that explains to me how people in the @entity160 looked at science , " she said .			0

researchers say a medieval remedy made of garlic , onion , wine , bile may be able to defeat @entity9 superbug
ancient recipe was found in 10th - century medical book at the @entity13
