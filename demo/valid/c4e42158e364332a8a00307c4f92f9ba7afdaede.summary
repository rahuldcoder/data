@entity2 if it looks like a treaty , walks like a treaty and talks like a treaty , is it a treaty ? according to the @entity9 , only if the @entity8 says it is			1
that 's infuriating @entity11 and even some @entity12 , who are demanding that the @entity15 administration submit any final nuclear deal with @entity17 to @entity18 for approval			1
" this is clearly a treaty , " @entity21 sen. @entity20 told reporters tuesday			2
" they can call it a banana , but it 's a treaty			2
" @entity27 denounces @entity11 letter to @entity17 leaders the @entity11 position could jeopardize the long - term survival of any @entity17 deal , and it represents the party 's newest clash with president @entity15 over the limits of executive authority , as @entity11 object to a pact they warn could eventually give @entity38 a nuclear bomb			1
it 's that skepticism that has largely led the @entity9 to define the deal as a " nonbinding agreement " rather than a " treaty , " which the @entity44 requires @entity47 " advice and consent " on			1
the distinction -- and whether it can legitimately be used to shut out @entity18 -- turns on complicated and unresolved questions of constitutional law			1
while @entity11 call foul , the administration defends the differentiation as perfectly sound , and no surprise			2
secretary of state @entity27 stressed wednesday that the administration never intended to negotiate a treaty			2
" we 've been clear from the beginning			0
we 're not negotiating a ' legally binding plan			0
' we 're negotiating a plan that will have in it a capacity for enforcement , " he said at a @entity47 hearing			0
that does n't sit well with @entity11 , many of whom believe the @entity47 's constitutional role is being bypassed			0
@entity69 sen. @entity68 dismissed the administration 's argument : " let there be no mistake , this is a treaty that is being negotiated			0
it 's a treaty and should be treated as such			0
" did 47 @entity11 senators break the law in plain sight ? @entity11 see criticism of the administration 's maneuver as a way to gum up the works on the current deal , and to push their larger assault on the @entity9 's exercise of power			1
at the @entity47 hearing wednesday , @entity90 @entity11 @entity89 explicitly tied the administration 's bid to keep the deal away from @entity18 to other accusations of @entity9 overreach			1
" this is an administration that seeks to legislate when that is not in their purview , whether it be immigration , whether it be health care , " he charged , noting that he had joined 46 other @entity11 senators in signing a letter to the @entity98 informing them of @entity18 's role in approving binding agreements			1
" i signed the letter to @entity17			0
but you know what ? the message i was sending was to you , " he told @entity27			0
" i signed it to an administration that does n't listen , to an administration that , every turn , tries to go around @entity18 because you think you ca n't get your way			1
" but legal experts say that though a court challenge along the lines of pending @entity11 cases on immigration and health care is possible in theory , it would be a long shot			0
there is no currently no suit on the issue being discussed on @entity131 , and it 's far from clear that @entity11 would be standing on firm legal ground with such a challenge			0
the debate , rumbling for decades , has yet to be definitively resolved in case law			0
" it is a very interesting question , " said @entity136 , a former senior @entity137 diplomat , arguing that it is essentially up to the administration to decide whether it is negotiating an agreement that formally binds the @entity137 to commitments under international law ; i.e. , a treaty , or a less stringent arrangement			1
senators grill @entity15 officials on @entity17 @entity149 , a specialist on the @entity17 nuclear program at the @entity151 , said the @entity17 deal , which commits the @entity137 to waive or lift sanctions , does not rise to the level of a formal treaty			1
" treaties traditionally have involved reductions in armaments , nuclear weapons , conventional forces			0
they require us to take something away that we have already built or established			0
" in this case , the @entity137 would lift sanctions , but would not be changing its military posture			0
" we have had all sorts of agreement that were never ratified by @entity18 , " @entity167 said			1
but @entity170 , a constitutional and international law expert who worked for president @entity171 , said that any international agreement requiring major undertakings on the part of the @entity137 -- such as the proposed @entity17 deal -- must be sent to the @entity47 for advice and consent			1
" the @entity44 is quite clear , " he said			0
@entity11 point to none less than the vice president of the @entity137 to bolster their case			1
when vice president @entity180 was a senator in 2002 , he wrote a letter to then - secretary of state @entity182 charging that a planned strategic arms reductions deal with @entity185 constituted a treaty subject to @entity47 approval since it would require " significant obligations by the @entity137			1
" but @entity180 's 2002 letter did n't keep him from unleashing his fury at the @entity11 letter to @entity17 on monday			0
" around the world , @entity137 's influence depends on its ability to honor its commitments , " @entity180 said in a statement			0
while @entity18 approves some agreements , " as the authors of this letter must know , the vast majority of our international commitments take effect without congressional approval			1
" indeed , in the letter he penned to @entity17 , @entity206 sen. @entity205 acknowledged that the administration could seek a mere " executive agreement " free of congressional review			2
@entity15 , @entity17 official slam @entity11 letter on deal presidents claim inherent powers to conclude executive agreements under @entity217 of the @entity44			2
@entity137 law stipulates that an agreement is only viewed as a treaty once it has been made with " the advice and consent of the @entity47 , " a study by the nonpartisan @entity219 noted			2
but administrations often choose to conclude deals with foreign states that do n't satisfy that requirement			0
such an " executive agreement " is still considered a treaty that is binding under international law , but does not reach the same standard under @entity137 law , according to the study			2
examples of " nonbinding " documents include a @entity137 - @entity185 to remove @entity237 's stocks of chemical weapons and the @entity239 to stop the global shipment of the weapons of mass destruction components			0
@entity180 argued monday that this practice is as old as the @entity137 itself			0
" under presidents of both parties , such major shifts in @entity137 foreign policy as diplomatic recognition of the @entity252 , the resolution of the @entity17 hostage crisis , and the conclusion of the @entity256 were all conducted without congressional approval , " he said in his statement opposing the @entity11 letter			0
the @entity9 would clearly prefer a binding agreement with @entity17 , which would have a better chance of longevity			1
but the strength of opposition in @entity18 makes that route impossible			1
according to republicans such as @entity205 , the only deal the @entity47 would approve is one that completely bans @entity17 uranium enrichment			1
@entity15 has said that goal is simply not realistic			0
so @entity11 , dissatisfied with what 's emerging from negotiations , are seizing on the vulnerability of a deal that lacks treaty status			2
many see that as a more viable path for disruption than the case on administration overreach			0
" if @entity18 does n't approve this deal , @entity18 wo n't accept this deal , now or in the future , " @entity205 told @entity3			1
in the letter , he informed @entity17 leaders that many senators will serve terms longer than @entity15 , so they would have to reckon with the @entity47 at some point			2
lawmakers can refuse to lift sanctions down the road or try to choke off funds for the deal 's implementation			2
the administration acknowledges that @entity18 will have to get involved at some point			1
@entity15 currently has the power to lift or waive certain sanctions against @entity17 for the duration of his presidency and encourage @entity137 international partners to follow suit			0
but he does not have the power to lift sanctions imposed by @entity18 , which include some of the most punitive measures against @entity17			1
" part of the agreement is going to involve sanctions relief to the @entity17 government that is meted out over time , " deputy national security adviser @entity304 told @entity3			2
" at some time in the duration of this agreement , @entity18 will have to be heard on sanctions relief			1
" senior @entity137 officials have acknowledged that the clamor among lawmakers for a role , as well as their public criticisms , also implicitly highlights the vulnerability of their case and an ultimate agreement			2
@entity320 , a @entity12 senator from @entity321 who has signed onto a bill calling for the @entity9 to put any deal up for a vote in @entity18 , said that @entity15 is within his rights to do what he is doing -- up to a point			1
" it is not a treaty			0
if it were a treaty , there is a clear process			0
it would require a two - thirds vote in the @entity47			0
" but @entity320 told @entity3 on wednesday that lawmakers did have a role to play at the point when sanctions mandated by @entity18 are bargained away to ensure @entity17 sticks to limits on its nuclear program			1
" @entity18 has got to weigh in at some point , " @entity320 said .			1

@entity9 , many republicans disagree over deal *terminology* , requirements
at some point , @entity18 will weigh in on some aspect of a *prospective* agreement
