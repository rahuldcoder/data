it has been one of the world 's longest and deadliest civil conflicts			0
since the first incidents more than three decades ago , an estimated 40,000 lives have been lost			0
it has been , some say , a battle by activists among @entity12 's @entity11 minority for independence			1
it has been , others say , a guerrilla war by rebels who have punctuated their campaign with terrorist acts			0
whatever it has been to the parties involved , the leader of the militant group at the forefront of the @entity11 insurgency in @entity12 says it is time now for it to be over			1
" our struggle came to the point it can not continue as it is , " @entity26 , longtime leader of the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) , said earlier in march from his jail cell			2
in a letter read to thousands gathered in the southeastern @entity12 city of @entity35 to mark @entity36 , @entity26 called for " a new era " with @entity38 gathering as " a democratic society with the right to a democratic identity -- within @entity12 and on the constitutional citizenship basis			1
" he urged fighters under his command to lay down their arms , stop their war against the @entity12 state and join a " congress " to focus on the future			2
@entity26 's letter is nothing less than historic			0
as recently as 2012 , the long - simmering war between the @entity27 and the @entity12 government had heated to the point that the @entity55 , a conflict resolution organization monitoring the conflict , counted more than 700 dead over 14 months			1
" we 're seeing the longest pitched battles between the ( @entity12 ) army and the @entity27 , we 're seeing a widespread campaign of kidnapping , suicide bombings and terrorist attacks by the @entity27			1
they 're very much on the offensive and unfortunately this is matched by much harder line rhetoric on both sides , " @entity64 , chief author of an @entity55 report , told @entity1 in 2012			0
perhaps vocally underscoring the cultural split between the @entity12 government and the country 's @entity11 population , when @entity26 's letter was read to crowds march 21 , it was read in two languages -- @entity11 first , then @entity12			1
the letter was read by @entity78 , deputy of @entity12 's @entity79			1
@entity78 is one of the few people regularly allowed to meet @entity26 at the prison where he is held on @entity82			0
" saturday officially showed us all that we have moved on to the negotiation period from the dialogue period we 've been working on , " @entity78 told @entity1 in a phone interview			0
about a fifth of @entity12 's population is @entity11 -- a minority long living under cultural oppression , most of them in the underdeveloped southeastern part of @entity12			1
by 1998 -- 14 years after the insurgency began -- @entity12 counted up to 18,000 @entity27 guerrillas living in the mountains			1
the next year , @entity26 -- a hero to some , a villain to others -- was captured in @entity100 by @entity12 authorities , reportedly with the help of the @entity103			2
the @entity104 , the @entity105 and @entity12 classify the @entity27 as a terrorist group			1
@entity26 was sentenced by the @entity12 government to life in prison for treason , and for years , he was the sole prisoner of @entity82			1
it 's an @entity112 - like island fortress best known in the @entity113 as the locale for the 1970s book and movie " @entity117			0
" now , he gets to choose fellow inmates			0
@entity26 began the @entity27 in 1978 as a @entity11 separatist group in @entity12 , part of a larger separatist movement by @entity38 scattered throughout the region			1
@entity123 , southern @entity12 and northern @entity124 have been home to millions of @entity38 for thousands of years			2
there are also millions of @entity38 in @entity127 , where they make up about 10 % of the mostly @entity130 nation 's population			1
violence flared in august 1984 when fighters from the @entity27 , which has a @entity134 philosophy , killed two @entity12 soldiers			1
as the years passed and the death toll mounted , the @entity27 proved to be a militant leg of a regional ethnic struggle to carry on the @entity11 culture			2
but there have been periods of calm and times of talk			0
in 2009 , @entity12 intelligence officials allegedly met with high - ranking @entity27 members in @entity147 , @entity148 , to begin a series of secret talks			2
in mid- 2011 , the talks were interrupted by new clashes			0
the armed fights were followed by a hunger strike by @entity11 political prisoners in 2012 , who ended the strike after 67 days upon @entity26 's request			0
things picked back up when president @entity160 announced talks with the imprisoned @entity26 in december 2012			0
since then , the @entity12 government has lifted language bans , released political prisoners and continued talks with @entity26 despite opposition criticism			1
in return , the jailed leader notably pronounced disarmament intentions and called for a ceasefire in his @entity36 's letter in 2013			2
on may 8 of that year , the @entity27 announced a slow withdrawal from @entity12			2
but tensions between the sides sparked again when the predominantly @entity11 - populated city of @entity176 was invaded by @entity177 in october and @entity12 did n't directly intervene			2
talks between the @entity27 and the @entity12 government continued , though			1
but at @entity182 's @entity181 last month , senior government officials met with @entity184 parliamentarians and declared a " road map " accord on the way to a stable solution			0
@entity78 said that @entity26 's letter " shows us that the ... road map decided at @entity181 is now a concrete step -- one that suits the spirit and the context of the resolution period			0
" but the government view over the accord seems to be divided			0
@entity160 told reporters that he does not fancy the declaration			0
@entity160 was not present at @entity181 either			0
@entity78 said , " despite the president 's opposing remarks , the @entity12 government took responsibility about its @entity11 problem for the first time			1

@entity38 make up about a fifth of @entity12 's population
since 1984 , the militant @entity27 ( @entity27 ) has fought the @entity12 government
