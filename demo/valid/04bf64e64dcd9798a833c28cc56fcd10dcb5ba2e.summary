@entity1 , @entity2 at @entity5 's @entity4 , hundreds of migrant workers line up daily at the immigration counters , clutching newly printed passports and boarding passes			1
many of them , though , are clueless as to where they 're headed			2
as a frequent traveler to the country , i 've been approached many times by these men , asking me to help fill out their departure forms			2
usually , when i ask what country they 're traveling to , i get the same answer : " i 'm not sure			2
" they seem weary and lost but still hopeful that they can make their lives better			2
this time , however , i 'm at the airport to follow up on the repatriation of the most unfortunate of these migrant workers -- far too many of them make the return journey in caskets			1
almost every day , the remains of three or four workers arrive back in @entity2 from the @entity31 , according to @entity32 , the secretary of the @entity2 @entity33 and @entity34			1
every other day , at least one dead body arrives from @entity36 , he said			1
" @entity2 migrant workers have the lowest per capita income in @entity36 , " says @entity37 , who served as ambassador to @entity36 from 2007 to 2012			1
" they get exploited the most out of all the migrant workers			1
" he cites lack of education and technical skills as the main causes			2
we are waiting for the body of @entity49 , who left @entity2 for @entity36 only eight months ago			1
the 38 - year old was his family 's breadwinner and the father of five children			1
his younger brother , @entity55 , is at the airport to receive the body			1
he also works in @entity36 and is in @entity2 on leave			1
i ask him why he 's alone			2
" we do n't have money to bring other family members to receive the body , " he says			1
" but they have been calling me every other minute asking for the update			2
" i 'm at the administration filling out the paperwork			2
" he tells the caller on his phone			2
" no , he is n't getting any compensation			2
" with more than 350,000 migrant workers , @entity72 make up the second - biggest community in @entity36 , after @entity75 , the embassy in @entity36 claims			1
when contacted about the deaths of foreign workers in @entity36 , a spokesman for the labor ministry said that all workers deserve to be protected against exploitation			1
@entity82 estimated that some 400 @entity75 and @entity2 workers die each year in @entity36			1
" it is desperately unfortunate that any worker should die overseas , in a foreign land , away from their family , " the spokesman said			1
" but it would be wrong , we believe , to allow the statistics to be consistently distorted to suggest that all deaths in a population of 1.5 million people are apparently the result of workplace conditions , either directly or indirectly , which is the prevailing and erroneous narrative			2
" @entity82 spoke about recent changes in his country , including the introduction of a wage protection system , improved living conditions and increased penalties for companies that violate rules			2
" while the vast majority of workers in @entity36 are fairly treated , we recognise that a minority are not			1
that is why we are reforming labour laws and practices , " he said in a statement			0
as we wait at the airport , a @entity114 plane lands			0
at 7:40 pm , it is the last of three that depart and arrive every day			0
before @entity36 won the right to stage the @entity120 in 2022 and embarked on a hugely ambitious , holistic construction plan to support it , it was a single flight a day			1
hundreds of passengers disembark from the plane			0
" they are mostly migrant workers returning home , " an airport official tells us			1
we spot a cargo worker transporting a bright red box carrying the body of @entity49			1
even in a country where even a fight between two stray dogs can gather a sizable crowd , coffin arrivals do n't seem to attract many spectators			0
the scene has become all too common			0
the coffin is loaded on to a jeep provided for free by the @entity2 government			1
we follow it on the journey to the family 's village in @entity146 district , a seven - hour drive from @entity5			2
" normally , vehicles are not allowed to drive on this highway after 8 p.m. because of the dangerous condition of some of the roads at night , but since i 'm carrying a coffin , the police let me go , " the driver of the jeep tells us			0
the @entity2 government has eight vehicles designated to deliver coffins			1
" they call me the coffin guy , " the driver says with a dark smirk			0
at around 1 a.m. , we stop at a roadside shack			0
all of us eat except for @entity49 ' brother			1
for religious purposes , i need to remain pure			0
so , i ca n't eat anything , " he says			0
i see him buying alcohol shortly after			0
" i 'm too stressed because of my brother 's death			0
i need to comfort myself			0
" back in @entity36 , where alcohol is banned , he and his friends manage to fulfill their needs courtesy of the local black market , he tells us			1
" it ( the alcohol ) is of very poor quality , but that is our only option , " he adds			0
even before we arrive at the village just at the break of dawn , we hear the howling			0
dozens of villagers have already gathered at @entity49 ' home			1
his father cries out in agony , " hey lord , what have you done ? " then he faints			0
all the family members shout at the coffin			2
the wailing and shouting is almost deafening			0
and it goes on for hours			0
as a journalist working in @entity201 , i have seen a lot of desperation and misery			0
but the screeching was so intense ; it 's something i will never forget			0
" he alone was taking care of his parents and his family			2
how will they survive now ? " a villager asks			0
most of the spectators are women			0
most of the men from the village have gone to the @entity31 to work			0
the few who are left behind start preparing for his cremation			0
@entity37 , the former ambassador , says 55 % of @entity2 migrant workers deaths in @entity36 are from " sudden " cardiac arrest , 20 % die from work - related accidents , 15 % from traffic accidents and an alarming 10 % commit suicide			1
@entity2 government records show more than 290 workers have died in the @entity227 state in the past 420 days			1
put another way , two @entity2 workers die in @entity36 every three days			1
these are young men dying in the prime of their life			0
" the cause of deaths needs to be investigated properly , and urgently , " @entity37 says			0
" in general , it is due to tension led by exploitation , adverse climate , poor working and living conditions and alcoholic intoxication			0
" in @entity49 ' village , almost all the men we meet have spent time working in the @entity31			1
many had recently returned from @entity36			1
they tell stories of hardship and of the deaths of their co-workers			0
time and again , none of them seems to be convinced with investigations into their friends ' and compatriots ' deaths			0
and again , amongst the keening and wailing of his distraught family , no one is sure how @entity49 , brought back home in a red coffin along hazardous roads , met his end in @entity36 .			1

a spokesman for the @entity36 labor ministry *details* recent changes to the law
each week , the bodies of dozens of migrant workers are repatriated to @entity2
the body of one man , @entity49 , is returned home as his family mourns
