one of the most pernicious phrases in the debate over how to counter extremist use of social media is " whack - a - mole			1
" in national security circles , many believe that suspending social media accounts used by violent extremists is a pointless endeavor			1
they argue that , as in the children 's arcade game " @entity16 , " suspending accounts is a fruitless endeavor because , they claim , new accounts are created for every account that is suspended			1
to examine this assumption , technologist @entity18 and i collected data on millions of @entity23 accounts , including tens of thousands used by @entity25 supporters , and found substantial evidence to the contrary			1
in september 2014 , @entity23 began to crack down on @entity25 supporters who used its platform , suspending tens of thousands of accounts over the course of several months			1
while many users did create new accounts during the first month of the crackdown , the number of new accounts plunged after september , even though suspensions increased			2
@entity23 has indicated that its suspensions fell at least at the high end of our estimated figure , possibly even higher still			2
the result is that suspensions are outpacing the number of new accounts successfully created , possibly by a wide margin			2
the size of @entity25 's support network on @entity23 is shrinking as a result			1
additionally , we found that the suspensions targeted some of the most active and effective users in the network , the professional activists who empowered @entity25 to broadcast its propaganda to unsuspecting audiences by spamming hashtags such as # @entity54 and # @entity55			1
not only has @entity25 suffered a blow to its ability to spam others , its supporters on @entity23 are so weakened that they are now hoist by their own petard			1
the hashtag that @entity25 uses to promote its own messages has been taken over by opposing spammers , trolls and activists , who frequently tweet five times as much @entity69 content as @entity25 can muster on any given day			2
@entity25 content continues to be available online , of course			2
the number of suspensions is not sufficient to completely deny them the use of @entity23			2
but their audience is shrinking and their ability to game @entity23 with manipulative tactics such as auto - tweeting " bots " has been significantly diminished			1
an estimated 10 % of tweets sent by @entity25 supporters are directed at rebuilding their social networks rather than disseminating propaganda , and that does n't account for the additional impact of time lost to the process of creating new accounts and waiting for followers to find them			1
these are worthy goals , and they detract from @entity25 's ability to accomplish its online strategy of intimidation , provocation and recruitment , which is discussed at more length in my new book with @entity105 , @entity25 : the @entity106			1
@entity25 users call the suspensions " devastating " and their fury provides evidence that suspensions hit them where it hurts			0
but that does n't mean suspensions are ineffective , any more than a cold day outside invalidates decades of temperature trends that show the impact of climate change			0
the view outside your window , especially if you are an analyst or journalist following a couple hundred terrorist accounts , will not always accurately reflect an online climate where tens of thousands of accounts are in play			0
while our study was only a preliminary look at this issue , it examined a body of data that dwarfs any existing study on the subject			0
while future research will help clarify the impact of suspensions over time , it is not likely to ever fully settle the complaints of the whack - a - mole crowd , who are as persistent as their favorite metaphor			0
nevertheless , it 's time to move the serious debate away from the question of whether suspensions are effective and toward more complex issues with a better grounding in the available data			0
there are complications that arise from the suspension process			0
one of the most notable we observed in our study was the question of how people in the network behave under pressure			0
our analysis suggested that the social network of @entity25 supporters on @entity23 is becoming more insular , with users following each other more and becoming less and less exposed to outside influences			1
while it is harder to enter the network in the first place and to stay there as an active user , it is possible that this echo - chamber effect might lead new users to radicalize more swiftly and more intensely			0
tampering with an online social network , through suspensions or other means , is a form of social engineering , and we need to better understand what that means for users			0
we would be better served by research into such new questions than by continuing a tired debate about whether suspensions are effective at degrading the size and online distribution networks of extremist groups			0
it 's time to take this debate to the next level , and let the whack - a - mole mole stay whacked .			0
