three teen @entity2 girls suspected of traveling to @entity3 to join @entity4 appeared on surveillance video in @entity6 before they went to their destination			1
images show the teens boarding a bus in @entity13 , @entity6 @entity9 television reported			2
it 's the first sighting of the girls since they left @entity16 almost two weeks ago			0
authorities have said they have no reason to believe the girls are still in @entity6 and believe they have crossed into neighboring @entity3 , parts of which have been taken over by @entity22 terror group @entity4			1
the three east @entity16 classmates -- @entity24 , 15 ; @entity25 , 16 ; and @entity26 , 15 -- boarded a @entity28 plane from @entity16 's @entity29 to @entity13 on february 17			0
a @entity2 counterterrorism officer said police had tried to reach out to the girls using the @entity6 media and social media to persuade them to return home			1
the girls ' parents have also publicly begged for them to come home			1
days before they left for @entity6 , at least one of the girls allegedly contacted a young woman , @entity40 , who left her home in @entity42 to travel to @entity3 in 2013 and is accused of trying to recruit others via social media			1
an attorney for the @entity47 family said the family was " surprised , horrified " that the contact had not prompted police action " because they understood that @entity53 's social media content was being closely monitored by the security services			0
" " and the real concern that arises is that if a known member of @entity4 who 's now a poster girl for @entity4 , seen to be recruiting and spreading propaganda , is in touch with young people in our country -- that one would expect the courtesy of a knock on the door of these families , to advise them that their children may be on the cusp of radicalization or going off to @entity3 , " @entity56 said			2
the @entity47 family condemned their daughter 's actions , describing them " as a perverted and evil distortion " of @entity75			0
but they also said the @entity2 security services " have serious questions to answer " over their failure to intervene after one or more of the missing girls got in touch with her			0
@entity6 has become the most traveled route for volunteers trying to join @entity3 's many armed factions since an anti-government uprising erupted more than three years ago			2
initially , @entity88 maintained an " open door policy , " allowing hundreds of thousands of @entity3 refugees to flee to safety in @entity6			2
@entity6 border guards looked the other way , taking few steps to stop activists , volunteers and journalists from crossing into @entity3			2
but with the rise of the ultra-violent @entity22 group @entity4 in @entity3 , the @entity6 government increasingly came under criticism at home and abroad for not doing enough to stop jihadists from going through @entity6 to get into @entity3			1
some critics have accused @entity88 of actively supporting @entity4 against rival @entity106 rebel groups , charges the @entity6 government has angrily denied			0
last year , the @entity6 government showed @entity0 new barricades , thermal cameras and fences aimed at better fortifying the border			0
historically , the @entity6 - @entity3 border , which runs more than 800 kilometers ( 500 miles ) , has been notoriously difficult for @entity6 security forces to control			1
before the @entity3 civil war , both smugglers and @entity106 separatist guerrillas were known to operate illegally between the two countries			1
@entity6 government officials have bristled in response to accusations that they are not stemming the flow of foreign fighters joining @entity4			0
millions of tourists visit @entity6 every year , where visas can be obtained upon arrival for citizens of many countries .			0

the teens are believed to have made it to war - torn @entity3
the girls ' parents publicly begged them to come home
