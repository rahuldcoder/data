former male model @entity0 used to make a living from his good looks			1
but after modeling for 10 years the self - confessed car nut had earned enough money to indulge his passion			0
he started by buying several cars , as well as customizing them for clients across the world , and in 2001 he founded the @entity13			1
today is has nearly 250 automobiles			1
" when i was modeling , the best part of my modeling career was ( that ) i was expressing what my client wanted me to do , " he says			0
" i still express what ( clients ) want me to express , but this time in a three - dimensional form with an engine and an exhaust and some wheels			1
and that is ultimate satisfaction			0
" during his fashion model days , @entity0 owned seven cars and would drive a different one each day of the week			1
what started as a passion gradually demanded more and more of his time , and after a while @entity0 felt that he came to a crossroads			1
" i had to weigh between continuing modeling or stopping modeling to just do cars			2
so i chose the latter , " he says			0
" my friends told me ' you 're absolutely crazy , look at all these beautiful women , look at all this traveling around the world			2
' and i 'm like ' are you out of your mind ? look at that beautiful steel ! ' that 's the best			0
" today , the car - lover 's collection includes gems such as the 1937 @entity51 , and a low - riding customized @entity52 which used to belong to @entity53 -- the so - called " @entity54 "			2
but what gives elo the most satisfaction is something less material : the feeling of freedom			0
" when i drive a car , i feel like i am leaving all my worries behind , and it 's just staying behind whilst i 'm going forward , " he says .			0
