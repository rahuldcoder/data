could it get any cuter than seal pup kisses ? the @entity4 and the @entity6 @entity5 this week shared a photo of a @entity9 seal nuzzling up to what looked to be its mom in @entity12 , @entity13			1
the expression of the mother is priceless			1
the photo was taken in october by @entity4 scientist @entity17			1
link , a statistician , was helping researchers tag newborn seal pups			2
he confirmed friday that the adult seal was the baby 's mom			2
it 's hard to know what she was thinking when her baby nuzzled up to her in this photo , but @entity17 said the animals flare their noses when disturbed , " so this @entity32 was pretty relaxed , " @entity17 told @entity1 friday			2
" i have a great shot a few seconds later where @entity32 yawned hugely			2
she looked utterly content , to me			0
" the agency 's public affairs department had asked scientists for interesting images to post on social media			1
as the @entity41 caption notes , the @entity9 seals of @entity12 have been studied extensively for over 40 years			1
" because of its isolation , this population is undisturbed by human activities			0
the weddell seal population is healthy and stable , and thus gives a good example for studies of animal population dynamics			0
" @entity17 said it was a privilege to see the animals up close			0
" i was awed , " he said			0
" it 's incredible that animals can live and thrive in such harsh conditions			0
it 's hard to describe the remoteness and isolation of the spot -- bitter cold , high winds , no life to be seen except for the seals , an occasional skua or an emperor penguin			1
" after a seal pup is born , @entity17 said its mom spends all her time close to her baby in a very small area , with hardly any interaction with other seals			1
" @entity32 does n't even leave for a swim until the baby is nearly ready to be weaned , and even then does n't get to eat			0
so while baby puts on a couple of hundred pounds , @entity32 loses about twice that much , " he said			0
