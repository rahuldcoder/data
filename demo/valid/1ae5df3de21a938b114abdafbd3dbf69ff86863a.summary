as expected , @entity1 prime minister @entity0 gave a rousing speech to @entity4 , rich in historic imagery and replete with literary references			1
yet a speech filled with powerful words is no substitute for a strategy for actually preventing @entity11 from obtaining a nuclear weapon			1
as national security adviser @entity16 told the @entity18 lobbying group @entity17 on monday , " precisely because this is such a serious issue , we must weigh the different options before us and choose the best one			0
sound bites wo n't stop @entity11 from getting a nuclear weapon			2
" the @entity24 administration , on the other hand , is making a strong and credible case that the deal it is pursuing would block @entity11 's pathways to developing the fissile material necessary for a bomb and extend the time for @entity11 to produce enough weapons - grade uranium to build a bomb from today 's estimated three months to at least a year			1
without a deal , @entity11 would revert to building up its stockpile of nuclear uranium , while the international community would lose the ability to monitor and track @entity11 's activities			1
at the top of the list of questions the prime minister failed to address is how such a scenario in the wake of " no deal " would actually make @entity1 safer ? as @entity47 said : " here 's what 's likely to happen without a deal			0
@entity11 will install and operate advanced centrifuges			2
@entity11 will seek to fuel its ( plutonium ) reactor in @entity54			2
@entity11 will rebuild its uranium stockpile			0
and , we 'll lose the unprecedented inspections and transparency we have today			0
" if no deal that the @entity60 and five other powers actually might strike with the @entity11 would be acceptable to @entity0 , how does he propose to deal with the @entity11 nuclear threat ? he spoke about ratcheting up international sanctions against @entity11 and keeping them in place until @entity11 ceased regional aggression , sponsorship of terrorism and threatens to annihilate @entity1			1
but years of extraordinarily tough sanctions did not persuade the @entity11 to abandon their nuclear program or prevent them moving it forward			2
neither did cyberwarfare or a series of assassinations of @entity11 scientists			0
and if the @entity60 was seen as walking away from a possible agreement , the international sanctions regime would likely crumble , not strengthen			0
@entity11 hard - liners who oppose an agreement would be back in the driver 's seat in @entity82 , while those would want to see @entity11 rejoin the international community would be discredited and sidelined			2
it is doubtful that @entity0 really believes sanctions would end the @entity11 nuclear program			1
that leaves one other option -- military force			0
of course , @entity1 could order a military strike on @entity11 any time it chooses , but @entity1 's ability to inflict significant damage on @entity11 's widely dispersed and heavily defended nuclear facilities is limited			1
when the discussion turns to military action , what is really meant is @entity60 military action			1
it is understandable that a foreign leader speaking in the @entity4 would shy away from openly asking @entity101 to attack another country , especially after the experience of the 2003 invasion of @entity105 , which @entity0 also lobbied for			1
we should recall @entity0 's september 2002 testimony to the @entity108 , six months before the @entity60 assault on @entity110 began , when he said : " it 's not a question of whether @entity105 's regime should be taken out but when should it be taken out ; it 's not a question of whether you 'd like to see a regime change in @entity11 but how to achieve it			1
" @entity0 may have learned from that experience			0
he knows that the @entity60 public is weary of war and has no appetite for another military adventure in the @entity122			2
that 's why he advocates policies that would put the @entity60 on a path to military action without mentioning the words " military action			1
" this @entity1 leader , who faces a tough election back home in two weeks , has mastered the art of policy vagueness			0
he applied the same strategy to the failed negotiations with the @entity136 last year , declaring he was in favor of a two - state solution but never putting forward a detailed proposal for where the border should be drawn -- or on any other substantive issue for that matter			0
his biggest demand once again was rhetorical -- that the @entity136 recognize @entity1 as a jewish state			0
this is an @entity1 leader who believes in the power of words -- especially his words			0
but words are no substitute for a strategy -- and that 's where @entity0 once again failed himself , his country and his audience .			1

@entity158 : @entity0 's powerfully worded speech is no substitute for a strategy to keep @entity11 from getting nuclear weapons
he says without a plan , the only option is to put @entity60 on path to military action
@entity0 also lobbied for @entity105 invasion in 2002 , @entity158 says
