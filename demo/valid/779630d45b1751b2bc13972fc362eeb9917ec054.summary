you may have heard that @entity3 politics is extremely complex			1
but one of the most important forces at play there is actually rather straightforward : when @entity3 feel safe and strong they tend to support moderate parties			2
when they feel vulnerable they move to the right			0
understand that , and you will understand @entity3 -- and why president @entity12 may have inadvertently given @entity13 a helping hand			1
@entity3 know they need @entity16 support to survive in a hostile , increasingly unstable and radicalized neighborhood , but they do n't believe they can trust @entity12 to help keep them safe			2
and the president , despite taking numerous measures to support the jewish state , has done a dismal job of persuading @entity3 that he has their back			2
this reality helps explain how @entity13 and his rightist @entity25 party pulled off an upset victory this week , despite opinion polls showing them trailing the main opposition @entity29 heading into tuesday 's election			1
clearly , it 's not all @entity12 's fault			0
@entity13 's opponents also failed to address security issues , believing a focus on pocketbook matters would be enough			1
and @entity13 is a skilled , articulate and shrewd politician			2
but @entity12 , like it or not , was one of the reasons for @entity25 's success			0
when @entity13 traveled to @entity41 a couple of weeks ago to warn the @entity42 about an impending " bad deal " with @entity44 over its nuclear program , @entity12 refused to meet with him , claiming he did n't want to influence @entity3 's elections			1
few believed this was the real reason -- it 's no secret the two men do n't particularly like one another			0
through much of his presidency , @entity12 has failed to convince @entity3 thay they can trust him			2
and his handling of the recent spat with @entity13 only added to the problem			0
by appearing to dismiss @entity13 's warning of a " nuclear nightmare " over the @entity44 talks by arguing that the prime minister was offering no " viable alternatives , " @entity12 missed an opportunity to reassure security conscious @entity3 that the @entity16 will safeguard their survival			1
his tacit acknowledgment that there might be no alternative to an imperfect deal was of little comfort to @entity3 who have spent years hearing genocidal threats from the @entity44 regime			0
opinion : will @entity13 win seal @entity44 deal ? the fact that @entity12 has become one of the key reasons why @entity13 continues to win elections in @entity3 is ironic considering @entity3 are profoundly worried about the deteriorating ties with the @entity16 , a relationship they consider key to ensuring their country 's survival			1
one recent poll showed only 37 % of @entity3 believe @entity12 has a " positive " position towards @entity3 , a mood that has undoubtedly helped @entity13 enormously , despite the fact that large numbers of former security officials have said @entity13 is endangering the country by undermining ties with @entity41 , and despite @entity3 saying close relations with the @entity16 are the second most important factor for @entity3 's security , behind only @entity3 's own military strength			1
all this left a genuine opening for @entity12 to influence the @entity3 electorate , because @entity3 desperately want to trust the @entity16 president -- and they remain @entity16 's biggest , most loyal fans , according to a recent @entity97 poll			0
5 questions about @entity13 's apparent victory yet despite the positive sentiment in principle , @entity3 voters -- especially on the right -- have been skeptical that @entity12 has their best interests at heart			1
this point was underscored in a recent poll that asked @entity3 recently if they believed president @entity12 would agree to a deal that @entity3 officials considered harmful to @entity3 's security			1
of those that responded , 61 % said yes , he would do so			0
however , 95 % of @entity115 supporters said no , @entity12 would do no such thing , while 93 % of @entity25 voters said they believed @entity12 would disregard @entity3 's security			1
the worry over security extends beyond a nuclear deal with @entity44 to include the other key foreign policy issue -- the possibility of a @entity124 state			0
a majority of @entity3 still support the creation of two states , one for @entity3 and another for @entity124			0
and despite the last - minute statements from @entity13 dismissing the idea , it is important to remember that polls have consistently shown @entity3 continue to support the establishment of a @entity124 state , as long as @entity3 's security can be assured			1
the trouble is that right now , many @entity3 do n't believe they can preserve their security with a @entity124 state just a few miles from their major cities , not least because previous territorial withdrawals -- from @entity140 and from southern @entity141 -- have simply created launch pads for attacks against @entity3			2
so when rightist leaders such as @entity13 say @entity3 will not be safe with a @entity124 state , voters are inclined to believe them			1
all this suggests that if @entity12 wants to persuade the @entity3 public to push its government towards compromise , he needs to rebuild the public 's trust in him			0
@entity3 want peace , but they also need to be reassured that their safety and survival is a paramount concern of their @entity16 ally			0
and if president @entity12 can not assure them of this ? well , they will simply wait until there is a president they feel they can trust			0
it 's not that complicated .			0
