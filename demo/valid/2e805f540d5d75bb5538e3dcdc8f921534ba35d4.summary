" wait up 2015 @entity0 and dr. @entity1 -- you want me to climb up @entity4 -- that is over 1,500 feet straight up			1
are you nuts ? " i screamed			2
this is actually what i signed up for when i uploaded my video to the @entity0 website in december			1
" but climbing mountains on sunday morning -- you got to be kidding me , " i exclaimed			2
but it was all part of the process i realized i was going to take on as i learn how to be a triathlete			2
after our first initial week with a trainer and nutritionist , the six of us were introduced to a whole new way of how to approach fitness and how to incorporate it into our lives			2
i knew it was going to be a difficult task , especially for someone like me heavily involved in civic affairs and community service			2
at @entity28 , our nutritionist walked us through a number of exercises on how we should look at food , nutrition and our calorie intake			0
after being on several diets over my lifetime , what he said was simple			0
to look and review your intake and replace it with other foods such as fruit and vegetables -- these small steps can be major impact on your training			1
tackling nutrition and calorie intake can also be exactly how i viewed the climb up @entity4			0
i put these nutritional issues on the backburner for years			0
it was pretty much like looking at the mountain that i was about to climb that morning -- where do i start , where do i begin ? -- and telling myself that it was going to be an arduous task			0
my training schedule has also been an uphill battle			1
in january and the first weeks of february , i started strong with my gym , running and swim workouts			0
however , as life pressures got in the way , i saw myself withering off			0
but luckily i have been inspired by my 2015 @entity0 teammates to keep me on track			1
their updates have been truly inspiring and have helped me think about the struggles i face in my training activities			1
as i get older , i realize that fitness and nutrition are key to long - term health ; however , the support of friends and family is also important to help tackle your health			0
my team members of the @entity0 have been there for me			1
i recently weighed myself when i visited the doctor 's office			0
it has been six weeks since i hit the scale			0
i actually lost 20 pounds			1
what ! really ! uphill battles are hard to see when you are in the middle of them			1
just like that sunday afternoon in january , i could not wait to be on the mountaintop and see the view from @entity4 with the members of 2015 @entity0			1
and guess what ? after all this huffing and puffing over the last six weeks , i ca n't wait to see the view in september at the @entity91 triathlon			0
it 's just another uphill mountain to climb .			2

@entity94 says training schedule has been an uphill battle
since *joining* @entity0 team , @entity94 has lost 20 pounds
