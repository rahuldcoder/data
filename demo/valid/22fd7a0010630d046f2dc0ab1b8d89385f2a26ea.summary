@entity0 killed 19 people and sent tourists scrambling for cover in a siege at a museum in @entity8 's capital on wednesday			1
the @entity11 nation 's prime minister called it a cowardly terrorist attack and warned that three suspects were still on the loose			1
@entity8 security forces killed two attackers as they ended the hostage siege at the @entity18 in @entity19 , prime minister @entity14 said			1
but the death toll , which included 17 tourists and at least one @entity8 security officer , could climb			1
@entity27 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 tourists were among those killed , @entity14 said , with another 20 foreign tourists and two @entity8 wounded in the attack			1
" it 's a cowardly attack mainly targeting the economy of @entity8 , " the prime minister said			1
" we should unite to defend our country			0
" the scene played out at a popular tourist destination in the heart of @entity8 's capital in a building linked to where the nation 's parliament meets			1
lawmakers there were in the middle of a committee meeting when they heard gunfire erupt			0
" the tourists were frightened and they were running in different directions			2
we opened the doors and we got them to enter to the @entity52 , " lawmaker @entity53 told @entity1 's @entity54			2
an administrator told lawmakers to lay down on the ground as a gunbattle broke out between terrorists and police , said @entity61 , a member of parliament			0
it was n't long before the building was evacuated			0
photos on @entity65 showed security forces in bulletproof vests and black helmets and masks , guns drawn , in the area			0
authorities set up a large security cordon around the targeted museum			2
rescuers carried wounded tourists away on stretchers			0
@entity14 did n't specify where the attackers came from			0
@entity80 spokesman @entity79 called them @entity82 in remarks on national radio			1
the museum , housed in a 19th century palace , bills itself as " a jewel of @entity8 heritage			1
" its exhibits showcase @entity8 art , culture and history , and it boasts a collection of mosaics , including one of the poet @entity96 , as well as marble sculptures , furniture , jewels and other items			1
no one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack			1
but it happened just days after a @entity8 jihadist tweeted that a pledge of allegiance to @entity109 leader @entity108 was coming soon , according to the @entity110			1
in his message , the jihadi claimed to belong to @entity113 in @entity8 , a group that in december pledged allegiance to @entity109 , even though that vow did n't seem to have fully registered with the @entity117 extremist group			1
his post comes after an @entity109 fighter in @entity120 , @entity121 , recently appeared in a video questioning why jihadis in @entity8 had not pledged fealty			1
" this raises the possibility that the museum attack could be @entity109 ' debut on the @entity8 stage , timed to precede a pledge of allegiance from @entity8 jihadis for maximum impact , " @entity1 terrorism analyst @entity125 said			1
@entity8 has seen far less militant violence than other nations in the region that were part of the @entity140 uprisings , like neighboring @entity141			1
but it has n't been immune to it			0
the government has been battling a jihadist presence in the @entity144			0
there have been several apparent political assassinations			0
and in february , the country 's @entity80 announced the arrests of about 100 alleged extremists and published a video allegedly showing that the group possessed a formula for making explosives and a photograph of @entity109 leader @entity108			1
up to 3,000 @entity8 are believed to have traveled to @entity155 and @entity121 to fight as jihadists , more than any other country , according to the @entity158 for the @entity159 in @entity160			2
" there are hundreds that have returned from the battlefield , yet we have n't seen this kind of activity in @entity8 yet , " said @entity161 , a former @entity163 @entity162 intelligence officer and @entity1 military analyst			2
" i think it was only a matter of time			0
and today was the day			0
" @entity8 is where the @entity140 took root in december 2010 , when a poor , 26 - year - old man set himself on fire in front of a @entity8 government building after police confiscated his vegetable cart , sparking protests there			2
protests throughout the @entity183 and @entity11 soon followed , with revolutions toppling governments in some countries			0
while violence and instability have continued to shake @entity189 , @entity141 and @entity121 , in many ways , @entity8 has been the exception , with @entity192 going so far as to name it " @entity193 " for 2014			2
" the idealism engendered by the @entity140 has mostly sunk in bloodshed and extremism , with a shining exception : @entity8 , " the magazine wrote			2
" ... its economy is struggling and its polity is fragile ; but @entity8 's pragmatism and moderation have nurtured hope in a wretched region and a troubled world			1
" while it has been more peaceful than other countries , @entity8 has seen its share of violence and political turmoil			2
there was cautious optimism after the october 2011 elections -- the country 's first since its independence in 1956 -- that involved 60 political parties and thousands of independent candidates vying for seats in the country 's new @entity219			0
the next two years saw some crackdowns on media freedom , as well as criticisms of efforts to criminalize blasphemy and inject strict religious discourse in mosques			0
in 2013 , two opposition leaders were assassinated			0
but analysts say wednesday 's attack could have been carried out by people who care more about fomenting terror or establishing a strict @entity82 caliphate -- @entity109 ' aim -- than @entity8 politics			1
the country has also been batting socioeconomic problems such as youth unemployment			0
young people who ca n't get jobs are finding that joining extremist groups like @entity109 and @entity242 is a way out			0
up until now , these recruits have largely done their fighting away from home			0
experts think that by taking the fight to @entity8 , they 'll hurt their cause not just by hurting the tourism - reliant economy , but also by alienating most of their countrymen			2
" they 're already isolated and marginalized , and they further isolate and marginalize themselves by these actions , " said @entity253 , a former undercover counterterrorism operative			0
" ... this will just further isolate and alienate these groups from the rest of the public			0
" travelers warned of risks as @entity8 reels from attack @entity1 's @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 , @entity270 , as well as journalists @entity271 , @entity273 and @entity274 , contributed to this report .			1
