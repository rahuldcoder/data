it was nothing if not predictable			0
take combustible issues like religion and sexuality , stir in a new law and talk of a boycott , then -- boom ! -- the debate on social media explodes			1
and so it has proved with @entity14 's new " religious freedom " law , signed thursday by gov. @entity15			1
the new law could allow businesses to turn away gay and lesbian customers if serving them would contravene the business owner 's religious beliefs			1
supporters of the bill say it protects their right to believe as they choose			1
opponents say it is nothing but bigotry dressed up as liberty			2
the debate is nothing if not vitriolic			0
" @entity36 , " reads one tweet , which goes on to assert that @entity14 's " @entity35 ( sic ) " is modeled on federal legislation signed by president @entity34 in 1993			1
people on the other side of the debate are equally emphatic -- and , it seems for the moment , more numerous			0
some have likened the new law to permitting businesses to discriminate against black people , if perchance their religion dictated that			0
others say that @entity14 seems out of step with modern times			2
and then there is the business reaction -- both the nascent boycott from outside the state and the rush by some businesses inside the state to declare that , law or no law , they have no intention of turning anyone away			2
" my team just canceled travel to in due to the # @entity69 , " tweeted a user under the name @entity65 , who says he works for @ salesforce			0
" we stand against discrimination			0
" and a tweet from a the @entity73 , a business in @entity75 , the state 's capital and its largest city , pledged in capital letters to continue serving all			1
the word @entity80 should only be used when it 's inclusive and fair for all			0
supporters of the law , however , made it clear what they thought opponents should do with their proposed boycott			1
" before you go and get too self - righteous w / your # @entity92 , " a user called @entity94 tweeted , " @ @entity95 is protecting # religiousfreedom for everyone ! # @entity98			0

social media supporters of @entity14 's " religious freedom " bill say it protects their right to hold their own beliefs .
opponents of the bill say its " freedom " is a cover for bigotry against gays and lesbians .
some @entity14 businesses tweet that they will continue to serve all customers , regardless of *orientation* .
some users take to social media in attempt to *organize* boycott of @entity14
