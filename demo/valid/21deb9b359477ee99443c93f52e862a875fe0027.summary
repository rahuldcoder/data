there are many things that immigrants could teach those of us who are @entity6 - born			1
the biggest lesson may simply to be grateful for our rights and privileges			2
that includes the little things we take for granted			2
like a small plastic card that not only allows us to drive on public roadways but also provides us a sense of identity			1
imagine not having a driver 's license and not being able to obtain one because the government prohibits it			1
@entity20 does n't have to imagine			2
until recently , the 27 - year - old @entity22 resident and co-director of the @entity24 was barred from having a driver 's license by @entity27			1
the reason : she is an undocumented immigrant born in @entity30 and brought here as a child by her mother			2
given that she arrived in the @entity6 when she was 11 and has lived on this side of the @entity6 - @entity30 border longer than she lived on the other side , @entity20 considers herself an @entity6 and this country her home			2
under @entity39 , which was initiated by the @entity41 administration , more than half a million undocumented youth were given a two - year reprieve from deportation and a work permit			2
@entity20 is one of the recipients , having been granted @entity39 protection in november 2012 and a renewal since then			2
from that point , had she lived in another state , the process for getting a driver 's license might have been much smoother			1
but she lives in @entity27 , which -- in the 20 years from 1989 to 2009 -- welcomed illegal immigrants and their labor to build homes in @entity22 , work in restaurants in @entity57 and make beds at ski lodges in @entity60 but then tried to expel them when their chores were done			1
to push them out the door , legislators passed a spiteful law in 2010 that roped local police into enforcing federal immigration statutes and essentially sanctioned ethnic profiling of @entity69			0
in august 2012 , on the same day that @entity39 took effect , @entity27 gov. @entity70 issued an executive order preventing the program 's recipients from obtaining driver 's licenses or other public " benefit			1
" @entity70 's order was challenged in court			1
two years later , in july 2014 , a three - judge panel of the 9th @entity81 struck down the @entity27 policy as a violation of the equal protection clause of the @entity6 @entity85			1
with that , the estimated 22,000 @entity39 recipients who are also residents of the @entity27 were free to apply for driver 's licenses and take their driving tests like anyone else			1
@entity20 got her @entity27 license earlier this month , after paying a $ 25 fee that she 'll have to pay every two years each time she renews it			1
i wondered what traveling that road taught her about that piece of plastic she carries with her			0
and i was curious about whether she had given any thought to how the native - born see driver 's licenses compared to people like her			1
" there is a pretty big difference , " @entity20 said			0
" i think it 's because we fought really hard for it			1
people born here might not ever think about their driver 's license unless they buy a drink or get stopped by police			1
for us , it 's a reminder of the fruits of our labor			1
think about how many minds we had to change so people could come out of the shadows			0
" other privileges get taken for granted by the native - born , she said , such as the ability to apply for financial aid to attend college or pay the lower in - state tuition that you 're entitled to pay as a state resident			0
" when it comes to higher education , i do n't think a lot of people really understand what they have unless they have to struggle to get it , " @entity20 said			0
" i have nephews who are citizens			0
i 'm trying to make them understand how it was such a big deal , in my case , to attend college and pay in - state tuition and have it taken away			0
it was a big hurdle , and i almost dropped out			0
i want them to understand some of the privileges they have			0
" finally , there 's the right to vote			1
undocumented immigrants ca n't do it , and yet many of those @entity6 citizens who can do n't bother going to the polls			2
" look at what we 've done to bring change , " she said			0
" imagine how much someone can accomplish when they vote			0
a lot of @entity6 do n't learn the political process			0
and you do n't feel you need to until you struggle to drive , to vote , to just be allowed to stay with your family			0
" listen to her , @entity6			0
this is an exemplary country , and it 'll stay that way as long as those of us who were born here and have these rights and privileges learn to appreciate them , treat them with care and put them to good use .			0

@entity175 : a driver 's license is not only about transportation but about identity
