the @entity0 and @entity1 have pulled their last forces out of strife - torn @entity4 , raising fears that the failed state will become even more of a breeding ground for terror groups plaguing the @entity10 and the @entity11			1
over the weekend , the @entity0 evacuated the last of its special operations forces -- including @entity14 and @entity17 @entity16 troops -- amid the deteriorating security situation in the country , the @entity12 said			1
on monday , a security source in the region familiar with the situation in @entity4 told @entity2 's @entity23 that @entity25 special forces had also left @entity4 in the last few days			1
the @entity25 @entity26 declined to comment			1
the @entity0 move came a day after terrorists bombed two mosques in the capital , @entity31 , on friday , killing at least 137 and wounding 357 others , according to @entity4 's state - run @entity33			1
the terror group @entity34 , based in @entity35 , claimed responsibility for the attack			0
it also followed months of fighting between government forces and @entity42 rebels , who on sunday seized the international airport in @entity45			0
the rebels now control both the airport and @entity31			0
@entity4 has been a key @entity0 ally in the fight against @entity49 , allowing @entity0 drones and special operations forces to stalk terrorists in the country			1
now , that arrangement is in tatters , along with any semblance of peace in the @entity10 nation			0
while @entity12 spokesman @entity60 said saturday that the @entity0 would continue to " take action to disrupt continuing , imminent threats to the @entity0 and our citizens , " the move left some wondering what role the @entity0 could play with no forces on the ground			1
the country closed its embassy in @entity31 last month			0
" i do n't think there is an active role for the @entity0 other than intelligence and trying to see where the dust is going to settle , " said @entity0 sen. @entity70 , a @entity71 who serves on the @entity73 and intelligence committees			1
that raises the possibility of the already unstable country becoming an even more fertile environment for terror groups to collaborate , grow and export violence , according to @entity85 , a security and defense analyst with the @entity87			1
" it 's becoming much like @entity35 , much like @entity90 was at the peak of its instability , " she said			0
on sunday , @entity95 officials said the country appeared to be on a " rapid downward spiral			1
" the @entity97 again deplored the violence and called for an end to the fighting and for @entity42 rebels to return government facilities to the elected government of president @entity104			0
but officials said recent events " seemed to be leading the country further away from a peaceful settlement and towards the edge of civil war			2
" in addition to counterterrorism issues , all sorts of geopolitical influences are at work in @entity4 -- chief among them the regional power play between regional rivals @entity118 and @entity119			1
the @entity42 rebels are @entity120 with ties to @entity118 , who have long felt marginalized in majority @entity4			2
@entity126 @entity125 countries in the @entity127 want to limit the influence of @entity118 , particularly @entity119 , said @entity2 military analyst lt. col. @entity129			1
" they believe now that @entity118 is in control in @entity132 , in @entity133 , in @entity134 and now on their southern border in @entity4 , " @entity129 said			2
" so the @entity119 are beginning to feel a little threatened here and are hoping the @entity4 situation does n't spiral out of control			1
" the @entity119 and other @entity141 @entity125 nations have called for every effort to be made to roll back the @entity42 gains and hand full control back to @entity104 's government			2
on monday , @entity42 leader @entity146 criticized regional governments over their stance on the fighting			0
@entity150 said his group was striking back at @entity49 and @entity34 in self defense , and said he found it " very strange " that nearby governments would condemn the group for such acts while welcoming the @entity0 , which he called " the umbrella of tyranny in the world			2
" @entity4 : what you need to know about how we got here there 's little reason to believe the @entity97 's calls for peace will have much impact			2
last month the council slammed the rebels for taking over democratic institutions and holding officials under house arrest , with little effect on the fighting			0
last week , a @entity178 jet commanded by the @entity42 fired missiles at a palace housing @entity104 in the port city of @entity182			0
no one was injured , but the direct strike marked an escalation in the deadly fighting between the two sides			0
that same day , @entity178 military forces -- some under the @entity42 , others led by officers loyal to @entity104 -- battled in @entity182 , leaving at least 13 people dead in the clashes , @entity182 gov. @entity188 said			2
the fighting is taking a huge toll on @entity4 's people and economy , said @entity198 , the country 's former youth minister			1
aside from the direct impact of fighting , people are losing jobs and businesses are closing , he said			0
there 's still time , he said , to implement a political solution to the crisis			0
" i do n't think we 're past the point of no return yet , " he said			0
" i do n't see anything stopping a major war going on , " he said			0
@entity2 's @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 and @entity216 contributed to this report .			2

" @entity119 are beginning to feel a little threatened here , " @entity2 military analyst says
country is in a " rapid downward spiral , " @entity95 officials warn
with @entity0 and @entity25 forces gone , fears rise that terror could blossom in @entity4
