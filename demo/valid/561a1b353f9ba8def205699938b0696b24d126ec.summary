@entity0 went familial for fall at its fashion show in @entity5 on sunday , dedicating its collection to " mamma " with nary a pair of " mom jeans " in sight			1
@entity0 and @entity0 , who are behind the @entity13 brand , sent models down the runway in decidedly feminine dresses and skirts adorned with roses , lace and even embroidered doodles by the designers ' own nieces and nephews			0
many of the looks featured saccharine needlework phrases like " i love you , mamma " and " @entity32 " ( for the most beautiful mother in the world ) as a tableau vivant of moms and daughters stood and posed as a backdrop for the runway			0
even the usually stoic - faced front row could n't help but applaud and smile as a few models carried their own high - fashion progeny down the runway .			2
