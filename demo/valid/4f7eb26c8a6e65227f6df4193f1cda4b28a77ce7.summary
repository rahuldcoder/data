@entity7 , @entity3 's attorney , confirmed that investigators were searching the home			1
it was not immediately clear what they were looking for inside @entity3 's 14th - floor condo , where he has lived for many years , @entity1 affiliate @entity10 reported			1
the raid comes days after @entity16 agents arrested @entity3 in a @entity18 hotel			1
the @entity19 filed a first - degree murder charge against him on monday , accusing @entity3 of shooting and killing his close friend @entity22 in december 2000			1
if convicted , he could face the death penalty			0
" i think it 's ridiculous for them to be making a search 15 years after @entity22 was killed , and they 're searching a place in @entity4 , " @entity7 told @entity1			2
@entity3 remains jailed in @entity18 , where he 's facing drug and weapons charges stemming from his arrest over the weekend			1
@entity3 's alleged connections with @entity22 's death and two others were the focus of @entity37 's true crime documentary , " @entity38			1
" @entity7 has claimed it 's no coincidence authorities moved in to arrest @entity3 just as the documentary 's finale was about to air			2
and on tuesday , he said he was n't surprised about the @entity4 raid either			0
" i 'm not surprised they 're acting like a bunch of keystone cops , particularly after being embarrassed by the tv program , " he said			0
" and i 'll be even more surprised if they find anything of any evidentiary value whatsoever			0
" prosecutors accuse @entity3 of " lying in wait " and killing @entity22 , a crime writer and his longtime confidante , because she was a witness to a crime			2
she was shot in the head shortly before investigators were coming to speak with her about the disappearance of @entity3 's first wife in 1982			1
@entity3 has long maintained he had nothing to do with @entity22 's death or his wife 's disappearance , though some have questioned whether comments he made at the end of the documentary -- muttering under his breath in the bathroom that he " killed them all " -- could be interpreted as a confession			2
@entity7 told reporters monday that his client did n't kill @entity22			0
" he 's ready to end all the rumor and speculation and have a trial , " @entity7 said			0
but it 's unclear when a trial could take place			0
