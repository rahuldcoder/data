@entity0 's @entity19 newspaper carried a story monday that its reporters had been barred entry to the restaurant , being told by a guard at the entrance that " the time for @entity9 is over " when the journalists arrived at 7 p.m. only locals accompanied by @entity3 , @entity31 or @entity32 patrons would be admitted , the newspaper reported			1
it also reported that two local politicians , " loyal patrons " @entity4 senator @entity35 and former cabinet minister @entity36 , had been admitted , the latter being a friend of the owner			0
@entity0 social media users were quickly up in arms about the ban , taking to @entity43 and @entity44 to voice their displeasure , using the hashtag # noblacksallowed			1
the establishment , known only as @entity48 , in the @entity50 neighborhood of @entity4 , has subsequently been closed after it transpired that it lacked several necessary licenses , said reports			0
the @entity19 reported that the @entity3 - owned eatery lacked liquor , health or change - of - use licences -- the latter needed as the property had been converted from a residence to a restaurant			1
