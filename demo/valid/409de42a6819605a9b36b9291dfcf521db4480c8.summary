@entity3 , @entity4 the @entity2 military has pulled its remaining personnel out of @entity4 due to the deteriorating security situation , the @entity0 said			1
the evacuation involved about 100 special operations forces members from the @entity14 airbase , sources in the region familiar with the situation told @entity5			1
the @entity0 called it a temporary relocation			0
those evacuated , which include @entity19 and members of the @entity22 's @entity21 , were the last @entity2 forces stationed in the @entity25 nation , which is home to @entity27 , the terrorist group also known as @entity27			1
" we ... continue to actively monitor terrorist threats emanating from @entity4 and have capabilities postured in the area to address them , " @entity0 spokesman @entity28 said late saturday			1
" as we have in the past , we will take action to disrupt continuing , imminent threats to the @entity2 and our citizens			1
" the @entity2 closed its embassy in @entity3 last month , after @entity39 rebels took over the @entity4 capital			1
and hundreds of @entity27 members escaped two @entity4 prisons thursday and friday , raising further security questions			1
" there is no military solution to @entity4 's current crisis , " @entity28 said			1
" we urge the immediate cessation of all unilateral and offensive military actions			2
" the @entity49 is taking the situation seriously			0
the @entity53 will meet at 3 p.m. et sunday to discuss @entity4 , the @entity52 mission said saturday via @entity54			1
for years , the @entity2 military has worked closely with @entity4 's government to go after @entity27 , together carrying out numerous attacks like the 2011 drone strike that killed prominent @entity27 figure @entity59			1
and @entity2 president @entity60 has hailed this cooperation as a pillar in his anti-terrorism campaign			1
" @entity4 has never been a perfect democracy or a island of stability , " @entity60 said in january , promoting the policy of " partnering and intelligence - sharing with that local government " as the best approach in a bad situation			1
" the alternative would be for us to play whack - a - mole every time there is a terrorist actor inside of any given country , " the president said			0
but while there have been drone strikes as recently as last month , these cooperative efforts have been hampered by @entity4 's growing difficulty in maintaining unity and peace			1
these include the rise of the @entity39 , their battles with forces loyal to ousted president @entity89 and the presence of not only @entity27 fighters but other militants			0
on friday , for instance , @entity93 purportedly claimed responsibility for bombings at two mosques in @entity3 what , if true , would mark that group 's first large - scale attack in @entity4			1
the claim came in a statement posted on a site that previously carried @entity93 proclamations , but could n't be immediately authenticated by @entity5			0
those blasts killed at least 137 people and wounded 357 others , according to @entity4 's state - run @entity107			2
while @entity93 and @entity27 are both @entity109 groups that espouse extreme versions of @entity111 and violent opposition to the @entity113 , that does n't mean they will be working together anytime soon			0
in fact , @entity27 strongly rebuked @entity93 in a video released in november , characterizing its leader @entity118 's declaration of an @entity111 caliphate as illegitimate			0
more than anything , the idea of the group calling itself the @entity122 violently flexing its muscles speaks to the chaotic situation there			0
with no one really in control , that means numerous groups -- including those with a history of killing civilians and lashing out at the @entity113 -- have been more room to operate and a better chance potentially to take over			0
meanwhile , the main players for control of @entity4 's government -- those siding with @entity89 , who still claims to be president after being deposed earlier this year , and the @entity39 , a minority group that 's strongest in the northern part of the country -- remain very much at odds			2
just two days ago , a @entity4 jet commanded by the capital 's @entity39 conquerors fired missiles at a palace housing @entity89 in the port city of @entity151			2
no one was injured , but the direct strike nonetheless marked an escalation in the deadly fighting between the two sides			0
the airstrikes came on the same day opposing @entity4 military forces -- some under the @entity39 , others led by officers loyal to @entity89 -- battled in @entity151 , said @entity151 gov. @entity162			1
at least 13 people died and 21 others were injured in those clashes , according to @entity162			0
@entity89 took to the airwaves of @entity167 , a station he recently started , on saturday in his first televised speech since escaping house arrest			0
he called on all political factions to take part in upcoming talks in the @entity175 capital of @entity176 , condemning the @entity151 strike and urging @entity4 troops to refuse orders from @entity39 officials			2
@entity89 tied the @entity39 to @entity181 , which he was said supported the " coup " that led to his departure from @entity151			0
" the @entity181 agenda of the @entity39 will not last , " he said			0
after @entity89 spoke , the @entity39 - run @entity107 news agency responded , saying the @entity186 has decided to mobilize forces and " directed security and military institutions to carry out their duties to confront ( the ) dirty war			2
" " @entity194 announces the decision to call proud sons of the @entity4 people in all regions to unite , collaborate and cooperate with members of the armed and security forces in the face of terrorist forces in all parts of the country , " the report said			1
@entity205 , a top member of the @entity206 , said @entity89 's speech wo n't help @entity4 reach a peaceful resolution and accused him of reneging on a deal last september to transfer power			2
" we blame @entity89 for not implementing this deal that drew the road map that would have solved @entity4 's ongoing crises , " @entity205 said			2
" @entity89 will be held responsible for the country 's failures and that chaos that could follow			0
" journalist @entity218 reported from @entity3 , and @entity5 's @entity220 reported and wrote from @entity221			0
@entity5 's @entity222 , @entity223 and @entity224 contributed to this report .			0
