in the center of @entity2 's eastern @entity1 lies @entity4 , which photographer @entity5 says is the largest small - commodity wholesale market in the world			1
the shopper 's paradise , in the city of @entity9 , covers 46 million square feet and has about 62,000 booths , with 100,000 suppliers exhibiting 400,000 kinds of products			1
the sheer enormity of the place posed challenges for @entity20 - based @entity19 , who visited @entity4 twice last year			1
" i tried to see as much as i could in the days that i was there , and became very quickly exhausted by the constant sensory overload , " he said via email			0
" i spent a total of four days constantly walking around @entity9 and would n't say i got near to seeing all of the stalls			1
" @entity19 's " @entity29 " photo project began in january 2014 , when he established both the style and content of his photos : the sellers in their environments in addition to the monotony of the market itself			1
when @entity5 returned to @entity9 in august , he felt well - prepared to begin shooting			1
during this visit , he also came to better understand the atmosphere and dynamics of the market			2
" the atmosphere of the market was quite unusual in that one gets the sense that it really is home to a community , " he said			0
" the second trip i made to the market was during school summer vacation , and because of this there were children in a huge number of the stores who obviously ( spent ) the day in the market with their parents			0
there were also children running and playing throughout the market , riding scooters along its vast corridors , chasing each other around , etc. it gave the impression that this was more than just a place of business , but a place of life , something that took me by surprise			0
" the photos are like an endless delivery of presents , as each and every shot unwraps an assortment of contents within the identically square - shaped booths of the sellers			2
" shooting @entity9 in a repetitive way , for me , becomes a very interesting way of describing the place , as each store becomes describable only by the items for sale within it , " @entity5 said			1
an estimated 40,000 visitors make their way into @entity4 every day			1
many of them are retail buyers			0
because of the large number of visitors and their diverse backgrounds , buyers and sellers typically communicate utilizing translators that work in the market permanently			1
" there is a broad mix of people in @entity9 , buyers and sellers come from all over the world			1
however just from my own experiences and those of others i spoke to , the fastest growing markets are of @entity108 and @entity109 buyers , " @entity5 said			1
there are thousands of orders placed at @entity4 that are later sold to consumers in many different countries			2
" i learned a great deal during this project , " @entity5 said			2
" if there was one thing that particularly stands out , it was the scale of production in @entity2			2
... everything in @entity9 is a one - of - a - kind sample			2
orders are made in @entity9 , but the factories nearby manufacture the items , so what you 're seeing in the market is actually not for sale			1
this is why the stores are so visually rich , because there is no need for multiple samples , every item is different			0
" what makes @entity19 's photos so striking is how they encompass a mixture of familiar sights with unknown wonder			0
social media follow @ @entity142 on @entity143 to join the conversation about photography			0
" possibly the most interesting aspect of this project was when i occasionally encountered an item that was very familiar to me in such a strange place , " he said			0
" we tend to adopt quite personal emotions to our belongings , and if we see something in our own home every day then it naturally fosters quite an intimate relationship			0
what was interesting was then seeing one of these items halfway across the globe , a constant reminder that we have a connection with places around the world ( that ) we know next to nothing about			0
" many of the items shown in the photographs are very ordinary			0
there are woolen hats , artificial flowers , mannequins and even cooking utensils			0
but there are also mysterious sellers barely visible in their booths			0
just as the city of @entity9 is surrounded by mountains , the sellers at @entity4 are boxed - in by their very own mountains of commodities			1
" for me there ( is ) quite a beautiful metaphor in @entity9 , there is a kind of beauty in the numbness of the expressions in contrast with their colorful surroundings , perhaps highlighting the perils of untapped consumption , " @entity5 said			1
" the inhabitants of these spaces become almost swallowed by the objects that make them their living			0
they are , quite literally , consumed			0
" the " @entity29 " photos are part of a larger series by @entity19 titled " consumed , " and it was completed in collaboration with the @entity203 , a nomadic design studio that works to show how distant landscapes connect to the rest of the world			1
@entity19 's photos ultimately leave viewers to reflect upon the possibility that @entity4 may in fact be the origin of many of the products they currently own			1
" i definitely view the items i see in many shops differently now that i have seen ( @entity9 )			2
i 'll often see a particular item whilst walking around @entity20 and think to myself , ' i 'm sure that came from @entity9 , ' " @entity5 said			1
according to @entity2 's state - run news agency @entity221 , more than 60 % of the world 's @entity219 decorations are made in @entity9 and wholesaled at @entity4			1
the likelihood is relevant well beyond @entity223 , however			0
whether enjoying the beach , purchasing clothing or even playing games at the local fairground , consider if the " @entity229 " label imprinted on those inflatable beach balls , shirt buttons , and cuddly teddy bears perhaps connects all the way to one of the @entity4 booths			2
" i believe that more and more , we are defining our environments not as the spaces themselves , in terms of the buildings or architecture , but rather by the objects and devices that we buy and surround ourselves with			0
... i would like that message to carry through universally , " @entity5 said			2
