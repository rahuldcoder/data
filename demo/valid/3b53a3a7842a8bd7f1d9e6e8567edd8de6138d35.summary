the massive meteorite split in two shortly before smashing into @entity2 , wiping out large numbers of species			0
the devastating event took place on our planet many millions of years ago , but researchers are only now beginning to discover what happened			1
in a remote part of @entity12 , the two pieces of asteroid left what geophysicists say is the largest impact zone ever found on @entity2 , spreading over an area 400 kilometers ( 250 miles ) wide			1
" the two asteroids must each have been over 10 kilometers across -- it would have been curtains for many life species on the planet at the time , " said lead researcher @entity18 of the @entity19			0
the team published its research in the journal @entity29 this month			0
the crater caused by the asteroids vanished long ago			2
but @entity18 said the researchers stumbled across scars from the impacts during drilling for geothermal research			0
traces are buried more than 2 kilometers inside the @entity2 's crust , under an area near the borders of @entity41 , @entity42 and the @entity43			1
" there are two huge deep domes in the crust , formed by the @entity2 's crust rebounding after the huge impacts , and bringing up rock from the mantle below , " @entity18 said			1
the researchers are still trying to figure out just how long ago the shattering event happened			1
the surrounding rocks are 300 million to 600 million years old , according to the team , but they have n't been able to find the sort of evidence left by other meteorite strikes			0
a big meteorite strike that is believed to have led to the extinction of many dinosaur species 66 million years ago launched a plume of ash into the air that now shows up as a layer of sediment in rocks			1
but the researchers say they have n't come across a similar layer in sediments from about 300 million years ago			1
" it 's a mystery -- we ca n't find an extinction event that matches these collisions			0
i have a suspicion the impact could be older than 300 million years , " @entity18 said			2
the discovery of the huge asteroid impacts could lead to new insights about the @entity2 's history			2
" large impacts like these may have had a far more significant role in the @entity2 's evolution than previously thought , " @entity18 said			0
