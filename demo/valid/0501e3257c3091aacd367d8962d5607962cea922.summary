@entity1 she knew something awful had happened			1
it was smoky and all she could hear were muffled screams			1
her foot was turned sideways and her legs would n't work right			1
and her good friend , @entity9 , was just lying there on the ground			1
@entity12 -- she 's @entity14 now -- dragged herself across the pavement			1
she wanted to get closer to @entity9 so they could talk and take comfort from each other in the midst of so much chaos			1
" i got close to her , " she recalled			1
" for some reason , i got close to her head and we put our faces together			1
" @entity9 said that her legs hurt			1
they were the last words she 'd speak			1
the two women held hands until @entity9 's went limp			1
@entity14 was the fifth witness of the first day of the terror trial of accused @entity32 bomber @entity31 , who is accused of detonating pressure cooker bombs with his brother to punish the @entity35 for policies they believe inflict suffering on @entity38			1
three people were killed in the blasts : @entity9 , a 29 - year - old manager for a restaurant chain ; @entity42 , an 8 - year - old boy ; and @entity44 , a 23 - year - old grad student			1
more than 250 others were injured			1
and the first day of the trial -- after opening statements -- revolved around a number of survivors of the attack , who recounted in detail the chaos of that day			1
prosecutors called them to the stand to paint a picture of the havoc and pain the bombings inflicted			1
@entity31 's attorneys chose not to cross-examine any of the survivors			1
@entity14 fought her emotions as she looked at a photograph that showed her and her friend of eight years lying amid a heap of dazed and broken people			1
their two faces , side by side , stand out among the jumble of limbs			1
@entity9 's mouth is open , but she is very pale			1
" i was really scared , " @entity14 testified , " and i remember screaming for someone to help us			1
everybody was screaming , everybody was screaming for help			1
it seemed like a long time before help got to us , but it probably was n't			1
" by the time first responders reached @entity9 , it was too late			1
" they were doing cpr on @entity9 and i started to think she did n't make it , " @entity14 said			1
she grabbed her friend 's cell phone and tucked it in her pocket			2
by the time she arrived at the hospital , shock had set in			2
for a while , that phone led hospital staffers to believe she was @entity9			2
when @entity9 's parents rushed to her bedside and saw she was n't their daughter , they were heartbroken , @entity14 said			2
@entity9 's boyfriend recognized her and called her parents			2
two days later , doctors told her they were taking her leg			2
her body was broken , and it hurt like crazy , she said			2
but not as much as losing her friend			2
@entity9 's death was the first to be described in detail at @entity31 's trial			1
but descriptions of the other two deaths at the marathon and the death of a police officer at the @entity113 will come soon			2
there were runners conquering a 26.2 - mile feat nearby , but @entity118 's attention was elsewhere , playing with rocks and pretending to be a scientist			2
the 5 - year - old thought it was a very cool idea to handle the rocks , his mother , @entity124 , told jurors			2
@entity127 recalled that she thought it lucky that @entity118 was happy playing scientist			2
the next thing she remembers is being hoisted and thrown back			2
other witnesses used similar phrases : blown through the air , deafening explosion , cries for help			2
@entity138 , the manager at @entity139 , a running store near where the bombs went off , said it sounded like a loud cannon , followed by an instant cloud of smoke that covered the windows			2
@entity138 recalled stepping outside to the smell of gunpowder and burning hair			2
the decisions about whom to aid first -- those among the injured needing help before others -- still haunts him , he said			2

he sniffled as a photo of the blown - out storefront was shown in the courtroom			0
he told the jury the plea he heard : " stay with me , stay with me			0
" outside , @entity127 tried to sit up , but could not rise much			0

" at that point i thought that was the day i would die , " she said			1
@entity127 lifted her arms and her bones were sticking out of her flesh			0
somehow , over the cacophony , she heard @entity118 calling for her			0
she was n't imagining it			0
@entity184 , who was also part of @entity127 's group and another of wednesday 's witnesses , remembered the terrified boy looking for his mother			0
@entity32 bombing timeline the day 's testimony was dramatic and emotional , most likely as the prosecutors wanted it			1
anyone who follows the news has seen footage of the bombings and read accounts of what happened			1
the power of the survivors ' testimonies in the courtroom was in the details that made what some would call an unimaginable crime into something very real			1
they shared small memories , like what people said in the immediate aftermath of the attack			0
@entity127 told the jury about how she knew @entity118 was being cared for			0
then she focused on the tourniquet that was being twisted on her leg by aid - givers			0
" we have an amputee , " she saw one of them mouth			0
what they told her aloud was something along the lines of " this is really , really bad , but we will help you			0
" another survivor , @entity229 , testified that after the blasts -- which left her ears ringing " just like leaving a concert " -- she was hurt but did n't know that she was severely injured			1
she limped to a railing , grabbed it , and passed out , she said			0
eyes open again shortly afterward , she found herself on her back , with a group of men applying pressure on her thigh , trying to figure out where she was bleeding			0
" i remember a man putting his forehead to my head and telling me i 'd be all right , " she said			1
@entity245 was a senior in high school			0
after the one man told her she would be ok , another said he could see her eyes going white			0

i knew i was dying , " she testified			0
in court , she was asked if she knew why she was feeling cold			0
the blood was leaving my body			0
i was bleeding out , " she answered			0
it felt like she was sliding into sleep			0
almost peaceful , @entity245 said			0
like she was going to go to sleep and fade away			0
