a new @entity2 report on @entity4 's police and courts could not be more clear : @entity6 is needed			1
the 102 - page report details widespread and systemic discrimination against blacks at the hands of officials -- painting probably the clearest picture yet of what the rule of law looks and feels like in the @entity16 city			2
the report is scathing in its critique , and clear about what needs to happen next , but it does n't address the question : who , if anyone , is responsible for what took place ? are individual officers to blame ? is the police chief ? what about city officials who repeatedly pushed police to increase revenue through ticketing , resulting in disproportionate targeting of african - americans ? writing for @entity0 , criminal defense attorney @entity36 argues in favor of gutting the entire police department , and starting from scratch			1
so far , one person has been fired ; two more are on administrative leave			1
are more heads likely to roll ? " when the attorney general said that the @entity2 has made certain recommendations , those are n't necessarily just recommendations			2
the @entity4 police department and municipal courts will have to reform			1
this is a must - do situation			2
we 're talking about wholesale reform , " said @entity0 legal analyst @entity50			2
" and i would be very surprised that any of the leadership remains			1
" mayor @entity54 said the two employees on leave are awaiting the results of an internal investigation			1
" @entity2 officials informed the city of @entity4 that a review of city emails uncovered explicit racial bias by three individuals who are employed by the city of @entity4 police department			1
let me be clear : this type of behavior will not be tolerated in the @entity4 police department or in any department in the city of @entity4 , " he told reporters wednesday			1
" the three individuals were placed on administrative leave pending an investigation			1
one has since been terminated			2
" a source said the two employees " will not survive the investigation			0
" @entity0 senior legal analyst @entity78 criticized the mayor 's response , seemingly suggesting that more needed to be done in the wake of the @entity2 report			0
" you read this report , and , one officer loses his job ? you know , you translate the bureaucratic gobbledygook of the mayor , that 's all that happened there , " he said			0
surprisingly to some , controversial police chief @entity93 remains at the helm			1
although the report is limited to correcting action going forward , people affected by past abuses do have the option of filing civil lawsuits against specific individuals			0
such cases are not easy to bring , according to @entity104 , a law professor at @entity105 in @entity106			0
" in a court of law , the findings of this report would n't even be admissible , " he said			0
" basically , you 'd have to prove each allegation			0
" @entity113 gave an example of person who paid a $ 100 fine that was unjustly levied			1
finding lawyers who would take an individual case like that would be tough , he said , because there is no guarantee they could recover on behalf of their client , and the amount of damages could very widely			0
practically , that person may be out of luck			1
but if the @entity2 gets its way , illegal or improper behavior on the part of police and courts in @entity4 could soon be a thing of the past			2
" it is time for @entity4 's leaders to take immediate , wholesale and structural corrective action , " said attorney general @entity135			0
" the @entity2 reserves all of its rights and abilities to force compliance and to implement basic change			0
nothing is off the table			0
" @entity0 's @entity146 contributed to this report .			0

so far , one person has been fired ; two more are on administrative leave
controversial police chief @entity93 remains at the helm
