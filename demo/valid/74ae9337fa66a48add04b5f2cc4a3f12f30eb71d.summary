a year - and - a - half ago , when the @entity5 edition of @entity2 and @entity7 's ongoing book series about the deaths of famous people was released , @entity2 did the talk show circuit to promote the book			1
to " @entity12 " @entity2 professed that his " @entity11 " is not a religious book			1
it was purely historical , said the @entity15 host			0
he said it investigates the political circumstances surrounding the most famous death of all time			0
when asked why @entity5 was killed , @entity2 said , " he was upset that the @entity20 were taxing -- and overtaxing , extorting -- the folks			1
" @entity5 was executed , according to @entity2 , not because he claimed to be @entity22 , but because he interrupted the " money flow " of taxes to the @entity25 and the @entity20 temple leaders			1
as a theologian , i must say that @entity2 buried the lead			1
the death of @entity5 , at least historically speaking , was just one more ignominious execution of a peasant @entity20 in a long line of such executions			2
a century before @entity5 ' death , the @entity25 crucified about 6,000 slaves on the roads leading to @entity37 , putting to an end the @entity39			2
like @entity5 , these slaves stood up to the @entity41 and were quickly defeated			2
five things @entity2 flubs in ' killing jesus ' @entity5 ' death was unique because of its theological and religious import			1
at least that 's what his earliest followers decided upon reflection			2
@entity5 was not the messiah that the @entity51 had anticipated			2
in fact , he 'd done just about the opposite of what was expected : preached peace , lived in relative obscurity , and died young			0
@entity5 was most definitely an outsider -- on this @entity2 and i agree			1
he lived in the outer reaches of the empire , a non-citizen with few rights			0
even his @entity64 accent was considered backwoods in the metropolis of @entity67			0
whether it was the @entity41 occupying force or the powerful temple leaders , they must have thought , " @entity5 is not like us			2
" so it 's pleasantly surprising that the tv movie based on @entity2 's book casts a @entity76 actor , @entity75 , as @entity5			1
@entity75 was raised in @entity77			0
he is thick - featured and broad - shouldered			0
and he is robustly hirsute , the very opposite of the wispily - bearded @entity78 from the @entity79 of my youth			0
speaking of @entity78 , he is just one in a long line of blue - eyed jesuses in art and film			0
for a long time , the actors chosen to play @entity5 have looked more like @entity2 and me than like a @entity88			1
@entity75 is a welcome break from that tradition , but some people have voiced displeasure at his casting			0
having a muslim portray the founder of @entity97 , they contend , is an offense			0
" my religion is inclusivity , " @entity75 told me , and he is an effective evangelist of that religion			0
he is unashamed to talk about his connection to @entity22 , his respect for all three @entity106 faiths -- @entity107 , @entity97 , and @entity108 -- and in the " beauty and magnificence of humanity			0
" to play @entity5 , @entity75 said , he simply focused on the divinity that he believes is available to all human beings , a divinity that @entity5 was specially aware of			2
when @entity2 portrays @entity5 as a champion of low taxes and an opponent of big government , he 's not committing a mortal sin			1
he 's doing what so many have done before : seeing in @entity5 what they want to see , and making @entity5 into someone who looks , talks , and thinks like they want him to			1
so maybe the best thing that @entity127 can do during this @entity128 is to watch a @entity76 portray @entity5			1
in that portrayal , we might be reminded that @entity5 himself did n't look like the dominant culture of his day , and he practiced a religion that the @entity25 did not understand or respect			2
we live in an uneasy time between @entity127 and @entity76 , between @entity97 and @entity108			1
and it was n't so different in the first century			0
then , an obscure figure who was little understood preached peace and died a sacrificial death			0
now a @entity76 actor is bringing him to life , and that is no more scandalous than @entity5 ' own life .			1

a tv movie based on @entity2 's book " @entity11 " casts a @entity76 actor as @entity5
maybe best thing @entity127 during this @entity128 should watch @entity76 portray @entity5 , says @entity151
