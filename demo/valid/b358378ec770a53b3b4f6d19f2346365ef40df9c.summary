@entity4 four days after he was gunned down by an unknown assailant in the heart of @entity4 , former @entity1 deputy prime minister and outspoken @entity3 critic @entity2 was laid to rest tuesday in a ceremony attended by hundreds of mourners			1
his coffin was lowered into the ground at the @entity12 before family , friends and dignitaries , after being carried in procession through @entity4			1
mourners laid wreaths , some with ribbons in the colors of the @entity1 flag , reflecting tributes to a man whom supporters called a true @entity1 patriot			2
earlier , a stream of people took part in a somber memorial service at the @entity31 in @entity4			1
some held flowers as they filed past the open casket of the prominent @entity3 critic and paid respects to his mother , @entity37 , and his children @entity39 and @entity41			2
hundreds more lined up in the cold outside			2
@entity44 , a former prime minister under president @entity45 who is now a leading opposition figure and worked closely with @entity2 , was among the mourners to speak at the service			1
he said he believed @entity2 , known for his outspoken views , was killed out of revenge for his politics			1
he also said he thought the killers would be brought to justice , under the next government of @entity1 if not the current one			2
the assassination has spawned a flood of conspiracy theories			2
though politically marginalized in recent years , @entity2 was one of @entity45 's most vocal critics , and many suspect the @entity3 of either direct or indirect involvement			1
@entity45 has vowed to bring those responsible to justice			2
no one has yet been arrested and authorities have put forward a number of theories , including that the murder was an act of " provocation " intended to destabilize @entity1 , that it was connected to the conflict in @entity70 , that @entity72 extremists were involved or that it was linked to @entity2 's international business affairs			1
the @entity74 said in a statement on its website tuesday that " all scenarios " are being considered and that it is taking all necessary steps			1
" eyewitness are being questioned , @entity80 footage is already being analyzed			0
a number of tests were carried out -- among them are ballistic , medical examination and trace evidence , " it said			0
the memorial service was hosted by @entity90 , a @entity1 journalist known for leaving a @entity1 state tv channel in protest at the @entity3 's current policies on @entity70			1
other prominent @entity1 figures at the service included deputy prime minister @entity96 , prime minister @entity98 's spokeswoman @entity97 , and former finance minister @entity99			2
@entity1 economist @entity100 , who served as economy minister between 1994 and 1997 and is now an academic , said : " @entity2 always said everything that others were afraid to say			1
" @entity105 , editor - in - chief of @entity106 , described @entity2 in a speech as an amazing friend and a fearless politician			1
she added , " this murder is impossible to forgive			0
it 's on @entity45 's conscience			0
" foreign dignitaries included @entity115 ambassador to @entity1 @entity116 , who said @entity2 would be remembered as a @entity1 patriot , and former @entity119 prime minister @entity118			1
@entity118 told @entity5 : " it 's clearly a very sad day for @entity1 , it 's a very sad day for @entity2 ' family , and i 'm personally extremely saddened by what has happened			1
" i knew him in the 1990s , i admired him , i admired what he stood for , and i hope now a thorough investigation will determine who is responsible for this outrage			0
" the opposition politician was shot friday night as he walked across a bridge about 100 meters ( 330 feet ) from the @entity3 with his girlfriend , @entity70 model @entity129 , 23			0
@entity129 -- the only known witness to the shooting -- left @entity4 for @entity132 late on monday			1
she had been staying at the apartment of an aide to @entity2 under constant police guard			1
her mother , @entity136 , told @entity5 on monday that her daughter faces constant psychological pressure from @entity4 authorities and fears she will be implicated in his death			1
the @entity74 said @entity129 was not detained while in @entity4 and that she was offered witness protection , which she turned down			1
@entity129 was free to leave at any point but wanted to give her testimony and contribute to the investigation process , " understanding the important of it for the investigation , " the statement said			0
" it is needless to state how important her testimony is			0
" @entity149 , a senior editor for the economist and a senior vice president at the @entity152 , told @entity5 that the manner of @entity2 's death was highly suspicious			1
" the circumstances of his shooting point very much to official involvement , " he said			0
" if it was some random , ragtag extremist militia from eastern @entity70 killing him , i doubt they would 've been able to do it with such precision in the heart of @entity4			1
" @entity149 also said that the recent history of politically motivated killings in @entity1 suggested that the investigation would come to little			0
" one of the signal things that they all have in common is that they are not cleared up			0
we have a lot of bluster at the time of the death , promises of investigation , but either the culprits are never found or the culprits who are found are very unconvincing ones and the people who gave the orders are never identified			0
" meanwhile , he said , the @entity3 continues to pump out propaganda which suggests opposition activists or those critical of @entity1 's involvement in @entity70 are traitors to their country			0
some of @entity2 's supporters accuse the @entity3 , if not of direct involvement , of creating an atmosphere of hatred which fostered the killing			1
not everyone who hoped to attend @entity2 's funeral has been able to do so			1
@entity194 's former foreign minister and @entity197 @entity196 member @entity193 said she was denied entry to @entity1 on monday night on spurious grounds			0
speaking to @entity5 by phone from @entity4 's @entity201 , @entity193 said she was finally told she was refused entry " according to @entity1 's code of law regarding the defense and security of the @entity1 state and the general health of the public			2
" she had intended to represent @entity194 and the @entity209 -- the biggest parliamentary group in the @entity196 -- at the funeral , she said			0
" like many i admired him , i admired his joyfulness and eloquence , " @entity193 said			0
" my wish was not to cause any danger to @entity1			0
i just wanted to go to pay tribute to a political personality , @entity2			2
" the @entity209 said it was the third time a member of the @entity196 had been stopped at the @entity1 border			0
thousands of @entity2 supporters gathered sunday in @entity4 to mourn the death of the 55 - year - old , who was deputy prime minister during president @entity227 's administration in the 1990s			1
the event took place the same day @entity2 was supposed to lead a rally in @entity4 decrying @entity1 's policies on @entity70			1
@entity70 president @entity234 said last weekend that @entity2 was about to reveal information that would be damaging to @entity1 interests , @entity70 's state - run @entity233 news agency reported			2
@entity45 condemned the killing and ordered three law enforcement agencies to investigate the shooting , the @entity3 said			0
the president also wrote to @entity2 's mother , saying he shared her grief , and promised to bring those behind the killing to justice , the @entity3 said			2
police said they are looking for a man with short hair who stands between 5 feet 7 inches and 5 feet 9 inches , @entity1 's official @entity249 news agency reported			0
the shooter was wearing blue jeans and a brown sweater			0
@entity1 's @entity74 is offering a reward of 3 million rubles ( $ 49,000 ) for information leading to the arrest of the killer			0
it said the tipster will be guaranteed anonymity			0
@entity5 's @entity259 and @entity260 reported from @entity4 and @entity261 wrote from @entity262			2
