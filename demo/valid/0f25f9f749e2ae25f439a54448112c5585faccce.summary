@entity3 , @entity4 talks to reach a deal on a framework agreement on @entity9 's nuclear program will be extended an extra day , @entity1 officials said tuesday			1
" ‎ we 've made enough progress in the last days to merit staying until wednesday			0
there are several difficult issues still remaining , " ‎ @entity12 spokeswoman @entity11 said			0
@entity16 press secretary @entity15 said the talks in @entity3 would continue another day as " long as the conversations continue to be productive			2
" diplomats and negotiators worked late as an initial deadline approached , but more time appeared necessary to reach a framework deal			1
how long talks will continue was unclear			0
@entity27 foreign minister @entity26 informed the @entity9 that he will return to @entity28 at dawn wednesday in an apparent effort to force the @entity9 ' hand , @entity25 diplomatic sources told @entity5			1
@entity32 from @entity9 's @entity33 said earlier tuesday there are no " artificial " deadlines and a deal will be reached , when each issue has been resolved			1
diplomats told @entity5 that there has been progress , but gaps remain			1
for @entity9 , that means there 's a light at the end of the tunnel for crippling sanctions			1
for the @entity49 , it means real hope that it 's possible to loosen up on @entity51 while still being confident that it wo n't develop nuclear weapons			1
the international sanctions relief issue has been resolved , according to @entity32			0
" we have had long discussions on this , but there are issues that are related to sanctions that are still under consideration , " @entity32 said			0
he added that is not the only issue that needs to be worked out			0
the thing is , nuclear physics is complicated			0
so are the international dynamics anytime you 're talking about @entity9 and the @entity49 , with mutual distrust and contempt a shared sentiment for years			1
that 's why it 's taken so long to even get to this point , and why what 's happening in @entity3 matters			1
before you can iron out nitty - gritty technical details in a permanent , comprehensive pact -- which carries the more important deadline of june 30 -- you have to agree on what you 're going to talk about			0
what happens if wednesday passes and there 's no framework agreement ? in the short term , it appears , not much			1
@entity9 's power rises , with or without deal the real deadline is n't for three months , after all			1
as for the march 31 date , there 's nothing to stop the parties from continuing to talk -- though an @entity9 official told state - run @entity93 that no one had raised the idea of an extension as of late monday			1
" all emphasize that the chance should not be missed , and they are all doing their best , " @entity32 said			0
so far , there 's been a lot of meetings , with occasional smiles for cameras followed by foreign ministers talking behind closed doors			2
after working through the previous night , representatives from the key players -- most of them foreign ministers -- met all day tuesday to try to resolve differences in what @entity110 foreign minister @entity109 described as " the final stage " of " these marathon - like negotiations			1
" the parties are either on the verge of a milestone agreement or still separated on some crucial points , depending on who you listen to			0
@entity122 foreign minister @entity121 is among the optimists			1
@entity122 has been closer than most to @entity9 even as it 's gone along with sanctions			2
" prospects for this round of talks are not bad , i would even say good , " @entity121 said before heading to @entity4 for the final round of negotiations , according to state - run @entity128 news agency			0
" the chances are high			0
" but in comments monday to @entity5 , a more cautious @entity133 conceded there was " a little more light there today , but there are still some tricky issues			2
" " there still remain some difficult issues , " the top @entity1 diplomat said			0
" we are working very hard to work those through ... with a view to get something done			0
" 21 questions on @entity9 nuclear talks @entity9 has been under intense international pressure and has faced crippling sanctions over its nuclear program for years			1
the sides began moving away from stalemate with @entity9 ' 2013 election of president @entity153 , who has insisted that @entity9 wants a peaceful nuclear energy program but not weapons			1
viewed as a moderate -- especially compared with other powerful figures in @entity9 , including the country 's @entity158 ayatollah @entity157 -- @entity153 campaigned on a platform that he 'd work to help @entity9 's economy by reducing its rifts with the outside world			1
his government has had some success easing those tensions , spearheading interim agreements that have loosened some sanctions			0
but a comprehensive and final deal has remained elusive			0
there 's been discussion on what to do with @entity9 's existing fissile material -- which is important because , as long as it 's still around , that will make it easier to produce a nuclear weapon more quickly			1
still , @entity1 officials suggested monday the debate over this has been overblown , with @entity11 calling it one outstanding issue though " it has n't , quite honestly , been one of the toughest ones			0
" more important are three points that have dominated the talks in @entity3 : how quickly or slowly @entity9 will be allowed to advance its nuclear technology in the last five years of the 15 - year agreement			1
how quickly the crushing @entity189 sanctions will go away			0
whether sanctions will snap back into place if @entity9 violates the deal			2
@entity9 wants them gone for good			2
@entity121 claims that the @entity194 will lift the sanctions right away , but other international negotiators want to merely suspend them , so they can be reapplied as leverage if @entity9 does not keep its end of the bargain			2
agreement on those points is crucial , a @entity25 diplomat said			0
" there can not be an agreement if we do not have answers to these questions , " the diplomat said			0
another point of contention : what to do with the nuclear substances @entity9 already has			2
diplomats had told journalists about a plan for @entity9 to ship its fissile material to @entity122			2
the idea is that if @entity51 does n't have a nuclear stockpile at its fingertips , it will have a longer " breakout time " to make a nuclear weapon should negotiations fall apart			0
@entity9 is n't ready to do that , one of its negotiators said sunday			2
" the export of stocks of enriched uranium is not in our program , " @entity9 deputy foreign minister @entity232 said , " and we do not intend to send them abroad			1
" but on monday , @entity1 officials said the rumblings in the media about the stockpile issue were overblown			0
negotiators had not yet decided any specifics about the disposal of fissile material , and @entity9 has made the comments many times before , a senior @entity12 official said , citing a list of previous examples of such statements in press reports			2
with or without a deal , a lot can change in the next three months			0
for one , the devil is in the details -- any one of which could throw everyone back to square one			0
then there 's the possibility that a deal ironed out in @entity4 is rejected by any of the key players			0
that 's been raised as a possibility in the @entity1 , even though a @entity261 conducted in the past few days found that 59 % of respondents support a deal in @entity9 that would restrict its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions			1
earlier this month , 47 @entity269 senators wrote directly to the @entity9 government , reminding it that any deal it reaches with @entity1 president @entity272 might be moot once his term ends in less than two years			2
one person leading the charge against a possible deal , even though he 'll have no direct part in shaping it , is @entity279 prime minister @entity278			1
reiterating points he made earlier this month to the @entity281 , @entity278 said tuesday " the greatest threat to our security and safety and our future is @entity9 ' attempt to become nuclear			1
" " and the agreement that is being formed in @entity3 , " the @entity279 leader said , " is paving the road to that result			1
" @entity5 's @entity292 reported from @entity3 , and @entity293 and @entity294 reported and wrote from @entity295			1
@entity296 wrote and reported from @entity297			0
@entity5 's @entity298 , @entity299 , @entity300 and @entity301 contributed to this report .			2

sources tell @entity5 that @entity27 foreign minister has told @entity9 he is leaving early wednesday morning
@entity278 : " agreement ... in @entity3 is paving " way for @entity9 nuclear weapons
