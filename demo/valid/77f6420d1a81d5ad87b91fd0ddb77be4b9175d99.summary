the @entity1 only last month started automatically preserving dozens of high - level officials ' emails , according to a department spokeswoman , a revelation that comes amid the controversy surrounding former secretary of state @entity8 's own email use			1
this is key because @entity8 , in her news conference on tuesday to answer questions about why she exclusively used a private email address to communicate during her tenure , told reporters she 'd thought her communications to senior department officials were always saved			1
that 's an important point , given legal requirements for preserving federal records			0
" in meeting the record - keeping obligations , it was my practice to email government officials on their state or dot - gov accounts so that the emails were immediately captured and preserved , " she said			1
the news about the @entity1 's archiving practices -- and the change that started in february -- could refuel the furor of @entity35 over @entity8 's choice to not use her government email account , to have a private server in her family home house her emails , and to decide ( with her staff ) which emails to delete and which to turn over to the @entity1 for review			1
rep. @entity46 , a member of the select committee investigating the 2012 @entity49 attack , said in the @entity35 ' weekly media address saturday , " you see , right now there is no way for us to know whether we have all of the @entity1 communications that rightfully belong to the @entity58 people			1
" " the only way to truly know is by having access to secretary @entity8 's personal server , " the @entity59 @entity35 added			1
" we are asking @entity8 to turn her server over to a neutral , third - party arbiter			0
after a complete inventory , this arbiter can make a determination as to which emails should be public and which should remain private			0
these decisions would be completely impartial and independent			0
" so far , @entity73 ' committee had gotten just under 300 of @entity8 's emails from the @entity1			1
last year , as it was trying to update its records , the @entity1 asked former secretaries of state for nonpersonal emails from their personal accounts that could be work - related			2
that request prompted @entity8 to turn over 30,490 emails -- about 55,000 pages			2
@entity8 has asked for those emails to be made public , and department officials are reviewing them to make sure no sensitive information is released			2
@entity8 's office had said her account contained 62,320 sent and received emails from march 2009 to february 2013			2
" about half were personal that were not in any way related to work			0
i had no reason to save them , " @entity8 said at her press conference			0
the fact that all emails from senior officials were n't automatically saved until recently does n't mean they are gone , according to the @entity1			1
" i would n't state it 's lost to history , because there are always -- there are technical means of gaining access to past information , " spokeswoman @entity101 said friday			0
at the same time , @entity101 said the @entity1 chose to change its approach -- by automatically saving all emails -- " because it 's an imperfect system			1
" " this is a more efficient and better way , " she said of the new system			0
" but , obviously , there were ways to preserve ( emails ) , and employees and individuals were expected to do that prior to this new process			0
" separately , @entity101 said that a letter was recently sent to former @entity1 staffers asking for their help in the preservation effort			0
" if they should become aware ... of federal record in their possession -- such as an email sent or received on a personal email account while ( they were ) serving in their official capacity at the @entity1 -- that ... record ( should ) be made available to the @entity1 , " @entity101 said the ex-staffers were told			2
even before last month 's chance , emails of current secretary of state @entity136 , who uses a government address , were already being saved automatically			1
@entity0 's @entity140 contributed to this report .			0

@entity8 used a private email address while secretary of state
she 's said she thought her communications to officials were always saved
however , a @entity1 official says emails were n't automatically archived until last month
