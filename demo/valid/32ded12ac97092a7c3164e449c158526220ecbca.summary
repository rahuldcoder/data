@entity0 , @entity1 @entity4 sen. @entity3 was delivering his normal rhetoric during a @entity1 speech on sunday , hitting the current administration on the economy , @entity9 and national security			1
" and the @entity15 - @entity14 foreign policy of leading from behind -- the whole world is on fire , " the senator from @entity12 declared			1
but he was stopped by a 3 - year - old girl sitting in the front row			2
" the world is on fire ? " she yelled out			0
@entity3 took it and ran with it			1
" the world is on fire -- yes ! your world is on fire , " he exclaimed , seizing the moment as the crowd burst out into laughter			2
" but you know what ? your mommy 's here and everyone 's here to make sure that the world you grow up in is even better			0
" the scene -- while cute -- captured @entity3 's determination to remain unwavering in his views and language , never backtracking			1
there was no " just kidding " or " that was only a metaphor " to assuage the little girl			2
instead , the first - term senator continued with his speechifying and used the moment to illustrate his point that while things are bad now , they could get better -- especially , cough cough , if he becomes president			0
a woman who identified herself as the child 's mother named @entity59 later told the @entity61 's @entity60 that her child 's reaction came in a " high question kind of voice , " but that her daughter was " quite happy " in the aftermath			0
" she really , basically was like ' oh , oh , this is a great man			0
' he 's the firefighter in her mind as a three - year - old			0
and was quite happy and she wanted a cookie			0
" @entity3 is bringing the resolute disruptor brand that he 's built in @entity74 out on the trail as he lays the groundwork for a @entity78 bid			1
this weekend , he was on a two - day swing through @entity1 , stopping sunday afternoon at an event put on by the @entity81			1
in the same way @entity3 challenges establishment republicans in the @entity84 , he 's trying to build a campaign that breaks from the mold and showcases his firebrand conservatism			1
for example , his first question from the audience came from a woman who wanted to know how @entity3 was going to make campaign finance reform a reality , a huge issue in the first - in - the - nation primary state			1
but @entity3 argued that not only is money a form of speech , it emboldens speech			2
" the answer is not to muzzle citizens ; it 's to empower citizens across the country , " he said			0
throwing a bone to his questioner , however , he said he supports requiring that campaign donations be disclosed			0
he took the same steadfast approach last weekend in @entity109 , when he and other contenders were asked about the ethanol mandate requiring that gasoline contain a certain amount of ethanol -- a popular regulation in @entity109 where corn is king			0
while nearly every other potential candidate expressed at least some measure of support for the mandate , @entity3 flatly opposed it , saying in front of close to a thousand @entity109 farmers that he does n't think the government should be involved in the private sector			1
gov. @entity126 , who 's vying with @entity127 for frontrunner status , said he supported the mandate in @entity109 , despite previously opposing it in his home state of @entity132 asked by reporters sunday about accusations that @entity126 is a flip - flopper , @entity3 first praised his potential rival but made sure to mention that candidates need to be challenged on their actions			2
" it 's easy for candidates to give an answer , " he said , but added : " the proof is in the pudding			0
what i 've urged republicans to ask of every candidate is : have you walked the walk ? show me your record			0
" @entity3 got heavy applause when he said he wanted to " repeal every word of @entity152 , " a set of testing standards that @entity127 staunchly defended when he appeared at a nearby event in @entity156 , @entity1 just two days earlier			1
@entity152 , however , was not legislation approved by @entity74			0
rather , it was created by a bipartisan group of governors and state leaders , and states received financial incentives by the government to adopt the standards			0
still , @entity3 played somewhat coy with his @entity78 aspirations , aware of the tight federal regulations that would start holding contenders to different standards once they admit they 're running for president			1
when voters pressed him sunday to make a @entity78 bid , @entity3 told them to " stay tuned			1
" " i 'm looking at it very , very seriously , " he told the audience			0
" i would point out a week ago i was in @entity109 , yesterday i was in @entity175 , and today i 'm in @entity1			2
" but he truly charmed the crowd when he said that after he and his wife got their daughters a puppy recently , one of the girls gave her approval for @entity3 's presidential aspirations			1
" if you win , that means @entity188 will finally get a backyard to pee in , " his daughter said , according to @entity3			2
in terms of energy and turnout , sunday 's event stood out from other events held by potential @entity78 contenders who were in @entity1 this weekend , in part because it was open to the public , unlike other events headlined by @entity126 and @entity127			1
his remarks were met with boisterous applause , and he was frequently urged to run for president by people who shook his hand before and after the event			0
halfway through @entity3 's remarks , a small - business owner in the audience was called on to ask a question but instead stood up proudly next to the senator and went off into a two - minute rant about how other @entity212 in @entity213 are n't representing their conservative constituents			1
" it is @entity219 in @entity4 folks , " he said , getting the crowd on their feet			1
" we ca n't wait for another @entity212			0
" the man said his wife wrote a blank check for @entity3 and pulled out his wallet , only to throw it on the ground at @entity3 's feet			2
" for those who believe in miracles , this gentleman just threw his wallet at a politician , " @entity3 said , getting a big laugh from the crowd			1
" and he actually got it back			0
" @entity3 could not accept the money because he 's not yet a candidate			2
one man , @entity236 , stood outside in the snow for four hours hoping @entity3 would meet his goat named @entity239 , an apparent fixture on the campaign trail which was wearing a hat that said " i voted " and who happened to bite @entity244 in 2011			1
@entity3 waved hello at @entity236 as the senator exited the building sunday afternoon but did n't stop to greet the goat			1
" he 'll be back again , " @entity236 said , trying to appear unfazed			0
" i 'm sure he wants to get to his next stop			0

@entity4 sen. @entity3 visits @entity1 , hits the @entity78 on economy and @entity9
a little girl in the crowd thinks the rhetorically *speaking* senator is *warning* of a literal global *conflagration*
meanwhile , a goat that once bit @entity244 does n't get the same chance with the @entity12 senator
