i ca n't remember exactly when my teenage fascination with computers collided with the federal government , but i will never forget the morning in 1983 when two @entity6 agents showed up on my parents ' doorstep			1
i had gone to bed around 4 or 5 a.m. after spending hours on my computer , which was pretty common for me back then , at age 18			1
a few hours later , my mom woke me up telling me there were a couple of men here to see me and that they said something about it being official or federal business			1
i had a slight fear this day would come , because only a couple of days earlier , i had a strange call from a friend asking me what i would do if we were visited by the police or some type of investigation team			2
two men sitting at my kitchen table pulled out badges and stated they were with the @entity6			1
they said they needed to talk to me			2
let me start with a little history : i got my first taste of computers in the mid- 1970s in junior high school			2
we had a teletype terminal that had been brought to our school with an acoustic modem attached			2
we were shown how it worked and some of us had a chance to do some math testing			2
i did not get to use it the first time , but i stayed after school that evening to see if i could get a chance to try it out			2
the teacher dialed into the central office computer , logged in and started the math program			1
i felt like a new world opened for me			2
for the first time in my life , i saw something that made me imagine what i wanted to do when i grew up			2
that junior high school computer math program lead me to computer classes in high school			1
there , i learned of an @entity57 sponsored by @entity58			2
for the next couple of years i built a friendship with a group of people who had interests similar to mine -- some closer than others			0
we would play with computers at school , in @entity69 , in stores like @entity71 and at home			0
finally in 1982 , i bought my first computer			1
some of my friends already had computers and now my time came and i finally got my own			0
i purchased a @entity77 h - 89 , which we built in a friend 's basement			0
at the same time i also bought a @entity82 309 baud @entity83			0
i used my computer and modem to log onto electronic bulletin board systems , or @entity87 , and create more friendships and acquaintances			1
we were a curious group and we were eager to learn more and more about the different computers made and how they worked			0
we ended up getting into about a dozen computer systems -- from the @entity92 in @entity93 to a major international bank system in @entity95 to the @entity96 in @entity97 , one of only two @entity100 laboratories dedicated to nuclear weapons research			1
we were really just looking around and playing games on these systems ; we did n't want to harm anything			1
this was pretty easy because computers back then were built with a basic set of login information , all of it written in the manuals			0
we did n't see any harm in it			0
we would share information with each other about any particularly interesting system we connected to and , when we got together for @entity116 , we 'd talk about exploring , not harming systems			1
at some point , we started calling our group the " 4 - 1 - 4s , " a name we came up with after hanging out at a local park			0
we noticed etchings on the tables with numbers like 1 - 9 and 2 - 7 , gang signatures that came from the streets where they operated			0
since we all lived in the @entity129 area , we more or less jokingly gave ourselves the gang name of 414s for the @entity129 area code			0
as the months went on , we started to notice issues staying connected with our modems for any length of time			0
then , the @entity6 showed up at my home			1
remember , back then home computers were very new , so there were no computer hacking laws			1
after about a year of back and forth with the @entity6 , three of us were eventually charged under a federal provision against harassing phone calls , which carried a maximum of six months in prison and a $ 500 fine each			1
as i sat before the judge with my lawyer , he asked why he should not give me prison time			0
i had recently met the love of my life and we were expecting our first child			1
so i explained that i would like to be around to see the birth of my baby and live a happy and normal family life			0
the judge agreed to a plea deal with a stipulation that i could not own a modem during the time i remained on probation			0
under the deal , we were charged with misdemeanors that carried two years ' probation and a $ 500 fine			0
our records would be expunged under the federal youth corrections act			0
today , more than 30 years later , i 'm still fascinated by computers : i 'm employed as a network engineer and , at home , i tinker around on about half a dozen computers			0
oh , and i 'm still married to the love of my life			1
the things that we did set the stage for more than just our personal career paths : we helped create several federal laws that are still on the books for computer crime and password safety			1
it makes me proud as a network engineer working partially in security knowing that , in a way , what we did as a group made for safer computing today			0
there are still lots of issues with people using simple passwords , companies leaving too many doors open and just the massive amounts of computing power available to work on decoding and breaking into systems			1
we could have caused some damage to these companies and many were surprised that we just looked around and played games			1
today , hacking is a whole different world .			0

as a teen , @entity208 fell in love with exploring computer systems around the nation
when the @entity6 showed up , that exploration caused some trouble
