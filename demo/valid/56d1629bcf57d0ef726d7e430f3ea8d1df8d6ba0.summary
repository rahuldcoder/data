@entity1 five years ago , @entity1 @entity0 went on a trip to @entity4			0
what he encountered left him confused but intrigued			0
a science graduate from @entity8 's elite @entity7 , he had been taught to mistrust superstition and religion , but in the culture and devotion of the @entity13 he met he found something worth knowing			1
now 25 , he is considering giving up his job and becoming a monk			0
" it means i will have to give up everything of the ordinary world , " he told @entity2			0
while @entity22 has a long history in @entity8 , entering via missionaries from @entity20 during the @entity21 , it was repressed during the @entity25 era -- many monasteries and temples were destroyed during the @entity28 and monks actively punished for believing in " superstition			1
" but now , a growing number of @entity8 are rediscovering the country 's dormant @entity33 traditions			1
some , like @entity0 , are looking for a spiritual anchor in a competitive , fast - changing society			0
others take comfort in meditation and enjoy volunteering			0
however , it 's not always easy to combine @entity33 beliefs with the demands of modern life			1
@entity0 works as an assistant to the boss of an environmental company			0
his religion means it 's difficult to entertain clients and partners -- a key part of the role			2
" not drinking , smoking or eating meat affects my socializing			0
so the company has to send someone else to go with me , which creates extra expenses , " he says			0
@entity0 has not told his family about his desire to become a monk yet , fearing that they might oppose it			0
@entity64 , the director of the @entity65 and @entity66 at @entity67 , @entity68 , says it 's difficult to explain exactly why so many young people are turning to @entity22			1
some discover it at university , where @entity33 groups are active and famous monks and lamas give lectures			1
others have devout parents and grandparents			0
he also says that the @entity84 policy has " moved toward treating @entity22 more favorably than other religions			1
" @entity85 has also been growing in popularity in recent decades but church leaders say there has been a crackdown on @entity85 , with authorities demolishing churches and removing crosses from skylines			2
in particular , it 's the @entity95 strain of @entity22 , rather than the @entity96 ( also called @entity96 ) tradition once popular in @entity8 , that is attracting new converts , particularly students , young professionals and businesspeople , he says			1
" it appears that both the chanting and the physical , spiritual practices of @entity22 are appealing to some people , " @entity64 added			1
to what extent these new converts are committed to @entity22 as a religion , with its strictures and rituals , is an open question			1
a former leader of a university @entity22 group , who did n't want to give his name , told @entity2 he thought its members were more interested in the religion as a lifestyle choice			1
activities that his group organized focusing on relaxation and stress relief were always more popular than reading groups and lectures that examined @entity33 scriptures , he added			1
@entity64 at @entity67 says that for most people in @entity8 , @entity22 is treated more as culture than a religion			1
they may visit temples or read @entity33 books , but few people treat it as a religion that requires serious commitment			2
" indeed , people who identify as @entity13 do a lot of @entity139 spiritual things , such as believing in feng shui , consulting fortune - tellers , practicing qi gong and sampling books and practices of other religions , " he says			0
on a recent weekend , more than four hundred people attended the annual gathering of @entity148 , a @entity33 charitable organization , at @entity149 on the mountainous outskirts of the capital			2
@entity152 , the group 's 32 - year - old deputy secretary general , said the group 's most active volunteers were between 20 and 35 years old			2
in the past five years their numbers had doubled to 200			0
for attendee @entity158 , a 26 - year - old who works and lives in @entity1 , @entity22 was something she rediscovered after returning from studying abroad in @entity160			2
growing up , her family had raised her @entity33 although she says she never really " felt it			1
" she now regularly attends meditation activities in monasteries or study groups organized by volunteers			0
@entity158 says @entity22 has given her a fresh outlook on life and past difficulties			1
it 's also helped her establish a network of people she can talk to and socialize with			2
" we sit together , sharing things that have happened in our lives and how we dealt with them , which is more helpful than reading books " , she says			0
for @entity0 , the aspiring monk , @entity22 has been a balm while dealing with poor health , as well as work and relationship problems			2
" my life has been tough for years			0
( @entity22 ) keeps me away from the negative thoughts , like a reminder that 's always there , which has helped me a lot			1
" journalist @entity186 contributed to this report .			0
