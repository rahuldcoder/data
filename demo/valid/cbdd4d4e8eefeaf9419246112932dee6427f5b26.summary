@entity16 having been @entity2 's spokesman and strategist for a decade and more , having been at his side through election campaigns , wars and peace processes , political and personal crises , scandals galore , having spent thousands of hours facing down possibly the most questioning media on the planet , and having done thousands of talks and interviews since leaving @entity15 's side , i am very experienced in answering difficult questions			1
but right now , i am struggling and i thought a little bit of crowd sourcing with the highly intelligent men -- and especially the women -- who visit @entity17 might help			1
this is something i would never have considered before the advent of the blogosphere and social media , but where better now to start than at the home of the likes of @entity30 and @entity31			2
so here is the situation			2
as you might know from a chat i had on @entity17 with @entity30 last month , i have written my 11th book			1
it is called " winners : and how they succeed			2
" it looks at hyper - achievers in sport , business and politics , interviews some of the biggest and most successful names alive -- and analyses some who are dead -- and tries to draw general lessons for all of us			2
it is going very well thank you			2
not least thanks to media interest and a host of events , at which it has been snapped up variously at gatherings for students , business people , football fans , environmentalists and political activists , it has gone within four days of publication to number 1 in the @entity66 hardback non-fiction charts			2
i would be lying -- something i am not prone to do whatever the haters may say -- if i said i was not seriously chuffed about this			0
as my former @entity72 colleague , now of @entity74 pr , @entity75 , said at the launch : " if you write a book called ' winners ' and it goes straight to the charity shops , do n't be surprised if people call you a loser			0
" fear of failure being a bigger driver for most of my interviewees than any joy in success , this was not something i was prepared to allow			0
so what is the problem as i look down from the top of the @entity94 charts at those reviewers who said it was awful ? ( i would incidentally have preferred no stars in the @entity98 to the one that they gave me			0
please take note for next time			0
) the problem is women , or more precisely how i talk about them			1
at every single one of the nine or so events i have so far done about the book , and in several of the many interviews , i have been asked -- usually but not always by a woman -- a version of this same question : " do men and women win in different ways ? " and i do n't really know what to say			1
so help me please @entity114			0
at the first event , hosted by the @entity115 , my partner @entity116 and my daughter @entity117 were sitting in the front row , squirming as i told how i had written a chapter on the @entity120 , named @entity122 chancellor @entity121 as the most impressive current political leader , interviewed and profiled @entity126 @entity125 editor @entity124 as my main voice on leadership , done the same with @entity129 as a great innovator , talked to gymnast @entity131 about her " perfect 10 , " and presented paralympian athlete and @entity134 and @entity136 surfer @entity135 as two of the best interviews about resilience			1
as @entity117 said afterwards -- well to be honest she heckled me at the time with the words " shut up @entity144 , this is embarrassing , " -- i was answering a question i had not been asked , namely " why are n't there more women in the book ? ' rather than the one i had been asked , " do men and women win in different ways ? " at my next outing , in front of the amazingly bright international postgrad students at @entity155 , with @entity117 not there to heckle , but @entity116 sitting three yards from me , the same question came again almost word for word			1
as the above names were reeled out once more i sensed i needed something more than a list			0
i needed an argument , the likes of which i used to specialize in framing and honing			0
so i waffled a bit about glass ceilings and how @entity116 's generation had won the battle for women 's equality in the eyes of the law but @entity117 's generation needed to win the battle in terms of the culture of the land			1
i thought that was quite good , and dare i say a rather decent soundbite			0
but moderator @entity179 clearly did n't agree and handed his microphone to @entity116 to ask her for her view			0
she said it was still a man 's world and women had essentially to do twice as many jobs as men			1
men also did n't appreciate either that reality , or that it therefore becomes harder for a woman to win than a man in many sets of circumstances			1
she got a round of applause before the twitterati took to social media to say she had put me in my place			0
the row in the car on the way home was reasonably good - natured , considering my partner of 36 years was basically confirming i was not a new man and suggesting i talked absolute tosh about whether men and women win in different ways			1
at my next event , a @entity209 fundraiser , thankfully neither @entity116 nor @entity117 could make it			0
so when the same bloody question came up again i started off with my list of names but stupidly mentioned the @entity120 first promoting a left - leaning chorus of " for heaven 's sake she is hardly typical , " so that by the time i got to @entity116 's point , i was struggling again			1
@entity220 knows what would have happened if i had said @entity222 was in there , in the section comparing her leadership to @entity226 's ( sic )			1
but here is the thing			0
afterwards a woman who shall be nameless -- but she does work for @entity232 , the chief architect of @entity209 's new feminism and the proud leader of the pink campaign bus tour ( which i love by the way ) -- said this to me : " you have to come back and do more in the campaign			1
because i think there is something of a crisis of masculinity in @entity66 politics right now			0
" in other words there 's me trying to get the right answer to a question that has genuinely been troubling me , and an arch feminist says i need to do more of the @entity251 thing			1
you ca n't win , said i. so come on			2
this question has come up everywhere i have been			2
i have more events to do			0
and the next time i sit down with @entity17 's woman winners , @entity30 or @entity31 , i need to have a better answer than the ones i have been deploying thus far			1
@entity260 signed book and invite to a future event for the best suggestion			0
either here in the @entity66 now or in what i believe @entity126 call the fall when it comes out there .			0

@entity269 wants @entity17 users to help him answer the question : " do men and women win in different ways ? "
his wife told one audience it was still a man 's world and women had essentially to do twice as many jobs as men
