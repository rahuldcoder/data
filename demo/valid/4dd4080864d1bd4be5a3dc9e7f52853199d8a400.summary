@entity0 , @entity1 so what has @entity5 subcontractor @entity3 been up to since he was released from a @entity1 prison exactly three months ago ? it turns out a lot more than most of the rest of us			1
@entity3 , 65 , has started to make up for the five years he spent imprisoned in @entity1 by traveling abroad , attending the @entity12 as a guest of the @entity14 and last week meeting @entity13 at the @entity16 to personally thank him for his role in helping to win @entity3 ' freedom			1
after five years of being disconnected from the outside world , @entity3 now frequently posts on social media , writing of family reunions , eating the foods he longed for in prison and the reminders he experiences of his time in @entity1			1
" i ca n't get away from @entity1 , " @entity3 wrote after hearing a @entity1 song playing in an airport on his travels			1
while visiting @entity30 , he posted a photo of @entity33 cigars advertised for sale in a @entity36 tobacco shop			0
in 2009 , @entity3 was arrested by @entity1 state security agents and eventually sentenced to 15 years in prison for importing banned communications equipment to the island			2
@entity3 said he was merely helping the island 's small @entity42 community get online , but @entity1 officials accused of him being part of a @entity47 government plot to destabilize the island 's single - party communist government			1
@entity1 has highly restricted internet access , and most people are not able to access the web in their homes or on their phones			0
on december 17 , 2014 , @entity3 was freed , along with three @entity1 intelligence agents and a @entity1 man convicted of spying for the @entity47			1
it was part of a deal between the @entity1 and @entity47 governments to reestablish diplomatic relations after five decades of @entity62 animosity			1
gross , his wife , @entity64 , his attorney and three @entity47 congressmen flew from @entity0 to his home state of @entity68 aboard a @entity47 military jet , one of the smaller versions of @entity72 used to transport president @entity73			0
the image of @entity3 celebrating his freedom aboard the flight home with @entity2 reporting the news of his release on a tv screen in the background became the picture he would use on his @ @entity82			2
the night of his release , he enjoyed a meal of spicy @entity86 food with family and friends , a far cry from the bland rations he was forced to eat in prison			0
in january , @entity3 changed the status of his @entity94 page to read that he had left his job as " hostage " at the @entity98 military hospital where had been held in @entity0			0
later , he shared pictures of a visit to the dentist 's office to replace the teeth that he lost while he was held in @entity1			2
with his dental concerns met , he moved on to food			0
@entity3 also recounted savoring long - denied bowls of chili and bagels loaded with lox and cream cheese			2
many of the posts are the daily jottings of a man returning to his life after an extended absence : gross renewing an expired driver 's license or visiting a @entity118 for the first time in five years			0
but in other posts , he writes about taking in a sunset on the beach in @entity30 , seeing the snow fall in @entity124 and believing citizens in every country should have unimpeded access to the @entity128			0
a spokeswoman for @entity3 turned down a @entity2 request for an interview with him but confirmed that the social media accounts are his			0
rep. @entity133 , the @entity134 representing the @entity68 district @entity3 hails from , called it " incredibly moving " that a man who spent five years in a @entity1 prison has since sat next to first lady @entity139 and met the pope			1
more than that , he 's come to signify the changing dynamics between officials in @entity124 and @entity0			2
" @entity3 did not ask for this special role in history , " @entity133 said , " but he 's become a catalyst for this new chapter in @entity47 and @entity1 relations			1
" the photos that @entity3 posted online show a smiling man , slowly putting back on some of the 100 pounds he lost in prison , no longer the gaunt - faced , hollow - eyed prisoner who had gone on hunger strikes to protest his conditions while he was held in @entity1			1
" the distance we 've come since december 17th 2014 has been a rewarding journey , " @entity3 wrote in a @entity94 post saturday			0
" for which we 're grateful			0

rep. @entity133 : @entity3 became " a catalyst " for next chapter in @entity47 - @entity1 relations
@entity3 has been a guest of the @entity14 , got to meet @entity13 since release from @entity1
