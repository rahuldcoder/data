@entity2 militants in northern @entity4 released 19 @entity6 hostages sunday , an activist group said			1
according to the @entity8 - based @entity7 , all but one of the hostages were among the at least 220 @entity11 captured on february 23 during an attack on villages in the northern @entity4 province of @entity15			2
the @entity4 observatory had said previously that a self - proclaimed @entity2 court ordered the release of 29 @entity6 hostages , citing an @entity11 commander			1
the reasoning behind the release was not immediately clear			0
it was also not clear why only 19 people were let go sunday			2
the " court " told the commander that the fate of the other kidnapped @entity11 has yet to be decided by @entity28 jurists			1
when the decision was announced that at least some of the hostages would be released , @entity30 , with the @entity31 , said he was pleased to hear about it , but not entirely surprised			0
" @entity2 has claimed for a long time to follow rules , and it claims that these @entity38 courts will impose limits , " he told @entity3			2
" they can attempt to get credibility by showing that they follow rules and that they have some kind of transparent process that follows their particular implementation of @entity38 law			0
" also this weekend , the @entity7 reported that @entity2 has killed 1,969 people , since the declaration of its " caliphate " last june			2
nearly two - thirds of them -- 1,238 people -- were civilians			0
six were children and eight were women , the group said			0
of the rest , 95 were fighters from the @entity60 - affiliated rebel group @entity59 , the @entity4 observatory said , and 511 were officers and soldiers of regime forces			1
@entity2 also executed 125 of its own members for " exceeding the limits in religion , " the @entity4 observatory said			1
" we in @entity7 believe that the real number of people that had been killed by ( @entity2 ) is higher than the number documented by @entity7 because there are hundreds of missing and detainees inside the ( @entity2 ) jails , loss of communication with about 1,000 men of @entity79 tribe , ( and ) dozens of @entity80 who have still been missing " since @entity2 attacked the @entity4 town of @entity83 in september			1

it 's *unclear* what will become of the other kidnapped @entity11
