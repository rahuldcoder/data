@entity2 within 48 hours of his election night victory , @entity0 rolled back his pre-election comments that there would be no @entity7 state if he were prime minister , but the damage may already have been done to relations with the two other major players in the negotiations : the @entity12 and the @entity7			1
in an interview with @entity14 , @entity0 said , " i have n't changed my policy , i never retracted my speech six years ago calling for a demilitarized @entity7 state that recognizes the jewish state			1
what has changed is the reality , @entity21 ( nickhame of @entity22 president @entity21 ) the @entity7 leader refuses to recognize the jewish state , and he 's made a pact with @entity26 that calls for the destruction of @entity28			1
and every territory vacated these days in the @entity30 is taken up by @entity32 forces and we want that to change so we can realize the vision of real sustained peace			0
i do n't want a one - state solution , i want a sustainable two - state solution			0
" chief @entity7 negotiator @entity39 says he believes the pre-election statement that @entity0 will not allow a two - state solution			1
he says the @entity7 will keep pursuing statehood through the international arena instead of through negotiations			2
" i 've negotiated with them for 20 years , and i complained to the international community that there is a big difference between someone being a tough negotiator which is legitimate and someone being a non-negotiator , " @entity39 said			0
" all @entity0 needs to do to gain the credibility and the trust , not only of me but of the international community , he needs to stand tall and tell the @entity28 people that in order to live in peace with our neighbors we 're going to have to recognize the state of @entity64			1
" @entity39 says the @entity7 may try again for recognition once more at the @entity66 , a forum where they fell one vote short of recognition as a full @entity66 member state in december			1
a new @entity66 @entity71 consisting of different member states may be more favorable to a second @entity7 bid			2
so where does that leave the @entity12 ? the @entity76 said it would " reassess " the relationship between the @entity12 and @entity28			1
the broad relationship includes security cooperation , financial assistance , and strong diplomatic ties			0
both leaders reaffirmed the strength of those ties in the weeks before the @entity28 elections			0
but the @entity12 has also used its veto power as a permanent member of the @entity71 to block resolutions unfavorable to @entity28			1
some of that protection could be at stake here as the @entity76 urges both sides back to negotiations			2
the last peace talks , moderated by secretary of state @entity94 , broke down in april 2014 after nine months of negotiations			0
as the talks deteriorated before the scheduled deadline , @entity28 withdrew from the negotiations when @entity99 announced a reconciliation with @entity26 , a militant @entity101 group , and an intention to form a unity government			0
in a phone call with @entity0 , president @entity104 congratulated @entity0 and stressed the importance of a two - state solution			2
but with so much skepticism on both sides , a lasting peace remains a distant goal .			0

the @entity76 says it would " reassess " the relationship between the @entity12 and @entity28
that comes after @entity0 made *campaign* statements against a @entity7 state
@entity0 rolled back the comments after his election victory
