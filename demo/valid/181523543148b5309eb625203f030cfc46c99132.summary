the gift of an inquiring mind can be both exhilarating and torturous			1
my job is to ask tough questions , but when it comes to faith , @entity10 , and religion , the more questions i ask in my quest for truth and understanding , the more complex the answers become			1
i was a bit of a rebellious child			1
my mom might tell you differently , but i never saw that as a bad trait			1
i felt that if i questioned authority , fought for the underdog , battled for the things that people told me were impossible , i would be different			1
that same rebellious spirit also led to things that definitely were not good for me , like hanging with the wrong crowd and getting into the type of trouble that i would rather not put in print			1
that 's when i " found @entity10			1
" i became a " born - again " @entity33 when i attended a @entity35 camp in high school			1
my home life was n't exactly going swimmingly , and this group really embraced me			2
i loved the @entity33 notion of community , giving back , praying for others and making friends that cared more about doing good than getting drunk , smoking pot and having sex			1
i opened my arms to @entity47 and fully embraced @entity33 morals and principles			1
i decided that i was going to be " that good girl " and go on to do great things			2
i started off at @entity52 , a beautiful @entity33 college nestled in the heart of @entity55 , @entity56			1
what a safe place that was			2
it was also extremely nurturing			2
the professors dedicated bountiful amounts of time to our individual spiritual development , and regularly prayed with us			1
my peer group was all about what ministry you signed up for , not what sorority you were rushing			2
we lifted each other up , had intimate @entity71 studies on the beach and spent hours hanging out with friends , talking about how to lead a godly life			2
as glorious and fulfilling as all that appeared , two years into college , the world became much larger to me			1
more complex , diverse , intellectually and spiritually challenging			2
it became the world of church , religion and faith versus the world of ideas , cultures , and philosophies			2
i found myself more drawn to @entity88 than the book of @entity90			2
a good friend gave me a book , @entity93			2
it posed these questions : " do you ever feel somewhat schizophrenic about the relationship of your faith to the rest of your life ? do you find yourself compartmentalizing different aspects so that tensions between them are minimized ? " the answer to all of these for me was : yes			0
i started to read a lot			0
i wanted to mesh with a myriad of thinkers , and religious scholars			0
i needed to make a change			0
i left @entity52 after my sophomore year and transferred to @entity112 's @entity111			1
i discovered i had too many questions about faith to pursue a life of ministry , but i felt good about this transition			0
to me , it made perfect sense , because like ministers , true journalists love people , listen well and want to make a difference within this universe			0
meet the friendly atheists next door the key difference is , in journalism , if we gather the " facts , " we can usually find the answers to what we 're looking for			0
when it comes to @entity10 , @entity47 and the @entity134 , those answers rest in faith			0
as a journalist , i seek intellectual certainty			0
when it came to my faith , i felt intellectually embarrassed			0
there was so much i just could n't explain			0
when i started working on a documentary about the growth of atheism , i found myself in a profound place of reflection			0
in the days when i thought i was going to pursue a life of ministry , i experienced and felt many things that were unexplainable			0
what was that ? @entity10 ? a higher power ? energy ? or just good karma for trying to lead such a generous and selfless life ? there is no way to know			0
my stepfather , who grew up in -- but later left -- the @entity159 church has a perspective on religion that i find intriguing			1
he does n't believe in a @entity10 with a long white beard and flowing robes who sits upon a cloud guiding our daily lives			0
that concept is too abstract			0
but while he may not embrace " @entity10 - liness , " he does believe in " good - liness			1
" @entity10 , he told me in one of our many colorful spiritual discussions , is the " good " in humankind			1
he and i definitely agree that the concept of @entity10 should not be dismissed as having no meaning			0
to the contrary , it has a very important meaning , for it refers in symbolic language to the highest dimension of human existence , our spirituality			0
after years of spiritual reflection and inquiry , i am at a place where i do n't want to feel guilty , hypocritical , judgmental , closed - minded or arrogant			1
so , where do i stand now -- 30 years after " finding @entity10 , " questioning my faith , committing sins , seeking hazardous adventure and trying to love life and people to the best of my ability ? i am a " seeker			1
" a constant seeker within this world , among people and , of course , for spiritual enlightenment of all kind			1
because if i did possess the truth -- the " final answer " -- i am convinced i would spend the rest of my years missing out on the enrichment and surprise of seeking it			0
i guess i just love my exhilarating and torturous life .			0
