dame @entity2 , whose tart - tongued @entity3 has most of the best lines on " @entity5 , " caused a fuss this week when she implied that her beloved character wo n't be around much longer			1
" i mean , ( my character ) certainly ca n't keep going , " @entity2 told the @entity8			1
" to my knowledge , i must be 110 by now			2
we 're into the late 1920s			2
" no more @entity12 ? ! ? you could almost hear the genteel wails of protest on both sides of the @entity17			2
the speculation about @entity2 was hurriedly squashed by a " @entity5 " publicist , who said @entity2 , 80 , has agreed to stay with the series " for as long as the show runs			1
" but that did n't stop rumors about the demise of " @entity5 " itself from continuing to crop up			1
@entity2 even hinted during her interview with the @entity8 that the next season of the hit show would be its last			1
" they say this is the last one , and i ca n't see how it could go on , " @entity2 let drop			1
creator @entity32 is developing another period drama , " the @entity35 , " for @entity34 and has been noncommittal about how much longer the show might endure beyond season six , which is filming now			1
" it wo n't go on forever -- i 'm not a believer in that , " he told the @entity39 in a recent interview			2
" but i ca n't immediately now tell you where the end will be			2
" it is hard to imagine " @entity5 , " which just wrapped its fifth season on @entity48 in the @entity49 , without the wit and wisdom of @entity52 , whose acerbic commentary leaves few around her unscathed			1
so let 's hope @entity2 just misspoke			1
and until season six , which airs this fall in the @entity58 and early next year in the @entity49 , here are some of our favorite @entity60 zingers			1
-- @entity63 : " how you hate to be wrong			0
" @entity64 : " i would n't know , i 'm not familiar with the sensation			0
" -- @entity70 : " they do say there 's a wild man inside all of us			0
" @entity64 : " if only he would stay inside			0
" -- @entity63 : " i admire it when young people stand up for their principles			0
" @entity64 : " principles are like prayers ; noble , of course , but awkward at a party			0
" -- @entity64 ( to @entity78 ) : " i 'm so looking forward to seeing your mother again			0
when i 'm with her , i 'm reminded of the virtues of the @entity83			0
" @entity84 : " but is n't she @entity49 ? " @entity64 : " exactly			0
" -- @entity63 : " i take that as a compliment			0
" @entity52 : " i must have said it wrong			0
