the beauty of @entity1 -- a country blemished by wars , upheaval and the inhumane treatment of women by extremists -- has almost been forgotten by the world , and by many @entity1 themselves			1
in the last few decades , little attention has been paid to the other @entity1 : the sweet melodies , the kind people , and the beautiful land full of ancient wisdom and intersecting traditions			1
it would be irresponsible to solely focus on those positives while families are torn apart and the noise of war rings in people 's ears			2
generations of @entity1 have had their homes surrounded by battles and their lives punctuated by fear			1
@entity1 has been the largest refugee - producing country for 32 years			2
one out of every four refugees worldwide is @entity1 , according to the @entity31			1
recently , i was watching an engrossing reality tv show featuring singers when a friend peered over my shoulder and asked about the program			1
i explained that it was " @entity39 , " @entity1 's answer to " @entity41			1
" she was shocked by the set and the sophisticated arena stage where the stars were standing			0
that stage could easily have been in @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 or @entity50			0
this , i realized , is the @entity1 no one believes exists , or has ever existed			2
@entity1 has a rich tradition of music , poetry , and songs that have influenced its neighbors and any region of the world exposed to the @entity60			1
after all , the famous @entity62 poet @entity61 was from modern - day @entity1			2
i grew up across the river in @entity65 , hearing @entity1 songs and tales of the parties in @entity69 , and learning about @entity1 singers , who are beloved across the region			2
i started watching " @entity39 " last year after hearing about contestant @entity72 from @entity1 's remote northeastern province of @entity74 , who traveled 16 hours ( sometime on foot ) to @entity69 to audition for the show			1
this year , another contestant , @entity78 , also traveled from that remote region for a chance to audition			0
@entity78 told @entity81 , which produces " @entity39 , " that he did not have enough to eat and did n't have money for his commute to @entity69			2
but he knew , he said , that in this day and age , in his new @entity1 , he can hope , dream , and make things happen			2
@entity78 's story was so compelling , i have tuned in every week for months now to see what he will sing and whether he will be safe from elimination			2
he is now among the top three contestants			0
as i watched every show , the beacon of hope of a new @entity1 became clear to me			1
young men and women auditioned , speaking of peace and coexistence , supporting one another outside of tribes or ethnic lines			0
they wanted what my own children want -- the freedom to explore being a young adult and to follow their dreams			0
this is the new @entity1 -- the struggles around poverty , religion and resilience are ever - present , but hope shines through in ways that make everyday life brighter			1
" @entity39 " is a source of pride , happiness and escape for many @entity1			1
when you talk to any @entity1 around the world , they know all about the contestants and the judges			1
they openly give their opinions and feel that they are a part of the process ; anyone around the world can vote via sms and call - ins			0
the panel of judges acts as an amplifier for the voices of the vulnerable , bringing attention to orphans , poverty , and the plight of women			0
this grounded attitude is meaningful because each one of the judges is a living legend in @entity1 -- superstars who also have their own war stories to tell			1
the stalwart female judge , @entity144 , comes from a family of famous composers and singers			0
last year told the contestants a heart - wrenching story about her father 's life abroad as a refugee and how she believes her father " died of homesickness			0
" her presence on the panel of judges is a reminder that women are strong , women do not need to be veiled , and that female contestants who audition should be championed			0
there is a beacon of hope in just looking at how much the show has changed in its 10 seasons			0
during the first season , after years of the @entity169 's ban on music , a female contestant performed without a hijab , resulting in death threats			0
the young woman had to go into hiding			0
this season , for @entity177 , the show celebrated @entity1 women			1
male contestants dedicated songs and presented flowers to the women , singing of the strength of @entity1 mothers			2
a young woman performed , dancing with her hair flowing freely			0
the show ended with a dedication to @entity1 poetess @entity190			1
@entity190 studied literature in secret during the @entity169 occupation , becoming a well - known published poet before her husband killed her at age 25			0
he found her writings inappropriate and a stain on his honor			0
the beautiful irony is that @entity190 's words live on in books and songs today			0
@entity144 performed a song that put @entity190 's poetry to music			0
wearing an @entity1 flag around her shoulders , her hair uncovered , she brought @entity190 's words to life : " i am not that weak willow tree that trembles with the wind			1
" i am an @entity1 woman and so i wail			2
" with three contestants left , the show will end friday night , appropriately on @entity216 , the @entity213 celebrated in @entity1 , @entity65 and @entity217			1
though @entity78 was my initial reason for watching the show , i will be happy no matter which contestant becomes the " @entity39			1
" the reality is we are all winners because of one tv program			0
those living as refugees and those living abroad by choice , away from the homeland , get a taste of the music and culture of their birth country , sparking renewed belief in the new @entity1			1
and people in @entity1 are given glimpses of what the new @entity1 can look like -- a vision of young men and women free from war , who can pursue their dreams .			1

" @entity39 " is @entity1 's answer to " @entity41 "
but the tv show is more -- it gives @entity1 refugees and the world a look at a changing *society*
