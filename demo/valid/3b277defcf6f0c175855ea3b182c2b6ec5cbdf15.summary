in an unusual turn of events last week , a terror plot suspect 's desire to talk to local media put him at odds with his attorneys and landed a @entity9 television station in federal court			1
at issue was a taped audio interview with @entity13 and whether the station could broadcast that interview			1
@entity13 is accused of plotting to attack the @entity17 @entity16			1
the 20 - year - old -- who claims in the interview that he is affiliated with @entity20 -- was arrested on january 14 , months after his social media habits and talk of jihad put him on the @entity25 's radar , according to court documents obtained by @entity5 at the time of his arrest			1
two days after his arrest , a court order was issued barring public contact with @entity13 , who is being held at the @entity32 across the river in @entity34			1
last week , @entity35 made a collect call to @entity5 affiliate @entity37 , said news director @entity38			1
that phone call initiated what ended up being an hourlong interview , @entity38 said			2
@entity13 's attorney , @entity42 , argued that @entity37 was in contempt of court for violating a january order " directing the detention facility holding the defendant not to permit outside contact by anyone with the defendant without [ defense counsel 's ] express approval			1
" @entity13 spoke with reporter @entity52			1
in that interview , he refuses to tell @entity52 how or when he first came in contact with @entity20 , but he did give the reporter details on a plot to kill president @entity57 , members of @entity59 , as well as an attack on the @entity62 embassy in @entity63			1
" i would have took my gun , " he said			2
" i would have put it to @entity57 's head			2
i would have pulled the trigger			2
then i would unleash more bullets on the @entity69 and @entity71 members			2
and i would have attacked the @entity62 embassy and various other buildings full of @entity74 who want to wage war against us @entity78			2
" when @entity52 asked him why he would plot such an attack , he said " @entity57 is an enemy of @entity80 , therefore an enemy of us , of @entity82			2
" he said his plan for an attack on the @entity17 @entity16 was retaliation for " the continued @entity17 aggression against our people and the fact that @entity17 , specifically president @entity57 , wants to wage war against @entity82			1
" @entity13 told @entity52 he was planning what would have been a " major attack " to take place in @entity63 on september 20 , repeatedly referring to himself as a member of @entity20			1
" i 'm with the @entity82 , " he said at one point			2
" i have connections with many brothers over there			2
we 've been corresponding for quite some time now , actually			0
the @entity25 finally caught on this past year			0
" @entity13 told @entity52 that he used " encrypted messaging " to communicate with @entity20 members			1
he said they discussed " how we should wage jihad in @entity17			0
we should form our own groups and alliances with the @entity82 , " he continued			0
@entity13 said he was serious about his plans			1
" i 'm very dedicated , " he told @entity52			0
" like i said , i 'm a @entity78			0
i 'm so dedicated that i risked my life			0
that should say a whole lot			0
" he also warned that there were others like himself			0
" we are indeed here in @entity17 , " he said			0
" we 're in each and every state			0
we 're here in @entity117			0
we 're more organized than you think			0
" the interview was taped in three 20 - minute segments and was recorded by the jail and @entity37			0
@entity38 said the jail 's taping system only allows for 20 minutes of taping at one time , so each time the recording would stop and the phone call ended , @entity35 called the station back to tell his side of the story			1
@entity5 listened to the audio recording			0
during the 6:30 p.m. newscast on thursday , the station aired a brief clip of the audio recording , previewing a longer story that was to air later that night , in the 10 p.m. newscast			0
according to @entity136 , legal analyst and attorney for @entity37 , a producer from the station called him about 7:30 thursday evening ; @entity13 's attorney had filed a " show of cause " order in @entity9 's federal court and an emergency hearing was scheduled for 8:30 p.m. during that hearing , the judge continued the case for friday morning and @entity37 agreed to delay broadcasting the interview until friday , pending a decision			1
in addition to the contempt of court argument , @entity151 - @entity42 was also asking the court to issue a restraining order against the station , an order that would keep the station from broadcasting the interview with @entity35 , according to court documents			1
during the hearing , which lasted five hours , a lieutenant at the @entity32 facility testified that one of @entity13 's attorneys had given him a phone			1
in that testimony the lieutenant stated that he reminded the attorney that giving @entity35 a phone meant he would be able to call anyone he wanted to , which seemed at odds with the spirit of the january court order			1
at the end of friday 's hearing , @entity17 district judge @entity174 ruled that the order prohibiting @entity35 from contact with the public was vaguely written and the station was not in violation of the order			1
additionally , the judge ruled it would be unconstitutional for the news station to be barred from broadcasting the interview , according to @entity136			0
the judge also stated in court that while @entity35 has the right to remain silent , he also has the right to freedom of speech			1
" at the end of the day , the judge made the right decision , " @entity136 said			0
@entity5 on saturday reached out to @entity42 , @entity35 's defense attorney , but so far has received no response			2
@entity37 aired a portion of the interview on friday night , and plans to broadcast more this week			0
