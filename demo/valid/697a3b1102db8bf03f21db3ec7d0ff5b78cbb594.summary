the couple arrived in @entity10 on tuesday evening			0
many people will remember @entity0 from the day in july 1981 when , as a dashing young prince , he kissed his shy bride , @entity13 , on the balcony of @entity15 in front of the eyes of the world			1
but many things have changed since then , including their divorce , @entity13 's death in a car accident in 1997 and his marriage to @entity1 , now @entity1			1
here are five things to know about the @entity0 : while a lot of attention in recent years has been focused on his sons , princes @entity28 and @entity29 , @entity0 is next in line to the @entity32 throne			1
his mother , @entity33 , has ruled for more than 60 years ( in fact , in september she is expected to overtake her great - great - grandmother queen @entity35 for the title of @entity32 's longest - reigning monarch			1
) her longevity is welcomed by her subjects , but it means that @entity0 , at age 66 , has spent a long time as a monarch - in - waiting			1
he 's also now a grandfather , thanks to the birth of @entity44 in 2013			0
@entity0 and @entity1 tied the knot on april 9 , 2005			1
the couple first visited the @entity4 together as newlyweds , and @entity1 was confronted by hard - core princess @entity13 fans with abusive placards			1
polls at the time found that between 57 % and 73 % of @entity52 opposed @entity0 ' new wife being known as queen			1
if you go back even further , to 1997 , the year @entity13 died , an @entity56 poll put it at 86 %			0
but there 's been a change in sentiment since they married			0
a new poll conducted by @entity64 for @entity3 found that only 35 % now oppose @entity1 being known as queen			2
nearly one in four said they liked her more now than they did 10 years ago			0
in an exclusive interview with @entity3 royal correspondent @entity69 , @entity0 opened up about the couple 's relationship			2
he met @entity1 years before he wed @entity13 , who famously said in a 1995 @entity73 interview that " there were three of us in this marriage , so it was a bit crowded			2
" reporter 's notebook : interviewing the royal couple the prince has admitted talking to his plants in past tv interviews , inviting ridicule from some quarters			2

@entity0 has riled some people over the years with his outspoken views on architecture , which prioritize the traditional over the modern			1
in 1984 , he made headlines when he described a proposed modern extension to the @entity111 in @entity2 as " a monstrous carbuncle , " according to news reports from the time			0
he 's also invited controversy by reportedly writing to ministers -- and even the prime minister -- on subjects close to his heart			0
this intervention in the public sphere has troubled those who believe the royals should not get involved in such debates and worry that , once king , @entity0 may not remain above politics in the way that his mother has			2
in a piece published by @entity130 in december , @entity0 explained his thinking on architecture , saying " designing places according to the human scale and with nature at the heart of the process has always been my central concern			1
