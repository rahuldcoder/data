with majorities in both chambers of @entity3 , it is time for @entity5 to begin rolling back six years of failed @entity7 administration policies			2
our highest priority during the ongoing budget debate should be undoing the damage caused by defense sequestration and the hundreds of billions of dollars of defense cuts made by the @entity7 administration			1
regrettably , military strength is seen in many quarters as the cause of military adventurism			0
a strong , robust defense is seen not to deter aggression , but to provoke it			1
for years , we have systematically underfunded our military , marrying a philosophy of retreat with a misplaced understanding of our larger budgetary burdens and the real drivers of the debt : our entitlement programs			0
as expected , almost four years after the passage of the @entity31 , virtually nothing has been done to address the unsustainable growth of our entitlement programs , while essential defense programs have been sacrificed			2
political leaders in @entity35 need to be reminded that our defense is the single most important responsibility of the federal government			2
instead of starting the process by setting arbitrary defense spending levels and then forcing our military to cut vital programs in order to meet these levels , the budgeting process should start by taking into account all the threats against us , listing the programs and capabilities we 'll need to protect our people and interests around the world , and then funding those efforts			1
even though we 've been able to keep the homeland safe for more than a decade , the threats to @entity54 at home and abroad are growing			1
from the rise of the @entity60 and the spread of @entity63 terrorism , to @entity65 's aggression in @entity66 , to @entity68 expansionism in the @entity69 , the threats to @entity54 security are growing			1
yet , even as the world outside our borders is filled with more doubt and uncertainty , the @entity54 has been steadily reducing our spending on defense			1
even before sequestration , president @entity7 made defense cuts of $ 487 billion over 10 years and redirected the savings to already bloated domestic programs			1
this was followed by tens of billions more in defense cuts each year because of sequestration , which , when combined with @entity7 's prior cuts , will total $ 1 trillion over the coming decade			1
all of these reductions were enacted despite the warnings of four secretaries of defense and our entire military leadership			2
the results of these cuts have been disastrous for our military and for our ability to project power and deter our enemies			2
the slight increase in president @entity7 's proposed 2016 budget wo n't significantly change that			2
at the end of this process , our military will be significantly smaller , dramatically less capable and dangerously unready to deploy if these budget cuts remain in place			1
the @entity102 is on the path to be reduced to @entity105 levels			0
the @entity106 is at @entity108 levels			0
and our @entity109 has the smallest and oldest combat force in its history			0
our force reductions have been felt throughout the world -- by our friends and our enemies			0
they have presented not just a crisis of readiness for @entity54 , but also a perilous strategic weakness			1
our adversaries have been emboldened by what they perceive as our diminished military presence			0
history has shown that every time we have unreasonably cut resources from our military in anticipation of a peace dividend , it has only cost us more to make up for the deficit we create in military readiness and capability , and the expected era of perpetual peace fails to materialize			0
we think we are saving money , but in the long run , we end up paying more and creating more risk and uncertainty			0
we can afford the military we need , but we must make it a priority			0
for this reason , we introduced an amendment to the @entity142 budget resolution this week to address the dangerous funding gap our military currently faces			2
we believe we must increase the resources available to our military to the levels proposed by ( former ) defense secretary @entity146 in his @entity148 budget , the last defense budget based solely on an assessment of the threats we face and the requisite military needs to deal with those threats			1
it is the budget that the bipartisan , congressionally - mandated @entity155 stated was " the minimum required to reverse course and set the military on a more stable footing			2
" now that @entity5 control both house of @entity3 , it is time to support a defense budget that actually reflects the world in which we live , not the world the way we wish it was			1
until now , our approach as a country and a party since the @entity31 has not been one of @entity54 strength			1
continuing on the current path will only invite war and conflict through weakness			0
we need to heed the bipartisan warnings of our nation 's military leaders and get back on track toward a defense budget that reflects the realities of the challenges we face and is worthy of our brave men and women in uniform			1
in the end , it is they who will suffer the most if sequestration is not reversed and our readiness and equipment continues to degrade			0
as members of @entity3 , we have a sacred obligation to ensure that they have the best possible training and equipment so they can successfully complete their missions			0
despite the fiscal constraints imposed on our military , they are doing their part and are holding up their end of the bargain			0
it 's time that we hold up ours .			0

senators @entity207 , @entity208 : as threats have grown , @entity54 defense budget has faced cuts
they say spending to strengthen @entity54 forces is a necessity
