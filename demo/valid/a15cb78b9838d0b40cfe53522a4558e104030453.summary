, march of 2015 two women , both , curiously , named " @entity8 , " recline and sip their drinks at they stare at the blue - green water , occasionally checking their addictive mobile devices for new emails , conversing about the third season of " @entity15 " and the political mess in @entity17			1
they 're both bold progressives and @entity18 more by default than enthusiasm			2
the two @entity21 are debating whether sen. @entity22 should respond to the calls from the @entity24 and others for her to enter the 2016 race , challenging likely frontrunner @entity27			1
@entity28 desperately and impatiently wants the world to be a fairer and more just place and thinks progress toward that goal could immeasurably be helped by a bold leader articulating and pushing for big ideas at the top of the national and global political hierarchy			1
this @entity8 is wearing a skimpy bikini			1
@entity38 wants the world to be better too , but she 's all - too - aware of how progressive idealists are chewed up , spit out and drowned out by party politics			1
she is conscious that @entity42 was n't even that progressive and knows how much more centrist he became in the first six years of his presidency			2
this @entity8 is skeptical of how much politics can be changed from the inside as well as how much politics these days can change the world , especially given entrenched partisanship			1
she is wearing swim trunks , a long - sleeve uv protective t - shirt and two hats			2
@entity53 : @entity22 is like the @entity54 of @entity56 politics today -- she 's our only hope			1
there 's no one else speaking as sharply and powerfully about inequality and economic populism			1
[ she takes a sip of her piña colada			2
] @entity66 : i could n't agree more			2
which is exactly why we should n't waste @entity70 on a dead - end presidential campaign			2
[ she gulps her margarita			2
] @entity74 : first of all , you do n't know it 's a dead end			1
@entity42 was the underdog in 2008 and look what happened			2
plus , @entity70 is much more popular at this point now than he was then			0
@entity80 : yeah , but in the latest @entity1 @entity18 primary poll , @entity70 trails @entity27 by 52 points			1
@entity74 : those are national polls			0
primaries are run state - by - state			1
and in a different poll , @entity18 primary voters in @entity89 and in @entity90 favored @entity70 over @entity92 , so ...			0
@entity80 : in fairness , that poll was run by @entity70 backers			1
and anyway , nationwide 79 % of @entity18 have a favorable view of @entity92			0
just 37 % have a favorable view of @entity70			0
@entity74 : because 63 % do n't know her yet			0
that 's why she needs to run			1
@entity80 : but be honest , the path to her winning is hard to see			0
sure , @entity42 did it once , but do you really think the @entity92 machine will allow itself to be defeated twice ? @entity74 : ah , and that 's reason two why @entity70 should run -- because even if she ca n't win , she will help shape the political debate and push @entity27 to the left , especially around economic justice issues			1
@entity80 : maybe , but then in four or eight years when @entity70 would really have a shot at the presidency , she 'll be a @entity110 already - ran , not a bright shiny new candidate			0
@entity74 : all the more reason to run now			1
now is our nation 's moment , crawling out of the economic crisis , still riddled with unprecedented economic inequality , we do n't need @entity22 to be president in four years or eight years or 16			1
@entity80 : i agree that @entity70 is transformational and has the bold vision we need right now			0
and is n't that exactly why she should n't run ? national big money political campaigns are where good ideas go to die			1
@entity74 : maybe @entity22 can be the candidate to change all that , the candidate for the people , not the political process -- who even appeals to and unites independent and conservative voters who know the economy is ridiculously rigged for the rich and want government to stop aiding and abetting injustice			1
[ they both laugh uproariously at the suggestion that politics could ever be about people , not big money			0
] @entity80 : what i will say is that now is definitely the moment for a woman president ! and @entity27 's the one with the best shot			1
plus , for all her coziness with @entity146 and hawkish foreign policy , she 's still a bajillion times better than any of the @entity150 options			1
@entity152 , they have @entity153 for a few months and ca n't even govern themselves out of a paper bag			0
and if @entity27 might not do as much as we 'd like to fix economic inequality , let 's be clear -- republicans would just make it worse , like they did before			1
which is what really worries me about @entity70			0
there 's a reason they 're called " spoiler candidates			2
" i do n't want her to spoil the @entity18 ' chance to elect a woman this election			0
@entity74 : but no , that 's exactly why she has to run -- to make the party stronger , to make @entity27 less economically centrist and quick on the military trigger			1
we need a bold progressive candidate we can rally behind in the primaries			0
and if @entity70 wins , great			0
her vision also appeals to the broad majority of working people			0
and if she does n't win the primaries , still great -- we 've sent a clear message to @entity27 and forced her to be more populist			1
@entity80 : maybe ... or maybe @entity70 runs and wastes all her political capital , making too many compromises to be a viable candidate and losing her pedestal as an irreverent outsider and then being defeated anyway , so she 's diminished in some of the power and leverage she had before , too			2
she 's a great leader now , right now , as is			2
the magnifying glass of a national campaign could expose her imperfections or even burn her up in the sun. ... [ she reaches for the suntan lotion			0
] @entity74 : ... or it could magnify her reach and impact			0
[ she , too , reaches for the suntan lotion			0
] @entity80 : maybe we just see things too differently			0
[ they both stare down at their drinks and take another sip			0
] @entity80 : hey , my margarita is half - empty			0
@entity74 : oh , my piña colada is half - full			0
@entity80 : either way , we both need more , eh ?			0

the @entity24 and others have urged @entity22 to challenge @entity27 's likely candidacy
@entity8 : the idealist in me wants her to run ; the *pragmatist* thinks we should taker a safer route
