@entity1 tour groups and diplomats breeze past a nondescript display of 35 blown - up photos printed on poster board			1
suddenly , one tourist catches a glimpse of the subject of one of the photos : a man whose eyes have been gouged out			2
@entity13 , visiting the @entity1 from @entity14 , gasps when she realizes what she is looking at			1
" how could anybody do this ? " she said , while looking at the photos with a pained expression			2
" it 's not war			2
it 's not natural calamity			2
" the exhibit is tucked away behind the lobby of the @entity29			0
it 's a no - frills exhibition of photos taken by a man who is being called " @entity33 , " a @entity35 government defector whose job it was to take photos of dead detainees for the military police			1
@entity33 claimed to take up to 50 photos a day , and brought nearly 27,000 images like these out of the country			0
captions on the photos show that many of them were taken inside military hospitals , and accuse @entity35 president @entity51 's regime in the torture and killings			1
the photos show emaciated bodies			1
some have eyes gouged out , some have genitals removed			0
and many are covered with wounds , the flesh peeling from their bodies			0
it 's a sight that gave pause to @entity66 , who works at the @entity1 and was running late to a meeting			1
" i told myself i really wanted to come back here and take a proper look			0
it looks like something you have n't seen since the @entity74			0
it 's very bad , " @entity66 said			0
" it 's difficult to put a face , an image to the numbers we hear about			0
so you see these pictures ( and ) it sort of puts things in a new perspective			0
" while the photos have been shown before @entity87 and in media reports , many people , like @entity13 , had no idea they existed			0
that 's partly why @entity92 , senior political adviser to the @entity93 for a @entity94 @entity35 , said he placed the photos in this location			1
he wanted to bring awareness to the public and put pressure on @entity101 member states to vote for the @entity102 to prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity in @entity35			1
" if you ask anyone about @entity109 from @entity110 to @entity111 , everyone is so well aware of this obviously evil entity , " @entity92 said			0
" if you compare it to the horrendous crimes of the @entity51 regime , it does n't get , i feel , it does n't get the same coverage			1
" the @entity35 mission to the @entity1 did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the exhibit			1
the exhibit will be at the @entity1 until march 24 .			2

35 photos of tortured bodies are on display at the @entity1
adviser to the @entity93 for a @entity94 @entity35 says they show *actions* of president @entity51 's regime
