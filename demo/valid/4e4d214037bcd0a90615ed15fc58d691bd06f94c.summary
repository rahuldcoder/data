the campaign to retake the city of @entity2 from @entity3 , also known as the @entity4 , involves a curious mixture of @entity8 forces -- the army and air force , federal police , powerful @entity13 militia as well as @entity15 tribal fighters			1
it 's a cast of about 30,000 fighters with an opaque command structure			2
and that makes it tough to be precise about numbers -- but by several estimates only one - third of those fighters are from the regular army			2
a @entity5 team that 's seen the offensive at close quarters noted that @entity8 army commanders appeared to be taking a subordinate role to leaders of the @entity13 militia , notably @entity32 , leader of the @entity34			1
@entity36 military advisers are on hand , and highly influential on the battlefield			2
as @entity3 fighters in the area probably number in the low thousands , it might seem odd that the @entity8 army is unable to take them on alone			1
after all , the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) received $ 20 billion of @entity47 money between 2005 and 2012 -- for equipment , bases and training			1
so just why are the @entity45 incapable of reclaiming territory seized by @entity3 ? and how long will it be before they can stand on their own feet ? the answers go back to the @entity47 invasion of @entity8 in 2003 ; @entity8 's military is starting over -- for the second or third time in a decade			1
one of the most controversial acts of the @entity47 - led @entity58 , which ran @entity8 following the ouster of @entity60 , was to disband the @entity8 army			1
the decision , taken in may 2003 , " immediately created a large pool of unemployed and armed men who felt humiliated and hostile to the @entity47 occupiers , " as @entity64 put it in 2010			1
president @entity67 told his biographer @entity68 in 2006 : " the policy had been to keep the [ @entity8 ] army intact ; did n't happen			1
" the reasons have been disputed ever since			0
in some places there were riots among demobilized soldiers ; at the same time training of @entity8 police was a desperately slow process because of the rapidly growing insurgency			1
in 2004 , as in 2014 , the security forces buckled as a @entity15 insurgency spread through northern and western @entity8			1
billions of dollars were spent creating a new @entity8 army from scratch			1
but it took two years to build a force of just 40,000 men in three light infantry divisions , so unofficial sectarian militia filled the vacuum -- militia that never quite went away			2
over a seven - year period , more than $ 4 billion was spent on renovating and building @entity8 bases			1
logistical and maintenance support : $ 2.6 billion			1
supply of equipment : $ 3.4 billion ( in addition to what the @entity8 bought themselves			1
) training and staffing the @entity8 police : a cool $ 9.4 billion			1
with @entity47 assistance and the " @entity104 " program to coax @entity15 tribes into fighting @entity103 in @entity8 , violence did diminish in 2009 and 2010			1
but once @entity47 forces left at the end of 2011 , and with them intelligence - gathering and training programs , things began to unravel			1
by then , the @entity8 security forces in their many guises had become an unwieldy machine that was more a welfare program than a fighting force -- providing wages to soldiers who lacked motivation and were frequently absent from duty			1
the only effective units were special forces such as the @entity120			0
sophisticated @entity47 equipment , such as @entity123 battle tanks , was not maintained			1
corruption was rife -- and political interference in the military grew exponentially			1
as then prime minister @entity129 tightened his grip on power between 2006 and 2013 , the high command of the @entity8 military became a political football -- with loyalty to @entity129 prized above competence			1
he bypassed the defense and interior ministries and used elite units to pursue political enemies			0
the @entity139 reported in 2013 , " the lack of oversight on military appointments has allowed @entity129 to choose his preferred officers ( nearly all @entity13 ) to head the most significant command positions in @entity8			1
" @entity129 also began integrating @entity13 militia into army units			0
at the same time , the phenomenon of " ghost soldiers " went unchecked -- men who were either dead or @entity150 but whose wages were still being paid , often to corrupt commanders			1
so the army , in numbers , looked much stronger than it was			0
in fact , by the time @entity3 rolled south , the effective fighting force was less than a quarter of its peak strength of 400,000			2
nearly half the army -- four divisions -- collapsed in short order as @entity3 fighters stormed south from @entity164 in the early summer of 2014			2
@entity3 used speed , discipline and ruthlessness in equal measure -- attributes the @entity8 army did n't have			1
it had also cultivated allies among members of @entity15 tribes ready to act as a fifth column , and its fearsome reputation for wholesale executions of prisoners led many soldiers to strip off their uniforms and flee			0
the desperate situation in the summer of 2014 and an imminent threat to @entity13 shrines in @entity183 prompted a rapid mobilization of @entity13 militia that had already been active around the elections -- including the @entity34 and the @entity186			2
some members of these militia had gained combat experience fighting for the @entity191 regime in @entity164			0
in june , the most respected religious authority among @entity193 , grand ayatollah @entity194 , appealed to @entity8 to mobilize against the enemy			1
the call was directed at and answered by hundreds of thousands of @entity13 , determined to protect gains made since the overthrow of @entity60 's @entity200 regime			2
the militia -- called @entity202 or @entity203 ( @entity203 ) -- were trained , equipped and most importantly led by @entity36 military advisers and quickly became battle hardened			2
what they lacked in military skills , they made up for in determination			2
the @entity36 have invested heavily in the @entity211			0
the commander of @entity36 's @entity213 , gen. @entity214 , seems to have spent more time in @entity8 than @entity36 since last summer and has been photographed around @entity2			1
according to several analysts , it is @entity214 that has been organizing and directing the @entity13 militia in what appears to have been a more deliberate and better planned assault than previous operations			0
@entity222 of the @entity139 says the role of both the @entity36 and the @entity13 militia are evidence of the enduring weakness of the @entity45			2
and he says that " if the @entity2 operation is successful it presents a lot of problems for the @entity8 government 's legitimacy -- somewhere down the road the @entity36 and the @entity203 are going to demand payback			1
" the role of @entity236 -- a foreign terrorist organization in @entity239 's view -- means that @entity47 airpower has not been made available			1
" the @entity47 may not like @entity36 influence in @entity8 , " says @entity222 , " but what it absolutely can not do is provide direct support to an @entity36 - led military operation			1
" the chairman of the @entity246 , gen. @entity245 , alluded to the dilemma when in @entity248 on monday			0
" what i 'm trying to sort out , actually , is the degree to which their near - term embrace of the assistance they 're receiving from @entity36 is a reaction to the existential threat [ posed by @entity3 ] , or whether it is something longer - term , " he said			0
soon after taking office , @entity8 prime minister @entity258 fired 26 commanders and pushed 10 others into retirement			2
at the time a statement on his website stressed " the need to restore confidence in the security forces through real action and by combating corruption at the individual and institutional levels			0
" @entity47 - led efforts to train a new @entity8 army designed to defeat @entity3 are well underway			1
the aim is to stand up 12 brigades each of about 5,000 troops -- including three brigades of @entity278 peshmerga			0
these should be ready for operations by the end of this year ; the first brigade has already completed basic training			0
but as @entity222 notes , " the @entity45 are yet to go head - to - head with @entity3 and win without help from the @entity211			2
@entity3 is demonstrably more capable than the @entity45			2
" @entity3 from well - entrenched defenses around @entity287 , @entity8 's second largest city , seems well beyond the army 's capability			1
in november , gen. @entity245 said that roughly 80,000 effective troops would be needed in any attempt to win the city			0
that 's problematic for several reasons			0
@entity278 officials told @entity5 last month that the longer the battle for @entity287 is delayed , the tougher it will be			0
they claim that they can not maintain the siege of the city on three sides indefinitely			0
the @entity8 government is under political pressure to reclaim the city and re-establish its authority there			2
but above all , the need for @entity13 militia outside the direct control of the government to help retake largely @entity15 cities is fraught with peril			0
@entity310 has already cataloged incidents of sectarian retaliation against @entity15 communities by the militia			0
@entity2 is an especially sensitive area : in june last year , @entity3 massacred by its own account as many as 1,600 air force cadets , the vast majority @entity13 , at @entity318			0
some families of the murdered recruits , and a few survivors , have claimed local @entity15 tribes may have helped @entity3 or even handed over the recruits after promising them safe passage			0
@entity310 @entity326 deputy director @entity325 says that " past fighting raises grave concerns that @entity2 's civilians are at serious risk from both @entity3 and government forces , and both sides need to protect civilians from more sectarian slaughter			0
" tit - for - tat atrocities are fuelled by a stream of social media videos showing abuses committed by all sides			0
@entity3 ' use of children : propaganda and military training during the @entity2 operation , both prime minister @entity258 and @entity345 of the @entity34 have publicly called for civilians to be spared and human rights to be respected			0
only when the city is taken , will we know whether their appeals were heeded			0
@entity222 says he believes a majority of @entity8 want to see their country survive ; far fewer want a return to sectarian conflict akin to civil war			2
but it remains a possibility			0
one of the greatest challenges -- politically -- will be to absorb the @entity13 militia and @entity15 tribal brigades into the @entity45 , rather than have them operate as independent armies			1
they are meant to constitute a new @entity367 , but the mechanics and timing remain problematic			0
the leaders of these militia have tasted power ; their men have shed blood			0
they are not going to just hand over the reins -- even if and when isis are beaten			0
and they wo n't have to fear a strong army for a long time to come			0
@entity5 's @entity378 and @entity379 contributed to this story .			0

@entity8 @entity45 ( @entity382 ) received $ 20 billion of @entity47 money between 2005 and 2012
