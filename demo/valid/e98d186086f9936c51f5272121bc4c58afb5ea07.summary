growing up in @entity1 , everything @entity3 der @entity2 learned about @entity5 came from the books of 19th - century @entity1 writer @entity7			1
may 's most beloved characters , a noble @entity10 leader named @entity11 and his cowboy blood brother @entity13 , are said to be more popular today in @entity1 than the works of @entity15 , the 20th - century @entity16 - winning author of " @entity17			1
" it was n't until von der @entity2 drove through @entity20 last year , bearing witness to modest homes and trailers on tribal land in the majestic @entity25 , that he realized how one - dimensional his perceptions were			1
intrigued , the 25 - year - old photographer began researching native american history			1
what he learned about its brutal conquest and fraught modern existence inspired him to return to @entity33 to capture the good , the bad and the ugly			1
" i wanted to show a slice of life ( through ) the beauty and richness of the culture , " he said			1
" i did n't want to do reportage			2
i wanted to do slow and thoughtful photographs , like historical documents			2
" by chance he landed in @entity44 's @entity43 , home to 7,000 members of the @entity46 ( @entity47 ) and the @entity48 ( @entity49 ) tribes on 675,147 acres of land near the @entity53 border			1

social media follow @ @entity86 on @entity87 to join the conversation about photography			0
he captured sacred tribal rituals and ceremonies along with the more mundane , familiar aspects of life : the tribal basketball team , a horse grazing in a field , a girl sitting on a bunk bed with a stuffed pony , the inside of a casino			0
through conversations with tribal members , he also learned of the harsh realities of life on the reservation , from the difficulties youths face in pursuing educational opportunities to the drug and alcohol addiction killing some members			2
he put the camera away for some of his most memorable experiences -- a sit in the sweat lodge , dinner with his host family -- the ones that formed lasting relationships and earned him the nickname " the man who crossed the ocean			0
" by revealing just a slice , he hopes to arouse curiosity in viewers and inspire them to learn more " to connect the dots			1
" it 's something he plans to continue doing by returning this summer to learn and experience more			0
