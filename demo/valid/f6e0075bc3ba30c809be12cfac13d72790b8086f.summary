@entity0 and the city " have agreed to a mutual separation , " @entity7 officials announced			1
" it 's a really hard pill to swallow , " @entity0 said in a text message responding to @entity2 's request for comment			1
he also confirmed his resignation in a letter to @entity7 's mayor			1
" it is with profound sadness that i am announcing i am stepping down from my position as chief of police for the city of @entity7 , @entity23 , " @entity0 said , adding that serving the city as police chief " has been an honor and a privilege			1
" the resignation will go into effect march 19 , @entity0 said , to " provide for an orderly transition of command			1

@entity0 will receive a severance payment and health insurance for one year , the city said , with lt. col. @entity41 assuming his duties during a nationwide search for a new chief			1
@entity7 mayor @entity45 said he could n't go into details about the personnel discussions behind the decision to give @entity0 a year of severance pay			1
" i think it 's fair to say that in many executive level private industries , you would get a similar treatment , " he said			2
@entity45 said the police chief decided to resign " after a lot of soul searching			1
" " i think it 's important that we recognize that the chief made this decision because he wanted to do this , " @entity45 said			1
" he thought it was the best for the city and the @entity65			2
" hours after the announcement , protesters gathered outside the @entity68			1

at least two people were arrested , @entity2 affiliate @entity73 said , but it was not immediately clear why			0
as of late wednesday night , the protest was largely peaceful			0
@entity0 's resignation is the latest fallout from the @entity4 report , which exposed problems in the city 's policing tactics and faulted @entity7 's officers for seeing residents as " sources of revenue , " a practice that federal investigators said disproportionately targeted african - americans			1
the investigators also found evidence of racist jokes being sent around by @entity7 police and court officials			2
@entity95 manager @entity94 stepped down tuesday			0
the report mentions both men by name			0

last week , @entity0 declined to comment on details in the report			1
" i need to have time to really analyze this report so i can comment on it , " @entity0 told @entity2 thursday			1
when asked what he planned to do about the report 's findings , the chief said he would " take action as necessary			2
" after his resignation wednesday , he said in a written statement to @entity2 's @entity117 that he was encouraged by the report 's conclusion , which says that @entity7 " has the capacity to reform its approach to law enforcement			2
" " we agree that @entity7 can do the tough work to see this through and emerge the best small town it can be , " he said			0
@entity45 told reporters wednesday that the city is still analyzing the report			2
" we continue to go through that report and talk about where the breakdown was , " he said			0
" the chief , being an honorable man , decided we needed to talk about the way moving forward was with someone else			2
" city officials , he said , still believe the @entity65 can be reformed without being eliminated			0
" the city of @entity7 looks to become an example of how a community can move forward in the face of adversity , " the mayor said			0
" we are committed to keeping our @entity65 and having one that exhibits the highest degree of professionalism and fairness			0
" when @entity0 became @entity7 's police chief in 2010 , it was supposed to be a relatively easy way to cap his career in law enforcement			1
after some 30 years with the @entity162 , serving as commander of a drug task force and @entity159 supervisor , being a police chief of a smaller department should have been less stressful			1
the shooting of @entity164 last year changed everything			0
@entity164 , an @entity167 - @entity166 teen , was unarmed when he was shot by a white @entity7 police officer			0
the incident exposed feelings of distrust between @entity7 's black community and its police department , which is overwhelmingly white			2
@entity174 , the officer who shot @entity164 , wo n't face any criminal charges for the shooting			0
in november , a grand jury decided not to indict him			0
last week the @entity4 said @entity174 's actions " do not constitute prosecutable violations " of federal civil rights law			0
he resigned from the department in november , citing security concerns			0
but that has n't stopped criticism of the department from local residents and top federal officials			0
even before the @entity4 report was finished , @entity166 attorney general @entity188 said it was " pretty clear that the need for wholesale change in that department is appropriate			0
" critics have accused @entity0 of inflaming tensions in the @entity162 suburb with his response to the shooting			2
over the past six months , @entity0 has defended his officers and vowed to work with the community			2
" i intend to see this thing through			0
and i 've been working with a lot of community members to work on some progressive changes that will bring the community together and to open up dialogue and getting us all talking about serious issues and actually creating solutions to problems , " he told @entity2 in november			0
