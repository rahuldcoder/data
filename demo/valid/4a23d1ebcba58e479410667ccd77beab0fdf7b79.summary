@entity1 motorists in @entity3 have taken to snatching the car keys of foreign drivers amid rising concern over dangerous driving by tourists			1
@entity3 media have reported five cases this year of locals forcibly taking the keys of foreign motorists after witnessing driving that concerned them			1
all the incidents -- which have been condemned by authorities -- took place in the @entity19 , which draws tourists from around the world for its rugged scenery , including lakes and mountains featured in director @entity26 's " @entity25 " films			2
the incidents occurred amid heightened public concern over tourist driving standards , with eight people killed in crashes involving foreign drivers in the space of a fortnight last month			1
among the dead were a family of four from @entity37 who were killed when their car crossed the center line and collided with a logging truck			2
the key snatchings have even prompted prime minister @entity43 to weigh in on the issue , advising that " people taking the law into their own hands is not sensible			0
" @entity48 assistant commissioner of road policing @entity49 said the confiscations existed in a legal gray area , as there was no explicit statute dealing with the issue			2
although there might be exceptional circumstances where taking someone 's keys could be legally justified , such as preventing drunken driving , he said , " in the vast majority of cases , it wo n't be			2
" " that extends to physically assaulting or abusing someone in response to their driving , which is simply not acceptable , and anyone found doing so should expect to face the consequences , " he said			2
diesel mechanic @entity71 of @entity72 made headlines last month after he took the keys of a @entity76 couple who had stopped their car on a narrow single - lane road to take pictures , causing a backlog of vehicles behind them			2
" i was coming into town with my wife and son and came around the corner , and there was a car stopped in the @entity90 , " he told @entity2 affiliate @entity83			0
he called police and took their keys as " a safety thing , you know , timeframe for police to get there , " he said			0
the @entity97 later revealed that @entity71 was driving on an expired license himself			0
@entity71 told local media it was not the first time he had taken a tourist 's car keys			1
only 6 % of crashes in @entity3 involve foreign drivers , according to the latest figures provided by the @entity107			1
but in some remote regions of the @entity19 particularly popular with tourists for their scenery -- such as the @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity115 districts -- foreign drivers are involved in about a quarter of all crashes			1
in @entity118 , on the @entity19 's rugged @entity117 , foreign drivers are involved in 37 % of road crashes resulting in death or injury			1
@entity122 , mayor of the neighboring @entity123 , said tourist driving behavior was a major problem in the region and attributed the issue to tourists from countries that drive on the right			1
@entity3 drive on the left			0
" there 's a huge number of tourists coming through to these destinations because of the scenery , but the scenery is a problem , " he said			0
" there 's so many beautiful sights to see that they 're not concentrating on their driving			0
once they lose their concentration , they tend to fall into old habits and drive on the right			0
even for 20 seconds , it can cause damage			0
" a @entity107 spokesperson said that while this was a factor , figures showed that @entity154 and @entity155 drivers were involved in the most crashes overall , " so unfamiliarity with which side of the road to drive on is not the only factor			1
" @entity122 said that he had seen three cases of tourists driving on the wrong side of the road recently but that the vigilante approach -- which had seen a visitor to his town punched in the face as he was stripped of his keys last month -- was " disgraceful			2
" he said the best approach was better education on local driving conditions for foreign drivers , particularly at the rental companies where they picked up their vehicles			1
anyone with a foreign drivers license or permit is able to drive in @entity3 for up to a year			1
associate transport minister @entity179 said the government recognized that " many people are concerned with poor driving behavior on challenging roads in and around popular tourist destinations " and had established a project in response			1
the measures include improvements to roading , such as " keep left " signage and no - passing markings on the extensive stretches of single - lane highway , and educational resources targeted at visiting drivers , including many targeting the growing @entity76 market			0
@entity122 said it was important to " strike the right balance " in getting the message to foreign drivers to take care on the unfamiliar roads			1
" we value tourism and the dollars it brings to @entity3 , especially to our region here			0
we do n't want to put tourists off , but we want them to be safe in our country , " he said			0
" you cross that center line , and anything 's possible			0
" @entity2 's @entity212 contributed to this report .			0
