i met @entity2 in january 2010 in a nondescript classroom at @entity4 in @entity5			1
she arrived for class beaming with excitement about the journey she was about to begin -- participation in a yearlong academic theology program sponsored jointly by four @entity5 seminaries			2
since she has been sentenced to the death penalty and lives in solitary confinement , @entity2 was particularly eager to share community with others , if only one morning a week			1
and she was grateful for the opportunity to explore the @entity18 and theology in a rigorous manner that would nurture and deepen her devotional life			2
that image of her on the first day of class remains vivid to me because it captures the core of who @entity2 is â€” who she has become : someone full of contagious joy and gratitude , open to others and to new experiences for growth and ministry			1
@entity2 's process of transformation began shortly after she arrived in prison following her conviction for murder in the death of her husband , @entity41			1
a pastor began visiting her and initiated a series of difficult , yet compassionate , conversations that urged her toward courageous self - reflection			0
this same pastor has been visiting @entity2 for almost 16 years			1
her commitment to @entity2 , along with that of the prison chaplain and chaplaincy interns , provided steady , ongoing love that fostered change			1
so by the time i met @entity2 in 2010 she had already undergone a significant transformation			1
she was , in the words of the @entity59 , a " new creation " ( 2 cor. 5:17 )			0
in the theology program , @entity2 found her own voice and came to see that her reflections on @entity65 faith could be a gift to the wider church " on the outside , " as well as in prison			1
by studying historical and contemporary christian thinkers , @entity2 became part of the conversations that make the @entity65 tradition dynamic			1
she asked honest questions about her relationship to @entity76 , others and the world			0
she read scripture and grappled with centuries - old theological questions			0
she discovered her authentic theological voice in the midst of this work			2
" from the start of the theology class i felt this hunger , " she said in her 2011 graduation speech			2
" i became so hungry for theology , and what all the classes had to offer ; you could call me a glutton			2
" one of the great joys of being a theology professor is getting to know students holistically , not only as thinkers , but also as human beings wrestling with some of life 's most urgent questions			2
my relationship with @entity2 had this quality from the start			1
but it deepened six months into the year when a new warden arrived at the prison			0
in her graduation speech , @entity2 described this moment : " there came a time when ... my worst fears became my reality -- i was pulled from the courses			1
i was taken from my theological community			0
being pulled from the program devastated me as badly as if someone had just told me one of my appeals had been turned down			0
" since i could n't go to the theology class ... the instructors came to me			2
still , this was far from being ideal because now i had to have class and community through a gate			0
it was hard ... but i pushed on			0
i pushed on because of that hunger			0
that gate ... was meant to keep everyone and everything separated from me			0
but that gate could n't keep out the knowledge that i was so hungry for , nor friendship and community			0
and it sure could n't keep out @entity76			0
" this change afforded us the chance to have two hours of one - on - one conversation every friday			0
we continued to read theological texts together , including a book by then - archbishop of canterbury @entity138			0
@entity138 describes healing and restoration as the act of facing our painful memories , " the ruins of the past , " and building from them here and now			0
restoration , @entity138 writes , " is going back to the memories of the painful , humiliating past and bringing them to redemption in the present ... to @entity152 [ who ] comes to repair the devastation			0
" i sat with @entity2 as she went back over some of her own painful memories , took responsibility for them and showed profound remorse about who she had been and what she had done			1
indeed , the power of these moments -- when @entity2 looked me in the eye and confessed concrete sins , when we spoke of @entity76 's love and forgiveness -- will stay with me forever			1
@entity2 embraced what @entity170 , a @entity171 pastor - theologian and @entity173 resister , calls " costly grace			1
" for @entity170 , " cheap grace " is seeking @entity76 's forgiveness as a " cover - up for one 's sins , for which one has no remorse and ... even less desire to be set free			0
" in contrast , costly grace requires rigorously following @entity185 in a way that leads to continuous , visible transformation , what the @entity188 calls the fruits of redemption			0
the fruits of @entity2 's redemption are now well - documented : reconciliation with her children , ministry to inmates full of despair , counsel to troubled youth and daily concern for others			1
on the night @entity2 thought would be her last , she spent the evening writing a letter to her fellow inmates , urging them not to worry about her , but to be encouraged			1
most poignant for @entity2 are the writings of @entity171 theologian @entity207 , who is widely known as the " theologian of hope " and with whom @entity2 began corresponding in 2010			1
@entity207 shows that biblical hope is not a hope that gives up on this life and looks for something better beyond the grave			2
rather , hope makes manifest the kingdom of @entity76 now -- @entity76 's intended social order " on earth as it is in heaven " ( @entity219 6:10 )			2
biblical hope " revolutionizes and transforms the present			2
" it is the hope of the psalmist who " looks for the goodness of @entity76 in this life " ( @entity229 27:13 )			2
in the words of @entity2 's favorite scripture , it is a hope that proclaims : " i shall not die but live , and declare the works of the lord " ( @entity229 118:17 )			1
in @entity2 's own words : " the theology program has shown me that hope is still alive and that , despite a gate or a guillotine hovering over my head , i still possess the ability to prove that i am human			1
labels on anyone can be notoriously misleading and unforgiving things			0
but no matter the label attached to me , i have the capacity and the unstoppable desire to accomplish something positive and have a lasting impact ... even prison can not erase my hope or conviction that the future is not settled for me , or anyone			0
" many people have asked me in recent days how i have been transformed by my friendship with @entity2 and by @entity2 's journey of hope			1
while i struggle to find adequate words , what i do know is that @entity2 's story pushes the logic of @entity65 faith to its outermost limits			1
it pushes @entity268 to reexamine and reaffirm the truths we proclaim about repentance , forgiveness , redemption and hope			0
indeed , even professional theologians and life - long pastors struggle with the weight of the claims we make			0
today , @entity2 's life hangs in the balance			1
the state of @entity283 on monday issued a last - minute postponement of her execution , citing concerns about the drugs that were to be used to kill her			1
the @entity288 has said that it plans to resume executions once an analysis of the drugs is complete			0
while gov. @entity293 does not have the formal power to commute @entity2 's sentence to life in prison , i join more than 1,100 faith leaders from across the nation , including more than 500 from @entity283 , who have signed a letter urging the governor to use his political influence to save @entity2 's life and to speak out publicly against her execution			1
i call on all people of good will to reach out to @entity305 and to @entity283 state legislators to demand a more just , merciful , and accountable system of justice -- for @entity2 and for all			2
as theologian @entity315 wrote , " if the life even of a convicted murderer can be turned around and so radically redirected , then none of us is without hope			0
" we need to hear @entity2 proclaim to us -- as much as we proclaim to her -- that the promises of @entity76 are real .			2

the execution of @entity2 was postponed *due* to concerns over *injection* drugs
@entity322 : in her time on death row , @entity2 has discovered hope through theology
