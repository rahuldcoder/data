thirty years ago , a journey across @entity1 meant a passport full of stamps , a wallet full of different currencies and plenty of time spent waiting in line to be glared at by border officials			1
that all began to change in june 1985 , when the continent 's countries began signing up to the @entity15 agreement -- a deal that lifted frontier controls between cooperating neighbors			1
today , 20 years after it came into force , with more than 26 states now participating , @entity15 has completely altered the experience of traversing @entity1			1
nowhere is this more visible than at the old crossing points -- places that were once hives of activity but are now ghostly , vacated shells of their former selves			0
@entity30 photographer @entity29 spent several years criss - crossing the continent to capture these abandoned checkpoints on camera for a project he calls " after @entity15			1
" the result is a fascinating gallery of images that charts the unusual architecture of places whose fate has been intertwined with @entity1 's ever - evolving political and economic allegiances			1
" i do n't know why but from many years ago , i feel very attracted to situations or places where the natural and the artificial come together , sometimes a little bit in conflict , " @entity29 tells @entity2 , explaining his interest in frontiers			1
he says he spent his formative years poring over the @entity50 , marveling at the straight - line borders carved by colonialists across the map of @entity54 and wondering why @entity1 could n't iron the kinks out of their own squiggled frontiers			2
" when you are a young child in front of a map you feel ... you have the whole world in front of you and you can travel with your mind of course , with your imagination , " he says			0
as a young adult in the early 1990s , @entity29 experienced many of these borders firsthand when he embarked on an @entity69 trip -- a country - hopping rite of passage that sees many young @entity1 take advantage of cheap pan-continental train tickets			1
" before , when i was young , if you traveled from @entity30 to @entity74 you had to cross three countries and take three currencies , " he recalls			2
" once i was traveling with my friend , interailing ... from @entity79 to @entity80 , we had to cross the old @entity81			0
" i think into the night , 2 or 3 a.m. , we cross the border from @entity79 into @entity81 and the train stopped			2
we were sleeping , of course			0
then three or four soldiers come into the train and shouted at everybody , very aggressively , like in a spy movie			0
" we waited half an hour , then half an hour later the train went on			0
it was exciting , even funny as i was 18 years old , but now it 's not so funny			2
" as @entity29 points out , in a @entity1 cleaved by the @entity93 , many borders were not just the cultural dividing lines they are today			2
back then they were fortifications demarcating places of oppression and freedom			0
the checkpoints themselves were sometimes places of fear , of hostile bureaucracy -- a past @entity29 says lingers on in the buildings left behind			2
" for me it 's fascinating because you can see the passage of the time , the human footprint			2
" these places had a very strong coercive role , people had to stop the car and the policeman had to ask you who you are , you showed your passport , maybe you had to open your bags			0
the police had the power to not let you go on			0
" it 's interesting to me , looking at these places now they are a little bit spooky , because at most of them you can feel this ghostly atmosphere			0
" the frontier buildings range in size and style , from giant @entity129 declarations of authority that loom over major highways to tiny huts in deep , dark forests			1
@entity1 's richer countries tend to maintain old posts , while less wealthier states seem content to let them deteriorate , @entity29 says			1
some , he says , are gone completely , marked only on maps and located using gps trackers or by talking to locals			0
a strong supporter for an open @entity1 at a time when some of the continent 's nations are talking about severing the close economic and political bonds they share with their neighbors , @entity29 recalls one encounter that underscored the human side to his project			1
while setting up his camera at a checkpoint on the @entity154 frontier , he watched as a man drove in from the @entity157 side and parked , followed by a woman , two minutes later , from the @entity160 side			0
" they began to speak and they were kissing very much			0
after 10 minutes they went back their separate ways , and i thought , before the @entity15 agreement , this couple had no future			1
" follow @entity29 's ongoing project at @entity169			1
