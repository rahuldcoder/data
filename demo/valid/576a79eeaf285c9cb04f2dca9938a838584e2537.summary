@entity0 @entity2 is pressing the reset button -- yet again			1
she 's quietly fighting back a week after her awkward and occasionally combative news conference on the furor over the private email server she used while running the @entity7			1
@entity10 's @entity9 account is buzzing this week with posts that test political messages on health care , college affordability , civil rights and jobs -- issues she hopes will help mobilize president @entity21 's @entity20 coalition and pave her way to the presidency			1
meanwhile , her nascent operation is leaking details of future staffers in an unmistakeable message to @entity20 spooked by the email flap that the campaign - in - waiting will become an official effort , possibly as soon as next month			0
a @entity1 / @entity31 out on wednesday found that she 's miles ahead of any potential @entity20 challenger and would beat all potential @entity34 candidates by at least 10 points			0
despite fretting among some democrats who worried that the party 's best -- and perhaps only -- viable @entity20 candidate appeared to be in trouble , early signs suggest @entity10 is doing what the @entity42 do best : mounting a comeback			1
" the interest in the story is collapsing onto itself			0
i do n't see an organic clamoring for more information , " said a longtime @entity10 ally who did n't want to speak for a campaign that has n't yet been announced			1
this person , who has spent time in @entity53 , argued that outside the community of political reporters and consultants in @entity0 and @entity58 who fixated on the story , the people who really count -- voters -- were n't really interested			0
" people very much want to know what the campaign is going to be about ... what is she going to do about student loan costs , for example ? " @entity67 , a @entity20 strategist who was @entity68 regional director of @entity21 's re-election campaign in 2012 , agreed			0
" if and when @entity2 decides to run , she will have to address this issue , but i believe the @entity73 people are more interested in her addressing the kitchen table issues that matter most to them , " he said			1
of course , @entity10 still faces plenty of challenges and the email saga raised questions about whether she can run a more sophisticated , no drama campaign than the one she managed in 2008			1
but the @entity1 poll revealed that those critical of @entity10 's role in the email affair appear to break close to party lines and her favorable rating remains at 53 %			1
a slow recent decline in that rating appears to coincide with @entity10 's slow re-entry into partisan politics and does not necessarily reflect her recent stumbles			1
perhaps the most intriguing figure in the poll is that only 1 % of respondents had never heard of @entity10			1
that supports the idea expressed by some @entity20 that @entity10 may be the most vetted figure in public life			1
there are people who will never vote for her and those who are dedicated to her quest to be the first female president , but very few whose minds may not be made up			0
a less well - known candidate might have made a terrible first impression if faced with the kind of hyper - covered flap @entity10 was			1
but @entity34 believe the email scandal could be a political gift that keeps on giving , as it touches on a narrative that the @entity42 are secretive , resistant to transparency and often blur the rules			1
there are also other problems -- including the question of foreign funds sent to the @entity123 and @entity2 's whopper speaking fees -- that @entity34 believe could reach a political mass and fan doubts about the likely @entity20 nominee 's character			1
then there are the foreign policy questions , including a now damaging photo op in which @entity10 offered a " reset " button to @entity135 only for the country to revert to a @entity138 posture			1
she was also a central player in @entity21 's foreign policy , which often appears to be overtaken by the @entity142 's swift descent into chaos			0
" for everything that i can see , the @entity20 have put all of their eggs in one basket here , " said @entity144 , communications director of the @entity145			0
" that is more of a downfall in the general election than in the primary			0
" @entity144 argued that even with younger voters , who do not remember the @entity10 years , the question of impropriety over her emails could provide an entry point into past scandals			1
though @entity10 is the prohibitive @entity20 front - runner , her support in the party is not universal			1
but where she faces resistance , it is more likely to be over policy than emails , as grass - roots democrats are suspicious over her centrist , pro-business and hawkish foreign policy leanings			0
" as this discussion was playing out inside the @entity184 , our members were focused on issues , " said @entity176 , executive director of @entity177 , which wants @entity179 to challenge @entity10 for the @entity20 nomination			2
@entity176 said activists were preoccupied with the preservation of the social safety net , constraining @entity189 and those on the " ragged edge " of the middle class			0
similarly , the young voters who flocked to @entity21 in 2008 and who will be crucial to @entity10 's hopes of mobilizing an effective @entity20 coalition in 2016 may also offer @entity10 a political cushion			2
this group is hazy over historic references to long ago @entity10 scandals like @entity201 , @entity202 and even the @entity204 episode that led to president @entity10 's impeachment			2
" the media loves a @entity10 scandal , " said one @entity20 source who did n't want to be named because he does n't work for @entity10			2
" but young people are more likely to know her as secretary of state , and someone who ran for president in 2008			0
" @entity214 bears out the theory			0
the @entity1 survey shows @entity10 's favorability among voters age 18 to 34 with a 22 point positive differential			2
but she 's barely in positive territory among voters age 50 to 64 , who are likely to have strong memories of her time as first lady , and is underwater among those 60 or older			0
another well - connected @entity228 who did n't want to go on the record criticizing @entity10 admitted that the email issue did play into @entity34 caricatures about the allegedly " conspiratorial " politicians and that it could challenge the former secretary of state 's early efforts to get her message out about her ideas and rationale for running for president			1
but @entity20 operatives think that once @entity10 is actually running , with an infrastructure behind her , and striking messages about the minimum wage , college debt and middle - class economic issues , voters will engage			2
in many ways , the email furor was a story the media could n't wait to write , so it may be that journalists have inflated the importance of the episode , at least in the absence of any evidence that @entity10 broke the law or made classified information vulnerable			1
political reporters have pined for weeks for @entity10 to swing her campaign into action , and her failure to offer a storyline opened a vacuum that was easy for unflattering stories to fill			2
her slow response breathed new life into a question that only @entity10 can answer : will her 2016 campaign be as dysfunctional , reactive and distracted as her chaotic and unsuccessful 2008 effort ? but there were a few lessons			2
it 's clear the @entity10 machine is not about to morph into a humming , scandal - free effort in the image of @entity21 's first presidential campaign			2
and @entity10 's bitter relationship with political reporters seems as bad as ever			0
the days when she partied with a @entity7 press corps more preoccupied with policy than politics seem like ancient history			0
but here also , @entity10 is trying a reset			0
her nascent campaign has made it known that she is staffing up her campaign and press operation			0
@entity294 , who is expected to take a leadership role in her campaign , is respected by reporters , as is @entity299 , the outgoing @entity300 communications director expected to take on a similar role for @entity10			0
on tuesday , it emerged that @entity10 would name @entity303 , who has also good ties with reporters , to be lead press secretary .			0
