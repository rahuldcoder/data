@entity1 house speaker @entity0 said @entity4 sgt. @entity3 is " innocent until proven guilty " after the @entity6 military charged him with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy , but emphasized in an exclusive interview with @entity2 's @entity11 that he was more concerned about the circumstances of his release			1
@entity3 's attorney also released a statement on wednesday , outlining his defense of the soldier and containing a two - page letter from @entity3 describing the torture he endured , which included months spent chained to a bed and further years spent chained on all fours or locked in a cage			1
shortly after the charges were announced , @entity3 's attorneys released a lengthy statement that includes a letter sent to @entity27 earlier this month outlining their defense of the soldier			1
" in light of the nearly five years of harsh captivity sgt. @entity3 endured , the purpose of his leaving his unit , and his behavior while a prisoner , it would be unduly harsh to impose on him the lifetime stigma of a court - martial conviction or an other than honorable discharge and to deny him veterans benefits , " attorney @entity30 writes in the letter			1
the statement includes a two - page accounting from @entity3 of his time in captivity , in which he recounts months spent chained to a bed , then further years spent chained on all fours or locked in a cage			1
read the statement and @entity3 's letter @entity3 said for years his body and health declined due to malnourishment , and sores on his wrists and ankles from the shackles grew infected			1
" my body started a steady decline in constant internal sickness that would last through the final year , " he said			0
@entity3 was frequently beaten , at times with copper wire or a thick rubber hose , and forced to watch @entity67 videos , he said			1
he had no concept of time , and was repeatedly told he would be killed and would never again see his family			0
" i was kept in constant isolation during the entire five years , with little to no understanding of time , through periods of constant darkness , periods of constant light , and periods of completely random flickering of light and absolutely no understanding of anything that was happening beyond the door i was held behind , " he wrote			0
@entity3 tried a dozen times to escape , he wrote			2
in his interview with @entity86 , @entity0 said " like any @entity6 , you 're innocent until proven guilty			0
" " and these charges are coming			0
there will be a trial , " @entity0 said in an interview taped wednesday to air sunday on @entity2 's " @entity90			0
" @entity0 said the " more troubling part " of @entity3 saga is the fact that the @entity6 government traded five @entity67 fighters for @entity3 's release , and that recent reports indicate one has returned to the battlefield			1
he expressed concerns about other detainees held at the @entity6 military prison at @entity104 , which president @entity105 is working to close , " ending up back on the battlefield and threatening @entity6 here and abroad			0
" @entity105 " violated the law " in failing to alert @entity109 before the prisoner swap occurred , @entity0 added			1
" and i still believe that 's the more troubling part of this , " he said			0
" we 've made clear in the past that we wo n't negotiate with terrorists , and but yet here we did			0
" military officials announced wednesday afternoon they would charge @entity3 with one count each of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy			2
@entity3 left his post in @entity122 before being captured and held captive for five years			2
for that , he faces charges that carry a maximum penalty of life in a military prison , and he could also have to forfeit pay and be stripped of his rank , @entity4 col. @entity123 said as he announced the charges			0
@entity3 faces a military procedure similar to a grand jury that will whether charges are appropriate , @entity123 said			2
then , he could face court martial proceedings			0
the decision comes nearly a year after @entity3 returned to the @entity6 as part of a prisoner exchange and since the @entity4 began a formal investigation into his disappearance from his unit in eastern @entity122 in june 2009			1
the @entity4 concluded its investigation into the circumstances of @entity3 's capture in december			1
until now , it has been in the hands of gen. @entity27 , head of @entity146 , who made the decision to charge @entity3			2
several @entity6 military officials @entity2 has spoken with suggested privately that the process took longer than expected			0
ahead of wednesday 's announcement , officials said @entity27 only had a few choices			0
though the sense had been that @entity3 must be held accountable for his actions , there had been little appetite for a lengthy term in military confinement given the five years @entity3 was held by the @entity67			2
now 28 , @entity3 was taken by the @entity160 terrorist network			2
but the circumstances of @entity3 's departure from his base and how willingly he left have not been clear			1
@entity123 said he could n't offer those details on wednesday , and that they 're being treated as evidence for the upcoming proceedings against @entity3			2
@entity168 chairman @entity167 , @entity169 , called the charges an " important step " on wednesday			0
" this is an important step in the military justice process towards determining the accountability of sgt. @entity3 , " he said in a statement			2
" i am confident that the @entity177 will continue to ensure this process is conducted with the utmost integrity under the @entity180			0
" sen. @entity181 , @entity183 - @entity182 , meanwhile , lambasted the " unevenness " of @entity105 's swap of five @entity67 prisoners for @entity3			1
" i would n't have done this trade for a @entity189 winner , " he told @entity2			0
" no military member should expect their country to turn over five @entity67 commanders to get their release			0
it 's not the nature of his service that drives my thinking it 's just the illogical nature of the swap			2
" some members of @entity3 's platoon have criticized him , labeling @entity3 a deserter			1
" i was pissed off then , and i am even more so now with everything going on , " former sgt. @entity205 , a member of @entity3 's platoon when he went missing on june 30 , 2009 , told @entity2 last year			1
" @entity3 deserted during a time of war , and his fellow @entity6 lost their lives searching for him			1
" @entity3 was freed in may when president @entity105 agreed to swap five @entity67 prisoners who had been detained in @entity104 to secure @entity3 's freedom , sending those detainees to @entity214			1
@entity105 announced @entity3 's release to fanfare in the @entity217 , flanked by the @entity4 sergeant 's parents , @entity220 and @entity221			1
his hometown of @entity223 , @entity224 , had planned a parade to celebrate @entity3 's homecoming but later canceled that celebration amid security concerns stemming from the unanswered questions surrounding his disappearance and the resulting controversy over his release			1
after returning to the @entity6 , @entity3 had been on active duty at an administrative job at @entity235 in @entity236 , @entity237			0
there , the @entity4 assigned @entity3 a " sponsor " to help him adjust to life in his new post			0
upon returning , @entity3 refused to meet with his parents -- and months later , @entity4 officials had said he was communicating with them but still had not met them face to face			0
the five figures the @entity6 exchanged to secure @entity3 's release were @entity247 , mullah @entity248 , mullah @entity249 , @entity250 and @entity251			1
they were mostly mid- to high - level officials in the @entity67 regime and had been detained early in the war in @entity122 because of their positions within the @entity67 , not because of ties to @entity258			0
the detainee swap for @entity3 has become increasingly controversial in recent weeks after a report published by the office of director of national intelligence @entity262 said one of the 17 intelligence agencies operating under its umbrella had judged that a prisoner released in the exchange had since contacted the @entity67			1
@entity2 's @entity269 and @entity270 contributed to this report .			0
