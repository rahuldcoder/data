@entity2 , @entity3 @entity0 has smashed priceless ancient statues in @entity5 , bulldozed the ruins of @entity7 and @entity8 , and dynamited centuries - old churches , mosques and shrines			1
in a battle between @entity3 forces and @entity0 over control of @entity17 recently , the tomb of @entity13 was squashed to rubble , though it 's not clear which side did it			1
luckily , the ancient city of @entity2 is outside the extremists ' grasp , south of @entity24			1
for nearly 5,000 years it has stood as a symbol of the glory of ancient @entity29 civilization			2
@entity13 renovated the ruins in the 1980s , leaving his own crude personal stamp on the bricks there			0
they bear his name and describe him as the son of @entity37 , who had the reputation of being ancient @entity2 's greatest king			1
one of @entity13 's former palaces still peers down over the city			2
but it continues to be source of great pride for @entity3 who see themselves as the heirs of the world 's oldest civilization			1
and many @entity3 know better than to buy the claims of their deposed despot			2
" this was n't @entity13 's , " said @entity51			2

@entity13 's vain brick inscriptions may annoy him , but @entity0 ' destruction appalls him			1
" the @entity5 museum was destroyed			0
why ? " he wants to know from @entity0			2
" that is the heritage of your grandfathers			0
why did you do that ? " the defacers ' reasoning ? the artifacts , some of the oldest in ancient civilization , are from the " age of ignorance , " @entity0 says , before the advent of @entity74			1
antiquity is an integral part of @entity3 's national identity			1
history is measured there not in centuries but in millennia , and @entity3 's take such vandalism to heart			1
they 've had to watch since the @entity86 invasion in 2003 how artifacts have been stolen			0
@entity24 's museum was plundered , during a lapse in @entity86 security , and the priceless artifacts were smuggled around the world			0

" when i saw what happened , i was determined to come her to preserve our antiquities from @entity0 , " he said			2
@entity3 will defend its heritage against @entity0 , said @entity109 from @entity3 's @entity110			1
" @entity2 is our soul			2
" it 's a soul under assault by latter day barbarians , who have destroyed much of it in the @entity114 , which has been out of the defensive reach of @entity3 soldiers			1
