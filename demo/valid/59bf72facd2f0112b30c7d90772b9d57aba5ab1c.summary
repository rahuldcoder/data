@entity3 , @entity4 on the surface , @entity1 co-pilot @entity0 seemed , in the words of those who had known him , normal , capable , even fun			1
but , @entity4 prosecutors said friday , he was clearly trying to hide something in the days before he sent @entity11 plowing into a mountain , killing himself and 149 others aboard			1
investigators searching @entity0 's @entity16 apartment said they found documents revealing he 'd been declared unfit for work			1
the letter , @entity16 prosecutor @entity20 , said , was found " slashed " in a dust bin			0
the revelation only adds to the myriad questions swirling around @entity0 , 27 , whom authorities say deliberately destroyed the plane			1
the biggest question of all , still , is why ? @entity29 ceo ' speechless ' that 's the question police were hoping to answer as they searched @entity0 's apartment			1
@entity34 spokesman @entity33 said a team of five investigators went " through the apartment looking for clues as to what the co-pilot 's motivation might have been , if he did indeed bring the plane down			2
" they did n't find a goodbye note or anything directly explaining the crash , the public prosecutor 's office in @entity16 said in a statement			2
they say it will be a few more days before they can say anything more publicly about what they found			0
outside the apartment , neighbors contacted friday said they did n't know @entity0 and are simply flummoxed by all the attention to the quiet suburban neighborhood featuring a handful of businesses , restaurants , running rails and a lake			1
meanwhile , about 85 miles ( 136 kilometers ) away in the town of @entity66 , the house where @entity0 's parents live was shuttered and guarded by police			1
a group of men , perhaps investigators , were the only ones granted access on thursday			2
on friday , there was no activity at all			0
@entity3 , in western @entity4 , is where @entity0 pursued his love of flying from a young age			1
at a club on the outskirts of town , pilots who knew @entity0 said they were shocked to hear what investigators said			1
they said the man they know never would have deliberately crashed a plane			2
between age 14 and age 20 , @entity0 was a regular fixture at the gliding club			1
" ( he was ) a very normal young person , full of energy , " @entity91 said			2
" what can i say ? he had a bright future			0
he made his hobby into his job			0
what more can you hope to achieve ? " the authorities ' explanation does n't ring true for @entity101 , another pilot who knew him from the flight club			2
" knowing @entity106 , this is just inconceivable for me , " @entity101 told the @entity105 news agency			0
" he was a lot of fun , even though he was perhaps sometimes a bit quiet , " @entity101 said			0
" he was just another boy , like so many others here			0
" an acquaintance said @entity0 was health conscious			1
he was a recreational athlete and did n't smoke			2
" i ca n't imagine that he was mentally ill , depressed and sad			1
he does n't seem like that , " @entity115 told @entity5			2
" so i was shocked when i heard that			0
" an 8 - minute descent to death before tuesday 's crash , @entity0 appeared to have a " clean bill of health , " according to a @entity1 representative			1
then came friday 's announcement of the discovery of documents revealing an illness that apparently made him unfit to fly a plane -- in the eyes of at least one doctor			1
prosecutors did n't reveal what the illness was , but said the discovery " leads to the preliminary conclusion , that the deceased kept his illness secret from his employer and his professional environment			1
" the @entity143 and the @entity144 , citing unnamed sources , reported that @entity0 suffered from mental illness			1
meanwhile , a @entity16 clinic said he 'd gone there twice , most recently 17 days ago , " concerning a diagnosis			2
" but the @entity149 said it had not treated @entity0 for depression			1
@entity0 had been with @entity1 , a budget airline owned by @entity29 , since september 2013 and had completed 630 hours of flight time , the airline 's media office said			1
officials say he passed a psychological test when he was hired , had no known ties to terrorism and showed no sign of medical distress during the flight			0
@entity29 ceo @entity161 told reporters that @entity0 " interrupted " his training , which he began in 2008			1
that break lasted several months , he said , but added that such an interruption is n't uncommon			2
@entity161 said he could n't give any information about why the co-pilot had stopped and then restarted his training			2
if it was for medical reasons , he said , then that information would have been private before the crash , but it will be part of information gathered during the investigation			0
@entity105 reported that a @entity4 newspaper , @entity174 , said @entity0 had been treated for depression about six years ago			1
citing internal documents forwarded by @entity29 to @entity4 authorities , @entity174 reported that @entity0 had suffered a " serious depressive episode " around the time he took a break from his pilot training in 2009 , @entity105 reported			1
the @entity174 report said he then spent about 18 months getting psychiatric treatment			0
@entity29 officials and @entity4 prosecutors declined to comment on the @entity174 story , @entity105 said			1
most of @entity0 's training took place at the @entity29 flight training center in @entity4			1
he also trained in the @entity191 , spending six months at facility in @entity193 as part of a required program to get his license , a @entity29 spokesperson said			0
a former trainer at the facility said the training is " extremely stressful			0
" " what made the hairs stand up on my neck in this case is that the co-pilot took some time off during training			0
for me that is very inexplicable and highly unusual , " @entity206 said			0
" usually the pilot trainees either progress or wash out , i never saw anyone take a break			0
" he clarified his remark , saying some people left due to a death in the family			0
@entity161 said @entity29 pilots get medical testing but do not undergo regular or routine psychological testing once they are flying			0
however , the airline does consider an applicant 's psychological state , along with other factors , when hiring pilots , he said			2
" we do n't only look at competence but we also give a lot of room to psychological capabilities , " @entity161 said			2
" he was 100 % set to fly without restrictions , " he added			0
" his flight performance was perfect			0
there was nothing to worry about			0
" students , singers among the victims 5 cases of pilots intentionally crashing @entity237 reported from @entity66			0
@entity238 and @entity239 reported from @entity240			0
@entity5 's @entity241 contributed to this report from @entity243 , @entity4			1
@entity5 's @entity244 , @entity245 , @entity247 @entity246 , @entity248 , @entity249 and @entity250 also contributed to this report .			0

newspapers cite sources who say @entity0 had a mental illness
@entity4 investigators say he 'd been declared unfit to work , but was hiding it from the airline
one man says @entity0 did n't seem like the kind of person who was sad or depressed
