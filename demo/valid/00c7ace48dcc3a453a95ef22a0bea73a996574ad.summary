for years , @entity0 have called on @entity3 owner @entity2 to change the team 's name			1
it 's a dictionary - defined racial slur that 's dehumanizing to @entity0			1
and , in my view , that outweighs the arguments of @entity3 advocates who defend the name as a symbol of team pride			0
but what about the thousands of high schools across the @entity16 that have the name as its mascot ? where do they fit in the debate ? once you factor in freedom of speech , how should one approach this issue ? recently , in @entity27 , the @entity26 @entity25 unanimously voted to retire its high school 's mascot and moniker -- the " @entity3			1
" the board called the mascot " a symbol of ethnic stereotyping " and said the school " can not continue practices which are offensive and hurtful to others " -- namely @entity0			1
some students opposed the board 's decision citing school legacy and tradition			1
a group of @entity45 students hosted a walk out in protest with many carrying placards reading , " @entity49 " and " @entity50 , always a redskin			0
" coincidentally , around the same time in @entity54 , the @entity52 of @entity53 announced it will begin to take steps to drop its " @entity3 " mascot before the beginning of the 2015 - 16 school year			1
local school districts are responding to the growing chorus of voices who oppose antiquated @entity63 mascots			1
furthermore , there 's research that shows @entity0 mascots and monikers harm the mental health of @entity63 youths			1
according to one study , @entity63 students are reported to have low self - esteem and a suppressed sense of self - worth as a consequence of such images and language			2
other research shows how all ethnic groups are hurt by poor representations of @entity0			1
people " are more likely to negatively stereotype other ethnic groups as well , " according to @entity83 , clinical assistant professor of psychology at the @entity85			0
what the @entity52 of @entity53 and the @entity26 school board decisions represent for @entity0 are hope -- for us and our kids -- that broader awareness is changing perspectives and that hurtful stereotypical nicknames should not have to be tolerated by any ethnic group			1
still , there 's the issue of free speech			2
many have made the argument that @entity0 like me are trampling on the @entity101 when we call for the @entity104 football team to change its name			1
even the @entity106 has chimed in on the matter			0
on march 6 , the organization said in a blog it does not support the @entity111 's decision to cancel federal trademark protection of the @entity104 football team 's use of the word " redskins			1
" in june of last year , the @entity111 had repealed six of the team 's seven trademarks , finding the r - word is " disparaging to @entity0			1
" although the @entity106 agrees the team name is " offensive and perpetuates racism against @entity0 , " it can not support what it refers to as language policing			1
" ... because the @entity101 protects against government interference in private speech , " staff attorney @entity125 wrote			0
" it is n't government 's role to pick and choose which viewpoints are acceptable and which are not			2
" here 's the thing , folks -- no one has a @entity101 right to federal trademark protection			2
@entity136 , a tribal rights attorney in @entity104 , said , " freedom of speech is a fundamental right			0
in contrast , federal trademark protection is a privilege that one applies for at the @entity111			0
" i think the @entity106 is confusing rights with privileges			0
the @entity16 government is n't telling the @entity104 football team it ca n't use the word			0
according to the @entity111 , @entity2 and his ilk can keep using the team name -- he just wo n't have federal trademark protection			0
last month , @entity151 rep. @entity150 of @entity152 filed a bill that would ban existing and future teams that use the word from receiving federal trademark protection			0
he told me he 's " disappointed " that the @entity106 would defend the @entity104 team , which he refers to as " a multi-billion dollar company profiting off a racial slur			1
" " @entity159 is not the issue here -- no one , including the football team , would be prohibited from using the name , " he wrote in an email			0
" the team would only lose their exclusive rights to it			0
" and in the case of @entity169 , the government did n't step in -- the decision to retire the name was made by conscientious objectors in the community			2
let 's look at the issue from another angle			2
what do we do as responsible adults when we learn a habit or tradition is adversely affecting our children ? we do everything we can to fix the problem			0
what we do not do is make excuses so we can continue the terrible habit			0
as the late @entity190 so aptly put it , " do the best you can until you know better			0
then when you know better , do better			0
" @entity16 needs to do better as a whole with regard to @entity0			1
this is n't just about @entity0 mascots			1
this is n't just about offensive racial slurs			2
this is about the dehumanization of @entity0			1
and if history has shown us anything , it 's that when one group dehumanizes another , bad things happen			2
@entity209 's bill , the @entity111 's repeal and the @entity26 school board 's decision are not examples of anti-free speech madness			2
they are acting like responsible adults in defense of children who are at risk			0
and as for me , i 'll protect children first before i protect anyone 's right to harm them .			0

recently , schools are *deciding* to retire the term ' redskins ' for their mascots
@entity229 : it 's a dictionary - defined racial slur that 's dehumanizing to @entity0
