an @entity1 jury sentenced a woman who says she had a miscarriage to 20 years in prison			1
in 2013 , @entity6 showed up at a hospital emergency room suffering from severe vaginal bleeding			0
according to court documents , at first she denied that she had been pregnant but later told doctors that she had a miscarriage and delivered a stillborn fetus which , she said , she placed in a bag in a dumpster			2
@entity6 was later charged with feticide and felony neglect of a dependent , though these charges are decidedly contradictory			1
" @entity21 " would require @entity6 to have terminated a pregnancy while the fetus was still in the womb			0
on the other hand , " felony neglect of a dependent " requires delivering a live fetus and then neglecting it			1
as @entity28 of @entity29 pointed out in february , @entity6 " was convicted both of killing a baby and killing a fetus			0
" the only thing more preposterous than this is that @entity6 was charged in the first place			0
the evidence against her has been shaky from the start			0
initially , police questioned @entity6 when she was still in the hospital without an attorney present			0
prosecutors would later introduce text messages indicating that @entity6 had purchased miscarriage - inducing drugs , but there was no evidence @entity6 took the drugs			0
in fact , they did n't show up in blood tests just after she miscarried			2
nonetheless , after five hours of deliberation , a jury convicted @entity6 of two entirely contradictory crimes based on entirely circumstantial evidence			2
and on march 30 , 2015 , she was given a 30 - year - sentence on the felony neglect charge , 10 of which were suspended			2
she 'll serve a concurrent six - year sentence for feticide			2
@entity6 is the second pregnant woman to be charged under @entity1 's anti-choice " feticide " law			1
in 2011 , @entity57 was charged with feticide after she attempted to commit suicide when she was eight months pregnant			1
in 2013 , lawyers announced @entity57 had reached a plea agreement just before her trial was set to begin			0
still , both cases presented troubled pregnant women who needed help from medical authorities and their government			1
but @entity1 's harsh anti-abortion laws , and the broader culture that seeks to control the decisions pregnant women can make about their own bodies , make women far less likely to reach out for this help			1
conservatives like to say that women are the " victims of abortion " and that laws such as the @entity1 " feticide " measure are intended to " protect " them			1
years ago , the president of the anti-choice @entity82 made assurances that the specter of women being prosecuted and jailed under anti-choice laws was nothing more than fearmongering by pro-choice activists			1
the website of the @entity91 association similarly argues that " no one is interested in sending women to jail			2
" and in fact , the @entity1 " feticide " law was plainly intended to criminalize " knowing or intentional termination of another 's pregnancy			1
" but there 's no escaping the reality it has been used to turn pregnant women into criminals			1
so much for not sending women to jail			2
those who care about the rights of pregnant women should be deeply concerned			1
after all , @entity6 was convicted based on text messages about miscarriage - inducing drugs , not evidence she had used or even purchased such drugs			0
in @entity57 's case , it was presumed that the intent of her attempted suicide was to terminate her pregnancy and thus she was charged with feticide			1
so what else might be considered a " deliberate attempt " to terminate one 's own pregnancy ? if a woman knew about the risks of too vigorous exercise and miscarriage but exercised anyway ? merely googling abortion - inducing drugs ? telling a friend you 've thought about having an abortion ? the message from @entity6 's conviction is clear			2
after all , there have always been and will always be women who try to terminate their pregnancies			0
laws like @entity1 's and cases like @entity6 's do n't change that			1
what they do is make women hide , avoid medical attention and put their lives at even greater risk			1
in @entity146 , which last year enacted some of the most restrictive anti-abortion laws in the nation and shuttered the majority of its abortion services clinics , abortion rates have indeed declined but not in proportion to the severity of such measures			0
researchers suggest that 's partly because rates of self - abortion , which then go unreported in the statistics , are increasing			0
and anecdotal evidence suggests this is the case			0
before @entity165 made abortion legal in the @entity167 , according to the @entity168 , the number of illegal abortions in the 1950s and 1960s ranged from 200,000 to 1.2 million per year			0
new anti-choice restrictions and prosecutions wo n't change the fact that women will sometimes choose to terminate their pregnancies			0
it simply restricts their options to do so			0
ask yourself : in the case of @entity6 , even if she did intend to self - abort and used black market drugs to do so , and if she indeed delivered a live fetus , would n't we want to live in a society where she would bring that baby to the hospital for life - saving medical attention rather than be so afraid of prosecution that she threw it in a dumpster ? @entity6 is reportedly appealing her conviction			1
we should all appeal to logic and sanity and compassion and repeal these horrid anti-choice , anti-pregnancy laws .			0

@entity196 : @entity1 jury sentenced woman to 20 years , charging her with feticide and neglect of a dependent after she miscarried
she says absurd , *unjust* case makes pregnant women hide , avoid medical attention and put their lives at even greater risk
