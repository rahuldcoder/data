for @entity3 , the passage of @entity2 's new religious freedom law feels a lot like high school			1
the 26 - year - old was born a female but identifies as a man			1
that was a tough experience in @entity11 : looking like a girl , everyone treating you like one , but not feeling at home in your skin			2
classmates made fun of him			2
he and his parents fought			2
now they do n't talk			0
making it to his mid- 20s feels like a victory to him now , as does knowing that he has friends who support him , friends who are straight and gay and transgender			1
he had just gotten to a point of feeling accepted when the @entity2 state legislature passed the @entity33			1
" this law makes me feel like i 'm being bullied all over again , " he said			1
" if i go into a restaurant and the owner does n't like me because i 'm transgender , because their religion has told them that i 'm bad , does that give them the right to refuse to serve me ? proponents of the law , including gov. @entity44 , say that 's not what the law will do			1
he has said it 's intended to prevent the government from forcing anyone to do something that opposes their religious beliefs			1
some businesses and @entity55 are behind him			0
nationally influential @entity57 evangelist @entity56 , who lives in @entity58 , tweeted this week , " thank @entity59 for politicians like @ @entity62 who are not afraid to take a stand regardless of political consequences			0
" but there is a tidal wave of opposition throughout the state and across the country			0
critics say the law is a thinly veiled mechanism to legally sanction discrimination			1
protests have raged throughout the state and elsewhere			0
some religious leaders oppose it			0
civic groups , corporations and state governments , such as @entity81 and @entity82 , are vowing not to to do business with @entity2			1
the @entity2 @entity84 has blasted the law			1
so has the @entity86 its college basketball tournament is hosting the @entity88 in @entity89 this weekend			0
some businesses in the state are reacting by placing signs in windows that read , " we serve everyone			0
" @entity89 mayor @entity96 , a vocal opponent of the law , demanded : " fix this law			1
" he and others contend that because @entity2 , unlike other states , has no statewide law protecting gays and lesbians from discrimination , this religious freedom law is a license to discriminate			1
hundreds of protesters joined @entity3 in a demonstration on the streets of @entity11 monday			0
some said they would consider leaving the state because the law makes them feel unwelcome			2
@entity114 , 27 , organized a rally in @entity11 to protest the law			2
he grew up in @entity2 , but now he 's afraid to go into businesses with his boyfriend			1
" this is very personal , " he said			0
this is shameful for @entity2			1
is anyone infringing on someone 's religion ? @entity126 is about giving people the legal defense to refuse business to someone they do n't like based on sexual orientation			1
" @entity133 of @entity134 in @entity135 told @entity4 that he read the law , which runs four pages			2
he feels that the law merely protects his right to refuse to sell to a customer whose beliefs he thinks offend his catholic faith			1
that does n't include gay customers , he insists			0
" we have no issues serving a same sex couple at all , " he said			0
" the law is strictly protecting people from the government to forcefully make them do something against their will			2
" @entity4 asked him to give an example of what might offend him , and cause him to refuse to sell to someone			0
" anything that promotes hate or a derogatory statement that someone believes is ok , " he answered			0
" i do n't want to take my personal time making a product that spews hate into the world			0
" that 's never happened in @entity134 's 35 - year history , he said , but it could and that 's why he thinks the law is needed			1
the owner has shared his opinion with local media , and that has sparked a fierce backlash from many in the community , he said			2
" we 've been called homophobic and hypocrites , " he said			0
" we 've also experienced a very large amount of support			0
" our phones have not stopped ringing from people all over the state and country			0
we 've gotten e-mails saying ' i appreciate you standing up			0
thank you for standing up for our rights			0
' " @entity2 pastor @entity187 told @entity4 monday that he supports the law , too			1
" as someone who walks in my religious freedom all the time , i 'm glad i have something to protect me , " he said			0
" i do n't see the law as discriminatory			2
i just see it protecting people from any type of business or anyone trying to infringe on their religious rights			2
" @entity187 blamed @entity44 's office for its " inability to educate " people about what the law says			1
there should have been public meetings about it , @entity187 said			0
the @entity209 reported that the ceremony where @entity44 signed the bill into law on thursday was " deliberately low - key and private " and closed to media			1
the governor 's staff office , it said , refused to provide names of people who surrounded @entity44 as he signed			2
to @entity133 , the law does n't explicitly use the word discrimination and that , to him , means it wo n't lead to discrimination			1
the law states that the government ca n't " substantially burden a person 's exercise of religion " and that individuals who feel like their religious beliefs have been or could be " substantially burdened " can lean on this law to fend off lawsuits			1
an often used example : a florist who does n't want to sell flowers to a gay couple or a baker who does n't want to make their wedding cake			0
those are arguably businesses that can choose which client to hire and which to reject , proponents of the law say			2
@entity4 legal analyst @entity245 said it 's likely that a refusal to serve a gay person would n't stand under the law , but a refusal to provide a service for a gay wedding would			1
" @entity2 is n't the first state to establish this law , " @entity133 said			1
" it 's nothing new for the @entity257 and the state of @entity2			1
" @entity133 is right that @entity2 is n't the first state to adopt a religious freedom law , but the situation is a little more complicated than that			1
@entity2 is the 20th state to adopt a " religious freedom restoration " law			1
for instance , bills in @entity265 , @entity266 and @entity267 with similar wording were proposed			0
the effort in @entity265 failed in 2014			0
@entity266 's bill has not been voted on and the legislative session ends thursday			2
the @entity267 bill stalled in 2014			0
a similar bill is proposed in @entity275			0
in @entity277 monday night , protesters demonstrated against a bill called the @entity279			0
as the bill 's creator , @entity280 rep. @entity280 left a meeting monday , protesters shouted : " shame on you ! " in the past , religious freedom laws were enacted with broad support			2
many were passed before the recent movement for gay rights and before the majority of states came to recognize same - sex marriage			2
but when it was introduced in december , the bill that became @entity297 's religious freedom law incited fierce debate among faith leaders , businesses and residents , the @entity209 newspaper reports			1
@entity302 watched as that debate raged over the holidays and into the new year , hoping that the bill would not pass			0
he lives in @entity306 , @entity2 , where about 1,100 people live			1
@entity2 recognized gay marriage last october			1
@entity309 married his longtime partner in december			0
" i understand politics in @entity2			1
i know it 's conservative			2
i get that this is about politics , " he said			0
" because i can see it as politics , i 'm not mad			0
" but he also said that he feels the law is " about bigotry , plain and simple			1
" " it 's taking us back decades , removing so much progress toward equality in @entity2 , " he said			1
@entity309 worries that the law could not only allow discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation			1
he wonders if it " could conceivably be used for @entity327 businesses to refuse service to @entity329 and @entity57			0
protestants and @entity335 could shun each other , " @entity309 wrote in a @entity333			0
" mainline church members could say , ' no ' to evangelicals			0
" on social media , debate over the law showed no signs of letting up			2
in response to @entity57 leader @entity56 's tweet supporting the law , someone with the username @entity348 tweeted , " amen using his @entity59 given right			1
" @entity351 tweeted them back : " no : as an elected official , his rights are not @entity59 given , they are voter given			0
" @entity4 's @entity356 , @entity357 , @entity358 , @entity359 and @entity360 contributed to this report .			2
