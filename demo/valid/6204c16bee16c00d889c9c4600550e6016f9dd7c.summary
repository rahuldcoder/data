@entity0 , the co-pilot who authorities say deliberately crashed @entity3 in @entity4 , passed all his tests and medical exams and gave no voluntary indication that he was unstable or mentally ill , @entity9 ceo @entity8 told @entity1 thursday			1
" we have at @entity9 a reporting system where crew can report without being punished their own problems or they can report about problems of others without any kind of punishment			2
that has n't been used either in this case , so all these safety nets we are so proud of here have not worked in this case , " @entity8 said			1
@entity0 had been with @entity3 since september 2013 and had completed 630 hours of flight time after training at the airline 's flight center in @entity28 , @entity29 , the company has said			0
@entity3 is the budget carrier for @entity9			0
the ceo said he did n't know much more than what has been released by @entity4 authorities : the captain left the cockpit , tried to regain access by knocking on the door and " the door was either kept locked or not opened in the way it was supposed to be , and that for sure is a clear indication that the remaining pilot -- the co-pilot -- did n't want the captain to return			1
" had the copilot suffered a medical emergency -- as some experts speculated in the initial hours after the accident -- there are safety procedures in place so that the pilot can re-access the cockpit , he said			0
that is , " unless the person on the inside locks it and this apparently has happened here , " the ceo said			0
after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks , cockpit doors were manufactured to withstand manual force and small weapons , so there was " no way to get back to the cockpit for the captain , " he said			0
@entity8 was asked why @entity0 was allowed to be alone in the cockpit			0
@entity67 airlines require that any pilot leaving the flight deck be replaced by a flight attendant , so that two people remain in the cockpit at all times , but that 's not the case with all airlines internationally , @entity1 aviation analyst @entity65 said			1
an 8 - minute descent to death a @entity9 spokesman previously said that the airline complies with all @entity29 and @entity81 aviation regulations , something @entity8 reiterated in his @entity1 interview			1
" most airlines around the world follow the same procedures as @entity9 that in flight phases with low workload , the pilot can leave the cockpit -- especially for physical need -- and then he returns to the cockpit as fast as he can			0
that 's a global thing , most accepted procedure , which we have used at @entity9 for many , many years , " @entity8 said			1
asked if the airline might reconsider this policy in light of tuesday 's crash , @entity8 said it was possible			2
" i think we look at that as well , but we should not put the whole system at stake just because of this terrible single accident , " he said			0
the airline will be consulting with its own experts , aviation authorities and experts with other airlines to determine what , if any , of its procedures need to be bolstered to prevent future such accidents from occurring , @entity8 said , adding that he stood strongly by the manner in which @entity9 operates airplanes and trains its employees			2
" we understand emotions after this terrible accident , but for us as professionals we need to ensure the safety focus of @entity9 is in no way touched -- and i promise you it 's not -- and we will do our very , very best to even improve it further			2
" who was co-pilot @entity0 ? @entity1 's @entity124 conducted the interview in @entity126 , @entity29 , and @entity127 wrote the story from @entity129			1
@entity1 's @entity130 contributed to this report .			1

" so all these safety nets *...* have not worked in this case , " @entity9 ceo tells @entity1
there 's clear indication co-pilot " did n't want the captain to return , " @entity8 says
