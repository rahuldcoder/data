foreign intervention in @entity3 's chaos has dramatically raised the stakes in the @entity5 , threatening to expand what is already a civil war into a conflict pitting @entity9 against @entity10 and an @entity12 coalition			1
the @entity10 launched @entity23 " last wednesday with dozens of airstrikes in an effort to blunt the advance of @entity17 militia and allied army units on the port of @entity20 -- and to protect the last bastion of @entity3 's internationally - recognized president @entity22			1
there were also strikes in and around the capital , @entity26 , which resumed early monday			0
many analysts were surprised at the speed and scale of the @entity10 air campaign , which the @entity31 said would continue until the @entity17 -- a @entity33 minority that has swept across the country in the last six months -- retreated and laid down their arms			1
essentially the @entity10 are trying to bomb the @entity17 to the negotiating table			1
the @entity17 have responded by threatening a campaign of suicide bomb attacks inside @entity10			1
@entity9 , which has supported the @entity17 as fellow @entity33 , described the @entity10 offensive as a " dangerous move that would kill any chance at peaceful resolution of the crisis			1
" @entity3 is becoming the latest battleground in a contest for regional superiority between @entity10 and @entity9 that goes back to the overthrow of the @entity49 during @entity9 's @entity50 in 1979			1
it now resembles @entity52 , or @entity53 20 years ago : a patchwork of shifting fiefdoms where force is the only means of influence			0
there is a real risk that @entity3 will collapse as a state , with a revived independence movement in the south , the @entity17 in the north , and the @entity66 heartland in between			1
@entity67 , a visiting fellow at the @entity68 and expert on @entity3 's tortured recent history , says , " it 's not difficult to divine @entity10 and its coalition partners ' motivations for taking this action			1
" the @entity17 were on the verge of overrunning @entity20 , a strategic port that overlooks straits through which 20,000 merchant ships pass every year			0
according to the @entity81 @entity80 , 3.8 million barrels of oil a day passed through the @entity82 in 2013			0
but @entity67 believes the @entity31 's " decision to launch a full - scale military action truly risks inflaming the situation further			0
it will be seen as an act of aggression by most @entity3 and risks taking the situation to a place that no - one will be able to control			1
" as in @entity93 , factions in @entity3 do not respond well to foreign intervention			1
in 2009 the @entity10 took military action against the @entity17 in support of then president @entity97 , using airstrikes and special forces , but were unable to subdue them			1
now the @entity17 have at least some of the $ 500 million in military equipment provided by the @entity81 to @entity3 since 2010 , and they have proved to be capable fighters			1
they staged a lightning invasion of the capital , @entity26 , last september , taking advantage of popular discontent and an unwillingness among many army units to resist them			0
since then they have moved on the @entity113 port of @entity114 and surged south toward @entity20			0
they have also grafted themselves onto parts of the army in the battle against @entity120 ( @entity120 ) that is now raging in central and southern @entity3			1
whether @entity10 and @entity123 ground forces will become involved in the conflict is the big unknown			1
an @entity127 summit in @entity123 at the weekend agreed to form a joint military force , but that will take months at least to build			0
in the meantime , @entity10 tanks and armor have been moved closer to the @entity3 border , but @entity10 officials say there are no immediate plans to launch a ground offensive			1
@entity3 has history as a graveyard of foreign forces			2
in the 1960s @entity123 intervened in @entity3 's civil war on behalf of the anti-royalists -- an operation that sapped the @entity123 army and contributed to its failure against the @entity146 in the 1967 war			1
the extent of the @entity17 ' backing from @entity9 is hotly disputed			2
president @entity22 said at the weekend that @entity9 was behind @entity3 's turmoil and the @entity17 were no more than its stooges			1
the @entity17 deny receiving help from @entity9 , but as the conflict worsens , they may indeed turn to @entity156 for the sort of military advice that the @entity159 are providing in @entity160 -- and for funding and oil			2
@entity10 and @entity9 involvement in @entity3 threatens to deepen sectarian distrust in a country where @entity66 and @entity33 have historically not been enemies			1
this would suit both @entity120 and @entity168 ( @entity169 in @entity52 and @entity160 ) which announced its sudden and murderous arrival in @entity3 this month with massive suicide bombings at two @entity17 mosques in @entity26 , killing at least 150 people			2
as the @entity176 puts it , a " long history of coexistence is beginning to break down " in @entity3			2
@entity67 says one critical question is whether @entity168 and @entity120 will now go head - to - head in trying to kill as many @entity17 as possible			0
for the @entity81 , which worked hard to " stand up " the @entity22 government and encourage its campaign to eradicate @entity120 , recent events have been a disaster			0
there will be less actionable intelligence against one of @entity120 's most potent affiliates , and its @entity66 allies in the @entity188 ( and especially the @entity189 ) will have even less interest than before in dialogue with @entity9 on issues from its nuclear program to @entity160			2
@entity81 options have also diminished with the hurried withdrawal of some 100 military personnel from @entity197 in the south of @entity3 hours before it was seized by the @entity17			2
drone operations from the base had at least blunted @entity120 's freedom of action , even if they failed to eradicate the group			0
the unseen hand in @entity3 's collapse is former president @entity97 , who was badly injured in a bomb attack in 2011 , and eventually ( very eventually ) persuaded to cede office to @entity22 after 33 years in power			2
but he was allowed to remain in the country and has not given up his political ambitions			0
last fall , he was sanctioned by both the @entity211 and the @entity81 for undermining efforts to forge a new political settlement in @entity3			2
@entity67 believes @entity97 is biding his time -- waiting for an opportunity to inject his son , @entity216 , into @entity3 's complex political equation			2
@entity216 was formerly commander of @entity3 's @entity218 , and parts of the armed forces are still regarded as loyal to the @entity97 clan			2
for now , @entity97 has a marriage of convenience with the @entity17 , but few expect it to survive			0
when he was president , @entity97 launched a series of brief wars against the @entity17 between 2004 and 2010			0
" neither trusts the other ; their recent cooperation notwithstanding , they are competing for political dominance , especially in the northern tribal highlands and the military , " says the @entity176			0
for the people of @entity3 , the brief flash of hope that came with the @entity237 is now a distant memory			0
last week , at least nine protesters were killed in the central city of @entity242 and more than 100 injured by @entity17 militia			0
@entity20 has been rocked by looting and score - settling among rival clans			0
" human rights in @entity3 are in free - fall as even peaceful protest becomes a life - threatening activity , " according to @entity249 of @entity250			1
for the past three years , different parties and factions have fought over the state 's few assets while the standard of living of ordinary @entity3 has continued to plummet			0
a @entity211 - led effort to agree on a new constitution has been mired in squabbling , with all parties failing to honor commitments			1
" even more damaging , those with most influence -- the @entity10 and @entity9 in particular -- are taking steps to undercut the negotiations , " says the @entity176			1
" this combination of proxy wars , sectarian violence , state collapse and militia rule has become sadly familiar in the region			0
nobody is likely to win such a fight , " the @entity176 says			0
but for now , such a fight seems destined to continue .			0
