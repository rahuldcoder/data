the attempts by some in the @entity3 to undermine president @entity6 's @entity5 policy certainly seem extraordinary			1
first , the @entity3 leadership invited @entity8 to speak to @entity9 without consulting the @entity10 , and he duly warned against softening of the @entity13 's line on @entity5			1
now , 47 senators have written an open letter to the @entity5 regime to advise that any deal agreed to with @entity6 could be reversed after the 2016 presidential election			1
it is an astonishing move			0
but this is not , strictly speaking , unique			2
people in both parties have done far more remarkable things in the past			0
back in 1983 , sen. @entity25 tried to set up a personal diplomatic channel with the @entity27 -- effectively sidestepping president @entity28			2
working through proxies , he suggested that he visit @entity30 to meet with the communist leadership and offered to help them make their case to the @entity35 people as to why they preferred dialogue over confrontation			0
as @entity40 journalist @entity39 notes in his book " the @entity42 , " this occurred close to a @entity35 presidential election , and some conservatives have interpreted it as an act of treason -- perhaps even a breach of the @entity49 , which forbids private citizens from engaging in diplomacy with the goal of changing foreign policy			1
one might argue that the senator was motivated by high ideals : he had a clear record of campaigning to reduce @entity60 tensions and thought @entity28 was mishandling the @entity27			0
on more than one occasion , @entity25 politicized foreign policy while in the @entity63			1
in my book on the 1980 @entity67 presidential primaries , i note that @entity25 opposed @entity69 's hard - line stance on the @entity27 invasion of @entity71 -- a position that was well - intentioned , prophetic and somewhat advantageous to @entity25 's campaign for the @entity67 nomination			2
but it 's not only democrats who have done that			0
in 1968 , the presidential election looked close			0
with the @entity83 administration edging toward a peace deal in @entity85 , @entity79 's team rolled the dice			2
according to an account in @entity88 , @entity89 , a @entity3 activist , was given a message to pass onto the @entity93 government : if they undermined the peace talks by being stubborn , the @entity76 would lose the election and @entity79 as the next president would offer them better terms			1
the @entity93 indeed proved intransigent , and the @entity3 won the @entity10			2
no evidence exists directly tying @entity79 personally to the conspiracy , but we now know for sure that it happened and it 's far hard to imagine that it would have gone ahead without his knowledge			0
there is a view that it bordered on treason and -- again -- makes the 2015 @entity3 efforts look tame by comparison			2
the extreme lengths that @entity25 and @entity79 went to behind the scenes underlines the point that foreign policy has always been a deeply partisan matter that can often end in a challenge to executive authority			1
it 's true that the spirit of the @entity119 indicates that the country is expected to speak with one voice on foreign policy through the president			1
but such harmony has n't always been possible			0
recall that @entity9 and the @entity69 @entity10 tore themselves apart over the @entity124			0
that the @entity28 administration 's policy in @entity127 was so controversial that his staffers sent aid to the rebels through back channels , and the then - @entity67 @entity10 speaker , @entity133 , was accused of presenting a private peace plan to the left - wing government			2
that @entity137 's 1994 nuclear deal with @entity138 was criticized by both @entity3 and @entity76			1
or that @entity76 did their best to defund the @entity139			0
as @entity141 writes , foreign policy is generally conducted quietly by the @entity10 through executive agreements that pass without comment			1
but the idea that foreign policy is beyond partisanship is na√Øve , and disagreements have gone public when the political conditions are appropriate			1
the particular matter of the @entity5 talks is sensitive for the @entity3 because it involves the electoral holy trinity of @entity6 , @entity151 and the presidential primaries			1
they were n't going to walk away from this one , and we can hardly be surprised that they have n't			0
the democrats would do the same if the situation were reversed , as they have many times in the past			0
in a republic purposefully designed to have limited executive power , with a competitive two - party system bolted on to keep its politics fluid , this was arguably inevitable .			0

@entity167 : @entity3 senators ' letter to @entity5 leaders seems extraordinary
but undermining a president 's foreign policy is not at all unique , @entity167 says
he says both left , right have gone around administrations to deal with foreign leaders
