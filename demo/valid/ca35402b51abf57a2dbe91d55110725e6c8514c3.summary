as the world digests the shock of @entity5 opposition leader @entity4 's brutal murder in front of the @entity7 on friday , everybody is trying to determine who was behind it			1
the @entity5 authorities were quick to throw out a number of theories , which ranged from the @entity14 to @entity15 , and even to @entity4 's relationship troubles			1
while most people have discounted these out of hand , there are a surprising number of people who have bought into the statement , released by @entity24 's spokesman , that " @entity4 was only slightly more than an average statistical citizen " -- implying that the @entity5 president would have no reason to want him dead			1
first of all , that is not true			0
@entity4 may not have been a significant threat two years ago when oil prices were high and @entity5 were feeling politically apathetic -- but with oil prices down 50 % , the ruble down 50 % , the economy shrinking and companies firing people , a charismatic opposition politician like @entity4 is a real and direct threat to @entity24 , who is terrified of experiencing a @entity15 - style revolution in @entity5 , especially when there is an unpredictable economic crisis brewing			1
@entity4 's corruption expos√©s laid out , in damning detail , the truth behind the personal wealth of @entity24 and his cronies ; one does n't need to be an expert to see the similarities with former @entity15 president @entity49 , who fled @entity50 following popular uprisings in february of last year			1
@entity4 was also preparing a paper documenting the experiences of @entity5 soldiers in @entity15 -- one that could have dealt a catastrophic blow to the @entity5 propaganda machine about the @entity15 conflict			1
and he was instrumental in organizing the march 1 anti-war rally in @entity60 -- a protest march he would have led , had he not been gunned down just hours before			2
the benefit of this murder to @entity24 was n't just that it eliminated one opponent of the president , but that it will terrorize an entire class of dissidents			2
read more : other critics of @entity24 who ended up dead @entity24 has a history of viciously attacking the most important person in any given group of enemies , in order to send a message to the rest of them			1
in 2003 , he did this by arresting and imprisoning the richest oligarch in the country , @entity82			0
when @entity82 was put on trial in 2004 , @entity24 allowed the television cameras film the wealthiest man in the country sitting in a cage			2
imagine that you were the 17th richest man in @entity5 , and you saw a man more successful and influential than you sitting in a courtroom cage			2
what would you do ? anything you could to avoid meeting the same fate ; in the case of @entity5 's oligarchs , they all fell into line and were never a problem for the president again			2
the same thing happened with the murder of investigative journalist and vocal @entity24 critic @entity102 in 2006			2
although @entity7 involvement in her killing was never proved , the number of brave , outspoken investigative journalists in @entity5 dropped to only a handful after her death			1
now , in 2015 , one of the most vocal opposition leaders has been gunned down directly in front of the @entity7			0
in addition to the political benefits of @entity4 's demise , his killing also sends a clear and chilling message to anyone else who is similarly outspoken against @entity24 : it does n't matter how well known you are , how many heads of state in the @entity122 know you , or how many people would be outraged by your death			1
if you cause problems , you can and will be killed			0
not only does this have a powerful effect on other opposition leaders , but it puts a primordial fear into the minds of average @entity5 citizens , who may now think twice before taking to the streets to protest corruption , the war in @entity15 , or the poor standards of living			2
no matter your agenda , is it worth your life ? the @entity122 needs to act urgently , with actions , not words			0
this is the most brazen high - profile assassination of a political opposition leader in modern @entity5 history			1
so what can be done ? firstly , create , without any delay , an independent international inquiry into @entity4 's assassination			0
no investigation conducted solely by the @entity5 government would be credible under the circumstances , because it can not impartially examine the possible complicity of @entity24 or the @entity5 secret service in this act			1
there are statutory instruments in place for this kind of investigation , using the @entity160 , the @entity161 , and the @entity162			0
secondly , @entity4 was a passionate supporter of " @entity166 sanctions , " visa bans and asset freezes targeted specifically at kleptocrats and human rights abusers			0
it would befit his legacy if @entity172 governments would finally impose these sanctions , and stop accepting the billions of dollars which beneficiaries of the corrupt @entity24 regime are able to keep safely in @entity122 banks			0
these sanctions will also act as a real consequence if the @entity5 government refuses to cooperate with an independent inquiry into @entity4 's murder			1
the only reason that someone was bold enough to kill @entity4 was because a string of previous murders were met with words of condemnation , but no real action from the @entity122			0
@entity186 , @entity102 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity166 and now @entity4			0
how many others need to die before real action is taken ? this is a watershed moment , not just for @entity5 , but for the @entity122			0
we have a responsibility to the future @entity196 of this world to make sure that these assassinations will no longer go unpunished .			0
