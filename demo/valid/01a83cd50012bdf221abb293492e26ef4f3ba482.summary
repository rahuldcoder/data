the debate over health care reform once again blooms in @entity4 , but this time @entity7 and the president whose legacy rests on the @entity9 are tending a garden challenged by some rather invasive species			1
the @entity12 has kicked off its season by pulling @entity9 up by the roots in its proposed 2016 @entity16 budget			1
but this budget will not become law			0
and so @entity12 are also preparing strategic plays if the @entity21 rules in their favor this summer , or if a @entity12 wins the @entity16 next year backed by complementary majorities in the @entity16 and @entity24			1
either scenario would mortally wound @entity9			1
but this is n't a zero sum game			0
@entity28 already know they do n't win just because the other side loses			0
upending @entity9 may poison the @entity12 's standing with 16.4 million @entity31 who will face adverse , even dire consequences without legislative patches to the law , or a swift switch to a solid alternative health care policy			1
this week , the conservative weekly @entity37 aimed to mark @entity9 's fifth anniversary by asking a panel whether to " reform , replace or restart " the law			1
a gas leak scuttled the event			0
once they 've regrouped for their next panel , @entity12 should instead entertain a different @entity45 : revise			1
so far every plan republicans are offering strikes out any mandate to purchase insurance , which , oddly for a party celebrating self - reliance , encourages some people to continue shifting their adult responsibilities onto others			0
many of the @entity12 plans replace the subsidies that make exchange plans affordable for low - income @entity31 with tax credits			1
tax credits do n't make much sense when you do n't have a lot of taxes to pay in the first place			0
these alternatives appear to be thinly veiled transitions away from the key @entity9 principle of providing guaranteed access			1
to date the law has reduced the rates of uninsured @entity31 by a whopping 35 %			2
sen. @entity73 , @entity74 , lifted his veil even during his own plan 's debut by insisting " every last word of @entity9 must be repealed " while promoting his own @entity79 that ditches subsidies and the mandate			2
@entity12 presidential front - runner @entity82 shares @entity73 's preference to dismantle the " monstrosity " altogether , describing his preference for cheaper catastrophic insurance that helps people with massive bills but leaves poor @entity31 to fend for themselves when it comes to needless perks -- like insulin and blood pressure pills			1
and besides repealing the @entity9 , @entity94 chairman @entity93 , @entity95 , wants to tear into president @entity98 's @entity97 achievements as well			2
his budget proposal dismantles the federal medicaid program by slashing its funding and devolving it to the states , while asking seniors on @entity104 to try their luck with a voucher - discounted private insurance			1
what these approaches do n't get is that we live in a country entirely populated by citizens who want and expect to receive medical care when they need it , yet not all of these citizens want to pay anything for the privilege			0
the beating heart of @entity9 is its mandate to purchase health insurance , which keeps costs down for everyone , makes it fiscally feasible to cover patients with pre-existing conditions , and makes government subsidies possible for those who ca n't afford any insurance without them			1
if @entity12 shift their focus to revising @entity9 , there are an array of spots to trim and weeds to pull , and they can expect many @entity7 to join in the work			1
but after dealing with a withering onslaught of over 60 @entity12 attempts to kill the bill , @entity7 ca n't make even the most basic fixes for fear of losing everything			1
but there are some places to look			0
even @entity9 supporters can acknowledge some specific anti-competitive features in the law			2
the @entity9 's push toward offloading risk onto hospitals rather than insurers is encouraging hospital consolidation , with large hospital corporations seeking to build economies of scale to offset future risk this trend may drive up costs as hospitals face less competition			2
meanwhile consumers shopping the exchange plans can select from few in - network hospitals and physicians , again making the health care marketplace less competitive			0
the @entity31 may be graced with institutions offering stellar care in complex conditions that attract patients across state lines as well as across the world , centers that contribute to medicine generally through their research and training			2
but going out of state to seek such care is n't an option for many patients on exchange plans			0
@entity73 proposes opening up health insurance markets nationally , an idea that we should build on			0
years of a rough economy have left many consumers without the income or savings to pay the high copays , deductibles , and out - of - pocket maximums that @entity9 uses as a cost - control measure			2
among families making 250 % to 400 % over the federal poverty line , 55 % to 68 % ca n't make their deductible , depending on their plan			0
the numbers are considerably worse for families under that threshold , and even for families making over 400 % of the poverty line , 25 % to 38 % ca n't pay the out of pocket maximum if they become seriously ill. despite these costs , the @entity9 penalizes responsible consumers further by capping flexible spending accounts			2
furthermore , @entity9 is in part more expensive than it might be because it takes a gamble covering preventive testing for people with no sign of disease for " free , " yet makes patients with chronic conditions pay deductibles even when we know their care will save money in the long run			1
that 's not the most rational distribution of funds if we 're trying to do the greatest good for the greatest number at the lowest cost			0
since @entity82 is interested in focusing on the big - ticket items and not sweating the small stuff , perhaps this is an area where he can throw his support			0
@entity9 is n't a work of art by any means			0
it 's a messy , pragmatic attempt to reach a goal the majority of @entity31 want : access to affordable health care when it 's needed			0
some rather fundamental revisions lie ahead , like a forthcoming administrative decision on whether to continue allowing state variability among the prescribed @entity237 it covers			0
so , my advice to @entity12 is that they pick one or two specific aspects of @entity9 they 'd like to improve , let 's have the policy debate , then introduce your legislative fix to the existing law , leaving its beating heart intact			1
show you 're open to constructively improving the @entity9 and i 'm sure we 'll see @entity7 start coming to the table with their own pet peeves about the law			0
2016 does n't have to be a hyperbolic , hyperventilating contest for the fate of 16.4 million @entity31 .			1

@entity256 : with its budget proposal to kill @entity9 , or hopes the @entity21 will do the same , the @entity12 makes a *mistake*
he says 16.4 million @entity31 benefiting . smart @entity12 know this ; should instead tease out *problematic* parts of @entity9 to revise
