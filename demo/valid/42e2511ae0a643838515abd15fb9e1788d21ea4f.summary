last november , the @entity1 people placed a great amount of trust in @entity5 when they gave them complete control of @entity7			1
voters bought the illusion that a @entity5 @entity7 would govern effectively , help the middle class and focus on important issues like jobs and the economy			1
now , after two months , that illusion has been shattered			0
over the last two weeks , we have seen the @entity7 manufacture , then escalate , a political crisis by threatening to shut down the @entity18			1
there is no government task more basic than keeping citizens safe			0
and yet @entity5 are recklessly putting our national security at risk to protect their own political security			2
by failing to do a full extension of @entity18 funding â€” holding it hostage with demands that the legislation roll back the president 's immigration actions -- @entity5 are leaving uncertain the livelihoods of more than 240,000 men and women who proudly serve as employees of the @entity38 , @entity39 and other @entity18 agencies			1
local law enforcement will continue to be denied access to the grants that help them keep our streets safe			0
the @entity47 and other agencies that respond to natural disasters , like major winter storms , would have their operations disrupted			0
all so @entity5 can try to score a few cheap political points with their base			0
but while this shutdown crisis is scary , what is even scarier is that this dysfunctional governing style is becoming a pattern with the @entity5			0
the @entity7 seems more intent on bickering with itself , pushing an agenda to help special interests and catering to the most extreme wing of the party , than working for the middle class			1
these last two months have been a disgrace , a disservice to our country , and the @entity1 people wo n't soon forget what a reckless disaster republicans in @entity7 have turned out to be .			2

@entity74 : @entity1 voted in a @entity5 @entity7 on *promise* of effective governance that **prioritized** middle class
he says that was an illusion . on @entity18 funding , other issues , @entity5 has **prioritized** catering to its extreme wing and special interests
