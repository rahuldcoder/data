as a well - traveled photographer , @entity1 ten @entity0 is no stranger to refugee camps			1
but he never experienced any like the @entity7 camp , which is outside the @entity9 capital of @entity10			1
ten @entity11 was at the camp to photograph a new medical clinic for @entity14 , a humanitarian group from @entity15			1
he also hoped to document what life was like for refugees there			1
his hopes were dashed , however , when he was told he could n't photograph outside the hospital compound			1
" i had very , very hard restrictions from the @entity9 government			1
... they are very well - skilled in keeping the media at bay , " ten @entity24 said			1
with no freedom of movement , much like the refugees themselves , ten @entity24 resorted to an old trick he had used before while traveling in @entity33			1
with the help of refugee hospital workers , he built a makeshift photo studio using hospital bed sheets and other materials available			1
the studio quickly became a sensation			1
once hospital employees volunteered to have their photo taken , lines of refugees began snaking around the hospital grounds waiting to have their portraits taken			1
one by one , these people sat solemnly to be photographed			2
it was their time to be acknowledged			2
there was gravity , earnestness to the way they posed			2
this was the moment their story would be registered			2
" this was one of the reasons why i built the studio : to get more material and more narratives from the people , " ten @entity24 said			1
the project quickly became a catalog of the history and identity of the refugees			1
the photos span several generations -- some of the subjects were born at the refugee camp , some have been there for decades			1
women wearing the traditional @entity9 tobe spell out their class and origin by the way it is wrapped			1
from the @entity81 north , women are fully covered -- a contrast to women from the @entity85 south , who we also see represented in these photos			2
@entity89 from @entity9 , @entity90 or @entity91 , the faces become , individually and collectively , a portrait of the endless wars that have shaped the @entity94			1
social media follow @ @entity96 on @entity97 to join the conversation about photography			2
the word refugee often conjures up images of faceless crowds fleeing conflict , their existence only registered in terms of statistics and graphs			0
@entity24 wanted to give his subjects the ability to express themselves freely			1
" they got very serious , they sat down upright			0
... i tried to say as little as possible , " he said			0
" i do believe in their own expressions , their own narrative ... and their unique perspective			0
" the studio had a comforting effect			2
it was a haven from the hustling and bustling of the camp hospital			1
it gave the photographer an opportunity to meet his subject matter eye to eye , giving each person their deserved attention			0
aesthetically , it created an aura around each person , beaming light on his or her personal narrative			0
it had some uplifting effects as well			0
" i always try to put some extra thought to ( projects )			0
so i build classic photo studios like they have in any small towns in the @entity33 continent or in @entity139 ... just to give people a little bit of the feeling they are special for a short time and that someone really photographs them in an official way , " ten @entity24 said			1
he said some patients at the hospital " had being laying there for months in their room			2
... then you take them out , it 's a little treat to get them out of their own misery			0
... that 's why you see the line growing , because they see people laughing when they come out of the studio			2
" ten - month - old @entity163 was not laughing when she entered the studio			1
having just had a blood test for malaria , she clearly looked uneasy			0
gazing to someone who is holding her hand , her eyes connect with this parental figure as a source of strength			0
@entity172 , 40 , came from the war - torn @entity174 region before getting a job as a cleaner at the hospital			2
as she wears a simple tobe , one can almost see the emotions behind her leonine stare			0
her life and struggle , as with the other individuals photographed , is accounted for with the testimony of a camera			0
ten @entity187 used tilt - shift lenses , which are normally used with the large - format cameras used in classic photography			2
" i really can appreciate old portraiture ... when people got their portrait taken in a way that was loaded , i think , with respect and it was a very serious moment , " he said			0
" it 's a slow way of working where you have to put all your focus into one person sitting in front of you			0
" how did ten @entity187 gain the trust of so many uneasy refugees , some severely traumatized and living in fear ? " it was n't hard , " he said			1
" i just told them to relax and have fun			0
" kids sometimes got nervous , and i do n't blame them			0
i am a tall , white , bald @entity139 guy			0
... i am not only funny to look at , but it is hot in that country so i am usually very red when i am photographing			0
... i have tattoos everywhere			0
... they thought i was a quite interesting creature			0
" @entity1 ten @entity0 is a photographer based in @entity217 , @entity218			1
you can follow him on @entity220 , @entity97 and @entity221 .			0

@entity1 ten @entity24 took portraits of refugees at the @entity7 camp in @entity10 , @entity9
he set up a makeshift studio near a hospital , and it quickly became a sensation
