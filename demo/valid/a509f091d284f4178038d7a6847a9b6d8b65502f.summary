@entity5 , @entity6 the @entity4 military is in the process of evacuating about 100 special operations forces members from the @entity11 airbase in @entity6 due to that country 's deteriorating security situation , sources in the region familiar with the situation told @entity7			1
those being evacuated are the last @entity4 troops stationed in the @entity17 nation , which is home to @entity19 , the terrorist group also known as @entity19			2
the @entity4 closed its embassy in @entity5 last month , after @entity22 rebels took over the @entity6 capital			1
and hundreds of @entity19 members escaped two @entity6 prisons thursday and friday , raising further security questions			2
for years , the @entity4 military has worked closely with @entity6 's government to go after @entity19 , together carrying out numerous attacks like the 2011 drone strike that killed prominent @entity19 figure @entity30			1
and @entity4 president @entity31 has hailed this cooperation as a pillar in his anti-terrorism campaign			2
" @entity6 has never been a perfect democracy or a island of stability , " @entity31 said in january , promoting the policy of " partnering and intelligence - sharing with that local government " as the best approach in a bad situation			2
" the alternative would be for us to play whack - a - mole every time there is a terrorist actor inside of any given country , " the president said			0
but while there have been drone strikes as recently as last month , these cooperative efforts have been hampered by @entity6 's growing difficulty in maintaining unity and peace			1
these include the rise of the @entity22 , their battles with forces loyal to ousted president @entity60 and the presence of not only @entity19 fighters but other militants			1
on friday , for instance , @entity64 purportedly claimed responsibility for bombings at two mosques in @entity5 what , if true , would mark that group 's first large - scale attack in @entity6			2
the claim came in a statement posted on a site that previously carried @entity64 proclamations , but could n't be immediately authenticated by @entity7			0
those blasts killed at least 137 people and wounded 357 others , according to @entity6 's state - run @entity78			1
while @entity64 and @entity19 are both @entity80 groups that espouse extreme versions of @entity82 and violent opposition to the @entity84 , that does n't mean they will be working together anytime soon			0
in fact , @entity19 strongly rebuked @entity64 in a video released in november , characterizing its leader @entity89 's declaration of an @entity82 caliphate as illegitimate			0
more than anything , the idea of the group calling itself the @entity93 violently flexing its muscles speaks to the chaotic situation there			0
with no one really in control , that means numerous groups -- including those with a history of killing civilians and lashing out at the @entity84 -- have been more room to operate and a better chance potentially to take over			0
meanwhile , the main players for control of @entity6 's government -- those siding with @entity60 , who still claims to be president after being deposed earlier this year , and the @entity22 , a minority group that 's strongest in the northern part of the country -- remain very much at odds			1
just two days ago , a @entity6 jet commanded by the capital 's @entity22 conquerors fired missiles at a palace housing @entity60 in the port city of @entity122			1
no one was injured , but the direct strike nonetheless marked an escalation in the deadly fighting between the two sides			0
the airstrikes came on the same day opposing @entity6 military forces -- some under the @entity22 , others led by officers loyal to @entity60 -- battled in @entity122 , said @entity122 gov. @entity133			1
at least 13 people died and 21 others were injured in those clashes , according to @entity133			0
@entity60 took to the airwaves of @entity138 , a station he recently started , on saturday in his first televised speech since escaping house arrest			0
he called on all political factions to take part in upcoming talks in the @entity146 capital of @entity147 , condemning the @entity122 strike and urging @entity6 troops to refuse orders from @entity22 officials			1
@entity60 tied the @entity22 to @entity152 , which he was said supported the " coup " that led to his departure from @entity122			2
" the @entity152 agenda of the @entity22 will not last , " he said			0
needless to say , the @entity22 are n't convinced			0
@entity157 , a top member of the @entity158 , said @entity60 's speech wo n't help @entity6 reach a peaceful resolution and accused him of reneging on a deal last september to transfer power			1
" we blame @entity60 for not implementing this deal that drew the road map that would have solved @entity6 's ongoing crises , " @entity157 said			1
" @entity60 will be held responsible for the country 's failures and that chaos that could follow			0
" journalist @entity170 reported from @entity5 , and @entity7 's @entity172 reported and wrote from @entity173 .			0
