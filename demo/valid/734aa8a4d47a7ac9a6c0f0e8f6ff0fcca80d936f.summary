@entity2 fans are used to seeing thousand - dollar price tags attached to the rapper 's @entity5 sneakers when they 're put up for sale on @entity8 , but the auction site is now being overrun by sellers offering up plastic bags full of air allegedly captured at @entity14 's concerts			1
the gag started friday when one ambitious seller attempted to sell a @entity19 bag with " air from @entity21 , " with 90 bidders driving the price tag to over $ 60,000 , the @entity15 reports			1
while that auction was ultimately pulled from the auction site , @entity8 has since been flooded with similar auctions promising air bagged from a @entity29 show , even though the copycats lacked certificates of authenticity proving the air -- likely carbon dioxide -- was grabbed at a @entity14 concert			1
@entity8 has apparently stopped trying to swat down the new " bagged air " auctions , so buyer beware at this point			0
@entity0 : @entity2 reveals new album title the bagged air gag has inspired a rash of similar items like " ziplock bag of air from @entity47 concert " and " @entity48 , " with the latter tagged with a $ 4,999 opening bid			2
another seller is pushing a bag of " flatulence from @entity2 " for the buy it now price of $ 5			0
@entity0 : watch @entity2 's speech on racism at @entity59 honors in other @entity8 news , following the soft launch of his @entity63 , his first footwear collaboration with @entity65 , pairs of those sneakers are now littered throughout the site with prices ranging from $ 1,700 to $ 5,000			2
those asking prices come in direct conflict of what @entity2 hopes to achieve with his new sneakers , as he recently told @entity73 that he hoped his @entity74 would be " super-inexpensive " so that everyone could afford them			0
