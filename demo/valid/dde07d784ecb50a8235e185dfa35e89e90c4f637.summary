@entity0 has @entity2 , while much of @entity3 is painted @entity4			2
@entity5 is playing in @entity6 come september			2
even increases the odds of a good night 's sleep , while @entity9 is in harmony with scaled - down budgets			1
and then there 's the vibrant @entity13 and a new venue , @entity15 , soon arriving in @entity16			1
these statements begin to make sense once you realize that they 're all the names of modern hotel brands			1
according to @entity23 , a professor at the @entity24 , hotels traditionally have been named after an owner or a place			2
but more recently , he says , " the naming process has evolved from an off - the - cuff process into something far more systematic			2
" so what 's behind this influx of idiosyncratic hotel names , replete with misspellings and unexpected word usages ? look to millennials and psychographics -- the study of personality , attitudes , interests and lifestyles			1
psychologists say the millennial psychographic is made up of independent - minded , adventurous individuals in search of new experiences			1
hospitality brands are crafting their marketing strategies accordingly			1
" hotel companies are lazering in on consumer needs by using psychographic data in a big way , " says @entity50 , @entity51 's vice president for insight , strategy and innovation			1
the explosion of social media also has a starring role in the name game			2
brands of the 21st century need to have handles that resonate in the global , online world , say the pros			0
" thanks to social media , millennials are the first global generation , " says dr. @entity67 , academic chair of @entity69 's @entity68			1
" and since this generation is so enamored with texting and tweeting , hotels really have to think how names will play in the new media world			1
" for social media purposes , the number of characters in a name counts			0
spelling is often sacrificed in the quest for brevity			0
but another reason for purposeful misspellings may be legal			1
spelling is often set into an uncommon form to retain meaning while being trademarkable			0
" the odder the name , the less likely someone has already captured it , " says @entity24 professor @entity87 " that 's important in terms of intellectual property protection			1
" it may explain why @entity15 and @entity95 are missing an " e. " @entity15 is a just - announced lifestyle brand , launching its first property in @entity16 in 2017			1
according to parent company @entity101 , it 's designed to give travelers " the freedom to write their own story , their own narrative , to build their own scene			2
" best @entity109 's new hotel entry , called @entity95 , is pronounced " vibe			1
" " we tried to come up with names that celebrated individuality , while also connoting a vibrant spirit , " says @entity111 , a partner at @entity113 - based @entity112 , a branding firm brought in to hone the name and the image			2
hence @entity95 , which is derived from " vibrant			1
" color also plays a big part in hotel branding			1
" we incorporated a bright persimmon red in the design and the logo , in order to reflect the ( @entity95 ) brand 's bold personality , " says @entity111			1
@entity2 , the new @entity51 partnership with @entity130 , is going after " a sassy , determined , individualistic consumer , " according to @entity51 's @entity50			2
the first @entity132 opened at @entity0 's @entity133 in september and more are coming in @entity3 this year			2
" naming @entity2 was a four - month process involving a great deal of brainstorming , " says @entity50			0
" once we came up with it , we knew we had a name with emotional resonance that hit a global sweet spot			0
" at the same time , though , our lawyers noted the name had to be ' ownable and trademarkable			0
' " the change of spelling from moxie to @entity132 achieved that			0
according to @entity50 , senior creative director @entity147 selected hot pink for the @entity132 logo to " appeal to those who are n't afraid to express themselves " while using a " curved font to convey a sense of rhythm , fluidity and independence			0
" color is also key to hotel operator @entity158 , which is hueing ( sic ) toward @entity160 and @entity161			2
@entity161 came about in 2009 , after airline @entity162 withdrew from a partnership with @entity162			0
after the split , @entity162 , a collection of @entity3 design hotels , needed a new name			0
" we wanted to replace @entity162 with an equally short name , " says @entity168 , vice president of branding for the @entity158			0
" we liked using blue from the old @entity162 logo , because it brought in the heritage of the former brand			0
" at the same time , we were looking for a word with positive worldwide connotations ... and blue is the world 's favorite color			1
" so blue or bleu became @entity161 , a trademarkable spelling			0
@entity158 recently announced a new @entity160 brand that will , according to @entity184 , " build on the @entity186 concept and further leverage @entity162 's brand awareness			1
" new brands are also being dubbed with what may seem to be random nouns			0
but there 's nothing random about them			2
last year , @entity195 ( @entity195 ) rolled out even , a new brand cultivated for the growing wellness - minded audience , with two properties in the @entity200			0
@entity201 expresses the desire for the balance travelers are seeking , says an @entity195 spokesperson			0
in its logo , specific colors were chosen to represent elements of nature			0
the four vertical bars of the logo are off - kilter , while the even letters are composed on a flat horizontal line , representing the brand promise of helping guests stay in balance			0
@entity218 - based @entity217 provides " five - star beds at a one - star price			0
" the group has more than 40 properties worldwide , including five in @entity223			0
some in its management group were previously senior executives in the music business			0
it makes sense , then , that a travel company with a musical name would attempt to strike a global chord			0
adding to the medley of avant garde brands , @entity235 's @entity234 's @entity6 hotel @entity5 will open in september , with others scheduled to follow			1
according to @entity234 , coming @entity5 in the @entity240 properties will be " hip and happening hotels " that " move to the rhythm of today 's curious global traveler " who has a " desire to embrace authentic experiences in a city hotel			1
" you ca n't explore the hospitality industry 's desire to appeal to the millennial mindset without nodding to @entity253 by @entity254			1
the brand now seems to have been ahead of its time with hotels that opened in pre-social media 1998			2
" @entity254 was the first hotel company to look directly at the customer as it evolved a new brand , " says @entity259 , global brand leader of @entity260 , @entity261 and the @entity254			1
@entity253 's target customer was a fashionable , high - energy individual -- someone who 'd now likely be described as having a millennial psychographic			1
@entity254 defined the brand by adding its " whatever , whenever " tagline to the simple @entity253 logo			1
@entity24 's @entity23 says @entity254 further imbued the brand with meaning by using words like witty , warm and welcoming in its advertising and marketing material			1
more than 15 years later , the @entity253 brand has more than 70 properties open or in development worldwide			1

from @entity186 to @entity95 , the latest crop of hotel names features misspellings and unexpected word usage
it 's part of the hospitality industry 's aim to target millennial psychographic and trademark their names
@entity253 by @entity254 was among the *pioneers* of this strategy , opening its first hotel in 1998
