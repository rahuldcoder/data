for years , they 've wanted six seasons and a movie , and at 3:01 a.m. et tuesday , fans got it ... almost			1
there 's no movie yet , but " @entity9 's " much - awaited sixth season made its debut			1
not even cancellation by @entity11 could kill the fan favorite sitcom , as @entity14 streamed the first two episodes of the new season early tuesday			1
the show appears to have suffered no decline in quality in the move to @entity14 , though cast member @entity21 ( now on @entity23 ' " @entity22 " ) had to leave the show for family reasons			1
the premiere briefly touches on this in its own way , with @entity30 's absence sounding a lot like the setup for a spinoff ( as the character @entity34 points out , along with several other inconsistencies throughout the episode )			2
the " new @entity30 , " as @entity41 joked , is @entity38 's @entity37 , who exists to play the disapproving authority figure to antagonize the former study group			0
soon , the group was running a @entity44 bar before they could learn to live with @entity37			0
and how about the end of the first episode , which gave us a look at the spinoff , " @entity50 and the @entity51 , " with @entity30 and @entity52 as a @entity54 lawyer ? episode two got even more out there , with @entity58 's adventures in 1990s - style virtual reality and a less - successful plotline involving @entity62 's parents			0
most interesting was the introduction of @entity65 as ' 90s tech genius @entity66			0
critics praised the show , with the @entity71 's @entity70 saying , " everything fans loved about @entity9 remains -- the first two episodes are chock - full of increasingly bizarre pop - culture references ( @entity75 , anyone ? ) and meta commentary			1
the show has seamlessly transferred to an online venue			0
" @entity81 's @entity80 also liked it ( despite some reservations about the plot ) , writing , " the first thing that matters is if the latest reboot still has the comedy goods , and it does			2
" soon after the show went online , devoted fans on @entity88 had their say .			0

the fan favorite comedy " @entity9 " *returns* for a sixth season on @entity14
the series is just as *weirdly* *hilarious* as ever , with *surprises* in store
critics and fans loved the premiere
