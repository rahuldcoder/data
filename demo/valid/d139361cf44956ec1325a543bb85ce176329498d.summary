@entity1 @entity0 knew his son was n't going to make it			1
but the father of three told his wife he could n't stay by 8 - year - old @entity8 's side			1
the boy 's body was torn apart by an explosion near the finish line of the @entity13			1
his skin had changed color			1
a crowd hovered over him , frantically trying to help , but he was dying			1
speaking from the witness stand at @entity19 's trial on thursday , @entity0 told jurors he was faced with a heartbreaking choice			1
" i knew in my head that i needed to act quickly , or we might not only lose @entity8 , " he said			1
" we might lose @entity24 , too			1
" moments after the blast , @entity0 had stumbled toward @entity24 , his 7 - year - old daughter			1
his pants and sneakers were torn apart			2
his legs felt like they were on fire			1
and the air smelled " vile , " he said , like gunpowder , sulfur and burned hair			2
but he soon realized the situation was much worse for his daughter			1
" she tried to get up and she fell			2
that was when i noticed her leg , " he said			2
" she did n't have it			1
" so @entity0 left one son to die near the marathon finish line , and shielded his other son 's eyes from the carnage as they raced to the hospital , hoping that doctors could save his daughter 's life			2
" it was , " @entity0 said thursday , " the last time i saw my son alive -- barely			2
" @entity0 's description of the explosion 's horrifying aftermath capped a day of dramatic testimony as survivors shared their stories in the second day of the high - profile trial			1
@entity19 's attorneys admit that he carried out the 2013 attacks , which killed three people and injured more than 260 others at the marathon			2
a fourth person , an @entity66 police officer , was ambushed and killed in his patrol car three days after the bombings as @entity19 and his brother , @entity69 , allegedly ran from police			1
@entity71 , 26 , was killed after a gunbattle with police			2
and now , his younger brother sits in court facing 30 federal charges related to the bombings			1
his attorneys say he was influenced by his slain brother to participate in the attacks			2
they argued thursday that now is n't the right time for jurors to hear the string of harrowing stories from survivors of the explosions , arguing that testimony should be part of a later phase of the trial , when jurors will decide what penalty @entity19 should face			1
but the judge sided with prosecutors , who argued the testimony was necessary to support their indictment			2
on thursday , jurors relived the moments after the marathon bombings through the eyes of some of the people most affected by the blasts			1
defense attorneys did n't ask them any questions			1
@entity106 was suspicious as soon as he noticed a black backpack on the ground near the finish line			1
" i thought it was weird , " he said thursday			2
" if you are at the airport , if you see any unattended luggage , you notify authorities			2
" but this was @entity1 , he thought , where stuff like that does n't happen			1
still , he told a friend they should move			2
an explosion came two seconds later			2
" i saw a flash , heard like three pops and i was on the ground , " @entity106 said from the witness stand thursday			1
" at first i opened my eyes and saw the sky			2
the first thought was , that was a big firework			2
" @entity106 's ears were ringing , and everything was muffled , but he heard the screams			1
the first bomb had exploded			2
" i looked down and saw my legs , and it was pure carnage , " he told jurors			1
" i could see my bone			0
" @entity106 testified about becoming aware of his injuries -- burns , wounds on his back , and his legs			1
" i knew my legs were gone			1
i know that instantly , " he said			0
he kept repeating to himself , " this is messed up , this is messed up , this is messed up			0
" then the second explosion			0
" we are under attack , " he thought to himself			1
all he wanted to do was call his mom			0
when @entity1 police officer @entity152 saw people running by , screaming , she ran against the grain , toward @entity155 , the last leg on the marathon route			0
one of the first victims @entity152 came across was @entity159 , a graduate student at @entity160			0
@entity159 was vomiting profusely , @entity152 recalled thursday			0
others were already performing cpr on her , and the officer attempted to clear @entity159 's airway			0
" i smelled the residue of smoke , " @entity152 said			0
" smelled like fireworks , cannons			0
" paramedics arrived , and eventually told @entity152 the young woman was not going to make it and they had to move on to other people			0
@entity159 became one of the three fatalities at the scene			0
it smelled like gunpowder , @entity176 told the jury , and " kind of felt like we were underwater			0
" @entity176 's wife -- who was pregnant -- was running the race			0
he found her uninjured , but hysterical from the explosions and ensuing chaos , he said			0
there were powder marks on her jacket			0
@entity176 , a high school football coach , then went searching for his 11 - year - old son , @entity189			1
a figure covered in black soot and hair standing straight up caught @entity176 's eye , and he knew it was @entity189 , he testified			0
his son 's left thigh was cratered , mangled flesh and blood , @entity176 said			0
" it was like something you 'd see in a war movie , " he said			0
" his eyebrows were singed and his hair was sticking straight up			0
" another of thursday 's witnesses , @entity207 , also referred to it as something out of a movie			0
before she hit the ground from the blast , she said , it registered in her mind that she had lost her leg			1
" when i looked down , my leg was tucked under me , but blood was pouring out , " she told jurors			0
in front of her lay a socked foot			0
she started thinking -- did i wear socks today ? she decided she had n't worn socks that day			1
it was someone else 's foot			0
" it was almost like i was starring in a horror movie , " she said , " as was everybody else around me			0
" doctors had to amputate her leg below the knee			0
traveling from the marathon finish line to the hospital , @entity0 went from one terrifying scene to another			0
" you know it 's not going to be good when you see the look of horror on doctors ' faces , " he told the court thursday			0
" @entity24 was devastatingly injured			0
" doctors amputated her left leg below the knee and removed more than 20 shrapnel pieces from her body , he said			0
@entity0 soon learned that , as he 'd feared , @entity8 did n't survive the bombing			1
his wife , @entity250 , was also hospitalized after the attack			1
she lost sight in one eye			1
the father said his own injuries were much less severe than the wounds many other victims suffered			1
the ringing in his ears never stops , and he lost some of his hearing			1
but @entity0 said he could still hear the lawyer questioning him at thursday 's trial			1
he can still hear music			0
and the most important thing			0
" i can still hear , " he said , " the beautiful voices of my family			0
" â€‹ @entity2 's @entity269 reported from @entity1			0
