@entity0 eight minutes of sheer terror			2
that 's what police officers from @entity5 , @entity6 , described in heart - stopping detail monday , revealing details of a chaotic shootout with the @entity13 bombing suspects			1
one of the suspects , @entity15 , died from injuries he sustained that day -- wounded in a gun battle , then run over by his brother , @entity18			1
@entity19 managed to escape , but was later caught by police			1
now he 's on trial , facing 30 charges for the marathon bombings , which killed three people and injured more than 260 others			2
the shootout with police in the early morning hours of april 19 , 2013 , marked one of the most dramatic chapters in the manhunt for the suspects who paralyzed the @entity0 metropolitan area for days			1
it started , patrolman @entity34 testified , soon after he locked eyes with @entity15 , who he spotted driving an suv that matched a description of a stolen vehicle			2
it was n't long before @entity15 and @entity19 were firing guns , throwing bombs and trying to run officers over with a stolen suv , @entity34 said			1
" @entity15 got out of the driver 's side door and began shooting at my cruiser , " @entity34 said			2
soon , the officer said he ran out of bullets			2
sgt. @entity49 saw what looked like muzzle flashes as soon as he arrived at the scene			2
" i put my vehicle in park , i took a round through the windshield , i was sprayed with glass and i knew , ok , we were being fired on , " said sgt. @entity53			0
then the two brothers began throwing improvised explosives , including pipe bombs and a pressure cooker bomb , the officers testified			1
" i noticed one was bigger than the other , and they had different styles when they were throwing the devices , " @entity53 said			0
" one was throwing like a baseball			0
" @entity53 said the pressure cooker bomb " was incredibly loud			1
i had to holster my weapon			0
my eyes were shaking violently in my head			0
" @entity49 said he opened fire when he saw one of the men , @entity15 , charging toward him			1
@entity49 fired and the man threw his pistol at the officer , hitting him in the bicep			1
and with @entity15 , who was wounded from gunfire , on the ground , the three officers tried to put him in handcuffs			1
they thought they 'd be able to arrest him			1
" we were wrestling with @entity15 , and all of a sudden i could hear an engine revving , " @entity34 said the suv , @entity34 said , was heading straight toward the officers			1
the dramatic descriptions of the shootout monday sounded like a scene from a @entity95 film , said @entity97 columnist @entity96			0
but the most extraordinary revelation in court , he said , was that the night could have ended very differently			0
" @entity19 did not have to go back and run his brother over			1
he actually did a three - point turn and reversed the vehicle			0
he could have sped off and run away , " @entity96 told @entity1 's " the lead with @entity104			1
" he was in a much better position to flee			0
but apparently he decided to do a u-turn and come back			0
" the sight of the stolen suv speeding toward them caught the officers by surprise			1
" i reached down and i grabbed @entity15 by the back of the belt and tried to drag him out of the street so he would n't be hit , " @entity49 said			0
" the black suv , it was right in my face			0
... i kind of laid back and felt the wind from the vehicle as it went by			0
" but they did n't move @entity120 in time			0
his body became hung up in the rear wheels and he was dragged a short distance , @entity49 said			0
the prosecutor asked @entity49 if there was something in the road that forced the @entity115 driver to go directly at the officers			1
" no , " he said			0
" it was accelerating at a very high rate of speed			0
" later that day , @entity15 was pronounced dead at a local hospital , with the cause listed as " traumatic injuries " to the head and torso			0
his fingerprints led to the identification of the suspects			2
officers discovered that @entity142 , a @entity143 officer , had been hit by friendly fire during the shootout			2
he survived , but nearly bled to death			0
@entity19 was arrested about 8:45 p.m. that same day , hiding in a boat called the " @entity148 " that was stowed in a backyard in @entity5			1
jurors saw photos of the boat last week			1
but on monday , they got a chance to see the boat , which has become a key piece of evidence in the trial , in person			2
before the trial started , prosecutors and defense attorneys had sparred over how much of the boat jurors would get to see			1
the prosecution sought to remove a panel on which @entity15 allegedly scrawled incriminating messages so that jurors could see it with their own eyes			2
defense attorney @entity166 argued that cutting out a panel would take the written words out of context and would n't fairly reflect @entity15 's state of mind			0
in @entity0 , about a mile from the courthouse , jurors intently looked at the entire boat monday			1
it had been loaded onto a semi truck and moved to the location for viewing by the jury			0
@entity19 , wearing a dark jacket and no handcuffs or shackles , watched the jurors but showed little emotion or expression			1
jurors appeared to strain to make out the words @entity15 scrawled inside the boat			1
the boat was riddled with more than 100 bullet holes -- some of which punctured @entity15 's words			2
@entity192 and @entity193 wrote the story in @entity195			0
@entity1 's @entity104 and @entity196 contributed to this report .			0

3 police officers described an intense gun battle with @entity13 bomb suspects
they said the 2 men shot at them , threw bombs and tried to run them over
