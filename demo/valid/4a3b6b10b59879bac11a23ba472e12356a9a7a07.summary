@entity2 @entity0 needs more women as spies -- and it could do worse than look to recruit them on popular parenting website @entity5			1
that 's according to a report released thursday by @entity10 's @entity9			1
the report recommends targeting women , including mothers and those who are middle - aged or mid-career , to help break through " the permafrost " of men in middle management " who have a very traditional male mentality and outlook			1
" the idea that a new cohort of @entity0 spies could be signed up via @entity5 , more usually associated with debates on pregnancy , childcare and homemaking , may surprise some			1
but lawmaker @entity28 , a committee member , said recruiting more women to the three intelligence and security agencies the committee oversees is a crucial way to change the intelligence agencies ' sometimes hidebound culture			1
the current setup fosters " a management culture which rewards those who speak the loudest or are aggressive in pursuing their career and does not fully recognise the value of a more consultative , collaborative approach , " she said			0
but women 's life experience and other qualities should not be overlooked , she said			2
in a sign of the changing times , the latest film iteration of @entity0 spy @entity47 has had a female boss -- " m , " played by @entity51			2
but while women currently make up about 37 % of the employees across the @entity0 intelligence agencies , according to the @entity9 report , they make up fewer than one - fifth of those in senior roles			1
the recruiting idea has met with some amusement in the @entity5 community			2
" if they need someone whose special skill is getting melted chocolate down her dog - haired jumper and not noticing , i 'm their woman , " posts one @entity5 user			2
" i would love to be a spy			0
and no one would suspect me			0
i am too boring and frumpy , " writes another			0
a third , more skeptical , comments : " yes , people who ca n't help but type their every passing thought into an online forum would make great spies			0
" besides using women - focused outlets like @entity5 to reach a new pool of talent , the committee recommends certain steps to make working for @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 ( @entity86 ) more tempting for women			1
these include offering better career management , encouraging women to set up their own informal support networks and not limiting their options if they have children			0
" women who have successfully been filling operational roles must n't be sidelined after they have children			0
they still have the first class skills that the @entity98 helped them to build , so these should be used , " @entity28 said			0
former @entity100 secretary of state @entity99 -- who similarly looked into the position of women in the @entity103 -- backed the @entity0 report and what it said about the value of women in the intelligence agencies			1
" diversity should be pursued -- not just on legal or ethical grounds , important as these are in their own right -- but because it will result in a better response to the range of threats that threaten national security , " she said .			0

more women are needed to change the culture of @entity0 's intelligence agencies , report says
@entity5 , an online parenting forum , could be used to reach a new pool of talent , it *suggests*
