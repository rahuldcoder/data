@entity2 , @entity3 the @entity3 woman is dragged onto a roof and hit with a stick , as a horde of angry , screaming men swarm around her			1
at one point , video shows her standing with her face covered in blood			0
she is pushed and falls over , and her beating continues with feet , with rocks , with boards			2
then , in the last part of the video , her body is engulfed in flames -- though it 's not known whether , by that point , she was already dead			2
this horrific scene played out in @entity2 on thursday			0
it 's already had ripple effects , including a @entity26 statement on friday condemning what it called " the brutal killing and burning of a 27 - year - old mentally ill woman			1
" that corresponds with what the woman 's parents told @entity4 affiliate @entity35 , saying their daughter suffered from mental health problems for the last 16 years			1
it 's not known whether her attackers knew this , or that it would have mattered			2
what motivated the mob , according to witnesses , was a belief that the targeted woman had burned the @entity47			1
@entity4 has n't seen any proof that she set a copy ablaze			0
@entity3 's @entity51 has found no such evidence , either , according to @entity35			1
@entity53 , acting head of the @entity26 @entity3 mission , said that burning the @entity47 hurts efforts to promote " understanding and mutual respect between cultures and religions			1
" " however , the brutal murder of this woman is an unspeakably horrendous act , " @entity53 said , " that should result in those responsible being prosecuted , to the fullest extent possible , under @entity3 law			2
" @entity67 , a 45 - year - old woman who goes only by one name , told @entity4 what she saw and heard outside the @entity71 shrine , which is opposite a mosque by the same name			2
a group of women were shouting at the eventual victim , accusing her of burning the @entity47 , according to @entity67			1
this got the attention of men nearby			0
police tried to close gates to keep them out but it did n't work , said the witness , noting that many men jumped a fence and began beating the accused woman			1
the hits and kicks ended after someone poured fuel on the woman and lit her on fire , said @entity67 , who watched from inside the shrine			2
" ( they ) burned her and then threw her corpse away in the @entity97 , " she said			0
as of saturday , 11 people had been arrested in connection with the woman 's death , according to @entity103 spokesman @entity102			1
@entity102 said that the investigation is ongoing			0
president @entity105 ordered two investigations related to the case -- one into the beating itself and another including religious scholars			0
his government is " committed to protecting and safeguarding all @entity116 values , " including prohibitions on burning the @entity47 ( if that is , indeed , what this woman did )			1
that 's a responsibility of the nation 's security and legal system , @entity105 said , not of individual @entity3			0
" no individual is allowed to make oneself a judge and use violence to punish others in degrading manners , " the president said			0
" launching personal trials and choosing who to punish stands in clear contradiction to @entity132 and @entity116 justice			0
" @entity4 's @entity134 reported from @entity2 , and @entity4 's @entity135 wrote this story from @entity137 .			0

11 have been arrested in woman 's beating , government spokesman says
she was accused of burning the @entity47 , though there 's no evidence yet she did
her parents say their daughter suffered from mental illness for years
