and , apparently , without chagrin			0
but a year since the annexation of @entity6 , what does that mean for the @entity8 's ability to deal with him regarding @entity10 ? in february 2014 , " little green men " -- the @entity10 term for professional soldiers wearing @entity17 combat fatigues but no identifying insignia -- seized key installations and checkpoints around @entity6			1
the @entity17 president 's website reported the following exchange at a march 4 , 2014 , news conference : question : " the people who were blocking the @entity10 army units in @entity6 were wearing uniforms that strongly resembled the @entity17 army uniform			1
were those @entity17 soldiers , @entity17 military ? " @entity0 : " why do n't you take a look at the post-soviet states ? there are many uniforms there that are similar			1
you can go to a store and buy any kind of uniform			0
" question : " but were they @entity17 soldiers or not ? " @entity0 : " those were local self - defense units			1
" within weeks , @entity0 admitted they were @entity17 troops			1
at the same news conference , @entity0 said he saw no possibility of @entity6 joining @entity17 and said @entity47 would do nothing to " provoke " that			1
two weeks later , he presided as the @entity17 parliament passed legislation annexing @entity6			1
in a documentary shown on @entity17 television last sunday , @entity0 said he gave the order to take @entity6 on february 23 , 2014			1
so , it is clear that @entity0 can and does lie			0
but with that in mind , how should @entity57 leaders who must deal with him actually do so ? first of all , they should bear in mind @entity63 's " trust but verify " dictum			0
second , while @entity0 may play fast and loose with the truth , he appears to be a rational actor who calculates costs and benefits			0
the challenge for the @entity8 is to structure agreements so that it remains in his interest to observe them			0
take the @entity73 , which limits @entity75 and @entity17 strategic forces to no more than 1,550 deployed strategic warheads on 700 deployed missiles and bombers			1
the agreement requires data exchanges , notifications and on - site inspections			0
the @entity17 might be able to cheat a little , but not in a way that would give them a militarily significant edge without the @entity75 having time to react			1
and the @entity86 has incentives to observe the treaty			0
if @entity17 violated it , the @entity75 could relatively quickly add 1,000 strategic nuclear warheads to its deployed ballistic missile force			2
the @entity75 government concluded last summer that @entity17 violated a 1987 treaty by testing a banned intermediate - range ground - launched cruise missile			2
as far as is publicly known , @entity47 has not taken the more serious step of deploying the missile			0
@entity97 now seeks to persuade @entity17 to come back into full compliance and has threatened a variety of costs , including possible military countermeasures -- on top of the opprobrium of @entity17 's @entity105 and @entity106 neighbors , who would be targeted by such a missile			2
( it could reach little , if any , of the @entity75			0
) the costs of noncompliance for @entity47 could be significant			0
the question now topping the agenda is whether the @entity8 can trust any @entity17 promises regarding a settlement to the conflict in eastern @entity10			2
sadly , the track record offers little encouragement			0
@entity17 effectively did nothing to implement the first @entity120 ceasefire , which was agreed to last september			1
it did not withdraw its military equipment or secure the @entity10 - @entity17 border			2
the @entity120 ceasefire reached in february fared little better at the outset			1
a @entity86 spokesman dismissed the idea that @entity17 was a party to the agreement -- even though @entity17 's ambassador signed it			2
@entity17 forces backed those of the separatists attacking the @entity10 town of @entity134 in the first days after the ceasefire supposedly had begun			1
( @entity0 's continual denials that @entity17 troops are in eastern @entity10 have zero credibility after the @entity6 case			1
) since then , the ceasefire seems to have taken better hold , though it remains fragile at best			0
at the same time , concern has grown that the port city of @entity144 could be the next separatist / @entity17 target			2
what can the @entity8 do to stabilize the ceasefire ? an assault on @entity144 ( or elsewhere in eastern @entity10 ) would probably trigger severe costs in the form of a new round of @entity57 economic sanctions on @entity17 and the provision to @entity10 of greater military assistance , including defensive arms			1
as @entity158 and @entity159 recently suggested in the @entity160 , the @entity75 and @entity157 should tell the @entity17 now what costs would be imposed if there is an assault on @entity144 , in order to help deter such an attack			0
the @entity8 may not be able to trust @entity0 on the ceasefire in eastern @entity10			0
but it can do more to raise the potential costs and affect his calculation , and hopefully dissuade him from further military action that would probably bring down the entire @entity120 agreement .			0

@entity17 annexed @entity6 in march 2014
