as an offensive guard for the @entity2 , @entity0 already has a lot on his plate			2
he regularly goes head to head with the top defensive players in the @entity9 and does his best to keep quarterback @entity10 out of harm 's way			1
but besides his endeavors on the field , @entity0 also keeps up another demanding pursuit that is rarely associated with @entity9 players : mathematical research			1
not content with the respect of the locker room , he also seeks the esteem of top mathematicians around the globe			2
" i have a @entity24 's and master 's in mathematics , all with a 4.0 , and numerous published papers in major mathematical journals , " @entity0 wrote in a recent article for @entity23			1
his latest contribution to the mathematical realm was a paper for the @entity33 with the impressively esoteric title , " a @entity35 for computing the @entity36			0
" @entity0 , 23 , makes no effort to hide his unusual combination of talents : his official @entity41 handle is @ @entity42			0
as word of his double life spread on social media in recent days , users responded with fascination and admiration			0
" you are my goddamn hero ( football fan and aspiring complex / functional analyst here ) , " tweeted @entity49 , who describes himself as a math ph.d. student			1
but @entity0 acknowledges that he has faced questions from @entity9 officials , journalists , fans and fellow mathematicians about why he runs the risk of potential brain injury from playing football when he has " a bright career ahead of me in mathematics			1
" after every season , he says in the @entity68 ' @entity23 article , his mother tries to discourage him from continuing to play football			1
the @entity71 graduate says the reason he keeps going is n't for the money ( he drives a used @entity74 and lives on less than $ 25,000 a year ) or " for some social status associated with being an elite athlete			0
" it 's simpler than that			0
" i play because i love the game			1
i love hitting people , " he writes			1
" there 's a rush you get when you go out on the field , lay everything on the line and physically dominate the player across from you			1
" " this is a feeling i 'm ( for lack of a better word ) addicted to , and i 'm hard - pressed to find anywhere else , " he explains			0
he shared his thoughts after @entity94 linebacker @entity93 announced last week that he was retiring from professional football at age 24 because he was worried about the long - term effects of head trauma			2
@entity0 says he envies @entity99 but does n't feel able to quit			0
" when i go too long without physical contact i 'm not a pleasant person to be around , " he writes			0
" this is why , every offseason , i train in kickboxing and wrestling in addition to my lifting , running and position - specific drill work			0
" and as if two areas of overachievement were n't enough , there is one other thing at which @entity0 excels			0
" i 'm also an avid chess player , " he says			2
" and i have aspirations of eventually being a titled player one day			2

the @entity9 player has published numerous papers in major math journals
he keeps playing football despite the risk of potential brain injury
" i play because i love the game . i love hitting people , " he says
