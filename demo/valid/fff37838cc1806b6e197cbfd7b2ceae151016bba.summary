any accident raises questions , and the @entity8 is sending people to @entity11 's @entity10 to investigate			1
although the cause of the crash is not yet clear , officials will no doubt be looking at the conditions on the runway			1
was it cleared and ready ? did the pilot have all relevant information ? @entity2 aviation analyst @entity20 breaks down the responsibilities around runways			2
" there are a couple of things that airports have to do , " she said			0
" the airport has to go out and measure whether the airport runways have friction , meaning when those tires touch down that they will have some contact with the runway			2
" that information is then relayed to the air traffic control tower , according to @entity20			0
" as to whether the runways are slippery , that is breaking action , and the airport gets that from the reports of previous pilots , " she said			1
@entity42 and @entity44 executive director @entity43 told reporters that the runway in question had been plowed shortly before the incident			1
pilots on previous planes reported " good braking action , " he said			1
just minutes after the @entity1 plane landed , all of @entity55 shut down to air traffic			0

" one pilot might say , ' oh that was no problem , ' but he might have learned how to fly in northern @entity76			0

the @entity8 is sending people to @entity11 's @entity10 to investigate
