@entity0 captive @entity3 pilot @entity2 has sent a stark message to @entity6 president @entity5 as she awaits trial in a @entity9 jail			1
in a letter from prison , written in response to questions from @entity1 , she said : " if @entity5 wants to defeat @entity3 -- let 's try to defeat me first ! " " but if he wants peace and friendship between our nations as he claims , " she added , " i am ready to make the first step towards it			1
" my freedom will be that first step towards peace and understanding in @entity3			1
" @entity2 has been held by the @entity6 authorities in pre-trial detention since last june			1
her defiant message was written after @entity1 submitted a series of questions to the @entity3 fighter pilot through one of her lawyers , @entity31			1
we do not know under what circumstances @entity2 answered the questions , but @entity31 says she wrote the responses on friday as he was visiting her			1
@entity2 undertook a hunger strike for 83 days to protest her detention despite pleas from her family and her lawyers			1
she recently abandoned her fast after nearing death but has since resumed it , only drinking broth and milk occasionally to stay alive			0
@entity6 claims the 33 - year - old is behind the killings of two @entity6 journalists hit by mortar fire at a checkpoint in eastern @entity3 , allegations she has always denied			2
@entity9 says she then crossed voluntarily into @entity6 and sought asylum as a refugee			2
the @entity3 government , however , insists she was kidnapped by rebel forces and that she is a prisoner of war			2
" i have already been in captivity for an hour when those @entity6 journalists died			0
i have not seen them , and our ways have never crossed			0
. the ' rebels ' themselves told me that those journalists came under fire of their own ' makhnovtsi ' [ slang for ' anarchists ' ] , " @entity2 told @entity1 in her letter from jail			1
" and the investigators knew all about it since the very beginning ! and they have nothing on me ! they simply thought that it would be easy to " twist my arms " and receive another star for their epaulettes			0
but it 's not going to happen ! " she added			0
@entity2 's case has attracted wide international attention and turned her into a symbol of resistance against @entity6 in her home country , with @entity3 's president @entity85 awarding her the title " @entity89 , " one of the nation 's highest honors			1
she has also been voted into the @entity3 parliament despite her captivity			2
despite her critical situation , @entity2 appears to have retained her sense of humor just as much as her determination , writing that she was feeling " on the edge ! ... ; ) close to @entity97 and enlightenment ! ; ) joking			2
" " holding on ! but holding my body entirely on my the power of my will , " she continued , " because i am so numb that i could n't feel the needle when the blood sample was taken from my vein today			0
" tottering , head is spinning , [ blood ] pressure 80x40 , [ blood ] sugar 2.9 , @entity106 [ temperature ] -- 35.7 Â° @entity108 but still be standing till 50kg [ body weight ] ! even longer if @entity115 let 's me ! has n't fainted even once and has n't fallen off my feet			0
" the military pilot told @entity1 she is being monitored " 24 hours a day , " which she finds " very annoying			0
" " protection and security measures are such that @entity120 would not have been able to break away ! ; ) , " she joked again			0
" but in general all is very decent and polite ! treatment is reasonable			0
" @entity2 's lawyer recently told @entity1 's @entity124 in an interview that president @entity5 holds @entity2 's fate and that she wanted to await trial out of jail			1
several international dignitaries have urged @entity9 to release her , including @entity132 foreign policy chief @entity131 and the @entity133 , to no avail			2
but as @entity2 continues her hunger strike , is she willing to ultimately die in detention ? " to die ? ! that 's not our methods ! ! ! ; ) i 'll think of something better ! ... : ; ) , " she said			1
" i 'll be on hunger strike as i said until i am returned back to @entity3 , or at least [ until ] detention is changed to a house arrest at the @entity145 in @entity146 , which is actually a part of @entity3 in @entity6			1
" there is no point starting eating in prison			0
the bite does n't go down the throat here in this cage ! and the truth must win after all ! ! ! " @entity1 reached out to @entity6 authorities for an update on @entity2 's case , who referred us to their last statement on @entity2 , dated from 20 february , where they call on the media to " let the investigators to finish their job			2
let the court of justice to determine @entity2 's degree of guilt of and punishment for the crimes she is charged with			0
" @entity2 is currently scheduled to appear in court on may 13 .			0
