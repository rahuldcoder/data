more than two decades as a judge , prosecutor and defense lawyer could not prepare @entity4 for the @entity6 murder trial of millionaire @entity7			1
the aftermath of the sensational 2003 trial of the scion of a @entity12 real estate empire in many ways upended the life of the 54 - year - old @entity16 - born lawyer who presided over the case			1
@entity7 admitted at trial that he killed neighbor @entity19 in @entity16 and chopped up the body			1
there was the awkward encounter with @entity7 in an upscale @entity24 mall in 2005			1
@entity7 had already been acquitted after his attorneys argued that he killed @entity19 in self - defense			1
or the time , month 's later , when the severed head of a cat was left near the doorstep of @entity31 ' home			1
@entity31 said she believes @entity7 was behind it but admits police found no evidence			1
fearing for her life , @entity31 said she stashed handguns throughout her house in case of a home intrusion			1
she put away the butcher knives in her kitchen			1
there was the strange instant message that she said brought @entity48 agents and surveillance cameras to her home			2
" i 've been living with this , " the former judge said in an interview friday			1
" it 's affected me in many , many ways			1
" the emotions came rushing back when @entity7 -- the focus of @entity59 's true crime documentary series " @entity60 " -- was charged with first - degree murder this week in the 2000 killing of his longtime confidante , @entity63			1
@entity7 's lawyer has denied his client was involved in @entity63 's death			1
" everything he does is totally unexpected , " she said			2
@entity7 , 71 , appeared to be preparing for life on the run when @entity48 agents arrested him in a @entity72 hotel on saturday			1
in his room , agents found more than $ 40,000 in cash , a handgun , marijuana and a neck - to - head latex mask to alter his appearance			1
he 's being held on drug and weapons charges in @entity82 as he awaits extradition to @entity84			2
the last time @entity7 was accused of murder was in @entity16			1
though he was acquitted in the death of his neighbor , @entity7 later served nine months in prison on felony weapons charges stemming from that case			1
days before christmas 2005 , @entity31 ran into the man whose real estate developer family is among @entity12 's wealthiest at @entity24 's the galleria mall			2
@entity7 , who was on parole at the time , was on his cellphone			1
he had his head down			2
" i was glad because i could get my composure , " @entity31 recalled			2
it was the first time @entity31 had seen @entity7 outside court , " in the free world , " as she put it			1
" i needed to not show any fear , " she remembered thinking			2
" i got my poker face on			2
" " hey , i know you , " she said @entity7 told her			1
he appeared startled and dropped his phone			2
fumbling to pick up the pieces of his phone , @entity7 said , " you 're judge @entity31			1
i did not recognize you without the robe , " she recalled			2
" how are you doing , @entity111			2
" @entity7 told her that he could n't believe she stopped to talk to him			1
" i have a job to do but it 's not personal			2
" there was small talk about cases @entity7 's lawyers were working			1
" i thought , ' @entity119 , how do i get out of this ? how do i exit , ' " said @entity31 , who then wished @entity7 a happy holiday			1
@entity7 said he was impressed that she had stopped to chat			1
" he seemed genuinely touched , " @entity31 said			2
she turned around and walked away			2
she wanted to look back at him but did n't want to seem concerned			2
" i started calling my mom and staff and my friends -- you 're not going to believe who i saw ? they said i should call security			2
for what ? to tell them he 's shopping			2
" the galleria mall was not listed on the places @entity7 could go during his parole , said @entity31 , who was a witness at a subsequent parole hearing			1
the former judge said police officers told her that @entity7 had also been spotted outside the home where @entity19 was killed			1
a secretary in the district attorney 's office saw @entity7 driving behind the @entity16 courthouse , @entity31 said			1
a condition of @entity7 's parole was that he could only visit places where his parole officer permitted him , @entity31 said			1
his parole was not revoked			2
when court officials called @entity7 's lawyer @entity151 to inquire about his presence near the courthouse , the lawyer said his client was visiting a psychiatrist in the area			1
@entity151 could not be reached friday for comment about what @entity31 said about his client			2
" there could be no good reason to come back to these places , " @entity31 said			2
she started to become concerned			2
in " @entity60 , " @entity7 described the time he spent living in @entity164 with his first wife , @entity165 , running a health food store in the 1970s			1
in 1982 , @entity167 went missing			2
@entity7 said he last saw her when he dropped her off at a train station in @entity169 , @entity12 , and she headed to their @entity171 apartment			1
her family said they believe she 's dead and that @entity7 is to blame			1
the case has never been solved			1
@entity7 has denied any involvement in her disappearance			1
" it 's a nightmare watching it unfold because you could see that justice is n't going to be done , " @entity31 said of the @entity7 case and its many tentacles			1
one day in june 2006 , @entity31 said , that nightmare arrived on a walkway just feet from the doorstep of her home			2
" it was part of severed cat and it had been cut right behind the shoulders , " @entity31 said			0
" so it had the head and it had the two front legs			0
it was a small , pretty little gray cat			0
it was placed very carefully			0
it was n't just tossed			0
it was very neatly laid there			0
this had obviously had been killed somewhere else and brought here			0
" the animal 's head was perfectly severed			0
" what was the key piece of evidence in our case that was n't there that would have given no doubt whatsoever that this was not self - defense -- the severed head , " @entity31 said , referring to @entity19 , whose dismembered body was recovered but not his head			1
@entity31 thought of the two dachshunds she had at home			0
she checked and the dogs were fine			0
" i was in a panic , " she recalled			0
" i was just distraught			0
" the police were contacted			0
even the @entity16 police chief arrived at the scene , @entity31 said			0
a veterinarian determined that the cat had been killed by a person			0
forensic tests found no dna under the claws			0
there was no evidence linking @entity7 to the incident			1
" they thought i was paranoid and crazy , that i was overreacting , " @entity31 said			0
@entity238 said he was part of the investigation but declined to comment further			0
in an email to the @entity242 , head of the @entity243 , @entity31 talked about getting blinds for her windows and cameras for the courthouse			0
she recommended getting the door locks fixed			0
@entity0 obtained a copy of the email			0
" his message is he knows where i live ( and ) this is what he is capable of , " she wrote			0
@entity31 said she thought about evidence at the murder trial			1
the medical examiner testified that the person who dismembered @entity19 knew exactly what tools cut through muscle and bone			0
then the judge started receiving instant messages from unknown senders			1
one said , " did you like your package ? " @entity31 contacted the @entity48 , which , she said , for nine months had cameras set up around her home			0
@entity31 said agents determined the message was sent from @entity273			0
they found no link to @entity7			1
the agent involved in the case did not return requests for comment			1
@entity31 started carrying a gun			0
her parents always reminded her to keep her doors locked			0
" there was a period of time after that where i not only did carry a gun , i had guns and weapons hidden throughout my home , " she said			0
" what if he breaks in and the gun is at the other end of the house ? people did think i was crazy			0
" she hid the butcher knives in her breadbox			0
" if something happen , i 'd know where they were , " she said			0
" i lived like that			0
i believe that somebody really bad came to my home to send a message to me			0
" @entity31 ' obsession with the @entity7 case is such that she has been working on a book she wants to title " @entity310			1
" the final chapter keeps changing			0
" every time you think you 've reached the highest level of weirdness , we go again , " @entity31 said			0
she knows more than she needs to know about @entity7 and his peculiarities : how he used to prepare for court sessions in the holding cell doing naked jumping jacks			1
how whenever he 's arrested , officers find guns , drugs and stacks of @entity326			0
she learned the reason for the last item from listening to 32 hours of @entity7 's recorded jailhouse phone calls			1
" this man , his day , every day of his life , is defined as a success or not a success by how going and doing no. 2 went , " she said			0
" that was a part of the conversations with him ... it had to happen at a certain time of day or his whole day was shot			0
the court staff used to joke that rearranging the court schedule was going to upset @entity111 's schedule			0
" a few years back , while @entity31 was campaigning for re-election and working the polls , a man approached her			0
@entity31 said it was a juror from the @entity7 trial , a man who had befriended the defendant , visited him in jail and dined with him at times			1
he must have seen a media report about the severed cat head			0
" it seemed like he 's inappropriately happy to be asking me this question -- ' hey , did anything ever happen about that cat head at your house ? ' " @entity31 recalled			0
" i 'm thinking to myself : you son of a bitch			0
i know the police were n't doing anything about it			0
i said , ' oh yes , the police think they know who did			0
his demeanor changed and he could n't get away fast enough			0
