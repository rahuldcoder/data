the @entity0 , which is the largest sponsor of @entity2 troops in the @entity3 , says the church has strong measures in place to prevent the sexual abuse of scouts , as claims have been made it has n't done enough			1
in the first interview about allegations of abuse in @entity17 church - sponsored scouting troops , @entity11 told @entity4 that the church is at the forefront for prevention of child abuse			1
" we feel like there is really no other organization that we know of -- a church or something like a church -- that does as much as we do , " @entity11 said			1
" we have a zero tolerance policy or position with respect to child abuse , and we train our people , we teach our people , we work with leaders , we provide materials online and in hard copy			1
" over several months , @entity4 examined allegations of abuse that were detailed in at least five lawsuits filed against the church and the scouts			1
but @entity11 said the church today is proactive , even constructing its buildings " in such a way as to try to avoid any situation where child abuse could occur			1
" " for instance , if you walk down the hallway in an @entity0 chapel , a @entity17 church , and look at the sunday school classes , you 're going to see windows in the doorways into those sunday school classes so people can look inside and walk by , " he said			1
the interview with @entity11 followed a @entity4 investigation into the case of @entity59 , who was sexually abused by his scoutmaster , a member of the @entity0 , beginning when he was 14 years old in 1998 , according to the lawsuit @entity59 filed against the church and the @entity63			1
the scoutmaster , @entity64 , had been forced in resign from scouting in the early 1990s after reports surfaced that he failed to report a fellow scoutmaster who was engaged in homosexual activities			2
that scoutmaster ended up going to prison for sexual assaults on minors			2
@entity64 's name was added to the @entity63 's ineligible volunteer files , which are widely known as the " perversion files			2
" the documents , which were made public in 2012 , are lists of scout leaders suspected of sexual abuse or homosexual activity			1
however , three years after being kicked out of scouting , @entity64 was allowed to rejoin the scouts after getting letters of recommendation attesting to his character			0
one of those letters was from @entity64 's influential mormon bishop @entity87 , who wrote that @entity64 was " highly respected and liked			0
" @entity88 , who is now retired , declined to speak to @entity4			1
but in a deposition taken as part of the lawsuit last year , he acknowledged that he would not have written the letter knowing what he later found out about @entity64			0
the lawsuit charged that @entity64 " actively groomed young boys under his charge for later sexual molestation			0
" @entity64 eventually was convicted of molesting @entity59			0
he is now in prison for violating probation in the @entity59 case			0
@entity102 , who is @entity59 's lawyer , said what happened in the case is outrageous			0
" this case is probably the most egregious of all of the cases against the @entity0 church , and the reason i say that is because the @entity0 church knew that @entity64 , this pedophile , was already kicked out of scouting by the @entity63 , " @entity102 said			1
however , church attorney @entity112 said it was the @entity63 organization that should have done something			1
" if the @entity63 had disclosed to @entity88 the information they had in their files , there is no way that @entity64 would have ever become a scoutmaster , and he would have been subject to excommunication by the church , " @entity112 said			1
in a statement to @entity4 , the @entity63 said @entity64 was removed from scouting " for reasons unrelated to child abuse			1
" the group added , " our efforts to protect youth were plainly insufficient , inappropriate or wrong			0
we extend our deepest apologies to victims and their families			0
" read the full response from the @entity63 the case ended last year with a confidential settlement paid to @entity59 , who is now 31			0
all but one of the five lawsuits filed against the church and @entity63 have been settled			1
@entity64 was sentenced to probation in 2000 after pleading guilty to indecently assaulting @entity59			0
while on probation , he was arrested for possession of child pornography and was sentenced in 2012 to 15 to 30 years in prison			2
" any case is alarming to me			0
it 's a tragedy , " @entity11 said			0
" i 'm a father			0
i have seven children , four boys and three girls			0
the thought of one of them as a child or youth being abused is absolutely horrific to me			2
" asked what he would say to @entity59 , @entity11 said , " i say to him and anyone else who has been abused in the church or other churches -- i 'm sorry that you 've gone through what you 've gone through			2
it 's a horrible thing for anyone to be abused			0
no child , no youth should ever have to go through that			2
