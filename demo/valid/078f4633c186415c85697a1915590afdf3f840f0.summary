stylists , a fashion commentator and a luxury - brand exec are speaking out about a movement that sneers at @entity5 's implicit deal : gratis gowns in exchange for money or mentions			1
not surprisingly , fashion designers providing free couture dresses do n't exactly feel the same way			1
" because it has now become a thing where people spend months and make five dresses for them , " @entity12 has said			2
" if you wear one of those dresses and a company has invested hundreds of thousands of dollars or has paid you , then yeah , you say who it is			1
" in other words , ladies who look like a million bucks ( and have been paid that much or more from deals with brands like @entity27 or @entity28 ) ca n't expect not to be asked about what they 're wearing			0
@entity31 supports # @entity32 : " it 's hard being a woman in @entity5 " notes @entity5 stylist @entity38 of awards - season red carpets : " these women in many cases are being paid a great deal of money to wear these dresses			1
is this the venue to get into baby seals or save the @entity46 ? i 'm not sure it fits			0
" one vice president of a major @entity51 fashion house asks : " if you asked these actresses straight out , ' which is more important to you , the money you 're paid to wear these dresses or talking about issues ? ' they 'd take the money any time , believe me			1
" is red carpet coverage sexist ? battle lines drawn at @entity61 over # @entity32 stylist @entity62 suggests a two - pronged response : " how about ask her both ? feminism and turning it out on the carpet should n't be mutually exclusive			1
there needed to be a backlash to mani - cams and , to be honest , there could be some better journalism from fashion experts			0
" outgoing fashion police host @entity73 agrees : " any actress can choose to steer the conversation			0
the worst [ media ] can do is nervously cut to commercial			0
i support any movement that gives women increased power from where their only recourse was just to wear @entity84 and smile			2
men , however , should be asked exclusively about their penis size			0
" the @entity5 reporter 's 25 most powerful stylists of 2015 what do you think celebs should do ? Â© 2015 the @entity5 reporter			2

@entity31 was among the actresses at the @entity61 who called for red carpet *interviewers* to # @entity32
while red carpet fashion is a big draw for awards , women in @entity5 say they want to talk about more than their gowns
however , in many cases stars are paid to wear and *promote* the designer dresses . can they do both ?
