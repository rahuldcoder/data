@entity0 used to be a place where we said , " @entity4			1
" we live by a credo that " freedom is n't free , " and that our @entity7 is worth dying for			1
how inspirational it is to believe that this is the wind of thought that blows underneath the @entity13 's wings			1
unfortunately , whenever that wind becomes just a little too gusty for comfort , we find out just how little relationship our poetic credo has to our collective guts			1
the latest example : nine seconds of video of a number of boys singing an offensive song			1
immediately , the @entity24 expelled two of the boys for their speech			1
forget whether you like the speech or not			1
these boys got kicked out of a public school for singing a song , on their own time , in a privately rented bus , simply because the government did n't like the content of their song			1
opinion : what 's the right way to face racism ? censors overstepping their bounds is no surprise			1
what surprises me is how readily the public supported the expulsions , and how many supposedly intelligent people were willing to turn the @entity52 on its head , because of nine seconds of video			1
i do n't like the song or its message either			1
i ca n't imagine anyone reasonable who would			1
but i want to live in a country where the government does not listen to my songs and then decide whether or not i should be punished , based on what words i used			2
i understand that most of us hate racism			2
we are on a mission to eradicate it from all corners			2
but i am not willing to trade the @entity52 for a society where we do n't need to hear racist words			1
in @entity72 , justice @entity71 wrote a passage that ultimately became the cornerstone of a liberty - based view toward free speech , and which became the dominant theory in @entity52 jurisprudence			1
in @entity72 , @entity71 gave us " the marketplace of ideas			2
" and what a brilliant theory it was			2
@entity71 noted that if someone was completely confident in the belief that they were right , then it would seem logical that they would want to suppress dissenting views			2
" if you have no doubt of your premises or your power , and want a certain result with all your heart , you naturally express your wishes in law , and sweep away all opposition			2
" those who wish to eradicate racism are certain that they are right			2
i believe in a racism - free world			1
i have marched in counterprotests against the @entity105			2
i 've stood up in places you do n't want to be , against violent neo-nazis			2
and i would do it again			2
but i feel no kinship with anyone who would harm the @entity52 to fight racism			1
some things are worse than racism -- like a loss of the right to speak your mind and think your own thoughts			0
unfortunately , that is a price that too many of us are willing to pay			0
as certain as i am that my views on race are correct , i can not shake @entity71 ' wisdom from my mind			0
he wrote : " but when men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths , they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas -- that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market , and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out			1
that , at any rate , is the theory of our @entity7			0
" for that reason , i would gladly protest against the @entity105 , but i would never abide any government official denying the @entity105 its right to speak			0
i understand those who would wish to do so			0
they want to eradicate racism , and the end will justify the means			0
however , we have slowly been descending into a place where we are trading this for freedoms that are far more precious than the freedom to avoid having our feelings hurt by offensive statements			0
of course , some say that these were more than " offensive			0
" the song was a " threat			1
" after all , it did mention lynching black people			0
but was that really a threat ? an idiotic ditty in an all - white bus ? to call it a threat is disingenuous			0
what about the disruptive nature of the song ? should other students have to go to school with people who clearly despise them , and who carry these offensive racist thoughts ? yes			1
they should be free to have these thoughts , they should be free to say these things			1
if it crosses the line into action , or even imminent incitement to action , that 's another story			0
in this case , that never happened			0
opinion : the danger society does n't talk about it is easy to claim that these @entity202 boys did not deserve @entity52 protection			1
but , when you hear that , your immediate reaction should be one of skepticism			0
the @entity52 is not there to serve as a comforting blanket of civility			1
in fact , it is there precisely to protect the sharp edges			0
it is there for the @entity105 , the @entity218 , @entity202 , and you alike			0
it is there for words that shock us , challenge us , and that bother us			0
you should want to protect the @entity202 boys -- not that they deserve it			0
you should do so because the day will come that your speech is unpopular			0
once , speech in favor of racial equality was considered to be " bad speech			0
" once , professors were kicked off campus for not being " anti-gay enough			0
" but , today , the thought of equality and tolerance have won out in the marketplace			0
let that victory stand , without trying to cement it with the force of law , and without destroying the very liberty that allowed these " good thoughts " to flourish in the first place .			0

@entity253 : those willing to *weaken* @entity52 should realize their free expression is also at risk
