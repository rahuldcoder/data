robots serve you drinks , you can skydive on deck and a mechanical arm hoists you 300 feet into the air to view the ship			1
you could be forgiven for thinking you had been transported into the future on board the new $ 1 billion cruise ship @entity10			1
as its name suggests , it is very much a quantum leap in boat building			2
the latest brainchild of @entity17 , which has branded the newest member of its fleet the " smartest cruise ship in history , " it is basically a fun palace on the high seas			1
everything , it seems , is a first : the first bumper cars , skydive simulator and bionic bar on a ship			1
and among the 19 restaurants on board , there is something for everyone			2
those of a literary slant can even dine at @entity39 , with waitresses dressed up in characters from the novel by @entity43			2
such are the maverick creations on board from bow to stern , it is a vessel befitting of the @entity48			2
" this is the smartest cruise ship , " says @entity49 , executive vice-president of maritime at @entity17 and head of the design process behind the project			1
" this is probably going to be a big change for the industry and the future			0
" and this is not just @entity17 's prediction			1
" it 's unique and unusual , and we just had fun -- pure and simple , " is the assessment of @entity62 , the editor of @entity63 , after spending eight days on @entity64			1
" @entity17 are always raising the bar when it comes to putting stuff on board you 'd never thought you 'd see on a cruise ship			1
" they just do things well before anyone else and their ships are traditionally the ones you get most excited about , " adds @entity74 , who estimates she has been on 300 cruises as part of her job			0
" you keep on thinking when they come up with something crazy they 've hit the wall and there ca n't be anything new , but there always is			0
they keep doing things no - one else has thought of			0
" there are bigger cruise ships out there : @entity98 and @entity99 -- both part of the @entity17 fleet -- although not quite with the same box of tricks			1
@entity49 likes to think @entity64 has something for everyone -- it even has its own " godmother , " @entity108 actress @entity107			0
but what exactly does a price tag of nearly $ 1 billion buy you ? the vessel is 16 stories high , has room for 4,500 passengers and a 1,500 - strong crew			1
it also boasts 18 decks , 2,090 state rooms , is the length of 41 @entity122 buses and weighs 167,800 tonnes			0
built in @entity124 shipyard in @entity125 , @entity126 , its first voyage at the end of last year was from @entity129 to @entity130 , and an eight - day @entity132 cruise on board starts from $ 1,333			1
the project was first discussed in 2009 and the build took three and a half years			1
@entity136 - born @entity49 , now based in @entity137 , takes great pride in the fact the vessel was delivered just two minutes late			0
@entity49 , who has been with the company since 1995 , is proud of the open - thinking mentality that appears to have gone into the design process			1
" i do n't remember any major elements that we did not get on the ship , " he says			2
" it 's come together nicely			2
we have a group of people that love to innovate and look to the future			0
with this , we started to think about the next generation			0
" when we start a new design , we think of the customer and what can we do			0
we put the customer right in there			0
how can we provide a better vacation ? we constantly explore novel options , what 's possible on a ship			1
we have people pushing innovation that just have that in their dna			0
" that involves bringing partners on board , including the team behind @entity170 by @entity171 -- provider of skydiving on the deck in an enclosed capsule -- which has long been a company aspiration			1
" we 've actively looked at having that on board before the technology was not enclosed and also too noisy , " adds @entity49 , who spent his childhood summers sailing in the @entity136 @entity177			0
" the technology moved on and the energy could be used in a constant loop so there was n't such wasted energy			0
" it was the same for the @entity187 , a capsule -- modeled on the @entity189 -- that gives holiday makers a 360 - degree view of the deck but can also protrude over the side of the boat with just the sea below			2
it is not something for vertigo sufferers			0
" @entity187 looks simple but it 's very complex so adding to the ship design was huge , " explains @entity49 , who says he only got involved in studying naval architecture in order to make him a better yachtsman			1
" some of our best resources were working on that for 18 months before the product was started			0
" at the @entity208 , passengers can order drinks by @entity210 and watch as huge bionic arms make any beverage of their choosing			1
the tech thrills do n't end there : @entity49 claims @entity64 has the most advanced @entity216 on board any ship			2
he says the connectivity , set up by @entity220 , is as fast as logging on at home or at work -- achieved by using a satellite in much lower orbit than would normally be the case			0
" it 's comparable to anything on land , so this is a revolution			2
" the company is confident it is winning the cruise wars , and reviews of the vessel have , to date , been very positive			1
there are , however , rivals			0
@entity74 cites the examples of both @entity237 and @entity238 for their own innovations			0
" @entity240 has this completely nuts rope course on deck 16 with a gang plank which looks down over the sea			2
they were also the first for alternative restaurants and led the way with outdoor spaces and great party areas with bars and restaurants outside , " she says			0
" carnival are doing some fun design work with @entity255 ( launching in 2016 )			0
it 's like a ship within a ship with a separate family zone and a @entity261 - themed area for adults			1
" so @entity17 are leading the way but it 's nice to see it 's got competition			1
" there is a pressure on @entity17 to raise the bar for its next creation , though @entity49 is not concerned			1
" this is about 1 % great idea and 99 % execution , " he says			2
" history tells us that we like to push the envelope and will continue to do that and create very unique experiences			0

@entity10 cost nearly $ 1 billion to build and is billed the world 's smartest cruise ship
robots make your drinks , you can take out a *surfboard* on deck and surf the *web* at speed
the company behind it , @entity17 , believe it is " winning cruise wars "
