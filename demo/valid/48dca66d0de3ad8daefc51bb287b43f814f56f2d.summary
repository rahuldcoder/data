or , if you prefer , @entity2			0
it 's thanks to those 19th - century promoters that the elephant rose to become the circus 's king of beasts -- the living symbol of " @entity12			1
" " this is something that has been a big deal historically , " says circus historian @entity13 , an american studies professor at the @entity14			1
traditionally , she observes , elephants are the stars of the parade when circuses come to town			1
there was even a 19th - century phrase , " to see the elephant , " a euphemism used by soldiers for seeing battle , recognizing the wonder and rarity of these giant animals			1
on thursday , @entity12 , part of the @entity33 firm , announced that it would be ending use of elephants by 2018			1
it 's a startling change for the show , which has made the giant pachyderms a centerpiece of its presentation for decades and weathered criticism for their treatment from animal rights groups			0
@entity45 : @entity12 will soon be without elephants @entity1 was perhaps the first to make elephants a part of the circus atmosphere			1
the modern circus only dates back to around 1770 , the invention of an @entity52 named @entity51 , who added jugglers , acrobats and clowns to his equestrian show			1
( the term " circus " comes from the ancient @entity59 , although the @entity61 version was closer to a sporting event featuring soldiers , and it could be quite bloody			2
) @entity65 's circus was such a huge success that he created one in @entity69 , and his students and acolytes -- knowing a good idea when they saw one -- brought the circus to other cities			2
to this day , the ringmaster wears elegant riding clothes because of the circus ' equestrian roots			2
@entity1 , a shrewd marketer who was also responsible for making the circus a tented traveling show , added a " menagerie " to the event to help combat the form 's sometimes seedy reputation			2
" circuses in this era were really for adults , and not marketed for children at all , " says @entity88			0
@entity1 's show , by adding a menagerie tent to the circus tent , could market their shows as educationally uplifting by " showing people the wonders of the animal world , " she adds			1
by the 1850s , elephants were regular circus attractions			1
in the early 1870s , the clever entrepreneur , who had made his fortune with such acts as the " @entity106 , " singer @entity107 and a @entity109 - based museum of curiosities , created @entity111			0
" they had exotic animals from the four corners of the earth , and you had to go through the menagerie first and then you went to your seat in the big top , " @entity112 , curator of collections for the @entity114 , told @entity115 for a 2010 documentary called " @entity117			0
" " there was no way to miss the menagerie -- it was all part of the educational outreach to get people to go to the show			0
" @entity2 and his partner made the circus an efficient business , running it on the railroad to far - flung destinations and transporting their animals long distances			2
" elephants become this incredibly important signature part of the circus , " says @entity88			1
the beasts were huge attractions			0
when @entity2 announced he was going to bring a white elephant back from @entity146 , a competitor whitewashed his own elephant and engaged in a media war			0
( the clash popularized the term " white elephant			0
" ) another @entity2 purchase , the @entity153 , was the centerpiece of his circus , and when @entity159 died in 1885 , the victim of a train accident , the news made worldwide headlines			2
the attitudes towards elephants , and circus animals in general , started changing in the early 20th century , says @entity88			1
for one thing , until @entity165 , the circus was the king of the entertainment circuit : " there were no movies , radio or television to compete with the wonders of the circus ring and little traffic congestion or parking problems to impede those who sought to attend , " wrote @entity178 in @entity179			1
and in recent decades animal - rights activists have increasingly protested against the use of performing mammals such as elephants and killer whales , demanding better treatment for them			2
@entity12 and other circus companies have dealt with numerous challenges over the last half - century , including ever - splintering attention for entertainment dollars and the rise of acrobat - based shows such as @entity194 , which is now a global empire			1
but " @entity12 " is still hugely popular , and @entity88 believes the loss of elephants wo n't affect the circus ' bottom line			1
still , she says , there is something special about the majestic animals			0
at a show she attended in 2013 , the elephants had their own space , and a bunch of children were standing nearby , watching them in awe			0
" it was very moving , " she says			0
" this physical proximity to these animals is powerful			0
" when it comes to circus animal acts , are more changes to come ? are lions and tigers next ? @entity88 wonders			1
" in a way , the elephant is kind of the bellwether animal			0
i would imagine this is a kind of catalyst , " she says			0
" i would imagine that we have not heard the last of the kind of changes that are afoot in terms of animals and circuses			0

elephants have been symbolic of the circus since the 19th century
@entity12 circus is ending use of elephants soon
historian wonders if more changes are to come
