according to the @entity4 , that 's the human toll from antibiotic - resistant " superbugs " each year in the @entity6			1
to fight the growing problem of infections that ca n't be treated , the administration of president @entity8 is implementing a five - year national action plan at a cost of $ 1.2 billion			1
those funds , part of the president 's 2015 budget , which must still be approved by @entity17 , would nearly double the amount of federal money allocated to the fight			1
the plan calls for creating a " one - health " approach to testing and reporting superbugs around the country , as well as establishing a dna database of resistant bacteria			1
new , rapid tests to detect emerging resistant bacteria will be developed			0
research for new antibiotics and vaccines will accelerate			1
the plan calls for two new options for people , and three for animals , by 2020			1
global surveillance and cooperation is also stressed , including a global database for animals			0
a key goal is to slow the growth and spread of superbugs by reducing the use of antibiotics when they are n't needed			2
the plan calls for a 50 % reduction in inappropriate antibiotic use in doctor 's offices and a 20 % reduction in hospital use by 2020			1
" this is a lofty goal , " said internist and @entity57 associate professor dr. @entity55			0
" it 's important for both patients and professionals to be on board			0
" there are still details to work out			0
" who determines what 's appropriate ? " asked @entity66 pediatrician dr. @entity65			0
" are we going to have a checklist of requirements that have to be met ? i think it might be a bit tough to measure , but i think improvement can definitely happen			0
" a recent survey of 796 health care professionals found 63 % of the sample prescribed antibiotics when they were n't absolutely necessary , at least 10 % of the time			1
a top reason : the patient requested it			2
" some patients put a lot of pressure on doctors to give them an antibiotic , and they may think they 're not getting good care if they 're not given one			2
but that 's just not true , " said @entity55			0
" it 's become like an insurance policy but it 's an insurance policy that does n't give good dividends			0
" " i do find there is a lot of education that has to go on with patients that might expect antibiotics when their child is sick , " said @entity65 , " but i think in recent years i have seen more of an awareness , and many of my patients are more hesitant to ask			2
" another part of the plan pledges to eliminate the widespread use of antibiotics to boost the growth of animals raised for food			1
it will also phase in oversight by veterinarians for other uses of antibiotics in feed and water			2
while applauding the spirit of the pledge , critics say the limits are still too voluntary and limited in scope			0
" the problem we have with the plan is that it only removes the growth claims from the label , " said senior analyst @entity125 at keep @entity126			0
" what we hoped for in the plan was a commitment from @entity135 to identify which antibiotic uses other than growth promotion need to be changed			1
" " with 80 % of the antibiotics produced in the @entity6 being used in agriculture mostly for prevention , " said @entity138 , @entity140 - @entity139 , who has an alternate proposal in front of @entity17 , " any meaningful solution to the looming antibiotic resistance crisis must begin with limits on the farm			1
trusting a voluntary policy that lets industry police itself will not bring about real change			0

antibiotic resistance is a pressing *public* health issue , @entity4 says
plan would nearly double the amount of federal monies allocated to the fight
patient use of *unnecessary* antibiotics will be *curtailed*
