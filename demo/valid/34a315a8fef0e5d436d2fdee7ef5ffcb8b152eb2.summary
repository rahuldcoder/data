@entity1 it was n't supposed to work			0
but @entity4 's @entity3 -- a massive internet surveillance and content control system -- has , in many respects , been an unparalleled success			1
@entity4 has @entity10 companies worth billions of dollars and more web users than the population of the @entity13 -- all while still being able to block information it deems counter to its interests			1
and now , some fear , the model is going global			0
" if you are sitting in @entity26 , what 's the problem ? " asks @entity21 , @entity4 watcher and author of the @entity4 newsletter in the latest episode of " on @entity4			1
" " you are still in power , you have 650 million internet users , you have billions of dollars of economic value going to the @entity10 everyday , you 've used the @entity10 to increase government transparency , investors love us and they ca n't throw enough money at our companies that have more than half a trillion dollars in market capitalization , " says @entity21			1
soon after @entity4 tip - toed onto the internet in the late 1980s , it laid down the foundation of the @entity3 but critics asserted that an internet with @entity46 characteristics would be no internet at all			1
during a high - profile media tour in @entity26 in 1999 , @entity49 founder and technology pundit @entity47 declared that a " healthy disrespect for authority " was required for any successful internet industry			0
a year later , then - @entity13 president @entity54 announced that " liberty will spread by cell phone and cable modem " and that any attempt to control the internet in @entity4 would be " like trying to nail @entity60 to the wall			1
" well folks , it 's now 2015 and @entity4 has done the impossible			2
it 's nailed the @entity65 has proven it can have its @entity3 and enjoy great prosperity too			2
@entity67 , associate professor at the @entity68 and former head of free expression at @entity71 , says that most @entity46 are happy with the status quo			2
" their lives have noticeably improved , " he says			0
" the model has worked so far			0
" currently home to the world 's largest internet market , @entity4 is also home to some of the world 's most valuable @entity10 companies including e-commerce giant @entity83 and @entity84 , now estimated to be worth $ 66.1 billion			1
the government has fostered the development of the internet by offering incentives for local entrepreneurs while building walls to keep big @entity92 rivals out			0
the ban on @entity92 social media sites like @entity95 and @entity96 has also given home court advantage to @entity4 's own @entity10 stars like @entity99 and @entity100			1
and contrary to @entity47 's declaration , respecting the strict rules that govern @entity4 's @entity10 has not gotten in the way of innovation as @entity46 tech developers reinterpret existing business models and build out new mobile apps			1
" i have n't really come across anybody who would say that yes , because we do n't have a free @entity10 , therefore we ca n't innovate , " says @entity21			0
" from @entity26 's perspective , there 's this fear that if we open up the internet then it will be chaos			0
so if the cost is good - enough or almost - good - enough innovation ... it seems like a pretty straight forward equation from the perspective of the policymakers			0
" and there are signs the @entity3 is expanding its reach			0
last week , the @entity46 and @entity125 news websites of @entity127 news agency became inaccessible in @entity4 , joining a number of foreign media destinations that are barred online in @entity4			1
there have been ways to get around it			0
through vpns , or @entity133 , web users in @entity4 can access restricted content			2
but in a recent crackdown , the @entity46 government is shutting down vpns -- @entity26 's latest move to shore up its cyber-authority			2
" you can filter out keywords , you can filter by @entity142 , you can block or poison @entity144 ( domain name system ) , and increasingly now they identify @entity133 , " says @entity67			0
" the problem is that it 's decided on a national level by the government , " he adds			0
" it 's this attitude that ' father knows best			0
' " and that " father " would be @entity151 , the so - called internet czar of @entity4 who was recently photographed smiling at @entity155 's desk during a visit at @entity96 's headquarters in @entity158			1
" @entity151 is really pushing this ' internet sovereignty ' model , where we can control the information , we can control the internet within our borders and we will use our model , " says @entity160 , the @entity161 research director of @entity162			1
" more than that , the @entity46 authorities are pushing this as a model for the globe and they are going to get a lot of acceptance or buy - in from a lot of different countries			2
" @entity162 fears the @entity3 could become the next great export from @entity4			1
" it would be a very attractive model for instance for @entity183 , for @entity184 , or for other states , " @entity160 says			1
" it would be obviously in @entity4 's interest for other people and other nation states to agree with them and their interpretation of internet sovereignty			1
" and instead of backing away , @entity92 onlookers may be nodding their heads in agreement			0
last year , the @entity13 - based @entity195 decided to censor some content on its @entity46 site			2
and fear is mounting that @entity155 's recent charm offensive with @entity151 reflects @entity96 's desire to do whatever it takes to crack the @entity4 market			2
so would global internet users rise up against a @entity96 that censors its posts and monitors its users to comply with local laws in @entity4 ? it 's unlikely , says @entity21			1
" i actually think most users do n't care			0
" " at the end of the day , they 're not going to give up @entity96 because @entity96 is operating differently in @entity4			0
" a facebook that fits the firewall , and fortune at the expense of freedom			0
that is precisely @entity4 's vision of how the @entity10 should be .			1

@entity4 's " @entity3 " is a massive internet surveillance and content control system
critics said it would stifle business but now @entity46 @entity10 companies are worth billions
@entity162 fears @entity4 is exporting its model to places like @entity184 and @entity183
