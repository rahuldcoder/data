@entity0 has slammed as " unacceptable " comments by @entity4 's envoy to @entity0 that joining @entity6 's missile defense shield would make @entity0 warships " targets for @entity4 nuclear missiles			1
" in august last year , @entity0 said that at least one of its frigates would be equipped with a radar that would allow it to contribute to @entity6 's missile defense shield			1
in an opinion article published in the @entity0 newspaper @entity15 on saturday , @entity4 ambassador @entity13 said he did not think the @entity0 fully understood the consequences of joining the missile shield			1
" if this happens , @entity0 warships become targets for @entity4 nuclear missiles , " he wrote			1
@entity0 's minister for foreign affairs @entity20 said @entity13 's remarks were unacceptable			2
" @entity4 knows full well that @entity6 's missile defense is defensive and not targeted at them ( @entity4 ) , " @entity20 said			2
" however , i would not over-dramatize this			0
right now we disagree with @entity4 on many important issues , but we also cooperate , for example , in the @entity27 and it is important that the tone between us does not escalate			0
we certainly are not contributing to that			0
" tensions between @entity4 and @entity6 member countries have been mounting since @entity4 's annexation of @entity34 in 2014 and claims its military has been involved in the ongoing violence in eastern @entity37			1
@entity38 has repeatedly denied its military is involved			0
in april 2014 , @entity6 foreign ministers said they had " decided to suspend all practical civilian and military cooperation between @entity6 and @entity4 " over the issue			2
the @entity43 and @entity6 allies have been conducting military exercises as part of " @entity46 , " which the @entity43 describes as " a demonstration of our continued commitment to the collective security of @entity6 and dedication to the enduring peace and stability in the region , in light of the @entity4 intervention in @entity37 specifically			0
" on march 2 , @entity6 deputy secretary general @entity57 told the alliance 's annual meeting on arms control : " @entity4 's illegal annexation of @entity34 and its continuing destabilization of @entity37 have put the @entity64 security system -- and all the rules and agreements that underpin it -- under severe strain			1
" last monday , state - run @entity4 media reported that @entity4 president @entity70 had ordered his @entity71 " to full alert in a snap combat readiness exercise " in the @entity27			0
at least one @entity4 leader described the drill as routine and unrelated to the " international situation			0
" conversely , deputy foreign minister @entity77 told @entity79 news agency that @entity4 was " deeply concerned " about @entity6 drills near its border			0
@entity6 says the long - term goal of its missile shield is " to merge individual @entity86 ' missile defense assets into a coherent defense system , providing full protection for @entity6 @entity64 populations , territory and forces against ballistic missiles threats			2
" @entity6 has previously asked @entity4 to participate in the system , but negotiations were deadlocked over @entity4 's demand for a legally binding treaty guaranteeing the shield would not be used as a deterrent to @entity38 's own systems .			1
