@entity0 has won 19 grand slam singles tennis titles , including six @entity5 opens and five @entity6			1
she has four olympic gold medals			2
for years , she 's had a reputation as one of her sport 's top players			2
yet for all her myriad accomplishments , @entity0 says one of her " biggest ... and proudest moments " came friday night -- in the second round of a tournament in @entity17 , @entity18			1
it 's not who she was playing , but where			2
the @entity22 is where @entity0 was booed during the 2001 finale			1
her older sister , @entity25 , got similar treatment in the stands , and her father @entity28 told @entity29 he was subjected to racial abuse			1
afterward , @entity0 vowed she 'd never go back			1
she kept true to that promise for 14 years , a time when she often dominated her sport			2
on friday , @entity0 was back			1
and instead of jeers , there were cheers			1
and tears , shed by @entity0 during the crowd 's loud , boisterous , more than minute - long ovation			1
" i knew that i really wanted to do it , " @entity0 said afterward of her return to @entity17			1
" but up until that moment , i did n't really know if it was the right thing for me to do			2
" and i feel like that 's when i felt it was the right thing , " she said of her welcome			2
" ... receiving the love from the crowd here , it really meant a lot to me			2
" the @entity51 in @entity17 , just east of @entity52 , @entity18 , is n't a grand slam but is one of the top tournaments in tennis			1
as such , top players go there to battle the best and prove their mettle			0
that 's what brought @entity0 to @entity17 in 2001			1
the then - 19 - year - old got to the finals after her scheduled semifinal foe -- sister @entity25 -- pulled out minutes before the matching , citing a knee injury			2
amid whispers he 'd predetermined the outcome , @entity67 told @entity29 that he " had trouble holding back tears " given the treatment he got in the stands			0
according to him , one man said , " i wish it was ' 75 , we 'd skin you alive			0
" ( @entity78 , the tournament director at the time , denied any racial abuse in the same story ; @entity1 did n't hear back from him after requesting an interview			0
) @entity0 scored a three - set win over @entity84			1
but she did n't celebrate			0
she spent hours crying in the locker room			0
" ( i drove ) back to @entity87 feeling as if i had lost the biggest game ever -- not a mere tennis game but a bigger fight for equality , " @entity0 wrote in @entity88 in february			1
" emotionally it seemed easier to stay away			0
" @entity0 speaks about nerves before 1st match back at @entity17 the roller - coaster ride back to @entity17 started when @entity0 accepted a wild - card invitation to play in this year 's tournament , a difficult decision she recounted in @entity88			1
her father and sister , @entity25 , still stayed away			2
while she 's been on her sport 's biggest stage for well over a decade , the world 's no. 1 - ranked played admitted being nervous in the weeks , days and hours leading to her opening match			0
those feelings broke out in the open as she walked onto the court , a response she called " overwhelming " and said she " was n't really prepared for			0
" the match itself was n't easy , either			0
@entity112 - born @entity111 , the world 's 68th - ranked player , challenged her for more than two hours			0
still , @entity0 managed to overcome her competitor and her emotions to win in straight sets , 7 - 5 , 7 - 5			1
declining to reflect on the past , @entity0 simply said afterward , " today was a wonderful day for me , for women 's tennis , ... for tennis in general , and for everyone			1
" the 33 - year - old still has a lot of matches ahead of her			0
that includes more at @entity17 , whose talented field includes @entity126 and @entity127			1
still , for all her competitive fire , @entity0 is n't feeling much pressure to win			1
she feels like she has already won			0
" i do n't feel like i actually have to hold the trophy at the end of this , " she said			0
" i feel like i 'm already holding the trophy			0
and i 've never felt this way			0
' i feel like just being here is a huge win , not only for me but for so many people			0
and it 's a wonderful feeling			0
" @entity1 's @entity140 contributed to this report .			0

@entity0 ' father *claimed* he was racially abused at @entity17 in 2001
she returned to the event friday night , being met with *raucous* cheers -- not jeers
