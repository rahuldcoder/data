, he apparently did not anticipate the resulting uproar			0
many of @entity3 's businesses fear that the law could be used to allow store owners to deny service to gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender ( @entity16 ) persons			1
the @entity17 has expressed concern about the @entity19 , which @entity20 is hosting this weekend , and other companies have threatened to move their businesses outside of the state			2
but , when pushed on the issue , @entity2 insisted that the law is " not about discrimination " but instead is " about protecting the religious liberty of every @entity26 of every faith			1
" when asked whether he would allow an amendment to clarify that the law will not preclude anti-discrimination protections , the governor doubled - down , noting that " we 're not going to change this law			1
" but members of the @entity3 legislature beg to differ with the governor , pledging to " fix " @entity3 's @entity4			1
and now , the governor has changed his tune , also calling for a fix to the bill			2
can there really be an easy " fix , " short of repealing the @entity4 ? the answer is , of course , it depends			0
under @entity46 like @entity3 's , people are not free to disobey any law in tension with their religious convictions			1
instead , @entity50 create a standard to balance a person 's religious interests against the governmental policy at stake			0
under @entity3 's @entity4 , the government must show that its policy interest advances a compelling state interest and is the least restrictive means to address the problem at issue			1
the question would then become whether anti-discrimination laws advance a compelling interest in the least restrictive means			0
the answer to that question is easy : yes			0
the adoption of such laws have long been viewed as advancing compelling state interests , and the only way to eliminate discrimination is to ban it , so they are the least restrictive means			1
at present in @entity3 , there is no state - level law that protects @entity16 persons from discrimination by private parties			1
in certain cities and other , local jurisdictions , however , there are ordinances prohibiting such discrimination			0
@entity3 would have two ways to " fix " the @entity4 problem			2
the first would be to adopt state - wide nondiscrimination laws that protect @entity16 persons			0
such an act would confirm that , as a matter of state policy , protecting the lgbt community is viewed as a compelling state interest			2
this would bring @entity3 into alignment with @entity95 , which has a @entity4 , but which also has a comprehensive nondiscrimination statute , ameliorating any concerns about the @entity4 being used in discriminatory fashion			2
given the wishy - washy answer that gov. @entity2 provided when asked whether he thought discrimination against @entity16 persons was appropriate , the likelihood of @entity3 adopting a comprehensive nondiscrimination statute seems remote at best , eliminating this fix as an option			1
another possibility would be to amend the statute to confirm that any federal , state , or local nondiscrimination laws constitute a compelling state interest for the purposes of the @entity4			0
importantly , federal law does not protect @entity16 persons from discrimination by private actors , and neither does @entity3 state law			1
but this language would expressly carve out local ordinances from the scope of the @entity4 , such as the nondiscrimination ordinance in @entity20			0
in essence , this would preserve much of the law as it existed before the @entity4 : absent local nondiscrimination laws , persons are free in @entity3 to discriminate against @entity16 persons on any basis			1
this amendment , however , would make clear that the state - level @entity4 can not be used to trump local city ordinances that protect the lgbt community			0
what are the odds of this second fix ? well , that precise amendment was proposed -- and adopted -- in the @entity137 legislature as it considered a @entity4 comparable to @entity3 's			1
the result : the bill 's sponsors tabled it , noting that the exception for local nondiscrimination laws would " gut " the bill			0
that reaction shines a light on the true motivations for these @entity148			0
if these acts are n't about discrimination , then why would ensuring nondiscrimination protections " gut " the bill ? it 's because these bills truly are about permitting discrimination against the @entity16 community			2
all of the hand - waving by @entity159 and others can not distract from the truth : rfras are the first responses to @entity16 advances .			0

@entity166 : @entity3 's law allows discrimination against the @entity169
he says the state governor and others are using religion act as an excuse
