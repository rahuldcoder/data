@entity0 a report on lab safety at the @entity4 put together by a committee of external experts calls the agency 's commitment to safety " inconsistent and insufficient			1
" the report , which was completed in january but posted on the agency 's website this week , also says " laboratory safety training is inadequate			2
" the report was put together by an external group of 11 experts in biosafety , laboratory science and research			2
in the report , they say they are " very concerned that the @entity4 is on the way to losing credibility			1
" the agency created the advisory group to improve lab safety in july in the wake of two mishaps and other issues that were uncovered through procedural reviews			1
one incident occurred in june when dozens of employees in a bioterrorism lab working with the deadly anthrax virus , were at risk because of a failure to properly follow sterilization techniques			0
the head of that lab resigned after the incident			0
this followed a may incident in which avian influenza samples , thought to not be dangerous , were unintentionally mixed with the deadly @entity46 influenza virus and then shipped to a @entity48 lab. then in december , with the advisory group already working to reduce lab safety risks and improve the culture of safety , employees in the @entity51 lab were potentially exposed to that virus when a technician mistakenly transported the wrong specimens from a high - level lab to a lower - level lab. @entity62 investigations were done after each incident , and various changes were recommended such as cameras being added to some labs and certificates being required to transfer samples from some labs , following the @entity51 incident			1
the four - page report summarizes the groups findings and offers recommendations following visits to @entity4 labs , meetings with @entity4 staff and a survey about the laboratory safety culture at @entity4			1
the report recommends all @entity4 labs go through an external review and accreditation process			1
they suggest the @entity85 for clinical labs and the @entity87 for research labs			0
to that point , the committee says in the report , " the @entity4 must not see itself as special			2
the internal controls and rules that the rest of the world works under also apply to @entity4			0
" other recommendations include : -- funding for lab safety programs and standardized training			0
-- establishing a system of responsible science and accountability			0
-- rewarding researchers who run safe labs			0
-- hiring a director to oversee lab safety			0
in response to the recommendations , @entity4 chief operating officer @entity108 said in a statement , " it 's critical that we continue to solicit feedback on how we can improve our operations , especially functions as critical as lab safety			1
we brought this group of external experts together over the summer to assist us with identifying and implementing solutions , of which many are already underway			2
