i grew up watching " @entity2			1
" most episodes , @entity3 would come home from work in his suit and tie and there would be his wife june , always in the kitchen , her apron as white as the picket fence outside			1
june made dinner , of course , and @entity3 and @entity15 and the @entity16 sat at the table and ate			1
as i recall , june usually cleaned up			1
maybe once or twice the boys helped with dishes			1
i would watch the black and white show during dinner , sitting on the couch with a plate of food on my lap that had not been prepared by my own mother			1
my mother was in her generation 's first cohort of " working moms			1
" she had a successful career as an executive at @entity33 and then @entity34			1
she left for work early each morning , but was always home by five or six -- in time to spend time with me , not to cook			1
my dad also had a full - time job , and across the entirety of my life , i do n't recall him so much as opening a can of soup			1
he 's only recently learned to use the microwave			1
both my parents worked equally hard , but there was no doubt when i was growing up that cooking was my mom 's responsibility -- even if that meant buying prepared meals from the @entity52 , spooning it onto plates , pressing " power " then " start			2
" in other words , as i ate my dinner in the 1980s while watching a tv show based on life in the 1950s , it was easy to see that some things had changed and some had not			2
life inside the house -- food , dishes , cleaning , tidying , clothing , hygiene -- was my mom 's responsibility , just as it was @entity70 's			2
outside the house -- the lawn , the cars , anything made or stored in the garage , sports , bike riding -- that was my dad 's domain			2
and to be clear , when the car would break down , it was a big deal , but one that came up far less frequently than our need for meals and laundry			2
this daily labor weighed more on my mother			2
sociologist @entity87 coined this the " second shift " : how even though more and more women started working outside the home , they were still expected to do the same amount of domestic work at the end of the day			1
studies say that when it comes to fair division of household labor , gay couples , like my partner and i , generally do a better job			2
unfettered by the ready expectations of traditional gender roles , same - sex couples " are more likely than members of heterosexual couples to negotiate a balance between achieving a fair distribution of household labor and accommodating the different interests , skills , and work schedules of particular partners , " wrote social scientist @entity103			2
in fact , after a no - doubt bumpy period of adjustment ( editorializing from personal experience here ) , @entity103 wrote , " this pattern of negotiation holds true even when couples have children living with them			2
" in my own family , my partner does most of the laundry , though to be fair that 's partly because she 's picky about what 's washed on what cycle and what gets hung to dry , versus tossed in the dryer			2
on weekends , she does most of the cooking -- because , she 's a better cook and enjoys it more			2
but i 'm faster , so i end up cooking breakfast and dinner most of the weekdays			0
about 99 % of the time , if our bed is made it 's because @entity140 did it			0
and 99 % of the time , if the dishes are washed , it 's because i washed them			0
@entity140 likes to buy groceries because i have a bad habit of buying massive quantities of things we do n't need			0
and she buys our daughter 's clothing ( same reason )			0
i pay the bills and do our taxes			0
on weekends and after school we take turns ferrying our 6 - year - old to and from activities and play dates			0
what , you 're wondering , about other traditional " male " gender roles in our male-less family ? admittedly , i more often wear pants more than my partner and i more often take on these tasks			0
when our car breaks , i take it to the mechanic			0
i load the car up for trips			0
i put crap in the basement			0
i fix the leaky sink			0
but i also sew my daughter 's @entity176 costume every year and sew on buttons when they fall off			0
our same - sex family has not so much created new gender role arrangements , but deconstructed such arrangements altogether			0
i get to smush millipedes and sew costumes , not because of my chromosomes or some pre-determined gender role , but because i enjoy doing so			0
while i now pay most of our bills online , i find it unbelievably gratifying to put a check in the actual mail			0
i have a giant , eclectic pile of postage stamps for this reason			0
it should be noted that the experience of gender roles is highly defined by class			0
what my partner and i have in common with my parents is the financial ability to have additional help , including , in our case , regular babysitters and a weekly house cleaner			0
what 's more , any conversation about household gender roles would be incomplete without noting that some upper - middle class @entity211 pay their domestic workers so painfully little that these workers -- predominantly immigrant women of color -- ca n't afford to put healthy food on their own families ' tables , if they even have time to cook between cobbling jobs together to make ends meet			1
meanwhile studies show that in working - class straight couples , even where the women work outside the home and the men do n't , women still do a disproportionate amount of housework			1
it seems that in too many situations , no matter the configuration , women are getting screwed			1
this is partly why @entity236 today launched # @entity237 , a public service campaign in partnership with the @entity240 and the @entity241 emphasizing how men benefit from equality and providing practical tips for men to do their part at home and at work			1
the campaign encourages men to " show the world they 're for equality " and women to " celebrate men leaning in for equality " by posting with the hashtag # @entity237			1
@entity257 is not the fault of all men , but it is the responsibility of all men to do something about it			1
after all , whether you want to blame biology or early economic incentives or the cultural indoctrination of " @entity2 , " men have consistently failed to do their fair share of household labor in @entity211			1
the solution ? more gay households or even sister - wife - type scenarios alone wo n't transform household gender roles			0
we have to value household work as work , which means everything from paying domestic workers livable wages to more men cleaning and cooking and teaching their sons that doing so is honorable and equitable , not demeaning			1
while fairness in gender roles has improved since the era of june and @entity3 , the subtle and not - so - subtle inequities are still a mess			0
men need to shift from expecting or enforcing traditional gender roles to becoming role models for more equitable relationships			1
in other words , clean it up , fellas -- literally and figuratively .			0

@entity297 : decades after " @entity2 , " women still shoulder most of housework , *childcare*
she says a new public service push aims to engage men in sharing these jobs , encouraging young men to do the same
