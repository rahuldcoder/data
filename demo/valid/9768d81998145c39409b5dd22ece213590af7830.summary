could a simple blood test someday tell if you 're genetically predisposed to post-traumatic stress disorder ? that 's what a team of international researchers is hoping after finding a genetic marker linked to @entity9 in the blood samples of @entity11 stationed in conflict zones			2
" we 'll draw the blood and have a way to do this very rapidly and start to tease apart who is a little more at risk and who is a little more resilient for @entity9 , " says principal investigator dr. @entity13 of the @entity14			1
" @entity9 can occur after many types of trauma : rape , torture , child abuse , natural disasters and car , plane , and train wrecks , to name a few			2
according to the @entity33 , more than 13 million @entity32 have ptsd and the societal cost is in the billions			1
women are about twice as likely as men to develop the disorder			2
symptoms tend to cluster into three areas : reliving the event via nightmares or vivid images , along with an extreme reaction such as uncontrollable shaking , chills or heart palpitations			0
avoiding reminders of the event , including becoming emotionally withdrawn and detached from friends , family and everyday activities			0
being hyperaroused , easily startled , irritable , angry , or having difficulty sleeping or concentrating			0
as one might expect , service members are hardest hit			0
the @entity54 estimates 30 % of all @entity56 vets have experienced @entity9			1
among troops recently deployed to @entity58 and @entity59 , @entity9 can run as high as 20 % in any given year			1
but why does severe emotional trauma trigger ptsd in some people and not others ? the idea that your genes play a role in whether you develop ptsd is a popular focus of recent research			1
scientists have discovered genes that help regulate fear reactions in mice			2
the lack of a fear - regulating brain chemical called gastrin - releasing peptide led to greater fear response among the rodents			0
in another study , mice without a protein necessary to form " fear memories " were less likely to freeze up and more willing to explore unknown spaces			0
studies of twins show heredity accounts for about 30 % of the differences in response to trauma , with identical twins much more likely to both develop ptsd than fraternal twins			1
other research has looked into the role of inherited brain differences , mental disorders , or addictive tendencies			2
an unusual avenue of research is how our immune systems may contribute to the development of ptsd symptoms			1
prior studies of people diagnosed with @entity9 compared to control groups without the disorder suggest differences in genes related to inflammation may play a role			1
" the body is built to keep us alive and it functions as one big system , " says @entity13 , discussing the interface between stress and immune chemicals			1
" the systems all talk to each other			0
" the recent study , published in the journal @entity120 , is unique because it compares blood samples from 188 @entity11 taken before and after they were deployed to combat zones			0
another group of 96 @entity11 was also studied to verify the results			0
" under this experimental design , not only can we identify differences between @entity32 @entity11 with ptsd and without , but we can go back in time , so to speak , to see if any of the @entity11 who eventually developed ptsd " showed evidence that it would emerge , says the study 's co-senior author , @entity130			1
" in this vein , we are able to start labeling findings as being putatively ' causal ' in nature			0
" in the blood of @entity11 ultimately diagnosed with @entity9 , the study found biomarkers associated with gene networks that regulate innate immune function -- the body 's first line of defense -- and interferon , a protein responsible for kicking the immune system into action			1
in addition , this hypervigilant immune response occurred before and after exposure to trauma			2
" why do certain people start out with slightly higher immune response and others have less ? is it somehow just built in or have they been exposed to some kind of pathogen ? " asks @entity13			2
instead of pathogens , another possible explanation is that the inflammatory response is activated by the stress of going off to war			0
" you could try to dampen down the activation and see if that improves symptoms or prevents development of @entity9 , " says @entity13			0
@entity13 stresses these questions are purely hypothetical at this time and that the study needs to be replicated and expanded			0
" we 're early in the process of having some clues as to what might predict risk and resilience , and with more research we 'll begin to have effective preventions and treatments , " says @entity13 .			1

more than 13 million @entity32 have ptsd
genes account for about 30 % of risk
immune system plays a role in risk and resilience
