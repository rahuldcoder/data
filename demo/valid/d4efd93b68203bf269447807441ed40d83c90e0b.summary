for the second time in his career , @entity0 , @entity1 , police officer @entity2 is being investigated for using lethal force			1
but the cases and their circumstances are different , very different			1
friday 's death of @entity10 , an unarmed biracial 19 - year - old , has made @entity0 the latest epicenter of protests of black males killed by white officers			1
eight years ago , it was a different story			2
@entity2 shot and killed a man who pointed a pellet gun at him			1
he was exonerated of any wrongdoing and received a commendation			1
the dead man was white			2
it started as a 911 call			2
the caller reported a man with a gun on his front porch			2
what the dispatcher did n't know was the man that @entity30 was talking about was himself			2
three officers rushed to the scene , including @entity2			1
they knew they were facing a potentially life - threatening situation			2
they were unaware that @entity30 's ex-wife , @entity35 , was also calling 911			2
" my ex-husband is sitting outside and i think he just called 911 , " she said			2
" he 's got a pellet gun ... he 's drunk			2
" as she talked to the dispatcher , the squad cars arrived outside			2
" i think he called you because he wants to end his drunkenness , " @entity30 said			0
" i hear the sirens coming			0
it 's not a real gun			0
i think he wants to be taken away			0
" the officers never learned that the weapon @entity30 pointed at them was a pellet gun			0
the call with that information came 40 seconds before they arrived			0
investigators ruled the shooting a " suicide by cop			0
" for his handling of the incident , @entity2 was awarded the medal of valor , the department 's highest honor			1
last week 's shooting has n't earned commendations			1
it 's polarized a community			0
because @entity10 did not have a weapon , his death spurred memories of other unarmed black men killed by police : @entity75 in @entity76 , @entity77			0
@entity78 in @entity79 , @entity80			0
over the weekend , protesters filled streets in @entity0			0
on monday , demonstrators packed the @entity84			0
they chanted and carried a banner with a familiar message : " black lives matter			0
" the incident started friday night when authorities got a call that a black male was yelling and jumping in front of cars , madison police chief @entity88 said			0
when @entity2 went to the apartment where the report came from , he heard some commotion and forced his way in , @entity88 said			1
" once inside the home the subject involved in this incident -- the same one allegedly out in traffic and that had battered someone -- assaulted my officer , " @entity88 said			1
after that , according to the chief , " the officer did draw his revolver and subsequently shot the subject			1
" @entity2 has been placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation			1
" it 's a stressful period for him and his family , but he also understands that a family here has suffered a tragic loss and he understands that there has to be an investigation , " said @entity112 , executive director of the @entity113			1
under @entity1 law , officer - involved shootings are investigated by an outside agency , in this case the @entity125			1
once the division completes its investigation , the report will go to the local district attorney , @entity88 said			1
@entity112 declined to comment on the ongoing investigation , but said there are some circumstances when an unarmed person could still be seen as posing a deadly threat to a police officer			1
" the real fear for any officer when he 's being attacked , generally speaking , is that their weapon will be taken away , " @entity112 said , " and an unarmed individual can become armed very quickly			1
" concern is a word often used by the police chief as the investigation continues			1
@entity2 , 45 , is a 12 - year veteran of the @entity149			1
@entity88 calls him " a very conscientious dedicated public servant , " but acknowledges that a second shooting in eight - year 's time is , well , concerning			0
" any loss of life is very tragic , " the chief said			0
" @entity156 is concerning for anyone			0
we are concerned for him and the community			0
" and the community is looking for its concerns to be addressed			0
