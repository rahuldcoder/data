on october 24 , 1944 , @entity1 warplanes swarmed at the @entity3 of battleships , @entity6 's @entity5 , splashing down torpedoes or dive bombing it			1
it took them four hours and more than 25 direct hits to put one of the two largest war ships in @entity14 to the bottom of the @entity17 ' @entity16			1
this month , @entity19 co-founder @entity18 and a team of researchers found a sprawling undersea wreck after an eight - year search for the @entity5			1
@entity6 maritime expert @entity24 is 90 % sure they found the right ship after the first images were published earlier in march			1
and that 's a breakthrough			2
" i have heard countless stories in the past that the ship was discovered , but they all turned out not to be true , " @entity24 said			0
unfortunately , @entity6 war ships did not bear their names on their sides , so a full identification takes a while			1
but the wreckage matched the ship 's description , and it had a mount for the @entity42 seal , a chrysanthemum which was made out of teak and rotted away in the ship 's 70 years in the sea			2
on thursday , @entity18 's team treated the world to a live tour from the wreck at nearly 4,000 feet under the waves			1
an unmanned vehicle 's spotlights lit up the pitch darkness , revealing crisp high definition images of massive rusted iron in crystal clear turquoise water			2
the live tour began with one of the @entity5 's many death blows -- a warped bow			1
" what we see here is torpedo damage , " said @entity62 , the expedition 's leader			2
torpedoes usually punctured the hull and exploded inside the ship , belling the metal outward			0
the remote operated vehicle puttered past more fatal damage , as @entity74 and his team described it			2
a big dent pushing inward , he explained , was likely from a torpedo that barely missed the ship , exploding outside the hull , pushing it in			0
" it 's the concussive force next to the ship , " he said			2
the submersible showed multiple hits right under the @entity5 's main gun , perhaps the most powerful naval cannon at that time			1
it weighed 270 tons , and gunners had to duck into a blast shelter before firing it to keep from getting killed			0
while in the @entity5 's death throes , the gun discharged one time before everyone took cover and blew sailors off the ship 's deck , @entity18 's researchers said			1
it was one of three such guns followed by rows of other guns			0
the @entity5 was the most heavily armed ship of its time , the researchers said			1
but the giant had an achilles heel			0
it was very vulnerable to torpedoes			0
the ship caught fire ; it lost most of its propeller power and began to flail			0
@entity1 warplanes went in for the kill			0
" no defenses would have saved her , " an expedition member commented , as the submersible drifted past one gun turret or gun mount after the next			0
as the @entity5 sank , parts of it , where air was trapped imploded			1
the wreck landed in pieces on the sea floor with some 1,000 crew members			0
about 1,300 more were rescued by other @entity6 ships , including the executive officer			2
the camera appeared to spare viewers any skeletal remains , but among unfired shells and bent iron , small objects peered at the lens			0
could the small chain have been a necklace ? pocket watch chain ? those wanting to answer those questions themselves will find the recording of the tour archived on @entity18 's website			1
launched in 1940 , the @entity5 was , at the time , in the largest class of warship ever constructed , displacing more than 69,000 tons			2
it had a twin , the @entity152			0
the @entity153 sank the @entity5 during the @entity154 , part of the @entity156 in the central @entity17			1
@entity19 billionaire @entity18 has said his long fascination with @entity14 history was inspired by his father 's service in the @entity161			1
to finally arrive at the wreck , @entity74 's team scoured historical records from four countries and undersea topographical data before sending down detection devices , such as the @entity168 that have searched for missing airliner @entity169			1
nearly a decade passed before they had the wreck in their sites			0
" that moment of discovery was exhilarating , " @entity62 said			0
@entity2 's @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181 contributed to this report .			0

@entity6 's giant battleship @entity5 was sunk off the @entity17 in @entity14
a team led by @entity19 co-founder @entity18 said it found the wreck after an eight year search
