an employee at the center has tested positive for the bacterium , which is kept at the facility			0
the employee is not sick , and @entity13 , a @entity0 spokesman , said the bacteria probably are n't a threat to the general population			1
inspectors from the @entity0 and the @entity18 @entity19 said the misuse of outer garments " could have led to the bacteria clinging to inner garments and getting carried out of the select agent lab where research was being conducted with the bacteria on mice , " a news release said			1
" additionally , @entity0 and @entity19 inspectors determined that @entity7 primate center staff frequently entered the select agent lab without appropriate protective clothing , which would increase the risk of bringing the bacteria out of the lab or becoming infected themselves			1
" the bacterium , @entity32 , was being tested on mice in a biosafety level 3 lab at the @entity37 , @entity36 campus			0
it can cause can cause melioidosis , also known as @entity41 's disease			0
all research with the agent at the facility was suspended on february 11 and will remain suspended until it can be shown that there are no more risks and that proper procedures are being followed , the @entity0 said			1

" the @entity0 and @entity18 @entity66 say they have completed their investigation , which began in november when two monkeys were diagnosed with @entity41 's disease			2
six others had antibodies indicating exposure to the bacterium			0
according to the @entity0 , " the bacteria causing melioidosis are found in contaminated water and soil			2
it is spread to humans and animals through direct contact with the contaminated source			0
" it is not transmitted between humans or animals , " and the risk of acquiring melioidosis is low , " the @entity0 said			2
@entity91 " is predominately a disease of tropical climates , especially in @entity88 and northern @entity89 where it is widespread , " according to the @entity0 website .			0
