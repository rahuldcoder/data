@entity0 , the @entity2 opposition leader slain friday night a stone 's throw from the @entity5 , was a true original , one of the towering figures of his country 's post-communist political odyssey			1
we do not know yet who it was who shot him four times in the back			2
various theories have been floated			2
but by far the most plausible is that his killers wanted to silence one of the most determined and courageous @entity2 campaigners for personal and political freedoms			1
whether @entity0 offended by attacking the authoritarianism of @entity26 's regime , the jingoistic imperialism of his @entity29 campaign or even the massacre of journalists at @entity32 , it comes to the same thing in the end : he stood up consistently for the values of the @entity36 against its motley army of enemies			1
born in the @entity40 resort of @entity41 , @entity0 began as an atomic physicist but rose to prominence in the early 1990s as the reformist governor of @entity46 province			1
president @entity47 took a liking to him and brought him to @entity49			2
" what a stubborn nature , " he wrote of @entity0			1
" reminds me of myself			2
" @entity0 was the first person @entity47 anointed as his political successor			1
( unfortunately , he was not the last			2
) after @entity26 's election in 2000 , @entity0 hoped at first that the new president would keep his promise to restore order while preserving democracy			1
soon disillusioned , @entity0 became one of @entity26 's most biting critics			1
he was a natural politician -- emotional , gregarious , articulate			0
like @entity47 -- but unlike @entity26 -- he enjoyed meeting ordinary people and was energized by electoral campaigns			0
some snickered at @entity0 's extravagant personality , his hints of bravado and weakness for the fairer sex			1
but his determination and talent commanded respect			0
yet it is also true that , by the mid- 2000s , @entity0 was widely viewed as a spent force			1
and when the @entity73 polled @entity2 in 2013 , 6 % approved of his actions , while 48 % disapproved and 46 % claimed to know nothing about him			1
along with all other @entity2 liberals of the 1990s , he failed to forge a connection to the discontented groups outside @entity49			1
he titled his first book of memoirs , " @entity81 , " but to true provincials he looked like the elite			0
as one analyst told me , when @entity0 turned up at far - flung rallies in a sparkling , immaculately ironed , white shirt , it symbolized the class divide between him and his audience			1
by the wave of protests in 2011 - 12 , his generation 's day had passed			0
the new activists in their 30s and 40s had a different sensibility , a new cadence of speech to fit the internet age			0
on the stage before the @entity103 demonstrators , @entity0 often bombed			1
" @entity110 ! " he said , in his last interview , when the host tried to tease out of him a confession of presidential ambitions			0
" enough already ! " but the dwindling appeal of @entity113 - style liberalism did not stop him			0
@entity0 's doggedness during the last decade -- plugging away despite public indifference or scorn -- makes it the most impressive chapter of his career			1
having been chauffeured to his government office in the 1990s , @entity0 marched in the rain among bedraggled crowds in the 2000s as police wheeled out noise - making machinery to drown out the sound of his bullhorn			1
he endured the eggs and ammonia hurled at him by @entity131 hooligans			0
not shrinking from arrest , he spent more than a few nights in holding cells			0
even as the boyish charmer turned into a graying baby boomer with reading glasses that slipped down his nose , @entity0 refused to slacken			1
shut out of national politics , he ran for mayor of @entity41 -- and got 13.6 % of the vote			0
( even had the election been fair , he would probably have lost			0
) undeterred , he won a seat as deputy in the @entity145			0
swallowing his pride , he battled on because he cared about @entity2 and because , well ... politics was what he did			1
the killing comes at a time when the @entity5 is clearly nervous			1
with the ruble and growth rate both plunging , glimmers of opposition have already appeared in unexpected corners			2
five deputies in the usually subservient @entity157 have tabled a bill to repeal the sanctions @entity26 slapped on @entity161 food imports , calling them unconstitutional			0
if the economic slide continues , @entity26 's high ratings are likely to fall			0
in undemocratic states , the killing of a major opposition figure is sometimes the spark that lights the fuse			2
in the @entity176 , after @entity171 ' military thugs shot @entity172 on the tarmac at the @entity175 airport , this set off the " people 's power " movement that eventually swept the dictator from office			0
the murder of @entity183 by @entity185 's agents helped to discredit the @entity187 leader			2
and yet @entity2 is in a poisonous state of division			1
the country 's westernized fringe may be galvanized into opposition			2
but as war fever bleeds into economic anxiety , a pervasive resentment and directionless aggression seem more likely in the short run than a united uprising for civil and political rights			0
meanwhile , the wait for answers continues			0
the attack took place in an area saturated with video cameras			0
within hours , one television station was showing footage of the killing -- albeit from a considerable distance			0
@entity0 was almost certainly under surveillance at the time			1
if the @entity5 did not know before , it very likely knows by now who the killer was			1
its next decision will be how to use the information for its own purposes			0
whether or not the actual perpetrators are caught and punished , all know who created the climate of hatred in which liberal politicians are likened to " jackals who hang around foreign embassies " and a " fifth column " of traitors			0
@entity0 in his later years was never a threat to @entity26 's regime			1
hardly a radical revolutionary , he cooperated with the authorities to avoid violence by moving the site of the first major @entity49 demonstration in december 2011 , and he participated in discussions with then - president @entity237 about reforms of the political system			0
having come to symbolize for most @entity2 the disorder of the 1990s , he had little chance of rising to the top again			2
indeed , he was the kind of liberal -- unbowed , unabashedly pro-western , unpopular -- whom the @entity5 loved to hate			2
now it will have to find somebody else .			0

@entity2 opposition leader @entity0 was *gunned* down near the @entity5
@entity249 : he was courageous , talented but had had little support in @entity2 since ' 90s
