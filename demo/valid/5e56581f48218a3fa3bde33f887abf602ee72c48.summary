a salary dispute between @entity1 has sent jitters through factory owners operating at an industrial complex that is supposed to be a symbol of cooperation for the divided @entity8			1
the disagreement started in late february , when the @entity11 government demanded an increase of around $ 8.60 a month for @entity11 employees working in the @entity14			1
@entity1 is working on a response to the demands , leaving factory owners worried about the threat of a factory shutdown			1
" i 'm already nervous about the situation because of the traumatic experience in 2013 when the @entity1 closed down the complex , " said @entity20 , the @entity21 head of an automobile parts manufacturer that employs 400 @entity11 in @entity14			1
@entity20 's company , @entity26 , operates out of @entity14 , which is just north of the @entity27 in @entity11 territory			1
he was referring to @entity11 's monthslong closure of @entity14 in 2013 , during a period of heightened tension on the peninsula			1
about 125 @entity21 companies operate out of @entity14 , employing more than 50,000 @entity11 workers			2
an official from the @entity21 government 's @entity36 , who according to policy spoke to @entity2 on condition of anonymity , says companies at @entity14 pay their @entity11 workers an average of $ 155.50 a month			1
@entity11 is demanding an increase of roughly 5.5 % , to an equivalent $ 164.10 a month			1
the @entity21 government argues that the salary hike is a breach of an existing agreement for the industrial park , which first opened in 2004			0
the official called the @entity1 's request a " one - sided demand			1
" the official did not rule out the possibility that penalties could be imposed on @entity21 companies if they individually agree to raise employee salaries			0
manufacturers in @entity14 rely on the government in @entity59 to represent them in negotiations with @entity62			0
" it feels like we 're entering a very difficult phase where innocent corporations are being beaten up by political fights between the @entity1 , " @entity63 , the director of @entity64 of the @entity14 , said wednesday			2
experts say this is n't the first time the @entity73 have butted heads over employee salaries in @entity14			0
the industrial park was established as a symbol of cooperation at a time when a previous government in @entity1 was pursuing a " @entity82 " of friendship with its northern rival			2
@entity21 companies benefited from the extremely low cost of @entity11 labor			2
meanwhile , @entity11 gained a valuable stream of hard currency revenue by appropriating an undisclosed amount of salary from its citizens working in @entity14			1
@entity21 employers also made a practice of giving small food bonuses to some hungry employees			0
for a time , this came in the form of " @entity97 , " a packaged @entity21 dessert			0
the snacks reportedly became highly - prized items on the black market in the communist @entity1 's rigidly controlled economy			1
eventually , employers transitioned to giving workers instant noodles , as one former @entity14 factory owner told @entity2 in 2014 , " in order to provide a more substantial snack			0
" " the whole project is built with an understanding that @entity11 wages should and will continue to rise , " says @entity109 , associate professor at @entity111 's graduate school of international studies in @entity59			2
but one factory owner said the communist regime 's most recent approach to the salaries is problematic			0
" the amount of the pay raise demanded this time is small , " said @entity26 's @entity20			2
" but having this kind of precedent may lead to losing control of the operation in the complex			0
" experts say @entity59 and @entity62 's approach to the @entity14 salary dispute will serve as an important barometer for the direction of future relations between the rival governments			0
" @entity14 is the last living legacy of the @entity82 , " says professor @entity109 of @entity135			0
" if something like wage disputes lead to the shutdown or freezing of @entity14 , that would be a major blow			0
