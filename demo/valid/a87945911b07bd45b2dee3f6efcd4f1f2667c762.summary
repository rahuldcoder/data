a wall of water and mud surged through @entity11 's house , toppling the walls of the neighboring church where he serves as a deacon			1
it was midnight on friday , and he had no choice but to wade out into the gale force wind and darkness			2
" the water was up to my waist ! " he says			2
@entity11 eventually made it to higher ground , taking shelter on a parked van			2
fortunately , he had sent his family away before the storm to a shelter in the center of the capital , @entity0			2
but on monday , three days after the storm struck , @entity11 and his daughters sit in the debris strewn rubble of their home			2

nearby , @entity11 's daughter @entity47 slowly scrubs mud out of a shirt			1
other families all across this tropical town are facing similar difficulties in the aftermath of the storm			0
to many @entity55 , @entity1 is a holiday destination boasting crystal blue waters and luxury yachts			1
but it 's also one of the poorest nations in the @entity62 , and many of its 260,000 inhabitants live in flimsy houses built of thatch or metal sheets			1
those vulnerable homes were dealt a fearsome blow over the weekend by @entity3 , one of the strongest storms ever to make landfall			0
the aid group @entity73 is warning that the cyclone may have caused " one of the worst disasters ever seen in the @entity62			1
" the storm rampaged across @entity1 's sprawling archipelago of more than 80 islands on friday and saturday , wielding 155 mph ( 250 kph ) winds			1
about 65 islands in the archipelago are inhabited			1

how to help @entity1 residents @entity1 president @entity97 told @entity2 the destruction was the worst his country had ever experienced , describing the storm as " a monster			1
" he said it would take the developing nation " a couple of years " to get back to where it was before @entity3 struck			1
in the capital , @entity0 , residents were still reeling from the storm 's impact			2
thousands of people have been left homeless and many who rely on subsistence farming to get by have seen their main source of food wiped out			0
most people live on root crops , said @entity117 , a ranking natural disaster official			0
" what the people depend on entirely is just wiped out			0

just too much to contain , " he said			0

officials say @entity3 destroyed or badly damaged 90 % of the houses in @entity0 , as well as flooding parts of the hospital and trashing schools and churches			0
there were some small signs of progress around the capital			0
a lack of electricity and running water has n't stopped residents from starting the hard work of clearing away fallen trees and branches , as well as the corrugated metal roofing that @entity3 ripped off thousands of buildings			0

the main airport is back in business , allowing military aircraft from @entity164 and @entity165 to bring in aid workers and supplies			1
