@entity0 @entity3 's @entity2 sits in downtown @entity0			1
this pocket of 2,000 men and women constitutes the nation 's biggest concentration of homeless people living and sleeping on public sidewalks , in scattered camps under tarps			1
not surprisingly , sanitary conditions are appalling			0
this quarter of despair is now at the center of national attention for another reason : this week , @entity0 police and a homeless man in a tent engaged in a confrontation , ending with officers fatally shooting the man known only as " @entity24 , " an apparent reference to his home continent			1
it was all captured on video by bystanders			0
police allege " @entity24 " tried to reach for an officer 's gun , prompting the police gunfire against him			2
" @entity2 is a 54 - block area that has the largest homeless number of individuals in the country , " said @entity34 , executive director of the @entity35			1
he 's based in @entity40			1
" @entity40 has the largest homeless population , but @entity0 has the highest unsheltered population in the country , which has led to the destitution you see today , " he added			1
@entity40 's unique right - to - shelter mandate ensures " temporary emergency shelter to every man , woman , and child who is eligible for services , every night , " the city 's website says			1
but not in @entity0 , where two - thirds of the county 's 40,000 homeless people are unsheltered , @entity34 said			1
so many live on the streets of downtown @entity0 -- and elsewhere			1
in some @entity3 minds , @entity0 may conjure up images of a great @entity3 city cursed with an abandoned urban core			1
that 's an old memory			2
today , downtown @entity0 enjoys a renaissance , right down to the new hotels and mall surrounding the @entity67 , where professional basketball and hockey are played , often to championships			1
( that 's its official designation			2
even @entity74 maps label it so			0
) there are few champion moments here			0
the only exception may be the everyday heroes who labor in 107 charities and agencies feeding and comforting the lost souls bivouacked on the street			0
the triple - digit number of social service agencies , however , is often cited as one reason that @entity0 endures as the nation 's @entity2 capital : there 's a $ 54 - million - a - year charitable infrastructure anchored to the poverty district			1
nobody seems to be going anywhere			0
that does n't deter @entity95 , manager of government and public affairs for the @entity98 , which strives to lift people out of poverty			2
his work and those of his peers is like that of @entity111 to the rock , the mythic figure whose endless labor was to push a rock to the top of a mountain and then have to do it all over again after the rock rolled downhill			0
" @entity2 has become less transient , " @entity95 said			1
" the history of skid row goes back to a transient neighborhood associated with the railroad			0
the true definition of transient is short term			0
now it 's long term			2
it 's become a neighborhood			2
" the century - old @entity98 now serves 3,000 meals daily to the homeless , @entity95 said			1
@entity95 cites a shortage of affordable housing as a reason for how " there 's no place for people to go			2
" he asserts his agencies and others offers hope to those who feel hopeless			0
@entity95 knows from personal experience			0
he once worked for @entity138 as a network administrator in the 1990s , but he lost it all , including his family			0
drug addiction obliterated his life			0
" after destroying my family , in and out of jail , in and out of treatment , i was living on the streets and doing what people have to do on the streets to support a really gnarly heroin habit , " @entity95 said			2
" in august of 2011 , i was brought to the @entity98 homeless , " he added			0
" i had a backpack on			0
" he now wears a suit , on @entity2 's front line , trying to relieve and unravel the nation 's gordian knot of poverty			1
@entity1 's @entity159 contributed to this report .			0
