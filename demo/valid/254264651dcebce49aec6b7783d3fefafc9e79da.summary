@entity2 , @entity3 as nuclear talks with @entity6 neared the endgame , @entity1 secretary of state @entity0 shied away from predicting success			1
difficult issues remain on the table as the world 's most powerful diplomats meet in @entity3 with @entity6 nuclear negotiators , @entity0 told @entity4 on monday			1
" we are working very hard to work those through			2
we are working late into the night and obviously into tomorrow			2
we are working with a view to get something done , " he said			1
" there is a little more light there today , but â€‹ there are still some tricky issues			0
everyone knows the meaning of tomorrow			0
" negotiators have set tuesday as their deadline for a basic deal			0
a comprehensive deal , including technical additions , is supposed to be negotiated by june 30			0
world powers are seeking the outlines of an agreement they say would stop @entity6 from getting a nuclear weapon for at least 15 years			1
in exchange , @entity6 would get out from punishing sanctions that have crippled its economy			1
@entity0 's comments to @entity4 came after uncomfortable rumblings about the talks in @entity2 , @entity3 , made headlines			1
the assertion : @entity6 backpedaled the day before on an important detail of a possible deal to prevent it from developing a nuclear bomb			1
on sunday , an @entity6 negotiator told journalists that @entity50 would not send fissile material to @entity52 , which diplomats had earlier told journalists was part of the plan to put potential bomb - making materials out of reach			1
" the export of stocks of enriched uranium is not in our program , and we do not intend to send them abroad			0
... there is no question of sending the stocks abroad , " @entity6 deputy foreign minister @entity66 said			1
but on monday , a senior @entity71 official said the rumblings in the press should quiet down			0
negotiators had not yet decided any specifics about the disposal of fissile material , and @entity6 has made the comments many times before , the official said , citing a list of previous examples of such statements in press reports			1
@entity84 foreign minister @entity83 sounded optimistic as he briefed reporters on the talks ' progress earlier monday , saying that the diplomats were " narrowing down " their differences and working out ways to resolve sticking points			1
" these marathon - like negotiations have reached the final stage , " he said			1
things have been tense in @entity2 as the deadline for an agreement looms , with talks snagged on three important points : how quickly or slowly @entity6 will be allowed to advance its nuclear technology in the last five years of the 15 - year agreement			1
how quickly crushing @entity103 sanctions will go away			1
whether sanctions will snap back into place if @entity6 violates the deal			1
@entity6 wants them gone for good			1
but international negotiators want merely to suspend them , so they can reapply them as leverage if @entity6 does not keep the bargain			1
agreement on the points is crucial , a @entity114 diplomat said			0
" there can not be an agreement if we do not have answers to these questions , " the diplomat said			0
in the background , a vocal critic of a possible deal spoke out again			0
over the weekend , @entity126 prime minister @entity125 denounced the deal he believes is taking shape			2
" this agreement as it evolves is fulfilling our deepest fears and even worse , " he said after a meeting in @entity126 with visiting @entity1 senate majority leader @entity132			0
@entity125 also attacked @entity6 for its support of @entity135 rebels in @entity136 , who have overtaken many parts of that country			2
he said @entity6 was trying to take over the whole @entity139 with the nuclear deal and its influence in @entity136			2
conservative @entity143 lawmakers are threatening new sanctions if @entity50 does n't comply with demands , which could throw a wrench into negotiations			2
@entity1 negotiators are working to reach an agreement in part to prevent this kind of congressional punishment			2
they fear it could prompt hardliners in @entity50 to push for killing the talks , which would scuttle the chances of a deal altogether			0
aside from the three tough points , negotiators on both sides have shown optimism			0
@entity1 officials have said most of the other elements were solvable if those three major hurdles could be overcome			0
" getting to an accord is doable			0
solutions have been found for numerous questions , " he said			0
@entity6 would like sanctions lifted as soon as a deal is signed			1
but diplomats says it 's not so simple			0
@entity6 could see unilateral sanctions relief in the areas of trade , oil and banking , but sanctions adopted by the @entity103 are more complicated			1
many are related to proliferation and transfer of missile technology and are tied to certification by the @entity103 nuclear watchdog , the @entity185 , that @entity6 's nuclear program does not have a military dimension			1
on saturday , @entity6 foreign minister @entity188 showed some optimism about finding a path through the deadlock			1
he said he believes the world powers " have realized that sanctions , pressure and an agreement will not go together			0
it 's only to translate that understanding and realization into the agreement that we are negotiating			0
" @entity1 officials said that all sides , including @entity6 , agree that sanctions would be lifted in phases over time as @entity6 confirms its compliance to the deal			1
but they acknowledge there is still disagreement on the actual formula			0
@entity6 also wants to be allowed to develop more advanced centrifuges while the deal is in effect			2
new machines would enrich uranium much faster than current machines			0
@entity1 and @entity216 officials worry that could enable @entity6 quickly to produce enough highly enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon			1
diplomats say the first 10 years of the 15 - year deal would have the most stringent restrictions , which would be relaxed over the last five			0
" we are not asking them to do nothing ( in technology development ) , but they want to do more than we want them to do , " a @entity114 diplomat said			0
but the diplomat added , " after 15 years , they can do what they want			0
" diplomats said @entity6 has agreed to a cap of fewer than 6,000 centrifuges that it can operate to enrich uranium			2
that figure is down from the 6,000 the sides were speaking about when the talks started thursday , but substantially more than the several hundred the @entity1 had originally wanted			0
@entity6 currently runs about 10,000 centrifuges , but it has around 19,000 in its stockpile			2
@entity1 officials maintain the number is not that important , because there will be other restrictions on the levels of enrichment and type of centrifuges @entity6 can operate , which they believe will extend the time @entity6 would need to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon -- known as the " breakout time " -- to at least a year			2
while the focus this week is on the march 31 deadline , it 's important to note it is n't the final deadline			2
even if a pact is reached tuesday , it 's unclear what form it would take , and the @entity1 and @entity6 have varying needs			1
the parties are seeking to reach what 's being called a framework agreement -- essentially a political understanding of the main principles of the final deal			2
but if they 're able to come together on the big issues , they still have until the end of june when the @entity273 expires to iron out the details			0
so that means the talks wo n't be finished this month			0
officials have been vague about the format this framework deal might take as well as how much of it will be made known to the public and international stakeholders			0
the @entity1 would prefer a written accord , but @entity6 has balked at putting anything in writing until a comprehensive deal is reached			1
@entity1 officials say they will need to quantify @entity6 's commitments before submitting the agreement to @entity289			1
but @entity1 and @entity114 diplomats say that @entity6 is looking simply for an " understanding " of what has been agreed to before a formal accord is reached			1
@entity4 's @entity294 , @entity295 and @entity296 contributed to this report .			0
