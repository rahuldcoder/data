it 's probably the most important advice @entity4 movie superstar @entity3 ever received : " my friend said , " @entity3 recalls , " ' you look like a great actor , why do n't you act ? ' " that was some 25 years ago , when @entity3 was looking for funds to cover his school examination fees			1
@entity3 took his friend 's suggestion and started auditioning for tv shows			1
he quickly landed a role in a successful soap opera , and soon after he made his debut in @entity17 , @entity4 's mighty movie making machine			2
today , @entity3 is one of the industry 's most popular names , having starred in dozens of films and won several accolades			1
his latest movie -- " @entity24 , " by director @entity25 -- became last month the first @entity17 film to premiere at @entity28 's @entity27 , @entity30 's biggest cinema screen			2
@entity2 's @entity31 caught up with @entity3 to talk about @entity4 's film industry and present him with the questions you sent via the # @entity35 and # @entity37 hashtags			1
@entity2 : how have you seen @entity17 change and grow over the years ? @entity3 : there have been several phases in @entity17 , like in everything in life			1
we started off @entity17 almost like making bread out of stone ; there was nothing , no investment , no structure , nothing on the ground to actually help the industry but we 've brought it this far and we are very happy			2
@entity2 : how do you see the political situation in @entity4 and what do you think about the recent security tensions ? @entity58 : i find it quite dicey , it 's a case of uncertainty , not knowing what is going to happen ... however i 'm actually endorsing the present government because he [ president @entity66 ] has contributed immensely to the growth of our industry -- call me selfish call me what but i 've been in this industry for 25 years , no government ever spoke about my industry like this one			2
he gave us audience , he listened to us , he gave several grants to help the industry , he sent so many of the practitioners outside to big film schools ... he 's giving money for distribution -- so for all these reasons			2
there was a point where there was a nosedive , when it was hitting the rocks because it was predominantly dependent on dvds , and the quality of the production was poor			2
it was successful up to a point until piracy came in and intellectual properties were n't protected and practitioners were n't getting their worth			0
but now there is the cinema , which is growing drastically in @entity4 and that has really helped bring back @entity17			0
so i would say right now it 's getting better ... because cinema culture is beginning to come -- if you 're going to shoot a cinema movie then you 've got to be thinking about the quality of the production and of the story			0
@entity2 : so what have you learned throughout this journey ? @entity58 : i learned a whole lot of lessons , when the chips were high -- many people knew me and everything but i was so deeply passionate about the industry that i wanted growth and i wanted something better			0
i wanted @entity17 to look like @entity116 and @entity117 , i wanted it to have that appeal ... and at some point in my industry it was n't happening			0
because i 'm one of the very top actors , knowing that with my influence i could make a difference , i decided at some point ... to be like " look guys , lets upgrade , the new technologies are coming , how do we move forward			0
" most of the people i was working with wanted to live in that mindset , and i felt " no , i need to make a change , " ... and then i was just picking movies deliberately that i knew would stand the test of time as i grow old			0
@entity3 : i think my greatest inspiration is my passion for my art. my passion is my major drive , i love what i do and i like the competition , i like the circumstances that surround my industry and how to make it better -- if it was too easy and too fluid , maybe if it was n't as challenging , my passion would have died but i think the challenges make it stronger for me			1
@entity3 : i 'm not very certain -- i 've come to learn about life that never say never			1
i was thinking maybe in the next 10 years i 'll probably be behind the camera , directing and working on my own flicks but at the same time , of course , if in the next 10 years i am still good enough to tell a story and get into characters then i will still be there acting			0
besides that , of course , humanitarian stuff mostly			0
@entity3 : i think it 's a public service kind of thing that everyone is beginning to think that " ok , we can make a change " ... and most of my colleagues are thinking , " if people believe in me that i can do it then i can make it happen			1
" for me , i 'm too much of a creative person than a politician so it 's going to be really hard , but i never say never ... i 'm not ruling it out and i 'm not saying that i 'm keen or i 'm going to go there			0
@entity3 : i stay under the radar ( laughs )			1
i do n't know i 'm not a scandalous person by nature so i guess that 's what it is			0
@entity3 : yes , yes my pair , my partner -- of course , i will , some time hopefully soon , we 're looking forward to working on another very good blockbuster some time in the future			1
@entity3 : i am spearheading the " @entity17 , " so it 's more of getting a good production out and getting a good production out is quite capital intensive			1
you need investors and you need to explain to the investors and let them know what they 're going to benefit if they do get involved			0
so it 's a long thing , unlike how we just used to do cheap movies and it was like quick -- people could actually tell most of our stories from the beginning , they could tell the end already			0
i want that to change , hence i do n't do too many of them movies anymore , but the cinema movies are now coming out and when that starts to come out then it would give room to people getting more from the movies			0
@entity3 : i usually like to unwind by playing my sports : i like to play squash a lot , and i love adventure so basically when i 'm not working i like to do crazy things , the things that people would least except that i 'd want to do like skydiving , bungee jumping , mountain climbing , all of those things			1
read this : ' @entity219 ' brings @entity17 to world @entity221 : @entity4 's soul superstar is back - and as outspoken as ever more from @entity224 voices you can follow @entity3 on @entity226 and on @entity227 .			1
