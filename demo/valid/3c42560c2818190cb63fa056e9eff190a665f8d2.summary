@entity0 previously secret correspondence between @entity4 's @entity3 and government officials is to be made public after a @entity7 ruling thursday			1
the @entity9 newspaper had been fighting for the communications to be released since 2005			1
@entity3 is next in line to the @entity4 throne and as @entity13 would constitutionally be required to maintain strict political neutrality			1
some commentators say letters to officials suggest he could be a " meddling king , " attempting to influence politicians			2
after the judgment was released thursday , @entity9 editor - in - chief @entity19 said the paper was " delighted " about the @entity7 's decision after what he said was a " brilliant 10 - year campaign by @entity9 reporter @entity25			1
" " the government wasted hundreds of thousands of pounds trying to cover up these letters , admitting their publication would ' seriously damage ' perceptions of the @entity3 's political neutrality			1
now they must publish them so that the public can make their own judgment , " @entity19 said			2
@entity35 , @entity1 's royal correspondent , says the letters are part of a broader discussion about the role of the heir to the throne			2
" these were private letters , never meant for public consumption , which is why the @entity3 's office has resisted their release , " he said			1
" but they play into a much bigger debate about the role of monarchy			0
should @entity3 be getting involved in politics at all when , as head of state , he 'll be expected to be politically neutral ? he 's not in that position yet so feels he has some leeway			2
" prime minister @entity54 said the judgment was " disappointing " and the government would now look at how to release the letters			1
" this is about the principle that senior members of the royal family are able to express their views to government confidentially			0
i think most people would agree this is fair enough , " he said			0
@entity54 suggested the legislation might need revision in light of the decision : " our @entity71 ( freedom of information ) laws specifically include the option of a governmental veto , which we exercised in this case for a reason			2
if the legislation does not make @entity81 's intentions for the veto clear enough , then we will need to make it clearer			0
" the @entity3 's official residence , @entity84 , issued a brief statement about the decision			1
" this is a matter for the government			0
@entity84 is disappointed the principle of privacy has not been upheld			2
" the anti-monarchy group @entity91 welcomed the news but warned that 2010 changes to the @entity94 to remove the public interest clause put future releases at risk			0
" the government must now act to end royal secrecy			0
any risk to the monarchy must pale against a risk to democracy from having an activist prince acting in secret , " ceo @entity100 said			0
" we ca n't have a situation where we do n't know what influence @entity3 is having on government policy			0
" in a statement issued on the eve of the decision , @entity100 branded the monarchy one of @entity4 's " most secretive institutions			1
" " @entity3 clearly has his own political agenda , yet his name wo n't be on the ballot in may			0
so we all need to know what influence he is trying to exert and what impact he is having on policy			0
" @entity25 , the @entity9 reporter , had been fighting a legal battle to get the letters published since 2005 when he requested disclosure of communications between @entity3 and various government departments under the @entity4 's @entity94 and environmental regulations			1
after the departments and the information commissioner denied his requests , @entity25 appealed to the @entity131 , which referred the matter to the @entity133			0
the @entity9 reported in 2009 that @entity3 had written to @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 ministers over the previous three years and that his aides had also written letters to government officials			1
" the disclosures will fuel growing concern that the prince is continuing to interfere in political matters when many believe he should remain neutral if he wishes to become king , " the paper said			0
the @entity133 ruled in 2012 that many of the letters , " advocacy correspondence , " should be disclosed , but its decision was vetoed by @entity4 's attorney general , who issued a certificate overriding it			1
explaining his decision , the attorney general said that in that his view , the correspondence was " undertaken as part of the @entity159 ' preparation for becoming @entity13 " and contained nothing that outweighed " strong public interest against disclosure			0
" the @entity9 challenged the veto in court , but three high court judges dismissed it , so @entity25 appealed to the @entity7 , which on thursday ruled that the attorney general was not entitled to issue the certificate .			1

letters from prince @entity3 to officials must be released after a @entity7 judgment
