it will be months , or longer , before the causes behind tuesday 's crash of @entity8 are known , but there are initial clues that aviation experts say will be the most important to investigators			1
speculation comes in the wake of any tragedy such as this , but experts say certain facts can be significant for those who want to know what happened			0
the most useful clues so far : one of the plane 's " black boxes " has been recovered , the @entity22 interior minister said			1
the data recorder will be the most useful in determining the cause of the crash			1
its contents are still unknown , but it is a good sign that it was found just hours after the crash			1
@entity22 's aviation accident investigation bureau will examine the device immediately , the interior minister said			1
real - time flight data available to the public tells a key part of the story			1
according to online flight trackers , the @entity8 plane had been flying at 38,000 feet when , about 30 minutes into the trip , it started descending			1
six minutes later , it was recorded at 24,000 feet -- a drop of 14,000 feet			0
it continued to descend after that -- it 's last recorded altitude was 11,400 feet			0
the rate of descent indicates that the pilot was still controlling the plane to some extent , @entity0 aviation analyst @entity49 said			1
if the engines had stalled , the plane would have crashed in less time , she said			2
departure : @entity58 , @entity59 , at 10:01 a.m. ( 26 minutes late ) destination : scheduled to land in @entity61 , @entity62 , at 11:39 a.m. passengers : 150 ( 144 passengers , six crew members ) airplane : @entity66 ( twin - jet ) airline : @entity8 ( budget airline owned by @entity70 ) flight distance : 726 miles last known tracking data : 10:38 a.m. last known speed : 480 mph last known altitude : 11,400 feet last known location : near @entity76 , @entity22 , in the @entity77 sources : @entity0 and flightaware.com the initial data about the plane 's descent means that the pilot could have been trying to make an emergency landing , or that the plane was gliding with the pilot 's guidance , @entity49 said			1
a scenario where the plane was gliding is potentially more dangerous because wide fields for landing would be hard to come by in the mountains , she said			2
another aviation analyst , @entity92 , said the quickness of the descent shows something went wrong , but also that the plane was not out of control			1
the plane was descending " faster than an elevator at that point			2
you 're feeling it down			0
it 's pulling you down , and you can sense that , " @entity92 said			0
a telling piece of data is that the plane maintained speed as it descended , he said			2
it could show that the pilot was aware that something was wrong and was controlling the speed as the plane went down			2
" it was a controlled descent , and there was something that had gone wrong that he had no control over or he would have controlled it , " @entity92 said			0
the data on air traffic accidents are clear : a majority of accidents happen upon takeoff or landing			0
according to the @entity126 , even though 83 % of a plane 's flight time is taken up with the climb , cruise and descent phases , less than 16 % of accidents happen during this period			2
@entity92 described the timing of the crash as an " anomalous thing that happened			2
" it is " incredibly rare to happen in the middle of the flight , " he said , meaning the pilot would have to act fast			0
contrary to some early reports , the @entity135 told @entity0 that the crew of the @entity8 plane did not issue a distress call			1
it was air traffic controllers who sent out a distress call after radio contact with the plane was lost			2
the lack of an emergency call can raise a red flag to a nonpilot			2
why would a pilot not alert someone that there is an emergency ? does it hint to an incursion in the cockpit or a pilot 's motives ? it might sound counterintuitive , but calling for help is not the first thing on a pilot 's checklist when things go wrong			0
@entity92 said the principle that a pilot follows during an emergency is this : @entity167 , navigate and communicate			0
in other words , before turning on a distress call or transponder , the pilot 's first concern is to fly the plane , and secondly , to find the safest option for a crash landing , if it comes to that			1
the @entity8 pilot " was definitely aviating and navigating from what we can tell , " @entity92 said			1
the pilot was conceivably looking for a place to try to land , he said			0
a distress call -- had it happened -- could have signaled a different story			0
@entity49 explained that there are codes that pilots have -- certain words that if uttered by the pilot indicate to air traffic controllers that there is a hijacking			0
the initial reports are that there was no hijack code transmitted from the plane			0
a big part of determining the cause of the crash will be whether such a code was sent or not			1
" i do n't think you 'd rule anything out at this point , " @entity0 aviation analyst @entity198 said			1
" it 's not like it appears as if it was an in - flight breakup			0
so what was going on in the cockpit is what we 're going to be talking about in the coming days			0
" @entity198 pointed out the known details of the crash -- a rapid descent , no radio call and a flight that continues into the mountains -- are not part of a " typical emergency scenario			1
" there were no reported weather issues during the plane 's flight , but that does not mean you can rule these out as a possible cause , pilot and @entity0 aviation analyst @entity224 said			1
one thing @entity224 was looking at was a cold front progressing in the area where the plane was			0
it indicated some precipitation at lower altitudes			0
so there may not have been bad weather at the cruising altitude , but " at lower altitudes , as they were beginning the descent , their visibility may have been obscured , " @entity224 said			0
reduced visibility in and of itself is not a huge issue , but the weather may have deteriorated as the plane descended and be a possible factor in the crash , he said .			1

@entity0 aviation analyst says this is not a typical emergency *incident* , but all possibilities are part of probe
the cause behind the crash of the @entity8 plane is unknown
there are early clues , however , that will be key to investigators
