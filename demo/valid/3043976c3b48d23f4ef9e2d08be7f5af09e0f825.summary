you 're late for your flight , sweaty from having dragged your luggage to the check - in counter , and stressed about making it through security before boarding begins			0
for some of us , this is the rule , not the exception			0
for most of us , it 's a pretty unremarkable scenario			2
not so fast , says the @entity14			1
typical airport behavior like this could make you a suspicious traveler who should be subjected to questioning and additional screening -- and possibly referred to the police for investigation , detention or arrest			2
that should seem far - fetched , but it is n't			0
the @entity14 continues to use pseudo-scientific " behavior detection " techniques that have given rise to persistent allegations of racial and ethnic profiling at our nation 's airports			1
through a program called @entity36 , or spot , the @entity14 employs thousands of " behavior detection officers " who scrutinize travelers to look for signs of " mal - intent " in airport screening areas			1
the officers typically spend less than 30 seconds scanning an average passenger for over 90 behaviors the @entity14 associates with stress , fear or deception			1
when the officers perceive clusters of such behaviors in any given individual , they refer that person for secondary inspection and questioning			0
the spot program relies on theories about " micro-expressions , " involuntary facial expressions that supposedly appear for milliseconds despite one 's efforts to conceal them			1
behavior detection officers look for such micro-expressions while scanning passengers ' faces or engaging in casual conversation with them			2
it 's as nutty as it sounds			0
setting aside that the officers ' perception of these behaviors is inherently subjective , there 's just no evidence that deception or " mal - intent " can reliably be detected through observation , especially in an unstructured setting like an airport screening area			0
the fact that many people find such settings inherently stressful only compounds the problem			0
if @entity14 's behavior detection officers look for stress in a stressful environment , they 're going to find it , along with plenty of false positives			1
just about everyone outside the @entity14 who has reviewed the @entity36 program has decided that it 's unscientific and a waste of money			1
an exhaustive review by the @entity98 found the @entity36 program lacked a scientific basis , that the behavioral indicators it relied on were subjective , and that the @entity14 had no effective means to test its effectiveness			1
in no uncertain terms , the @entity98 recommended that @entity105 curtail funding for the program			0
an independent scientific advisory group that reviewed the @entity36 program also concluded that " no scientific evidence exists to support the detection or inference of future behavior , including intent			1
" and during a congressional hearing on the program , @entity114 rep. @entity114 of @entity115 observed , " to my knowledge , there has not been a single instance where a behavior detection officer has referred someone to a law enforcement officer and that individual turned out to be a terrorist			0
" rep. @entity126 of @entity127 , the @entity128 chairman of the @entity129 , stated , " i am concerned that @entity14 will continue to spin its wheels with this program instead of developing a more effective and efficient approach			1
" despite this withering criticism , spot remains in place and has cost taxpayers well over $ 1 billion ( that 's with a b ) since its inception in 2007			1
repeat : over a billion dollars on a misguided program that does n't work			2
equally troubling is that @entity36 has given rise to persistent allegations of racial and ethnic profiling -- an unfortunately inevitable result when law enforcement or border agents single people out based on hasty , gut - level judgments about them			2
allegations of profiling by behavior detection officers have come not only from travelers , but also from numerous other officers			0
over 30 behavior detection officers at @entity153 said that profiling was rampant there			0
one of the officers told reporters , " they just pull aside anyone who they do n't like the way they look -- if they are black and have expensive clothes or jewelry , or if they are @entity165			0
" another officer submitted an anonymous complaint saying , " the behavior detection program is no longer a behavior - based program , but it is a racial profiling program			0
" the @entity14 has not revealed what , if any , steps it has taken to ensure that unlawful profiling does not occur in airport screening			2
nor has @entity14 explained why -- despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary -- @entity36 contributes meaningfully to aviation security			1
that 's why the @entity178 submitted an @entity180 request to @entity14 seeking information on its use of behavior detection			1
we 've received no response , so we 're taking the @entity14 to court to get the information the public needs to fully evaluate it			2
people expect that when they travel , they will be screened for weapons or explosives that could bring down an airplane			0
they do n't expect -- nor should they -- that officers will make probing judgments about their intentions based on little more than their facial expressions , or that they will be stopped , questioned and perhaps even searched because of their race or ethnicity			0
it 's time for @entity14 to explain and justify the spot program			1
or better yet , listen to those who say it 's a waste of money and scrap it entirely .			2

@entity14 's spot program screens passengers for " micro-expressions " to determine if a person is suspicious
@entity210 : @entity36 program is unscientific , has wasted over $ 1 billion of taxpayer money and should be terminated
