i am a friendly , hard - working @entity3 native			1
it 's how a lot of my friends in @entity7 describe @entity8			1
it 's as if we 're assembled at " @entity11 , " devoid of color or depth			1
we supposedly represent all that is wholesome in @entity16			1
that may be true , but " friendly and hard - working " is so ... bland			1
if you think i 'm being a tad harsh , ask anyone who is n't from the @entity8 to describe someone born and raised in @entity21			1
my favorite definition came from a colleague raised in @entity24			1
she struggled to describe us at first , then said , " simple			1
" um , like the @entity27 ? " no , " she said , flustered			1
even my fellow @entity8 have a hard time coming up with interesting descriptors			1
@entity1 legal analyst @entity30 is a proud native of @entity31 , @entity32			2
first thing out of his mouth , " friendliness ! " after that , he struggled , too			1
" boy , let me see ... um.			2
. not easily agitated ? " i rolled my eyes			2
" that is so bland , @entity30			2
" he paused , then said , " i 'll take bland over the rap @entity24 gets any day			2
" even my new friend , @entity41 , from @entity42 struggled			2
the best he could come up with was " hearty			2
" i asked these questions after interviewing @entity45 , who wants his native @entity46 to divorce itself from the @entity8			1
" we 're @entity8 if you 're looking at it from @entity7 or from anywhere on [ the @entity54 ] @entity53 , " @entity45 told me			1
" but then again , that 's someone else 's definition			2
i think it 's time for us to claim our own			2
" @entity45 and his brother , @entity58 , whose father is the state 's governor , are @entity62 businessmen whose clothing store and restaurant have a decidedly local flavor			1
@entity45 , after touring @entity67 ( many @entity66 are of @entity69 descent ) , became enthralled by the region 's strong identity			1
it proudly embraced its chilly weather , its food , its culture , its ... @entity76			2
so why , he questioned , did n't @entity46 ? when @entity45 got home he hired a @entity46 company to make stocking hats for his clothing boutique that said , " @entity31			2
" they sold out and @entity45 's idea headed , well , north			2
@entity66 just got it , he said			2
i admit , i did n't get it , until i thought more about it			2
@entity46 -- or should i say @entity62 -- is criticized , by some of my compatriots , for being " @entity46 nice , " the sort of " nice " ( fake ) that is n't remotely the kind of " nice " ( sincere ) for which @entity8 are renowned			1
but , hey , i have an open mind			2
you could argue that @entity46 , along with @entity98 , parts of @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity42 and @entity32 , are in the @entity99 of the @entity16			0
and , you could argue @entity3 , @entity100 and @entity101 are eastern states			0
the only truly @entity8 states are @entity96 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108			1
go ahead , argue among yourselves , but know that mr. @entity45 is n't talking only about geography when it comes to labeling @entity46 -- " @entity111			0
" he 's talking about image and , although he wo n't say it , branding			0
" the @entity115 had done an article highlighting different @entity118 side dishes , " @entity45 told me			0
" for @entity46 , they named grape salad as our signature side dish			0
and no one in @entity46 had ever heard of grape salad ... it was kind of a harmless example , but if we do n't tell the rest of the country who we are , we end up with grape salad			1
" that story got under my skin , especially when i looked up the @entity115 idea of @entity3 's signature side dish : @entity137 pea and onion salad			0
the @entity115 extolled the salad 's " deliciousness " by saying it " calls to mind the processed - food delights that , for decades , characterized the cooking of the @entity8			1
" seriously ? the @entity115 is n't solely to blame for the @entity8 's image problem			1
@entity146 is a distinguished professor of history at @entity148 in @entity3			0
he wrote a book called " the identity of the @entity8 : essays on @entity151			1
" " the @entity8 , " he told me , " has always been a dynamic and diverse place , but that image does n't fit with what people want to believe			1
" and , by people , @entity146 means politicians who routinely use the @entity8 as code for a place in time that never actually existed : crime - free and populated with hard - working people who all look and worship the same			1
" arguing about the @entity8 , " @entity146 says , " has become arguing about @entity16 as a whole			1
" so , listen up , campaigning politicians ! stop trying to bond with the @entity8 with your bowling prowess ( or lack thereof ) and for goodness ' sake , stop eating corn dogs at state fairs			1
and while i 'm at it , political reporters , please stop interviewing voters in diners ! i 'm not maligning bowling ( my dad , @entity177 , is in the @entity178 ) or corn dogs , but those things do n't represent the modern @entity8			1
it is so much more dynamic and , yes , diverse			0
@entity182 is not like @entity183			0
@entity184 is not like @entity185			0
@entity186 is not like @entity187 , or @entity188 or @entity189 or @entity190			0
and , @entity62 is not like any of them , either			1
@entity46 boasts 10,000 lakes and a corresponding love of cold - weather sports , such as pond hockey			0
yet , i 'm from @entity197 , @entity3 , and i have never touched a hockey stick ( although those other " northern " states certainly have excellent puck - handling abilities )			0
@entity62 also has a thriving cultural community , is home to 19 @entity205 companies and has a cuisine all its own that is not based on processed foods			1
and , at the moment -- it has what many polite @entity8 ca n't abide by -- attitude			1
you know , @entity46 nice			0
definition ? as my pal from @entity42 puts it , " sarcastic , pretentious and exclusionary			0
arrogant @entity46 , " @entity45 joked			0
" that 's what everyone thinks of when they think of @entity46			0
right ? no , again , this is n't about being better			0
it 's not a relative thing			0
it 's just i think there are a lot of great things happening in @entity46			0
it 's not being recognized			0
i think it 's important for the reasons we 've discussed that there is recognition of what we have to offer			1
and so it 's just putting forth our story			0
it 's not trying to make it look better than it is			0
it 's not comparing ourselves to anyone else			0
" i do n't know if @entity188 will be successful , but i do understand why he wants @entity46 to define @entity46			0
you do n't attract the best and the brightest with " friendly			0
" " there is a competition for talent , " @entity45 said			0
" and it 's a national competition , even an international competition			0
" maybe @entity3 should join the rebranding club and become " @entity247			1
" ' cause you know what ? i may be friendly and hard - working , but i 'm not simple			0
so stop asking me if i 've ever gone " cow tipping			0
" or i just might go all @entity46 on you .			0
