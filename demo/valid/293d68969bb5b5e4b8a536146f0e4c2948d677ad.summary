@entity1 investigators found antidepressants in the apartment of @entity6 co-pilot @entity5 this week , according to published reports			1
@entity8 , a @entity1 newspaper , cited an unidentified senior investigator who said @entity5 suffered from a severe " psychosomatic illness " and @entity1 police seized prescription drugs that treat the condition			1
@entity5 suffered from a " severe subjective burnout syndrome " and from severe depression , the source told @entity8			1
the @entity17 also reported that antidepressants were found during the search of his apartment			1
@entity2 has not been able to confirm the reports			2
investigators continued to work saturday to piece together the secret life of @entity5 , who officials say was hiding an illness from his employers			1
he had been declared " unfit to work " by a doctor			0
they were expected to question his relatives , friends and co-workers as they try to pin down what could have prompted the seemingly competent and stable co-pilot to steer a jetliner into a mountainside on tuesday			2
as their efforts continued , dozens of people attended a remembrance ceremony for the victims of the crash at a church in a nearby town , @entity46			0
there were 150 people on board @entity49 , including @entity5			1
relatives of the victims and local residents also gathered saturday afternoon by a simple stone memorial set up near the crash site , in the village of @entity57			0

much attention has focused on @entity5 's state of mind , with some media reports speculating that he may have had mental health issues			1

the @entity17 and the @entity78 , citing unnamed sources , reported friday that @entity5 suffered from mental illness and kept his diagnosis concealed from his employer			1

according to those unnamed officials , @entity5 also was being treated for psychological issues			1
other media reports indicate he was treated for depression			2
@entity5 passed his annual pilot recertification medical examination in summer 2014 , a @entity1 aviation source told @entity2			1
an official with @entity99 , which owns @entity6 , said the exam only tests physical health , not psychological health , and that if @entity5 had vision problems that would have been discovered during the tests			2
" we ca n't believe it			0
if anything was wrong with his eyes during the physical exam we would have known , " the official says			0
the @entity99 official also said the company was never given any indication @entity5 was depressed , and that if he went to a doctor on his own he would have been required to self - report if he had been deemed unfit to fly			1
a @entity73 clinic said he 'd gone there twice , most recently on march 10 , " concerning a diagnosis			0
" but the @entity118 said it had not treated @entity5 for depression			2
@entity1 investigators said they still have interviews and other work to do before they can reveal what they gleaned from the records found in the apartment and at his parents ' home in the town of @entity130			1
but the fact that investigators found " ripped , recent medical leave notes , including for the day of the offense , leads to the preliminary conclusion that the deceased kept his illness secret from his employer and his professional environment , " prosecutors said			1

authorities left @entity5 's apartment friday night with boxes of papers and evidence folders after spending about 90 minutes inside			1

@entity188 declined to say anything else , other than the family wanted time to grieve			0
the pilot has not been named by @entity1 authorities			2
