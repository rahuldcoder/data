the cost of college has rapidly increased over the past 30 years			0
students today face annual costs , between tuition and living , that can easily exceed $ 10,000 at a community college , $ 18,000 at a public four - year college ( in - state ) , and $ 40,000 at a private four - year school			2
it 's unsurprising that today 's students often graduate with large debt loads			2
more than two - thirds of students graduate with debt			2
and the average amount of debt owed is about $ 30,000			0
given the cost of college , students and families need to know that they 're making a good investment			1
that 's why we need to move to a system where we measure learning outcomes , not just time spent in a classroom accumulating credits			1
a college degree is the only sure path to middle - class security , and because young people and their parents know that , the cost of college , and the availability of loans and other aid , has become a powerful political issue			0
but for all the attention paid to the price of college , we have n't given enough thought to whether students and their families are getting their money 's worth			1
is @entity49 higher education worth the price ? are students and their families getting what they 're paying for ? there 's plenty of evidence that for many of them , the answer is no. in 2006 , a government study found that nearly 70 % of college graduates could not perform basic tasks like comparing opposing editorials			1
in a 2011 book , " academically adrift , " researchers studied 2,000 students at two dozen universities over four years and found that 45 % of them showed no significant gains on a test of critical thinking , complex reasoning , and communication skills after two years of college			2
even at the end of four years , 36 % of the students had n't gained those skills			2
given the evidence , maybe it 's not a surprise that employers are n't impressed by recent college graduates			0
employers want the skills that higher education says it provides to students : the ability to critically think , communicate , work in a team , write effectively , and adapt			1
yet only about one - quarter of employers say that colleges and universities are doing a good job in preparing students effectively for the challenges of today 's global economy			2
a recent @entity96 poll found that only 11 % of business leaders strongly agreed that college graduates have the skills necessary to succeed on the job			0
in addition to money , these graduates have spent hours and hours in classrooms and taking tests , but the time does n't seem to have translated into learning			1
why is this ? perhaps it 's as simple as this : we measure education in terms of time , rather than learning			1
a four - year degree attests that you have acquired 120 credits			0
that 's an accidental result of the credit hour system , which was created by philanthropist @entity120 more than 100 years ago , for the purpose of providing struggling professors with pensions			0
at the turn of the 20th century , @entity120 created a $ 10 million free pension fund to help professors retire			0
the @entity126 , which was set up to administer the fund , determined that only " full - time " faculty would qualify for pensions , which they defined as teaching 12 " credit units , " with each unit equal to one hour of faculty - student contact time per week , over a 15 - week semester			2
while originally a narrow measure of faculty workload , the credit hour quickly morphed into much more			2
the @entity126 warned against using the credit hour as a proxy for student learning , but the temptation of an easy - to - understand and seemingly standardized measure was too great to resist			1
it just made organizing the whole higher education enterprise much easier			1
if credit hours truly reflected a standardized unit of learning , they would be fully transferable across institutions			2
an hour in @entity147 is an hour in @entity148			0
but colleges routinely reject credits earned at other colleges , suggesting that even though they use credit hours themselves , they know they are not a reliable measure of how much students have learned			1
many students , however , believe the fiction that the credit hour is a standardized currency and assume that credits will transfer from one school to the next			2
this is an unfortunate and costly assumption , as community college students in @entity163 will tell you			2
until recently , @entity163 students with an associate degree typically lost between 21 and 24 credits when transferring to a four - year state school			2
that 's a year of time and money lost			2
given that nearly 60 % of students in the @entity49 attend two or more colleges , the nontransfer of credits has huge costs , not only to individuals , but also to the federal government and states that are financing this duplicative classroom time			1
if higher education does n't trust its own credits , why should anyone else ? and @entity163 students are n't alone ; transfer students across the country lose credits , which lengthens their time to get a degree			1
so we have two problems : students who have earned credits -- at great expense in time and money -- ca n't use or transfer them			1
others who have accumulated costly credits have n't learned much			0
and then there 's a third dimension : millions of people who have learned a great deal have no " credit " because they learned it at the wrong place — that is to say , not at a " college			0
" someone who has spent the last 10 years working as a nurse 's aid in a hospital who decides to go get a nursing degree has to start from scratch , taking introductory courses he could probably teach , because colleges treat those without credits as blank slates			0
employees at a biotech company with a high - quality on - the - job training program might learn more than someone in a two - year college science program , but unless this training is attached to an accredited institution of higher learning , the learning wo n't " count			1
" for the millions of adult workers looking to retrain and reskill , the focus on time rather than learning , especially when between family and work , their time is scarce , is a daunting proposition			1
state and federal governments add to the problem , because while they spend hundreds of billions on higher education each year , most of it is for time served , in the form of credit hours , rather than learning achieved			1
we need to stop counting time and start counting learning			1
what could that look like ? we do n't have to wonder ; some schools are experimenting with measuring learning rather than time — some for decades			1
one relatively new program is @entity258 's @entity257 , or @entity259 , an online " competency - based " associate of arts degree aimed at working adults			0
the program has no courses , no credit hours and no grades			0
the school has broken down what students with a degree from @entity259 should know and be able to do , what it calls competencies			0
@entity259 worked closely with employers to identify the competencies employers were looking for , like communication , critical thinking and teamwork			0
then faculty designed real - world tasks and projects to determine whether students had mastered each competency			0
unlike in credit - hour courses , @entity259 has no seat - time requirements			0
students can move through the program as quickly as they can demonstrate mastery of the competencies			0
someone who worked at a @entity292 firm might whiz through the communications competencies and spend more time on the math competencies			0
and the faster students can progress , the less they will ultimately pay			0
students pay $ 1,250 for all - they - can - learn in six months			0
this means they can spend their precious time and money learning what they do n't already know , rather than wasting it on what they already do			1
students at @entity259 can be confident that their time and money are well spent and , at the end , they will have a very clear picture of what they know and can do			1
@entity259 is not the only one to offer this to students , nor the only model			0
hundreds of schools , from @entity318 to the @entity319 to @entity320 , are looking to offer competency - based certificate , associate , and baccalaureate degree programs			0
how are universities staying afloat financially with such low tuition ? in many cases , the answer is surprisingly simple — and , sadly , not commonplace in higher education — by focusing on what students need in order to , wait for it , learn			1
fancy amenities , great football teams and sprawling college campuses may bring attention , but they have little to nothing to do with student learning			0
some competency - based programs do n't focus on research -- faculty are hired for specific expertise , like curriculum design , @entity345 literature or advising			0
other programs use technology and data analytics to help students and faculty understand where students are doing well and where they are struggling			0
this allows for more targeted , personalized support by faculty			0
there is , however , a downside for students : self - paced competency - based programs do not fit in neatly with the historically time - based credit hour , making it difficult for students in these types of programs to receive state and federal support			1
without access to these dollars , the programs will remain one - offs and unavailable to the majority of @entity49 who could use them			1
only recently has the federal government recognized the role it could play in encouraging the move from seat time to learning by redirecting some of its nearly $ 150 billion - plus financial aid budget			1
the @entity49 @entity380 is encouraging innovation by colleges looking to experiment with alternatives to the credit hour , and there is strong bipartisan interest in both the @entity387 and @entity388 to explore innovative ways of paying for learning , rather than time			1
as higher education becomes increasingly necessary and expensive , measuring time rather than learning is a luxury that students , taxpayers and the nation can no longer afford			1
paying for what students learn and can do , rather than how or where they spent their time , would go a long way toward providing students and the nation with desperately needed , high - quality degrees and credentials .			1

is @entity49 higher education worth the price ? are students and their families getting what they 're paying for ?
@entity412 : the big problem is that we measure education in terms of time , rather than learning
