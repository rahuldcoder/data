@entity2 at times , he got raucous applause during his speech in @entity6 on tuesday			0
but the reactions to @entity10 prime minister @entity9 's message that may matter most came in @entity10 and @entity11 -- where emotions ran high , both in support and in opposition			1
in an address before the @entity16 punctuated by one - liners , @entity9 claimed that ongoing talks about @entity11 's nuclear program " would all but guarantee that @entity11 gets nuclear weapons , lots of them			1
" he portrayed @entity11 's leaders as untrustworthy and bloodthirsty , intent on annihilating @entity10 and threatening its allies			1
that viewpoint , not surprisingly , did n't play well in @entity26			0
while the speech was n't carried live , @entity11 quickly pounced with heated condemnations of @entity9 and characterized him as a liar			1
tv banners labeled the speech an example of " @entity33 , " with commentators saying that it humiliated @entity36 president @entity35 and deepened the wedge between @entity10 and its longtime allies			1
" this speech was a sign of the weakness and extreme isolation of radical groups , " @entity40 spokeswoman @entity39 said of what she called " a deceitful theater play			1
" " ... the continued lies of @entity9 regarding the aims and intentions of the peaceful nuclear program of @entity11 are repetitive and sickening , " she said			1
the reaction in @entity10 was more diverse , albeit predictable , reflecting the divisions there ahead of its march 17 election			1
@entity55 -- the @entity56 chairman hoping to become @entity10 's next prime minister -- said that @entity9 's speech , " as impressive as it may be , did not prevent the @entity11 ' nuclear program " nor did it impact talks now underway in @entity61 , @entity62 , to address it			1
what the speech did accomplish , according to @entity55 , is " greatly undermine ... the relationship between @entity10 and the @entity36 , " with @entity35 opposing @entity9 's speech as a political move that threatened to thwart the nuclear talks			1
" it will not change the position of ( @entity35 's ) administration and will only broaden the crisis of our great friend and our strategic ally , " @entity55 said of the speech			0
" that price , we will have to pay			0
" on the other side of the debate are people such as @entity82 , a former @entity10 deputy defense minister			2
" prime minister @entity9 sounded the alarm for the survival of our country , " @entity82 said from @entity2			2
and i am very proud of our prime minister , ... who said exactly what we feel : it is a bad deal			0
" the speech and the reactions to it came ahead of a march 24 deadline in which negotiators from six world powers , plus @entity11 , are trying to reach a long - term deal about @entity11 's nuclear program			1
that looming date is why @entity9 said he was compelled to address @entity16 at the invitation of house speaker @entity100 ( and without the advance knowledge of @entity35 )			2
prior to boarding a plane sunday in @entity103 , the prime minister called his foray to @entity6 " a crucial trip , even a historical one			0
" the @entity11 nuclear deadline is n't the only one looming for @entity9 , or even the most immediate one			1
because of @entity10 elections in two weeks , the man who has called himself the " messenger of all the people of @entity10 " might not be that for much longer			1
while it happened some 6,000 miles away , his speech in @entity6 on tuesday could sway hearts and minds back home -- some admiring his strong leadership in protecting @entity10 and others , like @entity55 , upset over how he has roiled relations with @entity35 and undermined peace efforts			1
given @entity10 election guidelines , tv networks pulled @entity55 's speech from air for fear it could be construed as campaigning			1
@entity9 's remarks were on a 5 - minute delay for the same reason			2
@entity131 said he is " totally " convinced @entity9 primarily aimed to speak to voters at home as much as to affect the @entity36 government 's decisions on @entity11			1
" i think this is a classic move of distracting the voters from domestic issues to foreign policy , " @entity131 said in @entity2			0
a fellow @entity10 citizen , @entity139 , disagrees			2
she thinks that @entity9 had every right to make his case in @entity6 if he believes an @entity11 deal could affect @entity10 's future			1
" he 's giving a speech on a topic he knows a lot about and is important to us , " @entity139 said			0
" but it 's still just a speech			0
" given longstanding issues with the @entity152 territories and the fact that @entity10 is surrounded by nations with predominantly @entity156 populations , @entity10 leaders have ample experience with being isolated and on the defensive			2
they 've also proven a willingness time and again to act out , if they feel doing so will safeguard their national security			0
@entity11 has been a case in point			2
@entity9 has been the loudest voice in speaking about international efforts aimed at preventing @entity11 from developing a nuclear weapon			1
if the rest of the world ca n't act to stop this from happening , he 's suggested , then @entity10 will			2
there 's precedent about how that might be done : @entity10 bombed @entity173 's nuclear reactor in 1981			2
at the time , then - prime minister @entity174 drew a line in the sand , essentially vowing that no @entity10 enemy could develop weapons of mass destruction and that @entity10 would defend itself " with all the means at our disposal			2
" that mentality is what appears to be driving @entity9 , who has been adamant and consistent in expressing his distrust of @entity11 ( whose supreme leader , ayatollah @entity186 , tweeted last year that @entity10 should be " annihilated			1
" ) the prime minister has been just as forthright in challenging international efforts to strike a deal with @entity26 , an effort that 's been accelerated since a more conciliatory @entity191 became @entity11 's president in 2013			2
several interim agreements have been made in recent months , though a long - term pact so far has been elusive			0
the @entity62 talks aim to bridge " gaps " between the various parties , with @entity11 foreign minister @entity196 telling @entity3 on tuesday that " we 're starting to move forward , but it 's a lot of work			2
" so is @entity9 having a disruptive effect on these negotiations ? " he 's trying to , " @entity196 said			0
" but i do n't think trying to create tension and conflict helps anybody			0
" one thing that @entity9 has certainly done is get the attention of @entity11			1
news about what happened in @entity6 was the biggest item in @entity11 media and high on the minds of people on the streets of @entity26			0
in addition to citizens and tv commentators , @entity11 officials took notice as well			0
but that does n't mean they are taking much stock in what @entity9 said			0
@entity224 , @entity11 's vice president for environmental affairs , told @entity225 from @entity226 that she did n't think @entity9 's opinion " carries much weight			1
" " they are making their efforts to derail the deal , " @entity224 said of @entity10 officials			0
" but i think the more logical lobbies on both sides are looking forward to a solution			0
" there is a widespread opinion in @entity11 that @entity9 has long been singularly intent on going after @entity11 , even before he started his second stint as prime minister in 2009			1
his position is often conflated with that of the @entity36 , a view that could be exacerbated by the loud reception @entity9 got as he entered the chamber of the @entity36 @entity245 on tuesday and all the times cheers and applause interrupted his speech			1
of course , just because @entity11 are mindful of what @entity9 said does n't mean they will change their minds			1
changing minds in @entity10 , ahead of the coming election , is another matter			2
whether tuesday 's speech will do that ca n't be ascertained until there 's credible polling after his remarks , or arguably once citizens go to the polls in two weeks			0
until then , polls from various @entity10 news outlets suggest a tight race			0
some project @entity9 's @entity266 party winning fewer seats than the so - called @entity269 alliance opposing him , though exactly who will end up as prime minister depends on which parties join forces after the votes are cast			0
most @entity10 do n't think that @entity9 has any hope of impacting opinions and policies out of @entity11 with his speech , @entity277 professor @entity276 said			1
but many are worried about what @entity276 calls the worst crisis in the decades - long relationship between @entity10 and the @entity36 , with tuesday 's speech doing little to help change the perception " there is very little trust between " @entity35 and @entity9			1
speaking from @entity2 , @entity131 said he understands the depth of this division but does n't think the damage is irreparable			0
" the connection between @entity10 and the @entity36 goes so deep and is on so many levels , " he said			0
" yes , we 're going through a bad time			0
but we 'll get over it			0
