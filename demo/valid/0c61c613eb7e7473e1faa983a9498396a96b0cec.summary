@entity0 if you live in @entity3 and have n't watched -- or at least heard about -- " @entity5 , " you must have been living under a rock			1
the almost two - hour documentary on air pollution in @entity3 produced by a famous tv journalist has quickly gone viral since its online release saturday , clocking millions of views on various video sites and stirring ferocious debates across @entity3 cyberspace			1
the air pollution that 's choking @entity14 here are five things to know to put the phenomenon in context : the slickly produced video shows journalist @entity19 presenting a comprehensive slide show , intercutting with fast - paced footage of her travels across @entity3 and the rest of world , to find answers to three questions : what is smog , where does it come from and what can be done to tackle it ? as shocking levels of air pollution continue to choke much of @entity3 regularly , the video has struck such a chord with the audience that , in two short days , it 's easily attracted over 100 million views -- a hugely impressive number even in the world 's most populous nation			1
many internet users have compared it to " @entity44 , " the @entity46 - winning documentary on former @entity49 vice president @entity48 's effort to raise awareness on the dangers of global warming			1
@entity19 , 39 , was already a household name before last weekend thanks to her career at @entity55 , the state - run national broadcaster			2
as a long - time cctv anchor and investigative reporter , @entity19 stood out from her peers by covering sensitive topics -- ranging from the environment to homosexuality -- in a country where many journalists at state media stay away from such potential landmines			1
her choice of stories and style of reporting -- calm but tenacious -- have earned her legions of fans nationwide -- with some nicknaming her " the goddess " for her elegance and intelligence on air			2
plenty of detractors , however , consider her a leading elitist voice for the country 's liberal intellectuals			0
after writing a best - selling autobiography chronicling her time at @entity55 , @entity19 quit her job last year to take care of her daughter , who had been born with a tumor			0
declaring a personal war against smog as a worried mother , @entity19 tries to dig deep in her self - funded documentary			1
with her former cctv connections opening doors , she followed and interviewed top environmental and energy officials and experts in @entity3 -- and received surprisingly candid responses			2
while there is no obvious hero in the video , the villain seems to be clear			0
a former chief engineer of the state - owned oil conglomerate @entity102 brushes off @entity19 's suggestion that his powerful industry -- which oversees pollution standards for itself and has rendered environmental authorities toothless -- should become more socially responsible			1
tracing the main source of tiny and dangerous pollutants in @entity3 to extremely inefficient energy exploration and use , @entity19 sees the solution in dismantling entrenched interests of the state energy sector -- and also appeals to the public for less reliance on cars and more proactive reporting of polluters			2
admiration from celebrity and ordinary viewers -- many said to be moved to tears -- poured in almost immediately			0
in countless reposts of the video links , people praise @entity19 for her courage to address the sensitive topic head on and spread the knowledge to the masses			0
one text message of gratitude to @entity19 from the new minister of environmental protection -- who had been appointed only a day earlier -- has fueled suspicion among her critics that the video was nothing more than a government pr move			0
they point to the positive coverage of the video 's massive online launch across state media , including an in - depth interview with @entity19 on the website of @entity146 , the ruling @entity147 's official newspaper			2
also , the timing : the video was released just days ahead of @entity3 's annual parliament session , during which legislators are expected to rubber - stamp the @entity147 leadership 's policy agenda			1
president @entity155 had declared keeping the sky blue in the country as a top priority			0
some argue that the energy industry makes a convenient political target , as @entity155 's ongoing anti-corruption campaign had netted a former senior leader whose power bases included the state oil sector			0
others even see the video as propaganda to prepare people for mass layoffs in overbuilt and inefficient state industries as the government restructures the economy			0
questions have also arisen on the science in the video -- including @entity19 's apparent linking smog to her baby daughter 's tumor			0
and the cacophony surrounding it seems to have caught even @entity3 's seasoned censors off guard			1
heated arguments have raged online , including blaming pollution on @entity3 's political system due to its lack of accountability			1
by late sunday night , although the video remained online , all mention of it had been scrubbed from homepages of web portals and news sites			0
with discussions on the video shifting to social media , a common consensus seems to have emerged : love it or hate it , @entity19 's documentary has stirred an important debate in a country where authorities censored air pollution data from the @entity49 embassy as recently as november			1
some internet users have compared " @entity211 " phenomena to the discussion over " the dress " â€” you can fight over the color but what 's important is that it 's being talked about .			0
