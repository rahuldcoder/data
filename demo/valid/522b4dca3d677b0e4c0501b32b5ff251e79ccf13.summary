after enduring about four days at sea under stressful conditions , @entity0 , an @entity2 elephant , escaped during a circus performance , crushing her trainer to death and injuring dozens of others while storming through the streets of @entity12			1
@entity0 suffered a slow and painful death after being hit by a barrage of bullets fired by police officers			1
that incident happened 20 years ago , but the welcome announcement last week by @entity19 -- parent company to @entity20 -- that it plans to retire elephants from its circuses by 2018 is a reminder of how that controversy lingers			1
in analyzing the horrific experience involving @entity0 , it was reported that the elephant had been rebellious before she arrived on our shores , and she is said to have had a history of acting out and being unpredictable			1
and though she was not submissive and was difficult to train , her owners sent her to @entity12 anyway			1
sadly , performing animals in circuses and traveling shows are too often subjected to inhumane conditions , especially in their training			1
reward - based training takes time and patience , which are things that many circus trainers do not have			1
instead , these trainers frequently resort to other inhumane means , involving beating the animals , using electrical prods , depriving them of food , chaining them and other brutal methods to force the animals into submission			2
following this sort of brutal training , the animals may appear tame , but they are still wild and their original wild instincts will appear if provoked			2
meanwhile , animals that are no longer useful to the circus or traveling shows due to age or temperament may be given away or sold to other less reputable organizations			2
they lack proper veterinary care , and what little quality of life they did have is diminished further			2
the welfare of the animal is not taken into account			2
rather than being treated as a commodity by the owner , animals should be protected and well cared for			2
@entity20 and @entity20 has said it prides itself on providing a healthy environment for animals			0
yet whatever provisions they may make , the reality is that circuses are particularly unsuited to meet the unique needs of elephants			1
these extremely intelligent animals live in large family groups when in the wild , and they form close social ties with other elephants			1
but the circus environment keeps them isolated and provides little to no interaction with their own species			0
their herd - like behavior is ignored when they are being trained to perform			0
these very social animals , simply put , should not be living in solitary confinement			0
animal welfare advocates have often been criticized as being against " fun			0
" we are told that circuses and traveling shows are about education			1
but what could one possibly learn about animals from watching these shows ? observing wild animals perform unnatural tricks while dancing in tutus only teaches the public that the sole purpose of animals is our entertainment			0
are these really the values we want our children to learn ? wildlife sanctuaries and accredited zoos should exist for conservation , preservation and propagation of species and for public education			0
this is where learning should occur			0
wild animals should be permitted to exist undisturbed in their natural environments , and when they must be confined , it should be in a natural setting consistent with their physical and behavioral needs			0
this is the proper setting for education and study			0
@entity20 has come a long way in its thinking , and for that we congratulate the company for its decision to move the elephants to its sanctuary in @entity140			1
rather than fighting the many cities and counties that have taken steps to pass anti-circus and anti-elephant ordinances , the company instead is putting its resources toward the study and protection of elephants			1
with this step , we look forward to the day that it , and other circuses , phase out all wild animals , including the lions and tigers that also are featured in their shows			1
after all , wild and exotic animals are not meant to entertain us			0
the @entity159 feels strongly about the humane treatment of all animals , whether domesticated or wild			0
our organization , like others in the animal welfare movement , seeks to prevent any practice that might produce pain , stress , injury or suffering to any animal			0
this is an important part of creating a more humane society -- for people and all animals .			0
