@entity5 in a sea of @entity3 parties campaigning at @entity4 , @entity0 was the star attraction			1
but this powerful new face in @entity10 politics is not @entity3			1
while he is an @entity10 citizen , the charismatic 41 - year - old lawyer is of @entity13 descent -- one of 1.6 million @entity10 arabs living in @entity10			1
under @entity0 's leadership , @entity10 's tiny , splintered @entity15 parties have teamed up for the first time to form a slate known as the @entity19			1
come election day on tuesday , they are poised to take as many as 15 seats			1
this could potentially make them the third - largest party in the @entity26 after @entity29 's @entity28 party and his main rival , the @entity32 coalition , potentially giving them the balance of power			1
it is a game - changer , giving a significant voice to one - fifth of the population that has long complained of being treated as second - class citizens			0
his most immediate goal is to deny a new term to @entity29 , who he says has led the " most racist government in history			0
" " @entity29 says the danger to @entity10 is not @entity13 in the @entity45 , but rather @entity10 in @entity10			1
what is that telling me as a citizen of @entity50 ? " he asked in an interview on saturday			0
" with 15 seats in the @entity26 , no one will ever be able to ignore us again			1
" until now , @entity15 parties have failed to unite because of deep ideological differences			1
they run the spectrum from communist to @entity59			0
but a law passed by the last @entity26 , sponsored by the right - wing party of foreign minister @entity62 , raised the threshold of votes a party must receive to be admitted to the @entity26			2
many believed @entity62 's goal was to push the @entity15 parties out of the @entity26			1
it 's a theory that was given credence when , in recent televised debate , @entity62 warned @entity0 , " you are here for now			2
" " why are you even here ? " @entity74 said to @entity0			2
baiting him by accusing him of " representing terror groups , " @entity62 turned to @entity0 and said , " you 're not wanted here			2
" @entity0 politely noted that his @entity19 was polling well ahead of @entity62 's party			2
" i 'm very wanted in my homeland , " he said			0
" i 'm part of the scenery			0
" with that calm , dignified response , @entity0 attracted political star status among @entity3 and @entity10 alike			1
at the @entity4 forum , event students campaigning for the @entity85 and the left - wing @entity86 wanted to take selfies with him			0
more importantly , he has given hope to the 1.6 million @entity13 who hold @entity10 citizenship that they might finally enjoy social and economic equality			1
in the @entity96 neighborhood of @entity50 where @entity0 grew up , the shopkeepers and restaurant owners welcome him as a native son			2
@entity0 goes door to door with the ease of a natural politician , speaking about the importance of turning out to vote to ensure the @entity19 gets enough seats to change the face of the @entity10 government			1
over hummus and stuffed vegetables , he speaks about a 10 - year plan to close the social gaps between @entity10 's @entity3 and its @entity15 population , speaking about issues such as education , housing , employment for women , public transportation in @entity15 towns and recognition of unrecognized @entity119 communities in the @entity120			1
growing up , he says he identified with @entity121 but as he got older , he began to feel he should follow in the footsteps of @entity123 with a large block in parliament , @entity0 says he would have a greater platform to press for better treatment of @entity13 in the occupied territories and to speak out about the need for a @entity13 state living beside @entity10			1
" what makes people vote is the hope of change , " he said			0
" we have been ceding hope again and again			0
but we are 20 % of the population			0
we can prevent the right from forming a government			0
" there is some skepticism here that @entity10 will finally have a say in how the government is run , but most are hopeful			2
sitting on a stoop chopping celery stalks for the grocery store across the street , @entity145 says @entity0 is a good spokesman for @entity13 living inside @entity10			1
" we 've asked for so many rights we do n't we wo n't get , " @entity150 says			0
" the big eat the small			0
but united , we can be strong			0
this is a good first step			0
" if , as many expect , @entity28 or @entity85 fail to strike deals with smaller parties to get the 61 seats needed to form a government , they may be forced to join together in a " national unity " government			2
that would make the next biggest group of parties , and @entity0 , the official opposition			2
it 's a position he says he would prefer over joining an @entity10 government , which he says dedicates a large chunk of its budget to policies that discriminate against the @entity13			1
the prime minister is required to brief the leader of the opposition at least once a month on diplomatic and security matters			0
@entity0 would be entitled to a seat on @entity10 's foreign affairs committee in the @entity26 and is obligated to address the @entity26 after every speech by the prime minister			1
he would also protected by the @entity179 security service			0
he would have the ear of foreign leaders , who would reach out and meet with him to hear his views			0
@entity0 says he needs the help of @entity10 jews , who he hopes one day will become a greater voice in the cause of social justice for all @entity10			1
" arabs alone can not make a democracy strong			0
it has to be @entity10 and @entity3 , " he says			2
" my dream is one day we will build a real @entity15 - @entity3 party , and i tell @entity3 to come join us and build a true democratic party in this country			0
" it 's a message that resonates back at @entity4 , where some @entity3 students are joining the fight against what they call institutional discrimination in @entity10			2
" it is not only a struggle of the @entity13 minority living in @entity10			1
it is the struggle of the @entity13 minority together with democratic @entity3 like myself , " says @entity205 , a student with the @entity3 communist @entity206			0
it 's not a vision shared by most in @entity10 , but @entity0 's message to students is " this is your chance			1
" by finding their voice and using their vote , he says , they can make the dream of equality a reality .			0

@entity0 is a new face in politics : he is an @entity10 citizen and a charismatic lawyer of @entity13 descent
under @entity0 's leadership , @entity10 's tiny , splintered @entity15 parties have teamed up
they are poised to take as many as 15 seats in the @entity26
