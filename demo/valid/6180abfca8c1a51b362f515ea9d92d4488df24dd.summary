the national office of @entity3 fraternity changed its tune			1
just two weeks ago , the national office condemned a racist chant that resulted in the shutdown of the @entity9 @entity3 chapter , saying , " the national fraternity does not teach such a racist , hateful chant , and this chant is not part of any education or training			1
" the fraternity brothers probably " learned the song from fellow chapter members , " @entity3 said			1
but in a friday statement , the @entity3 national office said otherwise			1
the @entity9 chapter , @entity3 said , " likely learned a racist chant while attending a national leadership school about four years ago			1
" the fraternity invites hundreds of leaders to a six - day conference every year , @entity3 said			1
" while attendees have little social time , there are occasions when participants can gather socially , " the statement said			0
" [ executive director blaine ] @entity33 said it is likely that during one of these social gatherings , some members shared the racist song that was recorded on video at the @entity9 and shared through social media earlier this month			2
" @entity33 said the organization has no evidence the chant is widespread across the fraternity 's 237 groups			2
" our investigation to date shows no evidence the song was widely shared across the broader organization , " @entity33 said			0
" the song is horrific and does not at all reflect our values as an organization			0
" but @entity9 president @entity55 , in revealing details of the university investigation on friday , said the chant was an integral part of life in the local chapter			0
" over time the chant was formalized in the local @entity3 chapter and was taught to pledges as part of the formal and informal leadership process , " he said			1
" it is clear that during the four years since the chant was brought to the university campus , its existence was known by recent members and ... it became part of the institutionalized culture of the chapter			2
" @entity55 said " alcohol was readily available at the fraternity house " on march 7 and some chapter members were drinking			0
he also said about a dozen high school students had been invited to the event and " were exposed to the chant			0
" the chant was discovered by the school newspaper and a student organization , which received the video clip via anonymous messages			0
the video shows party - bound students on a bus clapping , pumping their fists and laughing as they chant , " there will never be a ni * * * * @entity3			1
you can hang him from a tree , but he can never sign with me			0
there will never be a ni * * * * @entity3			2
" the university cut ties with @entity3 after the video surfaced , as did the national fraternity , and both launched investigations			1
the university has disciplined fraternity members with punishment ranging from permanent withdrawals to sensitivity training			0
fraternity officers have issued apologies			0
@entity3 issued questions - and - answers about the controversy , noting the fraternity plans to hire a director of diversity and inclusion			2
