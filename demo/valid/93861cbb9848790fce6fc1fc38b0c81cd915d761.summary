when @entity1 spoke last week at the @entity2 in @entity3 , @entity4 , the likely @entity6 presidential hopeful did better than expected			1
of course , that could have been because expectations were so low			0
" when @entity12 was president , it afflicted liberals who thought the chief executive could n't do anything right			0
now that @entity1 might run for president in 2016 , the condition vexes conservatives who believe that when it comes to choosing the @entity6 nominee , the former @entity19 governor is all wrong			1
during @entity1 's speech , a few dozen supporters of sen. @entity25 of @entity26 -- wearing red t - shirts with the words " @entity22 " -- walked out and later blasted @entity1 as insufficiently conservative			1
but what should really count for a lot is that @entity1 is sufficiently competent			1
he 's the grownup in a roomful of extremists who -- as they compare union members to @entity35 ( @entity36 ) or vow to abolish the @entity37 ( @entity38 ) or bash the media ( @entity40 ) -- seem most interested in applause lines			1
@entity1 is a serious person with a serious shot at the presidency , something that you just ca n't say about all republicans who appear to be running			1
as someone who is bilingual and whose wife hails from @entity49 , @entity1 can hit @entity50 , the likely @entity51 nominee , where it hurts by carving into her @entity54 support			1
in his 1998 gubernatorial election , and 2002 re-election , @entity1 received over 60 percent of the @entity54 vote			1
and it 's no secret that , for many @entity59 who might vote for @entity1 , the make - or - break issue is immigration			1
that 's because many @entity59 see immigration as a way of determining a candidate 's character			1
latinos will be watching to see if @entity1 stands up to the pressure from extremists to join the @entity6 's closed border chorus			1
they 're used to being thrown under the bus by politicians who sacrifice @entity59 to gin up support from non-latinos			1
and they wo n't put up with it			0
so which way is @entity1 going to go on immigration ? for many years , he extolled the contributions of immigrants and expressed dismay that elements of his party are closed - minded and mean - spirited on the issue			2
he even acknowledged that , to many , the party is seen as " anti-immigrant			0
" lately , though , @entity1 has injected more nuance into his views -- and turned them mushy in the process			2
on the question of whether undocumented youth should have a path to citizenship , for example , @entity1 at first supported the idea , then he opposed it			2
and most recently , he has said that he could support such a path if @entity99 mandates it			0
on the @entity101 immigration law , @entity1 apparently likes the concept of enlisting local police to be " the eyes and ears " of the border patrol			2
but he has also been sympathetic to critics who worry that this will lead to ethnic profiling of @entity59			2
too often , @entity1 leaves the impression that he 'll say whatever he needs to say to avoid conflict			2
so it was actually refreshing to see @entity1 use his appearance at @entity2 -- which took the form of an onstage interview by conservative talk show host @entity117 -- to once again speak plainly			1
in response to questions , @entity1 emphasized the need to secure the @entity122 border , insisted that immigration policy should be driven by economic concerns and the need for high - skilled immigrants , and reaffirmed support for giving undocumented immigrants driver 's licenses and in - state tuition at public colleges and universities			1
the crowd booed that last one			0
@entity1 criticized president @entity135 's executive actions to prioritize deportations , but also bashed @entity6 in @entity99 for protesting that policy by holding up funds for the @entity139			1
finally , in response to what is often the most contentious aspect of this debate , @entity1 also stressed the need to create a path to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants who are currently in the @entity122			2
" i know there 's disagreement here , " he said			0
" the simple fact is that there is no plan to deport 11 million people			0
we should give them a path to legal status where they work ... and contribute to our society			0
the way @entity1 sees it , the @entity6 is good at being against things but " we have to start being for things again			2
" in response to a heckler , @entity1 stared out into the crowd to address his critic			2
" i 'm marking you down as neutral , " he told the heckler			0
" i 'll look forward to being your second choice			0
in the @entity174 / @entity2 presidential preference straw poll of 3,007 participants , @entity1 came in fifth out of 17 candidates with just 8 percent of the vote			1
first place went to @entity25 , who earned 25.7 percent			0
clearly , @entity1 has a long way to go in convincing conservatives that he 's their best choice			1
but his appearance at @entity2 set exactly the right tone			0
voters in both parties have plenty of candidates telling them what they want to hear just to get their support			0
what they need are more candidates who tell them what they need to hear : the truth			0
that wo n't make the candidates popular			0
but it does make them credible			0
score 1 for @entity1 .			0
