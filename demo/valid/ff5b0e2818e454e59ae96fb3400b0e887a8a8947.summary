@entity0 , @entity1 along the dangerous northeastern border between @entity4 and @entity5 , a wave of terror has people in fear for their lives			1
the ongoing threat from the @entity13 militant group @entity12 means that remote villages and citizens suffer indiscriminate attacks			2
in the ongoing conflict , women and children remain faceless victims of beatings , rape and unwarranted assaults			1
but one courageous woman has dedicated herself to protecting these countless victims			1
@entity26 runs the @entity27 , a group that provides sanctuary , first aid services and valuable health information to numerous displaced women in the region			1
last night , @entity26 's inspiring work was recognized at the esteemed @entity34 awards in @entity0 -- the @entity4 women 's rights activist was the winner in the campaign category			1
@entity2 's @entity38 sat down with the soft spoken and unassuming awards winner , who celebrated her 34th birthday the same day as her win , to discuss her ongoing mission , fighting on in the face of death threats and empowering young girls through education			1
@entity2 : what does this honor mean to you ? @entity26 : i feel good about winning the award -- i will celebrate with the team when i go back home			1
but i will continue to do more and more			2
i hope to show my people how ... to fight for their rights			2
i want to give [ them ] the message to look [ out ] for their futures			2
@entity2 : how did you get involved in women 's rights along the @entity4 - @entity5 border ? @entity64 : i started working with @entity27 in 2006 -- [ back then ] we were just two staff and 10 volunteers and [ now ] there are four staff with 20 volunteers			1
when i first began , i was just doing it in our village and now i move around all over the place up to the @entity5 border			1
on the border , there are many issues women are facing ; small girls are raped or beaten , rival clans fight , maybe because of land or because of outsiders			1
but everyday people are dying			2
they come to the border and physically stop people from crossing over into @entity4			1
you never know who is @entity12 , they look like me and you			2
but they stop people from crossing the border by beating them			1
when [ refugees ] are coming , if they want to cross into @entity4 , they have big , big problems			1
journalism @entity92 , @entity93 ( @entity94 , @entity95 ) arts @entity98 aka @entity97 ( @entity99 ) digital activism freedom of information website @entity102 , managed by @entity103 ( @entity104 ) campaigning @entity26 ( @entity4 ) @entity2 : through your organization , you 've set up shelters along the border and provide relief and medical assistance to refugees			1
@entity64 : yes , when we see them or hear they are suffering there , i go in and find them			2
we take them to @entity119 [ the largest refugee camp in the region ]			0
if i take them to the refugee camp , they will get the assistance there			0
for the ones who have been beaten or raped , i organize for medical assistance			0
@entity2 : and how many women are crossing the border ? @entity64 : there are just so many			1
in @entity5 , they do n't have things there , they do n't have good security , they are just running because of bad security in their country -- mothers with their children , others are young			1
@entity2 : you 've also helped establish a local radio - listening project where women share their experiences and treatment options			1
why did you decide to start this ? @entity64 : it 's about how women are suffering in this place			0
i used to go to villages looking for them -- seeing what problems they are facing and maybe they do n't have the power to talk			0
i go there and talk to them , then i take them to the radio station			0
i share how they have suffered			0
@entity2 : the region is quite unstable			0
is it not dangerous doing this kind of work ? @entity64 : it 's very , very dangerous			1
there is this place called @entity162 , it 's just near the border inside @entity4			1
that place , every time , people are fighting			0
people are just coming from @entity5 to @entity162			1
there is fighting and you might just be walking and they will shoot you			0
but i never faced any problems			0
@entity2 : are you not fearful for your life ? @entity64 : i worry but what can i do ? i have to save my people			0
i have to look for those who are suffering			0
@entity2 : what is the reaction from men about your work ? @entity64 : when i started it was so difficult for me because in our place men are not the same as women			1
men are the ones that talk			0
so when i started this , for example forced marriages , the small girls when they are 13 or 15 they just get married			0
they do not go to school			0
but they have no voice			0
you 'll see a 15 - year - old getting married and in 20 years she 'll come back with children and without anything			2
we go there and we advise them to go to school , advise their parents against forced marriage , tell them to take the children to school , stop circumcision			0
@entity2 : last year your organization identified small arms and light weapons were fueling local violence and spent much of its resources mapping conflict zones			2
you succeeded in creating a regional agreement to stem the illegal arms trade and halt smugglers			0
how did that work ? @entity64 : yes , i would hear there are some gunmen or they want to do something around the villages , or maybe they want to attack the villages and destroy it or take livestock			2
we report it to the police and then sometimes i go with policemen , never alone			0
for now , we do n't have that problem with guns anymore -- they 've stopped			0
