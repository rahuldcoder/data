in november 2002 , the world was captivated by the biggest archaeological discovery ever made relating to @entity3 : a 2,000 year - old ossuary -- or bone box -- bearing the tantalizing inscription in @entity7 : " @entity8 , son of @entity10 , brother of @entity3			1
" if it was true , this was the first physical evidence ever found of @entity3 ' existence			2
and yet , if this amazing ossuary was false , then it was one of the greatest forgeries in history			0
underlying the question of the authenticity of the ossuary is an even bigger theological problem : whether or not @entity3 actually had any brothers			2
though the debate 's origins are ancient , the answer still divides @entity26 and @entity27			2
for @entity26 , @entity28 , @entity10 and @entity3 are a family unit unto themselves			0
yet @entity31 theology also holds that @entity3 was @entity32 's son , born of the virgin -- and that @entity28 did not give birth to other children , divine or otherwise			0
' finding @entity3 ' : @entity36 so who are these " brothers " that the @entity38 mentions ? the rev. @entity39 , author of the book " @entity3 : a pilgrimage , " calls the relationship between @entity8 and @entity3 " very complicated			1
" " he 's called clearly the brother of the @entity45 , and the @entity46 uses the common word for brother , " @entity39 says			0
but @entity26 also believe in @entity28 's perpetual virginity , so @entity39 surmises that @entity8 and the other brothers were @entity10 's children from a prior marriage			1
" it makes sense that @entity10 would have been older and @entity28 was younger , so i see them in a sense as stepbrothers			0
" other @entity31 scholars see @entity8 and @entity3 as cousins , an idea that began in the fourth century , when @entity60 , who translated the @entity61 and the @entity62 into @entity63 , argued the point against the theologian @entity66 , who said @entity28 and @entity10 had other children			1
' finding @entity3 ' : shroud of @entity69 @entity60 countered that these children were instead born to @entity28 , @entity3 ' aunt			0
@entity60 used his linguistic facility to argue that " adelphios , " the @entity46 word used for @entity3 ' brothers and sisters , could refer to cousins , as well as to siblings			2
protestants , however , see @entity3 ' family as free of ambiguity , with @entity28 and @entity10 having several children			0
one of them is @entity3 -- but the question then becomes , which one ? @entity84 , professor of @entity85 at @entity86 , offers the @entity27 view that @entity3 and @entity8 were full brothers , with @entity3 being the elder			1
" @entity62 says nothing about @entity28 being a perpetual virgin , it says she virginally conceived @entity3 , and it certainly implies that she went on to have more children after that , and his brothers and sisters are in fact his brothers and sisters , " @entity84 says			1
is @entity98 in hell ? @entity3 is presented as the older brother who leaves the family and walks about in @entity102 and @entity103 , has a ministry and leaves @entity8 and the other brothers and sisters in charge of the family , according to the scholar			1
what 's more contentious for some @entity27 , is the fact that @entity3 , as the eldest in the family , essentially forsook his obligation as next - in - line to head the family after @entity10 died			1
instead he followed his divine destiny , as ordained by his father in heaven			0
5 things you did n't know about @entity3 that left @entity8 to fill the void			1
whatever he was -- brother , step - brother or cousin -- we know that @entity8 became important in the early @entity125 church because of his relation to @entity3			1
@entity127 , the apostle who transformed the new religion from a local phenomenon into a movement throughout the @entity131 , says as much in his letter to the @entity133 : " then after three years i did go up to @entity134 to visit @entity135 and stayed with him 15 days ; but i did not see any other apostle except @entity8 the @entity45 's brother			0
" @entity8 and @entity135 and @entity127 were the prime movers of this new faith , with @entity8 the leader of the @entity3 followers in @entity134 until he was martyred in 64 ce , forgiving his killers with his last breath , just as his brother @entity3 had done			2
given his importance to the early @entity146 , why would n't he be connected to his brother , or even stepbrother , on the burial box containing his bones ? @entity151 is co-author , with @entity152 , of " finding @entity3 : @entity153			0
: six holy objects that tell the @entity157 of the @entity158			0

the rev. @entity39 , a *catholic* priest , calls the relationship between @entity8 and @entity3 " very complicated . "
@entity84 offers the @entity27 view that @entity3 and @entity8 were full brothers , with @entity3 being the elder .
