@entity1 thousands of veterans who are patients at the @entity4 @entity3 have been waiting months just for an appointment , @entity0 has learned			1
email your story ideas and tips to @entity9			0
what 's more , administrators in charge of the massive @entity4 facility in greater @entity1 may have been hiding wait times , and may have misled @entity15 on the delays and exactly how long veterans are being forced to wait for care , according to new information obtained by @entity0			1
this revelation means that the scandal over delays in care and wait times for veterans , which embroiled the @entity28 @entity27 last year and even led to the resignation of va secretary @entity30 , is apparently not over			2
and the changes promised by the @entity4 and the @entity33 administration may not be working			0
the detailed new evidence comes from the @entity1 @entity4 's own internal documents obtained by @entity0 , and numerous medical and administrative sources confirmed the information			1
it is particularly significant as the @entity4 veterans @entity39 is the nation 's largest @entity4 health care system , caring for hundreds of thousands of @entity28 veterans			1
the @entity4 documents show more than 12,700 appointments , which the @entity4 calls consults , had been waiting more than 90 days to be addressed , as of mid-january			2
even new patients seeking care at the @entity1 va for the first time can wait months to see a doctor there			2
records show on january 15 , more than 1,600 veterans who were new patients were waiting 60 to 90 days for appointments			0
another 400 veterans have waited up to six months , and 64 veterans had been waiting six months to a year for their appointments			2
the documents provided to @entity0 show the lengthy wait times are still happening , within the last several months , and sources say the backlog is happening even now			0
and yet last month , the @entity4 's acting director for the @entity62 overseeing the @entity1 @entity4 told @entity15 that veterans who are new patients there only have to wait a few days for appointments			1
" the average wait time for a new patient right now is about four days , " dr. @entity66 , the acting director of the @entity67 , @entity68 , testified before the @entity69			1
but @entity66 's statement is simply not true			0
according to the @entity1 @entity4 's documents dated january 15 , the actual average wait time for new patients at the @entity4 was 48 days			1
a half - dozen medical and administrative sources inside the @entity4 system corroborate these waits			1
the wait times since then have not changed significantly -- coming down slightly to a wait time of 44 days for new patients as of march 1 , according to another @entity4 document -- and are still roughly 10 times what @entity66 testified they were			1
the delays in appointments are even taking place at @entity1 clinics for mental health , where documents show more than 300 veterans have been waiting more than 30 , 60 , even 90 days for treatment			0
at the congressional hearing , @entity66 was specifically asked about mental health wait times for new patients , a growing national concern as hundreds of veterans are committing suicide every year			0
the uncounted : @entity98 's true toll asked how long the wait time is for mental health at the @entity101 , @entity66 testified that the same number -- a four days ' wait for new patients -- applies for mental health			1
but that is also not true , according to the documents and sources inside the @entity4 who spoke with @entity0			0
a new @entity4 chart shows as of march 1 , new mental health patients in @entity1 are waiting an average 36 days just to get an appointment			2
@entity1 va officials would not talk to @entity0 about the discrepancies but instead sent a statement saying that the " @entity4 and @entity101 nationwide continues to work very hard to get veterans off waiting lists and into clinics to get the care they have earned and deserve			0
" the @entity4 sent @entity0 new " retrospective data " showing primary care average wait times of four days , specialty care wait times of 7.5 days , and mental health wait times of 2.5 days , as of january			1
the @entity4 explained that the chart for new patients obtained by @entity0 " does not include same day appointments or in some cases same week appointments for those veterans who need care quickly ...			2
" new patients , the @entity4 told @entity0 , " typically account for less than 10 % of all veteran appointments and are not representative of the whole patient population			0
" despite the " retrospective data , " the real truth , say the sources @entity0 has interviewed , is reflected in the internal @entity4 documents obtained by @entity0 -- that wait times for many patients at the @entity1 @entity141 extends into weeks and months and are a serious problem			2
this news of continuing delays in @entity1 comes a year after reports of cover - ups and turmoil at the @entity4 , which became a national scandal , where wait times , veterans ' deaths and even secret waiting lists were revealed at @entity4 hospitals across the country			1
@entity15 even passed a new law last fall to help veterans get care more quickly , as a direct result of the scandal			0
and since the scandal , @entity15 has approved $ 16 billion extra for the @entity4 in an attempt to hire more doctors and nurses and to build more facilities			0
the @entity4 removed its 14 - day scheduling goal to discourage engaging in " inappropriate scheduling practices , " and president @entity33 also appointed a new @entity4 secretary , @entity167 , last summer			0
vets not impressed with @entity4 reforms sources in the @entity4 @entity4 say despite the scandal last year , the new secretary , the new laws and all the attention , not much has changed			1
