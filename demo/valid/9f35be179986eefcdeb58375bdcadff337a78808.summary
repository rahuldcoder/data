" every day , we cried " -- these were the words spoken over and over to me by a colleagues as we sat down after another long day for a rare drink in @entity6 , @entity7 's bustling capital			1
she was reminiscing about the period in september and october when the @entity11 outbreak was at its peak			1
" of all the pain that we faced , the cremation was the hardest , " she explained			0
i knew exactly what she meant -- cremation was as far away from the norm for burials in @entity21 as one can imagine			0
as the @entity11 outbreak wanes in @entity7 , it is easy to imagine the heroes as the myriad of foreign doctors , nurses , epidemiologists and logisticians that have come to support the country in their days of need , and yes , these expatriates have definitely brought to bear much knowledge , expertise and resources on controlling the outbreak			1
but there is a group of heroes who are unlikely to make any headlines or be celebrated as such			0
they are the thousands of @entity7 citizens that have gone door - to - door asking questions , looking for the ill , offering advice , day after day , after day for months on end			1
when they do find an ill person who may have @entity11 , they begin the painful process of convincing them that it is safer to be an ebola treatment unit than at home			1
often the question that follows is : " what happened to all those that went in before me ? what happened to them ? " thankfully , @entity7 appears to be on its way back			1
it currently has the lowest numbers of confirmed cases of @entity11 since the onset of the second phase of the outbreak in the middle of last year			1
the streets are full of activity and schools have reopened			0
across the country , there is an unmistakable sense that people are desperate to get on with their lives			2
at the @entity82 , on @entity81 , the main road through @entity6 , the manager sits in the popular caf√© in the front garden			1
most of his guests are still members of the large contingent of development workers from all over the world , or members of the armed forces and police services that form part of the @entity95 military mission in @entity7 , @entity96			1
he admits that while this has been good for business , he would rather have his " normal " clients back			2
@entity6 is an interesting place -- it feels very @entity21			1
the food is familiar -- fish , plantain , rice ... with lots of red pepper			0
the power situation is still very poor and most people in @entity6 rely on generators			2
it has a lovely but underutilized beach front ; the perfect setting for a cold bottle of " club " lager in the evening			0
there are quite a few restaurants and supermarkets -- mostly run by @entity121 entrepreneurs			0
as we drive past the @entity124 " mansion " -- i ask why it looks empty and i am told that there was a fire in it a few years ago and that the renovation is not yet complete			0
president @entity131 uses the office of the @entity133 , and otherwise lives in her private residence , i am told			0
from the outside , with all the horror stories of @entity11 in the popular press , it is easy to imagine @entity7 as a country on the brink , especially with its history of protracted conflicts and civil war			1
but there is nothing further from the truth			0
yes , it was ill prepared for an outbreak of this severity and magnitude , as many other countries would have been , but sometimes there is nothing as powerful as grief to unite people in seeking a better future			0
out of this crisis , must emerge a new country			0
while the stories of dictators , civil war and @entity11 are true , they can not be @entity7 's " single " story			1
with a beautiful beach front right at the heart of the city , there is no reason for @entity6 not to be the favorite destination of @entity21 's emerging middle class			1
with lots of mineral resources , @entity7 has so much potential			2
but , its most obvious resource and probably its most underutilized are its human resources			0
the @entity176 is one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in @entity21 , but has known better times			0
the government of @entity7 needs to think strategically and creatively on how to channel the goodwill of the world and the determination of its people into programs and projects that will put @entity7 on a new trajectory			2
it may be impossible to imagine in 2015 , but one only needs to look east to @entity190 for how a country can emerge from the most tragic of circumstances to become a proud and resilient country			0
@entity7 will be back , but it will take leadership and courage			2
despite the long hours of work , the tedious meetings , the long nights writing reports and re-strategizing , my best memories of @entity6 will be good ones ; of a beautiful county and a resilient people			2
more from @entity21 voices read this : the @entity21 weapons beating @entity11 read this : from surf spots to boardrooms , @entity7 's ill economy fights back the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author .			1
