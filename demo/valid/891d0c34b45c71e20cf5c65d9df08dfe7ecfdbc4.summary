through his work in fashion , @entity0 was drawn to the classic @entity5 style that has seen a revival in the past decade			0
he was turned off by the price tag of @entity12 - made clothing : basic crew - neck tees starting at $ 50 , unembellished selvedge denim jeans priced at $ 250 and up , @entity8 cloth button - downs cut and sewn in @entity14 ranging from $ 150 to $ 300			1
" it 's that effortless design that most guys look good wearing , but it was n't really happening for anyone except at the higher price point , " @entity0 said			2
to help shrink the gap , @entity0 and his @entity14 neighbor , @entity20 , started a business with a goal of lowering the barrier to " made in @entity12 " fashion			1
@entity25 has been up and running since late 2013 , offering a focused collection of @entity12 - made garments			1
prices range from $ 24 for a t - shirt to $ 155 for its most expensive pair of jeans , about 25 % to 50 % less than comparable brands boasting the " made in @entity12 " label			1
how do they keep costs down ? by focusing on just a few items and cutting out the middleman so they can sell directly to customers through their website and storefront in @entity44 , @entity45 , they say			1
with the help of the @entity48 and social media , they have been able to build their brand and find an audience without the help of chains or department stores			1
" it did n't make sense for us to not do it this way , " @entity20 said			2
" maybe that 's us being naive or not thinking like a traditional business manager , but i do n't see how we could have got this started any other way			2
" brands selling directly to customers is nothing new in retail , and it 's still a big gamble for most			1
traditional middlemen such as department stores , chains and boutiques help legitimize brands and expose them to consumers faster than brands may be able to build their own fan bases			2
but some small businesses are finding the cost of that exposure too onerous			2
by selling directly to consumers , brands increase their margins , control inventory based on their own projections and do n't have to worry about returns from retail store customers			1
they also have complete control over pricing and may be able to offer lower prices to consumers , said @entity93 , ceo of market research company @entity94			1
fueled by venture capital investors , there has been strong growth in new direct to consumer brands , and not only in clothing , @entity93 said			2
but very few actually manufacture in the @entity12 because of the high cost of doing business , especially compared with global competitors			2
for @entity25 , manufacturing in the @entity12 is a matter of principle and direct to consumer a means to that end , @entity0 said			2
" it 's that idea of looking at our product and taking pride in creating something from scratch			0
we may not sell 100 million t - shirts , but we can say we 're to create one thing and make it all here and be part of the process , " @entity0 said			2
to make direct to consumer work , @entity25 and other plucky entrepreneurs are mixing aspects of traditional business models with customized approaches to production and marketing , taking on much of the work typically done by outside parties			0
they sell through their own websites and stores , retaining absolute control over branding and merchandising			0
they build audiences through social media , using it as a branding tool and a forum to seek customer feedback on styles and colors , forming relationships in the process			1
but it takes more populating a web store or @entity150 feed with aspirational images of attractive people to reduce margins			0
brands offering specialty products that stand out have a better chance of surviving , depending on the product and its place in the global market , @entity93 said			0
" overall , this is positive for the sustainability of @entity12 manufacturing , but there are many cases in which it will be extremely difficult to have competitive prices when manufacturing here , " he said			1
instead of designing various products in different colors and styles , fledgling brands have found success in getting just a few items right , developing a cult - like following and adding products based on customer feedback			2
it 's a model that has worked for @entity179 and @entity180 , who launched the e-commerce arm of their @entity183 storefront , @entity185 , in 2008 with a button - down shirt for men and women made in the city			1
from day one , they have sold directly to consumers through their website and store , using social media to build a fan base that enjoys geeking out as much as they do over fabric origins and stitching details			1
since then , they have expanded to accessories and footwear , and they offer custom suiting and shirts			0
along the way , they have earned a reputation for offering quality products sourced and made in the @entity12 and @entity209			1
they partner with esteemed brands including shoemaker @entity213 and suit maker @entity215 on products and offer a handful of other brands for sale			0
through social media , @entity180 says , @entity185 has cultivated a fan base interested in the stories behind the brand , its creators and its manufacturing partners			1
their customers see the value in paying more for products made in the @entity12 or @entity209 , and they keep coming back			1
" your product has to be unique , and it has to be something people want , whether it 's filling a void for something people do n't know they want yet , or it 's something you see in market that you could do better , " @entity179 said			0
@entity25 launched with a simple t - shirt , working with a knitter in @entity14 to develop a slub cotton before sending it to a mill outside the city			0
when it sold out , the company started working on a five - pocket selvedge denim jean sourced from @entity247 and cut and sewn in @entity14			2
it 's an a la carte approach to production that takes more time and attention than the full - package manufacturing typically used by larger brands to fill big orders under one roof			1
the upside is that it keeps shipping costs down and allows @entity25 to respond faster to market demands by placing small orders with a quick turnaround			0
@entity261 started out making one pair of jeans at a time in his @entity265 , workshop			0
as demand for @entity269 grew , @entity266 and his wife , @entity267 , scaled up production by partnering with a @entity272 factory that , like most remaining textile manufacturers , had seen better days			0
as the @entity275 learned more about the factory 's history and the town it once supported , they realized it needed more business to create sustainable employment opportunities			0
it was " hipster and naive " of them to think they could make a significant impact with small runs of premium jeans , @entity266 said , and they started pondering new products			0
they tested the waters with a small run of sweatshirts			0
after selling out within days , the couple decided to launch a @entity295 campaign to raise funds for a new business			0
sweatshirts sold under the @entity300 label will be made from organic cotton in the same factory as @entity303			0
unlike @entity303 , which is sold in a few stores , @entity300 will be sold directly to consumers through the company 's website and its brick and mortar store in @entity265			1
cutting out the middleman allows @entity303 to control its brand instead of relinquishing control to wholesalers and create " stability " in terms of sales expectations , @entity266 said			0
" everyone is oddly reliant on each other but not in way that encourages innovation			0
" it also creates a quicker " feedback loop " through which the @entity275 can listen and respond to customer feedback			0
that 's how they heard from people who said they could not afford to support the " made in @entity12 " movement even though they wanted to			1
through @entity300 , whose products range from $ 25 for a tee to $ 85 for a hooded sweatshirt , the @entity275 hope to rehab @entity12 - made style 's reputation as exclusively high - end and inaccessible , she said			1
" there are people who value the idea of @entity12 - made but have never taken the step , " she said			1
" if we can make it for the same price as a @entity343 sweatshirt , hopefully people will see it as easy choice			0

@entity12 - made clothing brands try to cut out middleman , selling directly to consumers
pros include smaller margins that can lower prices for consumers
social media make finding customers easier , but it 's still an *uphill* *battle*
