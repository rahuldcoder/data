a lot of people have ventured to @entity3 over the years in search of some sort of a dream			1
my great - great - grandfather , @entity7 , was one of them			1
i 've looked for this mysterious ancestor before -- in @entity11 , with my younger brother @entity12			0
we were disappointed when our trail ran cold			0
we were left with a cryptic reference to the news that @entity7 had died in @entity17 , @entity3			1
which raised the questions : " what the hell was he doing in @entity3 ? " and " where is @entity3 , anyway ? " roots : our @entity24 it 's certainly a country few of us know much about			1
landlocked by its better - known neighbors , @entity3 is probably best known for being a hideout for escaped nazis and for a succession of truly spectacularly lurid , out - of - a - comic - book dictatorships -- the last being the administration of gen. @entity34			1

when i first looked at the possibility of making a television show there , many years ago , descriptions of the country by visitors were not promising : crime , corruption , counterfeiters , failed institutions , looted banks -- in short , a backwater			0
i thought i 'd use the dubious quest for " @entity54 " as the spine of a show , a framework to investigate one of the least - known nations in the @entity60			2
my crew , looking at various storytelling structures , settled on the terrific film " @entity64 " as a rough template			0
in that film , @entity74 , playing a just - out - of - prison career criminal , voyages to @entity67 in search of answers after the death of his daughter			2
in this week 's " @entity77 " episode , i explore @entity3 ( and my family 's past ) in similar nonlinear fashion			1
it 's an amazing - looking show			0
everybody who worked on it , handcrafted it , is convinced it 's some of their best work			0
what i found out -- about @entity3 , about my family -- surprised me			2
i hope it entertains you .			0
