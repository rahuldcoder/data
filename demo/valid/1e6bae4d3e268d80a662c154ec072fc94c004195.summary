@entity0 , @entity1 two men in blue smocks were mopping up blood spilled in the main entrance to the @entity7 south of @entity0 when we arrived there mid-morning friday			1
the air shook with outgoing rockets and artillery roaring toward the center of the city			1
we were escorted by men from the @entity15 , the biggest and best - organized @entity17 - backed force fighting @entity18			1
as we got out of our car , a man wearing a vest with the emblem of the @entity1 @entity22 beckoned urgently to video journalist @entity24 to come inside			1
he led her to a gurney surrounded by four or five men , some wearing blue disposable surgical gowns , others in dark green military fatigues			1
they were huddled over a man naked to the waist , a thick plastic tube inserted in his side , red with blood , leading to a bottle filling up with more blood			1
the wounded man -- no one knew his name -- had been shot in the head , the chest and the leg			1
the head doctor , in dark green combat fatigues , told me the man was in critical condition			1
all the while , the windows of the building shook from the concussion of the bombardment of central @entity0			1
from the sound , it was clear that artillery and rocket launchers were nearby			1
several other wounded fighters were in the entrance , but their condition was much less grave			1
one , who identified himself as @entity62 , had been shot in the upper thigh , but was fully conscious			1
he told producer @entity65 he had been shot in central @entity0 that morning , recalling at the time he was uncertain whether it was shrapnel or a bullet because the fighting was so intense			1
while @entity24 and @entity65 were doing that interview , i walked around the hospital to see if there was anything else that might help us put together a report			1
it was a ramshackle place , it looked like much of the facility had been in a state of neglect for a while , perhaps because until recently it was in no - man 's land			1
when i went back to see where @entity24 and @entity65 were , i was told @entity24 was down a corridor where an " operation " was about to take place			2
@entity24 was invited to film the operation			2
i found her putting on a surgical gown and blue shoe covers			2
several men rolled a gurney through the corridor in our direction			2
the same critically wounded man was wheeled into a side room			1
he never made it into the operating theater			2
a different set of doctors or medics started working on him , pumping air into his lungs , then applying cpr			2
his chest took a final heave , as the doctors tried to find a pulse , but there was no pulse to find			2
there was no " operation			2
" this was a last , desperate attempt to stop this unknown man from dying			1
his face was yellow and waxy			2
he was dead , but the doctors did n't call time of death , in the meantime , our escorts were calling us to leave , we needed to move to our next destination , which they had told us was the position from which artillery and rocket launchers were at work			2
@entity24 , who was at the far end of the gurney , wedged her way out and we went outside			2
she went to the car , i chatted with a pair of @entity1 journalists in the entrance			2
they had been here for more than two weeks			2
i bade them farewell , and walked toward our car			2
and then , everything changed			2
i heard a commotion behind me , and the doctor i had spoken to before passed me , shouting , " grab all the cameras ! get the cameras ! " " what 's the problem ? " i asked him			1
he did n't provide an explanation			2
" give us your cameras now ! " he barked at me			0
a group of militiamen had surrounded @entity65 , and was insisting he give them his small camera			0
more militiamen , plus some of the hospital staff gathered around him , shouting angrily that all cameras must be surrendered			0
right next to me a tall man with a military shirt over running pants raised his rifle , about to shoot in the air			1
this is going to get very messy , i thought to myself			0
fortunately , cooler heads prevailed and there was no shooting			0
but everyone was very agitated			0
much shouting ensued between our entourage and the local militiamen			0
our chief escort , @entity175 , was gesturing wildly and arguing with them to calm down , but he was n't having much luck			0
he is a commander of the @entity15 , but these men were with the soldiers of the @entity180 ( @entity181 in @entity182 )			0
it 's a separate group , and clearly @entity175 , who was treated with deference by his own men , did n't enjoy the same esteem here			1
in the meantime , i joined @entity24 in our car , concerned that too many of us arguing with this large group would only make matters worse			0
@entity65 was busy negotiating outside the hospital			0
we locked the car doors and did our best to pretend we were simply waiting patiently to move			0
soon a group of men armed with @entity196 assault rifles gathered outside the car , knocking on the window and angrily gesturing that we must give them the camera			0
@entity24 discreetly pulled out the data card with the footage she had just shot and replaced it with an empty one			1
it 's an old trick that sometimes works in situations like these			1
although i could understand everything this crowd was saying , i feigned ignorance			0
this went on for about 45 minutes			0
some in our entourage were trying to keep the crowd from banging on the car windows and wrenching open the locked doors			0
@entity65 hid his small camera in one of the cars and saw the big camera being taken away by several people			0
@entity65 followed the camera to make sure it was safe			0
inside , everyone was shouting , with @entity65 refusing to do anything before someone explained what was going on			0
the armed men wanted the sequence of the dying fighter deleted , and were n't going to take " no " for an answer			1
@entity65 then went inside one of the rooms to carry on negotiations			0
armed men barred @entity65 from leaving the room			0
eventually , @entity65 said we should delete the sequence of the dying man , after our @entity1 security guard had said we needed to do just that -- otherwise , we were in trouble			1
@entity65 looked at the camera and noticed the card was missing			0
a media - savvy member of the @entity247 insisted we were hiding the card with the footage			1
finally @entity65 returned and said that if we did n't hand over the camera there would be trouble			0
the atmosphere was such that we realized that not handing over the camera would make matters much worse			0
so we gave @entity65 the camera and waited			0
a few minutes later , he returned			0
they know the data card is empty			0
they want the one with the pictures , he said			0
so we gave it to him			0
" they do n't know how to delete the pictures of the dying man , " he said			1
so @entity24 went with him inside the hospital to delete the footage of the dying man			1
to cut a long , tense story short , @entity24 did n't delete the footage			1
someone else did , all the footage from the hospital			1
after about an hour and a half , we finally left the hospital compound			0
our escort , @entity175 , was shaken			0
he , and we , were reminded that with all the different armed groups fighting on the @entity0 front , there might be unity against @entity18 , but that 's about where it ends .			1

a @entity2 crew finds medical personnel trying to save a wounded fighter in @entity0
but when the man dies , demands start for the crew 's video footage
