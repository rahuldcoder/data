a decision last week to ax the popular @entity2 chancellor @entity1 rippled into wednesday with demonstrations at the @entity6 campus , powerful alumni denouncing the decision and wealthy donors threatening to withhold funding to the school			1
" it 's a damn shame , " @entity2 alumnus @entity13 said about the decision , which he says felt like a " gut punch			0
" @entity16 , a chef and restaurateur who has met the chancellor , called @entity1 " a man of integrity " who " cares deeply about the university			1
" while the state board that voted not to renew his contract , which expires in september , cited " concerns centered on financial issues at the @entity29 , " the chancellor 's advocates feel something sinister is at play			1
@entity1 was magnanimous in his response , saying that while he was disappointed not to be granted another four - year term , he was proud of his accomplishments and every disagreement he had with the board was the product of both parties trying to do what 's best for the school			1
the financial issues at @entity29 , though , were only part of the problem , he wrote			0
" i was informed a key concern for the board was my relationship to board members and the commissioner and my unwillingness to adjust to the board 's desired governance structure , " he wrote			2
" over the last couple of years , i have expressed concern and disagreement with the board in some areas , including the funding allocation plan that distributes state funds to various public universities , business issues at the medical center , and responsibility for managing the selection process for the position of vice chancellor to lead the medical center			1
" @entity1 has been at the university 's helm since 2009 , when he took over for another popular leader , @entity71 , who retired			1
to hear @entity1 ' supporters tell it , he 's ushered in an era of unprecedented @entity75 , test scores , enrollment and fund - raising , including three straight years of nine - figure gifts to the school			1
but he also took stands that ruffled many at the 167 - year - old university			2
among those were measures aimed at dissociating the school from its @entity88 history -- the university athletics teams are the @entity90 -- including asking the band to stop playing the fight song " from @entity93			0
" under his tenure , the university also adopted a black bear as its mascot to replace @entity97 , a caricature of a plantation owner that had been removed as mascot in 2003			0
" he did amazing things for inclusion , " @entity13 said			0
" he tried to rid @entity2 of the good ol ' boy network			0
" unfortunately for his alma mater , @entity13 said , that good ol ' boy network " caught ( @entity1 ) in @entity106			1
" when the @entity109 -- fresh on the heels of @entity1 completing a reportedly successful round of chemotherapy for his lymphoma -- decided in a 9 - 2 decision not to renew his contract , the outcry was loud ( though the board and @entity1 concur the decision was unrelated to his health )			1
a protest wednesday brought more than 2,500 @entity1 supporters to the @entity123 , event co-organizer @entity119 said			1
it 's the university 's oldest building , which is located in the middle of campus and houses administrative offices			0
@entity119 , a sophomore @entity129 major , said the board 's decision has left him and his classmates " confused			0
" " chancellor @entity1 has always made himself available to students and always done what 's in our best interest , " @entity119 said			1
@entity71 and famous alumni -- such as former @entity142 quarterback ( and @entity143 and @entity145 's dad ) @entity138 and author @entity139 -- decried the move , as did numerous university groups , including the @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151			1
supporters also quickly assembled a @entity154 page , @entity156 feed , website and even a @entity159 page to cover the costs of protests , all pronouncing " i stand with @entity1 , " which has been adopted as a hashtag for the movement			2
@entity164 was the university 's first @entity166 - @entity165 president in 2000 - 2001			0
he took to @entity156 to express his discontent with @entity1 ' firing , calling him a " great leader who made tough decisions			2
" " in my opinion , they 've made an unforgivable decision , " said alumnus @entity172 , the former @entity173 ceo billed by @entity174 in @entity106 as the university 's most generous donor ( he 's reportedly given $ 30 million in the last decade and a half )			0
and that decision could cost the university at least $ 20 million from one donor alone , as the newspaper reports that @entity185 , president of the @entity186 , said he would not move forward with the grant for a new science building if @entity1 was n't reinstated			1
the @entity109 said in a news release that while it had no concerns regarding @entity1 ' integrity or honesty , the majority of members simply could not find " a path forward to renewal			2
" " dr. @entity1 has provided strong leadership in many facets of the @entity29 during his tenure			2
however , the @entity109 can not overlook its longstanding concerns regarding the business and financial affairs at @entity29 , " the saturday statement said			0
@entity119 said this explanation has n't given @entity206 students enough information to understand why @entity1 wo n't be reinstated			1
" they have to be hiding something , because they are n't giving us all the information , " he said			0
@entity3 reached out to @entity212 , @entity214 's commissioner , for comment			0
he has not yet replied			0
@entity1 has no intention of retiring or resigning before september , according to his statement .			2
