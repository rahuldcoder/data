@entity2 , @entity3 " @entity0 save @entity1 ! " a cry rings out in the bright spring air as the simple oak coffin of @entity1 is carried away from the tower block - filled campus of the @entity10 for the final time			1
the medieval monarch 's skeleton has been kept at the university since its discovery beneath a council car parking lot in the city sparked excitement around the world in august 2012			1
but on sunday the bones -- which have been studied by archaeologists and experts from all fields in the years since -- ended their tenure as scientific specimens and became , once more , the mortal remains of a king			1
some 35,000 people lined the streets of @entity2 and the surrounding towns and villages as the cortege wound its way through the countryside to the site of @entity1 's final battle , @entity37 , where he died in 1485 , before returning to the city for a commemoration at @entity40			1
the day began on the freshly - mown lawns in front of the university 's @entity43 , where a crowd gathered for a solemn service of farewell , dignitaries dressed in their sunday best alongside students and local families clad in jeans and waterproof jackets in case of a march shower			1
@entity10 student @entity55 , from @entity56 , said she and her classmates had come to watch the ceremony " so i can say i was here , " adding : " it 's an important historical event -- we do n't have things like this in the @entity64			0
" @entity2 alumni @entity65 and @entity67 brought their daughters @entity69 , 6 , and @entity70 , 9 , to watch the cortege pass by			0
" we thought it would be nice for the children to see it , " said @entity72			0
" it is amazing to be part of history , it makes me really proud of the university and of @entity2			0
" that pride is something which those who helped in the search for @entity1 share			2
@entity10 's president and vice-chancellor @entity86 said the discovery of the bones had been a " defining moment " which " reshaped history , " and pointed out that the university had been custodian of @entity1 's remains for longer than he ruled @entity3			1
genetics expert @entity94 , who proved the identity of the bones by matching their dna to a living relative of the monarch , @entity99 , said : " it has been an amazing project to be part of -- we all feel very privileged to be involved			1
" @entity94 , who read @entity104 's poem " @entity111 " at the university service and laid a white rose -- a reminder of @entity1 's heritage as a member of the @entity109 -- on the coffin , said she considered the commemorations the end of a chapter in his story , but not the end of the story itself ; she is still working to sequence his entire genome			1
@entity99 and another living relative of @entity1 , @entity124 , were there as the hearse carrying the coffin pulled away from the somber grey - brown bricks of the @entity43 ; accompanied by archaeologist @entity129 , who led the dig which uncovered the @entity94 's bones , they walked silently behind as the cortege 's journey began			1
thousands of people lined the route of the procession , out through the @entity138 villages visited by @entity1 on his way to the @entity37			1
perched on fold - up picnic chairs they gathered on roadside verges , along pavements decorated with bunting , flags and paper chains of white @entity109 roses , and in pub car parks to be entertained by folk dancers as they waited for the coffin to pass by			0
at @entity155 , thought to be the closest location to the spot where @entity1 died , earth from three key points in his life was placed in a casket carved with his symbol , a boar			2
the casket , and the procession , then made their way to @entity37 , where they were greeted by men dressed in medieval armor			2
here , @entity1 's role as a " warrior king " was commemorated and tributes were paid to the others who died fighting alongside him			1
a beacon , which will burn until he is laid to rest on thursday , was lit on the battlefield			2
back in @entity2 , thousands more gathered around the cathedral and in nearby @entity177			0
waiting to go in to the service , @entity179 , from the nearby town of @entity181 , said there was a " real buzz " around the city			0
" it 's quite exciting , coming over on the train i met people who 'd come from all over the world to be in @entity2 today			0
" @entity190 , who named her son @entity1 , said she had used the parking lot where the king 's remains were found			1
" four days before the dig started i parked my car over that grave ! " she said			0
adults -- some carrying single white roses and others wearing boar badges -- in village churches along the route watched the services play out on a big screen as children ran around in the late afternoon sunshine while they waited for @entity1 's return			2
in 1485 , the defeated king 's body was treated with little sense of occasion			0
it is said to have been slung naked over a horse and taken to @entity2 , where it was put on display for three days before being hurriedly crammed into a too - small plot in the @entity220			0
more than five centuries on , those who sparked the search for @entity1 's remains were determined to put right that ancient wrong by giving him a more fitting farewell			1
@entity226 , who led the " @entity228 " project , said its aim was " to give @entity1 what he did n't get in 1485 ... to recognize what went on in the past , but not repeat it , to make peace with the past			0
" to that end , the king 's skeleton is to be given two things it did not have before : a coffin and proper burial rites			2
the coffin is a simple affair : @entity3 oak and yew , made by @entity1 's relative @entity99 who , as chance would have it , is a cabinet maker by trade ; it is carved with the king 's name and a white rose			1
the burial rites are somewhat more complicated : they have entailed the rebuilding of parts of @entity2 's cathedral , a guest list numbering into the thousands and delicate questions of location and religion			0
but with those puzzles overcome , the first of several high profile pre-reinterment services was held sunday evening : the coffin was carried through the city on a gun carriage , accompanied by two " knights " in full suits of armor , riding on horseback , to the cathedral			1
those who had gathered to pay tribute to @entity1 threw roses into the procession 's path as it passed the new visitor center which has been built over his original resting place			2
as the city 's church bells tolled and dusk began to fall , the coffin was lifted onto the shoulders of the pallbearers and taken into the cathedral , accompanied by four official " mourners " -- descendants of some of those who fought with @entity1 at @entity37			1
once inside , it was covered with a heavily - embroidered cloth , and a @entity293 and specially - commissioned crown were laid atop the casket , the latter by a local @entity297 , 9 - year - old @entity298 , whose height meant a step had to be placed next to the coffin to allow her to reach it			0
in his sermon , the archbishop of @entity305 , cardinal @entity303 alluded to @entity1 's controversial reputation and " tumultuous life , " which had seen moments of " astonishing brutality			2
" @entity311 said the king 's short reign was " marked by unrest and the fatal seepage of loyalty and support " but insisted that he was also " a man of prayer , a man of anxious devotion " and one who had done good for his people			0
as those who had attended filed back out into the darkening spring evening , one final illuminated tribute was paid : the initials @entity326 and a crown were projected onto the cathedral 's tower , while nearby , white roses surrounded a statue of the king			1
as she left the service , @entity335 , who won a ticket to the event , said the experience had been " brilliant " and the memorial " absolutely lovely			0
" " it 's a lovely way to spend a sunday evening -- not like being at home doing the ironing , " she told @entity4			0
" it 's part of history : i can say ' i 've been to a king 's funeral			0

@entity1 will finally be laid to rest in @entity40 this week
on sunday his remains were taken from the city 's university to the site of his final battle , @entity37
the bones , in a coffin made by a living relative of the king , are now lying ' in repose ' at the cathedral
