the rev. @entity0 , the pulpit giant who was " like no other preacher you have ever heard , " has died , his church announced			1
@entity0 , who redefined the art of preaching , died friday in @entity9 , @entity10			1
the cause has not been disclosed			2
the 86 - year - old had been in declining health due to @entity14 in recent years , according to the @entity16 reporter			2
" @entity0 was a national treasure and a devoted servant of the church and @entity20			1
his impact on preaching -- in terms both of scholarship and practice -- is incalculable , " said the rev. @entity21 , a friend and a pastor at @entity24 's @entity23			1
@entity0 faces his toughest convert preachers studied classic @entity32 sermons such as " @entity33 ? " and " @entity34 and @entity35 , " much like aspiring jazz musicians listened to saxophonist @entity37 and amateur boxers studied tapes of @entity40 -- for clues to greatness and inspiration			1
@entity0 elevated preaching to an art. he was often called a preaching genius			1
rather than deliver a sermon like a lecture -- an intro , three main points and a conclusion -- he developed an " inductive " conversational style of preaching			2
his sermons unfolded like a short story -- there was foreshadowing , plot twists , dialogue ; language of startling beauty and surprise endings			2
the way he ended his sermons was as memorable as what he said			2
he would abruptly stop , turn from the pulpit , and quietly sit as the audience sat in silence			2
people did n't applaud or shout hallelujah after his sermons			0
they were too busy absorbing what he had just said			0
the rev. @entity70 , an author and world - renowned preacher , once said of @entity0 : " he spoke of @entity74 as easily as he spoke of the @entity75			1
he quoted @entity76 as helpfully as @entity77 ... but he was also someone who noticed a lot about ordinary human life on earth			0
" @entity0 , who taught preaching at the @entity23 until his retirement , was selected as one of the 12 most effective preachers in the @entity85 - speaking world in a poll of 341 seminary professors and editors of religious periodicals in 1996			1
i had a chance to meet @entity0 , as well as hear him			1
i spent several weeks with him in the autumn of 2011 to write a profile about his relationship with his father			0
he was just as impressive outside the pulpit			0
he would ease his rotund little body in a wooden chair and share touching stories about growing up poor in the small town of @entity101 , @entity102 , during the @entity103 with an alcoholic father			0
he 'd talk about the infirmities of old age -- i remember saying with a chuckle that " i should have something " when referring to his bout with @entity14 's because he was getting old			2
he was funny , folksy , witty and his eyes danced with glee when he told a story			0
sitting in @entity0 's presence was like listening to a wise uncle or grandmother			1
he had courtly , @entity117 manners , and he gave the impression that he had all the time in the world for you			2
i never once heard him criticize anyone			0
it 's not uncommon to meet great people who , to borrow a phrase that @entity0 used , have " domestic wreckage " at home			1
but the @entity0 family was among his biggest fans			1
he was married to his high school sweetheart , @entity129 , for more than 50 years , and they had two children , @entity132 and @entity37			0
@entity132 named her son after her father			0
and @entity37 , who became a ceo instead of a pastor , said his father was the most remarkable man he knew			0
" i do n't care if it 's a guy on the street asking for a dollar or the president of the @entity143 , he makes you feel as if you 're the most important person in the world when he 's talking to you , " said @entity138			1
" i won the lottery as far as great fathers go			0
" over the years , i kept in contact with him			0
i 'd go to preaching workshops at his beloved @entity151 , a non-profit ministry that served needy children in @entity10 , @entity102 and @entity154			1
the center provides books , hot meals , storytelling and music			0
perhaps @entity0 saw something of himself in the kids he helped			1
one thing is certain : he was n't content to preach compassion			0
@entity0 's funeral will be held at 2 p.m. monday at @entity166 in @entity9 , @entity10			1
people we 've lost in 2015			0
