@entity0 2 has landed safely in @entity2 on the first leg of its quest to be the first plane to fly around the world fueled only by the sun 's rays			1
the solar - powered plane took off from @entity10 in the @entity11 early on monday with pilot @entity12 at the controls for the 400 - kilometer ( 250 mile ) flight			1
the journey was expected to take about 12 hours , but high winds of up to 11 knots delayed its landing , forcing @entity12 to fly in a holding pattern above @entity20 until they dropped to safe levels			1
once safely on the ground , @entity12 said he was " extremely happy " and " looking forward to the rest of [ the ] adventure			0
" @entity0 2 's visit to @entity2 is a short pit - stop on its marathon 35,000 - kilometer , five month journey across the globe , via @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and the @entity34 the plane is expected to be on the ground for just eight hours before it takes off again -- this time with pilot @entity39 in charge -- bound for @entity41 in @entity31			1
the potentially historic flight had originally been due to take off on march 1 but its departure was postponed because of concerns about the weather after strong dust storms created hazy conditions			0
" we have had a lot of sandstorms in @entity10 , and also a lot of wind , sea breezes , higher than the limit , " said the team 's meteorologist @entity48 in an interview posted on @entity51 and @entity52			0
by monday morning , the skies had cleared sufficiently for takeoff , though there was a slight delay while technical checks were carried out , as pilot @entity12 explained on @entity51			1
eventually the plane got off the ground , under the watchful eye of fellow pilot @entity39			2
monday 's journey to @entity2 was a relatively short one , compared to some of the longer legs , which will take up to five or six days and nights			0
@entity12 and @entity39 will spend a total of 500 hours behind the controls over the entire trip , taking it in turns in the tiny 3.8 - square meter single - seater cockpit			1
before the takeoff , @entity39 admitted the pair " had " butterflies in the stomach " at the thought of getting underway after working on the project for so long			0
on sunday , the pair joked about tossing a coin for the right to fly first , before tearfully revealing that they had already decided who would be doing what			0
" @entity12 has worked on this airplane ... for 12 years , from the feasibility study until now ; it is more than natural that he takes the first step , " said @entity39			2
@entity12 added : " @entity39 deserves to fly the last leg , and to make the arrival in @entity10 , completing the vision he created 15 years ago			1
" the pair will also split ocean - flying duties : @entity39 will take on the five - day , five - night journey across the @entity100 , while @entity12 will tackle the @entity101			1
@entity0 's 72 - meter ( 236 - foot ) wingspan makes it wider than a @entity104 , but the plane weighs just 2.5 tons , lighter than a large suv			0
the tiny cockpit will be packed with essentials for the journey -- enough food and water for a week -- as well as a parachute , life raft and oxygen bottles in case of emergencies			0
@entity12 and @entity39 , who piloted an earlier version of the plane across the @entity34 in 2013 , are no strangers to adventure			2
@entity12 is a former fighter pilot , and @entity39 was part of the first team to circumnavigate the earth nonstop in a balloon in 1999 .			2

@entity0 completes first leg of its round - the - world flight , from @entity10 to @entity2
pilot @entity12 was at the controls ; @entity39 will tackle the second journey
after pit stop in @entity20 , @entity2 , the solar - powered plane will travel on to @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33
