there were three @entity2 in march 1965 , and @entity3 had missed the first one			1
@entity3 , whose act of civil disobedience sparked the @entity8 bus boycott in 1955 , moved to @entity9 two years later for safety reasons			0
death threats , in @entity11 , were too much for her to endure			0
for eight years , @entity3 , a working - class woman , toiled at the @entity13 in @entity14 , making dishrags , for low wages			0
but on march 1 , 1965 , she abruptly quit to join @entity19 rep. @entity18 ' staff in @entity9			1
the voting rights movement in the @entity21 , led by the rev. @entity22 , coupled with the assassination of @entity24 that february , had re-energized her appetite for direct political action			1
on sunday , march 7 , @entity3 was at home in @entity9 watching the @entity30 television premiere of " @entity31 " when the broadcast was suddenly interrupted by a news flash from @entity2 , @entity11			1
a peaceful throng of voting rights activists had marched onto the steel - arched @entity36 that spanned the @entity37 , only to be brutally assaulted by police and @entity11 state troopers , most of them wearing gas masks			1
before being arrested and beaten these protesters had been headed to the state capital in @entity8 , a distance of 54 miles , to demand federal protection of blacks ' right to vote			0
that sunday afternoon , 25 - year - old @entity48 , then chairman of @entity49 and today a @entity19 congressman from @entity52 's 5th district , had been tear - gassed and billy clubbed as he tried to cross the bridge			1
the sight of him being beaten sickened @entity3			0
@entity48 had emerged as the bravest and youngest of the major civil rights leaders of the @entity57 era , even speaking at the @entity58 in 1963			1
as a @entity59 in the @entity21 , he was arrested 24 times , and proud of it			0
therefore on march 9 , to protest " @entity2 , " as the incident became known , @entity3 walked down @entity9 's wide @entity63 in full solidarity with @entity65 and the others arrested in @entity2			1
" the @entity36 for me was wrought in symbolism , " @entity3 recalled years later			0
" the photos taken that day made me think of the bridge as a battlefield , like at @entity71			1
it was the start of a turning point			0
" so when @entity22 -- who had been in @entity74 for " @entity2 " -- telegrammed @entity3 about returning to @entity11 to take part in a third mass march from @entity2 to @entity8 , her immediate answer was " why , of course			2
" once back in @entity8 in late march at @entity22 's request , @entity3 looked around to see what had changed since the ' 50s			1
" one of the first things i did was look at the buses , " she told me in 1997			0
" and yes -- they were integrated			0
" on march 25 , parks , the " @entity89 , " spoke eloquently in @entity8 though her soft voice was barely audible over the crackling speakers			2
per usual , @entity22 stole the show that day with a rousing piece of oratory			0
" we are on the move , " the @entity99 - winning preacher shouted , " and no wave of racism will stop us ! " that evening @entity22 flew back to @entity74 in high spirits , deeming the third @entity2 - to - @entity8 march an unqualified success			2
yet @entity3 , near broke , took a bus back to @entity74 the next day , deeply depressed			0
there was too much white hatred still in @entity8 to feel victorious			0
her great fear was that @entity2 was only a stride forward , in basketball parlance , not a slam - dunk			0
@entity19 was still poisoned by the curse of institutional racism			0
the fight for voting rights was just beginning			1
true ballot - box equality was still a long way off			0
even after president @entity117 signed the @entity118 of 1965 that summer , @entity3 remained somewhat skeptical			2
she knew @entity21 white bigots would concoct evil new ways to disenfranchise black people			0
as @entity19 reflects on the significance of the 50th anniversary of @entity2 this weekend , it 's important to honor the martyrs of " @entity2 " in a lasting way			1
certainly , the fact that @entity128 , an @entity129 , is @entity19 president proves that @entity48 did n't get his head dented in vain			1
but the recent egregious findings of the @entity133 following the @entity135 case as well as other incidents resulting in the deaths of unarmed men of color still give us reason to pause			0
" i remember feeling something was not right , " @entity3 recalled shortly after the third @entity2 march			2
" even though the march was over , i felt that everything was not right			2
" one thing " not right " on the 50th anniversary of the @entity2 marches is the sad fact that the @entity36 has n't been renamed the @entity148			1
continuing to honor @entity149 -- a @entity150 general , @entity19 senator and white supremacist -- is insulting to @entity19 's civil rights heroes			1
when the bridge was built in 1940 , @entity153 ruled @entity11			2
@entity156 blacks had no say in the bridge being named to honor a reconstruction - era white supremacist			1
thankfully a group of conscientious students has recently started a petition drive to rid the iconic bridge of @entity149 ' name			2
but let 's go further than just removing @entity149 ' name ; let 's rename the bridge for someone who deserves our admiration			1
i 'm not a historian who thinks @entity150 memorials should be boarded up			0
places such as @entity176 ' @entity175 estate along the @entity177 and the pedestaled statue of @entity179 in @entity180 ( turning his back to the @entity182 ) need historic preservation			0
but the @entity36 -- which in 2013 was declared a @entity184 -- is n't symbolic of the @entity185 in a meaningful way			0
it is , however , the modern - day battlefield where the voting rights movement was born			1
there is no more fitting tribute to the death of @entity153 than to rename the " @entity2 " bridge after @entity48			1
i urge president @entity128 , the @entity195 , the state of @entity11 and the city of @entity2 to " do the right thing			1
" like the @entity199 , the @entity148 would become a sacred place for visitors to reflect on noble @entity19 traditions -- in this case , peaceful protest and voting rights			1
the " we shall overcome " year of 1965 would , at last , be given its historical due in @entity2			0
" i 'm with the kids , " the rev. @entity208 , a close associate of @entity22 's , recently said in supporting the @entity36 being redesignated			2
" let 's change it			2
