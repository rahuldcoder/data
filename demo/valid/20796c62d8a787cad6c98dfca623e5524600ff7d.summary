@entity1 unexpected car repairs can blow anyone 's budget			1
but when you 're struggling to make ends meet , the impact can extend well beyond your bank account			1
as a social worker in @entity1 , @entity9 repeatedly saw how car problems could create a domino effect that endangered her clients ' health , their jobs , even their homes			1
for years , she wished someone would do something about the problem			2
then one day @entity9 realized , " oh dang , i think that somebody might be me			2
" in 2008 , she quit her full - time job and enrolled in automotive school			2
five years later , armed with a degree in auto technology , @entity9 founded the lift			1
her nonprofit garage provides steeply discounted car repairs to low - income individuals			1
the approach is simple : @entity9 sells parts at cost , with no markup , and charges $ 15 an hour for labor ; the going rate in @entity1 is around $ 100 an hour			2
the result ? big savings for her customers			2
and for those who ca n't pay in full , she will work out payment plans			2
to date , @entity9 has provided affordable car repairs to more than 300 low - income individuals , saving them more than $ 170,000 and keeping them on the road to success			1
do you know a hero ? nominations are open for @entity48 2015 i talked with @entity9 about her career change and what she 's learned from her work			1
below is an edited version of our conversation			2
@entity57 : one day you 're a social worker , the next you 're in automotive school			2
what was that like ? @entity9 : imagine a scene of a 38 - year - old woman and 18 - year - old boys			2
i want to talk about feelings and people , and they want to talk about cars			1
it was a huge culture shift and a huge knowledge shift			2
i had to use my brain very differently			2
i did not grow up working on cars			2
i did not have a father that wrenched on cars			0
it was not part of my life growing up			0
i taught myself a few things ( like ) changing oil			0
but for the most part , i had no skills around car maintenance			1
i cried all the way to school the first day ' cause i was like , " what have i done ? " so it was terrifying and overwhelming			0
and at least three solid times in that first quarter , i was like , " i 'm quitting			0
i can not do this			0
" see more @entity48 i give credit , at least in that first quarter , to one of my instructors who 's now on the board of the lift , who kept saying , " i know that you have a good vision here , and i 'm going to help you get through this			1
" and when i really thought about it , going to school is nothing compared to people who are trying to raise their kids on minimum wage , who are living with a broken - down car in subzero weather			1
basically , i needed to buck up			0
@entity57 : what 's it like being a mechanic ? @entity9 : it 's physically hard			1
you find yourself in all sorts of crazy positions , digging under things			0
you 're wrenching on things			0
but it is mentally challenging , and it can be really frustrating			0
because you have all the pieces and for some reason , something is not working , and it 's like , " what is it ? " and to really think thoroughly and understand full systems and how those systems play together , it is , i think , way more difficult than i think the average person thinks it is			0
i think of being a mechanic a lot like being a doctor			1
people come in , they give you a list of symptoms			1
you try to ask a lot of questions to narrow it down until we get an accurate diagnosis			0
and sometimes we get it wrong , but most of the time we get it right			0
but it is an art and a science mixed into one			0
it 's a very satisfying job , when you can have a car come in not starting and you send it out the door running			1
at the end of the day , you can feel really good because you can look back and be like , " this is what i did today			0
" @entity57 : you 're also helping some of the mechanics on your staff			0
how so ? @entity9 : different members of our staff have struggled with poverty and crisis in their own lives			0
some of them have had interactions with the criminal justice system			0
two of the three techs that we have i met when they were both experiencing homelessness			0
and they are all trained , formal , certified technicians			0
and so that is another piece of the work that we do at the lift			1
we take a chance on folks who other places might not be willing to take a chance on			0
@entity57 : you save your clients a lot of money			0
how do they react ? @entity9 : for the most part , people are ecstatic when they get the bill			1
and that just makes such a huge difference in people 's lives			1
we had a customer in here a few weeks ago who is sleeping in his car			1
and he had just gotten released from the hospital because he had frostbite because he did n't have heat in his car			1
and so it 's not just about getting people to and from work or to and from school , even though that 's a really important piece of it			1
it 's really about protecting people 's lives			1
for many people , having a car that works and that is safe holds the rest of the pieces together			1
and it really allows them to remain independent , to remain self - sufficient , to meet the basic needs of their lives and do it with dignity			0
