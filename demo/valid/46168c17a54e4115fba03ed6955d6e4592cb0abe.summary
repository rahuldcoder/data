in the two years since " @entity0 " became a best - seller and sparked countless conversations about gender equality , author @entity5 says she has gotten one question over and over from men : what can they do ? now the @entity11 chief operating officer is giving them some specific answers by aligning with one of the most popular athletes on the planet			1
if @entity17 is encouraging men to lean in for women , do n't you think some of his 19 million @entity21 followers will get the message too ? that 's certainly what @entity5 and her @entity25 colleagues are hoping , following their brand new partnership with the @entity28 and the @entity29 and the creation of a public service campaign called @entity32			1
in a 30 - second video of @entity28 and @entity29 all - stars , we see @entity17 of the @entity36 holding up a poster , which says " @entity38			1
" @entity39 of the @entity40 says , " when men lean in , everyone wins , " and then touts how he leans in for his wife , mother and grandmother			1
" help women aim high , " says @entity46 of the @entity47			2
the significance of the message and the men who are relaying it is twofold , says @entity5			1
to truly bring about equality at home and at work , men need to be part of the discussion , and we need to bring the discussion to where men are , she says			2
@entity5 at @entity64 : not every woman has to be a ceo " the conversation about equality has long existed by women , for women , in women 's forums where women are , and that will continue , and that 's important			1
but bringing it to the center of the court , bringing men to the center of that conversation -- people like @entity17 and @entity77 ( of the @entity78 ) and @entity39 , saying ' i 'm in for equality and here 's why ' -- i think that could be transformative , " said @entity5 in a phone interview			1
what @entity5 and @entity25 are also hoping to do is show men specifically what they can do , providing a series of tips about things they could start doing at home and at work , and as managers , as soon as they finish reading this story			1
many of the suggestions might seem like common sense to many women -- such as male managers giving women credit in meetings and men sharing 50 - 50 in household and child care duties at home			1
but @entity5 says with the list of " simple , clear , everyday things , practical things " men can do that are based on real data , men will see not only how they can help but how they individually will benefit			1
for instance , research shows that boys and girls with a more involved father are healthier , mentally and physically , happier , have stronger emotional attachments and relationships , are at lower risk for substance abuse and are more successful at work and at home , @entity5 said			1
for girls , there 's an extra benefit , she said			1
by age 14 , if a girl sees her father doing child care and housework , her concept of the array of things she can do professionally is much broader than that of girls who do n't see their fathers doing household chores , she said , pointing to a study by the @entity145 and published in a journal of the @entity147			1
" the way men react when you tell them children of more active fathers of any income level , no matter how active a mother is , do better -- a lot of men , particularly those with wives who are home ( and who say ) ' i 'm covered			1
my kids are in good hands ' ... they are motivated , " said @entity5			2
despite ' @entity0 , ' workplace equality remains abysmal dads might think they are doing all they can by telling their daughters they can be anything they want , but if @entity168 is still doing all the cooking and cleaning , their girls are n't getting the full message			2
" what really matters is seeing what you do			0
you have to walk the walk			0
she needs to see equality to believe it			0
" another huge goal , @entity5 says , is showing men they wo n't lose out in the workplace when there is more equality in the executive suites and in boardrooms			1
" if you 've long been in the majority and long held power , and you see change , you could naturally be nervous that this was n't going to help you , " said @entity5			2
men need to realize it 's not a zero sum game , she said			2
" when companies do better , there are more jobs , more promotions , more salaries for everyone			0
when companies do worse , there 's less for everyone , " she said			0
she mentioned a recent study by the @entity202 , which found that if women were in the workforce at the same percentage as men in the @entity210 , our country 's gross domestic product would grow by 5 %			1
" we have n't seen 5 % gdp growth in a long time			0
... that 's a lot of jobs for a lot of people , so understanding that this is beneficial for everyone , i think , is huge			0
" work - life balance not just a women 's issue @entity5 's # @entity223 comes as emphasis seems to be growing on getting boys and men to think about gender equality			1
@entity5 will be one of the opening night speakers at a four - day conference on engaging men and boys that begins thursday in @entity232			1
the conference is sponsored by @entity234 at @entity235			0
in january , a @entity237 conference sponsored by @entity238 and @entity239 , which i was honored to attend as a panel participant , brought together ambassadors , other policymakers , and athletes and artists , with the goal of changing the discourse among men on gender equality			0
an overriding message repeated at the conference was that we ca n't keep telling men what to do			0
we need to show them what many men are already doing every day at home and at work			2
" @entity38 ' gets a makeover in @entity262 ads that is why the recent focus on caring dads in ads during this year 's @entity262 was so applauded by men like sociologist @entity267 , who is spearheading this week 's @entity232 conference on men and masculinities			2
" this provides a counternarrative to all the action hero , buffoon images that we see , " @entity267 told me when i talked to him days before the @entity262			0
@entity267 said very few men , fewer than 10 % , can relate to the way the media depict masculinity , according to a study conducted by @entity282			0
@entity267 was hired by the brand as an adviser to help analyze its research			0
men today are spending far more time doing housework and helping with child care and are enjoying more egalitarian relationships than any generation in @entity210 history , and their ideas about what it means to be a man have begun to shift as well , said @entity267 , who is the author of more than 20 books including " manhood in @entity210 : a cultural history			0
" @entity5 says we need to recognize and support the new definitions of masculinity and hopes the message from stars like @entity17 and @entity39 goes a long way toward doing that			1
" i am increasingly convinced that unless we fully accept men as caregivers , we ca n't fully accept women as leaders , " she said			2
" we 've got to stop calling it ' mommy and me			0
' as long as we are calling it ' @entity168 and me , ' we are communicating to women that this is their job ... and we have to do both sides of this			0
" admittedly impatient about gender equality ( i 'm impatient too ! ) , @entity5 concedes we have a long way to go until the gender equality problem is solved and @entity25 can close its doors			2
" we have been fighting for equality for too long , " she said , noting that women starting earning about 50 % of college degrees back in 1981			0
" thirty - four years is plenty of time to get 50 % of the top jobs , and we 're not close			0
we 're at 5 ( % ) in the @entity329			0
and so we have to change , we have to change more			0
we have to get more people involved			0
do you think @entity28 stars like @entity333 and @entity39 can help encourage men to ' lean in ' ? share your thoughts with @entity336 ( @ kellywallacetv ) on @entity21 or @entity337 on @entity11 .			1
