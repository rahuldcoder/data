even from afar , @entity197 had strong words for the @entity13 : " you violated the sovereignty ( of @entity3 ) , " he said , " and you bear the responsibility for what happened and what is going to happen			2
" that @entity204 summit produced a notable agreement : the @entity212 , which paves the way for a united @entity204 force that would be ready to fight insurgents if a member country came under attack			0

" many @entity234 representatives have had to flee the chaos			0
and @entity1 naval special forces have rescued dozens of diplomats , a @entity1 official said			1
the conflict in @entity3 also led to the withdrawal of @entity163 special forces earlier this month , seriously undermining counterterrorism efforts in a country that has been a stronghold for @entity40			0
@entity28 , of the @entity29 , said what 's happening in @entity3 could devolve into a long , protracted religious war			1
