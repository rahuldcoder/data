@entity2 @entity0 , @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 -- just a few of the aid workers who have been abducted and killed by @entity7 in the past year			1
the exact number of aid workers currently being held is unknown ; a level of secrecy tends to surround details of those currently captive			1
what we do know is @entity7 holds at least one female aid worker , and possibly more			1
the @entity17 of the @entity18 confirmed three aid workers who disappeared in october 2013 remain missing , but would not comment on their identities or who kidnapped them			1
abductions and killings of aid workers are , unfortunately , nothing new , but the numbers are			1
according to @entity28 , at least 155 aid workers were killed in 2013 , a 121 % increase on 70 recorded killings the year before			1
not all were victims of @entity7 , a relatively new phenomenon given life by the chaos in embattled @entity35			1
in fact , according to the same report , it is the @entity39 who have historically kidnapped in the greatest numbers , in large part in @entity43			1
here 's the difference : @entity7 is changing the game			1
the @entity39 may have many reasons for abductions ( flexing their muscles , negotiating prisoner releases ) , but they also have a record of frequent hostage release			2
the need for aid in a specific region and the level of the acceptance by the community matters , or mattered			1
for @entity7 , it appears to matter less			2
abducted aid workers are usually either a source of considerable income ( @entity7 demanded at least $ 6 million for @entity0 , and reportedly $ 200 million for two @entity63 hostages ) or , failing that , their killings provide a lurid display of brutality for the world to witness			1
so far the number of hostages of all backgrounds freed by @entity7 is extremely low , save for those whose ransoms were paid			2
the freeing of 19 kidnapped @entity73 shocked many , because release is not a common part of @entity7 ' playbook			2
these tactics can serve as models to other extremist groups worldwide , who may look to emulate @entity7 ' model of abduction and violence			2
one example is @entity86 extremist group @entity85 , which released a video purportedly showing the beheading of two men claimed to be spies , an approach disturbingly similar to @entity7 '			2
" humanitarian work has always been risky , but it 's never been more dangerous than it is now , " says @entity92 , president and ceo of the @entity94			2
" there used to be a time when an organization 's flag provided a great deal of protection			2
that 's no longer the case			2
" the response in large part from aid agencies has not been to pull out of @entity35 and its environs altogether , but to rely almost exclusively on local staffers			1
still , outside workers like @entity0 , @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 were inside @entity35 when they were taken , and the regional directors of aid agencies continue to travel there frequently in order to oversee operations			1
not only that , but simply by virtue of working for a large aid agency , local staffers become bait			1
indeed , the majority of victims have been working in their own countries			2
@entity7 does n't just target aid workers			1
journalists , soldiers and anyone who conceivably could fetch a ransom are high on their hit list			2
but in the @entity128 that is @entity35 and its borders , few of these remain , save for aid workers			1
in a space devoid of government , refugee camps and aid agencies are frequently seen as the only authorities , the new front line in the war on terror , a sometimes unwelcome association			1
and as @entity7 spreads beyond @entity35 's borders , the risks grow further afield			1
yet despite these risks , thousands of aid workers continue to work in a region where the @entity146 high commissioner for refugees ( @entity146 ) estimates the number of refugees from conflict at more than 8 million			1
while some aid agencies rely on security personnel for protection , many are completely unarmed and are particularly vulnerable when in transit			1
their security and locations for the most part are under constant review			2
when @entity1 approached a number of reputable aid agencies asking to speak to those who work or travel in the region about their experiences , and what drives them to remain despite an unprecedented threat level , many declined , in large part due to security concerns			1
for this reason , some of those mentioned below are wholly or partially anonymous			0
if i think back , i 've been doing this work for about 20 years , and i remember we used to have this sense that there was some sort of protection , some sort of ... humanitarian space ... it feels very much like that is shrinking ... our job is becoming much , much more difficult ; we 're asking people to put themselves in harm 's way in some circumstances			0
i mean , we do n't do that , but it 's not the exception any more			0
my family is not thrilled at all because what they see on the news is @entity195 being kidnapped and beheaded ... when they worry , i worry about them and that does n't help me be in a good state of mind to do my work			0
i 'm very selective about where i say i go			0
i need to find ways to switch off and do silly things and not worry about the dire situation that 's here , not just the humanitarian situation but ... being responsible for the people i 'm responsible for in this region			0
i do n't think people see the human side so much ... innocent people who through no fault of their own have been forced to flee their home one , two , three times -- who do n't see a future for their children ... someone has to be there to help and support and provide some sense of safety and security , and i mean that in the personal sense of a mother who , when she goes to sleep at night with her children , she knows she has a blanket to keep them warm and something to feed them the next day			0
fear is always there in the back of everyone 's mind			0
we just need to continue what we 're doing , stopping is not an option , halting our operations is not an option , and we are taking great risks , our staff are taking great risks			0
it is a difficult thing to tell family , to tell colleagues			0
oftentimes i just do n't mention all the details of where i go because they just do n't need to know			0
but it needs to be done , we also ca n't run an operation remotely			0
... i 'm not going to the front lines , i 'm not going to where the conflict is actually hot ... we 're not adrenaline driven people			0
we want to be able to help the people and do our work and to do our work does entail taking some risks , but it 's about calculated risks			0
we do n't want to put ourselves directly in front of danger			0
if we say we give up on it for whatever reason -- security , morale , pressure from here , pressure from there -- no one else is going to come to take our place			0
there 's not going to be another organization that 's going to come and do more humanitarian aid and cover the gap that @entity276 may create , that 's not going to happen			1
so that puts more responsibility on the shoulders of our staff and the shoulders of our organization ; we feel that responsibility that we 've got to deliver on this thing			0
donate to @entity276 there 's an internal motivation that keeps you going			0
you feel that there are populations and people that need aid and require assistance , and know it 's a choice that one makes and dedicate your life service			1
so yes , you need be of course strong , motivated , passionate , and of course feel the need to assist and deliver			0
it 's an unprecedented time , and what we 're calling the new normal ... as we 've seen in the last year , the complete radicalization of these spaces with extremist groups , who have a very hard view in terms of cooperation with neutral and humanitarian organizations such as ours ... we 're not the @entity307 , we do n't have a physical ability to repel			0
there may be in people 's perceived minds there was a golden age of humanitarian acceptance : like if you were a charity and waved a white flag and drove a white car , you 'd be protected by bad guys and loved by the community			0
i think that golden age is more myth than reality , but regarding today 's reality it 's extremely dangerous it 's so true			0
and your flag , your neutrality , your white car , all the good intention you have , that recipe is very difficult in these complicated emergencies			0
there 's a phrase that the @entity146 uses and a lot of @entity335 use which is " stay and deliver , " so we have a humanitarian imperative to be there , but we always have to be in a risk management role ; we have to critically look at : do the risks outweigh the benefits we hope to get ? the fear factor comes in just managing the emotional toll it takes with your family and friends , and that has more of a toll , i think , with individual staff members than actual external environment ... frankly , sometimes i do n't tell them till i 'm already on my way so i do n't have to have those calls before i even get on an airplane			0
it 's hard ; there are some areas where the family and friends do n't understand why you 're going there , and you re-articulate , " if not you , then who ? " and you ask , " would you want this in your neighborhood next door where no one comes to help you if something bad happened ? " donate to @entity364 for ways to donate to organizations working to help refugees from @entity7 and from the conflict in that region , go to @entity1 / impact			1

numerous aid workers remain in @entity35 despite dangers
with a lack of government , more than 8 million refugees rely on aid agencies for food , shelter and medical care
many aid agencies have no means of armed *defense* against attack
