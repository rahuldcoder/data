@entity2 in his teenage years , there was little to set @entity4 -- a quiet , hardworking boy with a few friends -- apart from his classmates			1
that 's according to @entity8 , his former head teacher at @entity10 in northwest @entity2			1
now 26 , @entity11 has gained international notoriety after being identified as the @entity14 militant nicknamed " @entity15 " who 's appeared in beheading videos of @entity19 hostages			1
but in his school days , it was a different matter			1
when he joined @entity24 at 14 or 15 , he was little trouble himself but was the focus of some bullying			0
" he was bullied a little , but because he was quiet and he was reserved ... generally he was fine , " @entity8 said			1
" there were no massive behavior problems with him , and by the time he got into ... ( his last years ) he had settled , he was working hard , he achieved great grades for him , and he went to the university of his choice			2
" he just did n't stand out as troubled , she said			0
" if there had been any concerns about @entity4 , they would have been picked up , and we would have intervened and tried to support him in any way that we could have done			1
" born in @entity41 , but brought up in @entity2 from the age of 6 , @entity4 was one of the school 's many students from an immigrant background			1
the school 's intake is 70 % @entity48 , said @entity8 , with many students coming from large housing estates in what is a multicultural area of @entity2			1
but its ethos was one of tolerance and integration , with all students encouraged to feel part of the school community			2
staff made great efforts to get to know the 1,400 students in the school so that nobody would feel excluded or left behind , @entity8 said			2
they also reached out to the sometimes insular , conservative @entity48 communities that many of their students came from , she said , to try to help students who could feel torn between different cultures			0
nonetheless , @entity4 was somehow drawn in by radical influences , most likely outside of school or through social media			1
and he was not alone			0
at least two other students who attended @entity24 also allegedly later turned to @entity77 extremism			0
one , @entity78 , only overlapped at the school by a few months with @entity8			2
he was reportedly killed in a @entity81 drone strike in @entity82 in 2012			0
" he was very outgoing , jolly , sporty kind of person and fun , " @entity8 said			0
@entity8 sees social media as the greatest danger facing young people and their families today			0
" i think social media is terrifying because it does have the power to influence young people in a way that as adults we have no power to control , " she said			0
she still finds it hard to believe that @entity4 could be the apparent killer with the @entity2 accent recorded on @entity14 videos			1
" my blood just ran cold , " she said of when she first heard the news			0
" when i hear the name , i just find it incredible to marry what i 've clearly seen on the tv with the person that i knew			0
it literally makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up			0
i ca n't believe what has happened to him and the influences that clearly have completely changed him			0
" i think it 's horrific , the idea that a young man like that could become somebody that people say is the poster boy for ( @entity14 )			1
i just think it 's shocking			2
" the @entity2 - accented voice is all too familiar to anyone who 's watched the videos released by @entity14 of the killing of @entity19 hostages			2
@entity129 , a @entity2 - based advocacy group that worked with @entity4 , has released audio of a phone conversation from 2009 in which he talks about members of the @entity136 security services questioning him			1
they asked about his attitude toward the july 7 , 2005 , terror attacks in @entity2 and the 9/11 attacks on the @entity81 , he says			0
" we 're going to keep a close eye on you , @entity4 , " he alleges they told him			1
@entity129 has painted a picture of a young man driven to extremism by unwarranted harassment by security services			1
it says emails he sent the group paint a picture of a desperate man hounded by authorities who saw his plans for a new life crumble as he tried unsuccessfully to get help			2
but some analysts say the emails are only part of the story , arguing that investigators targeted @entity167 because they already saw he had links with terrorist groups .			0

@entity4 's *ex-head* teacher says he was a quiet boy , *slightly* bullied at school
she says there was no sign during his school years that he was turning to radical @entity179
