it turns out that @entity2 may be more than just an enormous ball of gas spinning a few hundred million miles farther out in the solar system			1
we earthlings might have the giant planet to thank for our very existence			2
two scientists are suggesting that the inner solar system once played host to a bunch of " super-earths " -- planets that were larger than our own but smaller than @entity17			1
@entity2 , however , put an end to those early occupiers of the inner orbits , bulldozing in and sweeping them into the sun , according to a paper published this week in the @entity24			2
@entity2 's epic , planet - shattering journey toward the sun and back out again laid the foundations for the creation of @entity29 and the other smaller planets nearby -- @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33			1
" our work suggests that @entity2 's inward - outward migration could have destroyed a first generation of planets and set the stage for the formation of the mass - depleted terrestrial planets that our solar system has today , " said @entity34 of @entity35 , one of the authors of the paper			1
the theory attempts to explain why our solar system is a bit of an oddball in our galactic neighborhood			0
most other systems that have planets orbiting around a star similar to our sun look very different			0
they generally have at least one planet significantly larger than @entity29 that 's in a closer orbit than @entity31 's			1
but they do n't have many objects farther out			0
maybe that 's because of @entity2 's destructive romp in the early history of the solar system			2
" there is no reason to think that the dominant mode of planet formation throughout the galaxy should not have occurred here , " @entity34 said			2
" it is more likely that subsequent changes have altered its original makeup			0
" he and his co-author -- @entity77 of @entity78 , @entity78 -- are building on a scenario of @entity2 's migration that was previously put forward by other scientists			1
known as the @entity84 scenario , it describes @entity2 getting drawn toward the sun in the early era of the solar system thanks to its huge mass. what stops it from being sucked right into the sun is @entity92			2
the two gas giants start to exert gravitational influence on one another , entering a planetary dance that eventually sends them back farther out into the solar system			0
@entity34 and @entity77 suggest that during its inward journey , @entity2 dragged a load of planetary building blocks , known as planetesimals , along with it			1
that sent the planetesimals smashing into debris in the inner solar system , causing them to break apart and fall into the sun at a faster rate			0
the scientists say they ran a simulation of what would happen if there were also a number of @entity114 in the vicinity as well			0
they found that a wave of decaying planetesimals would steer the super-earths into the sun over the course of 20,000 years			0
" it 's a very effective physical process , " @entity34 said			0
" you only need a few @entity29 masses worth of material to drive tens of @entity29 masses worth of planets into the sun. " on its way back out , @entity2 left some remaining planetesimals in its wake -- the building blocks that over millions of years would come to form @entity29 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 .			1

scientists : an epic migration by @entity2 led to destruction of " super-earths "
the planet - shattering journey laid foundations for @entity29 , they say
