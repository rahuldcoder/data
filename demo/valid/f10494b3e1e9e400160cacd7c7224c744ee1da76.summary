it 's the home of @entity3 politics , steeped in history , tradition and centuries - old pomp			2
but could the ornate splendor of the @entity3 's houses of @entity9 be about to offer a solution to @entity12 's housing crisis ? in all honesty , probably not			1
however , that has n't stopped housing campaign group , @entity16 , from proposing to transform the @entity17 into affordable new homes			1
the group 's eye - catching idea is to move the seat of @entity3 democracy from one of @entity12 's most exclusive neighborhoods to a new location in the city of @entity28 , northern @entity29			1
the vacant @entity30 and @entity31 ( the @entity3 's upper legislative chamber ) left behind would be converted into 364 flats of varying size and scale with prime office space facing the @entity37			0
according to a press release on the proposal from @entity16 , 335 mps from all over the @entity3 currently rent second homes so they can carry out their parliamentary duties more effectively			0
they claim expenses for doing so cost the taxpayer £ 5.26 million ( $ 8 million ) in 2013 alone			0

yet even if the @entity16 proposals were seriously considered , they could come unstuck by the dilapidated state of the parliament building itself			0
@entity83 , @entity84 , said monday that repairs needed to bring the nineteenth century structure up to scratch could come close to £ 3 billion ( $ 4.6 billion )			1
a 2012 study entitled " @entity94 of the @entity17 " found that the building could suffer permanent damage if work was not undertaken to stem leaks , repair crumbling stonework and remove asbestos .			0
