igniting a live man in a cage ; severing the heads of dozens ; kidnapping , raping and selling women and children -- @entity9 ' shocking maltreatment of its captives has become regrettably predictable			1
but that has made their latest decision on the fate of 19 @entity16 prisoners all the more surprising to some			2
on sunday , @entity9 released them			1
ten other @entity19 christians are expected to join them in freedom after a short time in captivity			1
all but one of the @entity16 released were part of a group of 220 @entity19 captured last week during offensives on northern @entity27 villages , said the @entity29 - based @entity28			1
in the shadow of its sadistic mercilessness , the sudden reversal leaves many asking : why ? the group has not explained its decision			1
here are some possible answers			2
it was not a militant commander but an @entity39 judge , said @entity40 , who heads the @entity41 , based in @entity42			2
some of @entity40 's family members are among the captured @entity16			0
his rights group keeps contact with local people , via phone and @entity47 , and has a field team in @entity27 , he said			0
the @entity50 judge asked the @entity16 if they were part of any militia , @entity40 said			0
then he pronounced them not guilty of violating @entity50 law and ordered them released			2
the @entity19 were all from the village of @entity57			1
they have returned home but are keeping quiet for now			0
can @entity60 survive in the @entity61 ? " they were so tired , " @entity40 said			0
they had a closed meeting with a bishop , and then ate and went home			0
" they were treated well , " contacts in @entity57 passed on to @entity40			0
" not to @entity70 , who published a detailed analysis on @entity9 ' religious inner workings this week in the @entity73			1
he was pleased to hear about it , but he felt it fit into @entity9 ' plans			1
" @entity9 has claimed for a long time to follow rules , and it claims that these @entity50 courts will impose limits , " he told @entity0			1
" they can attempt to get credibility by showing that they follow rules and that they have some kind of transparent process that follows their particular implementation of @entity50 law			0
it did win them points with @entity19 activists			1
" it 's a good sign to show that ' we can talk , ' " @entity40 said			0
@entity9 has taken heat even from other islamists who accuse it of rogue justice , especially against @entity99 civilians they 've condemned as " infidels " out of hand			1
it 's part of the reason @entity104 has rejected the group , @entity70 wrote			0
that reduced some of @entity9 ' chances of receiving international moral and financial support , leaving the terror group to make up the gap with other funding			1
and it has led to a violent split with another jihadi group in @entity27 , the @entity116 , according to the @entity117			0
other @entity119 groups in @entity27 have frowned on @entity9 for not submitting to decisions from @entity50 courts			1
the main issue drawing anger from other @entity119 groups revolves around @entity99 civilians , who are @entity9 ' most common victims			1
and the released captives are @entity16			2
but @entity16 activist @entity40 thinks the @entity39 court decision was , in part , a nod to @entity27 @entity99 tribal leaders who negotiated for the @entity16 ' release			2
first , the tribes care deeply about their @entity16 neighbors and do n't want them killed , @entity40 said			0
it also makes the @entity99 tribal leaders look good and gets a rapport started between them and @entity9			1
@entity9 has a very narrow definition of who is a real muslim and who is an apostate			1
foremost , a muslim must practice @entity141 in its eyes			0
the group is quick to practice " takfir , " which amounts to the excommunication of a @entity99 , for things as seemingly petty as shaving off one 's beard or voting in an election			0
@entity9 is quick to kill anyone it condemns , because it wants to create a fanatically pure caliphate with only the strictest devotees , @entity70 wrote			1
@entity9 has executed 125 of its own members for doing things that broke with its strict take on @entity141 , the @entity27 observatory said			2
even in the strictest interpretation of @entity141 , there is a provision for sparing @entity16 , @entity70 wrote			0
social media posts indicate that @entity9 carries out mass killings regularly , but " exempted from automatic execution , it appears , are @entity16 who do not resist their new government			2
" they are required to pay a special tax and acknowledge the new ruling power			0
that 's exactly what the judge ruled , @entity40 said			0
the released @entity19 agreed to acknowledge @entity9 as their new masters and to pay the tax			1
@entity9 is still holding two of @entity171 's @entity16 villagers , @entity40 said			2
they should be released as soon as the taxes are paid			2
he is hoping for the same deal for the other @entity16 villagers , including for his family			0
@entity0 's @entity176 and @entity177 contributed to this report .			0

@entity9 released 19 @entity19 on sunday and plans to release 10 more
the sudden reversal has puzzled many
