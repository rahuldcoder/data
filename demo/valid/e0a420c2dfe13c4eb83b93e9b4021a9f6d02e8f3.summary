@entity1 , @entity2 @entity0 is n't mad at @entity4			1
the rapper 's hit song can be heard playing in the background as @entity8 , the house mother of the @entity11 @entity10 house -- known as @entity12 -- repeats the n - word seven times on camera			1
it appears overboard considering that the hook of the song , " @entity19 , " uses the word only three times per succession			1
@entity8 has been bombarded with claims that she 's just as racist as the fraternity members caught singing a racist song on a bus last weekend			1
it 's an allegation she 's firmly denied , and the @entity28 rapper who wrote " @entity19 " is willing to give her a pass , though he would n't condone her use of the word			1
he does n't hate her , though			2
" i 'm not going to be that person , " he told @entity3			0
" it 's a rock and a hard place			0
i ca n't be as upset at that lady			2
i 'm upset at the fraternity because what they 're saying is a chant that 's just completely disrespectful to the black race			0
as far as that lady goes -- man , that 's an old lady , man			0
" the @entity48 - born rapper , whose real name is @entity0 , said he does n't like giving interviews about race and the n - word because his views are complex and hip - hop stars can be hypocrites when it comes to the topics			1
" it 's hard to ridicule somebody for something that you continue to use in your music , " he said			0
" every ( hip - hop ) artist is using the n - word in their music -- hit records with the n - word in it			1
you ca n't be upset when somebody says it			2
it 's hard to differentiate when you can use it			0
if we do n't want the word used and the word holds such a negative connotation , then we should n't use it at all , period			1
" he compared it to children hearing their parents curse , " and they told you not to curse			0
" context matters , he said			0
if you 're using the word in a negative way , talking down to someone or being sarcastic , that 's wrong			2
" but if it 's somebody that you 've been rocking with or we 're listening to music or whatever , i ca n't be upset , " he said			2
" it 's humanly impossible for you to be upset at a different race saying it when you 're saying it in your music			0
that 's crazy to me			0
" he has a different take on the fraternity members caught clapping , pumping their fists and chanting , " there will never be a ni * * * * @entity10			1
you can hang him from a tree , but he can never sign with me			1
" @entity10 no stranger to scandal " i do n't respect that at all			1
what kind of world are we living in here ? " he asked			0
he took it personally , he said , because he and other hip - hop artists travel the country to perform for fraternities , and to know any fraternity member would harbor such vile feelings toward him " burns my heart			2
" as fellow @entity28 rapper @entity126 noted when he canceled an upcoming show for the @entity128 , @entity0 said people of all races attend his concerts and have a great time together			1
" these fraternities are places that us as hip - hop artists , we come and do amazing shows for these fraternities , like i just did @entity139 , i just did @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , and those guys were great			2
and i 've done a show actually at @entity11 last year , " he said			1
" so to see that that chapter feels that type of way toward the black race , it hurts , man			0
" he even takes a special pride in performing in front of these audiences , he said			0
" we go really hard for these college kids			0
i did n't go to college , so for me , i feel really good when i can make kids who are doing the right thing and going to college ... have a good time because college is so strenuous on the mind and it 's so hard when you 've got to pay tuition and books , trying to survive as a young adult , so that 's why we try to come and make sure the kids have a great time			2
if you go look at the shows , it 's an amazing time			0
" as far as the chances that he 'd ever perform in front of @entity11 's @entity10 chapter in the future , forget about it , he said			1
he does n't care if they were resurrected as an all - black fraternity , he said			1
" i do n't want nothing to do with that because that 's ridiculous			2
i feel like anything they do now is just to cover it up and make it look better , " he said			0
and while it 's disturbing to see young people voicing racist leanings , @entity0 said he 'd prefer to know where someone stands over being misled			1
fraternities considering booking him in the future can keep that in mind , he said			0
" i would rather you did n't even book me for the shows			2
i 'm not no hired monkey , " he said			0
" just do n't be cool with me			0
do n't talk to me			1
if you feel that way about me that you would want to hang me from a tree then do n't talk to me			1
i would stay away from you because obviously my skin color offends your life			0
" @entity3 's @entity203 conducted the interview from @entity1 , @entity11 , and @entity205 wrote from @entity28 .			1

@entity0 says it would be hypocritical to condemn @entity8
the @entity11 @entity10 house mom was caught on tape saying n - word
rapper : if " you would want to hang me from a tree , then do n't talk to me "
