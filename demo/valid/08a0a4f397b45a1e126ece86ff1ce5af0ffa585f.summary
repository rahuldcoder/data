@entity0 once asked : " are we to paint what 's on the face , what 's inside the face or what 's behind it ? " @entity10 's photo book " @entity11 " does all three simultaneously			1
" @entity11 " contains intimate , psychological portraits that @entity10 has created of herself , her family and friends , and their children			1
the book weaves in some photos of other people 's families as well , and includes writing by @entity20 and @entity21			2
using her camera like a paintbrush to stroke the canvas that is her environment , @entity10 explores the experiences of parenting and childhood			1
as a mother to twin sons and a daughter , her photos contain a wide range of raw emotion , ranging from comfort and conflict to sleepiness and satisfaction			2
@entity10 's first photo book , " @entity41 , " focused on the early years of her marriage and adult family life			1
she says her latest book is like a natural segue , as " @entity11 " includes many photos of children			1
the title -- " @entity11 " -- has more than one particular meaning or reference			1
" one is to convey that stage in life when you 're anchored to the home with young children , " @entity10 said			1
" it also references how the home is the first stage in which children learn how to live in every situation			2
in my particular pictures , many of them have a stage - like quality			2
there 's reference to tableau vivant of the past , these constructed images			2
" @entity10 's mother was a big fan of the arts , and she would take young @entity70 and her sister to local art museums where they would copy paintings by hand , progressing from crayons to charcoal and , eventually , to pastels			1
" i wanted to be just like @entity79 and @entity80 ; those were the artists that i would copy a lot as a child , " she said			0
" i think those images got very much stuck into my deep psyche			0
" she emphasizes that her photos are not the everyday snapshots that many parents post on @entity89 -- the photos of children at various stages in their lives , attending birthday parties or riding tricycles			0
the book 's pictures " are n't documents , " @entity10 said			1
" they 're making everyday moments have an eternal quality			2
it reminds us of our more general purpose in life , the meaning in everyday small things			0
" the combination of @entity10 's color palette and the use of natural light fills every inch of her photos with rich detail			1
many of @entity10 's photos contain several generations of her family , highlighting connections between the present , past and future			1
while the people harper photographs are predominantly those most familiar with her , she makes an effort to not allow her camera to completely consume the lives of her subjects			0
" i try to do a very good job of not being overbearing			0
... i bring out the camera only when i have a very specific idea in mind			0
my children know that i 'm an artist , i 'm a photographer			0
they know that , but i do n't think that they see that even in the top 10 of the ways that they relate to me , it 's not as subjects , " she said			0
" i want to keep it that way because otherwise they become so self - conscious and they start doing things which are not natural or genuine			0
" each photo draws the curtain to reveal @entity10 's home stage -- harper lying in bed with her son @entity155 , her husband playing in the backyard with their children , her daughter sitting in a high chair			1
social media follow @ @entity158 on @entity159 to join the conversation about photography			0
regardless of the subject matter of the photos , @entity10 says there is one thing that ties all of them together : light			1
throughout " @entity11 , " @entity10 also manages to effectively create a balance between carefully planned compositions and naturally occurring moments			1
while @entity10 recognizes that raising young children can be intense and tiresome , she emphasizes it is vital to take the initiative to create memories -- not simply wait to capture certain moments			1
this is evident with the self - portrait she made holding her son @entity178 , stopping her family in the midst of their dinner preparations			0
" at the time , i felt like so many parents			0
i felt tired and distracted and busy trying to get things done			0
i felt a little bit of guilt about making this picture , " @entity10 said			1
" and yet i knew somewhere in the back of my head that there was an imperative that i must take moments			2
... you 're just so busy that if you do n't purposefully force it , then it would n't happen			0
" in one photo , viewers are witnesses to an intimate familial relationship as they simply see a mother as she lays her hand gently on her son 's back			2
" it 's a universal mother - and - child gesture , " @entity10 said			1
" it does n't even matter particularly who that individual mother or that individual child is because of the way they 're framed and photographed			0
you ca n't see their faces			0
it 's just the way that her hand is resting on his back			0
it 's ownership and protection and love			0
" @entity10 is an @entity220 photographer based in @entity221			2
