@entity16 ceo @entity15 has released the much - anticipated @entity18 watch -- his company 's first new product since the @entity21			2
@entity15 said the new watch , in addition to telling the time , was a " comprehensive health and fitness companion			2
" but we 're unlikely to hear much about how people will actually use this new product for some time			1
our research has found that smartwatches certainly do have some benefits for users			1
but they also have a hidden , darker side which the companies selling them are unlikely to talk about			1
as part of a research project with @entity40 , we have tried to understand what drives people to invest in smartwatches			1
one participant , a judge , hoped he could keep track of the deluge of emails during long hours in the courtroom when he had to pay attention -- and be seen to pay attention			2
the dilemma is familiar to many of us			2
we spend our days engaged in social interaction			2
huge proportions of our time are taken up with meetings or impromptu encounters with colleagues			0
however when we are in these meetings , our smartphone is buzzing away reminding us that our inbox is filling up			1
we may want to check these incoming messages , but know it would be rude to glance at our phone			1
when one of the first smartwatches came to market , the judge thought he had found the solution to this problem			1
we found that heavy smartwatch users valued how the devices helped them track information as it arrived while still appearing socially attentive			1
it also saved users the hassle of having to dig through their pockets or handbags to find a buzzing phone			1
surprisingly only about half the people we spoke with actually used all the health tracking technology built in to the watches			0
they were more interested in keeping abreast of their inbox than their calorie count			0
we also noticed a worrying side to these new devices as heavy users of the watches incorporate them into their daily routines -- we call it the " phantom device effect			1
" they would compulsive check their watch not just for the time , but for a wide range of information			1
in some cases their new gizmo would become such an instinctive part of their life that even when not wearing one they would check their bare wrist			1
some would feel a phantom buzz , notifying them of an imaginary incoming email			0
the phantom device effect leads us to ask about just how ingrained in our daily habits these devices might become			0
recent research has suggested that average smartphone users check their phone 150 times a day , starting just minutes after waking up			1
we also know this has the effect of extending work into all areas of our lives -- monitoring work emails late into the night or during social or family events			0
we used to worry that the average @entity122 watched television for six hours a day			1
now we accept as a matter of course the fact that we tied to our devices for most of the time we 're awake			1
indeed many of us go to bed with our smart devices quietly monitoring our rhythms as we sleep			0
this raises the question of what impact it will have on our lives			0
in the work @entity137 and i have done on the hidden dangers of wearables , a big big concern is privacy			1
the @entity143 , like most wearables , is essentially a tracking device , recording heart rate , sleep patterns , movement , whereabouts , and much more depending on the apps installed			0
all this is packaged and transmitted to datacentres for analysis			0
the result ? a database of personal information of which the @entity156 could only have dreamed			0
as well as sucking up personal information , wearables could fuel an unhealthy obsession with personal wellness			0
by pumping health and wellbeing information at us non-stop , we start to become a little too focused on our bio-rhythms			0
data which would have been generated only in the most unusual situations now becomes commonplace , making people not just health conscious , but also self - obsessed			0
instead of checking in with social networks , we spend more time checking in with our own bodily rhythms			0
as a result other people start to become more interested in what is going on inside themselves rather than what is happening in the world			0
as we pay more attention to our feed of personal biodata we 're likely to become more anxious about things that we may never have given a second thought to in the past			1
not walking your allotted steps in a day or finding you had a poor sleeping pattern at night can become a source of significant personal guilt or worry			1
as a result , we pour more attention into monitoring and controlling ourselves , giving us less time to do the things which actually make us happy			1
if @entity18 's projections are indeed correct and tens of millions of people purchase smartwatches , it 's likely to create a step change in our lives			2
we already see people routinely posting on social media information they would have only shared with their doctor a few years ago			0
widespread use of smartwatches could mean that instead of relieving our boredom by answering emails , people will spend their time sifting through their biodata stream , planning ways to maximize their personal wellness ratings			2
rather than talking about what was on television last night , people will start comparing charts of their sleeping patterns			0
when this happens we will know that the internet of me has arrived			0

smartwatches have hidden , darker side the companies selling them are unlikely to talk about , says @entity0
@entity0 : average smartphone users check phone 150 times a day , starting just minutes after waking up
we 're also likely to become more anxious about things we may never have given second thought to , he adds
