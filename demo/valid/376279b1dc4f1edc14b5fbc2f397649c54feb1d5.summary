a @entity1 judge ruled monday that @entity3 , the millionaire real estate heir charged with first - degree murder , will be held without bail			1
that 's no big surprise			2
in 2001 -- the last time he was accused of murder and released on bail -- @entity3 fled to @entity10 , where authorities caught him after he tried to shoplift a sandwich from a supermarket			1
as the attorneys sparred in court and witnesses testified monday , they revealed new details about the investigation that led to @entity3 's march 14 arrest , and set the stage for what will surely be a fierce legal battle			1
after the hearing , @entity3 's attorney , @entity24 , spoke with @entity2 's @entity26			1
here are some key details from monday 's hearing and the interview : @entity3 , who appeared in court wearing an orange prison uniform and shackles , was arrested after federal agents tracked his cell phone , according to information presented in court monday			1
investigators knew he 'd left his @entity39 condo with five suitcases on march 10			0
and , since a warrant allowed them to track his cell phone , they saw when it pinged a tower 85 miles east , in @entity44 , @entity45			0
but suddenly , he had stopped using it			0
investigators thought the trail had gone cold			0
" they had no indication of his movement , " said @entity49 , an investigator for the @entity52 district attorney 's office			1
but then , authorities tracked him to @entity52 after he called his voice mail twice from a @entity57 there , @entity49 testified			0
that 's where @entity60 agents found and arrested him			1
last week , court documents revealed @entity3 had a loaded .38 - caliber revolver , 5 ounces of marijuana , his passport and birth certificate , a neck - to - head latex mask with salt - and - pepper hair attached and more than $ 40,000 cash , mostly in $ 100 bills			1
among his possessions , he also had a @entity74 tracking number			0
the package was later intercepted by the @entity60 , prosecutors said in court monday			0
it contained clothing and more than $ 100,000 in cash			0
it 's a case @entity3 even has made himself			1
in " @entity84 , " the @entity83 documentary that featured him , @entity3 said : " you ca n't give someone charged with murder bail because they 're going to run away , of course			1
" in a seconds - long news conference after the hearing monday , @entity93 attorney @entity24 said he had no hope for bail and the judge 's decision was not surprising			1
the legal team , however , did obtain " a lot of information , " he said , and a preliminary hearing was set for april 2			0
" all in all , i think this has been a very good day for us , " he said on the courthouse steps			0
he walked off without elaborating			0
@entity24 cast doubt monday on the validity of the @entity110 arrest warrant that led to @entity3 's detention , and argued that items found in the hotel room search should n't be admissible because detectives may not have had a search warrant at the time			1
he also said a detective and prosecutor interrogated @entity3 for three hours without his attorney present			1
since the weapons and drugs charges @entity3 faces in @entity52 are based on what investigators say they found in his hotel room , this is likely to come up again			1
but prosecutors argued that the matter at hand monday was whether he is a flight risk or a danger to the community			0
the judge sided with the prosecution monday			0
but this is just the first step in what will likely be a lengthy legal battle			0
" as long as @entity1 wants us here , well , we 'll stay here			0
we 'll fight , " @entity24 said monday			0
but the bigger courtroom fight will likely unfold in @entity110 , where the district attorney filed a first - degree murder charge against @entity3 last week			1
@entity3 awaits extradition to @entity110 to face that charge			1
if convicted , he could face the death penalty			0
prosecutors accuse @entity3 of " lying in wait " and killing @entity146 , a crime writer and his longtime confidante , because she " was a witness to a crime			1
" @entity146 was shot in the head in her @entity152 , @entity153 , home in december 2000 , shortly before investigators were set to speak with her about the 1982 disappearance of @entity3 's first wife , @entity156			1
@entity3 has long maintained he had nothing to do with @entity146 's death or his wife 's disappearance			1
" i just do n't think that they had sufficient evidence to have him arrested , " @entity24 said monday			1
" they had a lot of suspicion			0
they 've always had a lot of suspicion			0
and that television show just added to that suspicion			0
" it 's not the first time @entity3 has been accused of murder			1
he admitted to killing and dismembering his neighbor in a 2003 trial , but he was acquitted after arguing he acted in self - defense			2
@entity60 agents have also asked local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where @entity3 lived over the past five decades , a @entity176 law enforcement official said			1
on monday , police said there was a connection between @entity3 and a college student who disappeared from @entity186 's @entity185 in 1971			1
in response to a question at a tuesday news conference from @entity2 , @entity188 police chief @entity187 said : " there 's nothing in the files to indicate ( @entity3 ) was questioned " at the time of her disappearance			1
" we do n't know if they ever had any personal contact , " the chief added			2
the connection in the case was one of proximity , @entity187 said			0
@entity3 owned a health - food store in @entity188 , and @entity207 was last seen across the street from the store near a bus stop			1
she had purchased dried prunes from the store earlier			2
@entity24 brushed off the accusation , saying that his client " may have been in @entity214 when @entity215 disappeared			2
" other cases in @entity218 , the @entity219 and @entity153 are also getting a new look			2
@entity3 was placed on suicide watch , according to police , but @entity24 said last week that @entity3 needed to be in a hospital setting , not because of the possibility of suicide , but because he has serious medical conditions			1
the 71 - year - old is suffering from hydrocephalus , which required brain surgery a couple of years ago , @entity24 said			2
doctors implanted a stent on the right side of his head , the attorney said last week			2
" at the same time he was in the hospital he had an operation on his esophagus to remove cancer			0
so he 's got some serious health issues			2
... he 's lost a lot of weight			2
he 's not in good health , " @entity24 said			2
@entity3 appeared in court monday with his head shaved , the stent prominent			2
@entity24 also said that @entity3 is " mildly autistic " and has received treatment in the past from one of the country 's leading experts in @entity253 's syndrome and autism			1
" he 's quiet and he 's reserved and he 's actually bashful			2
but he 's always been looked upon as a little bit odd , " @entity24 said			0
" and what we discovered 15 years ago was that he 's autistic , mildly autistic , but it explains a lot of his , what others look upon as unusual or bizarre behavior			0
" but @entity24 said his client 's health struggles do n't mean he 's incompetent to stand trial			2
and @entity24 said they 're eager to go to court and fight the accusations against him			0
" he 's a little frail and he has some memory problems sometimes , " @entity24 said			0
" but he 's not incompetent			0
" @entity2 's @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity26 and @entity273 contributed to this report .			0

police chief in @entity186 says @entity3 owned store where college student bought prunes before she disappeared
@entity3 's attorney : " i just do n't think that they had sufficient evidence to have him arrested "
