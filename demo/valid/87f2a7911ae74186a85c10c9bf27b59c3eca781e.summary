@entity3 prime minister @entity2 's recent speech to the @entity4 has received disproportionate media attention across the world : the leader of @entity9 's most important client state in the @entity10 defies the reservations of the @entity12 , abusing @entity4 as a platform for his @entity3 election campaign			1
disregarding @entity3 's already strained bilateral relations with the @entity9 , @entity2 readily risked the consequences of humiliating the @entity18 administration in exchange for less than an hour of political self - manifestation -- typical for a man who is domestically known to be not much of a statesman			1
@entity2 is a charismatic speaker and a passionate @entity3 - advocate , however , his personal and political interests have always taken precedence over serving @entity3 's national interests			1
political survival has been the maxim of his domestic and foreign policies			1
@entity2 joins a long list of @entity3 politicians overwhelmed by the plurality and polarization of domestic public opinion			2
so far he has been just another @entity3 leader seeking " easy " short - term answers to fundamentally strategic problems , thereby further protracting an already protracted conflict			0
as a puppet of ideological , conservative playmakers who whole - heartedly reject a two - state solution , @entity2 has been held hostage by the likes of foreign minister @entity42 and economy minister @entity43 who pursue a discriminatory policy of sectarian segregation intending to contain @entity48 public dissidence through mere coercion			1
consequently , @entity2 's foreign policy vis - à - vis the peace process has been a disaster			1
he took over from @entity53 and @entity54 -- two politicians who at least believed in a two - state solution and were ready to make sacrifices to keep the peace process alive			0
@entity3 leaders typically fall into two categories : those who believe in peace and those that have the power to make peace			0
@entity53 was the former , and @entity2 long seemed like he could become the latter			0
in reality , however , @entity2 is neither			0
he has given in to a toxic form of @entity72 nationalism , disregarded @entity3 's relatively good regional position vis - à - vis its otherwise - occupied @entity75 neighbors ; he has continued to build settlements out of spite , thought of ever new preconditions for bilateral negotiations with the @entity48 and waged a ruthless war against @entity82 without a clear strategic endgame -- a war that was lost militarily and in terms of international reputation			1
apart from the tragic effects of @entity2 's policy on the peace process , his stubbornness has alienated allies in @entity92 and @entity93			1
while the @entity75 world has been widely apathetic about the @entity3 - @entity48 issue amid regional disintegration , partners on both sides of the @entity96 have tried to facilitate the revitalization of constructive peace talks			2
yet , @entity2 chose to ignore external initiatives , retracting to a @entity72 nationalist rhetoric founded on security paranoia , self - victimization and the illusion of @entity3 autarky in security and defense			0
as a consequence , @entity3 's foreign relations with its most important strategic partners have noticeably cooled			2
@entity18 's @entity10 focus has shifted from the @entity3 / @entity48 issue to a rapprochement with @entity116			0
@entity92 lawmakers are considering recognizing @entity48 statehood despite @entity3 objections			0
more importantly , many traditionally @entity121 publics have turned their back on the jewish state			0
younger generations in particular refuse to accept the narrative that shaped their parental generation : @entity3 as the @entity127 in a fight against @entity129			0
@entity3 's monopoly on victimhood has been undermined by an inflexible , uncompromising short - minded policy towards a @entity48 people under occupation whose narrative of victimhood increasingly finds attentive ears in the @entity138			1
at first sight , then , the prospect of four more years of @entity2 , does not sound too promising -- at least in regards to the peace process			2
at a closer look , however , a continuation of @entity2 's policies might actually help the @entity48 cause			1
his implicit rejection of the two - state solution ; his prioritization of short - term security over sustainable security solutions ; his pursuit of a toxic @entity72 nationalist agenda justifying an intensification of sectarianism between @entity3 and the @entity156 as well as within @entity3 , are all factors that will leave @entity3 increasingly isolated			0
his @entity3 - first narrative might win @entity2 votes within a highly polarized electorate that in recent years has become more and more right - wing amid a top - down constructed climate of fear			0
@entity164 ' and @entity166 's mid-tech missile capability , @entity168 's socio - political disintegration and subsequent rise of @entity171 non-state actors , have been used by the @entity2 government to create an @entity75 bogyman ostensibly threatening the jewish state 's very existence -- a new bogyman coexisting side - by - side with @entity2 's " favorite " bogeyman , @entity116			2
despite @entity2 's pre-occupation with security , the derailment of the peace process has not been much of a topic during the campaign so far			1
if @entity2 receives another mandate on tuesday , @entity3 will be further driven into the international offside , pressure from the @entity138 will increase and thereby the @entity48 cause will receive ever more attention and support from policymakers and publics across the world			2
@entity2 has become somewhat of a villain in the @entity138 -- an untrustworthy , short - sighted politician who in comparison to his counterparts in @entity196 appears to lack the willingness to compromise , cooperate and empathize			0
thus , while another term of @entity2 will not be in the national interest of @entity3 , it will very likely serve the @entity48 interests .			1

political survival has been maxim of @entity2 's domestic and foreign policies , says @entity206
@entity206 : @entity2 's foreign policy vis - à - vis the peace process has been disaster
new term for @entity2 will not be in national interest of @entity3 , it will serve @entity48 interests , @entity206 adds
