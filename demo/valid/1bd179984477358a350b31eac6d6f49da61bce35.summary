it was an act of frustration perhaps more commonly associated with golf 's fictional anti-hero @entity3 than the world 's reigning no 1			2
but when @entity8 pulled his second shot on the eighth hole of the @entity11 into a lake friday , he might as well have been channeling the much loved @entity15 character			1
before continuing his round with a dropped ball , the four - time major winner launched the 3 - iron used to play the offending shot into the water as well			1
" ( it ) felt good at the time , " a rueful @entity8 later said of the incident in comments carried by the @entity25 website			1
" i just let frustration get the better of me			2
it was heat of the moment , and i mean , if it had of been any other club i probably would n't have but i did n't need a 3 â€‘ iron for the rest of the round so i thought , why not			1
" the club " must have went a good 60 , 70 yards , " he joked			2
@entity8 composed himself to finish with a second round of 70 , leaving him one - under for the tournament and eight shots off the pace set by leader @entity40			1
while an improvement on last weeks performance at the @entity47 event , where he failed to make the cut , the @entity42 's frustration with elements of his game was still clear			1
" i think every golfer feels it because i do n't hit shots like the one i hit on 8 on the range , " he said			0
" that 's what really bothers me , the fact that i get out on the course and i hit shots that i 'm not seeing when i 'm in a more relaxed environment			0
" so it 's a little bit of mental , a little bit of physical			0
it 's just everything is not quite matching up			0
" elsewhere on the course , @entity64 scored a two - under - par 71 to remain in second position overall , two shots behind @entity40			0
, @entity69 carded an impressive 68 to finish the day three shots off the pace at six - under while @entity72 and @entity73 are tied for fourth on four - under .			0
