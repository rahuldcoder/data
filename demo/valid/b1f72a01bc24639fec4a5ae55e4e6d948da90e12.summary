@entity0 @entity3 's attorney made one thing clear during her opening statement in the @entity7 trial : he did it			1
" it was him , " defense attorney @entity10 told jurors			1
@entity3 carried one of the pressure cooker bombs on april 15 , 2013 , and placed it near the finish line , she said			1
he was there when a police officer was killed			2
he was involved in a shootout with police			2
the accused bomber will not sidestep any of his actions , @entity21 said			2
so , why even a trial at all ? because there 's disagreement over why @entity3 did it , @entity21 said			1
@entity3 was influenced by his brother , @entity28 , @entity21 said			1
he was enlisted by his brother to commit these horrific acts , she said			1
the first day of the trial provided jurors with a peek at the strategies of the prosecution and defense			1
based on their opening statements , both sides agree on the basic facts around the attacks -- who carried them out and how			2
but both sides presented divergent views of why @entity3 carried out the attacks			1
the goal of the @entity3 brothers was to kill as many people as possible , @entity48 prosecutor @entity47 said during his initial statement to jurors			1
the prosecutor described in detail the deaths of three victims near the finish line of the 2013 @entity58 and painted a picture of @entity3 as a holy warrior committed to violence			1
more than 260 others were maimed or injured by two pressure cooker bombs that exploded within 12 seconds of each other			2
a fourth person , an @entity66 police officer , was ambushed and killed in his patrol car three days after the bombings as @entity3 and his brother , @entity69 , allegedly ran from police			1
@entity28 , 26 , was killed after a gunbattle with police			2
so it is @entity3 who is on trial , charged with 30 counts related to the bombings			1
@entity47 said @entity3 's actions after the bombings -- going to @entity79 to buy a gallon of milk , hanging out with friends -- show that he did n't care about what he did			1
to the contrary , the prosecutor told jurors , he believed he had done good			1
the motive for the attacks can be found in the boat that ultimately became @entity3 's hideout before his arrest , he said			1
there , @entity3 allegedly wrote messages explaining that he believed the @entity48 government is an enemy of @entity96			1
@entity58 bombing timeline @entity3 listened to jihadist lectures and songs , and had an online presence in which he espoused a radical view of @entity96 , @entity47 said			1
he had a collection of magazines published by @entity104 , one with instructions for building the same type of bomb used in the @entity58 attack , he said			1
the defense pinned the radicalization on @entity69			1
@entity21 showed two side - by - side photos in court : one of the brothers smiling , and one of them carrying backpacks linked to the attacks			2
the attacks were " incomprehensible , they 're inexcusable , " she said , but also asked , who turned @entity3 from the smiling kid into a bomber ? it was @entity69 who self - radicalized , and @entity69 who influenced his brother to follow him , she argued			1
at the outset of the trial , @entity47 spoke in detail to the jury about the lives ended by the pair of bombs at the marathon			2
@entity134 , an 8 - year - old spectator , was standing with his family cheering runners on when the second bomb exploded just feet away			1
@entity134 was only 4 feet 5 inches tall and weighed 70 pounds , the prosecutor said			1
the bomb blew large holes into the boy 's chest and organs -- " tore large chunks of flesh out of @entity134 's body , " @entity47 said			1
the first witness the prosecution called wednesday was @entity149 , executive director of the @entity150			2
@entity151 provided some facts about the marathon , but assistant u.s. attorney @entity154 also asked him to talk about the day of the bombings			1
the prosecution played videos of the first explosion , then the second , showing people scrambling in the aftermath			2
@entity149 let out a long sigh as one of the videos was paused			2
" every day you walk outside , you are in that area , " testified @entity164 , the manager at @entity165 , a running store close to where the bombs went off			0
he was emotional as he vividly recounted what sounded to him like a loud cannon , and the instant cloud of smoke that covered the windows			0
@entity164 recalled stepping outside to the smell of gunpowder and burning hair , and cries for help			0
the decisions about who to aid first -- those among the injured needing help before others -- still haunt him , he said			0
there were cries , sirens and screams , he said in answer to prosecutors ' questions			0
he sniffled as a photo of the blown - out storefront was shown in the court			0
he told the jury the plea he heard from one of the injured : " stay with me , stay with me			0
" wednesday 's testimony centered on the stories of the survivors			1
@entity3 's lawyers opted not to cross-examine any of the witnesses who testified to what they lived through that day			1
@entity204 and @entity205 were part of a large group who were present to cheer on a family member			1
@entity204 took the witness stand and described the videos he shot after the blasts			0
it was an instinct to record the scene , he said			0
" i was blown through the air			0
there was a deafening explosion , " he said			0
he saw bodies and faces also tumble through the air			0
his videos captured the chaos , the cries for help , people using any material they could find to help perform first aid			0
at one point , @entity204 recalled , he sat on something hot , only to realize he was sitting on pieces of burning metal and shards			0
@entity233 testified that she was watching the race , but also looking after her 5 - year - old , @entity237 , who was a bit bored			0
after the blast , she could n't feel her legs			0
" my bones were literally laying next to me on the sidewalk , " she said			0
" at that point i thought that was the day i would die			0
" her first instinct was for @entity237 's safety			1
she asked @entity247 to take her if she was indeed dying , but to let her know that @entity237 was ok			0
somehow , she said , despite the confusion and her pain , she could hear his voice calling her			0
@entity233 now wears a prosthesis			0
@entity252 was a high school senior on the day of the bombings			1
her testimony centered on her near certainty that she would die that day			0
she passed out and awoke to a group of men attending to her , putting pressure on her leg , trying to find where she was bleeding			0
one man put his forehead on her head and told her she would be ok			0
but then , another man said he could see her eyes were going white , she testified			0
" i could feel my body going tingly and i was getting increasingly cold			2
i knew i was dying , " she told the jury			0
it took nearly two months of juror interviews -- 256 people over 22 court days -- to select the jury in the bombing trial			0
the group includes 18 people from across the socioeconomic spectrum , but the group is almost exclusively white			0
race has been an issue raised by @entity3 's defense during four unsuccessful attempts to move the death penalty trial from @entity0			1
his attorneys argued that the way the court issues jury summons led to picking a panel that 's older and whiter than the community at large			1
but prosecutors argued that the jury had been picked properly			0
" the prosecution got exactly what they wanted , " said @entity1 legal analyst @entity292 , a criminal defense attorney in @entity293			1
middle - aged white jurors tend to be more likely to support death penalty verdicts , he said			0
" it 's a target demographic for a death penalty jury			2
" just one juror seemed to combine youth and ethnic diversity			0
a college student who is taking a break from his studies , he said his mother was born in @entity307 and converted from @entity96 to the @entity309 faith			0
the @entity310 , a boat in which @entity3 sought cover after the police gunbattle , also is expected to be a key piece of evidence			1
the prosecution is seeking to remove a panel on which @entity3 allegedly scrawled incriminating messages so jurors can see it			1
@entity47 has said the boat is too large to bring into the courthouse			2
the defense , however , wants the jury to see the entire boat , complete with bullet holes			2
defense attorney @entity325 argued that cutting out a panel would take the written words out of context and would n't fairly reflect @entity3 's state of mind			1
court papers have already given the public a glimpse of several statements @entity3 allegedly wrote inside the boat : " the @entity48 government is killing our innocent civilians , " he allegedly wrote			1
" i ca n't stand to see such evil go unpunished			0
" " we @entity339 are one body			2
you hurt one , you hurt us all			0
" " now i do n't like killing innocent people			0
it is forbidden in @entity96 but due to said ( unintelligible ) it is allowed			0
" " stop killing our innocent people and we will stop			0
" @entity1 's @entity346 reported from @entity0 , and @entity347 wrote in @entity348			2
@entity1 's @entity349 contributed to this report .			2
