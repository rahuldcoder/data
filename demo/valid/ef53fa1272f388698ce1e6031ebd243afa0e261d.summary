if you were the lucky recipient of a bunch of fragrant roses this @entity2 , it 's likely that they came from @entity5			1
the country is the third largest exporter of cut flowers in the world , accounting for around 35 % of all sales in the @entity11			1
famed for being long - lasting , @entity5 's roses , carnations and summer flowers are also popular in @entity15 and the @entity16 where last week several growers showcased their blooms at the @entity19 in @entity20			1
the event is one of the industry 's largest and gathers over 80 exhibitors from across the world , with several @entity27 growers also representing the @entity29 continent alongside @entity5			1
the country 's flower power is attributed to its sunny climate , which enables high - quality blossoms to be grown year - round without the need for expensive - to - run greenhouses			2
@entity5 also has excellent transport links to @entity37 , and from there , the rest of the world through @entity41 airport , which has a terminal dedicated specially to the transport of flowers and vegetables			1
this means that delicate floral cargo which is perishable in nature can be shifted from growers to consumers swiftly			0
more than 500,000 people in the country depend on the trade according to the @entity54 , with roughly half of the country 's 127 flower farms concentrated around @entity58 , around 90 kilometers northwest of @entity41			2
" @entity66 is a big center because it 's a freshwater lake and it is not very far from @entity41 , which makes transport easy , " says @entity59 , technical director of @entity60 , a company which provides hydration , transport and storage for the cut - flower industry			2
" people have been growing flowers there for a long time so there is a skilled labor force in place , " he adds			2
activists have expressed concerns over the environmental impact that the booming trade could inflict on the lake , but local farmers have been working with the @entity83 in order to make sure that water levels are not affected : " it 's about putting together a strong business case about why it 's good for growers to save water and ways to manage that , " says @entity92 , @entity83 technical adviser who calls the collaboration " a story of success			0
" @entity97 's location 1,884 meters above sea level is particularly fertile ground for medium - sized roses which are often found in the floral sections of @entity11 supermarkets , whereas farms in higher altitudes yield bigger blooms popular in @entity15 : " it 's a consumer preference			0
in @entity107 people will buy a single rose , so if it 's bigger it naturally looks more spectacular , whereas in the @entity109 they buy bunches more often , " says @entity59			0
big business horticulture has been one of the top foreign exchange earners for @entity5 , and the flower industry alone raked in around $ 600m last year , exporting 124,858 tonnes valued at around $ 507m in 2013			1
nearly two thirds of exports are destined for @entity118 , where they are resold to florists through auctions which present a safe avenue into the market for less seasoned growers : " if you sell through an auction and you have a good quality product , people will be competing for your flowers which will give you a better price , " @entity59 says			0
while @entity37 remains the biggest destination for @entity5 flowers due to its relative geographic proximity and good transport links , this has left producers vulnerable to turmoil on the continent , such as the recent recession			1
" it has had an impact on the sector and we have experienced a slowdown in demand , which slows down business , " says @entity141 , ceo of the @entity142			0
@entity5 exports also suffered when in october of last year the @entity11 imposed import taxes on cut flowers from the country , but the levy was lifted on christmas day allowing @entity5 producers to storm @entity2 sales			1
@entity141 says that the industry is now exploring other markets such as @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 , and adds that direct flights from @entity41 airport play a crucial role in helping the @entity5 flower business take off globally : " a direct flight to the destination is key owing to the fact that this is fresh produce and it needs to get to the end user quickly in order to guarantee quality			2
it also makes it less expensive , " she says			0
@entity5 growers are now lending their floral expertise to neighboring @entity175 by partnering with the country 's government to create a 35 hectare flower park 60 kilometers from @entity175 's capital @entity180			1
it 's hoped that the park will eventually produce three million stems per year and kick - start @entity175 's floriculture sector , which could pump more than $ 200 million into the country 's economy by 2017			0
editor 's note : each week , @entity188 explores the trends , figures and initiatives shaping @entity60			0
from education and energy to technology and innovation , it showcases topics and influential sectors driving countries on the continent .			0
