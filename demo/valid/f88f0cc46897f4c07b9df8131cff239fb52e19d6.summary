quick , imagine a castle : it probably looks a lot like @entity4 's @entity3 , the turreted inspiration for @entity7 's @entity6			1
each year , more than 1.5 million travelers are inspired to make the steep walk or catch a horse - drawn carriage to reach this castle perched on a rocky outcropping in the @entity14 countryside			1
" people have always been interested in celebrities and powerful people and their homes , " says @entity15 , pr officer for the @entity16 of @entity17			0
" immediately after the death of @entity24 in 1886 , the first tourists came and wanted to see what their king had built as his private residence			0

some of the world 's most - visited palaces , found across @entity37 , feature red exteriors , pagodas , gates and carvings			1
consider @entity44 's gold - spired @entity42 , where @entity46 kings lived for 150 years , and where 8 million annual visitors now traipse through ornate rooms , manicured gardens and temples , including one that houses a revered @entity53 carved from a single block of jade			1

@entity84 's most visited , @entity85 , received 365,000 in 2013			1
that said , there can be a downside to having too many visitors -- these are delicate , historic structures that have existed for hundreds of years , and some , like @entity3 , limit daily entries			2
but it 's hard to stem curiosity when it comes to the lives of the blue - blooded			1
