modern women are suffering from an energy crisis			1
competing in the workplace , caring for aging parents and trying teenagers , and busier than ever , we use anything we can to duct - tape our lives and ourselves together : comfort foods , alcohol , energy drinks , and an expanding array of antidepressants , anti-anxiety meds , painkillers and amphetamines			2
all in an effort to maintain our unnatural pace			2
welcome to the increasingly altered states of @entity21			1
@entity21 are about 5 % of the world 's population , yet we take half its pills , and 80 % of its @entity27 over-medication has led to record numbers of opiate overdoses and also to a growing number of women taking antidepressants -- one out of four and counting , according to a report issued by the pharmacy benefit manager , @entity35			1
this is creating a " new normal , " bringing closer the tipping point for when other women will seek chemical assistance			1
like steroids in baseball , when everyone starts doing it , the players who do n't are at a disadvantage			2
the overuse of psychiatric medication is called cosmetic psychopharmacology , and it 's like cosmetic surgery : as more women get breast implants , the rest of us feel flat chested			1
but the new normal is n't normal at all			1
certain antidepressants called @entity56 ( selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ) create artificially stable and elevated levels of serotonin , the brain chemical that helps regulate mood , which can dampen empathy and emotional reactivity , while higher doses can engender apathy			1
our moods change , and this emotional fluidity helps us to be adaptable and resilient			1
we are dynamic and responsive to our environment			2
there is a biological advantage to this sensitivity ; we need to know what our nonverbal babies need , what our mates are thinking and to sense danger in our surroundings			2
@entity80 -- being sensitive , caring deeply and occasionally being acutely dissatisfied -- is actually a natural source of power			1
it helps to ensure not only our survival , but that of our offspring			0
women 's emotionality is a sign of health , not disease , and it is our single biggest psychological asset			1
yet many of us are being convinced to medicate it away			0
the pharmaceutical industry spends billions in payments to physicians and direct to consumer advertising			0
nine out of 10 pharmaceutical companies spend less on research and development than @entity104 doses of antidepressant advertising aimed at women advance the question from " should i take an antidepressant ? " to " which one should i take ? " these medications can have more far - reaching effects than most people realize , blunting empathy , passion , and sensitivity			1
ssris dampen sexual desire and response , making it difficult to climax and interfering with the evaluation of potential romantic partners			1
ssris also make it hard to cry , an important signal to ourselves and those around us that something is very wrong			0
tears , and the emotions beneath them , can offer a profound lesson in how people 's behavior affects others			1
we cry when we 're touched by the poignancy of humanity , or when we 're angry , or frustrated by injustice			0
and yet , women apologize for their tears , especially in the workplace , where we 've been socialized to shut down expressed emotion ; it interferes with our typical agenda of forward - momentum , and it makes people uncomfortable			1
the problem with shutting it down is that we 're stifling a piece that we need , that our partners and families need , and that society needs , particularly as women continue to ascend to the upper reaches of business and government			1
the world needs more compassion , sensitivity , intuition and empathy			0
@entity160 , rape , murder , and corporate malignancy will flourish in their absence			0
@entity165 comes from discomfort -- and awareness that something is wrong			0
sadness and fear are not always symptoms to be medicated			0
anxiety and tension come foremost from the denial of emotions , from their repression			0
my patients want to feel better , but really what many of them need is to get better at feeling			0
the shame that for centuries has been used by our culture to separate men from their true feelings is now spreading to women , who , by their biology , are the last and much needed connection to this natural place			1
as we embrace new technologies , we need to be careful that we do n't go too far away from nature and what 's natural for us as social primates			1
we insist on all natural products in our baby food and household cleaners			2
why do n't we insist on natural moods for ourselves ? if we can live in a way that is more aligned to what is genuine for us , we will be calmer , more at peace and more fulfilled			2
but we are drowning in artificiality			0
there is a " plastic vortex " of garbage the size of @entity215 floating in the @entity216 , synthetic fillers in our breasts and faces , virtual sex partners on our computers and artificially enhanced rationality from serotonergic antidepressants			0
we compulsively consume this fakery without satiation or satisfaction , because it is impossible to fill up on something that is almost enough			0
we need a course correction , away from the synthetic , so that we can live lives that honor how we feel			0
but to do that , we must be able to feel , to be our moody , authentic selves			2
that is the first step to wellness and to wholeness			0
medicating yourself into complacency may leave you unshaken , but it also may leave you unfeeling and apathetic , making it impossible to address the causes of your pain			0
do n't put the alarm on mute .			0
