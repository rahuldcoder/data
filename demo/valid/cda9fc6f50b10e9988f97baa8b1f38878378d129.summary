there is plenty of noise surrounding the nuclear deal that is being negotiated with @entity5			1
but for all the heat generated by @entity9 prime minister @entity8 's speech to @entity10 and an ill - conceived , panicky letter to @entity5 's leadership organized by @entity13 -- the latest debate is creating little light			1
indeed , it may actually be obscuring the fundamental issue of @entity5 's own foreign policies -- and whether @entity20 's destabilizing activities abroad should preclude a deal at all			1
unfortunately , few in @entity10 have taken the time to consider the matter in a thoughtful , coherent manner			0
there are , of course , certain realities that should not be in dispute : yes , @entity5 is a regional adversary to a number of its @entity32 neighbors and @entity9			2
and it does aim to provoke @entity35 - led @entity34 and generally to sow seeds of sectarian @entity37 abroad			0
in addition , the @entity40 's @entity39 force is alleged to have provided training and weapons to a range of militants -- @entity53 and @entity54 in @entity55 and the @entity57 territories , @entity59 's regime in @entity60 , @entity51 rebels in @entity52 , disenfranchised @entity46 in @entity47 , and even to militant groups in @entity49			0
most recently , @entity5 has been directing military operations by @entity64 - equipped @entity63 forces against @entity66 militants in @entity63 , forces that have been aided by @entity64 airstrikes			2
@entity8 grasped the irony , starkly warning " when it comes to @entity5 and @entity66 , the enemy of your enemy is your enemy			0
" ( although sen. @entity75 appears to be confused , insisting at a march 11 hearing of the @entity77 that @entity5 must be unhappy with @entity64 airstrikes against @entity66 )			0
yet the question that @entity8 did not answer , and which sen. @entity13 and his 46 colleagues have not even asked , is what exactly should be done about @entity5 's activities abroad ? many in @entity10 fail to grasp that foreign minister @entity85 and his colleagues in @entity5 's @entity87 , with their @entity64 - @entity88 and understanding of plural democracies , are not cut from the same cloth as the hardliners in charge of @entity5 's @entity94 ( its commander , @entity95 turns up in @entity55 and @entity63 despite a travel and asset ban )			1
and yes , it was the @entity39 force that provided the explosives and operatives that led to significant @entity64 casualties in the early years of the @entity102			0
to answer the question of what to do about @entity5 's activities , it is important to understand that the nuclear agreement , while it has little to do with @entity5 's arms transfers or extracurricular activities in the region , can lay the groundwork for a far more serious engagement about @entity5 's role in the region -- and in a manner that addresses head - on the concerns of its @entity35 neighbors , many of whom are eager to resume longstanding trading relationships with @entity5			1
the reality is that @entity5 's reemergence into the international community in a postnuclear deal environment would allow the @entity124 ( @entity124 ) to assert its interests in the region , and to lay out expectations of @entity5 as a constructive partner			1
it might even lead to quiet , back - channel diplomacy about the future of @entity60 without @entity59			0
none of this is possible in the absence of the nuclear deal			2
once @entity5 begins to navigate its relationships as more than the isolated , nuclear - threshold pariah state it currently is , there will be less tolerance internationally for destabilizing arms transfers and the training of would - be insurgents			2
and there is no need to rely on @entity5 's word that it will refrain from such activities			1
as @entity148 resolutions are rewritten to lift the ban on uranium enrichment in @entity5 , the ban on @entity5 arms transfers can and should remain in place , with @entity148 member states required to report to the @entity148 any violations of that ban by @entity5			0
ultimately , as important as the nuclear issue is , the real promise of a deal is only partially about limiting the country 's nuclear ambitions -- it is also about returning stability to a shattered region , exhausted and impoverished by war			1
@entity5 , the @entity64 and @entity32 allies can be partners in such a process with clear eyes and no illusions about how difficult it will be			0
a nuclear deal is just the beginning .			2

talks are continuing over @entity5 's nuclear *program*
