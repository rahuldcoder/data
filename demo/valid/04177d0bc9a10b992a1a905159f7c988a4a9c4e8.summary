he 's a virtual unknown to @entity3 audiences , but @entity4 proved he had what it takes as a late night host			1
@entity4 's debut as the fourth host of @entity11 ' " @entity10 " on monday night was one of the smoothest first episodes of any new talk show hosts in recent memory			1
ignoring the usual five minutes or so of monologue jokes , @entity4 launched right into a star - studded pre-taped bit that showed how he got the job of host : by picking up one of @entity11 president @entity24 ' @entity23 golden ticket dropped by @entity25 ( a joke referencing rumors that she was in talks for the job @entity4 won )			2
@entity4 received advice from @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 as he trained to be the best host he could be			0
in a nod to one of his influences , @entity36 , @entity4 brought out his two guests , @entity39 and @entity40 simultaneously			1
in the midst of their conversation , @entity39 , who was sporting a ring , seemed to confirm ( with a " maybe " ) that she had just married @entity47 , though that still has n't been confirmed and it may be that @entity4 , @entity40 and @entity39 are pulling our leg			2
the highlight of the show , however , was @entity4 and @entity40 ' rapid fire rundown of his movie career , which has to be seen to be believed			0
@entity4 's predecessor , @entity56 , sang the new show 's theme song , and @entity4 - who co-starred in the musical film " @entity60 " - ended his first show with an original song			0
if @entity64 reaction is any indication , @entity4 charmed enough viewers to draw viewers back tuesday night .			0
