@entity1 the handwritten checklist looks like something any teenaged girl might make ahead of a vacation trip : makeup , bras , underwear , boots , an epilator			0
but this list was apparently made by the three @entity13 schoolgirls suspected of traveling from @entity1 to @entity14 to join @entity15 , according to @entity13 's @entity17 newspaper , which has seen the document			1
the girls ' families told @entity13 lawmakers tuesday they had no idea what the girls were planning , and said they were baffled by the teenagers ' decision to leave their homes and families			1
the three @entity1 classmates -- @entity30 , 15 ; @entity31 , 16 ; and @entity32 , 15 -- boarded a @entity34 plane from @entity1 's @entity35 to @entity36 on february 17			0
they are thought to have crossed the @entity39 border into @entity14 within days			0
relatives also had harsh words for police , who they said failed to keep them informed after a close friend of the girls headed to @entity14 in december			1
@entity32 's father , @entity46 , told lawmakers at a hearing of the @entity49 that he had no idea his daughter was planning to go or that she might have been radicalized			1
@entity52 , the older sister of @entity30 , said her sister had been into " normal teenage things , " like watching " @entity57 , " reading and playing games on her phone			0
there was nothing to indicate she was radicalized , she said			0
@entity60 , first cousin of @entity31 , said that if the family had spotted any signs of radicalization , " we would have been very effective in stepping in and querying " that thinking			2
she also said she had no idea how her cousin accessed the money needed for the trip			2
committee chairman @entity69 said it was " every parent 's nightmare that this should happen " and said he could only imagine the families ' distress and anguish			0
who are the missing @entity13 girls ? the families ' criticism of law enforcement hinges on a february 5 letter from the police which was given to the three girls to give to their parents , rather than being sent directly to the parents			1
the families claim they were not told about a 15 - year - old friend of the girls going to @entity14 weeks earlier -- and say that had they known , they might have been able to prevent their daughters from traveling too			2
metropolitan police chief @entity90 apologized for his officers ' failure to get the letter directly to the parents , in his testimony before the committee			1
but he also pointed out the difficulties for police in conducting what was at that time a missing person inquiry for the first girl who left , with no sign that these three were planning to follow suit			1
@entity90 said police were reviewing their procedures in light of what had happened			2
assistant commissioner @entity107 told the committee there was a " steady flow " of girls trying to travel to @entity14 , perhaps one or two a month			2
he said subsequent police investigations indicated the three girls had paid in cash for their plane tickets to @entity39 at a local travel agency , using money linked to the theft of jewelry from their families			1
none of the girls was reported missing until several hours after the flight had left for @entity36			2
however , the families ' lawyer asked how they had managed , as minors , to board the flight without being challenged			0
@entity128 footage also later showed that the girls spent much of the next day waiting at a bus station on the outskirts of @entity36 -- raising more questions about why they were not spotted then and whether @entity13 police had communicated effectively with @entity39 authorities			1
@entity107 said that two people have been arrested in relation to child abduction in relation to the first girl who went missing , who has not been named			0
asked how the @entity13 might be able to get the girls back , @entity107 cited an incentive : as long as they 're not connected to terrorist offenses , they 'll be able to return to their families			1
@entity107 said police have no evidence that the girls have been involved in terrorism - related activities , and if that remained the case , they would n't be treated as terrorists upon their return			1
who has been recruited to @entity15 from the @entity153 ? the list was reportedly found in the bedroom of one of the girls and handed to police after her family realized she was missing			1
it detailed items to buy , such as underwear , a mobile phone and cosmetics , and estimated travel costs , apparently totaling £ 2,190 ( $ 3,296 )			0
the biggest single cost was the three plane tickets to @entity39 , the newspaper said , at just over £ 1,000			0
the list , written on a page from a diary planner , had initials indicating which of the girls was to buy what or who the items were for			2
it 's not clear where they would have gotten the money to meet the costs			0
over the weekend , the girls ' families asked for an apology from @entity1 's @entity184 over the force 's handling of the case			1
the police said in a statement saturday that after the first girl went missing in december , a police officer spoke to seven of her school friends at @entity193 -- including @entity30 , @entity31 , and @entity32 -- as potential witnesses who might have information about the missing girl			0
a deputy principal at the girls ' school was present for the meeting and afterward contacted the parents of the seven girls , on the advice of police , and told them that the girls ' friend , referred to only as " girl 1 , " had been reported missing			1
an officer who then spoke to the same group of girls on february 5 gave them the letters addressed to their parents asking for further help from their daughters , the police statement said			1
but not all the letters were passed on			0
" with the benefit of hindsight , we acknowledge that the letters could have been delivered direct to the parents , " the police statement said			1
" however , the parents were already aware from the deputy head that girl 1 had been reported missing , all the teenagers were all being co-operative , they were all being treated as potential witnesses and there was nothing whatsoever to indicate that they themselves were planning to travel to @entity14			2
" what is @entity15 ' appeal for young people ? days before they left for @entity39 , at least one of the girls allegedly contacted a young woman , @entity232 , who left her home in @entity234 to travel to @entity14 in 2013 and is accused of trying to recruit others via social media			0
she has posted tips for girls and young women wanting to travel to @entity14 to marry jihadis , as she did			0
her blog also has links to advice posted by another jihad supporter , which recommends that those traveling to @entity14 seek to pack the essentials but not too much , since they may need to move often and at short notice , while remaining inconspicuous			0
