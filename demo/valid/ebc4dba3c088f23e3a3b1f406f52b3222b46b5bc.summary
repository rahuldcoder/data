as of tuesday evening , there were few clues			0
one of the aircraft 's data recorders , the so - called black boxes , has been found , according to @entity10 interior minister @entity74 , but it was too early to tell what it would say about the crash			1
" we do n't know much about the flight and the crash yet , " @entity5 chancellor @entity79 said			1

a @entity138 citizen and a @entity139 -- the latter a resident of @entity20 -- were among those on the flight , according to those countries ' foreign ministries			1
two @entity146 and two @entity147 were also believed to be on board			1
@entity9 started in 2002 and was taken over by @entity30 seven years later as its low - cost airline , handling an increasing number of midrange flights around @entity152			1
it was forced to cancel some flights tuesday because there were crews that did n't want to fly upon hearing news of the crash			0
the valley where the plane went down is long and snow - covered , and access is difficult , said the mayor of the nearby town of @entity164 , @entity165			1
it was well populated in the 19th century but there are almost no people living there now , he said			0
it 's an out - of - the - way place with magnificent scenery , he said			0
the sports hall of a local school has been freed up to take in bodies of the victims of the plane crash , said @entity177 from the town hall of @entity180 - les - @entity46 village			1
@entity180 - les - @entity46 is about 10 kilometers from the crash site			0
mountain guide @entity182 told @entity184 the crash was in the area of the @entity187 , where there are peaks of nearly 3,000 meters ( 1.9 miles )			0
it 's very snowy in the area and the weather is worsening , he said , which could complicate search and rescue efforts			0
responders may have to use skis to reach the crash site on the ground , he said			0
@entity199 , president of the tourism office at the @entity202 ski resort , said she heard the plane crash and called the police and the local government office to find out what had happened			1
" it was about 11 ( a.m. ) here			0
i was outside the garage , and we heard a strange noise , and at first we thought it was an avalanche , " she said			0
... we did n't know what			0
" a mountain guide who heard a plane fly at alarmingly low altitude shortly before the crash , @entity219 , said helicopters may be the only way to get to the crash site			2
according to the @entity224 , just under 16 % of aviation accidents occur during the cruise portion of a flight -- meaning after the climb and before descent			0
accidents are more common during takeoff and landing			0
the twin - engine @entity233 , which entered service in 1988 , is generally considered among the most reliable aircraft , aviation analyst @entity232 said			0
the captain of the crashed plane had flown for @entity9 for more than 10 years , and had more than 6,000 flight hours on this model of @entity8			1
the plane itself dates to 1991 and was last checked in @entity23 on monday , according to @entity107			2
so what happened ? @entity2 aviation analyst @entity244 said the plane 's speed is one clue			2
according to @entity9 , the plane reached its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet , and then dropped for eight minutes			1
the plane lost contact with @entity10 radar at a height of approximately 6,000 feet			1
this could indicate that there was not a stall , but that the pilot was still controlling the plane to some extent , @entity244 said			2
had there been an engine stall , the plane would have crashed in a matter of minutes , she said			1
that small piece of information about the descent means that the pilot could have been trying to make an emergency landing , or that the plane was gliding with the pilot 's guidance , @entity244 said			2
a scenario where the plane was gliding is potentially more dangerous because wide fields for landing would be hard to come by in the mountains , she said			2
the crash spurred officials in several countries to offer their condolences and pledge solidarity and cooperation to help those affected and determine what happened			0
" our thoughts and our prayers are with our friends in @entity152 , especially the people of @entity5 and @entity21 , following the terrible airplane crash in @entity12 , " @entity287 president @entity286 told reporters			1
" it 's particularly heartbreaking because it apparently includes the loss of so many children , some of them infants			0
" @entity5 's @entity79 said she was sending two ministers to @entity12 on tuesday and would travel to the crash site on wednesday to see it for herself			1
" we have to think of the victims and their families and their friends , " she said			2
@entity5 foreign minister @entity4 said the @entity5 government had set up a crisis center in response to the " terrible news " and was in close contact with the @entity10 authorities			1
" in these difficult hours , our thoughts are with those who have to fear that their close ones are among the passengers and crew , " he said			0
