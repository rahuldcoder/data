@entity0 suggested to @entity1 on wednesday that prisons can turn straight people gay			0
former @entity5 governor @entity4 called being gay a lifestyle choice , like drinking alcohol			0
i guess the next thing these two presumed 2016 presidential hopefuls will tell @entity13 is being black is a choice , too			0
like it or not , it 's no wonder @entity17 is emerging as the @entity19 's 2016 frontrunner			1
of course , there is that awkward little name thing , something he seems fully aware of -- despite only being in the exploratory phase of a potential campaign , @entity17 has already declared he 's not just another @entity17			1
" a lot of people know my dad , they know my brother			0
as in everybody 's family , we 're all a little different , " he reportedly told a crowd in @entity30 this week			0
and he seems to keep trying to distance himself from his family			0
" do you have brothers and sisters ? are you exactly the same ? " he insisted			0
yet @entity17 is banking hard on the same vault of donors and operatives his father @entity40 and his brother @entity41 used in their presidential campaigns			2
he 's already raising lots of money , asking donors recently not to give more than a still eye - popping $ 1 million to his super pac			0
" they did n't need to be persuaded , " @entity49 , a @entity19 fundraiser for @entity17 , told the @entity51			1
so , what exactly is in a name like @entity17 ? apparently , a whole lot of cash , which helps win presidential nominations and elections			2
and if @entity17 wins the nomination in 2016 , it will likely be less " joyfully , " as he promised last year , than ruthlessly			1
after all , we 're still more than 18 months from the election and @entity17 's locking in many of the same kinds of consultants that worked with his brother and father			1
" those who hold out can sense a distinct chill , " noted a recent @entity70 article			0
@entity17 's campaign is seeking to hire " donors , advisors and operatives , " wrote the @entity70 , with " deep connections to the @entity17 family 's past presidential campaigns and administrations			1
" those same family members from whom @entity17 swears he 's different ? and if consultants do n't abide by @entity17 's rules of loyalty and decide to work with other 2016 @entity19 aspirants ? " @entity87 rebuke follows , " the @entity70 notes , pointing to the example of @entity89 , a technology company that reportedly fell out of favor with the @entity17 campaign after one of the firm 's founders indicated @entity89 was hoping not to be tied to a single candidate			1
none of this is to suggest that @entity17 does n't have appeal as a candidate -- i like some of the things he did as @entity104 governor , like his record of cutting $ 19 billion in taxes and supporting school choice programs			1
( although i 'm not a fan of his willingness to grant illegal immigrants amnesty in any shape , fashion or form			0
) he seems more equipped to lead @entity13 and get things done than some others in the already cramped horse race like @entity118 gov. @entity117 , who seems more concerned with telling people off than sounding presidential			0
then there 's @entity121 and @entity4 , caring @entity123 men , but both too consumed with running for president of morality than bringing the entire country together after years of @entity128 supposedly dividing us on race , religion and sexuality			0
but what troubles me a little about @entity17 's early attempts at " corning the market " is that he 's relying on the same consultants that have cycled through the last 20 - plus years of elections -- some of whom worked for @entity142 's campaign			1
this raises the question of why , if @entity17 does n't want the public to view him as just another @entity17 running for president , he seems to be relying on the @entity17 network of consultants ? the same playbook that helped get his brother and father get elected president is n't going to work for this @entity17			1
the demographics of the country have changed , but it seems unlikely the @entity19 and its operatives have changed with it			2
the truth is that any @entity19 candidate who wins the nomination will have to refrain from business as usual			2
he ( let 's face it , the @entity19 wo n't nominate a woman ) will have to hire minorities and women in meaningful campaign positions and have a strategy to aggressively compete for minority votes			1
this is something @entity142 did n't do nearly enough of			0
@entity17 is only in the " pre-presidential " phase , ruminating over the idea			2
but he appears to be assembling a lot of the same old ( white ) faces of recent losing @entity19 campaigns we 've seen before			2
as a black conservative who would like to see a @entity19 in the @entity180 again , i hope @entity17 is n't @entity142 2.0 .			1
