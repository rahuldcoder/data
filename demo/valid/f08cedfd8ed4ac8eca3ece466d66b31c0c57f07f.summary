" the @entity88 is killing our innocent civilians but most of you already know that , " he wrote			2
" know you are fighting men who look into the barrel of your gun and see heaven , now how can you compete with that			0

he paused for four minutes , standing next to a tree in front of the @entity170			0
in front of him stood a line of children who were leaning over the barricade and watching the race			0
he put his backpack down at his feet and made a phone call			0
timeline of the bombings , manhunt and aftermath when his brother 's bomb went off a block away , heads swiveled in surprise in the direction of the noise			2
