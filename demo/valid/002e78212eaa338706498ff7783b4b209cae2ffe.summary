a bill that would allow @entity2 to use firing squads to execute some death - row prisoners passed in the @entity5 on tuesday			1
the measure , which passed 18 to 10 , will be sent to gov. @entity7 , who has not said whether he will sign it into law or veto the bill			0
@entity7 released a statement on the legislation , which would add death by firing squad as an option in a state that uses lethal injection			1
" our statute is clear that lethal injection is the method by which ( an execution ) will happen			1
we have no intent to change that , " he said			0
the law would give the state the option to use a five - member squad in cases where the drugs necessary for lethal injection are n't available 30 days before the date set for the execution			1
" our state , as is the case with states around the country , is finding it increasingly difficult to obtain the substances required to perform a lethal injection			1
we are dedicated to pursuing all reasonable and legal options to obtain those substances to make sure that , when required , we are in a position to carry out this very serious sentence by lethal injection , " the governor said			1
eight people are on @entity2 's death row			2
@entity2 banned death by firing squad in 2004 , though inmates who chose that option before the law changed still ended up being shot to death			1
the last execution by firing squad was in 2010 , and it was also the most recent execution in @entity2			2
a @entity2 firing squad also executed @entity58 in 1977 , the first death by capital punishment after the @entity56 @entity55 reinstated the death penalty the prior year			2
in recent years , states have struggled to maintain a supply of lethal injection drugs as manufacturers either stopped producing the drugs or barred their use in executions			1
@entity67 nearly out of execution drug the @entity70 manufacturers of pentobarbital , an anesthetic , explicitly banned @entity56 prisons from using its drug in executions			2
some states have sought out substitutes or gone with one drug instead of the traditional three - drug cocktail			0
in april , @entity80 used midazolam as a substitute for pentobarbital as part of a three - drug cocktail in an execution that went awry			0
@entity87 , a convicted rapist and murderer , writhed and convulsed after the drugs were administered			0
it took 43 minutes for him to die			0
last week , @entity91 postponed an execution because the drugs appeared " cloudy			0
" the state also indefinitely postponed at least one other execution until it can analyze the cocktail it uses for the procedures , officials said			0
@entity91 halts executions to analyze lethal drug cocktail @entity1 's @entity101 contributed to this report .			0

firing squads were an option in @entity2 before they were banned in 2004
new law would allow them as execution method if proper drugs not available for lethal injection
many states are having *problems* getting the drugs
