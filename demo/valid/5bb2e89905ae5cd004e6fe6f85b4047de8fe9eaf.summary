that was the good news			0
the disconcerting news was the doctor had to @entity13 the issue first to figure out the best medical advice			2
" my provider just did a web search to figure out what dose of hormones i should be on , and put me on the highest dose , " @entity3 said			0
that could have been a dangerous choice			0
" starting too high of a dose too quickly can cause a lot of health problems , particularly to cardiovascular health			0
" fortunately , @entity3 did n't have any health complications			2
but his experience left him with a mission			0
he volunteers to speak with medical institutions , as well as with businesses and colleges , to urge them to be more @entity34 inclusive			1

in general , legal protections and institutional supports for @entity55 are already thin , spotty or nonexistent			0
on march 2 , the @entity56 struck down @entity1 's ban on marriage for same - sex couples , but that ruling is on appeal			1

research shows that @entity34 individuals often experience health issues linked to being regular targets of discrimination or social stigma			2

if the available doctors are not familiar with the increased rates of these issues , they may provide inadequate care			2

the @entity159 's @entity158 named four @entity1 health care facilities , all in @entity0 , as leaders in @entity34 health care equality			1
@entity0 is on the state 's eastern border with @entity165			0

she recalled when she started working there in the late 1990s she saw medical staff refuse care to @entity34 people with hiv / aids			1
@entity92 deaths among african - americans drop 18 % , @entity190 says " we had nurses , for example , who said they would n't serve patients with hiv / aids , " @entity193 said			0
" but we 've come a long way since then			0
" @entity193 has seen more hospitals in the region adopting policies that are supportive of @entity34 residents , including one that just started recognizing same - sex partners ' wills as legal documents that will allow them access to their partners when they are being cared for in areas restricted to immediate family only			1
but she said she still sees too many @entity34 residents traveling great distances to get care and she still sees too many patients who do n't seek medical care until it is too late			1
" we still go to the hospital , " she said , " and see people who are days away from dying			0

for all but four of the days he was in the hospital , his partner , @entity237 , 36 , was at his side every evening			0
" @entity237 and i are a unit , " @entity224 said			0
" i can count on my fingers the number of times he did n't come			0
" while the couple has found the overwhelming majority of physicians and medical staff to be " genuinely supportive " of their relationship , there still were a few instances when they felt uncomfortable and unaccepted , once with a physician and another time with a nurse			0
" i 'm not sure how often the medical staff works with gay couples or receives training on how to work with gay couples , " @entity224 said			0
same - sex marriage fast facts @entity224 's prognosis is good , and the couple looks with optimism to a future of having more access to @entity34 - inclusive health care facilities and a more inclusive state overall			1
" hopefully , by the time we get through the cancer and save a little money , " @entity237 said , " @entity1 will follow most other states and allow our relationship to be legally recognized			0
