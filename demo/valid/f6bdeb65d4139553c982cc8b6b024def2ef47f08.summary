as a person - of - color , @entity1 , veteran minority journalist and longtime enthusiast of all things " @entity4 , " i am of course as happy , proud and thrilled as the wife of a successful @entity10 astronaut over the impending ascension of @entity12 , the biracial comedian from @entity13 , to @entity15 's anchor chair on what 's believed by many to be the most trusted half - hour of news and information in @entity20			1
as a person who believes in fair play and equal opportunity for all , i am also moved to wonder when a woman will get the chance to preside over a talk show after sunset ? look			1
i do n't mean to sound ungrateful			2
after generations of near - to - total invisibility on mass media airwaves , it 's bracing to find a whole one - hour block of high - profile cable television infotainment anchored by men who look like me			0
indeed , in pushing forth both @entity12 and @entity36 , the writer , comic and erstwhile national black correspondent for " @entity4 , " to preside over both halves of @entity40 's much - coveted 11 p.m. - to - midnight bloc , @entity15 is acknowledging what the mainstream of the country truly is : i.e. not as pale - faced as it once thought it was			1
and so far , @entity36 's " the @entity50 , " which premiered earlier this year as a replacement for the very different " @entity4 " companion once hosted by @entity53 , is gradually establishing its own identity as an equally cheeky hybrid of sketch satire and celebrity forum with its own multicultural flavor			2
still , one does wonder what happened to the groundswell of support building among " @entity4 " constituents for @entity59 , a three - year veteran of the show and an early favorite for @entity15 's spot after he announced last month he was leaving			1
@entity59 , who is black , tweeted back to her supporters her grateful opinion that she was " extremely under - qualified for the job			1
" maybe , but what about @entity67 ? she 's the " most senior correspondent " for " @entity4 " and is taking her penchant for performance artistry and provocation to @entity71 , where she 'll create her own satiric news franchise			1
her track record bodes well for her prospects there			0
but it 's difficult to find any evidence that she was considered a @entity15 successor -- though her announcement that she was leaving the show came a month after @entity15 's			0
besides bee ? no one , least of all those affiliated with @entity40 , have disclosed any candidates besides @entity12			2
there was even less buzz about the @entity15 opening than @entity53 's a year ago , during which time there were many willing to say that now was the time to finally give a woman a shot at late - night tv for the first time since the late @entity97 ' @entity96 effort , " @entity98 " came in 1987 -- and went in 1988			1
and yes , we are n't neglecting @entity100 , whose " @entity102 " was for seven seasons on the @entity103 network a bawdier late - night alternative to whatever @entity105 , @entity15 and others were putting down beyond prime - time			2
she 's supposed to start streaming a new show through @entity110 sometime next year			0
so one supposes she 's pretty busy			0
it will happen , perhaps sooner than one now expects			0
look how long it took before @entity113 and @entity114 were given their shots to anchor evening news broadcasts on @entity118 and @entity119 respectively			0
hmmm ... wonder what they 're doing after 11 p.m. these days .			0

as a black man , @entity123 thrilled @entity12 *tapped* for " @entity4 . " but in *service* of fair play he asks : why not a woman for the job ?
@entity59 , @entity67 would have been good candidates . when will women finally get their shot at late night ?
