latest developments : full story : @entity4 has launched military operations in neighboring @entity7 , where for months @entity9 rebels have intensified their violent campaign against the government , the @entity4 ambassador to the @entity5 told reporters in @entity13 on wednesday			1
@entity14 said the operation consisted of airstrikes on more than one city and in more than one region			0
@entity7 , a longtime stronghold for one of @entity21 's most dangerous branches , has been plunged into chaos since the @entity9 rebels began seizing control of the capital and other areas of the country in recent months			1
the unrest has led to the withdrawal of @entity5 special forces from @entity7 , seriously undermining counterterrorism efforts there			1
how did @entity7 get to this place ? " we are determined to protect the legitimate government of @entity7 , " @entity14 said			2
" having @entity7 fail can not be option for us or for our coalition partners			1
" a leading member of the @entity9 ' political wing , @entity39 , said force will be met with force			2
" this is a clear aggression and we will respond by a counteraggression , " @entity42 told @entity43			0
" the @entity4 move will unite all the people of @entity7 against the @entity4 and the kingdom will pay the price			1
" if the @entity4 try to invade with ground troops , he said , they will fail			2
" they probably will try to avoid that , but if it happened then they will pay a very high price , " @entity42 said			0
the @entity4 airstrikes appear to be targeting military compounds , headquarters and weapons storage areas			2
journalist @entity61 , who is staying in the capital of @entity65 , said hundreds of explosions have caused residents to stay in their homes			0
" i do expect the @entity65 of a couple of hours ago to be a different @entity65 in the morning , " he said			0
a senior @entity72 diplomat told @entity0 that the @entity73 soon will issue a statement that the @entity7 have asked for military assistance and the @entity73 is prepared to step in			1
it will be signed by all @entity73 countries except for @entity77			0
not all countries will contribute military forces , the source said			0
@entity72 and senior administration officials from the @entity5 told @entity0 that an interagency @entity5 coordination team is in @entity4			1
the sources said the @entity4 have not specified what they want yet , but will likely ask for @entity5 air support , satellite imagery , and other intelligence			1
" we can help with logistics and intelligence and things like that , but there will be no military intervention by the @entity5 , " a senior administration official said			0
@entity95 said the @entity5 is not involved in the airstrikes against the @entity9 , who are @entity98 in a majority @entity100 nation			2
but the coalition includes more than 10 nations , he said , meaning more than the six @entity73 countries will be involved			0
@entity7 , which has been in turmoil for months , shares a border with southern @entity4			1
" we hope that the wisdom will prevail among the @entity9 and they will become part of the political process rather than continue radical approach to try to take over @entity7 and destroy it , " @entity95 said			1
earlier wednesday , rebel forces captured parts of the port city of @entity114 and a nearby @entity7 air base recently evacuated by @entity5 forces , officials in the country said , with one rebel spokesman claiming that @entity7 's president fled @entity114 as his opponents advanced			2
the rebels late wednesday morning captured @entity124 air base , an installation that the last @entity7 - based contingent of @entity5 special operations forces evacuated over the weekend because of the deteriorating security situation in the country , said @entity129 , a spokesman for the @entity9 rebels			1
the rebel forces -- @entity9 and some allies in the @entity7 military -- then advanced on @entity114 , the nearby port city where president @entity134 had taken refuge for weeks			1
there were conflicting reports wednesday about @entity134 's whereabouts			0
but one @entity9 spokesman , @entity139 , said @entity134 left @entity114 on a boat with a @entity4 diplomatic team as the rebels approached the port city			1
@entity139 told @entity0 that @entity134 went to @entity144 , @entity4			1
but a @entity4 source told @entity0 's @entity146 that the president was still in @entity7 in the early hours thursday			1
earlier , @entity149 spokeswoman @entity148 told reporters , " it 's pretty clear ( @entity134 ) left voluntarily , " without saying where @entity134 had gone			0
she clarified that circumstances in @entity7 caused him to leave his residence , but that rebels did not expel him			2
two senior administration officials said it 's unclear if he left @entity114			0
the rebels ' advance illustrated the growing power the @entity9 have enjoyed since taking over @entity65 in january , and illustrated a further collapse of a government that had been a key @entity5 ally in the fight against then @entity7 - based @entity168			1
for years , @entity7 had allowed @entity5 drones and special operations forces to stalk @entity168 in the country			1
now , that arrangement is in tatters , along with any semblance of peace in the @entity177 nation			0
underscoring rebels ' increasing strength , @entity9 - commanded @entity7 air force jets on wednesday dropped bombs on or fired missiles at the presidential palace in @entity114 for the third time in a week , causing minimal damage and injuring no one , two @entity134 aides said			1
the airstrikes happened before reports of @entity134 's departure from @entity114 emerged			0
@entity134 had been staying at the @entity114 palace since last month , when he fled the capital , @entity65 , after a @entity9 takeover there			0
the @entity5 " strongly condemn ( s ) the recent offensive military actions taken in @entity7 that have targeted president @entity134 , " @entity148 told reporters wednesday			2
the @entity9 militants -- @entity98 who have long felt marginalized in the majority @entity100 country -- moved into the capital , @entity65 , in september , sparking battles that killed a few hundred people before a ceasefire was called			2
in january , they surrounded the presidential palace and @entity134 resigned and was put under house arrest			0
but @entity134 escaped in february , fleeing to @entity114 and declaring that he remained the country 's leader			0
the @entity9 took control of military forces stationed near @entity65 , including the air force			2
some of the forces aligned with the @entity9 also are loyal to @entity134 's predecessor , former president @entity211 , who resigned in 2012 after months of " @entity216 " protests inspired in part by a 2011 revolution in @entity215			1
by last week , opposing @entity7 military forces -- those loyal to the @entity9 , and those answering to @entity134 -- battled in @entity114 , with @entity134 's forces temporarily pushing out the rebels on march 19 after at least 13 people were killed			1
on wednesday , with the @entity5 forces gone , @entity9 - aligned forces took over @entity124 air base , about 40 kilometers from @entity114 , said @entity129 , one of the @entity9 spokesmen			2
the number of casualties , if any , was n't immediately available			0
some @entity134 supporters evacuated the base , and @entity9 forces arrested some top officials who were there , including @entity134 's defense minister , @entity129 said			0
no deaths or injuries were immediately reported in the rebels ' subsequent takeover of @entity114 's airport and the central bank			0
@entity0 's @entity248 , @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 , @entity245 , @entity246 and @entity247 contributed to this report .			0
