new figures indicate that about 11 million people have signed up for health insurance during this latest sign - up period of @entity5 , of which about half will be from the uninsured population , based on previous estimates			1
once again , the supporters of the law celebrate with proclamations that " it 's working			0
" one could say that assessment is true , if the definition of " working " means enrolling people into anything called health insurance			0
to be sure , the law 's implementation is progressing , but there is no cause for celebration			0
it is indeed true that millions of @entity26 are now newly enrolled into health insurance , but it is disingenuous to tout this as a great success			0
an estimated 71 % of the new insurance arises through @entity32 , using 2014 calculations based on analysis by @entity35 and @entity36 of data from the @entity38 and @entity39			1
the harsh reality awaiting these low - income @entity26 is undeniable : according to 2013 data from a 2014 @entity45 study , 55 % of doctors already refuse new @entity32 patients			1
according to the @entity47 , 2008 , the percentage of doctors that refuse new @entity32 patients dwarf by about 8 to 10 times the percentage that refuses new private insurance patients			1
such " insurance " from @entity5 not only fails to provide access to doctors , but research in the top medical journals such as @entity56 , @entity57 , journal of @entity59 and @entity60 and @entity61 , show that @entity32 beneficiaries suffer worse outcomes than similar patients with private insurance ... all at an added cost of another $ 800 billion by @entity67 estimates to taxpayers after the decade			1
it is not hyperbole to call @entity32 a disgrace at its annual cost of about $ 450 billion , and expanding it rather than helping poor people buy private insurance is simply inexplicable			1
health care access for middle - class @entity26 is also significantly worsened by @entity5 's private insurance decrees			1
the law already forced termination of health insurance for millions of @entity26 estimated as 4.7 million by the @entity81 -- insurance they personally had chosen to buy			0
the @entity67 now projects that a stunning 10 million @entity26 will be forced off their chosen employer - based health insurance by 2021 -- a tenfold increase in the number that was initially projected back in 2011 , at the onset of the law			2
along with that forced change of coverage , many suddenly find themselves without access to their chosen doctors			1
despite the assertion that the law increases insurance choices , the @entity5 exchanges do quite the opposite for those dependent on them and their government 's subsidies			1
@entity99 reported 68 % of @entity5 insurance options only cover narrow or very narrow provider networks , double that of the previous year			2
for cancer care , the majority of @entity26 's best hospitals in the @entity104 are not covered in most of their states ' exchange plans			0
the " narrow network " strategy is about to hit even more @entity26 in 2015 , as @entity5 exchanges from @entity111 to @entity112 further restrict access to top doctors and hospitals in an attempt to quell insurance premium increases caused by the law itself , according to an analysis by the @entity120			1
and a study in late 2014 commissioned by the prestigious @entity122 determined that the specialists essential to diagnose and treat stroke , one of the most disabling and lethal diseases in the @entity26 , are in severe shortage under @entity5 insurance exchange plans			2
indeed , unless one has the financial resources or power to skirt the new system , many of @entity26 's top doctors and hospitals are no longer available			0
@entity5 has forced @entity26 onto a far more government - dominated health care pathway than in the past			1
coupled with population aging , the 107 million under the government 's @entity32 or @entity39 insurance in 2013 will rapidly increase to 135 million just five years later , a growth rate tripling that of private insurance			2
by the end of the decade , a full 140 million @entity26 will have their health care access directly controlled by government insurance , according to the @entity146			0
more doctors than ever already refuse @entity32 and @entity39 due to inadequate payments for care , and that will only accelerate as government lowers reimbursements			1
less appreciated is that inadequate payments to doctors by government insurance substantially increase private insurance premiums			0
back in 2008 , a shortfall of over $ 88 billion of payment from @entity32 and @entity39 beneficiaries added more than $ 1,500 extra per year in premiums and $ 1,800 extra in total out - of - pocket costs to every family of four with private insurance			1
as the government increases its role as insurer , it increases its hold on payments to doctors and hospitals , so it will be able to reduce reimbursements and dictate access to limited networks of doctors and hospitals			1
and with increasing enrollment into government insurance , private premiums will undoubtedly rise even more			0
it is therefore absolutely critical for the new @entity181 to reject @entity5 and instead help individual @entity26 and their families , particularly middle class and poor @entity26 -- the people most harmed by @entity5			2
any legitimate health reform plan must be focused on three goals : 1 ) help consumers find affordable private insurance suited to their personal needs ; 2 ) liberate the poor from @entity32 so they have actual access to medical care , as well as the dignity of personal choice of doctor ; and 3 ) add substantive mechanisms that reduce health care costs by competition and value - seeking by consumers			1
the plan should not replicate the false claims of @entity5 supporters that recent slowdowns in health spending from economic downturns were somehow caused by @entity5			2
the @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , and @entity210 put forth this month by leading @entity211 in @entity181 tries to do just that			0
this bill , also known as @entity214 , represents a serious plan to expand access to health care and reduce the nation 's health care expenses			0
the @entity214 proposal incentivizes people to buy insurance they value , and it generates affordable options , instead of forcing the purchase of expensive insurance that individuals do n't want			0
current harmful barriers to interstate cooperation and anti-competitive impediments are reduced			0
health savings plans are liberalized to allow everyone , not just the affluent , control over their health care dollar			0
medicaid reforms provide options for individuals to buy private coverage , and the government provides significant financial support for lower income @entity26			0
and no one is forced to spend their hard - earned money on something they do not want			0
as the @entity245 hears arguments wednesday about the legitimacy of subsidies under the @entity5 , @entity26 must recognize the bigger picture about @entity26 health reform			2
contrary to the mantra that the @entity211 has no plan other than to repeal @entity5 , the truth is that it is the supporters of @entity5 are the ones who are single - minded			1
they are focused on maintaining the @entity5 without regard for legitimate reforms to improve health care access and quality and without finally addressing what always was the most important problem with @entity26 health care -- its cost			1
responsible leadership must focus on empowering patients instead of the government , before private health insurance and with that access to the excellence of @entity26 's medical system are eliminated for all but the affluent			2
empowering individuals -- regardless of socioeconomic status -- with choices and information in order to facilitate access to care from the best doctors and hospitals in the world should be the thrust of any change to @entity26 health care			2
that 's an @entity26 solution , and it 's up to our elected officials to make sure it finally happens .			0

@entity290 : nearly three - *quarters* of those insured under @entity5 were added to @entity32
access to the best doctors is very limited ; patients often have little choice of doctors , he says
