many years ago , a colleague told me how frustrated her husband was by " @entity4 , " a special membership program offered by the retail giant that provides discounts , recommendations and other information to help parents during the crazy toddler years			1
in bold print , the company says the program is " open to anyone , whether you 're a mom , dad , grandparent , or caretaker			2
" but still it is called " @entity4 , " irking my colleague 's husband to no end since he was the one ordering the majority of diapers and other products for their babies			1
' @entity28 ' gets a makeover in @entity31 ads my friend 's husband was not alone			0
a petition created a few years ago calls on @entity35 to change the name of the program from " @entity4 " to " @entity38			1
" but the drive did n't get much traction			0
that changed after the recent death of a beloved dad blogger , @entity43 , who created a @entity45 group for dad bloggers in 2012 that has grown to more than 1,000 members			1
in 2013 , @entity43 called on men and women to sign the petition to get @entity35 to change the name of the program			1
" why did @entity35 bother changing the name of its parenting program when the program started in the @entity55 ? what made them realize they could n't get away with calling it ' @entity4 , ' and why do they get away with it here ? " @entity43 wrote			1
" someone actually started a petition to change the name to ' @entity38 ' in the @entity65 , and so far it has less than 100 signatures			1
why is that ? why are we ok with letting @entity69 be more progressive than we are here when it comes to fatherhood ? they have a queen ! they are ruled by a freakin ' queen ! we can do better than that ! " he wrote			0
no more dumb old dad : changing the bumbling father stereotype i had the pleasure of interviewing @entity43 for a story last year on whether modern dads get enough credit			2
the 42 - year - old stay - at - home father of two , who fought perceptions of fathers as nothing more than babysitters in essays on his blog , was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2014			0
@entity43 , of @entity94 , @entity95 , died saturday			0
now , members of the dad blogging community are rallying in his honor , trying to step up the pressure on the internet powerhouse to finally change the name of its program and get with the times			2
@entity105 , a stay - at - home father of two in @entity107 and founder of the blog at - @entity110 , never got to meet @entity43 but says that when @entity43 welcomed him into his community of dad bloggers , it changed his life			0
" he got me writing again , inspired me to publish , to contribute , to tell my story ... to be a better dad for my daughters			0
" @entity105 , like several other dad bloggers , took to @entity119 using the # @entity121 hashtag to call for @entity35 to make the change			2
" the push for inclusivity in the parenting arena has been well received by many a brand in the past few years and , like @entity43 , many of us think the change to ' @entity38 ' is a no - brainer , " @entity105 said			1
@entity132 moms and dads face off in hit ad @entity135 , a father of two in @entity137 , @entity138 , and founder of the blog @entity141 , points out how @entity35 calls its program " @entity38 " in @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 as well as the @entity55			1
" so why is it called ' @entity4 ' in @entity65 ? " @entity135 wrote in a blog post			2
" we are continuing a cause that was once championed by the creator of the @entity45 group , @entity43 , " wrote @entity135			0
" in his name , we want to finish the job			0
" the petition has gotten over 4,800 signatures			1
@entity35 has not commented on the movement			0
in the meantime , @entity43 's supporters wo n't stop pushing			0
i hope they never do			0
