and on giant game boards			1
it 's used chocolate and featured real money			2
there have been games that barely lasted the night and marathon contests that went on for weeks			0
not bad for a game that , according to lore , maker @entity19 originally rejected for containing " 52 fundamental errors			2
" march 19 marks the official 80th anniversary of the world 's best - selling board game , now manufactured by @entity25			1
its circuitous history , like its game board , has been filled with several interesting turns			1
here are a few : legend has it that @entity32 , an unemployed salesman , invented the game in his kitchen in 1930			2
but the roots of @entity3 actually date back a few more decades , to a game called the @entity37 created by @entity38 in 1903			1
the @entity37 was meant to be educational , illustrating economist @entity40 's belief -- inspired by the @entity41 -- that property ownership by individuals is inherently unfair			2
@entity38 's game was an underground success , leading to a number of offshoots , including the one that @entity32 tweaked			2
@entity19 bought her patent for $ 500 in 1935 , closing the loop			0
as for @entity32 , he was inspired in 1932 by a version created by a @entity55 @entity54 community that made @entity56 the locale of the game			1
@entity32 added colors and other design elements -- " a look and feel to his board that would prove immensely appealing , " writes @entity64 in " @entity3 , " a 2006 history of the game			1
@entity32 's game was initially rejected by @entity19 for three errors -- not 52 -- but when his independent sales took off , @entity19 bought the game from him			2
the date ? march 19 , 1935			0
@entity3 has been translated into 47 languages			1
it 's played in 114 countries			0
it 's sold more than 275 million copies			0
@entity25 prints $ 30 billion in @entity3 money each year , and well more than $ 3 trillion has been printed since 1935			1
not bad considering each standard game comes with $ 20,580 -- though it 's in the rules that the bank can never go broke , so make up some scrip if you need it			1
incidentally , the @entity83 -- named @entity83 -- was likely based on mustachioed financier @entity84			0
even before numerous editions of @entity3 were widely licensed , there were local board variations depending on the country			1
@entity3 , for example , is @entity90 in @entity91 , @entity92 in @entity93 , @entity94 in the @entity95 and @entity96 in @entity97 , after major streets in @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102			1
other streets have also drawn from local geography			2
the new " @entity109 " @entity108 edition , however , opened the voting to enthusiasts -- and @entity112 ( population 14,000 ) , the capital of @entity106 , won pride of place as @entity3			1
( @entity116 , @entity117 , won the @entity118			0
) @entity112 was one of 60 cities in the running , mayor @entity121 said , and was " in the bottom of the pack " when she was informed of the contest			0
being a competitive sort , she was determined to push @entity112 past perhaps more logical cities such as @entity127 or @entity128			0
" it 's our energy and the fact we engaged our citizens , " she told @entity0			0
" i was doing radio and press releases and working with our school district , and our @entity136 utilized social media			0
it became a big deal here			0
" one consideration for visitors : @entity112 is on the @entity142 , but it lacks a literal boardwalk			0
) still , given the city 's triumph , you probably would n't want to play @entity3 against an energized @entity112 resident			1
@entity112 may be doing better than @entity56 , which has struggled since the mid- 2000s to return to its gambling heyday			0
still , the @entity55 resort does have @entity3 to thank for some of its fame -- not that it was appreciated at one time			1
in the early ' 70s , a city commissioner proposed renaming @entity158 and @entity159 avenues , since both had other names in different parts of town			2
the idea caused an uproar among @entity3 fans and the idea was eventually shot down			1
" @entity159 and @entity158 are the streets we know , " wrote one commissioner			2
" without them , we could never pass @entity3			1
" do you put money from @entity174 and @entity175 in the center of the board and collect it when landing on @entity178 ? not in the rules			1
do you give $ 400 for landing on @entity3 instead of $ 200 ? not in the rules			1
do you allow secret side deals ? uh - uh			0
( admittedly , there is now a set of " @entity184 " that allow for variations , but they 're not official			0
) the dismissive line " @entity188 , do not collect $ 200 , " which has worked its way into a few songs , is from @entity3			1
and the game also gave us the term " monopoly money , " as in worthless currency			2
there are n't many movies featuring the game , but " @entity203 " has a famous scene with @entity200 and @entity201 arguing over @entity201 's play			1
stay tuned , though : a @entity3 movie is back on after several years in @entity206 purgatory			1
so forget the classic definition of " monopoly money			0
" @entity25 has taken quite a bunch to the bank			0
the original set featured a top hat , iron , shoe , thimble , battleship and cannon			0
over the years , some pieces have been retired -- including a purse , rocking horse and lantern -- and others have been added			0
the latest ? a bag of money and a cat			0
and they 're all still made of metal , just as they 've been for decades			2
want to win at @entity3 ? though there 's some chance involved ( pardon the pun ) , the low - rent light blues and the mid-market oranges are the most desirable , according to a study done for @entity235 's 1974 " the @entity234			1
" the oranges and reds are the most likely to be landed on			0
the more upscale greens will pay off eventually , but they 're expensive to develop , so you 'd better have another form of cash flow in the short term			0
or you could just do what millions have done since @entity32 's day : land on someone else 's hotel , get mad and turn over the game board			1
hey , it worked in college .			0
