a lawsuit that 's stirring concern among drinkers of some @entity4 wine starts with a history lesson			1
the deaths of @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and other prominent figures have been attributed to arsenic poisoning , the first paragraph of the 30 - page complaint says			1
and , now , drinkers of some @entity4 wine have become " unwitting ' guinea pigs ' of arsenic exposure , " thanks to the negligent and misleading actions of dozens of @entity4 wineries , according to the class action complaint filed march 19 on behalf of two @entity4 couples			1
the lawsuit does not include any allegations of physical injury or death due to arsenic consumption associated with drinking the wines named in the complaint			1
the plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages and a court order requiring the defendants disclose on the bottles the risks of consuming inorganic arsenic in wines and engage in " corrective advertising " regarding their conduct			1
news of the lawsuit , which broke last week , struck fear in the hearts of frugal wine consumers nationwide , prompting many to share lists on social media of labels named in the lawsuit , all but declaring the outcome a foregone conclusion			2
the complaint names 28 companies that represent 83 low - cost labels familiar to supermarket wine aisle shoppers : cupcake , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 , among others			2
even the maker of @entity64 's @entity63 ( affectionately known among fans as " two - buck @entity66 " ) , was called out for allegedly failing to warn consumers that it contained " dangerously " high levels of inorganic arsenic			1
but should consumers start looking to other winemakers or other wine - producing states for gallon - sized bottles of zinfandel ? or is the lawsuit a fearmongering tactic being used to drum up business for the beverage - testing company used for the lawsuit , as some defendants and industry insiders have insinuated ? most of the defendants said their wine was safe to drink when contacted by @entity5			1
some declined to comment , citing the pending litigation			0
others referred @entity5 to the @entity87 , a @entity4 trade group that called the claims " false and misleading			1
" " we are concerned that the irresponsible publicity campaign by the litigating party could scare the public into thinking that wine is not safe to consume , which is patently untrue , " said the group , which represents 1,000 @entity4 wineries , including 10 of the defendants			1
the lawsuit alleges that three separate labs " skilled in arsenic testing " independently confirmed that the defendants produce wines containing " dangerously " high levels of inorganic arsenic , in some cases up to 500 % more than what is considered acceptable			1
" put differently , " the complaint states in bold letters , " just a glass or two of these arsenic - contaminated wines a day over time could result in dangerous arsenic toxicity to the consumer			1
" a spokesman from the public relations firm representing the plaintiffs and @entity115 , which performed the analysis , said the company is confident that its data is " based on sound scientific research			0
" because the company expects testing methodology to be at issue in litigation , it declined to reveal specific data or testing methods			0
" we understand the public interest in this story and look forward to resolving the litigation to make these products safer for consumers			0
and we hope the winemakers will take these findings just as seriously and work to make sure their wines are safe , " spokesman @entity132 said			1
without seeing the lab results , experts suggest reserving judgment based on the following issues to arise from the lawsuit : arsenic is found in air , soil and water throughout the world			1
therefore , it can also found in grains , fruits , vegetables and seafood due to absorption through soil and water			0
" plants take up trace amounts of arsenic from the soil , and we have been ingesting these trace amounts for all of human history			1
generally , these amounts are at levels well below that associated with either acute or chronic toxicity , " said @entity161 's @entity160 , director of undergraduate studies for the viticulture and enology program in the @entity165			1
@entity141 occurs in inorganic and organic forms			1
the @entity171 describes organic or naturally occurring arsenic as " essentially harmless			2
" inorganic arsenic has been classified as a human carcinogen by the @entity175			2
the first time the @entity171 set limits for arsenic levels in food or drink was in 2013 , when it proposed to limit the amount of inorganic arsenic in apple juice to 10 parts per billion			1
long - term exposure to inorganic arsenic , mainly through smoking , drinking contaminated water , eating food prepared with contaminated water or eating food irrigated with arsenic - rich water , can lead to health risks such as cancer and skin lesions			2
according to the lawsuit , inorganic arsenic makes up the " overwhelming majority " of arsenic in wines at issue , despite the winemakers ' ability to limit inorganic arsenic through " responsible winemaking procedures " and " sophisticated testing equipment			1
" without providing specific data , the plaintiffs said their analysis found inorganic arsenic " far in excess " of what 's allowed in drinking water based on the @entity175 's standard for arsenic in drinking water : 10 parts per billion			2
but the @entity175 limit for water is based on total arsenic , including both organic and inorganic forms , leading some to question whether it 's the best basis for comparison			2
this standard is set to protect consumers served by public water systems from the effects of long - term , chronic exposure to arsenic , @entity175 spokeswoman @entity221 said in an email			2
it 's based on how much water people typically drink daily , which ranges from one to two liters , she said			0
however , the @entity175 standard for arsenic in drinking water " is of limited use when considering any potential health risks related to arsenic in wine , " @entity171 spokeswoman @entity231 said in an email to @entity5			2
" people drink far more water than they do wine over their lifetimes , and they start drinking water earlier in life			0
thus , both the amount and period of exposure are different and would require separate analyses , " she said			0
seeing as the @entity255 recommends drinking about 10 cups of water a day and no more than two alcoholic drinks ( about 1 cup of wine ) a day , " a sensible concentration limit for arsenic in wine should be at least 10-fold higher than for drinking water , and possibly higher , since we also use water for cooking and cleaning , " @entity250 of @entity161 said			0
this is roughly the case in countries that have established limits for arsenic in wine , which leads to the next point : the @entity269 @entity268 regulates the production of alcoholic beverages , and part of this process is testing wine for arsenic , said @entity276 , spokeswoman for @entity279 's @entity278 school			0
even though the @entity171 has not established a standard for acceptable levels of arsenic in wine , @entity4 wine exports are tested and found to be below the established limits for export , @entity276 said in an email			1
countries that import @entity4 wine also test for arsenic using their own standards : 100 parts per billion in @entity294 and 200 parts per billion in @entity296 -- 10 to 20 times higher than the drinking water limit in the @entity269			1
" it 's certainly appropriate to look to other countries ' regulations for guidance , " @entity160 said			0
" their regulators are presumably looking at the same body of research that @entity269 regulators would look to if they were to establish a mandatory limit for wine			0
" the day @entity311 aired a segment on the lawsuit , the company that performed the analysis sent out a news release offering its services to provide " reassurance from arsenic in wine " through " a tool for screening their offerings to ensure the quality of their supply chain			2
" neither @entity115 nor its ceo , @entity325 , is a party to the lawsuit			0
but @entity325 ' appearance in the segment prompted detractors to cry conflict of interest			0
in a statement to @entity5 , @entity325 said it was concerning that some winemakers would point to this as a conflict of interest " instead of focusing on making sure their product contains the lowest amount of contaminants possible			0
" he also defended his company 's right to offer its services to retailers , saying he will continue to do so			0
" the arsenic data in my testing is based on years of scientific research and operating a commercial chemistry lab for over two years			0
as a commercial lab no one should be surprised that @entity115 has been offering lab testing services to the alcohol beverage industry since july 2013			0
" a previous version of this story incorrectly stated that the brand barefoot was a named defendant in the lawsuit			0
this story has been corrected			0
@entity5 sincerely regrets the error .			0

a class - action lawsuit alleges some @entity4 wines contain unsafe levels of arsenic
winemakers respond that their wines are safe and the suit amounts to fearmongering
@entity141 can be dangerous in high concentrations
