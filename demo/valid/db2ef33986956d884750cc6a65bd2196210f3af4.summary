@entity5 president @entity4 's effort to bridge the trust deficit between african - americans and law enforcement , the money wars heading into 2016 , a little @entity1 history and a " do not reply " mandate fill our sunday trip around the " @entity14 " table : 1			1
winning @entity1 once meant little , but are @entity16 's multiple wins just the ticket ? @entity16 won his third consecutive @entity1 presidential straw poll this weekend , and most political journalists yawned -- and understandably so			1
there have been 20 previous @entity1 straw polls , and only in four of those cases has the winner ended up as the @entity25 presidential nominee			0
and in all four of those cases , it was in the actual election year			1
never has a winner in the year before the presidential vote -- like this year -- gone on to win the nomination			2
so sen. @entity16 should n't rush to measure the @entity33 drapes			1
but he is now in special company : he 's in a tie for @entity1 wins ( three ) with @entity37 and @entity38			2
@entity39 is the all - time leader with four @entity1 wins			0
so winning once is more or less meaningless , but winning twice or more ? the @entity42 -- @entity16 and @entity41 -- are the only two men with at least two @entity1 wins who have not appeared on the @entity25 ticket			1
( @entity38 was @entity47 's vp nominee			2
) it 's one more way , we can assume , that @entity16 hopes to get some separation from his dad heading into 2016			1
@entity52 hopes for action -- and legacy item -- in law enforcement arena @entity5 will be consumed this week with prime minister @entity57 's speech to @entity58 and the continuing fight over funding the @entity60			1
but @entity61 of the @entity62 took us inside another big event : a report from the task force @entity4 established @entity67 to study the tensions between law enforcement and @entity70			1
" the @entity33 has said that they have been surprised by so many areas of commonality between these activists and law enforcement officials who were on this task force , " said @entity71			0
" other people say the gulf is as wide as you might imagine			0
" @entity71 adds that the president does n't want this report to gather dust on the shelf but casts doubts over whether this will be part of @entity4 's record			1
" whether or not it will be a legacy item , we 'll have to see			2
that will probably depend on legislation , and that seems fairly unlikely			0
the super @entity93 campaign : millions are ok , but billions rule there is always a money race in presidential politics			1
but the times are changing			0
candidates need to raise cash for their actual campaign committees , but that effort is taking a back seat to the bigger money chase			2
@entity106 of the @entity107 shared some reporting on the race to win over big -- as in billionaire -- support for the super pacs that now dominate the world of political finance			2
@entity106 noted it 's march 1 , and " not a single candidate has set up an actual campaign committee			2
" " they have , though , set up super pacs , and this has dramatically changed politics			2
the donors most coveted now are billionaires with a ' b , ' those [ who ] can stroke seven - , eight - figure checks and the year of the bundlers who can raise a few hundred thousand dollars is seemingly passe			0
@entity130 : the states are blue , but the money chase is bipartisan it 's not really a risk to say @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity5 will go blue -- @entity137 -- in the 2016 presidential race			1
so why , then , are many @entity25 hopefuls heading @entity140 , especially to @entity141 ? it 's all about the cash			1
@entity4 dominated high - tech fundraising in 2008 and 2012			1
@entity146 's @entity145 traveled @entity147 recently as @entity148 made a pitch for help this time around			1
she reports that @entity151 has many friends , but that there is a fierce and bipartisan competition for money out @entity140			0
" this time she 'll ... have competition from an unlikely source , @entity16 , who 's opened an office there			1
he 's hoping to tap into the libertarian vein of some of the @entity141 money			1
@entity164 has also been meeting with tech executives			2
" " it 's not clear who 's going capture this new and growing source of wealth for elections that are supposed to cost over $ 1 billion on each side , but one thing 's sure			0
we 'll see lots of candidates and staffers making many trips down the 101			0
do not reply : your government 's guide to a partial shutdown a temporary fix keeps the @entity60 running at full steam this week , but @entity58 will be trying to find a longer - term solution next			0
so department workers still have to prepare and sort out whether they would have to work -- or would be furloughed -- in the event funding expires			0
@entity188 of the @entity62 gave us a glimpse at the contingency planning , obtaining a memo sent to relevant workers as it appeared @entity58 might not reach even a temporary deal before the friday night deadline			0
" buried deep in there on page 23 --- a little note to the 15 % of @entity60 workers who might have been furloughed : you can check your email but you can not hit reply , " said @entity188			0
" you were allowed to check for the status of the furlough but to hit reply or to engage anyone on email might result in severe penalties			0
" " so you would get paid after a shutdown , but you were n't allowed to check your email			0
perhaps a silver lining to the possibility of the shutdown			0

could president @entity4 's legacy *include* fixing @entity215 ?
@entity16 , @entity164 and @entity148 compete for @entity141 cash
will 2016 be the year of the super @entity93 election ?
