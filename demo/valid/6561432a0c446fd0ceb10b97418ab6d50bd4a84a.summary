@entity0 military advisers are training @entity4 troops in @entity4 , the @entity0 said thursday , as part of efforts to support the government in @entity8 as it combats @entity10 separatists in the east			1
prime minister @entity12 announced last month that @entity0 would send military advisers to @entity4 and provide an additional 15 million pounds ( $ 22.3 million ) in humanitarian aid			1
an uneasy truce has been in place since last month between the @entity4 forces and @entity10 separatists in @entity4 's eastern @entity19 and @entity20 regions			0
last month , @entity0 defence secretary @entity21 told @entity22 that @entity0 was " providing additional nonlethal support " in the form of advisory and training teams			2
" this support , provided at the request of the @entity4 government , will help their armed forces develop and maintain the capacity and resilience they need , and help reduce fatalities and casualties , " @entity27 said			0
the @entity38 , which has been monitoring the ceasefire , said wednesday that its observers had witnessed continued fighting in areas around @entity19 airport and @entity44 , east of the port city of @entity46			0
@entity50 spokesman @entity49 said the presence of foreign military instructors in @entity4 did nothing to reduce tensions , @entity48 state news agency @entity47 reported			2
" obviously , this is not helping in the building of trust or in easing the tensions in the conflict			0
it can be simply said that this is not aiding in the settlement , that 's a fact , " @entity49 is quoted as saying			0
the @entity63 has promised to support an upcoming training program for @entity4 's @entity66 forces			0

@entity90 secretary general @entity89 condemned the " so - called treaty on alliance and integration " in a statement wednesday , and repeated @entity90 's call for @entity48 to reverse its recognition of the territories as independent states and to withdraw its forces from @entity81 soil			1
" this so - called treaty is yet another move by the @entity48 that hampers ongoing efforts by the international community to strengthen security and stability in the region , " he said			1
" it violates @entity81 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , and blatantly contradicts the principles of international law , @entity38 principles and @entity48 's international commitments			1
" it does not contribute to a peaceful and lasting settlement of the situation in @entity81			0
" @entity2 's @entity116 and @entity117 contributed to this report .			0
