@entity0 the bodies of four @entity4 tourists slain in a terror attack on @entity7 's @entity6 three days ago arrived back in @entity4 on saturday , an official with the @entity9 told @entity1 , but 14 victims ' remains still lie in the morgue			1
as @entity7 gets back on its feet , the investigation into wednesday 's shooting at the @entity0 landmark continues			1
most of the 23 victims were foreigners , making the process of identification more complicated			1
nineteen of them were tourists who 'd been on two cruise ships that docked in @entity0			1
@entity30 , @entity25 , @entity4 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 citizens are among those to have been formally identified so far			1
the bodies of the @entity4 were met in @entity32 by @entity4 prime minister @entity33 , who paid his respects to the victims and their families in a brief ceremony			1
eleven people who were injured in the attack remained in the hospital in @entity7 on saturday , the official at the @entity9 said			2
@entity7 prime minister @entity42 identified two suspects in the attack , @entity45 and @entity46 , in an interview with @entity30 radio station @entity48 on thursday , though it was n't immediately clear if they were the pair killed at the museum by @entity7 security forces			1
he said @entity45 was " known to the security services , he was flagged and monitored , " but not known or being followed for anything special			2
authorities have arrested nine people in connection with the attack , including four directly linked to it , according to a statement from @entity7 president @entity62			2
an uncle of @entity45 , @entity64 , told @entity1 on friday that no one he knew had seen any signs of extremism in his 26 - year - old nephew			1
but he said @entity45 was one of the two gunmen killed at the museum			1
" it 's true that @entity45 carried out this terrorist attack , he was killed ; his head , his body , we do n't have it back , " he said			1
but , he said , he believed @entity45 and other young tunisians like him were also victims of terrorism -- of the recruiters who paid them money , organized the logistics and took them to places like @entity84 and @entity85 to train as fighters			2
he had known his nephew well , he said			2
" after the revolution of 2011 he started to pray , before he would drink beers from time to time , like a young @entity7			2
he was n't extreme in any way			2
" the only thing that raised questions was that @entity45 had disappeared for about a month , he said			2
although his nephew said he 'd gone to the @entity7 city of @entity95 to work , his family now suspected he had been in @entity85 because of the phone numbers he called from			1
" when he came back his behavior was the same : he was still himself , calm , serious			0
nobody noticed anything , even the neighbors i spoke to , " said @entity64			0
" he said hello to everyone , he prayed , he took his coffee , even on the day of the attack he took his coffee with his family and went to work			0
" @entity64 said @entity45 's father , sister and brother had undergone lengthy interrogations by anti-terror police since the attack			0
officers had seized his nephew 's computer and phone , as well as taking samples of his fingerprints , he said			0
a cousin of @entity45 , who asked not to be named , told @entity1 that the family was shocked by what had happened			1
" we are all shocked , we lost someone even if what he did was wrong , may @entity124 forgive him			0
those he killed were innocent , why would you go and harm @entity128 or @entity27 ... our @entity125 does n't mention about killing people , @entity125 has never been this , " he said			1
he also said he had no idea how his cousin had been radicalized , saying he was " a normal @entity7 guy ... but not an extremist			1
" security minister @entity134 said on friday that the two extremists who attacked the museum got weapons training at camps in @entity85			0
the suspects were activated from sleeper cells in @entity7 , he said			0
he did not say which group activated them , or with whom they trained			0
" they left the country illegally last december for @entity85 , and they were able to train with weapons there , " he told private broadcaster @entity143			0
like @entity7 , @entity85 saw its longtime leader @entity150 ousted during the regional wave of revolutions known as the @entity153			0
but unlike its neighbor to the west , @entity85 has been fraught with more instability and violence -- much of it perpetrated by @entity159 militants			0
in an audio message posted online thursday , @entity160 claimed responsibility for wednesday 's attack , which it said targeted " crusaders and apostates " with " automatic weapons and hand grenades			0
" @entity1 can not independently verify the legitimacy of the audio statement			0
that bloodshed is " just the start , " the @entity160 message warned -- a threat that may or may not be hollow , but nonetheless adds extra urgency for @entity7 investigators			0
@entity1 's @entity176 reported from @entity0 and @entity177 wrote from @entity178			1
@entity1 's @entity179 and @entity180 contributed to this report .			0

the bodies of four @entity4 tourists killed in @entity0 are returned to @entity4
the uncle and cousin of one of the suspected gunmen say they had no idea he had been radicalized
