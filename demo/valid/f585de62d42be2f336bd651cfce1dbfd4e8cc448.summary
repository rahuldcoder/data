@entity2 @entity1 president @entity0 confirmed that a third person took part in last week 's @entity7 terror attack in an interview sunday with @entity11 tv station @entity9			1
" there were for certain three terrorists , " @entity0 said			2
" there is one on the run			2
he will not get far			2
" previously two suspects had been identified -- @entity18 and @entity19 -- though it was n't immediately clear if they were the pair killed at the museum by @entity1 security forces			1
he said @entity18 was " known to the security services , he was flagged and monitored , " but not known or being followed for anything special			0
authorities have arrested nine people in connection with the attack , including four directly linked to it , according to @entity0			2
the development came a day after the bodies of four @entity36 tourists slain in the attack arrived back in @entity36 , an official with the @entity39 told @entity3 , but 14 victims ' remains still lie in the morgue			1
most of the 23 victims were foreigners , making the process of identification more complicated			0
nineteen of them were tourists who 'd been on two cruise ships that docked in @entity2			1
@entity11 , @entity51 , @entity36 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 citizens are among those to have been formally identified so far			1
the bodies of the @entity36 were met in @entity57 by @entity36 prime minister @entity58 , who paid his respects to the victims and their families in a brief ceremony			1
eleven people who were injured in the attack remained in the hospital in @entity1 on saturday , the official at the @entity39 said			1
an uncle of @entity18 , @entity68 , told @entity3 on friday that no one he knew had seen any signs of extremism in his 26 - year - old nephew			0
but he said @entity18 was one of the two gunmen killed at the museum			1
" it 's true that @entity18 carried out this terrorist attack , he was killed ; his head , his body , we do n't have it back , " he said			1
but , he said , he believed @entity82 and other young tunisians like him were also victims of terrorism -- of the recruiters who paid them money , organized the logistics and took them to places like @entity90 and @entity91 to train as fighters			0
he had known his nephew well , he said			0
" after the revolution of 2011 he started to pray , before he would drink beers from time to time , like a young @entity1			1
he was n't extreme in any way			0
" the only thing that raised questions was that @entity18 had disappeared for about a month , he said			0
although his nephew said he 'd gone to the @entity1 city of @entity101 to work , his family now suspected he had been in @entity91 because of the phone numbers he called from			1
" when he came back his behavior was the same : he was still himself , calm , serious			0
nobody noticed anything , even the neighbors i spoke to , " said @entity68			0
" he said hello to everyone , he prayed , he took his coffee , even on the day of the attack he took his coffee with his family and went to work			2
" @entity68 said @entity18 's father , sister and brother had undergone lengthy interrogations by anti-terror police since the attack			2
officers had seized his nephew 's computer and phone , as well as taking samples of his fingerprints , he said			0
a cousin of @entity18 , who asked not to be named , told @entity3 that the family was shocked by what had happened			0
" we are all shocked , we lost someone even if what he did was wrong , may @entity130 forgive him			0
those he killed were innocent , why would you go and harm @entity134 or @entity53 ... our @entity131 does n't mention about killing people , @entity131 has never been this , " he said			2
he also said he had no idea how his cousin had been radicalized , saying he was " a normal @entity1 guy ... but not an extremist			1
" security minister @entity140 said on friday that the two extremists who attacked the museum got weapons training at camps in @entity91			2
the suspects were activated from sleeper cells in @entity1 , he said			1
he did not say which group activated them , or with whom they trained			0
" they left the country illegally last december for @entity91 , and they were able to train with weapons there , " he told private broadcaster @entity149			0
like @entity1 , @entity91 saw its longtime leader @entity156 ousted during the regional wave of revolutions known as the @entity159			1
but unlike its neighbor to the west , @entity91 has been fraught with more instability and violence -- much of it perpetrated by @entity165 militants			0
in an audio message posted online thursday , @entity166 claimed responsibility for wednesday 's attack , which it said targeted " crusaders and apostates " with " automatic weapons and hand grenades			2
" @entity3 can not independently verify the legitimacy of the audio statement			0
that bloodshed is " just the start , " the @entity166 message warned -- a threat that may or may not be hollow , but nonetheless adds extra urgency for @entity1 investigators			1
@entity3 's @entity182 reported from @entity2 and @entity183 wrote from @entity184			1
@entity3 's @entity185 and @entity186 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 president says third person who took part in museum attack is on the run
the bodies of four @entity36 tourists killed in @entity2 are returned to @entity36
