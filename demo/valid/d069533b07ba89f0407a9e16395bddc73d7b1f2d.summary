while @entity1 and other @entity3 cities have suffered through their snowiest seasons , other parts of the country have some unexpected good news to go along with the record - breaking winter conditions			2
all that cold air and a stuck weather pattern are keeping tornadoes to historic lows so far this year			2
march is typically a transitional month , where warm moist air from the @entity14 collides with cold @entity17 air to produce severe thunderstorms and tornadoes			2
this year , however , the jet stream pattern responsible for all the cold air and snow in the @entity23 remains stuck in more of a winter mode			2
" we 're in a persistent pattern that suppresses severe weather , and the right ingredients -- moisture , instability and lift -- ( have yet to come together ) , " said @entity25 , the @entity26 with the @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29			0
the group is responsible for issuing the tornado and severe thunderstorm watches that warn the public of impending severe weather			1
so far this year it 's been extremely quiet			1
by this time in mid-march the center would have issued 52 tornado watches nationwide			1
this year they have issued a paltry four			0
both january and february were well below normal			0
march has been even quieter			0
at a time where the tornado season usually ramps up considerably , there has not been a single report this month of a tornado			1
" we are in uncharted territory with respect to the lack of severe weather " @entity25 said			0
in fact if we make it through the entire month of march without any tornado reports it would be a first , according to the center			1
there have been around 20 tornadoes reported since january 1 , well below the 10 - year average of 130 for the period from the beginning of the year until mid-march			0
this year comes on the heels of what was has been a welcome lull of tornadoes across the @entity69 the past several years			0
in 2014 , we ended the year with a count of 881 , well below the average of 1,253			0
meteorologists do n't fully understand why we have seen the recent drop in tornadoes , but one possible answer is the development of @entity77 , a warming in the equatorial @entity79 , which can influence weather patterns globally			1
recent studies point to lower tornado counts in the @entity69 during these events			1
the @entity84 recently said that a weak @entity77 had developed			1
so while all agree this is good news so far this year , it is clear that it is no guarantee that the rest of the season will remain this quiet			1
weather patterns can change quickly			0
in 1984 , for instance , there was a very similar slow start through mid-march and the number of tornadoes ended up well above average by the end of june , according to data from the storm center			1
it 's also important to note that even in years where the tornado counts are low , you can still have very violent tornadoes -- 2013 being a perfect example			2
the year ended being roughly 30 % below normal for the number of tornadoes , yet included some of the strongest tornadoes on record			0
the twisters in @entity114 and @entity115 , @entity29 , occurred in may of that year with devastating results			0

there have been only four tornado watches in 2015
@entity77 might be helping keep the numbers down
slow start does n't mean it will be quiet for entire season
