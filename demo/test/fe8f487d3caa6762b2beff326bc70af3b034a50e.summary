saturday at the masters , like any @entity3 tournament , has been dubbed ' @entity4 '			2
it 's the day after the fat has been cut and the big dogs make their move up -- or occasionally down -- the leader board			2
players rose and players fell away on @entity4 at the 2015 masters			1
@entity13 went out in 32 and briefly raised the crowd 's hopes that he had a sniff of completing an improbable @entity17 on sunday night			1
but he dropped two shots late on in the round to finish six under par. woods comeback ? a rejuvenated @entity22 showed touches of his old class mixed with the ragged unpredictability that has marked his new game to finish six under too			1
a huge improvement , but still a long way from him wearing the green jacket again			2
" it could have been a super low today , " a disappointed @entity22 said after his round			1
it should have been two shots better			2
" @entity33 powered around the course , threatening to challenge too , finishing on eleven under			0
as did a late @entity36 surge , where he fired four birdies in a row to finish twelve under and in second place			0
in the end , there was lots of moving , but no one could move quick enough or far enough to trouble @entity44			1
@entity46 the 21 year old has been nothing short of a sensation at @entity50			1
his infallible first two rounds gave the 21 year old from @entity52 , @entity53 a five shot lead going in to the third round			1
that has happened only three times at @entity50 before , and on all three occasions the leader has gone on to win			0
@entity44 's 15 birdies are just 10 away from @entity33 's masters mark set in 2001			1
he could also break @entity22 270 set in 1997			1
as it happened , @entity44 played a steady , almost conservative round			1
when he made the occasional mistake , like the bogey at 15 , he hit back straight away with a birdie next hole			0
as his third round came to a close the birdies flowed , his putting impeccable			0
the only nerves on show came during the last two holes with a double bogey at the 17			0
echos of 1996 ? when reminded of some of the great @entity50 comebacks , including @entity79 's 11 shot swing in 1996 , @entity22 still believes anything is possible			1
" it really is , " he said			0
" we saw what happened in 1996			0
it depends on the conditions			0
" he is , of course , right			0
as @entity90 knows only too well , anything can happen on the final day			0
but that kind of crescendo also depends on @entity44 experiencing a @entity90 - style meltdown			2
@entity44 's double bogey on the 17th and wobble on the 18th will give the chasing pack some hope			2
yet , for all the movement of @entity33 , @entity22 , @entity101 and @entity13 , they made just a one shot dent into @entity44 's second round lead			1
he will begin sunday four shots ahead .			0

@entity44 holds lead in 2015 masters
strong starts from @entity13 and @entity22
both fall away as 21 year old @entity44 takes control
