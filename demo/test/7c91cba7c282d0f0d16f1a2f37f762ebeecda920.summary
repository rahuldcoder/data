just before writing this column , i reached into the depths of my wallet , and in between the pilot licenses , i slid out a postage stamp - size certificate issued by the @entity8			1
the certificate documents my successful completion of the @entity10 , or @entity11 , online course			0
the online course verifies that i am knowledgeable to fly a plane under visual flight rules into the most highly restricted @entity16 airspace in the country			1
although a " no - fly zone " over the @entity20 has long existed , the @entity11 airspace was developed to protect the @entity22 area further after the 9/11 terrorist attacks			1
the size of the @entity11 airspace is designed to be large enough to give our defense forces enough time to determine if a threat exists from an aircraft entering it , an opportunity to identify the threat , and if necessary , to divert or eliminate it			1
an airspeed restriction begins at a 60 - mile radius from the center of @entity36			0
at the 30 - mile radius , all aircraft must file a flight plan that identifies itself to air traffic control via a specific four - digit transponder code ( a transponder is an electronic communication device that identifies a specific airplane on an air traffic controller 's display screen to indicate authorization for the flight )			1
aircraft must enter the @entity11 through specific flight " gates " that are displayed on a standard aviation map			2
aircraft on instrument flight rule flight plans , which include all airline operations , are not required to comply with @entity11 restrictions			2
air traffic control assumes the responsibility for the appropriate routing			0
as a matter of standard procedure , flights using an instrument flight rule flight plan have specific clearances with specific transponder codes , so the authorization for transit through the @entity11 airspace is already built into the system			1
why do i carry the certificate as an airline pilot ? i have had occasion to fly my own little airplane through the airspace on a visual flight rule flight plan			1
pilot who landed gyrocopter blogged about why noncompliance with the airspace requirements , or worse , no communication at all , carries some serious federal penalties , which could include the suspension or revocation of your pilot license			1
being at the wrong end of an f - 16 missile is also a possible penalty			0
so how does a flying machine that looks like a sophisticated lawn chair with helicopter blades invade such highly restricted airspace , as happened wednesday , when a postal carrier from @entity92 landed a single - person aircraft on @entity95 grounds ? well , i 'm making an assumption based on the video footage , but it appears that this aircraft is classified by the @entity8 as a gyrocopter			1
a gyrocopter can not quite launch straight up into the air in the manner of a typical helicopter ; it requires a short ground run for takeoff			2
and most gyrocopters are kit - built aircraft			0
it also appears that this particular gyrocopter may weigh just under 255 pounds , which classifies it as an ultralight aircraft in @entity8 parlance			1
why is weight significant ? below that weight , a license for the pilot or a license for the aircraft is not required			0
in addition , to remain in the classification , the maximum designed airspeed ca n't exceed 55 knots			0
lawmaker looking into gyrocopter landing as pilot goes to court a facility tracking the movement of this particular gyrocopter on radar would witness a speed probably attainable by the average @entity133 goose			1
and the radar reflection on a piece of machinery of that diminutive size is most likely very limited			2
if it was actually tracked on a radar screen , the target may have appeared to be a flock of birds			2
how much damage could this aircraft have inflicted had it been intended for nefarious purposes ? well , if it had been crashed into a building , i feel confident that the building would have been triumphant			0
if the intent had been to carry some sort of destructive device , the weapon would have had to be relatively small			0
the engine is not designed to carry more than one pilot			0
and lack of carry - on space is a definite issue			0
not that a review of airspace security measures is n't in order , but i would n't be concerned that this event will become the next threat epidemic			0
as an airline pilot , i can say i am relatively confident that our nation 's capital is secure from gyrocopter attacks orchestrated by misguided lunatics .			2

@entity170 : how did gyrocopter fly on to @entity95 grounds when @entity8 , defense forces keep tight rein on airspace ?
he says gyrocopter may be *lightweight* and slow enough that it *evaded* radar
he says it 's unlikely such a flight could pose a serious *danger*
