on tuesday , a white police officer in @entity1 , @entity2 , was charged with murder for shooting an unarmed black man in the back			1
officer @entity7 was arrested after raw video surfaced showing him firing numerous shots at @entity10 as @entity10 ran away from a traffic stop			2
the video footage contradicts @entity7 's statement that he felt threatened after @entity10 allegedly took his stun gun during a scuffle			0
the @entity16 and @entity17 reported that the @entity18 has opened an investigation into the shooting death along with the @entity21 , while the @entity2 attorney general is investigating possible civil rights violations			1
now , after watching the footage — which should remain in your memory for a long time to come — one could say that @entity7 shot @entity10 like a dog			0
but then again , dogs usually are not treated this badly			0
but the man was shot like a runaway slave			2
in this case , there was clear documented evidence of what occurred , and no room for fabrications			0
most police fatal shootings do not result in indictments because prosecutors conclude they are justifiable			2
the police officer can always plant a gun on the suspect he shot to death , or like @entity7 , apparently place a taser near @entity10 's body and concoct some story that his life was in danger			1
" we ca n't bring mr. @entity10 back , but something like this today can have a bigger precedence than just what happened here with mr. @entity10			1
because what happened today does n't happen all the time , " said @entity56 @entity55 , an attorney for the @entity10 family , at a press conference			2
" i do n't think that all police officers are bad cops , but there are some bad ones out there			2
and i do n't want to see anyone get shot down the way that my brother got shot down , " said @entity64 , brother of the victim			0
" what if there was no video ? what if there was no witness , or hero as i call him , to come forward ? then this would n't have happened , because as you can see , the initial reports stated something totally different			2
the officer said that mr. @entity10 attacked him and pulled his taser and tried to use it on him			2
but somebody was watching , " @entity55 added			0
" after watching the video , the senseless shooting and taking of # @entity88 's life was absolutely unnecessary and avoidable , " tweeted sen. @entity84			0
" my heart aches for the family and our @entity1 community			0
i will be watching this case closely			0
" although the black community and others have been aware for years of the problem of police brutality , through personal experience and anecdotes , the data confirm that police use of deadly force is a black and white issue			1
a @entity105 analysis of police shootings from 2010 to 2012 found that young black males are 21 times more likely to be fatally shot by the police than young white males			1
and 67 % of teens killed while fleeing or resisting arrest were black			2
of the whites who are killed by cops , 91 % are killed by white cops			0
sixty - eight percent of people of color who are killed by police are also killed by white officers			1
furthermore , 10 % of police involved in fatal shootings are black , and 78 % of the people killed by black officers are black			1
according to @entity123 of @entity124 , the disproportionate representation of blacks and other people of color in police shootings is due to the role of racial stereotypes by police			1
racial stereotypes , @entity132 argues , subconsciously influence an officer 's decision on whether to use deadly force , even if the police do not consciously decide to use deadly force based on race			1
a simple question posed to the officer by a black person could be perceived as a threat to the officer 's authority			1
what 's more , a @entity146 study on deadly force found that participants felt more threatened in scenarios involving black suspects , suggesting participants " held subconscious biases associating blacks and threats			1
" @entity10 is the latest in a long line of black bodies , from @entity158 in @entity159 , @entity160 , and @entity161 in @entity162 , to @entity163 near @entity164 , @entity165 , and @entity166 and @entity167 in @entity168			0
in this case , the bystander video of @entity10 's killing and the cover - up of the crime by @entity7 made the difference			0
otherwise , the bogus narrative of the good white cop protecting himself from the menacing black thug may have prevailed			1
what happened in @entity1 tells us the epidemic of police deadly force has not died			1
and yet , the mobilization and heightened consciousness of people across the nation have kept the issue on the front burner			0
the taking of black lives by the police remains a crisis situation in @entity192 that must be addressed , because # @entity193			1
may @entity10 rest in peace			0
the arrest and charging of officer @entity7 is a rare event that must be celebrated for the small victory that it is , in the midst of unspeakable tragedy			0
but this is by no means over .			0

a white police officer in @entity2 is charged with killing an unarmed black man in the back
@entity208 : what happened tells us the epidemic of police deadly force against black people continues
