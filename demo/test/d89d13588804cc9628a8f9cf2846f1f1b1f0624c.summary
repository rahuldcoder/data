@entity0 put himself in harm 's way to help , heading to @entity4 to work on a much needed reconstruction project following deadly flooding there			1
his work and his life , as he knew it then , came to a halt on january 19 , 2012			0
that 's when , according to @entity15 's state - run @entity14 news agency , four armed men burst into the building where @entity0 lived and abducted him along with colleague @entity18			1
two years later , @entity0 was dead -- killed accidentally by a @entity20 drone strike , according to @entity20 authorities			1
the native of the @entity24 city of @entity25 died along with a fellow @entity28 hostage , @entity20 @entity29			1

at the time he was taken captive , @entity0 worked with the @entity51 aid organization @entity50 , a 53 - year - old group dedicated to fighting hunger and poverty worldwide			1
such work means going to places where the need is most -- places like @entity59 in @entity4			0
that community was one of many in @entity4 devastated by major flooding in 2010 , which covered about one - fifth of the country and left more than 1,500 people dead			0
these conditions are all too common in the @entity69 nation , as evidenced by flooding one year later that forced upwards of 660,000 into refugee camps and killed more than 430 people , about a quarter of whom were children			0

@entity88 described @entity0 as a lively , very positive man who made friends all over the world			1
some of those friends in @entity15 , @entity94 and beyond pressed for @entity0 's release after he was taken captive , urging @entity15 's government and newspaper editors to get his story out , @entity14 reported			1
the same story said that @entity28 ( after first claiming he was being held ) denied abducting @entity0 , as did the @entity4 @entity100			2
@entity18 , a @entity51 national , was freed last october , at which time he said that he and his colleague had been separated , according to @entity14			0
but @entity0 never got the chance to savor freedom again , like his @entity51 counterpart			2
@entity15 foreign minister @entity105 said his country 's government " carried out every effort possible to trace and try to return @entity0 to his loved ones			2
" " unfortunately , the conclusion is now different ( than we wanted ) because of the tragic and fatal mistake of our @entity20 allies , which has been recognized by president @entity114 , " @entity105 said			2
" the responsibility of his death and ( that ) of @entity29 ... is that of the terrorists			0
" on thursday , after the @entity20 government reported @entity0 's death , @entity15 prime minister @entity118 expressed his " deepest sorrow for the death of an @entity15 who dedicated his life to the service of others			1
" @entity0 's death left those at his former charity @entity128 and confused , @entity88 said			2
