there is a special kind of hell reserved for the women who fall into the clutches of today 's @entity7 fighters			1
we are all familiar with the brutality of @entity10 , the self - anointed @entity11 , or @entity12 , the @entity14 terrorists who have pledged allegiance to @entity10			1
this new wave of violent @entity18 groups proudly brandishes medieval methods of cruelty through modern technology as a tool of recruitment and intimidation			1
but there is something very different about the way they treat women			2
the jihadi chiefs have a strategy beyond the battlefield			2
their treatment of their female victims plays an important part in their ambitious radical strategy			0
killing the enemy , the men , is a tactic for winning battles and conquering territory			0
what they do to women has an altogether different purpose : it is part of the larger plan of building a " caliphate , " a @entity49 - ruled state complete with controls and norms harking back to the seventh century or , rather , to the group 's interpretation of life in the early days of @entity55			1
@entity57 girls who slipped @entity10 after its siege of @entity59 describe how they were sent to slave warehouses along with hundreds of other women			1
there , they were lined up in groups of 50 and displayed for @entity10 fighters to choose among them , some for marriage , others for sexual slavery			1
the stories told to journalists or to human rights workers are confirmed by doctors who have examined the girls and say they have found evidence of repeated sexual assault			0
an investigation by @entity74 found " a system of organized rape and sexual assault , sexual slavery , and forced marriage by @entity10 forces , " actions that the group says " are war crimes and may be crimes against humanity			1
" in @entity14 , @entity12 also has a very specific approach to women			2
the 276 students kidnapped one year ago make up a small portion of the 2,000 women and girls kidnapped by the group since 2014 , according to @entity91			2
there , too , women captives move from house to house and village to village , forced to convert when they are not @entity98 , and prepare for marriage to jihadis			2
it 's a stark change from the previous generation of jihadis , when @entity103 headed @entity104			0
women were not a big part of @entity104 's immediate plans because @entity104 , unlike @entity10 , viewed the establishment of a caliphate as a distant goal , one for future generations			1
in contrast , @entity10 is actively engaged in building those social structures			1
and if you want to build a new society , you need more than soldiers			2
women are indispensable for establishing a functioning community , even one whose laws are brutally repressive			2
even if women are viewed as the property of men , they are still needed , not just for cooking , cleaning and sex , but to keep the home and raise children ; hence the methodical capture , assault and subjugation			0
it is no accident that @entity12 has targeted students , as it did in @entity134 , or that @entity136 's @entity135 killed scores of women in the massacre at @entity141 's @entity140 in @entity141			0
as in previous conflicts , women are spoils of war and rape is a weapon of war			0
it is a way to humiliate the enemy , a " reward " for soldiers and a tactic of ethnic cleansing			0
during the @entity157 war of the 1990s , experts said @entity159 soldiers engaged in systematic rape , thinking the babies of raped @entity163 women would be @entity159			0
in @entity165 , government - backed militias were accused of using mass rape to humiliate the non-arab groups			0
the women are not simply abused and discarded			0
@entity10 and @entity12 are enslaving them and incorporating them into the daily life of territories they rule , subjecting them to asphyxiating restrictions and abuses that have caused many of them to attempt suicide , according to some of those who escaped -- a phenomenon reminiscent of @entity182 during the rule of the @entity184 , another radical @entity55 group that managed to take control and impose unspeakable rules for women			1
@entity10 is going to great lengths to prove how its treatment of women , including the selling of @entity57 prisoners as slaves , is in keeping with @entity55 law			1
its online magazine cites @entity55 writings proclaiming : " we will conquer your @entity197 , break your crosses , and enslave your women , by the permission of @entity202			1
" the worst fate is reserved for non-muslims , such as @entity57 , but @entity98 women in areas seized by @entity135 have seen disaster			0
from @entity208 , @entity209 's second - largest city , a modern town until @entity10 conquered it last year , women say , " they have withheld all freedoms from us " and describe oppressive , fear - filled lives			1
the brutality of the new jihadis is more than mere sadism			0
if it is madness , it is madness with a method			0
and when it comes to women , the method is one that aims to control them as a way to establish the society they envision , one where some women say life is simply not worth living .			1

@entity233 : @entity10 and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create
she says the groups want to enslave women , tie them to a long *outdated* view of how society should work
