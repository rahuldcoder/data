@entity1 , @entity2 when the earthquake struck , we huddled under a concrete beam -- and prayed			1
in another room , my grandfather could not comprehend what was happening and , instead of seeking cover , drifted towards the window			1
outside , a brown dust - cloud rose from the ruins of cottages that had dotted the next hill			1
i was at my uncle 's place in @entity18 , west @entity1 , some 12 kilometers ( 7.4 miles ) east from my family home			1
after escaping the building for the safety of open air , my first thought was for news of friends and family			1
calls did n't go through but thankfully texts and data did			1
i heard from everyone except my mother			1
worried sick , i foolishly went into the house for a second time to get my belongings and leave for home			1
another tremor -- the first of many to aftershocks that have continued to strike an already traumatized city -- shook the house			2
i took refuge under the same doorway			2
the journey towards my family home in @entity46 was a map of quake destruction , with many houses -- old and new -- torn apart			1
a high wall surrounding a monastery had collapsed and the nuns had run to a nearby field			2
a mud - and - brick cottage had fallen on a blue motorbike but no trace could be found of its rider			2
a woman perched on top of rubble tried to reach for a water container from what used to be her kitchen			1
everywhere , survivors gathered wherever they could find open space -- fields , private compounds , empty roadside lots			2
in @entity70 , an ice cream seller ran double - time with his cart , while his radio relayed the latest			1
further ahead , a mother and daughter sat down on a pavement so that a grandchild could be fed. across the @entity81 , uphill towards @entity80 , i ran to get away from the tall houses and made towards the @entity83			1
it was reduced to rubble			1
a blood donation camp was said to be buried by the same structure that sheltered it			2
locals were searching for survivors , but progress was slow			2
the @entity93 temple had caved in			2
temples that sat on impressive staircase - style pyramids were now dust			1
the western fa√ßade of the @entity100 palace had fallen apart and nothing remained of the remained of the nine - story medieval palace nearby			0
meanwhile , the curio fleamarket was flooded with people who had made it out of the cramped quarters of @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , and nearby neighborhoods			0
in @entity112 , i met a cousin who was sitting an entrance exam for a prestigious high school when the quake hit before the allotted time was over			1
he kept wondering out loud whether he could retake the test			0
the two of us walked through @entity121 , trying to trace a few acquaintances , and up @entity123 to @entity124			0
a hawker was selling momos -- a @entity2 type of dumpling -- under a seven - story building , while policemen guarded a jailhouse			1
people gathered mostly in the middle of crossroads , on traffic islands and around metal pulpits , which looked out of range of falling buildings			0
i reached home and found both my parents alive and uninjured			0
i could n't believe that our 30 - year - old house was still standing			0
as i walked my cousin to where his parents were , we kept hearing rumors : " more quakes forecast by experts for 5 p.m. and midnight			0
" as if to confirm , tremors shook us at six and more would follow at 10 p.m. and midnight , with smaller shocks throughout the night			0
along the northern boundary of the former royal museum , the wall had collapsed and people had poured out of the @entity157 neighborhood onto the palace lawn			0
@entity160 military tents meant for two people were now packed with six and the army was trying hard to accommodate as many as possible			0
in @entity164 , an electricity pole had squashed an abandoned taxi			0
a few men took turns taking photos with the wrecked car			0
in @entity172 , a handful of backpackers were discussing where to make camp			0
back home , my parents decided against going to the nearby @entity178 football field where families were sleeping on plastic mattresses under rudimentary tents			0
instead , their tactic was to stay on the ground floor , be awakened by tremors , and then scamper to a corner of our garden that seemed relatively safe			0
i did not sleep a wink .			0

journalist @entity190 was visiting relatives with @entity2 's *7.8* *magnitude* quake struck
