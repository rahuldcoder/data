with help from some filmmakers , 102 - year - old @entity0 went back in time			1
@entity0 was a dancer in such @entity5 nightspots as the @entity6 and the @entity7 in the 1930s and 1940s , part of chorus lines that entertained alongside notables including @entity12 and @entity13			1
there were motion pictures made of @entity0 , but she had never seen any of them			2
moreover , her photographs and memorabilia had all been lost over the years			0
so she had never seen herself actually dancing -- until now			0
@entity19 of jazz - on - film.com and some volunteers put together a video of " soundies " -- early music videos -- and showed them to @entity0 at the nursing home where she lives			1
the ageless dancer was delighted			0
" it 's just fabulous , " she said .			0

@entity0 was a dancer in the 1930s and ' 40s
thanks to filmmakers , @entity0 -- now 102 -- *finally* saw herself dance
