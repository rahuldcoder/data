beautiful friend , the end			0
for the 1960s , the end arrived with -- depending on your ideals and your tribe -- either the @entity11 ' @entity10 in december 1969 , the @entity13 shootings in may 1970 or @entity15 's 1972 re-election			1
for " @entity16 , " the " end of an era , " as its slogan has it , begins sunday			1
over the past eight years , the show about a 1960s advertising agency and its collision with changing times has become part of the national fabric , if never a huge ratings hit			1
stores have created fashion lines inspired by the show ; there have been " @entity16 " cocktails and " @entity16 " museum exhibits and even " @entity16 " presidential references			1
@entity34 , the creative director played by @entity35 , has become a symbol of the times -- his and , sometimes , ours			0
its subjects have taken the show to heart			2
in march , a " @entity16 " bench was unveiled in front of @entity46 's @entity45 , where the fictional firm of @entity16 & partners has its headquarters			1
the end of a tv series brings with it some risk			1
" @entity55 , " " @entity16 " creator @entity54 's former employer , divided fans with its famous cut - to - black finale			1
on the other hand , " @entity16 's " former @entity60 stablemate , " @entity61 , " was saluted for an almost perfect landing			1
speaking of landings : the last season -- technically , the first half of season 7 -- ended with the moon landing in july 1969			0
though @entity54 and his cast have been typically tight - lipped -- @entity54 even hid the finale from his cast at first -- it 's reasonable to assume the new season will pick up soon afterward			2
what 's going to happen ? here are some educated guesses			1
with the ' 60s screaming towards their conclusion , " @entity16 " probably wo n't jump ahead much			1
the latter half of 1969 included the @entity80 murders , the @entity81 , a @entity46 mayoral campaign and the @entity84 moratorium demonstrations -- plenty of fodder for the characters to interact with , if only tangentially			2
who knows ? the show might even mention the @entity90			2
it would be a nice way to acknowledge the agency 's late @entity93			2
of course , @entity54 might have a different idea ; he 's from @entity96			2
" @entity16 " is generally a show about disintegration , reflective of the ' 60s themselves			1
the old orders are falling apart : white - shoe wasp firms like @entity16 giving way to the ethnic pace - setters such as @entity104 ; grimy @entity46 replaced by sunny @entity105 ; the " @entity107 " generation butting heads with the " @entity110 " cohort ; vacuum tubes and ledger books being displaced by a sleek , solid - state @entity114 world			1
it 's all an ad agency can do to keep up			2
last season saw plenty of intraoffice turmoil , thanks to the ill - fitting merger between @entity16 and former rival @entity123 and @entity124			1
though the agency survived , it 's now without @entity16 ( @entity127 ) and under the ownership of ( real - life ) @entity132 titan @entity130			1
that 's not a recipe for long - term survival , and expect a number of longtime characters -- @entity138 ( @entity139 ) , @entity140 ( @entity141 ) and perhaps even @entity142 ( @entity143 ) -- to look for an exit			1
@entity145 -- the wisecracking executive played by @entity146 -- might find an exit as well , but not one he 's anticipating			2
he 's suffered two heart attacks			0
he 's never grown up			0
bet on a sudden and shocking departure			0
on the other hand , @entity152 's star has continued to rise ( much like one of the character 's models , advertising wunderkind @entity154 )			0
she left @entity16 once ; indeed , she would n't have returned if her new agency had n't merged with her old one			1
if @entity152 , played by @entity160 , bolts the firm , it will probably be to head her own agency -- and possibly get married			0
that is , if she 's still interested in such an old - fashioned tradition			0
in recent seasons , @entity34 's ex-wife , @entity165 ) , has lost herself amid all the turmoil			0
she sees herself through the eyes of her spouses , and though husband @entity170 ( @entity171 ) has been far more supportive than @entity34 , he 's a busy man			0
and @entity172 , @entity34 's daughter ( @entity172 ) , is proving to be a handful			0
on the one hand , she 's obviously bright ; on the other , she 's a teenager and starting to rebel			0
in recent seasons she 's run away and started sneaking cigarettes , and she 's always fighting with her mother			0
you could see her hitchhiking to @entity81 , or at least dropping out of school			0
anything 's possible , but given all that the character has been through -- divorces , affairs , office politics , morose late - night rides with @entity185 -- it 's a bit on the nose , is n't it ? instead , try this : it 's april 1 , 1970			1
@entity15 is signing legislation banning cigarette ads on radio and television , reminding @entity34 of the day 10 years earlier when he came up with the @entity195 campaign that began the series			0
no fool , he had seen this day coming years before			0
he 'll fix himself a drink , ponder buying an avocado - colored refrigerator , clean out his ashtray and leave the show the way he arrived : on top of the zeitgeist , unable to accept his past and utterly , inscrutably alone .			0

" @entity16 's " final seven *episodes* begin airing april 5
the show has never had high ratings but is considered one of the great tv series
it 's *unknown* what will happen to characters , but we can always guess
