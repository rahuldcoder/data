@entity0 is known for his swagger			1
should he act any differently when he 's on trial for murder ? when the once rising star for the @entity6 walks into court each day with what appears to be an air of confidence -- or is it bravado ? -- he enters from a connecting holding room			1
some court security officers who escort him are as tall and muscular as he is			2
besides that certain bounce to his step , there 's usually a smile			1
jury deliberations resume wednesday watch " @entity22 : inside the case against @entity0 " tonight at 9 p.m. et. it has n't been there as often in the last couple of weeks when state witnesses have included his fiancée @entity29 and his former boss , @entity6 owner @entity24 , who testified @entity0 would usually greet him with a kiss and a hug			1
always impeccably dressed in suit and tie brought in by his defense team , @entity0 quickly scans the courtroom , usually starting with the rows of seats directly behind him			1
the front row is reserved for his family			2
some days , none of his relatives is there			2
but when his mother , fiancée , brother and other friends attend , he winks , nods , smiles , jokes , laughs , flirts with his fiancée and mouths greetings to them including " ' thanks for coming ' and ' i love you			2
' " twice , he nodded his head and smiled at me			0
it 's not unusual for his lawyers to slap him on his back and huddle before court begins , appearing at ease			0
they 've been representing him since june 2013			0
there was an unfortunate moment			0
his mother once asked permission from a court officer to touch her son once the jury left the room			0
given an ok , she reached over the bar to him , took one of his hands in hers and kissed it			0
it did not go unnoticed by the family of victim @entity77			0
@entity0 does not avoid looking in their direction			1
he glances at @entity77 's relatives			0
@entity77 's mother @entity81 , who is in court daily , appears to look right back at @entity0 without expression from her usual seat on the end of a row			1
when one witness , a high school friend , testifies that @entity0 once allegedly talked about carrying a gun , @entity0 appears to glare at him			2
when his fiancée takes the stand and testifies @entity0 told her to ditch a box from their basement the day after @entity77 's slaying , his eyes are glued on her			1
she barely glances his way but does appear to say something as she passes the defense table on the way out			0
when @entity101 is asked to officially point out @entity0 in court and describe what he was wearing , i watch @entity0 look down at his shirt and tie as @entity101 detailed his outfit			1
when the team owner leaves the stand -- the same man who signed him to a $ 40 million bonus in 2012 -- @entity0 turns and watches him walk out of the courtroom			1
would it be the last time he 'd see him in person ? on the last day of testimony when his defense rests its case , he smiles at relatives			0
but as he walks out the door this time , he does n't look back .			0

@entity0 , even when on trial for murder , keeps that certain bounce in his step
@entity0 seemed to watch his former boss and fiancee *closely* when they were on the stand
