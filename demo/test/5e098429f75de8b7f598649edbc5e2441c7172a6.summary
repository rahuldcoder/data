i will always remember when things turned			1
i was 12 years old , and my younger sister and i were with our parents attending a peaceful demonstration in downtown @entity7 near the courthouse			1
we were there to protest the acquittal of four police officers in the beating death of unarmed motorcyclist @entity13			1
i had learned the word " acquittal " just that day			1
it meant they would n't be held responsible			1
community leaders were gathered at the front , speaking to a crowd that was in shock and full of anger and despair			1
the trial had been covered extensively , and nobody could believe that the fatal beating -- with the extent of the physical wounds to @entity13 's head and body -- could be justified or excused			1
i started to hear rumblings coming from around the perimeter of the immediate crowd			1
there was shouting and cursing			2
then a car was turned over and set on fire			2
that was @entity7 35 years ago , but it could just as easily have been @entity41 this week			1
the @entity7 riots of 1980 were the first major " race riots " since the wave of riots spread across the nation in the 1960s			1
@entity48 1964 : police shooting of 15 - year - old @entity50			2
@entity51 1965 : arrest of 21 - year - old @entity51 for drunken driving			2
@entity53 1967 : police beating of @entity55 while under arrest			2
@entity57 1967 : police raid on a " blind pig " after - hours bar			2
then the rev. @entity60 was assassinated , and @entity41 and 125 other cities erupted in flames			1
the immediate catalysts for the waves of riots in the 1960s before the death of dr. @entity60 were police action , or , more specifically , perceived unjust police action			2
that was true in @entity7 in 1980 after the acquittal of the police officers			1
and the same in @entity73 in 1992 after the acquittal of police officers for the beating of motorist @entity77			2
wednesday marks the 23rd anniversary of the start of the @entity73 riots			2
and now we have @entity41 2015 , with the death of suspect @entity83 in police custody			1
my parents were leaders and participants in the nonviolent civil rights movement , and they raised me to understand that youths were the key to the movement			1
it was the images of young people all over the country -- often facing physical danger , discipline from their parents and suspension from school -- that propelled the civil rights movement into the national spotlight			2
juxtapose decades - old images of youths being hosed down by police during nonviolent demonstrations in @entity106 and @entity107 with tuesday 's images of @entity41 youths throwing rocks at police , and you wonder what has happened			1
as a 12 - year - old girl in @entity7 , i did n't understand how people could injure and even kill others and destroy their neighborhoods , and risk going to jail , by rioting			1
i was afraid because i did n't see my father for days as he and other community leaders walked the streets to try to restore calm			2
i was also afraid that such senseless violence could only derail the legitimate causes of the @entity127 - @entity127 community , causes historically advanced by nonviolent civil disobedience and through legislative channels			1
but two months ago , i agreed to moderate a panel at the @entity131 called " riot -- @entity133 of the @entity134 ? " the occasion was to mark the @entity137 premiere of " @entity57 ' 67 , " a play written by @entity139 and directed by @entity140 that chronicled the journey of a family as they lived through the turmoil of the @entity57 ' 67 riot , including the joy and love they found with one another			2
the play and the panel were programmed by @entity151 , a nonprofit devoted to presenting artistic interpretations with diverse voices so that individuals and institutions can have a shared platform in their quest for understanding in @entity127 society			2
inspired by the mission , i had recently joined the board			0
although pegged to the past , the purpose of the panel was to examine how current events relating to police actions against @entity127 men could potentially lead to rioting and what could be done to prevent it			0
i learned that some questioned whether riots are actually purposeless and uncontrolled violence , or whether they are purposeful uprisings against individuals and institutions			0
i learned that those who participate in riots often feel hopeless and dehumanized , both as the victims of police action against them that triggered the riots and as perpetrators of violence during riots			0
i learned that riots in the 1960s played a role in advancing the civil rights agenda , often by galvanizing local and national government officials to work with peaceful community , church and civil rights leaders to address the root causes of riots			0
this is a controversial part of our civil rights history that has been sanitized			0
at the conclusion of the 1967 @entity57 riot , president @entity196 condemned the violence but said in his address to the nation that : " this is not a time for angry reaction			0
it is a time for action , starting with legislative action to improve the life in our cities			0
the strength and promise of the law are the surest remedies for tragedy in the street			0
... " his administration convened the @entity218 to examine the 1965 - 68 riots , and its findings were that racism had led to joblessness , poverty , a lack of political power , unfair housing , police brutality and inferior schools			1
after the beating of @entity77 in @entity73 , the @entity229 was established and concluded that racial profiling and excessive force , unjust treatment in the criminal justice system , poor housing , and the lack of jobs and education were triggers for the riots			0
after all of these riots , the affected city , state and national governments enacted plans and programs to address some of these underlying conditions			0
maybe the @entity41 youths involved in the riots felt the way one youth did in @entity51 in 1965			1
as recounted in " @entity252 " by @entity253 , dr. @entity60 went to @entity51 to try to calm tensions , and a hostile youth said to him : " we won			0
" @entity60 challenged him : " how have you won ? homes are destroyed , blacks are dead in the streets , stores you shop from for food and clothes are destroyed			0
" the young man replied , " we won because we made the whole world pay attention ... the police chief and mayor had never been here			0
" dr. @entity60 would say near the end of his life : " it is not enough for me to stand before you tonight and condemn riots			0
it would be morally irresponsible for me to do that without , at the same time , condemning the contingent , intolerable conditions that exist in our society			0
these conditions are the things that cause individuals to feel that they have no other alternative than to engage in violent rebellions to get attention			0
and i must say tonight that a riot is the language of the unheard			0
" when i learned that @entity41 high school students planned a purge based on the movie " @entity293 , " in which people were legally absolved for their anarchistic crimes , it suddenly made sense			1
they thought they would n't be held responsible for their crimes			0
they thought they would be absolved -- a word not much different from the word " acquitted " i learned the day of the @entity7 riots			1
but they got it wrong			0
they will forever live the repercussions of their actions , regardless of the impetus			0
but the rev. @entity311 got it right when he said he would open his @entity313 in @entity41 to youths who would not be in school so he could teach them the power of nonviolence to change society			1
that power was evident after the shooting of @entity321 in @entity322 , @entity323 , and the decision not to indict the officer who killed him			1
those protests were mostly peaceful			0
and the government responded -- not out of fear of violence , but because of a desire to change the conditions that led to the protests			0
after several months of investigation , the far - reaching @entity335 report on @entity322 issued in march concluded that the use of policing to raise revenue , combined with a systemic racial bias , had led to a pattern and practice of discrimination and @entity344 , 14th , @entity346 and first amendment rights violations against african - americans in @entity322			0
the report made recommendations that the @entity349 , as well as other departments across the country , should enact to improve police relations in communities of color			0
the riots in @entity41 have rightfully been quashed , but the voices of nonviolent protesters continue to be heard .			1

@entity359 : the anger and *frustration* i saw in 1980 @entity7 is repeated in 2015 @entity41
she says teaching the power of nonviolent protest is essential
