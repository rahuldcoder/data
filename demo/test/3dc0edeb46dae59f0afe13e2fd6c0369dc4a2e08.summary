@entity0 , @entity1 nearly 12 million parents in the @entity4 currently are raising kids on their own			1
when single parents face a devastating illness such as cancer , everyday needs like cleaning and cooking can become a struggle			1
@entity13 saw the need firsthand , when her childhood friend faced that situation			1
" making ends meet is insurmountable , " said @entity17			1
" there are so many doctors ' appointments , copays , surgeries , prescriptions			1
and then the inability to work -- any savings that there may have been is gone very quickly			1
" she did all she could to help			1
after her friend passed away , @entity17 helped start a nonprofit dedicated to assisting others in similar circumstances			1
since 2006 , @entity32 has provided practical , financial and emotional support to more than 300 parents in the @entity0 area			1
do you know a hero ? nominations are open for @entity40 2015 @entity41 , 48 , was a newly single mom when she was diagnosed with stage - 4 breast cancer			1
@entity17 ' group pitched in to help , so @entity44 could spend more time with her daughter @entity46 , now 10			1
" when you ca n't really do much and you 're looking at the dirt on the floor , it 's one more level of stress , " she said			1
" you have these people that come in , that do n't know you , and ' you 're going to help me with cleaning my house ? ' " " @entity32 has actually changed my whole outlook			1
they care about you , and they 're demonstrating their love through their actions			1
" i sat down with @entity62 to ask her about her work			2
below is an edited version of our conversation			2
@entity2 : tell me about the woman who inspired your work			2
@entity72 : i grew up with a girl named @entity74 who was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 30			1
she was a single mother of four children and i was a young mom with two kids			1
you just want to be there to watch them grow up			2
paying the bills , cleaning her home , making dinner for her kids -- all of that became a real struggle			2
i wanted to make things as easy as possible for her			2
so when i would go to the store , i 'd grab an extra @entity94 and extra toilet paper			2
when i would make my meals for my family , i would double it and bring a meal over to her house			2
once i helped with an electric bill			2
i just tried to do those little things that i hoped would relieve her of some stress			2
about six months after she passed , we got to thinking she could n't have been the only one			2
there were other people like her that needed help			2
and that 's how @entity32 was born			0
@entity2 : i 'd imagine that many people have n't thought about the struggles of being a single parent with cancer			1
how are you able to help ? @entity72 : we focus on day - to - day support -- financial assistance , housecleaning , prepared meals , supplies for the home , kids ' events			0
it 's that old - fashioned mentality of neighbors helping neighbors			0
who does n't like a clean house that they did n't have to clean themselves ? we have a team of volunteers that have all been background - checked and they sweep , mop , clean the bathrooms			0
we even have a couple of volunteers who go way above and beyond and will do laundry and fold clothes			0
and so , our parents can come home from chemo , sit on the couch and read a book with their child without having to worry about , " ugh , the bathroom needs to be cleaned			1
" it 's just to allow them to focus on what 's important , which is their health and their family			0
@entity2 : is this work hard for you sometimes , on a personal level ? @entity72 : about 80 % of the parents we support are stage 4 , which means that battling cancer is their full - time job			1
they will not go back to work and for the rest of their lives , they 'll be in treatment			0
i 've had bouts when a certain mom has passed where i did n't get out of bed for two weeks			0
and i thought , " why am i doing this ? " but then i come back and remember why			0
and so , while @entity74 is and always will be our inspiration , there are now so many others that are just as inspirational			0
they 're why i keep doing what i do			0
@entity2 : we should note that name of the organization is no longer entirely accurate			0
@entity72 : we 're not just about moms -- we have dads , too ! not a lot , but if you are a single parent , you need the support			1
they tend to even get a little special treatment			0
everybody 's like , " oh , there 's a dad here			0
" and so they give them lots of hugs and pay a lot of attention to them			0
@entity2 : it 's such a serious subject , but your group seems to have a very fun vibe			0
@entity72 : we 're very social ! once a month , all of our families come to pick up their supplies			0
we do crafts with the kids , snacks and have a good time			0
we like having any event because cancer sucks , and there 's not a lot of happy that goes with that			1
but life does still go on , so it 's really important that these families can just de-stress and have fun			0
no one can understand what they 're going through like another single parent with cancer			1
so giving them the opportunity to meet and support each other is very powerful			0
cancer can be so defeating			1
it 's an ugly word and it 's a sad word			0
and so , it 's my hope that @entity32 can bring joy and say to cancer , " you ca n't defeat us			1
we are still going to be strong and we 're going to celebrate life			0
and you ca n't take that away from us			0
