we want our killers to be kind			2
to walk into court and show remorse , tell us that they are really nice people who only did it because they feared for their lives , or they were temporarily insane			2
even though those things may not be true , too often they are accepted as legitimate excuses for murder			0
well , @entity13 , the former @entity12 tight end and now convicted murderer , made none of those excuses			1
he walked into court with an air of bravado , his head held high like the $ 40 million , @entity22 superstar he was just a couple of years ago			1
several times he was even caught winking at his fiancee , @entity24 , during the trial			0
and we did n't like his swagger			0
@entity13 did n't offer a plausible alibi			1
he did n't look ashamed or remorseful			0
his own attorney , @entity29 , admitted that @entity13 " witnessed " the killing of @entity33 , " committed by somebody he knew , " but said his client did not commit the crime			1
even before the guilty verdict came down wednesday , for many -- at least those covering the trial -- audacity seemed to be the defendant 's biggest crime			2
" the arrogance of @entity13 , " a @entity43 headline accused			1
i do n't get it			0
what does it matter that @entity13 was arrogant in court , or walked with too much swagger , or even smiled at his girl ? like it or not , that is who he is			1
the evidence is what matters			0
and for once , this time it appears the jury carefully considered the damning mountain of circumstantial evidence against this defendant and came to the right decision : guilty of first - degree murder in the 2013 slaying of @entity33			1
@entity13 , 25 , was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole			1
he was also found guilty of unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition			2
it was the right decision			0
still , it 's hard not to feel sadness over such a senseless waste of life for both @entity33 and now @entity13 , who were once friends			1
football was the best thing @entity13 ever had , especially after he father died suddenly after a routine hernia surgery in 2006			1
after that his life got complicated			2
at 17 , @entity13 went off to the @entity82 and seemed headed for greatness			1
there he won the @entity85 as the nation 's best tight end and led the team in receiving during its 2009 @entity90 win			0
but off the field , his life was to beginning to unravel			2
@entity92 started : bar fights , reports of marijuana use and failed drug tests			0
he was even questioned in relation to a shooting after a fight at a @entity101 , @entity102 , nightclub			0
by the time he was drafted in 2010 by the @entity12 , @entity13 had already been labeled a " troubled player			1
" but neither the @entity12 nor the @entity22 has anything to be ashamed of in how they handled the @entity13 case			1
they did everything right this time			0
hours after @entity13 was charged with murder , he was let go from the team			2
and his coaches did n't spend any time trying to convince the public that their star tight end was a decent , family - loving guy , as the league has done too many times in the past when its players got in trouble			2
there 's no reason to second - guess what went wrong , to ask " how could a star nfler be a murderer ? " the @entity22 for the most part does a great job vetting its players , and certainly @entity13 is an anomaly in the league , where despite the ugly headlines , the overwhelming majority of players are upstanding , law - abiding citizens			1
and @entity12 bashers ( me included ) would be mistaken to try to find fault with the team for drafting @entity13 despite his troubled past			1
no one really knows what evil lurks in the hearts of others , even those closest to us			0
not the mothers whose sons go off and commit schoolyard killing sprees , or wives whose husbands gun down innocent people , and certainly not employers who are mostly concerned about performance on the job			0
there was no way to predict @entity13 would end up a murderer			2
he was a guy who had all the talent and opportunity in the world , but he still went wrong			0
@entity13 himself may have explained it best as he was being taken out of the courtroom : according to a law enforcement source close to the case , @entity13 told officers escorting him , " ' @entity164 , i 'm going to miss you guys			1
... i do n't need any luck any more			0
' he gave you the impression , ' it 's kinda like no big deal			0
... it is what it is			0

@entity177 : jury right to find @entity13 guilty , but the waste of life for player and his victim is *tragic*
she says @entity22 , @entity12 knew his troubled past , but could not have predicted his *actions* , and both handled case well
