is there anything laser ca n't do ? from cutting diamonds to preserving endangered sites , all the way to building terrifying weapons and turning your eyes from brown to blue , there is apparently no end to the list of applications for laser			2
@entity17 physicist @entity16 is working on yet another impressive addition to that list : using focused laser beams to affect the weather			1
it sounds like black magic , but it 's actually a cleaner version of cloud seeding , a form of weather modification that has been used for several years -- most famously by @entity27 in preparation for the @entity29 , when they launched rockets to seed the clouds and prevent rainfall during the opening ceremony			1
but it 's hard to tell how effective cloud seeding actually is , and it involves the spraying of chemicals into the atmosphere , something which it surely does n't need			2
laser is therefore a completely clean alternative to traditional cloud seeding : it 's light , and nothing but light			0
how does laser actually affect the weather ? just like cloud seeding , it can create new clouds where there are none , by inducing condensation : naturally occurring water vapor is condensed into droplets , and ice crystals form , mimicking the natural process that creates clouds			1
that way , rainfall can be triggered to " empty " the atmosphere and increase the potential of dry weather later on : " we did it on a laboratory scale , we can already create clouds , but not on a macroscopic scale , so you do n't see a big cloud coming out because the laser is not powerful enough and because of a lot of technical parameters that we ca n't yet control , " professor @entity16 told @entity0 's @entity60			1
that is not to say that the laser he 's tested is n't powerful : at one terawatt , it has the same energy produced by all the nuclear power plants on @entity78 : " of course , it does n't last very long , " @entity16 said			1
the technology is still in its infancy then , but once it 's perfected , it could help us modulate the weather in areas of high contrast , such as @entity84 or @entity85 , where flooding and droughts occur in extreme vicinity			2
through lasers , those effects could be smoothed to have less rain in flooding - prone areas and more rain in drought - prone areas : " you can transport the water to a different location , " @entity16 said			1
laser seeding can make more than clouds : it can also trigger lightning			0
" we also showed that it 's possible to trigger lightning in clouds , within clouds , but not to the ground , yet			0
" recent tests have shown promise : " a few years ago , in @entity106 , we moved our big mobile terawatt laser to the top of a mountain and we shot it up into the atmosphere , trying to trigger lightning			0
we did n't , but we could see some small discharge , lightning , within the cloud			0
you know , 90 per cent of the lightning discharge are intra-cloud , not against the @entity78			0
so , we are still working on that , but there is hope			0
" controlling lightning , or facilitating its discharge in a desired location , would help reduce the costs associated with lightning damage -- they run into the billions of dollars each year , adding to thousands of people injured or killed by lightning strikes			0
affecting the weather could also turn out to be one of our best bets at limiting the impact of climate change			1
professor @entity16 reckons lasers could be used to " repair " the weather , reducing the occurrence of hurricanes , thunderstorms , flooding , and drought			1
but his laser technology can look way beyond the clouds : " there are potential applications in the biomedical field : by changing the color of the laser , we could identify and selectively kill cancer cells , with little or no collateral damage			0
" yet another potential application to add to that list : " every time you think you have done everything you can with lasers , something new comes up : it 's quite amazing			2

@entity17 professor @entity16 is *pioneering* the use of lasers to affect the weather
he *suggests* lasers could also be used to limit the impact of climate change
