@entity2 a @entity1 detective apologized friday for an angry exchange with an uber driver that was caught on video and landed him on modified assignment			1
i sincerely apologize , " @entity9 told @entity11 's @entity10			1
@entity9 , an @entity1 detective assigned to the @entity13 's @entity12 with top - secret security clearance , faces suspension , reassignment or loss of his clearance after the video of the altercation went viral			1
" i was just angry , at that moment , for that exchange			2
" if the conversation initially went differently , we probably would have shook hands at the end of that encounter			1
" the altercation began monday when the @entity29 driver gestured to a detective in an unmarked car to use his blinker after he was allegedly attempting to park without using it , according to @entity34 , a passenger in the car who uploaded the video to @entity37			1
the video picks up seconds after the detective began yelling at the driver and mocking his accent , and also shows the unmarked car with lights flashing pulled over behind the @entity29 car			1
in the video , the detective tells the driver he has committed " three traffic and law violations " and then becomes irate and uses expletives toward the comparably calm driver			1
a visibly upset police commissioner @entity50 on wednesday said the detective was placed on modified assignment pending an investigation			1
" no good cop can watch that without a wince , " he told reporters			2
" as all good cops know ... the officer made their jobs a little bit harder			2
that kind of anger like that is unacceptable in any encounter ; discourtesy like that and language like that is unacceptable			2
that officer 's behavior reflected poorly on everyone who wears our uniform			2
" @entity9 also apologized to the police commissioner , saying " he 's doing a lot of good work to strengthen community relations in the city and i set that back			2
i would work , personally work to fix that			2
" " you ca n't judge three minutes of a tape involving me and me alone as indication that that 's the kind of practice of the @entity1 , " he added			1
@entity50 , who said the detective was on duty at the time , issued an apology to the driver and passengers			1
mayor @entity94 told reporters at an unrelated news conference that he had not seen the video			0
" there 's just no place for any public servant to use discriminatory or negative language , " he said			0
" obviously , our police play a particularly sensitive role and need to show respect for all people			0
" in a statement , @entity107 , president of the @entity108 , called the officer " a person of good character and an excellent detective " who " should not be judged by one isolated incident			2
" " i am not trying to minimize the significance of what occurred , " @entity107 said			0
" i am simply pointing out that cops are just like everyone else			0
they have families , friends and other things going on in their lives , too , that may affect their behavior at times			0
there is no disputing that we are held to a higher standard , that is why this incident is so newsworthy			0
" in the video , after the detective steps back to his car , the @entity29 driver , who moved to @entity135 less than two years ago , turns to the passenger and thanks him for recording the video			1
that 's really inappropriate , " the passenger tells the driver			1
" listen , it 's not your fault			0
he should n't be slamming your car door , throwing things around			0
he does n't have a right to open your door			0
" when the detective comes back , he is irate and does n't allow the driver to speak			1
" i do n't care what you have to say , people are allowed to park their cars on the side of the street without your interference , " the detective tells the driver			1
" i do n't know where you 're coming from , where you think it 's appropriate in doing that			0
that 's the way it works			0
" " i 've got news for you , " the detective says , " the only reason you 're not in handcuffs and going to jail and getting summons in the precinct is because i have things to do			2
that 's the only reason that 's not happening			0
because this is n't important enough for me			0
you 're not important enough			0
do n't ever do that again			0
" the @entity1 said the @entity181 is investigating the incident			1
" the behavior in the video is wrong and unacceptable and we appreciate the @entity1 investigating the incident			1
we are in touch with our driver - partner who was subjected to this terrible experience and will continue to provide any support he needs , " @entity29 said tuesday			1
@entity34 met wednesday with an investigator from the @entity191 , according to board spokeswoman @entity192			0
the investigator is attempting to interview the driver as well as the police officer			2
the findings will be presented to the board , which will make an official determination on whether misconduct was committed , @entity192 said			0
the board will either refer the decision to the @entity1 with a disciplinary recommendation , or decide to bring up the officer on administrative charges , with the decision presented to the police commissioner			1
