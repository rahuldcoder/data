looting , fires and violence descended on @entity3			1
like most who know and love that city , i was heartbroken			1
i was once a cop in @entity3			1
police , trying to save their city last weekend , were blamed both for doing too little and for doing too much			1
the ghetto , and i 'm talking class and not race , was on full display by monday			1
the whole nation saw beautiful @entity3 at its worst			1
the protests started in response to the death of @entity17 in police hands			1
we still do n't know what happened to @entity17			2
maybe the investigation should be going faster			2
but maybe rushing the investigation would compromise prosecution			2
( and forced testimony ca n't be used in prosecution ; police officers too have constitutional rights as criminal defendants			1
) i do n't know			2
here 's the thing : police officers who were n't there do n't know what happened to @entity17			1
if there are criminally guilty cops , police have no problem with justice			1
but those who caused destruction on monday had little , if anything , to do with @entity17 protests			0
they were , as the mayor put it , thugs			0
call them what you will , normally what happens in the hood stays in the hood			0
those who cut fire hoses and burned down homes and businesses ? police deal with them every day , literally			1
those criminals did n't just appear on monday , and they wo n't be gone tomorrow			0
they live there , without jobs , education , mainstream social skills , or hope			0
they do n't come from stable families			0
they do n't go to church			0
most violent criminals are actively or passively involved in the drug trade			0
in @entity3 this year -- just like last year and just like next year -- police will arrest tens of thousands of poor black men , mostly on drug charges			1
from the same pool , 200 will be shot and killed			0
another 200 will do the killing			0
these are communities , like the @entity3 's @entity78 , in which more than 10 % of men are murdered			1
if all of @entity82 had homicide levels found in parts of @entity3 , there would be over 300,000 murders per year ( as opposed to the still shamefully high 12,000 homicides in @entity82 )			1
and yet some continue to think of police as the main problem rather than part of the solution			1
but @entity3 is not @entity92			1
the police department is 50 % non-white			1
so is the police commissioner			1
the city is 65 % @entity97			1
so imagine you 're a young white cop , as i was , in a rough neighborhood			0
a nice retired @entity102 - @entity82 gentleman calls 911 because the kids in front of his house , also black , are rowdy , breaking bottles , selling drugs , and otherwise being disrespectful			1
just out of the police academy , i pulled up to countless of these situations			1
what to do ? usually i stopped , stared , and they moved on			0
sometimes i would get out of my car			0
but i should n't have to			0
we all played by the same rules			0
sometimes i would ask politely			0
sometimes i had to order rudely			0
sometimes i would ask for @entity117			0
sometimes i would frisk , search , or arrest			0
that 's what cops do			2
that 's what i did			0
ultimately police are in a no - win situation			1
and when things go wrong , they go wrong fast			0
sometimes -- not very often -- it 's the police officer 's fault			2
but even if there were no racist or brutal cops -- if every cop were a polite , fit , college - educated , bilingual , @entity102 - @entity82 gentleman or woman -- this would n't solve the greater problems of the ghetto or even police abuse			1
police abuse has less to do with race than poverty and class			1
and police will never solve the problems of absent parents , mass incarceration , or a violence culture centered around the economics of drug prohibition			2
even so , rather than face up to our problems , we calls for the cops to do something , anything			2
yes , bad cops need to be punished			2
but it 's too easy to blame police for all our problems			2
problems police did not cause and can not solve			2
and then when a cop makes a mistake , as one inevitably will , we jump on all police with a confident smugness and unbecoming glee			2
the problems in policing mirror the problems of society			0
we can and should improve police			2
the best way to do that is to improve society			0
true justice requires us to look both inward for blame and outward to the suffering around us			0
the worst thing we could do is nothing at all .			0

@entity186 : when man died in police custody , many *unfairly* blamed all @entity3 cops . but cops are in a no - win situation
he says those who *trashed* city are part of larger societal woes of poverty and class . in just blaming cops , we ignore *source* of strife
