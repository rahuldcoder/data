@entity2 @entity0 and her husband , @entity3 , were standing near the finish line on the day of the @entity5			1
her feet were sore from wearing 4.5 - inch heels			1
still , they walked to @entity9 to watch the runners			1
" we were so in love and happy together , " she told a federal jury wednesday			1
it was the second day the @entity2 jury heard a procession of heartbreaking loss -- the survivors and families of those killed when twin bombs planted by the pair of brothers named @entity24 exploded near the finish line			1
the jury must decide whether bomber @entity24 , 21 , should live or die for what he has done			1
@entity0 and @entity3 , who had just returned from a tour in @entity29 with the @entity30 , were steps away from the explosion near the @entity33			1
she recalled the force of the blast that killed three people and injured over 200 that april day in 2013			1
she knew right away it was a terrorist attack			1
screams and heavy smoke filled the air			1
she could n't hear her own screams			1
she thought she was dead			1
when her husband , who also was injured , lifted her leg , he too let out a scream			1
she said she thought he was in shock			1
she rolled over onto her stomach and crawled over broken glass , shredding her arms			1
she dragged herself to the @entity33			1
" i saw all five of my toes , but i saw a lot of blood , " she said			1
" i did n't see my ankle			1
" a ballroom dancer , @entity0 ' left leg would later be amputated below the knee			1
inside the forum , @entity0 begged for whiskey			2
" i just wanted the pain to go away			2

" when someone removed @entity3 's shoe , an artery was spurting blood			1
his face got whiter and whiter , she said			2
she thought he was dead			2
at a hospital , she called her parents on her cellphone			2
she told them she was in a terrorist attack			2
" i do n't think i have a left foot anymore , " she told her father			2
" i 'm in really bad shape and i really need to talk to you because this might be it			2
" her father told her he was driving and it was illegal to pull over			2
" i do n't care if it 's illegal			1
i need to talk to you because these might be our last words			2
i said i was in a terrorist attack at the @entity84 and @entity3 is dead and this might be it for me			2
" @entity0 told the jury that , at the @entity33 , her husband kept telling her he was sorry			2

moments before , he has two fingers up , forming what @entity118 called a " v sign , " before raising his middle finger			2
