the @entity1 2 , the experimental plane attempting to fly around the world without using a drop of fuel , has been grounded by the weather in @entity7			1
what was supposed to be an overnight pit stop in the southwestern city of @entity11 has now stretched into a two - and - a - half week stay			2
it 's an unexpected layover that is testing the patience of the pilots and more than 60 team members , just a quarter of the way along a journey that will cover some 35,000 kilometers ( 21,748 miles ) over five months			2
" you can believe that your will can influence the weather , " says pilot @entity19 , who comes from a long family line of explorers			2
but " then you 'll be really disappointed because it does n't work			2
" or you just know that it 's an adventure you do with the forces of nature			2
" @entity19 , along with @entity30 , a @entity31 engineer , are taking turns flying the single - seater aircraft , which took off from @entity34 on march 9 and has successfully flown through @entity35 , @entity36 , and @entity37			2
there is much at stake			2
their mission , which the pilots say is aimed at proving the power of renewable energy , and inspiring innovation , has been 12 years in the making			1
in many ways , it has become @entity19 and @entity30 's raison d'etre			0
but so far , the @entity1 2 has been spending a lot of time on the ground			1
the latest setback came when a thursday takeoff was canceled , because the cross winds in @entity57 , the plane 's destination , were forecast to be too strong around its expected landing time			1
because of its weight , at just 2,300 kilograms -- about the same as a large suv -- the aircraft needs near perfect weather conditions , including cross winds of less than 4 knots , or about 7 kilometers an hour , in order to fly			0
while the team is used to waiting , they are clearly eager to move on			0
" our boss is the sun , " says @entity1 spokeswoman @entity72			1
@entity72 says there may be a tiny window ahead , with the next possible departure from @entity11 on tuesday			0
" it 's not good before , and the days after do n't look very clear			0
" even with the delay , @entity72 says , the plane technically is n't behind schedule			1
that 's because the team needs to wait until the end of the month for the northern hemisphere days to get longer , before the plane can venture across the @entity87 to @entity88			1
with more than 17,000 solar cells along the tops of its wings and fuselage , the @entity1 2 stores up energy during the day , in order to power the motors that carry it through the night , typically at speeds no faster than a car on a highway			1
inside a specially constructed tent at the end of the runway at @entity105 , a skeleton team of less than a dozen people works to complete the day 's tasks			0
the rest of the crew has been waiting for weeks in @entity57			0
even with the extended stay , no time is wasted			0
@entity19 spends a few hours of the afternoon in the cockpit , training to prepare for the @entity1 's crossings over the @entity87 and @entity116 , what the team calls " the moment of truth			1
" the plane will then return to @entity34 , where it had taken off			1
nearby , two technicians repair a couple of the flight computers , which display critical information in the cockpit , punching extra holes in their casings so they do n't overheat			0
meanwhile , @entity30 has returned to @entity31 to rest and get medical treatment for a migraine and a skin condition			0
the team expects him back in @entity7 early next week			1
@entity30 is still scheduled to fly first leg of the @entity87 crossing , which could last up to five days and nights			0
" the airplane is ready			0
the mission control center is ready			0
we 've been waiting for that moment since so long , " says @entity19			0
@entity30 and @entity19 , who piloted an earlier version of the plane across the @entity141 in 2013 , are no strangers to adventure			1
@entity30 is a former fighter pilot , and @entity19 was part of the first team to circumnavigate the earth nonstop in a balloon in 1999 .			1
