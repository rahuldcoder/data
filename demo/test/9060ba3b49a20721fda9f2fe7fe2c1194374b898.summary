@entity0 , my good friend and co-author who got a @entity4 in economics , once helped to run an experiment involving patients undergoing colonoscopies			0
one group received a mildly pleasurable experience at the end of the procedure ; the other group , which experienced the same type of colonoscopy , did not			0
it turns out that the group for whom things ended well had significantly more positive recollections of the whole affair from its beginning			0
the psychology of it is simple to understand : happy endings matter			1
even an unpleasant experience can lead to happy memories in hindsight if it ends well			1
let 's just say that when it comes to taxes for the average @entity33 , " stuff " happens ( keeping the colonoscopy metaphor running ) , paycheck to tax - reduced paycheck			1
but recent statistics suggest that 8 out of 10 @entity33 taxpayers get a refund when they file their taxes , and the average amount is close to $ 3000			1
that pays for a lot of stuff			0
to make the good news even better , tax filing has gotten rather simple for most people , with various software and service providers offering to do the dreaded paperwork for free			2
no filing headaches and a check to boot			0
what 's not to like ? the fact of the matter is there is plenty not to like when it comes to the @entity33 tax system			1
for example , the laws are biased against two - worker marriages ; taxes go up when two relatively equal earners marry , as the rate brackets for couples are less than double that for single filers			2
taxes are also overly complex and essentially optional for the truly rich , who make their wealth off of their existing wealth , the largely untaxed returns from capital , rather than by getting ordinary paychecks like most of us			0
but now is not the time to explain such serious matters ; the people are too busy spending their refunds			0
the once dreaded @entity82 has become a happy spending spree for most @entity33			1
this state of short - term bliss follows from some deep trends in our tax laws			1
in brief , the @entity33 income tax system is increasingly a wage tax , with limited taxes on capital ( what the rich have ) and limited deductions for most of us			1
for example , 3 out of 4 @entity33 using a standard deduction get no break for their charitable contributions			1
all of this has been hashed and rehashed by politicians , professors and pundits			0
but who has time for that ? let 's go to our television sets and check out the commercials			2
one clever spot ran during the recent @entity113 , suggesting that the @entity114 -- a tax revolt -- could have been averted with free online filing , which the sponsor was eager to provide			2
filling out 1040s was part of what made the income tax so odious for the masses for such a long time -- who does n't remember our parents fretting over shoeboxes of receipts sometime in april , the cruelest month ? now as @entity82 approaches , we are flooded with advertisements about @entity33 getting its billions back , without even having to pay to prepare the forms			1
we get paid to play ! here is the happy ending that @entity0 and others have shown can mitigate the memories of unpleasantness past			2
the simple fact is that a simple tax is also rather simple to administer			2
service providers kindly offer to help out the masses of befuddled @entity33			1
of course , these kind souls want their happy endings too			2
they are betting that once the large refunds become obvious to their customers , the grateful taxpayers - turned - consumers will happily purchase add - on services , such as " audit protection insurance , " or perhaps deposit the money in financial accounts managed by the provider			0
just as lottery winners notoriously go on impulsive spending sprees , the " found money " of tax returns can finance many nice purchases			0
of course , there are still those annoying matters of the deep unfairness of the tax laws , biased against modern families and wage earners , and in favor of the rich living off capital			1
no real bother -- stuff happens			0
let others fret about fairness			0
as long as our taxpaying or colon procedures end with a smile -- or a check -- who has time to dwell on the bad stuff that came before ?			0

@entity179 : there 's a *fundamental* unfairness to @entity33 tax laws
but @entity33 do n't care because most of us get a refund on @entity82 , and that makes us happy
