it 's the kind of thing you see in movies , like @entity6 's role in " @entity7 " or @entity9 's " @entity8			1
" but , in real life , it 's hard to swallow the idea of a single person being stranded at sea for days , weeks , if not months and somehow living to talk about it			1
miracles do happen , though , and not just in @entity17			1
we 're not talking about people who float aimlessly or run aground after running out of gas or being let down by faltering winds only to be picked up a few hours later by the @entity22			2
much rarer are cases in which individuals become lost at sea long enough that they run out of whatever food and drinking water they 'd brought aboard , if any			1
in order to survive , they ca n't bank on technology or the proximity of a nearby city , town or boat -- but instead must rely on ingenuity , resourcefulness and luck			2
it 's hard to say how many of these types of stories end sadly , with a sailor dying at sea , except that it is a much higher number than those that end in rescues			1
such happy endings do occur -- given what rescue agencies have reported and assuming you believe what any sole survivor says , a big qualifier since typically no one else can prove or refute their accounts			1
below are a few recent examples : @entity60 says that he set off on his 35 - foot sailboat from @entity62 in late january			1
he headed into the @entity63 looking for a good spot to catch fish			2
and then everything -- his boat , his life -- turned upside down			2
rescued man says he is ' utterly thankful ' not only did his boat capsize , but its mast broke , @entity60 said			1
and so , too , did his shoulder			2
he bought time by rationing water , then collecting fresh water in a bucket			2
as to food , @entity60 says he used laundry to trap and scoop up fish			2
and he rigged a makeshift mast and sail			2
but , @entity60 said , " it took so long			2
" his sailboat would capsize two more times before crew members on a @entity88 - flagged container ship , the @entity89 , spotted @entity60 about 200 miles off the @entity91 coast on thursday			2
after their reunion , his father greeted him with a hug and an admission every parent dreads			2
" i thought i lost you			2
" @entity99 says his journey began in @entity101 , a port on @entity103 's @entity102 , in late 2012			1
the exact date is up for debate -- he says he set off in december , locals say it was november			2
but what 's not in doubt is that , after he left , he disappeared			2
that 's when @entity99 interacted with humans once again , thousands of miles away on a remote atoll in the @entity113			1
@entity114 recounts how he survived over a year adrift in @entity102 what was supposed to be a one - day trip , he says , turned into an arduous odyssey across the @entity118 , one that saw him lose his fishing companion and tested his will and ability to survive			1
his nightmare began when winds blew the pair off course			2
then a storm hit causing their boat , which was about three people long and one wide , to lose its engine and use of its radio communication and gps systems			2
four weeks in , @entity99 said his partner -- 23 - year - old @entity134 , according to the boat 's owner -- died because he refused to eat raw birds			1
the days , weeks and months ran together after that			1
@entity99 says he drank rainwater and , when there was n't any available , his own urine			0
then , after 13 or 14 months adrift , he and his small , heavily damaged boat arrived on the @entity144 , about a 22 - hour boat ride from the @entity113 capital of @entity147			1
the atoll has one phone line , no internet service and a few residents , two of whom @entity99 spotted and shouted to after spending a night in the woods			0
the @entity156 native told @entity1 that his faith in @entity158 helped him survive			1
" i thought , ' i am going to get out , " he said			0
" get out , get out , get out			0
" some in their late 60s might relax in their retirement , reining it in a few notches as life slows down			0
and if you live in @entity167 , there 's even more reason to take it easy			0
the thing is : @entity170 is n't one of those people			0
the sea is both his life and livelihood , his son , @entity173 , told @entity1			1
and he 's tough , with his son jokingly comparing him to @entity178			0
still , even the hardiest fishermen would have been tested by what @entity170 went through after setting off around last @entity182 solo from the @entity184 island of @entity185			0
son vindicated as father rescued after 12 days at sea after bad weather hit , @entity170 told @entity1 affiliate @entity192 / @entity191 that his 25 - foot sailboat went " backwards all night long			1
" at one point , a huge wave struck -- pushing his mast into the water and him as well			0
the 67 - year - old used a rope to pull himself back in			1
but his boat could n't be rescued so easily , leaving him at the mercy of the current			1
a distress call went out , prompting a search that would cover 12,000 square miles			0
when a @entity22 official told him the search was being called off december 1 , @entity205 responded , " i do n't feel like he 's dead			0
i do n't feel it			0
twelve days after that first distress call , @entity170 was picked up about 64 miles ( 103 kilometers ) south of @entity210 " weak , hungry and dehydrated " and -- most importantly -- alive			1
the veteran fisherman headed back to shore only after getting assurances his damaged boat would come with him			0
in february 2012 , two friends asked 18 - year - old @entity215 whether he wanted to tag along on an overnight fishing expedition			1
he said yes , and the three set off from the @entity220 town of @entity221 on a small boat , @entity215 's mother , @entity217 , recalled			0
things started out well , by all accounts			0
the three caught plenty of fish			0
then , their boat 's engine died without warning			0
and , with no tools and scant navigational experience , the trio did n't know what to do , according to @entity215 's mother			0
mother calls @entity220 teen 's return ' a miracle ' @entity240 ate raw fish and drank rainwater as currents swept his boat , the @entity245 , further and further from the coast and into the @entity118			0
somewhere along the way , his two companions died			0
it 's not clear exactly how , with @entity251 rear			0
adm. @entity252 saying @entity215 threw their bodies into the sea " because they had become badly decomposed			1
" some 26 days after and nearly 600 miles away from where the journey began , fishermen spotted the tiny vessel north of the @entity261			1
the @entity251 navy came in and picked up the teenage survivor , who 'd lost 20 pounds and showed " severe signs of dehydration and lack of nutrition , " according to @entity252			1
he returned home to loved ones eager to embrace him , but mindful of giving him time to process the ordeal			0
" for us , this is an opportunity to get closer as a family , " his mother said by phone , " to be more understanding and loving			0
" sometimes one does n't have to be in the ocean for weeks to have his or her life imperiled			0
sometimes people do n't have to set off by boat to have the sea challenge them to the end			1
for proof , look no further than @entity287			0
60 - year - old man waves red flag to alert rescuers he was at home on march 11 , 2011 , when a massive 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck 231 miles northeast of @entity294			1
a devastating tsunami followed , its 30 - foot waves ravaging cities and towns and damaging several nuclear reactors			1
by the time it had run the course , nearly 16,000 people were dead			0
it 's a miracle @entity304 was n't one of them			0
shortly after the quake , he and his wife had gone to collect some belongings when the tsunami slammed their hometown of @entity313			1
his home was one of the tens of thousands destroyed by the the huge , powerful tsunami wave			1
" i was saved by holding onto the roof , " the 60 - year - old said , according to @entity318			1
" but my wife was swept away			0
' more than two days later , video showed @entity304 barely visible amid heaps of splintered wood , shattered homes and other debris floating more than nine miles ( 15 kilometers ) out to sea			1
he was waving a self - made red flag			0
after being spotted by crew aboard a @entity330 destroyer and picked up in a smaller rescue boat , he took a drink offered to him and burst into tears , @entity318 reported			0
@entity304 told his rescuers , " i thought today was the last day of my life			0
