" twelve people were arrested , police commissioner @entity26 said			1
" we continue to have a few isolated pockets of individuals causing disturbances			0

" vandals broke and damaged storefront windows and trashed one @entity47 , police said			2

the skirmishes followed a planned demonstration over how police handled the arrest of @entity4 , a 25 - year - old @entity0 man who suffered a spinal injury at some point after he was detained by police on april 12			1
he died a week later			0
the numbers of protesters dissipated substantially just before sunset , though some people were still walking in the streets near @entity70 at @entity71 , causing some traffic problems			1

when demonstrators got to the stadium , tensions escalated and some people threw what appeared to be water bottles and other objects at the cops , who wore helmets and stood behind metal barricades			1
fans who were arriving to watch the hometown @entity99 play the @entity101 were having trouble finding ways to the entrance gates			2
the @entity99 won the game 5 - 4 in extra innings			0
for a time it appeared that fans would be held inside the ballpark until the demonstration quieted , but the gates were opened before the contest was over			2

" the police department used @entity116 to update the public on the progress of the march			2
at @entity75 , speakers demanded justice for the @entity4 family and an end to what they called police brutality against black suspects			1
at least one protest organizer had promised in advance that the event would be big enough to shut down the city , but while many people turned out and walked , the major disruption was only to traffic on a few streets			2

" police say five of the six officers involved in the arrest have provided statements to investigators			2
the sixth officer has invoked his right to refuse to answer questions , @entity26 said			0
