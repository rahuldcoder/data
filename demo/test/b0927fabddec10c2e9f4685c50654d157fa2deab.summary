@entity1 will sign a final nuclear agreement only if economic sanctions against the nation are removed on the first day of the deal 's implementation , president @entity0 said thursday			1
ayatollah @entity8 , the @entity9 's supreme leader , meanwhile , told state - run media outlets he is neither in favor nor against the proposed deal because it is n't final , and he 's not certain it will become binding because he has " never been optimistic about negotiations with the @entity16 " six world powers and @entity1 reached a preliminary deal last week that aims to limit @entity20 's nuclear program in exchange for lifting economic sanctions			1
the @entity16 , however , has stressed that if a final deal is reached with @entity1 , the removal of any sanctions will come in phases			1
but work on the agreement is n't finished			0
negotiators from @entity1 and the @entity16 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 have until june 30 to come up with a final deal			1
@entity8 said he supports the negotiators , but in several not - so - subtle shots at the @entity16 , noted it is too soon to celebrate the proposed deal			1
" everything lies in the details , " @entity8 said in a thursday address , according to @entity41			0
" the other side , which is known for backpedaling on its commitments , may want to corner our country when it comes to the specifics			0
" what has been hashed out so far is no guarantee that the deal will become final , he said , and according to the @entity55 , the leader said he ca n't support or oppose the deal , especially when it 's possible " the other disloyal party intends to limit our country			2
" some have asked why @entity8 has n't taken a position on the talks , and the reason is simple , he said , according to @entity55 : " there is no need to take a position			0
officials say nothing has been done yet and that nothing is binding			0
i am neither in favor nor against it			0
" any final deal must " ensure the interests and dignity of the ( @entity1 ) nation , " he said , adding he will support an agreement that " will safeguard national interests and dignity			1
" he said he 'd rather see the agreement fail than make a deal that jeopardizes @entity1 's interests			1
" what has happened so far will neither guarantee the agreement itself nor its content			0
it will not even guarantee completion of the negotiations			0
therefore , it is meaningless to congratulate me or others about it , " he said			2
@entity0 said his government would not surrender to bullying , sanctions and threats , according to @entity41			1
" we will not sign any deal unless on the very first day of its implementation all economic sanctions against @entity1 are lifted all at once , " @entity0 said at a ceremony to mark @entity98 in @entity20			1
president @entity104 faces an uphill battle selling the deal to a skeptical @entity107 , which has threatened to impose new sanctions on @entity1			1
@entity16 energy secretary @entity109 , a nuclear physicist and negotiator with @entity1 , estimated it would take six months after a final deal is signed for the sanctions to be lifted			1
he told @entity2 's @entity114 that it was a " ballpark " figure contingent on a lot of work the @entity1 will have to do beforehand			2
" the core nuclear provisions must be satisfied ... the provisions that give us our confidence , " @entity109 said			0
he said it 's in the " hands of the @entity1 " to fulfill steps such as reducing stockpiles and lowering the number of operating centrifuges			2
" it will depend on their ability to execute those moves , " @entity109 said			0
asked if the @entity1 were aware of that time frame during the negotiations -- before @entity0 called for the immediate lifting of sanctions -- @entity109 said , " oh , yes , for sure			1
" the no. 3 @entity137 said a bill to ease any sanctions does not stand much of a chance in the @entity16 @entity142 or @entity143			1
" the sanctions that were put in place -- again , very bipartisan sanctions passed by @entity107 years ago that were effective -- the only way to get rid of them completely would be for @entity107 to vote to ease those sanctions , " rep. @entity144 of @entity145 said in a radio interview with @entity147 in @entity148 on wednesday			2
" we have n't had that vote			0
i do n't see that passing out of the @entity142			2
i do n't even think it would pass out of the @entity143 right now			2
" diplomats announced last week that they 'd come up with the framework for an agreement after a marathon stretch of late - night negotiations in @entity164 , @entity165			0
the framework includes the easing of @entity16 and @entity168 sanctions on @entity1 if it takes certain steps to curb its nuclear program			1
@entity1 would reduce its stockpile of low - enriched uranium by 98 % for 15 years and significantly scale back its number of installed centrifuges , according to the plan			2
in exchange , the @entity16 and the @entity177 would lift sanctions that have crippled the country 's economy			1
" it is a good deal , a deal that meets our core objectives , " @entity104 said after it was announced april 2			0
" this framework would cut off every pathway that @entity1 could take to develop a nuclear weapon			0
" it would include strict verification measures to make sure @entity1 complies , he said			0
the @entity16 and @entity1 have a long history of strained relations , which made the negotiations more significant			1
just two years ago , the two countries had not talked with each other officially in nearly four decades			0
@entity2 's @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 contributed to this report .			0

" it is meaningless to congratulate me or others " because deal not final , @entity206 says
