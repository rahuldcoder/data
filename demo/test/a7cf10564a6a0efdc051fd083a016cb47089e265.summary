i 've been in disaster management long enough to know that there is really no one right way to mark the anniversary of a tragic event			1
as the @entity10 runners begin and , hopefully , finish their exhausting run monday , the lingering memories of the 2013 marathon blasts will be seen and felt in all sorts of ways			1
more public safety officials throughout the route , a finish line area that prohibits large bags , @entity15 members in full uniform giving some sense of security -- those are the most obvious , visible changes			2
and there are less obvious ones too			2
with the luxury of some time and healing , the city has moved on			2
and that is a blessing			2
in the midst of that weeklong tragedy -- the bombings , the manhunt , the lockdown and eventual capture or killing of the @entity42 brothers -- we thought we knew what was going on			2
but we were too much in the midst of our own situational awareness , the fog of war			2
sometimes it takes years to determine what in fact occurred and to write a narrative that reflects a multitude of voices and opinions			1
that narrative is just forming , and it 's worth going back to highlight some of the more strategic lessons that came out of that week			2
as a former homeland security adviser for @entity58 , i was intimately involved with the marathon planning ; as a commentator for @entity1 , i saw the story evolve during that week			1
some of these lessons learned are informed by the luxury of time and hindsight , others by various after - action reports and assessments , and others by the trial of @entity42 , in which a jury found him guilty of multiple counts			1
on tuesday , the trial 's sentencing phase will begin , determining whether he will receive the death penalty			1
in national security circles , there is often a debate about whether the @entity82 judicial system is well equipped for terrorism trials			2
@entity84 , the argument goes , is different from traditional crimes , and our system of evidence and cross-examination and the promise of counsel are not appropriate to transnational threats			2
even if this argument were valid in some context -- where terrorists were picked up on battlegrounds abroad and evidence against them might be difficult to obtain -- the @entity10 trial made clear that the system does work			1
what was amazing about a trial filled with so much emotion is that it was relatively unemotional			1
defense attorneys challenged the witnesses			0
the defendant chose not to testify			0
its simplicity not only vindicated the capacity of our constitutional system to handle these cases , but also took the mythology ( maybe even the romanticism ) of terrorism out of the case			0
it rendered tsarnaev a common criminal			0
and that was a statement worth making			0
recent reports about the shootout in @entity127 that friday night in 2013 show a disorganized and often unnecessarily dangerous response during the manhunt			1
it is truly remarkable there were not more significant friendly fire casualties beyond the wounding of @entity58 transit police officer @entity134 as more and more police officials came to the town and failed to fall into place in what should ideally be a very delineated command structure			1
maybe it was adrenaline , maybe it was just the nature of the weapons			0
what is clear -- in @entity127 and in so many other police departments -- is that our police officers are not adequately trained for the kind of weapons that they have now			0
that is a dangerous gap , and too many police departments are failing to address it			0
we have a notion of " @entity155 " coming from the attacks and the city 's response			1
i never loved the term , mostly because it makes it seem that our ability to bounce back was because we have puritan stock and a kick - ass attitude			0
that is only partially true			0
we risk believing that responses to tragedy are simply a matter of personal reflection and a " keep calm " persona			0
i have come to believe that what united us as a city was based on the competency of the response			1
the quick decisions to move runners off @entity178 , the ability of police officers to seal the large crime zone and to utilize the military to do so , the pivot of public health officials from tending to blisters and dehydration to forming makeshift triage centers			0
it is worth remembering that not a single person of the hundreds who were transported to hospitals died ; the three fatalities occurred at the bombing site only			1
one part of the response that does n't get enough mention is the focus on family unification immediately after the attacks			1
runners had no access to phones , and often had no identification			0
family members of runners often did n't know where their loved ones were on the marathon route			1
first responders , in particular the @entity210 police and the @entity211 , focused on getting families back together again by moving runners and spectators to @entity216 , a few blocks from the finish line			0
once family members know that they are with loved ones , the trauma subsides			0
they often leave the scene , freeing up space and capacity so that public safety can focus on more immediate needs			0
crisis planning must continue to focus on the one aspect that will matter most to those in a disaster : is my family ok ? obviously , there is so much more to learn			1
could the bombing have been avoided ? what would have happened if the @entity236 had shared information it had on the @entity42 family with local police ? what if family and friends had alerted authorities to the growing radicalization of the brothers ? it 's " woulda , coulda , shoulda " but still essential			1
one of the reasons it is crucial to go back and draw these lessons is n't simply for blame , but to get better for the next time			1
analysis and criticism are necessary to make us stronger and more resilient			0
but do not believe that we are done learning			0
looking back can be risky ; it 's often called the " blinding clarity of hindsight " because everything looks so obvious in the rearview mirror			0
but i have no doubt that at future anniversaries , what we know today will be altered and reformed and a new narrative might be written			0
and maybe the best way to remember today is to commit to a constant willingness to learn from this tragedy in all the years ahead .			1

@entity10 takes place monday , two years after bombing , and sentencing phase of trial begins tuesday
@entity273 : it was n't the @entity277 ethic but good disaster response that kept the marathon bombing from being even worse
