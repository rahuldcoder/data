the last time @entity1 came to power in @entity3 , it was by force			1
this time it was by the ballot box			0
here are five reasons why one of the most fiercely - contested elections in the country 's history is so important			2
for the first time in @entity3 's history , the opposition defeated the ruling party in democratic elections			1
@entity1 , 72 , won @entity3 's presidential election , defeating incumbent @entity19 by about two million votes			1
@entity3 is significant because it is the biggest economy and most populous country in @entity23 ; it is also one of @entity23 's largest oil producers and is a major supplier of crude oil to the @entity28			1
this is n't @entity1 's first time leading @entity3 -- but it 's his first time in nearly 30 years			1
the reformed dictator is a @entity32 from @entity3 's poorer @entity33 , while @entity19 comes from a @entity35 and animist @entity34 that is rich with oil			1
@entity1 's win comes after a long history of military rule , coups and botched attempts at democracy in the country			1
many @entity3 told @entity4 that they saw president @entity19 as an ineffectual leader who was indecisive in dealing with the terror group @entity45 -- and weak on corruption			1
@entity1 , who was campaigning for the fourth time , capitalized on these weaknesses and some analysts believe that his military background was an advantage for him			2
@entity3 wanted a strong leader who could keep them safe from @entity45 's murderous raids -- and @entity1 also campaigned as a born - again democrat to allay fears about his strict military regime the last time around			1
he stressed that @entity3 's security needs to be the next government 's focus			1
his campaign was also fiercely anti-corruption -- he ran under the slogan of " new broom , " and his supporters were often pictured holding brooms in the lead - up to the vote			0
the elections were largely predicted to be violent and everyone , @entity3 included , expected the worst			1
some families moved abroad and there was sporadic violence across the country in the lead up to the election			0
but those fears turned out to be mostly unfounded , and the elections held relatively peacefully -- with the exception of attacks in the north of the country , where around 11 people died			0
many also praised president @entity19 's gracious and quick concession of defeat as it almost certainly prevented post-election violence			0
president - elect @entity1 said wednesday in a speech to the nation : " the eyes of the world were focused on us to see if we can vote in a peaceful way and carry out elections in an orderly manner			2
" we have proven to the world that we are a people who have embraced democracy and a people who seek a government by , for and for the people			0
" on election day , @entity3 queued for hours in hot weather to cast their vote			2
some of the biometric reader machines malfunctioned -- including the one at president @entity19 's polling station -- and voting had to be extended into the following day			0
but the technical issues did n't keep people from voting -- and in @entity109 , some voters cast their ballots with the aid of the light from their mobile phones			0
and even though some card readers did n't work in some places , many say they helped to cut down on vote rigging			0
@entity45 is n't the only obstacle facing the new president			2
the economy , crime and generating enough power to light up the country are other major issues			0
the pressure will soon be on @entity1 to deliver and there will be no excuses			0
if he fails , @entity3 will be waiting for him at the polls just four short years from now .			0

@entity1 's win marks the first democratic *transition* of power from a ruling party to the opposition
@entity3 , the most populous country in @entity23 , is grappling with violent @entity45 *extremists*
