@entity0 the flight voice recorder aboard @entity3 reportedly captured blaring cockpit alarms , warning co-pilot @entity5 to " pull up " and that " terrain " was ahead			1
but that was not enough to stop the aircraft from slamming into the @entity9			2
with reports that @entity5 apparently ignored those warnings , there are new calls from aviation experts to develop and deploy enhanced crash avoidance software that could take control of an aircraft away from a pilot and steer the plane to a safe altitude			1
the technology would work in a fashion similar to crash avoidance technology already used in automobiles			2
if a pilot is incapacitated or ignores audible warnings , the plane 's flight guidance software could take over and plot a course to a safe altitude ‎			1
in cars , these avoidance systems sometimes deploy brakes or slow a car down to a safer speed , and help maintain safe distances from other vehicles			1
the idea is not new			2
in fact , more than 10 years ago , following 9/11 , @entity39 , the manufacturer of the doomed aircraft , was working to d ‎ evelop aircraft crash avoidance software with tech giant @entity43 -- in part to prevent jetliners from being flown into large buildings or mountains			1
but the project was ultimately scrapped			0
a spokesperson for @entity43 says the company has no plans to revive the project unless federal regulators demand it be put into cockpits or airlines ask for it			0
so far that has not happened			0
@entity1 also asked @entity39 about the project , but the company had no comment			0
former @entity61 inspector general @entity60 says pilots , regulators and the traveling public have , so far , not bought into claims that computers can do it better			0
" for any situation where you are relieving the pilot 's control of their plane , there has been pushback not only from the pilots , but from airlines			1
there are some sectors that believe that ultimately the pilot must maintain overall control of the plane and that that is your best bet for a safe flight			1
" however , she adds , in the case of the @entity3 crash , " this technology , i believe , would have saved the flight			1
not only would it have saved this flight and the @entity3 passengers , it would also save lives in situations where it is not a suicidal , homicidal pilot			1
it has implications literally for safer flight across the industry			2
" pilots ' groups point to numerous instances where a pilot 's training and perhaps unconventional thinking actually saved lives			0
for example , in 2009 capt. @entity107 crash - landed @entity108 into the @entity110 in @entity111 , after a flock of geese was sucked into both of its engines and the @entity118 lost all thrust			0
the formal @entity121 report on the crash said the main thing that contributed to the survivability of the accident was " the decision - making of the flight crewmembers and their crew resource management during the accident sequence			2
" in other words , when @entity107 decided to ditch the plane in the @entity110 , he saved the 150 passengers and five crew members on board			2
pilots say if a computer had taken over after it sensed the plane was headed for water , the outcome could have been very different			2
commercial airline pilot @entity140 says there are other considerations to take into account as well			0
" in systems like this ... the control can not be taken back from the aircraft			2
or , indiscriminately the aircraft could be taken over on just a normal flight and they ( cockpit crew ) would n't be able to get control back			1
i think it is going to take a long time to operationally test this kind of technology before it is foolproof			0
" he also worries that the autopilot software could be vulnerable to hackers			1
" more and more people will come to know the technology			0
they will work on the technology and therefore there will be bad people that will be able to exploit that technology			0
that 's not a good thing			0
" but in an incident like the @entity3 tragedy , where a pilot is being blamed for the crash , @entity60 says there must be additional safeguards and that this technology would be a start			1
" most of the major commercial jetliner crashes in the last two or three years could have been saved with an override			0
" @entity140 says there are already plenty of safeguards in place in the @entity183			0
for example , he says , the @entity184 rule that two people must always be in the cockpit during a flight might also have saved the @entity3 flight			1
that is a practice that several overseas carriers -- including @entity3 and its parent company , @entity193 -- have now adopted			1
" the solution to the problem simply is for the rest of the world globally to adhere to the standards that the @entity183 has used forever , and that is sound hiring practices , safety and training and security practices			0

@entity205 could have taken control of @entity3 flight and flown plane to safe altitude
but some experts say taking control away from humans could lead to other *dangers*
another *concern* : autopilot might be vulnerable to hackers
