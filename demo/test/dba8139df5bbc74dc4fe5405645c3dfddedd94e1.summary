on july 20 , 2012 , excited moviegoers gathered for a midnight screening of " @entity3 " at the @entity5 16 @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6			1
eighteen minutes into the show , and shortly after midnight , a gunman opened fire on the audience			1
twelve people were killed and 70 were injured			1
on monday , shooting suspect @entity12 goes on trial for 165 counts , including murder and attempted murder charges			1
he has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity			1
it 's a moment the survivors and those who lost loved ones have waited for anxiously			1
it 's a moment that will be a painful next step toward healing and one that will no doubt bring back a flood of painful memories			1
ahead of the trial , @entity1 spoke with several people whose lives were changed because of the shooting			1
they will attend at least part of the trial			1
@entity33 made a last - minute decision to go to the movies with a friend			1
@entity33 was shot multiple times and collapsed as he tried to escape			1
the shooter stood above him , and @entity33 prepared to die			2
then , the gunman moved in another direction			2
@entity33 soon saw an officer who told him he was going to make it			2
@entity43 attended the movie with her cousin , @entity46 , his girlfriend , @entity48 , and their daughter , @entity49			2
@entity43 , just 13 at the time , babysat 6 - year - old @entity49 often			2
she had watched her earlier in the day when @entity48 , who was pregnant , had an appointment for an ultrasound			2
when she heard gunfire , @entity43 made a heartrending 911 call			2
@entity48 , @entity46 and @entity49 had all been shot			2
@entity49 was the youngest to die in the theater			1
@entity48 was paralyzed and later suffered a miscarriage because of the trauma she suffered			2
@entity46 was shot in the head and survived			2
@entity60 and @entity61 lost their son , @entity62 , who was in the theater with his girlfriend			1
when the shooting began , @entity62 shielded his girlfriend , saving her life and absorbing the bullets that would take his			1
the @entity68 remember @entity62 as someone who was fearless , funny and gave the greatest hugs			2
" the world had a great person taken out of it that could 've done so much more , " @entity61 said			2
the @entity74 launched a campaign called " @entity80 " to challenge the media to not show photos or use the name of the shooter			2
@entity81 was at the movies with his friend , @entity83			2
as the gunman opened fire , @entity81 and @entity83 dropped to the ground			2
during a break in the gunshots , @entity81 tried to get to the exit , taking @entity83 , who was unconscious , with him			2
the shots started again and it was chaos			2
@entity81 had been hit in the shoulder with buckshot , but he made it to an exit			2
@entity83 did n't make it out alive			1
@entity81 remembers her as a bright and shining person with a contagious smile			2
here , in their own words , is a glimpse at what these people are experiencing 2Â½ years after the shooting and as the trial begins			1
@entity33 : " i do n't think the shooting has defined me as a person			1
but i think what i 've learned from it , the strength that i 've gained from overcoming something this terrible , has become a defining factor of my life			0
" @entity43 : " i would say that the theater shooting is life - changing , but i do n't think it defines me			1
" @entity61 : " the ripple effect from this whole tragedy is just endless			0
it goes on and on and on			0
" @entity119 : " people start to shy away from you , too			0
because it 's just too painful			0
and they 're afraid of the fact that you 're a window into the fact that evil exists			0
because you 're proof that evil exists , not in your persona but in what happened to your child			0
" @entity81 : " and so as you ask about life , how i see it , i just see it in a different lens			0
and it took a while to get used to that lens			0
because i could n't do the same thing i did before			1
i just was n't that person anymore			1
i rarely go out to restaurants and stuff			0
because , you know , people come up to you and start talking about it			0
... " i do n't think anybody who was in that theater that night will ever be the same			1
" @entity33 : " we woke up today , we got out of bed ; this was the day that the @entity151 promised us			0
but he certainly has n't promised us that ... we 'll live to see another one			1
so for me , just living in gratitude and being grateful for every moment i get has been key to my healing			0
" @entity61 : " it does n't get any easier			1
you just learn to fake it better			0
... you get stronger carrying the weight			0
" @entity81 : " ... just like my arm 's going to heal , so will i. and we 'll all move past this			0
and we 'll get stronger			0
" @entity33 : " i do hope to meet him someday			0
it 's something that 's been on my heart since the shooting happened			1
and i hope to meet him and just tell him in person , ' look , you know , you tried to kill me but i do n't hate you , and i forgive you			1
and there 's only one way that 's possible and that 's through @entity174			0
' " @entity43 : " no , i do n't forgive him			1
he took so many people 's lives , and he hurt so many other people that were n't even in the theater			1
he hurt families and friends and just everybody in @entity5 , honestly			1
" @entity61 : " as far as forgiveness goes -- normally , i will forgive someone who asks for forgiveness			0
in this case , i have n't had anyone ask for forgiveness			1
" @entity119 : " @entity190 will forgive anyone who asks for forgiveness			0
but that also means that you have to stand up and take responsibility for your actions			0
" @entity81 : " there 's no doubt about it			0
i really do n't even think about him that much at this point ... i just did n't want to carry that bag of rocks on my back anymore			1
" @entity33 : " the trial starting , i think , will kind of stir things up			1
and it 's been something i 've really been trying to prepare myself for , you know			0
talking to my counselor about it and praying on it daily , and understanding that , again , i ca n't control how it all unfolds , you know			1
but i can be prepared for it			0
" @entity43 : " i 've never been involved in something so serious			0
i do n't think it 's hit me			1
i do n't think i realize what i 'm going into			1
" @entity119 : " it does n't bring these emotions to the surface again for us			1
these emotions never leave for us			0
" @entity81 : " you start thinking about being on that stand			0
you start thinking about seeing the shooter right there			0
you start thinking about -- just all kinds of things and what 's it going to be like			0
and it just races in your head , if you let it , you know ? so part of the coping skills is you just do n't let it			1
go hang out with your wife			0
" @entity33 : " whatever punishment @entity12 receives is not going to be part of my closure			0
i certainly understand that other folks are looking forward to that and that 's their path			0
but we all have different paths to healing			0
" @entity43 : " so , like , i do n't think that if he does get the death penalty , then , i 'll , i do n't know how to word this			1
i wo n't be happy because that 's another person 's life			1
but i think he deserves it			0
" @entity266 : " the only justice , for me ... is if that thing was in an urn on my dresser , and @entity62 was sitting next to us on this couch			0
that 's the only justice			0
" @entity81 : " although i 'm not a death penalty person , if the death penalty was ever warranted in any case , it 's this case			0
