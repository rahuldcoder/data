the night before her daughter 's first triathlon , @entity0 could tell the child was nervous			1
@entity5 and her younger sister , @entity7 , are athletic , loud , curious , wild - haired kids			2
they grew up watching their mother compete in races and @entity5 had asked to sign up for her own			2
still , as they laid out everything she 'd need the next day , @entity12 , a photographer , could tell she was afraid			1
" why do n't we get a picture ? " @entity12 asked @entity5 , now 9			1
" show me your strongest face , show me your bravest face , even if you do n't feel that way right now			2
" as she pulled the image up on her screen , she got chills from her daughter 's direct stare			2
she looked , @entity12 said , like " a little badass			1
" " you 're going to be totally fine , " @entity12 showed her			1
" look at how tough you are			2
" the next day , @entity5 participated in her race , and loved it			0
looking back , " i wanted her to remember that she was scared and she went through with it , sort of as a memento of her conquering a fear , " said @entity12 , who lives near @entity32			1
" as a mom , i really wanted to get a good picture of it , too			0
" the photo is one of @entity12 's favorites from her series , " @entity43 is the @entity44			1
" it covers the last two years , but evolved from @entity12 's early days behind a camera , when she shot daily images of her girls to expand her knowledge of lighting and composition			1
it seemed that most images of little girls showcased perfectly placed hair bows , forced smiles and @entity59 - smooth skin			0
" i did n't want to shoot pictures like that			0
i did n't want girls to think they had to look like that , " said @entity12 , whose daughters are now 6 and 9			1
" whoever they were , however they were , was worthy of an image			0
whatever they were was good enough			0
" so , she shot her girls and their friends as they were -- freckled , muddy , screaming , laughing , jumping in the pool , collecting worms in the creek , barreling into the wilderness of early adolescence on skateboards and bicycles			0
" i want to capture them before they lose that sense of ' i 'm so awesome			0
' i wanted them to keep that as long as they could , " @entity12 said			1
" i started to shoot with that in mind , but it was already there			0
" the girls pose for an occasional portrait , but most are kid - inspired moments , shaped by childish wonderment and energy			0
as parents , @entity12 and her husband encourage their girls to play outside , make new friends and try new things without worrying about grass - stained knees and knots in their hair , @entity12 said			1
now , the girls have the confidence and curiosity to do it on their own			0
" they 're just being themselves , and i 'm just recording it , " @entity12 said			1
responses to the images are mostly positive , @entity12 said , but there 's the occasional complaint that she 's showing just one type of girl			1
it 's true , @entity12 said : they 're the ones she 's raising , the only ones whose adventures she can document 24/7			1
she hopes the project inspires parents to find their own creative ways to capture their children 's lives			0
more important , she wants kids to see they can be strong in whatever they are and whatever they hope to be			2
@entity12 's own kids still surprise her			1
" @entity7 is a beautiful singer			0
when i hear her sing , it makes me cry , " @entity12 said			2
" @entity5 has this amazing , kind heart that cares more about the experience than the win			0
it 's something that i did not teach her			0
" whatever it is , it 's ok			0

@entity0 is the photographer and mother behind " strong is the @entity44 "
