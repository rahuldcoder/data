@entity1 , @entity2 @entity0 is expecting a baby soon			1
she already has a two - year - old son			2
her husband , @entity6 , a cotton farmer , wo n't be around to see his children grown up			2
he committed suicide early in the pregnancy			1
eight years back , @entity0 's father - in - law , also a cotton farmer , took his own life			2
" he was in so much debt , " 25 - year - old @entity0 said of her late husband			1
" he was n't getting any money from cotton			2
he chose death over distress			2
" it 's a familiar story in families across @entity2 's cotton production belt , where , a cotton lobbyist group claims , one cotton farmer commits suicide every eight hours			1
" we get reports of two to three farmer suicides every day , " said @entity24 , leader of the farmers advocacy group , @entity25 ( @entity25 )			1
@entity1 , in the eastern region of the state of @entity31 , is known as the epicenter of the suicide crisis			1
according to @entity25 data , some 2,900 farmers from the area have taken their lives since 2013 ; more than 500 have died since the start of this year			1
there are a number of reasons for the hopelessness among @entity1 farmers			1
unseasonal rain and hail destroyed many crops earlier this year			2
but they 've also had to contend with the flipside : a plentiful harvest in 2014 drove prices down while production costs rose , leaving many farmers either lacking income or burdened with debt from loans taken out to help keep them afloat			1
last year was a record year for cotton production , resulting in a glut of cotton on the world market			2
@entity2 produced 40 million bales of the fiber in 2013/14 crop year , and is the second largest global cotton grower , after @entity64			0
the record surplus of cotton in the global market pushed down prices hurting farmers , particularly in @entity1 , which is becoming increasingly reliant on cotton			1
" our land mostly supports only two crops : cotton and soybean			0
but for the past few years , soybean yield has consistently been decreasing			0
so we mostly depend on cotton , " said @entity77 , a local cotton farmer			0
he said in the past year , cotton prices had halved			1
" i 'm getting around 50 dollars per quintal			0
just a year ago it was 100 dollars			0
i 've never seen such a low price			0
the costs of pesticides , fertilizers and seeds are increasing but the cotton price is falling down			1
" he points out the dismal condition of debt - ridden farmers like himself in @entity1 , many of whom are forced to take out loans or give up farming			1
" government officials do not come to the village and listen to our plight			0
just a few days ago , my neighbor burnt himself alive , " @entity77 said			0
@entity24 , from the farmers advocacy group , said many farmers in @entity1 had lost hope that the situation would improve			1
" it is an epidemic			0
how many more farmers need to commit suicide before the government steps in to find a solution to this problem ? " more than 50 % of @entity2 's population is involved in the agricultural and allied sector , which contributes 18 % of the country 's gdp			1
government data shows 11,772 farmers committed suicide in 2013 across @entity2			1
that is 44 deaths every day			0
earlier this month , prime minister @entity122 raised the amount of compensation paid for damaged crops , and lowered the threshold for farmers to claim payouts			1
however , that failed to appease farmers who are angry about the government 's @entity131 , which critics say makes it easier for the government to seize farmers ' land			1
@entity122 's ruling @entity138 said the old rules were unnecessarily restrictive and the new bill is needed to spur investment and smooth the way for growth			0
the government is expected to reintroduce the new land bill when parliament reopens this week			0
on sunday , thousands of farmers gathered in @entity148 at a rally led by opposition @entity150 to protest against the bill			1
waving flags , they blasted @entity122 government 's policies as " pro-industrialist and anti-farmer			0
" @entity24 , of the farmer 's advocacy group , said the government needs to do more to stop the wave of suicides across the country			0
he said @entity122 's push to open bank accounts for every @entity165 household , neglected to address the major concern in farming households of falling incomes			1
" prime minister @entity122 boasts about @entity2 rising , but he is not willing to talk about @entity2 dying , " @entity24 said			2
he says , for a start , the government should guarantee a better market price for cotton and waive farmers ' overdue debt			1
@entity177 of the @entity1 , @entity176 said the state government is aware of the situation and is planning to roll out relief programs to help local cotton farmers			1
the plans include halving bank loan interest rates and waiving loans from private money lenders			0
@entity176 said the government is also planning to deploy doctors to counsel farmers in distress			2
just days away from her baby 's birth , @entity190 said she worries about how she 's going to feed her family			0
" i have to pay the loan back both to bank and private money lenders			0
i have no clue how i will pay the debt			2
once the baby is born , i will look for work			0
i will have to do labor jobs all my life to pay the loan , " she said , despair in her voice			0
" i did receive compensation from the local state government after my husband 's death			2
but it is very minimal			0
that does nothing to solve the grave problem i am in			0
