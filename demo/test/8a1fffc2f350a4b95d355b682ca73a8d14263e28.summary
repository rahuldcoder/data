@entity0 is a cornerstone event in the @entity3 faith , but it 's surrounded by interesting quirks			1
it celebrates the completion of @entity8 's mission of salvation in the @entity10 and @entity11			2
by dying on @entity12 , @entity8 atoned for the sins of others ; by rising from the grave on sunday , @entity8 conquered death			2
simple enough and reason for @entity18 to celebrate			2
but , like @entity19 with its tree , ornaments and @entity22 , @entity0 has picked up its peripheral trappings -- the bunny and colorful eggs			1
unlike @entity19 , it does n't fall on the same day every year but shifts around in spring depending upon cosmic events			1
and that blood moon we just had -- is it pure coincidence that it fell around @entity0 ? ( no. ) here 's a journey from the @entity32 to the @entity33 , around the moon and the @entity36 's tilting axis , to @entity37 and the @entity38 to try to explain the complex holiday called @entity0			1
and you 'll learn to how to color easter eggs with kool - aid			2
let 's start at the @entity32			2
at the @entity32 , @entity44 began with @entity45 last week and culminated in @entity46 with multiple celebrations in between to mark the final week of @entity8 's mortal life			2
@entity8 rode on the back of a donkey into @entity52 on @entity45 where crowds celebrated him as the @entity55 and laid down palm branches in his path			2
but the crowd and the @entity59 turned on him in the course of the week , according to the @entity61 , leading to his crucifixion and resurrection			2
rain sprinkled down on worshipers standing under a sea of umbrellas as they gathered in a gray @entity68 on sunday to partake in the outdoor services held by @entity71			2
afterward , the @entity72 took a moment to tell the world to do right those in need in his @entity78 address			2
@entity71 lamented the suffering of people in many of the conflicts around the globe			2
from @entity84 to @entity85 , @entity86 to @entity87 , he expressed hope that violence would end			2
@entity71 also does n't put on airs			0
this week he washed the feet of believers , repeating the @entity61 account of a woman , a sinner , washing @entity8 ' feet and anointing them with oil			0
let 's move on to old @entity52 , the birthplace of @entity0			1
the church of the @entity100 in old @entity52 unifies the spot where @entity8 was crucified -- @entity102 -- with his tomb , or sepulcher			0
on sunday , @entity105 and @entity106 @entity18 celebrated the resurrection there			0
in the morning , the @entity109 , the archbishop of @entity52 , entered the basilica			0
then mass was held followed by a procession			0
but a large group of indigenous @entity18 did n't join them			0
it 's not quite @entity0 yet in the @entity33 for @entity116			1
they 'll be celebrating a week from now , because they determine @entity0 's date by a different calendar than @entity18 -- the @entity120			1
which brings us to the question of how astronomy is used to determine the date of @entity46			1
a blood moon appeared in the sky early saturday , right between @entity12 and @entity46 and during @entity128			1
just a coincidence ? not completely , because the dates for both @entity128 -- the @entity132 holiday celebrating the deliverance from slavery in @entity135 -- and @entity0 are determined by moon phases , according to @entity137			1
@entity0 's timing is related to @entity128 , because @entity8 was crucified around then , according to the @entity61			1
many jewish holidays , including @entity128 , fall on full moon , which is also a prerequisite for a lunar eclipse , the event that turns the moon a blood red color			1
since the timing of moon phases does n't jibe with @entity36 's orbit -- which is how we determine the length of a year now -- @entity128 's exact date moves around -- and so does @entity0 's			1
when @entity3 bishops first convened at the @entity153 in the year 325 , they made a rule to determine the date of @entity0 , so as to fairly reliably pin it to @entity128 : it would fall on the first sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox			1
that 's the day in march when @entity36 's axis reaches a midpoint between winter and summer and the day and night are of equal length			0
but ... if the full moon fell on sunday , @entity0 would be pushed down a week			1
confusing ? it got worse			0
when the @entity164 moved from the @entity120 to the gregorian calendar , @entity116 stayed put , resulting in -- usually -- two separate dates for @entity0			1
in 1997 , the @entity167 pushed for a unified method of determining a date based on astronomical occurrences			1
it did n't catch on			0
but some odd @entity0 trappings that popped up after the @entity173 very much have -- the eggs and the bunny			1
the bunny is an egg - laying pagan that worships the moon			1
that 's one notion of its origins , but probably not the actual one			0
@entity37 immigrants appear to have brought it to @entity185 in the 1700s			0
@entity37 historians are not clear on its beginnings , but the first known mention of the bunny and the eggs in writing was in 1682			0
professor of medicine @entity195 described in his paper " @entity198 ovis paschalibus , " or " on easter eggs , " a custom in the @entity202 region involving a bunny and eggs , according to @entity37 public television			0
some also credit the region with inadvertently inventing the christmas tree			0
but @entity195 left out any explanation of how the tradition arose , leading to a number of theories in @entity37			0
one common idea : during @entity214 , people had to abstain from eating eggs , but hens kept on laying them , so farmers boiled and preserved them			0
by the time @entity0 rolled around , they were practically swimming in them			1
they had to figure out something to do with them when the holiday hit			0
play hide and seek with them ; color them ; give them as gifts			0
parents may have invented the bunny as a playful explanation for children on where the @entity0 eggs came from			1
if you 're coloring eggs this year , here 's an interesting tip. instead of stinking up your place with the smell of vinegar , use @entity241 , @entity243 science geek @entity242 suggests			1
and it appears to work			0
just use a whole packet in a small glass of hot water and gently lay the eggs in			0
they turn out as bright as they would in any other food dye			0
but be careful , it stains everything else , like clothes and upholstery , @entity242 warns			0
that 's why your tongue changes colors when you drink it			0
happy @entity0 ! happy @entity128 !			1

@entity0 is a key event in the @entity3 faith , but where did the @entity265 come from ?
why is the date different every year , and what does it have to do with the moon ?
