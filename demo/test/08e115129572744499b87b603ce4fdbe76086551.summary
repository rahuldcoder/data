police arrested the suspect at 11 p.m. tuesday			1
" after developing information that @entity13 was the third suspect seen in the video of the gang rape , @entity11 obtained a warrant for his arrest , " according to a news release			1
investigators discovered that @entity13 had family in @entity21 , @entity22 , and reached out to the sheriff 's office there			1
deputies in @entity21 , in the @entity26 area , tracked down @entity13 and arrested him on a charge of sexual assault by multiple perpetrators , the @entity24 said			1

@entity39 , a member of the track and field team , has also been removed from the team			2
" @entity39 is represented by a public defender			2
@entity38 's legal representation is unclear			2
no public statement has been made on either 's behalf			2
the arrests come after a woman told police she may have been drugged and gang - raped on a beach behind a popular club in broad daylight as bystanders watched			1
the woman did n't recall the assault , police say , but she saw the video of her alleged assault on the news , and though the footage had to be blurred , she recognized her tattoos and contacted authorities			1
it 's not the first time this has happened to a young woman in @entity2 , authorities say			1
four young men were involved in the assault , @entity8 sheriff @entity79 said , and while he previously said federal marshals were trying to track down a third suspect and investigators were seeking a possible witness , it 's unclear if the person arrested tuesday was someone the police had been looking for			1
" there 's hundreds , hundreds of people standing there -- watching , looking , seeing , hearing what 's going on , " @entity79 said			2
" and yet our culture and our society and our young people have got to the point where obviously this is acceptable somewhere			1
i will tell you it is not acceptable in @entity8			2
" authorities have said they plan to interview the woman and show her the full video to see whether she knows the attackers and can help identify other suspects , said @entity106 , spokeswoman for the sheriff 's office			1
authorities are pressing charges , and the woman plans to cooperate , @entity106 said			1
investigators were to meet with her this week			2
after interviewing witnesses , @entity8 investigators determined the alleged rape took place between march 10 and march 12 , behind @entity117 , a popular bar and dance club for spring breakers			0
she " does not remember the assault at all , " @entity106 said			0
" she remembers taking a drink from a @entity122 and there is a strong possibility she was drugged			0
" ( @entity122 sells various products for transporting water or other drinks			0
) she was visiting @entity2 at the time of the assault , and is now home , authorities said			1
the @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity132 found the video during the course of an investigation into an unrelated shooting and turned it over to the @entity137			0
the video shows suspects pushing the victim 's hand aside and holding her legs down , @entity106 said			0
" you can see in the video there are people two feet away			0
they were assaulting her , and we believe the people around her knew she was being assaulted			0
" the suspects can be heard commenting about what they are doing to her , @entity106 said			0
authorities have three sworn statements from witnesses stating that the assault happened , @entity106 said			1
the sheriff 's office released part of the video to local tv stations , which blurred portions of it before airing			0
@entity4 is showing part of what was released			0
while the video is " one of the most disgusting , repulsive , sickening things that i 've seen this year on @entity2 , " it 's not an isolated incident , @entity79 said			0
" this is not the first video we 've recovered			0
it 's not the second video			0
it 's not the third video			0
there 's a number of videos we 've recovered with things similar to this , and i can only imagine how many things we have n't recovered			1
" @entity106 said that through social media , " we have been able to find video of girls , incoherent and passed out , and almost like they are drugged , being assaulted on the beaches of @entity2 in front of a bunch of people standing around			0
" about 100,000 spring break revelers come to the beach community every year			1
this year , the @entity24 made more than 1,000 arrests for various crimes -- about triple the number of arrests made in the same period last year			0
@entity4 's @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200 contributed to this report .			0
