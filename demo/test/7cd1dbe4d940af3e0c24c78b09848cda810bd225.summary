we 're 2 degrees from a different world			1
humans never have lived on a planet that 's 2 degrees @entity6 ) warmer than it was before we started burning fossil fuels , in the late 1800s , and climate experts say we risk fundamentally changing life on this planet if we do cross that 2 - degree mark			1
" this is gambling with the planet , " said @entity13 , the lead senior economist at the @entity14 and co-author of the book " @entity17			1
" think super droughts , rising seas and mass extinctions			2
yet for all of its importance , i do n't think the 2 - degree threshold is as famous as it should be			1
i 've heard it referred to as the " north star " for climate negotiations			2
meaning : this one little number carries huge importance as a way to focus the world 's attention			1
it 's so significant that it 's going to be the subject of my reporting for the rest of the year			1
i 'm calling that effort " 2 degrees , " and i need your help to make it work			1
until 5 p.m. et monday , you can vote on the first story i 'll report for the series			2
vote using the @entity47 poll below ( or go here if you do n't see it			2
) tell @entity1 's @entity49 which of these climate change stories you like best - and he 'll report on the winner			1
this poll closes monday , april 27 , at 5pm et. # 2degrees all of those story ideas came from you , by the way			0
they focus on what a 2 - degree world might look like			1
@entity1 kicked off this effort with a @entity47 chat last week			0
we asked for your questions about climate change and about the 2 - degree threshold , specifically			1
i do n't have all the answers right now			0
we 'll continue to explore the importance of this number together			1
but below you 'll find quick responses to seven basic questions about this crucial number			1
many of them come straight from you , the readers			0
and i tossed in a couple of my own			0
if you 'd like to follow this project as it evolves , i 'd encourage you to sign up for the " 2 degrees " newsletter			1
and feel free to ask more questions in the comments section below			0
they 'll shape the way i spend the rest of the year reporting on this super-critical number			1
one guy , it turns out			0
@entity90 , an economist at @entity91			0
@entity90 , 73 , proposed the 2 - degree threshold in a 1977 ( 1977 ! ) paper titled " economic growth and climate : the @entity95			1
" the estimate was " crude , but it was a reasonable first start , " he told me			0
" if there were global temperatures more than 2 or 3 degrees above the current average temperature , this would take the climate outside of the range of observations which have been made over the last several hundred thousand years , " he wrote in " @entity99			1
" a growing body of research now supports the idea			0
science has continued to raise red flags about 2 degrees of warming			1
and that work has led policy experts to conclude that a 2 - degree world is something none of us should want			1
" you need a judgment call for these things , " said @entity118 , chair of the @entity119 , who has written on the history of 2 degrees @entity6			1
" and this 2 - degree thing was a judgment call that happened at the interface of science and policy			1
" @entity130 was first to push 2 degrees as an policy goal , @entity118 told me			1
that happened in the 1990s			0
later came the @entity134 , the @entity135 , the @entity136 and , most significantly , the @entity137 , which was signed by more than 100 nations who agreed 2 degrees would be too much			1
the @entity140 was among the signatories			0
i 'm going to spend the month of may exploring this question , so look for more on this			0
but here are some striking facts about what scientists expect a post- 2 - degree world to look like			1
these are pulled from reports by the @entity151 , the @entity152 and the @entity153			0
wildfires in the @entity140 are expected to increase 400 % to 800 % in size			0
hurricanes are expected to become 2 % to 8 % more intense			1
a range of species will be at risk for extinction , particularly amphibians			0
the @entity152 estimates 20 % to 30 % of animals and plants species will be at " increasingly high risk of extinction " at or near the 2 - degree mark			1
the @entity166 is expected keep melting , losing 30 % of its annual average sea ice			0
certain crop yields in the @entity140 , @entity171 and @entity172 are expected to decrease 10 % to 30 %			0
the availability of freshwater is expected to decline by 20 %			0
and numbers do n't convey the emotional toll			0
" i 'm from @entity179 , " said @entity90 , the economist who proposed the 2 - degree threshold			1
" i love it there , and i know it 's going to be a completely different climate			2
the trout fishing probably wo n't be as good			0
the hiking wo n't be as good			0
these forests may look completely different , or burn down			0
it 's one of my things i love most			2
and that 's obviously affected by warming			1
i love the ocean , and the @entity193 coastline , and it 's in peril			2
that 's just for starters			2
" no one knows , exactly			0
think of 2 degrees like a sort of speed limit -- or a zone of increased risk			1
@entity202 , a climate scientist at @entity204 , told me that burning fossil fuels is like smoking			0
how many cigarettes give you cancer ? no one knows , exactly			0
but the more you smoke , the more you up your risk			0
and 2 degrees , policy experts agree , is certainly risky territory			1
plus , everyone hates a fraction			0
targeting 1 degree of warming is " ridiculous because you ca n't do it , " said @entity90 , the economist			2
" three sounds too high			0
and you ca n't have a fraction because it 's too complicated			2
" so two is kind of an obvious number			2
" the climate already has warmed 0.85 degrees since the @entity228			2
and we reasonably can expect to reach 1.5 degrees simply based on the pollution we 're already putting into the atmosphere , even with " very ambitious mitigation action " to reduce carbon emissions , according to a 2014 report from the @entity153			2
some of that warming is " locked - in to the @entity238 's atmospheric system , " that organization says			1
the impacts of climate change already are being felt			0
yes , but it wo n't be easy			0
" if you want to stay below 2 degrees , you have to reduce emissions at an amazing speed -- to an incredible degree , " said @entity118 from the @entity119			1
here 's the best guess for what that " amazing speed " might need to look like : cutting greenhouse gas emissions by some 80 % to 90 % by 2050 , said @entity250 , global director of the climate program at the @entity253			2
" it depends on how much risk you want to accept , " she said			0
some activists , including those from 350.org and @entity259 , which together organized the largest climate change rally in history last year in @entity263 , want to accept less risk than that			0
" our position is 100 % clean energy , " said @entity266 , a senior campaigner for @entity259			0
if we continue burning fossil fuels at the current rate , we could hit 2 degrees of warming before midcentury			1
scarier still , we could hit 3 to 5 degrees of warming by 2100			1
some writers have called for the world to abandon the 2 - degree target , saying it 's too ambitious , or even naive			1
but we need a yardstick to measure progress -- and we need that " north star " to help us set goals that actually would be weighty enough to make a dent in this problem			2
if you think 2 degrees sounds bad , 5 degrees is far , far worse			1
the @entity152 expects a 5 - degree world to be characterized by " major extinctions around the globe " and a " reconfiguration of coastlines worldwide			2
" just beyond that , at 6 degrees , we 're looking a " catastro - f * * * " that would be almost " infinitely costly , " said @entity13 , the @entity14 economist			2
" it 's akin to killing the planet , basically			1
or society on the planet			2
" this much should be clear : something has to change			0
if we shoot for 2 degrees and end up at 3 , that 's still better ( or less awful ) than 5 or 6			1
what 's important is that we maintain a sense of urgency , and keep sight of the goal			2
