@entity1 , @entity2 in the canvas expanse of the @entity6 refugee camp , thousands of @entity0 live within hearing distance of one of @entity2 @entity2 's frontlines with @entity10			1
the vast majority of the camp 's occupants are from the town of @entity15 and fled the @entity10 assault there back in august			1
@entity10 took thousands of @entity0 captive			1
men faced a choice -- convert to @entity20 or be shot			2
but the @entity22 militants separated the young women and girls to be sold as sex slaves			1
in its fourth edition of " @entity28 , " the @entity10 online magazine , an article titled " the revival of slavery before the hour , " outlines the group 's twisted justification and guidelines for the enslavement of the @entity0			1
" one should remember that enslaving the families of the kuffar ( infidels ) and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of @entity43 , " the article reads			2
we 're told that women who have just given birth or are breastfeeding are considered impure and can not be taken as sexual slaves -- but @entity48 , 19 , was neither of those things			1
" they separated all of us , " she says			2
" they dragged us away by our hair			2
they took married women , young ones			2
the youngest with us was just 10			0
" they said we are going to marry you off , you will forget your family			0
" @entity10 : enslaving , having sex with ' unbelieving ' women , girls is ok for the first week , @entity48 was held with 50 others , regularly beaten and threatened with torture , and fed just a bowl of rice			1
the group was then taken to a three story building in @entity69 she described as a sex slave warehouse , where hundreds of girls and women were held			1
" they would line about 50 of us up at a time , in rows of 10			0
they would say do n't move , do n't cry or we will beat you			0
the men would come in and describe the kind of girl they wanted and then they would pick and choose as they pleased , " she recalls			0
she was eventually chosen , part of a group of 25			0
from that group @entity48 was separated into a smaller group of seven and taken into a house in a village			1
' treated like cattle ' : @entity0 women sold , raped , enslaved by @entity10 two @entity10 fighters guarded the door and ordered the girls to clean and bathe themselves			1
" they brought in a @entity0 girl who had been with them for two months			0
she was wearing the black niqab			0
they said to us we are going to do to you what we did to her , " @entity48 says			1
" the girl spoke to us in @entity104 and said they beat me , they cuffed me and raped me			0
" @entity48 and the others decided they had to try to escape			1
that night they crawled out the bedroom window			0
" the fourth girl jumped out , i was the fifth			0
i crawled to the wall and was about to jump over it and then i saw their flashlight , " she tells me			0
" they caught the last two girls			2
" they ran , and somehow evaded capture			0
four hours later they were out of @entity10 territory			1
" if i just see someone with a beard i start shaking , " @entity48 says			2
now physically free but mentally still captive , @entity48 remains tormented -- like so many others , by what she has been through and what those still with @entity10 are being forced to endure -- a fate worse than death			1
fleeing isis -- a @entity0 family 's tale			0

@entity48 , 19 , was captured by @entity10 when militants took the town of @entity15
