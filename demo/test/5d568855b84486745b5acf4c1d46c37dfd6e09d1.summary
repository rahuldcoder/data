i remember traveling one day in the local train in @entity3 with my mother , my younger sister and brother			0
the compartment was extremely crowded			1
as we prepared to disembark , i felt my skirt being lifted and someone groping my private parts			0
i wanted to scream , but my voice would have drowned in the noise of the crowd			0
i wanted to push the hands away , but my arms were pinned to my body			0
i wanted to cry but could only think to myself , " stop it ! please stop touching me			0
" i was 13 years old			0
i never told anyone about that day until recently			0
twenty - five years later , i continue to hear similar stories of women and girls being harassed on local transportation and other public spaces			1
the stories can be stomach churning : men masturbating on buses and at bus stops , boys stalking young girls -- both physically and online , men taking pictures of women without permission and uploading them on the @entity38			1
then there are just the everyday , uncomfortable stares , frequently accompanied by comments with sexual connotations			0
this is n't all simply anecdotal			0
a study by @entity45 found that 80 % of women in @entity3 had been street harassed , primarily in crowded areas like trains and railway platforms			1
most people , including women , only think of sexual violence as rape and tend to overlook touching , groping and stalking , not to mention the " milder " forms of ogling , leering , catcalling and whistling , even though all of this can be intimidating			1
indeed , many women choose to limit their hours outside , select more conservative clothes , or opt for a longer but safer route home			1
it was only recently that i realized my phobia of trains likely originated with that bad experience i had as a child			2
i still avoid trains when i can			2
most people are silent when inappropriate sexual behavior occurs to women			2
it was depressing to hear one young college student tell me in a recent sexual harassment workshop i led that " staring and commenting by men is normal and i 've learned to ignore it			2
" the reality is that sexual harassment in @entity78 is pervasive in all aspects of life			1
it hits you in the face every day when you walk down the street , take local transport , go about your daily routine or at the workplace			1
according to @entity91 women 's report , 1 in 3 women around the world face some form of sexual violence at least once in their lifetime			1
this statistic is likely even higher in @entity78			1
out of the 2,000 women who have attended workshops i 've conducted , only a handful of them have never been at the receiving end of harassment in some setting of their daily lives			1
shockingly , less than 10 of them had reported harassment to any official channel			2
why are we constantly limiting our options rather than confronting sexual harassment ? over the past two years , i have been working to encourage women to talk about their experiences and realize the tremendous potential power they hold within themselves through acknowledging the problem and being a part of the change to shift the culture around sexual harassment in @entity78			1
it is not always easy speaking up about sexual harassment			2
but acknowledging that it is unacceptable is an important first step			0
@entity78 has laws for sexual violence in public spaces as well as at the workplace , and knowing these rules gives women the power to confront her harasser			1
but is it enough ? women still have to confront the cultural challenge of not feeling " ashamed " and bringing " disrepute " to their families while overcoming their fear of dealing with the police , who too often file complaints in the wrong categories to reduce the number of official cases on which their performance is judged			2
however , despite the barriers , two recent cases in @entity78 provide proof that even when the perpetrator is in a position of immense power , coming forward to report sexual harassment can make a difference			1
there is , for example , the young employee from an environmental research organization who alleged that her boss @entity157 made unwelcome advances to her through text messages			0
her bold and persistent quest for justice resulted in @entity157 stepping down from his position as chair of the @entity91 @entity165			0
@entity157 denied the allegations and insisted his computer and phone were hacked			0
his counsel stated in court that @entity157 's inbox was not hacked , but he had shared the password with several people who could have sent inappropriate emails to the employee under his name			2
similarly , last year , @entity177 , founder of one of @entity78 's leading media companies , was arrested for sexually assaulting his employee in an elevator			1
she first told her female editor who reportedly did not take her seriously			0
she then spoke about it to her male colleagues who encouraged her to report the incident to the police			0
@entity177 , who explained the incident as a " bad lapse of judgment , " was let out on interim bail while the case is still ongoing			0
women have allies -- both male and female -- who are willing to help clear the barriers			2
women everywhere just need to find the courage to speak up			1
the alternative to speaking out is a world where women feel less able to live full lives , restricted and disempowered			0
we can not accept harassment as part of our daily routine			1
we can not ignore it -- for our own sake and the next generation of women .			0

women in @entity78 are street harassed , primarily in crowded areas like trains and railway platforms
@entity221 : it 's time we speak up ; we can not accept harassment as part of our daily routine
