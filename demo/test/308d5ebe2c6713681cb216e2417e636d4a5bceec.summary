we did it again , in another @entity3 city			2
we set @entity4 on fire this time			1
we turned a funeral into a riot			2
we let things get out of hand			2
we threw stones at policemen			2
we threw stones at citizens			2
we created camera - ready chaos , and we replayed the images			2
we created a culture of such deep distrust and disrespect that violence seemed the inevitable response			2
we let the violence flow			2
we let the violence stand for everything that 's wrong with the things we already did n't like			1
by now you may be asking , " who 's we ? " you may be saying with some irritation , " do n't lump me in with them			1
i did n't have anything to do with it			2
" to which the only real answer can be : stop kidding yourself			2
the word " we " is one of the great @entity3 words			0
i use " we " a lot when i talk about our country 's achievements			1
i like to say we won the @entity45 , we put a man on the moon , we invented the @entity48 , we gave the world jazz			0
well , if @entity52 -- a son of immigrants whose family had nothing to do with any of those accomplishments -- if i get to claim those aspects of @entity3 history , then surely i have to claim the unsavory aspects too			0
" we " cuts both ways			0
we cut reconstruction short and made a mockery of equal citizenship			1
we supported @entity63 , then redlined , subordinated , and ghettoized african - americans			0
we cut blacks out of the @entity66			0
we created a polity in which racial inequity and economic inequality magnify each other unrelentingly			0
we tried to put a lid on it with heavy policing and a @entity74			0
we are the authors of every page of @entity4 's story			1
do n't tell me it 's not your responsibility or mine			1
about how slavery and its legacy are artifacts of a time past			1
no , we own them all			0
and we all have to face that before we can fix anything in @entity4 or beyond			1
but there 's another dimension of the story of " we " that matters as well			1
it 's about progressives and conservatives and their competing stories of how we got here			1
every time protests and violence break out in response to police brutality , the same depressing pattern breaks out			1
the event becomes simply a rorschach test for left and right , and each side sees in the rioting confirmation of its prior views			1
for the left , it 's about the deep structural root causes of the alienation and violence			1
liberals gravitate on social media to commentaries or reactions that reinforce this frame , like the surprisingly astute comments from the @entity122 executive who spelled out why a long history of racial injustice and economic disenfranchisement made rioting nearly inevitable			1
conservatives gravitate to their own frames , about a lack of personal responsibility or role models among poor urban blacks , about the failures of @entity135 and @entity137 programs , and about how it all comes back to a president ( who happens to be black ) who has divided us by focusing so much on race			1
what gets lost in this @entity144 replay of left - right frames is a simple reality that we all have to recognize : both longstanding structural racism and personal irresponsibility are on display this week			0
both a history of police brutality and a present crisis of street violence			0
both an inherited , multigenerational lack of opportunity and a dearth of leaders willing to address it			0
we can not separate out the aspects of the problem that do n't fit our preferred explanation -- not if we are sincere about solving the problem			0
and until more people can see this , we will not see progress			0
we ca n't judge looters for their antisocial behavior without judging a color - caste structure and a school - to - prison pipeline that has flushed them away like so much refuse			0
by the same token , we ca n't keep opining about root causes without also supporting the parents and pastors and neighbors who , in their own small ways , are organizing each other to break the cycle of brokenness			0
i 'm of the left			0
but it can not possibly be that only those with whom i disagree are responsible for what is happening in @entity4			1
it can not possibly be that only my worldview contains all the solutions			0
whatever our political perspective , we need to open our eyes to what is actually happening in @entity4 and other cities in the @entity3 in the second decade of the 21st century			1
we should all be able to say that			0
it 's time to push each other out of our ideological and identity comfort zones and build unlikely coalitions to create more opportunity			1
it 's time to act like we are all in charge			1
and there is no other " we " waiting in the wings .			0

in @entity4 , after the death of @entity212 , riots erupted , cars were set on fire and 200 arrests were made
@entity216 : liberals and conservatives react *predictably* , see the riots as confirmation of their views
it 's time to push each other out of our ideological and identity comfort zones and change the status *quo* , he says
