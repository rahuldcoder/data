most airline pilots have an above average ability to compartmentalize personal problems			2
the cockpit is our " safe " place			2
the flight deck is a structured world of black and white			2
stress from the job is an accepted part of our career			2
however , sometimes during the course of an airline pilot 's career , or anyone 's career for that matter , stress issues may manifest as depression			1
and for airline pilots , it is no longer debilitating to our livelihood			2
the @entity29 now approves certain prescribed medication , allowing us to continue flying until depression is no longer a factor			2
as the world learns more about @entity34 , the co-pilot on @entity35 , it is readily apparent that this young man had psychiatric issues far beyond clinical depression			1
he reportedly was administered a series of injections to mitigate his problems , an absolute reflection on the serious nature of his illness			2
but @entity34 's illness did n't just appear out of thin air			1
its effects had to be apparent to others			2
@entity34 's girlfriend made her concerns public knowledge -- unfortunately after events took their course			1
considering the hoops @entity34 had to jump through to have established himself as a @entity57 co-pilot , it 's curious to me how the red flags of his illness were missed			1
to what hoops am i referring ? first , let 's start with his passion for gliders			1
glider flying is one of the purest forms of aviation			2
although it is mostly an individualistic endeavor , the sport involves teamwork			2
interaction among fellow enthusiasts is paramount to both enjoyment and safety			0
i 'm a glider pilot			0
participation among the members of my club uncovers the personalities and idiosyncrasies of each pilot			0
behaviors not quite conducive to the activity are readily apparent			0
second , @entity34 had to compete successfully in a selection process just to have the opportunity to train through @entity88 's flight program , a requirement of @entity57 employment			1
the selection process is most likely highly competitive , requiring above - average aptitude			0
is the selection process flawed to the extent that a serious mental disorder would go unnoticed ? regardless , the process had to be a stressful experience			0
opinion : @entity57 and the stigma of mental illness once accepted into the flight program , a rigorous training period began			1
for primary training , @entity88 utilizes an ab initio ( from the beginning ) program based at a facility the airline owns in @entity109 , @entity110 , near @entity111			1
the training is geared toward a multi-crew pilot license , or @entity114 , recognized by the @entity115			1
the purpose of an mpl is to funnel airline pilot candidates having little or no flight time into the right seat as first officers			0
countries that do n't have the luxury of selecting from a large pool of experienced pilots use this license			0
airline pilots in the @entity127 are not licensed in this manner , requiring as much as 1,500 hours to qualify as a co-pilot			1
this is a fairly recent change in @entity29 regulations , initiated as a result of the 2009 @entity134 crash in @entity135 , @entity136			0
@entity34 had barely over 600 hours of flight time when he committed his act of horror			1
as a 21 - year - old flight instructor , i had that much flight time ; it hardly qualified as a lot of experience			0
as with all of the @entity114 programs , the training involves an intense period of airline - specific instruction			1
and to add insult to injury , candidates are not paid during the training until such time as they pass a final check ride			1
regardless , the cost is borne by the student to the tune of about $ 76,000			0
using both actual flight experience in a single - engine airplane and simulator time , the student receives about 250 hours of training			1
it is a period of almost constant supervision			0
aside from observing and checking performance criteria , would n't at least one instructor have noticed behavioral issues in such an intense environment ? and would n't a fellow trainee have noticed also ? according to reports , @entity34 took a leave from his training -- a very untypical behavior			1
was that not in and of itself a red flag ? would n't a manager in @entity88 's flight department consider it prudent to reconsider a candidate with an indication of potential issues ? after all , the selection process was most likely highly competitive , with other qualified candidates readily available			1
once the primary training in @entity110 was complete , @entity34 would have returned to @entity187 and completed more specific schooling on the @entity189 he was about to fly			1
again , no one observed issues			0
but even more curious , according to reports , @entity34 disclosed a diagnosis of previous depression to @entity88			1
over the course of a career , an airline pilot spends thousands of hours sharing the confined space of the cockpit with colleagues			0
even if we have never flown with a particular individual , experience allows us the intuition to know when something is n't quite right			0
that determination can be made through performance observation of typical routines , or perhaps through a simple conversation			0
in that regard , i find it difficult to believe that none of @entity34 's colleagues made a less than positive assessment at some point in time			1
as supplemental background , @entity57 had been established as the low - cost , alter ego carrier of @entity88			0
depending upon a pilot 's monthly flight time , salary for pilots can be as much as 20 % lower than the mainline carrier			1
in addition , more days on duty were part of a @entity57 crew member 's schedule			2
apparently as late as march 20 , @entity88 pilots had been on strike , one of the main disputes being an early retirement option and less desirable working conditions for new hires			0
perhaps enough of a disparity existed for @entity57 pilots such that medical leave benefits would not have covered @entity34 's absence			1
regardless , all of these factors combined to add a perfect storm of stress to one sick 27 - year - old man			0
the world knows the end result			0
it just seems to me that this was an accident waiting to happen			0
could it have been prevented ? well , this is the primary purpose of accident investigation : never allow the same tragedy to occur again .			0

@entity258 : there were likely *warning* signs during the co-pilot 's training
he says @entity34 had to go through many challenges to qualify to be a co-pilot
