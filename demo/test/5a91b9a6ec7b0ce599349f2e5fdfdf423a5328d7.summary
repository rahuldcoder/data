pushed to his limits , a college professor took the extreme measure of threatening to fail his entire class			1
in an email to his students , @entity5 accused them of " backstabbing , game playing , cheating , lying , fighting			1
" the professor at the @entity13 expected his missive would create some conflict , but that it could then be resolved quickly -- and quietly			2
those hopes were dashed when one report by local media mushroomed into a tornado of nationwide coverage			2
suddenly , his name was spreading on @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 , accompanied by the kind of strong , unvarnished opinions that you can make about people you 've never met			2
he was a hero who taught today 's entitled youth a much - needed lesson , or an egotistical nightmare of a teacher who threw a fit			2
one thing was certain : he , and his employer , were now thrust into a spotlight that neither had asked for			0
" i did what i did without any intention of seeing this in the news or seeing this on the @entity45 , " @entity5 said			1
" i will stand by what i did , but i 'm not career suicidal			2
" @entity13 says @entity5 remains an employee and that no one has asked him to stop teaching			1
but @entity5 , a nontenure - track professor in the maritime administration program , is afraid the notoriety will cost him this job and future jobs			1
@entity5 said his intent was not to be controversial , and the sharply worded email to students was not his first about the class			1
the day before writing to his students , @entity5 wrote a similar email to the ceo of the @entity63 and to the school 's chief academic officer			1
" i have never in my capacity as an academic ever encountered a class as completely disgraceful , dishonest and disrespectful " as his current strategic management class , he wrote to the administrators			2
he accused the students of shirking responsibility , making excuses and complaining their way to better grades			0
he would no longer teach the course and would fail the entire class , @entity5 wrote			1
" the class of graduating seniors is nothing more than a circus that is anything but academic , " he wrote			2
" but they are your problem now			0
" it was the next day that @entity5 wrote to the students , calling the class " an embarrassment in general , " and said that " i am frankly and completely disgusted			1
" once his words echoed in traditional and social media , the narrative -- angry prof flunks entire class -- might as well have been set in stone			1
the story was such a talker that even @entity97 offered a parody			0
" i 'm not looking to fail students , " @entity5 said			1
" i do n't get a bonus for failing students			0
" " the letter sounded a little bit more definite than i wanted it to , " he added			0
he never actually changed anyone 's grade			0
there were some students he was n't going to fail , he said , and some who were on the border who could have pulled themselves out			2
but @entity5 stands by his tough stance ; there was an issue of competency and of professionalism that had to be addressed , he said			1
the course in question is a capstone course for a maritime administration degree and is supposed to merge what the students learned in their other business courses			0
" i had a large majority of people taking the capstone course who could not do a break - even analysis , " the professor said			0
" if you can not do a break - even analysis , then you do n't deserve a bachelor 's degree in business			0
" his other complaint was about professionalism			0
@entity5 said students would swear at him , cheat and spread rumors about him online			1
this is related to their grades , he said , because dealing with people you do n't like is a business skill			0
on online message boards , users claiming to be students in the class accused the professor of exaggerating the situation or fabricating parts of his story			2
one purported student called @entity5 " a little obnoxious , " but said he is a good teacher and fair if you follow his rules			1
should the professor have been surprised that his email went viral ? the fiery language and strong allegations were likely to be news if the email went public , but maybe there is more to it			1
the situation hits on a popular argument on the media and @entity45 : what do we think of millennials ? reflecting on his most recent class , @entity5 said there is some truth to stereotypes of millennials as entitled and pampered			1
he mentioned the overdependence of students on cell phones and other electronics , and the power those devices have to interrupt concentration			0
the other factor is a failure of k - 12 education , said @entity5 , who has met college students who do n't know how to convert fractions to decimals			1
" what i 'm trying to do is to give an honest assessment of their performance , " he said			0
in a statement , @entity190 , the vice president for academic affairs and chief academic officer at @entity63 , said the entire class will not be failed			1
" each student will receive an individual grade based upon work completed during the semester , " @entity190 said			0
" the university is listening to concerns about this issue from students and faculty and will address them according to our policies			0
" the flurry of attention is unwelcome and @entity5 fears it will affect his career in academia			1
but it 's likely his story will have a short shelf life			0
people probably will forget about it and turn their attention to the next grabby headline			2
but he said he thinks this episode will follow him everywhere			0
he said he feels a public shaming of sorts			0
online public shaming has become a research topic of its own			0
people who have been pilloried online for comments they made wonder if they will get a second chance			0
" this is really destroying my life , " @entity5 said .			1

@entity5 threatens to fail his entire class
his fiery email goes viral ; he now wonders if the unwanted attention will affect his career
