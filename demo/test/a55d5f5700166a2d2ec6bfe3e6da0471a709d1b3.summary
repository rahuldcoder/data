the @entity0 can rest more comfortably living in @entity2 now that their 5 - year - old daughter can get the marijuana extract she needs			1
" this means the world to us , " said @entity6 's mother , @entity5			2
gov. @entity10 signed a bill thursday that will legalize low - @entity13 cannabis oil for certain " medication - resistant epilepsies , " while creating an infrastructure , registration process and research program for the drug			1
( @entity13 is the primary psychoactive substance in marijuana			0
) the bill is dubbed @entity6 's @entity22			1
@entity6 , who has been the face of the bill , was having hundreds of seizures a day and the five potent drugs meant to control them were n't making life better for the little girl			1
@entity5 said in a march 2014 interview that she made the difficult decision to move her daughter to @entity33 , where medical marijuana is legal , in hopes of saving her life			1
" she was maxed out , " @entity5 said			0
" she 'd quit breathing several times a day , and the doctors blamed it on the seizure medications			0
" 10 diseases marijuana could affect @entity5 had heard that a form of medical marijuana might help , but it was n't available in @entity2			1
so a week after hearing a doctor 's diagnosis that @entity6 might not live another three months , she and @entity6 packed up and moved to @entity48 , @entity33			2
there , @entity6 began a regimen of cannabis oil : four times a day and once at night			2
" every time she smiled i knew we did the right thing , because we had n't seen her smile in three years , " @entity5 said			0
" now she 's thriving , she 's healthy , she 's happy , and they 're absolutely shocked at the difference			0
so i think we 've turned some nonbelievers into believers of cannabis oil			0
" deal is apparently one of those believers , signing @entity65 on thursday and opening the door for the use of cannabis oil to treat certain medical conditions			0
the bill will benefit not only people who suffer from chronic seizure disorders , but it also will allow patients to receive in - state treatment			2
to obtain a license in @entity2 , you will need to have a specific covered condition , such as acute seizures			1
" for the families enduring separation and patients suffering pain , the wait is finally over , " @entity10 said thursday			2
" ... now , @entity2 children and their families may return home while continuing to receive much - needed care			2
" for @entity5 , it 's a blessing " to be able to come back home , and with @entity6 's medicine , it 's done wonders for her -- going from 200 - plus seizures a day and on her deathbed to a smiling , happy girl who says words now and looks us in the eye and lets us know she 's in there			1
" she added , " @entity33 has been good to us , but @entity2 's home			0
" with medical marijuana legal in nearly half the states , doctors are increasingly studying what effect the drug has on various ailments			1
while @entity2 's law is specific to a handful of conditions , medical marijuana laws in states such as @entity112 permit marijuana use for an array of ailments			1
but as states rewrite their regulations , federal law remains the same : marijuana is illegal to grow , sell or use for any purpose			0
under the @entity120 , marijuana is listed on @entity120 , meaning it has " no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse			0
" to backers of reform , it presents a @entity128 : marijuana is restricted , in large part , because there is scant research to support medical uses , yet research is difficult to conduct because of tight restrictions .			0
