@entity0 , @entity1 the ride from @entity4 to near the epicenter of @entity1 's devastating earthquake is not for those who get easily carsick			1
steep slopes and small winding roads through deep river valleys greet us as we make our way to a town where @entity1 and international medical teams are treating the injured , in much less than ideal circumstances			1
the view along the six - hour journey from the capital is deceptive			1
although i see numerous landslides , i am surprised that the villages we are driving through are relatively unaffected			1
during the entire journey , i notice only about 10 collapsed or seriously damaged houses			1
one of the biggest challenges rescue workers are facing in @entity1 is reaching affected people in remote mountainous areas			1
one of them is @entity29 , a district northwest of @entity4			1
the town we were visiting looks intact			1
some houses have cracks , and i see a few collapsed brick walls			1
most of the shops and businesses are open			1
but our first stop at the district hospital brings us into the full reality of the human catastrophe			1
the hospital campus is overflowing with patients			1
the facility is simply not big enough to handle such calamity			1
the injured are not from the town of @entity0 , which lies near the top of one of the numerous mountain ranges			1
they are from northern part of the district , where some 200,000 people live			1
to accommodate all the casualties , the hospital built a tarpaulin shelter over the parking lot			1
at a time of our arrival , there are about 20 patients lying on mattresses on a dusty concrete floor			1
the youngest is 10 , the oldest in his 70s			1
most of them have visible wounds : deep cuts , bruised faces , broken arms and legs or spinal injuries			1
all of their faces with empty looks are still expressing the terror they went through and the pain they are suffering			1
@entity84 , 10 , sustained injuries to her face and leg when her house in the village of @entity90 partially collapsed			1
her mother was injured in the tremor			1
@entity84 is gently tended by volunteer child counselor @entity93			2
" i just found what she likes and keep repeating it			2
her injuries are fairly superficial , but she is traumatized			2
it will take some time , but she will recover , " @entity99 says			2
children usually get excited when being filmed			2
@entity84 seems almost unaware of my camera			2
little food , less optimism in @entity4 tent city the situation in the hospital 's emergency room is similar			2
all the injured are taken care of by attentive doctors and nurses			2
some have family members with them			2
despite the gravity of the situation , the atmosphere here is calm			2
@entity29 's hospital is ill - equipped to treat more serious injuries and serves mostly as a transit point			2
here , the injured get necessary first aid and as soon as possible are transferred to bigger hospitals in other districts or in @entity4			2
there are not enough ambulances , and most of the injured must travel on old buses			2
people unable to walk are transported on makeshift wooden stretchers			2
i can not even imagine traveling on the road we just came in with a broken leg or a spinal injury			2
the caws of crows above @entity0 are frequently interrupted by sounds of helicopters			1
we leave the hospital and go to check the landing zones			0
one is a sports field , and the second a flat meadow on the ridge			0
many of the damaged villages are not accessible by roads			0
to fly to most remote places from @entity0 takes about 30 minutes , five days on foot			1
the helicopters operated by @entity1 military bring tents , tarps , blankets , food and baby supplies to most damaged areas			1
they bring back the injured			0
one helicopter brings two stranded @entity162 tourists from @entity163 , a village in the @entity165			0
they are in a group of 11 trekkers from @entity168 , @entity169 and the @entity170 who remain in the valley			0
most of the helicopters are small and can only pick up two to three passengers			0
we head back to the hospital , where we meet @entity177			0
he is the head of a mission of the @entity180 , a @entity181 government agency			0
the agency 's " @entity184 " team helps the needy during disasters around the world			0
" for us , it 's most important to focus on the most vulnerable ones : mothers and children			0
women in labor who do not have a bed , women in need of a cesarean ( section ) without access to surgery facilities , " says @entity177			0
the rest of the 10 - member unit arrives from @entity4 in the evening			0
the team includes a pediatrician , a pediatric surgeon , an orthopedic surgeon , a midwife , an anesthesiologist and a gynecologist			0
within two hours , they set up two modern fully functioning operating theaters at the hospital			0
the group 's philosophy is " to support , not to invade			0
" they work very closely with staff of @entity0 's hospital			1
the @entity180 is followed by 26 members of the @entity219			0
they bring seven search dogs			0
leader @entity222 explains : " right now we focus on finding survivors			0
the chances are diminishing every hour			0
members of our team are trained medics			0
we will also assist with treating the injured			0
" all aid workers sleep in tents on hospital premises			0
on thursday , we wake up to a drizzly morning			0
heavy fog blankets surrounding slopes and mountains			0
all helicopter flights are suspended			0
people in remote areas desperately awaiting help wo n't get any today			0
but here in @entity0 , humanitarian teams are at full speed			1
@entity181 doctors along with their @entity1 colleagues perform surgeries			1
the @entity245 team heads off in a bus to villages reachable by road			0
we wish our hosts in @entity0 the best of luck and leave for @entity4 mid-afternoon			1
i had come to see how serious the situation is and how local and state authorities are coping			0
i am too overwhelmed and too exhausted to draw any conclusions			0
but i learned a lot about resilience of the @entity1 and about good people from around the world committed to help them			1
much help will be needed .			0
