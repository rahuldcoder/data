@entity1 , @entity2 even from high above , flying in an @entity5 helicopter , it is easy to see that the people of @entity1 , central @entity2 , are happy to see us			1
residents in this remote village , about a 44km drive from @entity2 's capital , @entity12 , stand on the distinctive steeply terraced hillsides and wave furiously as the relief flight passes overhead			1
the mission , a joint effort between @entity18 air crew and a @entity2 army medical team , is only the third operation of its kind to reach the village since saturday 's massive 7.8 - magnitude quake , which left more than 5,000 people dead			1
the aircraft is stuffed to capacity with tents , medicines and packages of tinned tuna , instant noodles and rice , all bundled haphazardly aboard the @entity32 by soldiers at the air base in @entity12 barely 15 minutes earlier			1
local official @entity35 is there to greet the helicopter as it touches down on a field in front of the village medical clinic , and waiting soldiers swing into action to unload the delivery			2
he says people have been desperately awaiting the supplies			2
the situation in @entity1 and the surrounding villages is " dire , " he tells @entity3 through a translator			0
according to @entity2 's @entity51 , 1,376 people were killed in @entity52 , where @entity1 is located , when the earthquake hit			2
some 18,000 houses were destroyed and 100,000 people have been displaced in the surrounding area , says @entity35			2
" everyone is sleeping outside , " he says			0
he has serious concerns about food supplies in the region , saying the piled boxes of rice and noodles are n't nearly enough to meet the needs of local people			0
" aid agencies need to do something very quickly , " he says			0
in the days since the quake , injured people from the region have been told to find their way to @entity1 so they can be picked up by the relief flights , he says			1
they 've sent about 500 of the most seriously injured people for treatment in @entity12 already -- the majority by road -- but many more are stuck in a local clinic waiting for help			1
seven of them , five women and two men , are suddenly driven onto the airfield in a truck and on the back of a pickup			0
their injuries are not life - threatening , but they look to be in a bad state : bloodied , exhausted and traumatized			0
an elderly woman 's face is covered in bandages that look like they have n't been changed in days			0
another cries in pain as she is loaded on to a stretcher from the back of the pickup , then awkwardly hoisted on to the helicopter			0
among the injured brought on board the flight is @entity101 , accompanied by her son			1
he tells @entity3 their family lives in a village called @entity106 , where nearly all the houses were destroyed			2
he and other family members carried @entity101 for four hours to reach @entity1			1
with their home destroyed and their stores of grain lost , the family are in crisis			1
as the helicopter takes off for the capital , flying over a landscape dotted with collapsed buildings and bright orange tents , @entity2 army doctor @entity116 offers perhaps the only positive for those on board			0
the patients ' injuries are mostly lacerations of varying degrees , he says			0
their vital signs are all stable , and with antibiotics and intravenous drips , they should recover			0
when the helicopter touches down at @entity133 , the patients are swiftly unloaded and unceremoniously laid out on the tarmac in the emergency triage area in front of an aircraft hangar , and paramedics scramble to administer iv drips to those in need as @entity101 's son feeds her a cracker softened with water , the relief team turn to prepare for another mission			1
how you can help victims of the @entity151 earthquake 's victims overwhelm hospitals			2

@entity5 and @entity155 medical team *launch* rescue mission to bring injured people to hospitals in @entity12
@entity101 's family carried her for four hours to reach help after she was wounded when their home was destroyed
