@entity0 , @entity1 we came on a commercial flight to @entity0			1
blue tarps were visible from the sky for people to hide under -- signs that there was something wrong			2
we had to circle the airport for a couple of hours			2
there were a couple of issues			2
there was an aftershock this afternoon , so they were checking the runway for damage			2
military and aid flights have priority , and a few military planes -- @entity26 military planes -- were going in , trying to bring in aid			0
whether they did is unclear			1
when we landed at the airport , it was wet and cold			0
a couple of thousand people were lining the road to the entrance to the airport trying to get out			0
but there 's no way to get out , really			1
there were torrential rainstorms for a couple of hours , and with the strong aftershock a couple of hours ago , no one wants to go inside			1
the residents of @entity0 sure do n't			0
you can see some structural damage to buildings			0
most buildings are not up to high construction standards			0
fallen : @entity1 's historic landmarks driving through the city , there 's not a huge amount of visible damage			1
there 's some damage to houses and buildings , but it 's not as visual as the @entity60 earthquake ( of 2010 )			1
we were able to drive the main road to the hotel we 're staying at , but they 're not allowing anyone inside because of the aftershocks			0
the guests are in a big tent used for functions on the lawn			0
there are probably about 100 people in there			0
the tents are covered , but water is seeping in from streets puddled with water , especially around the edges of the tent			1
so people are outside in the rain with no shelter			1
it 's visually stark , with people in the streets			1
it 's colder than usual this time of year			1
i 'm cold and damp			0
when it 's almost may , it 's usually much hotter			1
there 's very little power in the city -- no power to speak of , no drinking water			1
for the residents , it 's really bad			1
very soon , they will need shelter			2
temporary shelters have been put up , but very few -- 16 -- by the government			0
it looks like a city where buildings have been abandoned			0
people are hanging out in public squares and at intersections to avoid rubble from buildings			0
those who survived -- and those who did n't there are issues with fuel in the city , and driving in , all the stores were shuttered			0
you occasionally see a cart with food or a few bottles of drinking water , but for the most part , nothing is being sold in the city			1
i do n't think they 're very concerned about looting , and there 's no military in the streets , but they will have to get water and food in the city soon			1
communal kitchens have been set up for cooking			0
not by the government -- people set them up on their own			0
people are beside themselves in shock			0
their biggest concern now is the structures , needing a place for shelter , to hide from the elements and sleep			2
food will become the biggest concern in the coming days			2
@entity0 is n't the epicenter though			2
no one 's sure what it 's like at the epicenter			1
people have n't been able to get to outlying areas			0
we have n't been able to corroborate this , but the people we 're talking to here say there 's damage to the villages outside @entity0 -- thousands of houses damaged to the north , closer to the epicenter			1
@entity2 's @entity163 reported from @entity0 and @entity164 wrote in @entity165 .			2

the earthquake that struck @entity1 has left thousands of @entity168 without shelter
torrential rains making situation worse ; food and drinking water supplies could become a serious issue soon
it 's unclear how bad conditions are closer to the epicenter
