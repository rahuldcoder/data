@entity0 finally answered the question we 've all been asking for years : will she run for president in 2016 ? with official news of her candidacy just hours old , one thing is already crystal clear : for the next year and a half , @entity10 will be the barometer by which we assess gender equality in the @entity15			1
win or lose , this creates a burden for her that no male candidate will ever have to shoulder			2
just consider the two potential outcomes			2
a win would mean a woman in the @entity23 , which is a vital step in the march toward women 's full political inclusion			1
but it 's possible that the march will end right there			1
we 'll break our arms patting ourselves on the back for how far we 've come			2
we 'll raise the " @entity34 " banner over the women 's movement			1
and we 'll call it a day			2
granted , 80 % of elected officials throughout the country will still be men			2
women will continue to be less likely than men even to consider running for office			1
and pay inequities , sexual assault and human trafficking will persist as challenges that no one person can solve , no matter how hard @entity10 might try			2
" but we 've elected a woman as president , " we 'll say			2
let her take care of it			2
a loss would be even more difficult			2
@entity10 will be blamed for running a subpar campaign regardless of how brilliant her strategy is			0
more generally , her loss would perpetuate the myth that women can not win big elections , that the electoral environment is rife with bias and discrimination , and that women must be twice as good to get half as far			1
" if @entity0 ca n't win an election , " potential female candidates will ask , " how can i ? " extrapolating from one female candidate 's experiences to women in politics more broadly is always suspect			1
but in the case of @entity10 , it is particularly flawed for at least two fundamental reasons			0
first , @entity10 is no ordinary female presidential candidate , if there is such a thing			0
she began the 2008 race with levels of name recognition that many candidates never achieve , and she is even more well - known today			0
but that means that she also enters the electoral arena with 23 years of public accomplishments and 23 years of well - publicized baggage			0
voters , donors , journalists and pundits all hold clear impressions of @entity10 before she ever eats a corn dog in @entity92 , steps onto a debate stage in @entity94 or takes a shot of bourbon in @entity97			0
too often , we treat @entity10 's loss to @entity100 in the 2008 @entity102 primary as a referendum on how citizens feel about electing women to positions of political power			1
in reality , what people knew about @entity0 likely shaped their views of @entity0			1
widespread sexism and misogyny likely did not			0
after all , for decades , women who have run for office have performed just as well as men			1
they win elections at equal rates and routinely raise comparable amounts of money			0
do some voters still question women 's suitability as leaders ? of course they do			1
but these attitudes , which have become increasingly rare , do not translate into systematic biases against female candidates			0
second , presidential politics is , first and foremost , a partisan affair			0
the @entity129 or r in front of the candidates ' names -- not the @entity134 or y chromosomes in their dna -- tells us about how more than 90 % of the population will vote			1
party polarization has essentially rendered the importance of sex on the campaign trail far less relevant than might otherwise be the case			0
now , i 'll be the first to predict that by the middle of the week , we will be able to assemble a reel of sexist comments uttered by pundits , and we will be one mouse click away from a steady stream of misogynistic memes , photos and captions that have taken hold on social media			0
the @entity10 campaign will once again have to determine which incidents to address , which to ignore and how to preempt future episodes			0
i do n't want to diminish the problems associated with this type of behavior or the fact that it is inappropriate , disrespectful and appalling			0
and incorporating these concerns into a broad campaign strategy is likely something that male candidates wo n't need to consider			0
but men yelling " iron my shirt " at a campaign rally , cable news pundits associating @entity10 with their ex-wives outside of probate court and manufacturers producing @entity0 nutcrackers do not change the fact that when it comes to presidential elections , partisanship and the state of the economy tell us almost everything we need to know			1
if @entity10 wins the race , it will be because it was a good year for @entity102			0
and if she loses , it will be because the @entity188 developed a winning message			0
but how much does any of this really matter ? sure , voters are amenable to electing women			1
any @entity102 nominee would face the same electoral landscape			0
the problems confronting women in society are just as grave regardless of who occupies the @entity23			1
and inferring too much from @entity0 's experiences is a risky endeavor			1
yet the minute @entity10 announced her candidacy , she became the official litmus test for true gender equality in the @entity15			1
that 's a label that no female candidate should have to wear			1
let the burden begin .			0

@entity208 : there 's a strong *temptation* to view @entity0 's candidacy as all about cracking the glass ceiling for women
she says the reality is that most people will vote not on gender but on the economy and partisanship
