it 's easy to be anxious about the threat posed by the @entity3			1
after all , this is a brutal organization that not only kills but seems to revel in doing so in ways designed to shock the world -- from the beheadings of journalists to burning a @entity11 pilot alive			2
such moves are part of this murky group 's propaganda and its deliberate efforts to manipulate information			0
so what can and should we make of the organization ? i explore the issue in depth in a special airing sunday night			0
and although it 's important to start with the caveat that @entity3 is indeed trying to scare and confuse us , i took away some tentative lessons from speaking with the people who have traveled inside the minds of @entity3			1
first , @entity3 is clearly about religion -- its version of radical @entity33 -- but it is also about power			1
there is increasing evidence that the military backbone of @entity3 is made up not by a group of @entity3 zealots , but rather high - ranking officers from @entity43 's army -- baathists who were at least ostensibly secular			1
an internal @entity3 report detailing its organizational structure was reported on last week in the @entity49 weekly @entity48			1
that report describes a group that uses its religious ideology as a recruiting and governing philosophy , much like communism			0
but underneath it , much like communism , is simply a drive for control , a lust for power			0
next , @entity3 presents itself as a global organization , but it has thrived because of a local cause			1
the group has gained territory , cash and recruits primarily because of the rage and rebellion of the @entity68 of @entity69 and @entity70 , who believe they must fight the @entity71 to secure their own survival and strength			1
the reality is that that @entity68 cause is going to endure for some time			1
the @entity76 has been successful in its tactical battles against @entity3 and has managed to push the group back from many of its gains in @entity69			1
but the @entity68 of the region will remain in rebellion and the @entity68 - dominated areas will remain in turmoil -- chaos that @entity3 will be able to capitalize on this chaos			1
in the long run , @entity3 might very well find that its greatest foes lie within its so - called caliphate			2
the few reports that are emerging from areas controlled by @entity3 suggest that , unsurprisingly , people do not like living under a brutal , theocratic dictatorship			2
they live in fear , and even those who chose it as an alternative to @entity71 rule are growing disenchanted			0
in this respect , @entity3 is like other radical @entity3 groups , such as the @entity102 -- they have an allure in the abstract , but once they are actually governing in their medieval , barbarous manner , the allure fades and the disenchantment builds			2
the result is ever - increasing repression			0
remember , no one has ever voted isis into power anywhere			0
the group simply slaughters its way to control			0
of course , one of the big questions has been : is @entity3 a threat to the @entity116 ? the group 's leaders declare that it is			1
but their ambitions appear to be mostly centered on their @entity121 enemies , on building a caliphate in @entity69 and @entity70			1
they understand , of course , that to be @entity127 no. 1 , they must battle the country that is the world 's no. 1 power -- the @entity76			0
with that in mind , they seek such a confrontation and hope that the @entity76 will come to the @entity135 and fight them on their terms , on their terrain			0
still , while they are opportunists , and they ask and hope that their followers act in @entity76 , their main focus is not to come here -- they want @entity76 to go there			0
yet no matter how one rates the level of the threat @entity3 poses , the group has changed the nature of terror			2
the leaders of @entity3 have recognized that above all , they are a messaging machine , which in turn becomes a recruitment machine			1
this means that the key is not what happens on the ground , but on the airwaves and in the bits and bytes of the @entity162			0
and @entity3 does this better than anyone before them because while their gruesome videos would seem a repulsive turn - off -- and are to most -- they still work on the web			2
the shock and awe they produce makes them go viral , and thus are seen by tens of millions			0
that ensures that these videos attract those utterly alienated young men -- a few thousand among the world 's 1.6 billion @entity177 -- who seek revenge , glory and gore			0
unfortunately , as long as those young @entity177 men , scattered across the globe , are attracted to @entity3 and stream to its cause , the group presents the world with a danger that is impossible to fully assess but is one that grows by the month .			2
