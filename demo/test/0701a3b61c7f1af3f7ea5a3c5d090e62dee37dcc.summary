soon , @entity0 will be too fat to fight			1
forget about rampant diabetes , heart attacks and joint problems -- the scariest consequence arising out of our losing battle with the bulge is the safety of our country			2
in about five years , so many young @entity0 will be grossly overweight that the military will be unable to recruit enough qualified soldiers			1
that alarming forecast comes from @entity14 , gen. @entity15 , who is in charge of @entity17			2
obesity , he told me , " is becoming a national security issue			1
" i was so taken aback by @entity15 's statement that i felt the need to press him			1
come on ! obesity ? a national security crisis ? @entity26 did n't blink			1
" in my view , yes			2
" of the 195,000 young men and women who signed up to fight for our country , only 72,000 qualified			1
some did n't make the cut because they had a criminal background , or a lack of education , or too many tattoos			2
but a full 10 % did n't qualify because they were overweight			2
before you accuse me of sensationalizing , it 's that 10 % figure that worries @entity43 the most			1
" the obesity issue is the most troubling because the trend is going in the wrong direction , " he said			1
" we think by 2020 it could be as high as 50 % , which mean only 2 in 10 would qualify to join the @entity51			2
" it 's a sad testament to who we are as a society right now			1
" the problem is so worrisome for the @entity51 that recruiters have become fitness coaches , like the trainers on the @entity60 show , " @entity61			1
" yes , your tax dollars pay for @entity51 recruiters to play @entity65 or @entity66 to whip could - be recruits into shape with the hope they can diet and exercise their way to become real recruits			2
if they lose enough weight , they 're sent to boot camp			2
some make it ; many do n't			2
but , @entity79 told me the @entity51 must try			2
" we are the premier leader on personal development in the world , " he told me			0
" we want to see you grow and become a leader			0
that is a great strength in our @entity51			0
" except the @entity51 never considered the type of growth it 's now contending with			1
nowadays " personal development " means working on both character and ... girth			0
the general , along with so many others in this country , is struggling with why so many @entity0 , despite all the warnings , continue to eat too much and exercise too little			1
but it 's got to be true : we just do n't care			1
" the acceptance of obesity is prevalent , " according to @entity104 , an obstetrician and gynecologist who believes obesity is a national crisis right now			1
" when you look around you , 70 % of adults are overweight or obese			0
it 's seems normal , " she said			1
just look at the numbers : more than one - third of @entity0 adults are obese			1
seventeen percent of all children and adolescents in the @entity0 are obese			1
that 's triple the rate from just a generation ago			1
so , maybe we should face the fact that we 've grown comfortable with our girth			0
it is crystal clear we have n't the foggiest idea of who needs to lose weight and who does n't			0
just the other day , @entity129 trolls scolded the singer , @entity130 , for gaining weight			0
@entity130 is not remotely fat			0
neither is @entity133 , haters			0
if 70 % of us are overweight in this country , why are there so many willing to fat - shame people who are not remotely obese ? maybe it 's easier to criticize others for carrying extra weight than to admit we have a weight problem ourselves			1
because it is abundantly clear we are wallowing in denial			0
dr. @entity147 points to one of @entity150 's medical questionnaires			1
you know , the paperwork patients are asked to fill out before they see the doctor			0
there is actually a box on the form that allows the patient to " opt out of talking about obesity			1
" some patients refuse to step on the scale			0
" you want to be sensitive to that patient , " @entity147 told me			0
" you do n't want to nag			0
but , doctors need to step in and say we need to fix this			0
" @entity1 's chief medical correspondent , dr. @entity168 , agrees with @entity147			1
" perceptions of weight are a big part of the problem , " he said to me			1
" if a person is overweight -- as difficult as it is -- they ought to be told			0
you know , this issue reminds me of the issue with concussions			2
we should call them what they really are : a brain injury , not ' getting your bell rung			0
' in the same vein , we should tell people who are overweight or obese that , clinically , they 're ' overweight ' or ' obese ' and at risk for just about every chronic disease in the book			0
" in other words , chubby is not the proper way to describe a person who is obese			0
just like " fat " is not the proper term for @entity130 or @entity133			0
and , yes , semantics matter			0
according to the @entity201 , 81 % of overweight boys and 71 % of overweight girls believe they are just the right weight			0
we 've clearly lost our perspective on what 's normal when it comes to a healthy weight			2
so much so it 's becoming a national security problem			1
so what will it take ? the answer can not be the @entity51 .			0

in a few years , the military will be unable to recruit enough qualified soldiers because of @entity0 's obesity problem
@entity218 : we have a serious national security issue at hand , but it 's within our control if we could own up to it
