@entity1 it 's not just @entity3			1
around the world , we 're becoming collectively more near - sighted			1
near - sightedness , or myopia , means nearby objects appear clearly , but those farther away look blurry			1
the rates of myopia have doubled , even tripled , in most of @entity3 over the last 40 years , researchers say			1
several places like @entity1 , @entity12 and @entity13 have rates in the 80 %			1
in @entity17 , myopia rates among 20 - year - olds have leaped from 18 % in 1955 to over 96 % myopia in 2011			1
and it 's a global issue -- rates of myopia are also rising in @entity23 nations like @entity24 and the @entity25			1
" it 's about 40 % in the @entity25 , compared to about 25 % in the 1970s , " said dr. @entity26 , clinical spokesperson for the @entity27			1
but researchers say reducing risk of myopia is easy , free and readily - available : get some sunlight			1
sometimes , though , the easiest solutions are the hardest to implement			0
the epidemic of myopia amongst @entity36 has triggered cultural questions about why so many young people develop vision problems			1
many have long believed that reading , studying or staring at your phone caused short - sightedness			1
and there 's the usual grumblings that young people spend way too much time glued to their screens			1
but researchers are focusing on a different cause			0
" if children get outside enough , it does n't matter how much they study they do			0
they do n't become myopic , " said @entity52 , researcher at @entity53			0
researchers say kids and teens need to get sunlight during the critical years of their development while their eyeballs are still growing			1
the mechanics of how sunlight protects their eyes are not clearly understood			0
one theory suggests that sunlight triggers the release of dopamine in the retina ; another speculates that blue light from the sun protects from the condition			0
have kids " spend more time outside , have less demands ( from ) the schools and relax a bit , " said @entity77 , professor of epidemiology at the @entity79			2
but studying and play time are often at odds with each other			2
in @entity84 cultures where there is heavy emphasis on education and hyper - competitiveness , forcing playtime is easier said than done			2
" the problem is teachers and parents are probably not going to let kids , " said dr. @entity90 , professor at the @entity91 at the @entity92 in @entity93			2
" there 's a limit to how many hours kids can go outside			2
" there have been some attempts to protect children 's eyesight			0
in @entity93 , students have been mandated by its education ministry to perform daily eye exercises			0
since 1963 , rows of students sit at their desks and massage the pressure points around their eyes as a revolutionary - era anthem blares through the @entity113			2
despite these eye exercises , rates of myopia in urban @entity93 have soared to nearly 90 % , according to recent studies			1
" @entity93 has among the highest rates of myopia and it 's the only country in the world that does eye exercises , so it 's probably not working all that well , " said @entity90			1
their effectiveness has been doubted by experts in @entity93 , but the exercises remain a part of the students ' daily experience			0
myopia may seem like a minor inconvenience			2
people have to deal with glasses , contact lenses and even laser eye surgery			0
but researchers say there are serious implications of such high rates of myopia among young people			1
in @entity12 , 82 % of 20 - year - olds are myopic			1
by the time these young adults hit their 60s , many of their vision problems are likely to get worse			2
" they grow older and the epidemic is then in older adults , " said @entity77 , head of the myopia unit at the @entity149			2
as people age , they can become at higher risk for severe eye disorders such as high myopia , glaucoma ( optic nerve damage ) , cataracts ( clouding of the lens ) and retinal detachment			2
these conditions could lead to vision loss and blindness			0
to negotiate the expectations of parents and classes , researchers are experimenting ways to help students get increased exposure to sunlight			0
one of the studies underway is the " bright light classroom " where the school 's walls and ceilings are made of see - through plastic that allows in light			0
hundreds of students attend this unusual elementary school in @entity183 province			0
" it 's a potential way to increase the amount of light , in hopes of preventing myopia and allow kids to continue ( their ) education without inconvenience for them , " @entity52 said			1
researchers want to measure the rates of myopia among students in these " bright light classrooms " compared with those in traditional classes			1
building schools costs money -- especially experimental see - through schools			0
but researchers say there are low - cost solutions			0
in one @entity13 study , teachers locked the students out of the classroom during recess and lunch time			0
in that 2013 study , students boosted their time in sunlight by 80 minutes during the school day			0
fewer children in that school became nearsighted compared with those from another school that did n't follow such a policy			0
researchers hope with greater understanding of this condition , far - sighted policies could save the next generation of children 's eyesight .			0

@entity3 sees soaring rates of myopia , with 80 - 90 % of young adult *population* *affected*
*evidence* that myopia rates are increasing in @entity236 and the @entity25
*scientists* *advice* for kids : go outside and play
