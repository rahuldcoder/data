@entity1 life seen swimming in unusual places			1
water temperatures warmer than they should be			1
no snow where there should be feet of it			1
some scientists are saying " @entity12 " could be playing a factor			1
as monikers go , the blob does n't sound very worrisome			2
but if you 're a salmon fisherman in @entity16 or a @entity18 resident hoping to see the end of the drought , the blob could become an enemy of top concern			1
a @entity24 climate scientist and his associates have been studying the blob -- a huge area of unusually warm water in the @entity29 -- for months			1
" in the fall of 2013 and early 2014 we started to notice a big , almost circular mass of water that just did n't cool off as much as it usually did , so by spring of 2014 it was warmer than we had ever seen it for that time of year , " said @entity30 , who works at the @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity16			1
@entity30 , who gave the blob its name , said it was 1,000 miles long , 1,000 miles wide and 100 yards deep in 2014 -- and it has grown this year			1
and it 's not the only one ; there are two others that emerged in 2014 , @entity44 of the @entity45 -- part of the @entity47 ( @entity47 ) -- said in september			2
one is in the @entity48 and the other is off the coast of @entity18			0
waters in the blob have been warmer by about 5.5 degrees , a significant rise			1
a recent set of studies published in @entity56 by @entity30 's group points to a high - pressure ridge over the @entity59 that has calmed ocean waters for two winters			1
the result was more heat staying in the water because storms did n't kick up and help cool the surface water			2
" the warmer temperatures we see now are n't due to more heating , but less winter cooling , " a recent news release from the @entity24 announcing the studies said			2
the university has worked with @entity47 on the research			0
according to @entity76 magazine , some marine species are exploring the warmer waters , leading some fish to migrate hundreds of miles from their normal habitats			1
the magazine cited fisherman and wildlife officials in @entity84 who have seen skipjack tuna and thresher sharks			0
@entity88 killer whales have been spotted off the coast of @entity16			0
" i 've never seen some of these species here before , " @entity90 of the @entity91 in @entity32 told the @entity76			0
and he was worried about the adult @entity29 salmon that normally feed on tiny crustaceans and other food sources that are not around in the same numbers off the coast of the @entity99			1
" they had nothing to eat , " he told the magazine of last year 's conditions in the blob			0
it appears that food has moved to cooler waters			1
in january , @entity30 told the @entity108 in @entity109 , @entity16 , that his concern is for very young salmon that are still upstream			0
" in particular , the year class that would be going to sea next spring , " he said			0
@entity47 said in a news release last month that @entity18 sea lion pups have been found extremely underweight and dying , possibly because of an ocean with fewer things to eat			0
" we have been seeing emaciated or dehydrated sea lions show up on beaches , " @entity120 , assistant stranding coordinator for @entity47 on the @entity59 , told @entity2			1
the numbers are overwhelming facilities that care for the stranded sea lions , most of whom are pups , local officials said			0
record number of sea lion pups stranded in @entity18 the blob also is affecting life on land			2
for the past few years , that persistent ridge of high pressure has kept the @entity59 dry and warm , exacerbating the drought in @entity18 , @entity138 and @entity16			1
one of the primary problems is small snow accumulation in the mountains			2
in early april , officials measured the snowpack in @entity18 at a time when it should be the highest			0
this year it hit an all - time low at 1.4 inches of water content in the snow , just 5 % of the annual average			1
the previous low for april 1 had been 25 % in 1977 and 2014			0
( pdf ) gov. @entity153 , in announcing water restrictions the same day , stood on a patch of dry , brown grass in the @entity157 mountains that is usually blanketed by up to 5 feet of snow			1
low @entity18 snowpack ushers mandatory water restrictions the heat has caused rising air , which can lead to conditions that produce more thunderstorms			2
with warmer air in @entity18 , areas at higher elevations that usually see snow have seen rain instead			1
that has led to the lower snowpack and helped compound the drought			2
the storms also mean more lightning and more wildfires			0
and the blob affects people on other areas of the country			0
that same persistent jet stream pattern has allowed cold air to spill into much of the @entity182 and @entity183			0
this stuck pattern has led to the record cold and snow in the @entity182 and @entity187 over the last two seasons with record snows we have seen in @entity191 and @entity192 , and the most snow we have seen in decades for cities such as @entity195			2
the weather pattern is confusing the experts			0
there are some that think it might be a @entity202 , a long - lasting @entity204 - like pattern in the @entity29			1
@entity205 , a professor of atmospheric science at the @entity24 , does n't believe the answer is clear			0
" i do n't think we know ... " he said in the university 's news release			0
" maybe it will go away quickly and we wo n't talk about it anymore , but if it persists for a third year , then we 'll know something really unusual is going on			0
" @entity2 's @entity215 contributed to this report .			0

waters in a huge area of the @entity29 are running 5.5 degrees warmer than normal
@entity1 life that likes cooler water has moved and others that like warm seas are seen in new places
" @entity12 " might be having an effect on rain and snow -- and the @entity59 drought
