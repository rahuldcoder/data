@entity0 former rap mogul @entity2 was ordered thursday to stand trial for murder and other charges stemming from a deadly hit - and - run confrontation on the movie set of the biopic " @entity8 " earlier this year			1
in addition to that ruling , judge @entity9 also lowered @entity2 's bail to $ 10 million from $ 25 million , a figure that defense lawyers called excessive			1
the judge also dismissed one of the two counts of hit - and - run against @entity2			1
in all , @entity2 will stand trial on one count of murder , one count of attempted murder and one count of hit - and - run , the judge ruled after holding a two - day preliminary hearing this week that ended thursday			1
@entity2 , 49 , faces up to life in prison if convicted			1
@entity2 suffers diabetes and blot clots , and the case has clearly strained him : he collapsed in court last month after learning of the $ 25 million bail and he was taken to the hospital for treatment			1
@entity2 was in court thursday			1
at the end of hearing , he turned around and looked at his family in the gallery , and he smiled to his fiancee as deputies led him handcuffed out of the courtroom			0
in a press conference after the hearing , fiancee @entity44 said regarding @entity2 's health that he is " doing much better			2
" the judge dismissed the other hit - and - run count because @entity51 law says no more than one charge of hit - and - run should be brought against a defendant when the same weapon , in this case the vehicle @entity2 was driving , is used against several people			1
@entity2 is accused of running over two men , killing one of them , during an argument			2
killed was @entity62 , 55			0
the survivor is @entity64 , 51 , who in testimony this week declined to identify @entity2 as his attacker because @entity64 does n't want to be a " snitch " who sends @entity2 to prison , according to @entity1 affiliates kabc and @entity71			2
prosecutors offered @entity64 immunity , but he still refused to testify against @entity2 on monday , the affiliates reported			2
the deadly incident happened on january 29 , after a flare - up on the set of the biopic " @entity8 , " a film about the highly influential and controversial rap group @entity81 the alleged argument spilled over to the parking lot of @entity84 in @entity85			2
at the time , @entity2 was out on bail in a separate robbery case			1
the hit - and - run was captured on videotape and allegedly shows @entity2 inside a red truck			1
in the video , the truck pulls into the entrance of the @entity85 restaurant , and he is then approached by @entity64 , who was working security on the site			0
the two men appear to talk for a few moments , with @entity2 still in his vehicle			2
suddenly , the vehicle backs up , knocking @entity64 to the ground			0
while still in reverse , the truck moves out of range of the security camera			0
the vehicle is then seen zooming forward , back into camera range , running over @entity64 a second time , and then running over a second man , @entity62 , a former rap music label owner			0
in closing arguments prior to the judge 's ruling , @entity2 's attorney @entity109 argued that @entity2 was the victim			1
@entity2 was only defending himself against @entity64 , whom the defense attorney accused of possessing a gun at the time			2
" mr. @entity64 is the initial and consistent aggressor , " @entity2 's attorney argued			2
" there 's no intent to kill , there 's an intent to survive			0
" " even without a gun , we know mr. @entity64 was brave enough to attack in broad daylight , " the defense attorney said			0
@entity109 added that @entity2 's defense was to stand his ground			0
@entity64 " needed immunity because he was the actual aggressor , " @entity109 said			0
" he is the person who got @entity62 ( @entity130 ) killed			0
" @entity132 deputy district attorney @entity131 argued , however , told the judge that @entity2 was engaged in " mutual combat situation " where he used his car as deadly weapon			1
if @entity2 " ever had the right of self - defense , the moment he backed - up and mr. @entity64 was ran - over , he lost the right of self - defense , " @entity131 said			1
" there was pre-mediation and intent when he ( @entity2 ) ran over him a second time			0
" @entity2 is scheduled to be arraigned on april 30			0
the incident is the latest run - in with the law for @entity2 , who founded the wildly successful @entity149 in 1991 and signed artists such as @entity151 ( now known as @entity151 ) and @entity152			1
@entity2 was driving the car in which @entity152 was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in @entity156 in 1996			0
shortly afterward , @entity2 spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions			0
that prison time -- along with @entity152 's death , feuds between @entity2 and a number of rappers , and desertions by @entity165 , @entity151 and others -- contributed to the label 's bankruptcy in 2006			0
in august , @entity2 and two other people were shot while inside a celebrity - filled @entity173 party hosted by singer @entity174 on the eve of the @entity176 .			1
