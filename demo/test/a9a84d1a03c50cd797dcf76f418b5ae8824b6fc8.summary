@entity1 it 's with some trepidation that i set off for the @entity6 camel race in @entity1			1
as the only @entity8 national in the @entity2 team , i am expected to be familiar with camel racing , an ancient tradition in the region			1
but despite my attempts to dress in a kandora , a @entity18 national dress , my modern outlook on life means i am a total outsider in this world			1
a cheerful farm owner leads us inside the majlis -- meeting area -- where the camel owners are gathering			2
the wide space of the majlis feels like an ornate theater			0
the camel owners are sitting on the floor , eating the a'aish , a traditional @entity32 dish of fish and rice , laid out in front of them			2
the conversation is loud and exciting			0
we take our place on the floor and slowly , the world of camel racing begins to open up to us			1
the conversation is all about camels ; the best breeds , famous old champions , training methods , bad losers and potential winners			2
over @entity32 coffee and dates i am told that remote controlled robots have replaced children as camel jockeys -- this primal sport is moving with the times			1
once lunch is over , we head to the track for the racing to begin			2
there will be 14 races through the afternoon			0
and in addition to the honor and prestige , the camels are racing for thousands of dollars in prize money and fancy new cars for their owners			1
it 's surprising how spectacular camel racing can be			1
compared to the grace of thoroughbred racehorses , camels are indeed ungainly creatures			0
but 20 of these huge beasts pounding around a track in the desert is really a sight to behold , their hooves throwing up a cloud of dust in their wake			0
their owners hang out of their four - by - fours , shouting encouragement while trying to keep up with their charges			0
the winning camels are paraded with pride , their heads and necks covered in bright golden saffron and their owners applauded for their efforts and rewarded with cash prizes			0
as we excitedly watch the final race draw to a close , the sun sets across the sky of this metropolis			0
camel racing bears no relevance to the modernity embraced here , but this old - fashioned sport is equally as fascinating .			1

camel racing is a *centuries* - old tradition in the @entity8
modern *technology* is *changing* the sport
