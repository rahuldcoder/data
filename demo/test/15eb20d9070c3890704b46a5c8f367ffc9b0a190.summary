@entity4 after weeks of dramatic and emotionally wrenching testimony in the @entity3 trial , jurors deliberated for more than seven hours tuesday			1
but they have n't reached a verdict yet			1
the jurors sent out two questions , which are scheduled to be addressed when they return to court wednesday morning			1
@entity10 , the 21 - year - old accused @entity13 bomber , faces life in prison or the death penalty			1
on monday , the jury saw a video of the moment a bomb exploded and disemboweled an 8 - year - old boy and ripped the leg off his sister			1
the blast killed a 23 - year - old graduate student from @entity25			1
the jurors heard more horror from april 15 , 2013			1
at one point , prosecutors played a video that showed the scene after a bomb exploded -- blood and injured victims everywhere and the sounds of a child howling			1
his mother lost her leg			1
" the defendant brought terrorism into the backyards and main streets , " assistant u.s. attorney @entity40 said			2
" the defendant thought that his values were more important than the people around him			2
he wanted to awake the mujahedeen , the holy warriors , so he chose @entity49 , marathon monday , " a time for families to gather and watch the marathon			2
@entity10 's defense attorney @entity53 tried to persuade jurors that her client 's older brother , 26 - year - old @entity55 , who died in a shootout with police days after the terror attack , was the instigator of the marathon plot			1
the younger man , @entity62 said , was only following his older brother			2
" if not for @entity55 , it would not have happened , " @entity62 argued			2
bomb survivors and victims ' family members wiped away tears and comforted one another in court			2
@entity10 fidgeted at the defense table as he has done throughout the trial			1
@entity74 , father of bomb victim @entity75 , 8 , craned his neck to watch @entity10 as the prosecutor spoke			1
@entity10 " chose a day when the eyes of the world would be on @entity4 , " @entity40 said			1
" he chose a day when there would be civilians on the sidewalks , and he targeted those civilians : men , women and children			1
" the lawyer waited a beat			2
" he wanted to terrorize this country			2
he wanted to punish @entity89 for what it was doing to his people			2
" the prosecutor showed a picture of @entity10 and his brother , @entity55 , in the marathon crowd			1
the day of the bombings , @entity40 said , " they felt they were soldiers			1
they were the mujahedeen and they were bringing their battle to @entity4			2
" @entity10 is accused of 30 counts , including setting off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism			1
seventeen of those counts carry a sentence of death or life imprisonment			2
if @entity10 is found guilty of at least one of the 17 capital counts , the trial will proceed to a second phase , the so - called penalty phase			1
that part of the trial will include evidence of aggravating and mitigating factors , and the jury will be asked to weigh elements that make this crime especially heinous against details from @entity10 's background and mental health history that would weigh in his favor			1
since testimony began march 4 , federal prosecutors have called 92 witnesses , and the defense just four			2
it seemed a mismatch from the start			2
" he was there , " @entity62 conceded as the trial opened , but the defense strategy always had been to focus on persuading the jury to spare @entity10 's life			1
jurors were shown a photo of @entity10 standing by a tree behind the family of @entity75			1
" these children were n't innocent to him , " the prosecutor said			2
he knew what that bag was designed to do			2
" @entity40 quoted @entity75 's father who earlier testified , " i guess we were just unlucky that day			1
" but luck had nothing to do with the @entity4 bombings , the prosecutor said			2
" this was a cold , intentional , terrorist act , " he said			2
the brothers ' acts that day were intended , he said , " to make a point			1
to tell @entity89 , ' we wo n't be terrorized by you anymore			0
' " the defense has maintained that @entity10 , who was 19 and flunking out of college at the @entity166 , @entity167 , fell under the sway of his older , more radicalized brother			1
" in the past few weeks , we have come face to face with tragedy , suffering and grief in dimensions none of us could imagine , " @entity62 said			0
" we 've heard words , we 've heard screams and we 've heard cries			0
for this suffering and pain , there is no excuse			0
" she acknowledged her client participated in a " senseless act			0
" @entity55 , a @entity186 boxer , had hoped to wage jihad , and his slacker younger brother was just along for the ride , the defense has maintained			0
during the 15 - minute rebuttal period , prosecutor @entity191 told jurors not to be distracted by the defense 's " attempt to point the finger at somebody else			1
" " there should be no doubt in your mind that the defendant and his brother are equally guilty , " he said			1
they were " partners in crime			0
" @entity191 pointed out that after the bombing , @entity10 went to the grocery store			1
" @entity55 did n't turn his brother into a murderer			0
to shred the bodies of women and children with a homemade type of bomb , you have to be different from other people , " the prosecutor said			0
" if you are capable of such hate , such callousness that you can murder and maim 20 people and then drive to @entity220 and buy some milk , can you really blame it on your brother ? " the radicalization of @entity10 from the start , prosecutors presented a compelling case in which the horrors of april 15 to 19 , 2013 , were vividly brought to life once again			1
they began with the stories of bombing survivors and first responders , who described acts of courage and compassion amid madness and chaos			0
the final moments of the three @entity13 spectators who died were recounted by the people who were by their sides			0
according to testimony , @entity55 set off a bomb made from a 6 - quart pressure cooker , explosive powder from fireworks , duct tape , nails and bbs on @entity250 near the finish line			1
that bomb , which exploded near @entity253 , claimed the life of @entity255 , a 29 - year - old restaurant manager			0
twelve seconds later , @entity10 allegedly detonated a second , similar bomb outside the @entity257 , slightly more than a block away			1
that blast killed the boy , @entity75 , and @entity261 , 23 , a graduate student from @entity25			0
@entity40 's voice grew soft monday as he recalled the victims : @entity75 's 69 - pound body " was shattered , broken , eviscerated , burned			0
there was n't a part of this boy 's body that was n't destroyed			0
" @entity261 " received blast injuries all over her body			0
her leg was torn open , and she bled out			0
" @entity255 died in less than a minute from " massive blast injuries to her lower extremities			0
parts of her body were shredded			0
" @entity278 , the @entity280 campus police officer killed three days after the bombings , " never had a chance			0
" he was shot between the eyes			0
" the brothers allegedly killed the 26 - year - old officer for his service weapon but could n't pry it loose from a safety holster			0
case ends with grisly photos and testimony @entity292 told the jury about his frightening 90 minutes with two carjackers , one who admitted being involved in the marathon bombing			0
he identified that person as @entity55			0
police fired 210 rounds at the brothers when they tracked a gps device in @entity292 's stolen @entity301 and cornered them in @entity303 , @entity304			0
@entity10 struck @entity55 , who was wounded , when he charged police in the car			1
@entity55 died of his injuries			0
" @entity55 wanted suicide by cop , " the prosecutor said monday			0
" he was ready for heaven			0
but the defendant had other plans			0
" @entity10 ditched the stolen car and sought shelter in a dry - docked boat parked in a trailer in a backyard in @entity303			1
as he hid , he used a pencil to scrawl what prosecutors called a " manifesto " in which he said he was jealous of his brother for dying as a martyr and reaching paradise			0
he also lashed out at the @entity89 for policies he said killed @entity328 , writing , " i ca n't stand to see such evil go unpunished			0
we @entity328 are one body , you hurt one you hurt us all			0
" federal prosecutors also presented evidence gleaned from searches of the brothers ' computers , including militant literature written by top @entity340 leaders			0
and they traced the purchase of the pressure cookers , ammunition and bbs , which appeared to have been made by @entity55			0
