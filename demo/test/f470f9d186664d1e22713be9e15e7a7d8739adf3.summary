# @entity1 ? that 's the trending question on social media , thanks to a photo of a cat coming down some stairs			1
or is it going up some stairs ? ( and you thought you were done with this kind of optical illusion free - for - all after # @entity13			1
) the picture was apparently uploaded on @entity15 a few days ago and has caught fire thanks to a post on the website 9gag.com			0
some people are noting the apparent motion of the cat			1
others are commenting about the construction of the stairs			0
( nobody has mentioned that some cats we could name would be more likely to stop in the middle of the steps and play with a mousie			0
) of course , where there 's public debate , there are advertisers waiting to take advantage of the situation			2
taxes ? now , those are really confusing .			0

the @entity41 is raging about a cat going # @entity1
