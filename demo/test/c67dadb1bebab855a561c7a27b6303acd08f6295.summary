" it really depends what you want			0
boy ? girl ? @entity6 ? old ? " the man on the phone was offering us young children with the casualness of a market trader			1
after a week of back and forth phone calls , his initial caginess had given way to greed			0
he 'd heard my foreign accent and clearly decided i would pay more than the domestic rate			0
" we can get , " he said			0
we 'd been put in touch with the man through a contact on the ground			1
we were told he was one of the men running this " unofficial " displaced camp -- one of the many that has mushroomed in the town of @entity32 as the influx of people fleeing @entity35 has grown beyond the capacity of the official camps			1
it had all been heartbreakingly simple			0
we 'd asked who had children available to " foster " -- a catch - all code word designed to conceal the true intent of those offering up the orphaned children			1
the man on the phone was the end result of those inquiries			1
when our colleague want to see them , he was shown a group of children and asked which one he wanted to take			1
one , two maybe ? he escaped by saying he needed to check with his " madam " -- me			0
the man picked up and began referring to me as " sister			1
" i told him we wanted to know what we 'd need to do , if we decided we did want to " foster " the children			1
he told me , " @entity63 , @entity62 will reward me , " so the " fostering " was free , he said			0
no need for any pesky paperwork -- just a reassurance from me that the children , if i chose to take them , would " live in my heart			1
" if i could also then find it " in my heart " to donate to those still in the camp , then that would be " @entity75 's work			1
" in spite of the harsh measures the @entity79 government has put in place to punish human traffickers , by the government 's own admission , 8 million children are currently engaged in forced labor			1
the @entity86 says @entity79 has the highest number of people in modern slavery of any @entity91 country			0
paradoxically , the group also rates @entity79 's anti-trafficking agency , @entity94 , as one of the strongest government responses on the continent -- but it 's clearly overwhelmed by the realities of working in what is now a zone of military operations , @entity79 's north			0
as the insecurity in the region has spiraled , the worry is that more and more children are falling through the cracks			2
and as @entity35 increases its reliance on child suicide bombers , concerns are growing that orphaned children could end up in the hands of the terror group			2
at the camp where we finally met the man face to face , there was no attempt at subterfuge			1
we spoke in normal tones in full view of the children playing			2
i could have had one of them , i was told , but because i 'd specified a younger child , they 'd only identified one so far -- a 3 - year - old			0
did i want to consider an older girl ? a 12 - year - old maybe ? she could look after the 3 - year - old , and cook and clean			0
either way , two girls would be ready tomorrow , he said			2
i could see them then			0
our last phone conversation revolved around what an appropriate " donation " would be in exchange for the children			2
he could n't , he said , bargain for it			2
he then proceeded to do just that , laughing down the phone at my first tentative guess of $ 200			2
laughing again at $ 300			0
we finally found a figure he did n't find funny -- $ 500			1
i put the phone down and we traveled back to the capital that day to show @entity94 what we 'd found .			0

@entity3 team finds a man at " unofficial " displaced camp willing to provide children to be " fostered "
he says he ca n't take money for them , but eventually demands $ 500 for two girls
