@entity0 , @entity1 the question haunting @entity0 is this : who might be murdering allies of @entity1 's ousted president @entity6 ? the idea that this might be happening is not entirely new			1
but it muscled its way to the fore again this week with two high - profile shooting deaths in the @entity1 capital -- one of a former member of parliament with ties to @entity6 , the other of a @entity1 journalist known for his pro-russian views			1
@entity19 , the former member of parliament , was shot and killed shortly after 7 p.m. wednesday at the entrance to his apartment block			0
@entity19 , 52 , was a member of the @entity22 , the former ruling party in @entity1 , and was close to @entity6			1
police are investigating the death as a murder			0
a day later , on thursday , journalist @entity28 , 45 , was killed near his home by shots fired from a dark blue @entity31 , @entity27 adviser @entity26 said			0
the car 's license plates were reported to have been from either @entity34 or @entity35			2
the killings renewed speculation , sparked by earlier unusual deaths , about a conspiracy to kill people close to @entity6			1
at least three former members of parliament with the @entity22 have reportedly committed suicide in the last seven weeks : on february 28 , @entity44 reportedly jumped from the window of his 17th - floor apartment in @entity0 , having left a suicide note			0
he was suspected of having falsified the results of a parliamentary vote in early 2014 that essentially prohibited protest just as thousands of people were protesting against the @entity6 government			2
on march 9 , @entity53 , a former member of parliament with the @entity22 and the manager of several businesses in the separatist - minded eastern city of @entity58 , was found dead in his apartment near @entity0			0
he , too , reportedly left a suicide note			0
and three days later , on march 12 , @entity61 , another former member of parliament , was found in his house in @entity63 , in southeastern @entity1 , dead of a gunshot wound			1
police are investigating various scenarios , including suicide			0
@entity27 adviser @entity68 said @entity61 " might have wanted to avoid punishment for using violence against protesters , which he was suspected of			0
" @entity1 is deeply divided , and it has been for years			1
about a third of the population speaks @entity76 as opposed to @entity1			1
whether the country should be drawn into the orbit of @entity76 or the @entity79 is a visceral issue , a question for many @entity1 not of politics but of identity			2
recent events have deepened the divide			2
in 2014 , after @entity6 turned his back on the @entity88 in favor of closer ties with @entity76 , he was driven from office by mass demonstrations			0
and with @entity76 's subsequent annexation of @entity95 and its support for @entity76 - speaking separatists in eastern @entity1 , the internecine animosity made the ugly transformation into war			1
with a government toppled and armed conflict in the east , @entity1 have reason to want each other dead			1
but the view of who might be responsible for the series of deaths differs starkly , according to which side of the country 's divide one is on			1
the @entity113 , the country 's major opposition party , has no doubt the deaths have been politically motivated -- " bloody terror against opposition politicians and journalists , " the bloc 's media office called them			1
" it is clear oppression of those who are not afraid to criticize the government , " it said			2
the government , unsurprisingly , sees things differently			0
@entity1 president @entity128 , who came to office after @entity6 was ousted , has demanded an investigation of the killings of @entity19 and @entity28 , his media office said			1
" it is evident that these crimes have the same origin , " the media office quoted @entity128 as saying			0
" their nature and political sense are clear			0
it is a deliberate provocation that plays in favor of our enemies			0
it is aimed at destabilizing the internal political situation in @entity1 and discrediting the political choice of the @entity1 people			2
" and @entity145 , an adviser to the country 's interior minister , took the theory one step further			0
" it should not be excluded that the killings of @entity19 and @entity152 were planned and organized from @entity153 and are a part of a plan to destabilize @entity1 and further support @entity157 mood in @entity76 society , " @entity145 said .			1

five recent deaths heighten suspicions on both side of @entity1 's ethnic divide
@entity1 's president orders an investigation of the recent killings
the opposition calls the killings " oppression , " but the government says @entity153 may be to blame
