@entity2 @entity1 's bombs tore through their bodies : singeing flesh , shattering bones , shredding muscles and severing limbs			1
but on tuesday , jurors also began to hear about the holes his bombs left in the hearts of the survivors and the families of the dead			1
now that he has been found guilty on every count , the jury must decide whether @entity20 bomber @entity1 , 21 , should live or die for what he has done			1
this is the victim impact part of the case , and the testimony was heartbreaking			1
four young people are gone , and grief fills the spaces they once occupied			1
a father with a shock of white hair cried for the daughter he called " princess			1
" " @entity33 was the light of my life			1
she was extremely smart , hardworking , beautiful , every father 's dream			1
i miss her a lot , " said @entity38 , dabbing at his eyes as he described his daughter , a 29 - year - old restaurant manager who was killed in the first blast at the 2013 @entity20			1
she was the one who could round up the family and put on big celebrations , he said			1
" nobody fills that boot now			1
" others are expected to come and cry for @entity49 , " a jolly soul , " assistant u.s. attorney @entity47 said , quoting the slain @entity53 grad student 's father			1
more tears will be shed for @entity55 , who was 8 and looked just like his dad			1
and for @entity57 , who was remembered at his memorial service by these words : " @entity61 heart , big smiles , big service			1
" " @entity1 murdered each one of them in a way that they had time to feel pain , they had time to be scared and frightened , but they had no time to say good - bye , " @entity47 told the jury			1
" and that is the very essence of terror			1
" timeline of bombings , manhunt and aftermath to understand the toll @entity1 's bombs took , jurors must know the stories of his victims , the prosecutor said			1
" these young women , this young man and this little boy , all of them were loved and they loved in return , " @entity47 said			1
" before he murdered them in some of the cruelest ways imaginable , they were sons , they were daughters , they were grandchildren , they were brothers and they were sisters			1
" jurors saw photograph after photograph of smiling , happy people with arms around siblings at weddings and birthday parties and family gatherings			2
there was the photo of @entity38 as a little girl in a red tap - dancing outfit			2
and then came the one that made her father smile through his tears			2
she was a little older and wearing a baseball uniform			2
" she traded that in for a bat , " @entity38 said			2
" she was n't really a girly girl , but she loved to whitewater , camp , play baseball			2
she had a good arm on her			2
i was very proud of her			2
" by contrast , jurors also were left with an indelible image of @entity1 , taken when he was in a holding cell in the very courthouse where the trial is being held			1
it is dated july 10 , 2013 -- the day of his arraignment on charges he deliberately set off the deadly bombs at the @entity20			2
he glares into the camera defiantly , his middle finger raised in a profane salute			1
" this is @entity1 , unconcerned , unrepentant and unchanged , " @entity47 said			1
" without remorse , he remains untouched by the grief and the loss that he caused			2
" @entity1 saw the people he killed as " the enemy , " she said			1
as a result , two women and a man never reached the age of 30 , and a little boy never made it to the third grade			2
" he knew they were innocents			2
he even called them that , " @entity47 added , referring to the message @entity1 scrawled onto the sides of a boat where he hid from police after the bombings			1
" but it did n't stop him from murdering them			2
" the people who were maimed by @entity1 's bombs are also testifying during the sentencing phase of the trial as prosecutors try to show the impact on victims of the attacks			1
the stories they told on the witness stand were even more gripping and horrific than the stories told during the guilt phase of @entity1 's trial			1
when the first of the two bombs went off , @entity171 , a senior in high school , was standing near the woman she came to know was @entity176			2
" there was a complete , utter chilling silence and then chaos			2
chaos like i 'd never seen and never hope to see again , " she said			2
the force of the blast knocked her to the ground			2
when she looked around , she saw blood and muscle everywhere			2
her shin bone had snapped and was protruding			0
it was the most horrifying image i could imagine			0
just seeing that on my own body , " she said , and began to cry			0
" i remember looking around and it just seemed like there were bodies everywhere , blood everywhere			0
" were you bleeding ? she was asked			0
looking down at the blood i was just shocked that much blood could come out of someone , " she said			0
" i was terrified that i was going to die			0
i did not know that i could be that injured and survive			0
" she said she began to scream			0
her bone - chilling cries could be heard on a video played in court -- the most graphic of many graphic images the jury has been shown			1
doctors were able to save @entity213 's leg , but others were n't so lucky			1
@entity215 lost both legs , one below the knee and the other above the knee			0
an amputation above the knee is the most difficult injury to recover from , jurors have learned at this trial			1
@entity224 was at the finish line , waiting for her sister to cross			0
" and then our whole world just exploded , " she said			0
" i unfortunately remember every single detail			0
" she remembers being knocked to the ground , hearing nothing and then screams , and seeing blood everywhere			0
" it 's kind of hard to explain but i want to get it right for all of you to understand , " she told the jury			1
she said it was " a surreal , out - of - body experience			0
" she remembers thinking , " what was that ? " and wishing she could turn back time by five minutes			0
her husband bent over her and told her it was a terrorist attack			0
by then , she began to feel pain worse than anything she had imagined			0
she wondered if she would die			0
" it hurt too much			0
i just did n't care , " she said			0
" i remember thinking i was going to die , that no one could go through that much pain			0
i knew it was very bad and i was thinking , ' is this it ? am i going to die ? ' i remember thinking i wanted to die			0
the pain was too much			0
" and then , she said , " the mom in me " took over			0
she remembers telling herself : " ' hell no , i do n't want to die			0
i have too much living to do			0
do n't let this be the end			0
this ca n't be the end			0
' " she remembers feeling relief once she arrived at the hospital , even as she signed the form authorizing doctors to take both her legs			0
" can i get on with my life ? absolutely , " she said			0
but she can never forget she 's a double amputee			1
" there 's always a level of discomfort			1
right now i 'm not comfortable , " she said from the witness stand			0
" the bottoms of my limbs , there 's this constant numb burning sensation			1
the only way i can describe it is it 's like you have the worst athlete 's foot in my life			1
" sometimes , she feels a stabbing sensation where her toes and calves used to be			0
" you do n't realize until you 're a double amputee how many dips and hills and inclines there are , " she said			0
" @entity287 are very hard			0
" @entity289 life is literally an uphill battle			0
