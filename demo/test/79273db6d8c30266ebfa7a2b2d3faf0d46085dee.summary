in the hours after the funeral of @entity1 , a community center and apartment complex that local leaders expected to serve as a catalyst for the rebuilding of a long blighted @entity8 neighborhood went up in flames			1
the $ 16 million @entity11 was being built in a part of town where half the properties are vacant buildings or barren lots , where unemployment rates reach 25 % and poverty and despair is rampant			1
" disheartened and bewildered " was how the rev. @entity20 , pastor of @entity8 's @entity21 , described feeling tuesday as he surveyed the still - smoldering ruins of the centerpiece of a community rebuilding effort led by his church and a coalition of other congregations			1
" i see the hopelessness ... and the emotions of the people but i still see hope in @entity33 that we can rise from the ashes , " he said			0
this can not be the legacy of @entity8			1
" the project was to include about 60 senior citizen apartments and a community center			1
in the works for eight years , the center was to provide behavioral health counseling , support services for people and families with @entity47 and @entity48 , employment training , home and credit counseling , and ex-offender re-entry services , according to documents filed with the state of @entity55			2
the cause of the blaze was still under investigation			0
the brick building burned to the ground in the riots that followed monday 's funeral for @entity1 , who died mysteriously on april 19 , a week after @entity8 police arrested him			1
anger over @entity1 's death may have spurred monday 's violence -- including buildings and cars set ablaze by rioters , looting and clashes with the police -- but members of @entity8 's clergy said it was also spurred by lasting issues with young african - americans in the city			1
" we 've been trying to make a major difference , trying to transform the community only to discover that something as tragic as this would take place , " said the rev. @entity76 , pastor of @entity77 -- part of the @entity80 's @entity79			2
" we saw it coming , " he added			0
" @entity8 is a tinderbox			1
we have a lot of anger as a result of unemployment			0
we have a high rate of incarceration			0
" high concentrations of poverty , underfunded and failing schools , neglected public housing projects and a lack of employment opportunities have been among the social issues long simmering below @entity8 's crumbling row houses , according to the local church leaders			1
" i think the reason that they burned it is exactly the reason why we needed it , " @entity20 said of the community center			1
" we were seeking to restore people while we rebuilt properties			0
we wanted to effect change in the human community as well as rebuild properties with affordable housing			2
" the rev. @entity113 , pastor of @entity114 and member of the coalition , said parts of @entity8 have not recovered from the 1968 riots that followed the assassination of the rev. @entity120 those riots sped up the flight of city residents to the suburbs			1
unemployment soared with the disappearance of blue - collar jobs			2
the drug scourge in the 1980s tore the community apart further			2
" the message was that our young people are not valued , " @entity113 said			0
new prisons were built , @entity113 said			0
hundreds of millions of dollars were poured into the revitalization of the historic @entity135 , a renaissance that eluded communities such as @entity8			1
" when you look at that kind of despair , when you look at people who notice beauty in a city that they can not even access , it creates such an undercurrent of anger , frustration and hopelessness , that 's not going to be fixed quickly , " @entity113 said			0
@entity113 recalled driving along downtown 's @entity151 on tuesday , near the @entity135 , the streets teeming with @entity155 and state police officers			0
" when i left downtown and came into @entity8 , i see no @entity157 , no troopers , " he said			1
" it sends a message that it 's a priority to protect the areas of the city where a lot of the money has been poured , where the wealth is			0
what 's missed is , it 's really not smart or wise in the long term to try to isolate certain problems in certain neighborhoods			0
what may start off as one neighborhood 's problems soon become the city 's problem			0
" @entity20 said the senior housing complex and community center was to open in november or december			1
the partner churches are expected to complete other projects offering affordable housing and mixed - use developments in @entity8			1
the center is being built by @entity183 , a low - income housing developer			1
@entity185 , senior vice president of @entity183 , said : " we are fully committed to rebuilding			2
" on tuesday , @entity188 , a representative of @entity189 , one of the largest african - american church architecture firms in the nation , offered a free conceptual rendering and design consultation for the rebuilding , @entity9 affiliate @entity187 reported			2
@entity20 , @entity113 and other clergy members on monday night met with gang members in an attempt to stem the street violence			0
@entity113 said it was the first time such a gathering took place			0
@entity20 called it a breakthrough			0
" young people just needed somebody to sit and talk to them and hear them cry , " @entity20 said , looking out over the ruins of the community project			2
this is , i do n't know what else to do			0
if we can rebuild @entity216 , we can rebuild @entity8			1
" @entity9 's @entity217 and @entity218 contributed to this report .			0
