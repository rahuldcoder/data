sleek chassis , alluring paintwork and a need for speed , but these are no ordinary motors			1
when pedal hits metal , an eco-friendly process gets set in motion			1
powered by electricity and engineered for efficiency , car enthusiasts from across @entity10 are sparking home - grown concepts that have gotten experts revving			1
in @entity18 , a city in northern @entity19 , a team of students from the @entity17 are currently applying the final touches to the " @entity21			1
" the students used locally available materials to build the vehicle , and even included recycled electrical components in the engine			1
while it runs on gasoline , the engine maximizes fuel efficiency and produces fewer emissions than normal cars			1
" we are sure we have a great car , " says the project 's supervisor @entity32			1
" now we are focusing on making some final enhancements to hone the driving strategy -- this is just like @entity39			2
" their compact creation , which was built over five months , will travel to @entity42 in may to compete in the @entity44 leg of this year 's @entity45 -- the motoring competition rewards those who travel the longest distance using the least amount of fuel			1
but the team is also working towards a hybrid petro - electric motor , which they hope to unveil in 2016			2
at low speeds the vehicle will be powered by electricity alone , but at higher speeds both electric and petrol components will work together			2
between extremes , excess power generated by the engine recharges the batteries that power the electric motor			2
it 's the model that @entity64 uses in the @entity65			2
@entity67 - focused designs like these are increasingly needed on the continent , as some studies say 50 % of global emissions of organic carbon could come from @entity10 in 2030			2
at may 's @entity45 , @entity21 's team will be hoping to race past the sleek " @entity76 " creation from the @entity75			2
painted the colors of the @entity19 flag and powered by a solar battery , the car 's aerodynamic teardrop shape helps minimize drag			1
constructing earlier iterations of this vehicle was put under stress in 2013 when university teachers went on a six month strike , but the industrial action did n't stop the team from tinkering with the electric engine			0
" we 've used small tires to reduce the overall weight of the vehicle , " explains team manager @entity91			0
" we 've trained ourselves to just think about fuel efficiency and create the most efficient vehicle			0
" other eco-friendly engineers are less about sleek and more focused on comfort			1
@entity100 's @entity99 has produced a two - seater electric car called " @entity102 "			1
with a super-light fibreglass body and lithium ion battery , the car can go 50 miles on a single charge			1
the design project cost $ 35,000 , but the engineers made sure to include leather seats and a cd player			0
whilst working on the @entity112 , the team is also developing an 28 - seater electric bus which will run on a mixture of electric and solar power			0
innovative creations have also come from the @entity117 in @entity19			1
their " @entity121 " car -- named after local mini-buses -- is made from locally available materials			1
the brake pads , for example , are made from palm kernels			0
@entity127 - @entity126 also has some key features that will come in handy when slipping through the city 's streets			0
windscreen wipers start automatically when rain hits the sensors , gears can be changed with the touch of a button and owners use their finger rather than a key to unlock the doors			0
and when it gets dark , the driver just needs to clap their hands to turn on the interior lights			0
elsewhere , engineers are working on green vehicles for the whole family			0
one @entity149 inventor is building suvs with electric motors powered by rechargeable batteries			0
@entity153 , who also founded a church , dreams big in his five - seater creations which are hand built in @entity157 , except for the headlights and tires			0
while he says the product will be affordable , it remains to be seen just how much a handmade suv would cost			0
these innovations certainly are impressive concepts , but it 's unlikely electric vehicles will be filling roads on the continent any time soon -- it is unclear how economically viable it would be for governments and companies to build the right number of charging points , but the issue of power itself is even more pressing			0
" reliability when it comes to electricity supply is key , " says @entity179 sustainability consultant @entity178			1
" convincing consumers across @entity10 to invest in an electric vehicle whilst electricity shortages are such a major issue in so many communities is a challenge			0
" read this : @entity10 's 10 most prosperous countries more from @entity10 editor 's note : @entity193 covers the macro trends impacting the region and also focuses on the continent 's key industries and corporations			0
