@entity0 , @entity1 the flag is crude , handmade , but the message is clear -- allegiance to @entity7 in @entity1			1
and the timing -- with @entity11 withdrawing , the @entity9 fractured , young men disillusioned and angry -- could not be worse			1
a group of fighters in @entity1 agreed to be filmed by a @entity2 cameraman parading their @entity7 flags in a valley not far to the south of @entity0 , the @entity19 capital			1
they are the first images of their kind shot by western media inside @entity1			1
the rise of @entity7 is an issue that the @entity19 president , @entity26 , has termed a " terrible threat			1
" @entity11 officials @entity2 has spoken to have voiced their concern about the potential for an @entity7 presence			1
one @entity11 military officer said the militants currently have limited capability but are trying to recruit disillusioned @entity9 in several areas around the country 's east and south			1
" there has been some very small numbers of recruitment that has happened , " colonel @entity39 , told @entity2			1
" you have disaffected @entity9 who are losing politically and some of the younger , newer fighters are moving to that camp			1
it does n't mean it 's operationally better			0
we are concerned about it -- resources , weapons , capabilities			0
( but ) i do n't see an operational effect			0
" in the valley , the men display their weapons , and practice high kicks			0
they are a little breathless at altitude , a little clumsy			0
they are all masked , all in military - style uniforms			0
our cameraman described how locals seemed to keep their distance from them			0
it is often said that rivalry between the nascent @entity7 presence and the @entity9 , who remain the big guns in @entity1 , is fierce enough to mean the @entity7 fighters could be killed for brandishing the flag			1
but it is fatigue with the @entity9 that appears to have provided fertile ground for their rise			1
one of them told @entity2 : " we established contacts with @entity81 ( another acronym for the group ) through a friend who is in @entity85 ( in southern @entity1 )			1
" he called us , saying : ' the @entity81 people have come to @entity1 -- let 's join them			2
' then we joined them and pledged allegiance to them			0
" our cameraman was n't allowed to film the satellite phones they say they use to talk to @entity94 and @entity95			0
they said they were religious students and deny any former association with the @entity9			2
they said that at night they go into nearby villages to try and find yet more recruits			0
they watch a mixture of online propaganda , old and new , on their smartphones			0
the fighter went on to explain that they were currently talking to the @entity9 to determine whether they would work with or rival them			2
he added they are currently designating a new leader , after the supposed head of @entity7 in @entity1 , @entity115 , was reportedly killed in a drone strike earlier in the year			1
for months , the @entity19 government played down the threat of a looming @entity7 presence in @entity1 , yet during his recent trip to @entity121 , @entity26 struck a different tone			1
" we are the front line			0
the terrorists neither recognize boundaries nor require passports to spread their message of hate and discord			0
from the west , @entity137 is already sending advance guards to southern and western @entity1 to push our vulnerabilities , " he told @entity132 in late march , using the pejorative name used to describe the militants by many @entity7 opponents in the region			1
there is some evidence to suggest that @entity7 may already be operating in the country			2
a series of brutal attacks on civilian buses have baffled investigators in the past month			0
the first was in february , when 30 people from the @entity150 -- @entity151 -- were abducted from a bus near @entity153 in the south of the country			0
they have yet to return			0
another hit three buses traveling in @entity158 , central @entity1 , killing 13 civilians including women and children			2
suspicions have fallen on possible nascent @entity7 cells as the @entity9 have vehemently denied responsibility for the attacks			1
@entity166 , the police chief of @entity158 told @entity2 of the bus attack : " i ca n't hundred percent say that they were @entity81 , but their act was completely similar to what is is doing in @entity95 ( and ) @entity94			2
" solid info on @entity7 ' whereabouts in the country is hard to come by			2
@entity2 spoke to local officials from five regions -- some emphasized the growing threat of the terror group , while others played it down			1
@entity153 : mp @entity180 says : " people have seen foreigners from central @entity184 countries and @entity186 countries wearing black clothes and masks and having black flags in the districts of @entity19 and in parts of @entity192			0
" " those foreigners are rich , even carrying @entity11 dollars			2
they have weapons and vehicles			0
some of them have even brought their families			0
" @entity198 : mp @entity199 says : " according to some reports , black flags have been seen in @entity198 's @entity203 district -- and a former @entity9 local commander , @entity204 , is now claiming to be @entity7 ' representative in that district			1
" @entity207 : senator @entity208 says : " according to the reports i have received from local officials in @entity207 , a number of foreign fighters -- including women -- have been seen in the district of @entity215 , wearing mostly black clothes , and some [ with ] the @entity218 headscarf			0
they have good vehicles and they are rich [ enough ] to buy food or goods at local shops for twice the normal value			0
" " they are said to live in the mountainous areas of the @entity215 district in abandoned mud houses , and a month ago were rumored to be training in the area			0
i can not 100 % confirm they are @entity7 , however			2
" @entity158 : mp @entity232 says : " i do n't think @entity7 fighters from @entity95 and @entity94 have come here to @entity1 -- but hardcore @entity9 members who have understood that the @entity9 name is dying have changed the color of their flags from white to black in order to stay alive			1
i know that some black flags have been seen in @entity158 province , raised by @entity242 fighters			2
" @entity243 : deputy governor @entity244 says : " there are @entity242 fighters operating under the name of @entity7 in @entity240 at the moment who have changed their flag from white to black			1
there have been armed clashes between newly - converted @entity7 ( members ) and @entity9 fighters ... who should be in control of certain places			1
" @entity2 's @entity257 contributed to this report .			2

a group of fighters in @entity1 is filmed by a @entity2 cameraman parading @entity7 flags
@entity11 official : @entity7 militants have " no military capability " at present , but are trying to recruit disillusioned @entity9 in several areas
rivalry between @entity7 and the @entity9 in @entity1 is fierce enough to mean the @entity7 fighters could be killed for brandishing the flag
