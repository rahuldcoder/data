@entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 by the time you reach the outskirts of @entity2 's capital , even the roads are showing signs of the sheer magnitude of this earthquake -- and the enormity of the task awaiting a country struggling to come to terms with devastation and tragedy			1
the main highway that heads east out of @entity19 shows massive cracks , the tarmac torn apart by the force of saturday 's huge tremor			1
one lane is bisected by gaping , half - meter ( 1.5 feet ) fissures			1
they 've been filled in with rubble and dirt , allowing passage for those desperate citizens to reach their families in outlying districts			1
it takes an age , though , picking our way along damaged roads to a small village community , @entity0			1
it is only 30 kilometers ( 20 miles ) east of @entity19 but the journey takes almost two hours -- and the travel times likely to be compounded the farther out from the city people go			1
the community is off the main highway , down a dirt track that quickly finds itself winding through forested slopes and terraced fields			1
they farm corn here , and millet , and vegetables			1
compared to the capital , and the regions west of @entity19 and closer to the epicenter , the people here were relatively lucky			1
still , passing through villages it 's clear that damage has been suffered			1
in @entity0 a village official walks quickly by , telling us over his shoulder that 90 % of the houses are currently uninhabitable			1
some are still standing , but seem precarious and the residents are too scared of aftershocks to move back inside			1
patchy reports have filtered through of entire villages leveled by the quake or engulfed by landslides			1
@entity70 , 62 , is alive , but surveys the desolation the quake has wreaked on her life			2
we find her sitting as close as she can to the ruins of the house that she built with her late husband			1
she 's petite and frail but hardened by life			2
her leg , bandaged and suppurating , is stretched out in front of her			2
she periodically flicks at the flies that have settled on the blood - and pus - soaked dressing			2
" i just want to cry , all i feel is hurt " she says , showing us where she was the moment the earthquake struck			2
@entity70 's house was one of the bigger ones in this region , a rare two - story structure			2
she and her husband built it together , a lifetime ago			2
he died years ago , but her extended family lived here with her until saturday			2
she , along with her daughter - in - law were indoors when the quake struck , and she was lucky to make it out onto a small wooden balcony			2
another tremor brought this down and she had to extricate herself from the rubble and crawl up an embankment			2
the younger woman , trapped in the wreckage after the roof fell in on her , eventually clawed her way out			2
she was transported by motorbike -- few here have motorized transportation ; most walk -- to a missionary hospital in a neighboring village , 12 kilometers ( 7.4 miles ) away from here			1
now she is back , wondering what the next step for her is			0
throughout this region , there have been small landslides and people have been industrious in clearing rubble from the roads			1
there is little sign of aid having made it out here			1
out of necessity people are back working their fields			0
near the road a family makes lunch in the open as their house was destroyed			0
elsewhere in @entity0 , other unfortunate families count the cost of the disaster			1
@entity138 , 31 , lost his only daughter , @entity139 in the quake , who was killed as their house collapsed			0
she was 2 years old			0
he was working when the quake hit , tilling the fields like so many in @entity145 , and ran back to his house after quickly realizing the force of the tremor			0
" i started digging with my hands , " he says , still very much in shock , but remembering his frantic efforts among the remains of his damaged home			1
" and i saw her , blood was trickling from her mouth and she was covered in cuts			0
" all he has left now is a picture in his phone ; a chubby - faced toddler , wearing oversized sunglasses			0
as rain starts falling -- soon turning into torrents and further hampering recovery efforts -- we huddle with four families who have been displaced			0
they 're in a makeshift , ramshackle shelter , crowded with frightened people			0
i ask one of the young women , @entity172 , with me if she has seen any sign of outside help			0
" no , no government has any support for us			0
no one has come out to see that we 're living like this			0
" she said it was terrifying , and the future no less so			0
" our house is gone now			0
we do n't know where we sit , what we eat			0
we do n't have any clothes , all our clothes are inside			0
we ca n't go inside our houses			0
" there was a creeping sense that the worst was over , until another powerful aftershock overnight			0
" we are not safe ... we are so scared , " @entity172 tells me			0
and all this a mere 90 minutes drive from the capital			1
there are parts of @entity2 so remote it takes days to reach under normal circumstances -- there are villages here that one can only reach on foot and it is those areas that were hardest hit			0
these are the places where aid has yet to arrive , and where no one really knows the full extent of human loss or how many tragedies like the one at this home have unfolded			1
@entity210 reported from @entity211 in @entity2 and @entity212 wrote from @entity213			0

roads out of @entity19 are damaged but passable
even close to the capital , aid is taking forever to trickle through
east of the city , the village of @entity0 counts the cost of devastation
