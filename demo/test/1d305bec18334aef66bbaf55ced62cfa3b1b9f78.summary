have you ever found the creative inspiration you were seeking at the most unexpected time , or thought you were having that long - awaited problem - solving epiphany just as you nodded off to sleep ? according to neuroscientists @entity7 and @entity8 , there 's a reason for that			1
their book , " @entity13 " , explores the influences at work behind that much sought - after " @entity17 ! " moment			1
research suggests that in trying to conjure up inspiration , most of us end up suppressing it			1
the book explains how to clear out mental junk , in order to make way for pivotal revelations			1
dr. @entity7 explained : " insights involve unusual connections			1
cognitive psychologists call these ' remote associations '			1
they are processed mostly in the brain 's right hemisphere			1
insights occur when a subconscious remote association suddenly pops into awareness			1
this is accompanied by a burst of activity in the brain 's right temporal lobe			1
" " we wrote " @entity13 " to help people understand how creative insight works in the brain so they can use various strategies harmoniously without having them cross-circuit each other , " said @entity7			1
" for example , there is evidence that imagining the future helps to put someone in an insightful state			1
however , if a person imagines a specific future that makes them anxious , then insightfulness could decrease because anxiety is a creativity killer			1
" " that said , a positive mood and a broad , expansive spread of attention are a couple of key features of the insightful state , " he added			1
following are some of the tips they suggest for unleashing your creative potential -- both at home and at work			1
even high ceilings have been shown to broaden attention			1
small , windowless offices , low ceilings and narrow corridors will do little to inspire our brains and make us flexible , creative thinkers			1
relaxing outdoor colors such as blue and green contribute to this state			2
" emergency " colors such as red suppress it			2
surprisingly , dark colors and dim lighting can also be beneficial : by obscuring visual details , they help people think more abstractly			2
static surroundings encourage static thinking			2
you should sometimes change everyday routines , such as where you go for coffee or your route to work			2
rearrange your furniture and decor from time to time , at home and in your workplace			2
hold meetings in a variety of places			1
make sure to include some nonconformists in your inner circle			2
unusual people tend to be out - of - the - box thinkers , and their unique outlook might help you attack a problem from a different angle			2
the threat of a firm deadline will narrow your thinking and inhibit your insight			2
try and use soft target dates and a flexible schedule to establish a helpful , nonthreatening time frame			2
rewards and punishments for meeting or missing deadlines , if needed at all , should be vague and mild so they do n't contribute added pressure			0
a positive outlook will help stimulate a more open mind , one that can process a greater number of ideas			0
if you struggle to think happy , try focusing on the people and things that bring you joy			0
to put a twist on @entity135 's famous saying , chance favors the happy mind			1
when you 're stuck on a problem , take a break to do or think about something very different			0
expose yourself to a variety of people and places			1
listen to music or go to a pleasing movie , art exhibit or talk a walk			0
play a game , dance , do yoga , read			0
insight triggers appear at the most unlikely times and places			0
we all know how important sleep is to our cognitive thinking			0
the sleep - deprived mind is more likely to fixate on small matters -- an absolute killer to creativity			0
ample sleep also helps foster the discovery of hidden connections between ideas			0
@entity166 thought is at its best when your powers of inhibition are weaker , because reduced focus opens up your awareness to remote associations that would n't come to you when you 're feeling sharp			0
if you 're an early bird , you should try doing your creative work at night			0
if you 're a night owl , try the morning			0
perhaps the single most important thing to remember is that your mental state can change			0
it takes a while to sink into an insightful mindset			0
try and schedule uninterrupted blocks of time for relaxed , freewheeling creative thought			0
get rid of the clock			0
let abstract ideas and vague impressions flow where they will			0
tips have been extracted from the book " @entity13 " , which has been written by dr. @entity7 and dr. @entity8			0

two neuroscientists have conducted brain imaging to examine moments of *clarity*
sudden " insights " are otherwise known as " @entity17 " or " @entity17 " moments
we can *increase* our chance of these insights with a variety of daily changes
