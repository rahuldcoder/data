@entity0 has recalled its ambassador to @entity3 for consultations after two @entity0 were among eight drug smugglers executed by firing squad early wednesday			1

@entity7 did n't say what permanent actions , if any , would be taken against @entity3			1
" this is a dark moment in the relationship , but i 'm sure the relationship will be restored , " he said			2
one of the men 's @entity3 lawyers , @entity18 tweeted his apologies			1
i lost , " he said			2
" @entity3 president @entity22 appeared to shrug off the diplomatic recall , telling reporters that " our legal sovereignty must be respected			1
we also respect other countries ' legal sovereignty			2
" foreign minister @entity29 said the country had no plans to recall its own ambassador in response			2
" this is a legal case			2
this is not a political case so at this very stage , we do not have any plan to call our ambassador back from @entity41 , " he said			2
six other inmates were executed , including @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 ; @entity3 @entity47 and @entity49 @entity48 , who was said to be mentally ill. on wednesday , @entity49 's foreign ministry released a statement expressing " deep sadness " at @entity54 's execution , saying that @entity49 president @entity55 had urged her @entity3 counterpart to spare him due to his " psychiatric condition			1
" @entity54 is the second @entity49 to be executed in @entity3 this year , with the first -- @entity59 -- prompting the country to recall its ambassador for consultations			1
the @entity3 government had originally announced that nine prisoners would be executed , but at the last moment filipina @entity65 was spared			1
" we are so happy , so happy			2
i thought i had lost my daughter already but @entity69 is so good			0
thank you to everyone who helped us , " her mother @entity70 told @entity1			0
@entity75 embassy officials said @entity65 would be returned to @entity77 prison in @entity78 later on wednesday			1

@entity65 's lawyers claimed the mother - of - two was the victim of human trafficking			0
they say she was offered work in @entity96 , but when she arrived she was told the job had been filled and was n't aware the bag she 'd been given for the return journey to @entity3 was filled with drugs			1
a tenth prisoner , @entity103 @entity102 , was also scheduled to be executed but his case was delayed while a court considers a legal challenge			1
candlelight vigils were held for @entity10 and @entity11 in the hours ahead of the expected execution			0
the men 's legal teams had been fighting for years for a stay , but it was n't to be			0
the men -- then aged in their early twenties -- were arrested in 2005 as part of the " @entity116 , " a drug smuggling gang that intended to import 8 kilograms ( 17.6 pounds ) of heroin from @entity119 to @entity0			1
the pair were transported with other prisoners to @entity3 's so - called " execution island " in march , and after being given 72 - hours notice of their execution on saturday , @entity10 married his longtime girlfriend , @entity126 , on monday in prison			1
the executions of @entity11 and @entity10 came despite the fact that both this week received a court date of may 12 to hear an outstanding legal challenge			2
on tuesday , lawyers for the men also said @entity3 's @entity134 had yet to properly investigate claims of corruption during their original trial and sentencing			1

visiting hours were extended until 8 p.m. to give them extra time before they were asked to leave			0
under @entity3 law , the death penalty is carried out by a 12 - man firing squad , although only three guns are loaded with live ammunition			1
prisoners are given the choice of whether to stand or sit , and whether they want to wear a blindfold , hood or nothing			0
the shots -- aimed at the heart -- are fired from between 5 and 10 meters ( 16 to 33 feet ) , according to @entity163			0
after the executions , the rights group released a statement condemning them as " reprehensible " and issue fresh calls for a moratorium on the death penalty			1
while the @entity116 have garnered much international attention , their punishment is part of a larger government effort to combat illegal drug trafficking			0
@entity3 president @entity22 has insisted that @entity3 would not be swayed by appeals for clemency because the country is dealing with a " drugs crisis			1
" he told @entity1 in january that clemency would not be extended to drug traffickers , leading to an appeal from @entity10 and @entity184 that their cases had n't been properly considered			0
lawyers for the two men said they underwent radical rehabilitation during their 10 years in @entity189 and were helping to counsel and support other inmates			2
@entity10 was ordained as a @entity193 minister who led prayer meetings , while @entity11 became an accomplished painter and established his own art classes inside the @entity119 prison			0
