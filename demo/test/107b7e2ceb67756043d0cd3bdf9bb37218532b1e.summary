@entity0 when she was growing up , @entity3 , wanted to be a fashion model -- not an unusual aspiration for a young girl			1
but @entity3 suffers from a rare genetic condition that leaves the skin on her face and body red raw and open to infection			1
" i really do n't think i knew that i did n't look like everybody else , " she says			0
she was born with @entity14 ichthyosis , which means her skin is extremely thick , dry and flaky -- resembling fish scales			1
she ca n't sweat but she can shed tears			0
on the day we speak , her appearance raises few eyebrows at her local @entity21 in @entity22 -- she 's a familiar and well - known presence in the waterfront @entity0 town where she grew up			2
@entity3 's struggle to come to terms with her condition and other people 's reactions to it has , at times , left her on the brink of suicide			1
but , now 22 , she refuses to let it get in the way of her life -- she has a full - time job , plays sport and is embarking on a career as public speaker -- educating and inspiring others about the challenges of looking " visibly different			1
" after she was abandoned at birth , long - time @entity0 expats @entity44 and @entity45 began fostering @entity3 , when she was just one and a half years old			1
they were told she did n't have long to live			0
" we wanted to give her a family life in the time she had , " says @entity44			1
however , @entity3 began to thrive in a loving family environment and @entity44 and @entity45 formally adopted @entity3 when she was three years old			1
together they gradually learned how to manage her skin condition			1
each day she bathes twice , ideally for two hours each time , and everywhere she goes she carries a backpack with three or four tubs of cream that she must apply throughout the day to stop her skin from drying out			2
she 's thought to be the fourth oldest person alive with harlequin ichthyosis			2
but while @entity3 's unusual appearance made little difference during her early years , that changed when she started secondary school			1
the school she attended required that she be accompanied by a educational assistant , which put up a barrier between her and the other children and made it difficult for her to make friends			0
things got worse when she became a victim of cyberbullying			0
she began to deny her appearance , stopped bathing , taking her medication and applying the cream			0
at times , she considered jumping from the balcony of her home			0
" they 'd say things like ' you should n't have been born ' -- and very personal things that only people who knew me would know , " she says			0
" it made me very wary of everybody			0
even when people tried to be nice , i did n't repay it			0
i did n't trust them			0
" the worst episode lasted for 10 months and only stopped after police became involved and found the bully -- someone whom @entity3 thought was her friend			1
@entity3 left school with no qualifications			1
she says the school did n't push her to study and made too many allowances for her skin disorder			2
" i still wish i had got a very hard kick up the backside from the teachers when i was n't doing work , " says @entity3			1
since leaving school , @entity3 has found a full - time job working with people with special needs and at weekends can be found running around a rugby pitch with a whistle -- she 's a referee for kids ' matches			1
along with her parents , she 's also begun speaking about her experiences of living with a " visible difference " and cyberbullying at schools around @entity0			2
her father has also written a family memoir called " @entity118			0
" many have found her story inspirational -- a real life version of the young adult novel " wonder " by @entity124 about a young boy with a deformed face who enters middle school			2
on saturday , she will graduate from school assemblies and speak in front of a paying audience at a @entity133 talk in the city			0
her father is both protective and proud			0
he thinks public speaking will help @entity3 come to terms with her condition but he 's also wary that she could be portrayed as a " modern freak show			1
" " it 's difficult for her because she spent so long denying it			2
the more she confronts it , the more she is aware of it -- it will build confidence , " he says			0
there 's even talk she might take part in a fashion show for people with visible difference , realizing a childhood dream			2
in person , @entity3 comes across as articulate , poised and confident -- something her mom says comes out of spending so much time with adults while growing up -- and it 's easy to see how she could command an audience of hundreds			1
but after two hours of chatting in a coffee shop , she 's a little bored and keen to get back to her job			0
she flings her backpack over her shoulder and dashes off into @entity0 's crowded streets .			0
