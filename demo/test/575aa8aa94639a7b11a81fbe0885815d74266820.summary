it takes a village to raise a triathlete			1
since returning home from our kickoff weekend where we got to experience life as a full - time triathlete , i 've been juggling training life with a full - time job , hectic commute and time with friends and family			1
with my @entity18 teammates spread far and wide , this was a solo effort			1
throw in a notorious @entity20 winter that refused to go gently into that good night , and i 'll admit it : i was not very diligent in getting all of my training done			1
" partner up , " the @entity23 status read			1
@entity26 , the founder of my local women 's fitness groups , @entity25 , posted this mantra to help us keep ourselves accountable			1
and so that 's what i did			2
i 'm lucky to count a handful of both experienced and aspiring triathletes among my friends			1
so , i reached out to them to ask what they were up to			2
@entity39 , who 's training for her first @entity42 half - triathlon this summer , suggested a group brick workout at our local gym			1
she invited several other women , including complete newbies , through the @entity23 group and 10 of us met up on a cold @entity20 morning to swim for 15 minutes , bike for 30 minutes and run for 15 minutes			1
that was great motivation to keep up with my workouts for the next week			2
a few weeks later , i traveled to @entity53 , @entity54 , to run a marathon			2
i traveled to @entity53 with three phenomenal " fitspirations " : @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 -- who are members of an obstacle course race group called the @entity62			1
seeing how much fun they 've had participating in some really daunting physical challenges helped me push through some of the more difficult moments of running my first marathon ! swimming remains my weakest link			2
i just learned to swim last summer			2
sometimes i forget that and do n't cut myself any slack or recognize how far i 've come			0
once my formal swim class ended in february i found myself seriously slacking on my swim training			0
enter my swim angels , @entity76 and @entity77			0
they took me out into @entity79 last year after my first swim class was complete for a celebratory " swim " ( which was really just wading )			0
it was great to have them join me for a swim workout			0
i appreciated their perspective and gentle coaching			0
and you know what was happening while i was partnering up ? @entity90 was on the way ! and that meant i could finally break free of my @entity94 bike sessions and hit the road			0
i was lucky enough to connect with the @entity96 of @entity20 ( @entity97 ) for a series of novice rides they 've been hosting on local trails around @entity102			0
with two falls behind me ( hey , those clips take some getting used to ) , we got in nearly 23 miles and a new addiction was born			0
riding outside with the wind whipping your face , chasing your friends and breathing fresh air is exhilarating and i 'm looking forward to many more rides outdoors			1
i want to say thank you to the fellowship of fitness that i 've been lucky enough to find			0
there are so many others we keep me inspired , accountable and motivated			1
i 'm so grateful that they keep me moving in the right direction and i hope that i can help others do the same			0
so when times get tough , partner up !			0
