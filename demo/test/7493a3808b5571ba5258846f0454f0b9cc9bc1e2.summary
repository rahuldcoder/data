please , not even a demonstration			2
@entity3 's family had asked there be quiet on @entity6 's streets the day they laid him to rest			1
and above all , no violence			1
raging hordes turned a deaf ear to that on monday			2
but a handful of people repeated the family 's message			1
they became criers in the desert against countless young people flinging rocks at police , breaking windows , looting and setting fires			1
the peacemakers -- clergy , @entity3 's family and brave residents -- placed themselves in the rioters ' way			1
their message was the same			2
" i want them all to go back home , " said rev. @entity32			2
" it 's disrespect to the family			1
the family was very clear -- we 've been saying it all along -- today there was absolutely no protest , no demonstration , " he said			1
but the messengers were a finger in a dam that quickly crumbled , as rowdy groups swelled into a full urban riot			2
it overshadowed the message peaceful protesters delivered on prior days -- justice for @entity3			1
the 25 - year - old @entity54 - @entity53 man died from spinal injuries after being arrested earlier this month			0
the early fits of violence came in the afternoon , about the time mourners left @entity3 's memorial services blocks away , rev. @entity32 said			1
they bumped right into it			0
" for us to come out of the burial and walk into this is absolutely inexcusable , " he said			0
he did not want to see it spread to downtown @entity6 , where some rioters said it would , and organized people to stand in the way			1
" we have a line of gentlemen from the @entity72 to build a human wall , as well as men from the @entity75 making that human wall , " he said			0
but as crowds turned into multitudes , the intervention became a drop in the bucket by compare , and police lines were also no match			1
as officers in riot gear receded , flames engulfed cars and stores and roared out of apartment buildings into the night sky			0
a senior living facility under construction by a baptist church burned to the ground			0
the blazes stretched the fire departments ' resources , as at least 30 trucks deployed			0
looters streamed into a @entity100 , bodegas and liquor stores and walked out with what they could carry			0
a young man in a blue sweatshirt tried to talk people down by himself			0
he walked up to @entity1 correspondent @entity107 , as a store nearby was being looted			0
it later went up in flames			0
the man , who did n't say his name , was disgusted at what was happening in his neighborhood and disappointed in the police response to rioting			1
there was a line of police down the street , not far away			1
" they could have moved down here to stop it , " he told @entity107			0
the @entity3 family 's lawyers , again , put the family 's wish out to the public that there be no protests that day , let alone violence			1
it 's marring the cause and hope for change that may have come out of the investigation into @entity3 's death , said family attorney @entity139			1
" that 's just disintegrated into just looking at @entity6 and thinking that the city is the city of violence , " she said			1
against all odds , a handful of individuals kept trying to stop it			0
a tall , adult man walked up to a young man who was confronting riot police			1
he slung an arm over his shoulder , turned him back around in the other direction and marched him away from police lines			1
but as they strolled past a crowd , a young man behind them hurled a stone at police , putting his whole body into the throw			2
at least one young man paid the price for his participation , when his mother turned up to spank him home			0
before running cameras , she slapped him in the head again and again , driving him away from the crowd , as she cursed			0
police commissioner @entity170 later thanked her			2
" i wish i had more parents that took charge of their kids out there tonight , " he said			0
after night fell , giving way to a 10 p.m. curfew for juveniles , @entity176 stood alone with his back to a line of police in riot gear			2
he shooed away young people tempted to approach them			0
" go ! step your -- ss away ! " " i 'm just a soldier , " said @entity176			0
he told @entity1 's @entity188 that he was a veteran of the @entity189			2
young people had no business on the streets , he said			0
" they need to be in their home units studying and doing something with their lives			0
" even @entity6 members of the @entity199 and @entity200 , two street gangs renowned for drug dealing and extensive violent crime -- and for killing each other -- came together with others who condemned the rage that swept through their neighborhoods			2
" the guys who pulled me aside are self - identifying as @entity199 and say they do n't approve of whats happening			0
' this is our community , ' " wrote @entity211 reporter @entity210 on his confirmed @entity213 account			2
gangs members joined community leaders and @entity3 's family for a press conference monday night on the stage at @entity221 , which had held @entity3 's funeral			1
an announcer thanked them for coming to the church			0
the gangs have signed a peace deal and are uniting to push against police lines in protests , according to a report by the @entity230			1
rev. @entity32 also mentioned their peace treaty			0
but police say the gangs ' purpose goes much further -- that they and another gang called the @entity239 plan to ' take out ' law enforcement officers , police said			2
" this is a credible threat			0
" the gangs are consistently pursued by the @entity243			0
at the end of the day , @entity3 's family had the last word on the violence at the press conference			1
" to see that it turned into all this violence and destruction , i am appalled , " said @entity250 , @entity3 's stepfather			1
" i want y'all to get justice for my son , but do n't do it like this here , " said @entity3 's mother @entity254 , who wore a t - shirt with her son 's photo			1
" i do n't think that 's for @entity3 , " his twin sister @entity263 said			1
" i think the violence is wrong			2
" after their comments , @entity3 family lawyer @entity266 took the microphone			1
violence is not the path to change , he said			2
then he got back to the message than had been bitterly marred by the rioting			0
@entity266 asked for a show of hands in the church audience of people who had experienced police brutality or personally knew someone who did			1
all but a few hands went up .			0

@entity3 's family asked there be no protests ; they condemned violence
community leaders and brave residents got in between rioters and police
