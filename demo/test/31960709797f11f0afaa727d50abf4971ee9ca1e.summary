it lays claim to being the most isolated human settlement on earth , a volcanic archipelago in the @entity6 , home to just under 270 people			1
now , the tiny settlement of @entity9 is seeking the help of architects and designers the world over to secure its future well into the 21st century			1
with the help of the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) , the @entity16 overseas territory is holding an international competition to improve aging infrastructure and make the island self - sustainable as it approaches the 200th anniversary of its settlement			1
as a sign of just how removed @entity9 is from the rest of the world , there are only seven family names on the islands			1
those who live there are mainly the descendants of @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity36 sailors as well as 19th century @entity16 explorers			2
there are also a handful of expatriate brits			2
but watching hit tv series " lost " or reading up on @entity44 's " @entity43 " wo n't be required research for competition entrants			1
instead , those with experience of renewable energy in remote regions , modern housing and developing cost - effective agrarian systems are encouraged to apply			2
" the competition is looking at enhancing the built environment on the island ( and ) making all structures more energy efficient , " the island 's administrator , @entity53 told @entity1 when visiting the @entity16 recently			1
@entity53 explained that most existing homes and public buildings on @entity9 are small , bungalow - type structures made from made from a mix of concrete and local volcanic rock			1
few have simple insulation that can lead to energy savings while the infrastructure for things like renewable power generation and internet provision remain limited			2
the island is also only accessible by sea 60 - days - a - year through a small port in its only town , @entity76 of the @entity77			2
according to @entity79 of @entity80 , contestants will have to factor in irregular design questions such as " how can we get the material ashore and how can we actually think of ways that we can put things together once there ? " " there are limitations on the amount of cargo that can be trans - shipped , " he added			2
in total , @entity9 is made up of four islands			1
@entity9 is the largest land mass and the only one to house people			1
two more unpopulated islands , @entity96 and @entity97 , lie close by			2
a third , @entity99 , is situated roughly 230 miles away			0
both @entity99 and @entity97 are @entity100			0
the closest mainland port is @entity102 , @entity103 , some seven days sailing time and 1,750 miles north - east			0
@entity9 already has a pub , shop , cafe , dance hall , museum , catholic church and swimming pool			1
there are also two expatriate doctors , two @entity9 nurses and school teachers with some 30 students of varying ages			1
the island 's main industry is lobster fishing , with exports reaching as far afield as the @entity34 , @entity122 , @entity123 and the @entity124 thanks to a fishing company that has exclusive rights to fish in the surrounding waters			0
@entity9 earns additional income from the sale of unique stamps , coins and handicraft souvenirs , @entity53 explained			1
modest revenue also flows from tourism and visitor accommodation			0
" as it is the remotest inhabited island in the world , the @entity9 are already very self sufficient , being able to produce many of their own foodstuffs ( like fish , livestock and potatoes ) , " @entity53 said			1
however , the cost of living has increased in recent years , he added			0
with limited transport and communication links , the islanders are also keen to see how they can reduce their reliance on fossil fuels , improve the energy efficiency of properties and reduce imports			0
" we are slowly updating 40 - year old infrastructure , " @entity53 said of the last time the island experienced a major redesign			0
that modernization happened roughly a decade after the island was evacuated temporarily due to ongoing volcanic activity			0
before that period , the main way for the islanders to communicate with the outside world was by @entity162			0
things have already changed a lot since then , however			0
" a new water system , electrical system and waste water system have just been completed , " @entity53 said			0
" and with the 200th anniversary of the founding of @entity9 ( 2016 ) almost upon us it is an appropriate time to look at new initiatives that may be able to help the future viability of the community			1
" interested architects have until mid-june to submit their initial ideas			1
the best will be whittled down to an initial 20 and then five after further analysis between june and september			0
@entity79 and @entity53 say the islanders will have to apply to the @entity16 and possibly the @entity124 for grants to fund the project			0
the winner is penciled in to be announced in june 2016			0
the most important aspect for applicants is to " identify cost - effective and practical solutions to improve the energy efficiency ( through renewable energy sources ) of properties , " @entity53 said " as well as modernizing ... government structures			0
