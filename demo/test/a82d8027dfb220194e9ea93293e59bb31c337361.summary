@entity1 , @entity2 it did n't look like much , but we 'd been told it was typical of the kind of craft ferrying the route between @entity9 and @entity1			1
better , everyone advised , to be low key , even if low key meant faded lights and three water pumps chugging at all times			1
the wooden vessel was called @entity17 â€” after the holy city			1
we were told we 'd be at the port in @entity1 by the next morning , but as the hours ticked by it soon became apparent that that was wildly optimistic			1
@entity22 came and we were still only halfway there			1
we 'd been given a secure route , charted for us by the @entity25			2
it meant hugging the coastline , trying to stay as much as possible out of the deeper water in the middle of the @entity30 where the world 's navies seemed to be squaring off			1
it was almost double the distance of the direct route			2
add to that a strong current -- and stomach - churning seas -- and it felt like we would spend an eternity on board			2
after our second sunset , we were finally close enough for my phone to ping with a @entity2 welcome message			1
however , we could n't risk arriving at night ; even getting too close to shore would risk being mistaken for a re-supply vessel and potentially taking a @entity47 hit			2
the captain slowed the boat to a crawl so the remaining miles would stretch until daybreak			1
it was time to go into town to see what life was like for the people of @entity1			1
we were n't really sure what to expect but we did know we could n't stay for long			2
from the moment we stepped through the gates of the port , we were met by noise and desperation , shoving and shouting			2
" where are you going ? " " i 'll pay , i 'll pay " " are you here to take the @entity65 ? " i shouted back that we 'd return soon			2
we had just five hours on the ground and we needed to visit the hospital , the shuttered markets , the frontlines			2
there was so much we needed to see			2
the crowds clustered around our camera lens , asking " why ? " " why is this happening ? " " why has n't it stopped ? " it felt like no time had passed before we were told we had to go			0
we 'd been hearing pops of sniper fire all day but now we could hear rounds of automatic weapons and they were getting louder			0
as we arrived back at port , we found we were n't leaving alone			0
after waiting at port , praying a passing ship would dock , ours had become an unexpected lifeline for some of the families caught in the fighting			1
the @entity90 asked if we could take 60 refugees			1
it did n't feel like the answer could be anything but yes			0
what we did n't realize until it was too late was that the refugees were being charged $ 300 a person : an " exit fee			1
" those who did n't have the money were pushed back behind the wrought iron gates of the port			0
those that did shared our day - and - a - half trip home			0
as the shores of @entity9 grew closer , you could see the uncertainty begin to take over			0
many of them had come from comfortable lives , before the war shattered them			0
they had left homes that once hummed with air conditioners and televisions			0
would the camps have @entity120 , they asked			0
no , they would n't , i said			0
what i did n't say was that they 'd be lucky to have electricity			0
but woven amid the uncertainty was the relief of escape			0
some of the refugees took over our ship 's galley -- the kitchen			1
they 'd found a former chef amongst their number who commandeered the store cupboard , sending out a pick and mix of heaped trays			0
we got tuna spaghetti and more @entity145 coffee than our cameraman @entity146 could possibly drink			0
because we 'd brought refugees back with us , we were asked by the @entity148 to dock in the country 's north , in @entity151 , so they could be given the proper status while they wait to see what happens back home			1
the immigration officials were -- understandably -- a little bemused by our presence amongst a boatload of people fleeing @entity2 , but to their credit they decided the important thing was that these families were now safe			1
from there @entity162 was just a few hours away , hours that stretched into infinity for the families ringing my phone to check that their loved ones had made it into harbor			0
over the last few hours , people had shyly come up to ask if they could borrow our phone to tell their families they were safe			0
now a deluge of anxious parents , siblings and partners flooded my ear , asking how it could possibly be that we were n't yet on dry land			0
but eventually we were , and as we watched the @entity183 officials unload what remained of people 's belongings onto shore , it was a reminder that these were the lucky ones			1
thousands more are still waiting back in @entity2 , hoping they too will reach a safe port .			1
