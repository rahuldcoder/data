@entity1 driver and @entity4 championship leader @entity3 stole pole position for sunday 's @entity6 from teammate and fierce rival @entity8 in dramatic fashion			1
@entity3 took first place on the front row on the last lap , beating @entity8 by a slim four hundredths of a second margin			1
frenemies the two former friends have enjoyed , or rather endured , a heated rivalry since falling out last season and @entity8 's annoyance at @entity3 's last ditch success was obvious			1
the @entity21 appeared upset as he left his car and refused to shake @entity3 's hand			1
he did , however , find time to congratulate fellow @entity21 driver @entity26 , who will start in third after the @entity29 driver surprisingly won the @entity31 gp two weeks ago			2
" i do n't actually mind him having more ( poles ) , " a nonplussed @entity3 told @entity32 after the session			1
" he can have the trophy for most poles			0
as long as i have the trophy for winning -- that 's all that matters			0
ultimately qualifying is not the end of the world			0
" " i am frustrated " in the post qualifying press conference @entity8 appeared more magnanimous , but still shocked by @entity3 's last minute burst of speed			1
" i was frustrated , i am frustrated , yeah , " @entity8 admitted			2
" it 's so close and of course i would have wanted to have pole today ... it 's just four hundredths and that makes it even more annoying because it 's just very , very close			2
a lap is never 100 per cent perfect and four hundredths is really the blink of an eye			0
" @entity56 will join his teammate @entity26 on the second row and will be looking for a repeat of @entity29 's performance in @entity31 , which shocked @entity1 and @entity3 in particular			1
huge support but @entity3 has been quickest all weekend and will enjoy a surprising amount of support in @entity62 , a track the @entity65 driver has always thrived on			2
" have you seen the banners that i have here ? " he told the assembled press when asked why he liked racing at @entity62 so much			0
" the support i have here 's pretty unreal			0
i just like the track			0
i guess it just naturally suits my driving style			0

@entity3 will start on pole in @entity75
pushed teammate @entity8 into second on the last lap
@entity8 refused to shake @entity3 's hand afterward
