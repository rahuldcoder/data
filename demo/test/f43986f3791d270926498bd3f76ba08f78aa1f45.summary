most companies in @entity1 have hoesik at least once a month and sometimes every week			1
literally , this means dinner with co-workers			2
in practice , it means official eating / drinking fests involving multiple rounds of alcohol at multiple venues			1
for the foreign business traveler , using foreignness as an excuse to bow out of the action only goes so far			2
the pressure to participate is intense			2
drinking etiquette is the first thing you teach foreign guests , " says @entity17 , a @entity1 - @entity18 director at the @entity1 branch of a @entity18 company			1
" it was shocking when i first arrived in @entity1			1
" my boss was a graduate of @entity27 [ renowned for its hardy drinking culture ] and at my first hoesik , we started out with everyone filling a beer glass with soju , and downing it on the spot			1
that was just the beginning			2
" for @entity39 , drinking is considered a way to get to know what someone is really like			1
" i did n't really like it in the beginning , " says @entity43 , a @entity44 who came to @entity46 to work for a @entity1 company			1
" i was like , ' why are you making me drink something when i do n't want to ? ' but once i understood the meaning behind it , i appreciated it more			2
" there are just some things you ca n't say at work or talk about over lunch -- people who talk about work at lunch are losers			2
but when someone offers you a glass of soju , it 's an invitation that means that they want to listen to you			2
" i thought @entity39 were impersonal before i drank with them , so the whole context is important			2
" drinking is such a big part of @entity1 life that @entity46 traffic is said to correspond with the city 's drinking culture			1
mondays are a big night for hoesik , so there are fewer cars during evening rush hour , as most office workers leave them at work so they can go drinking			1
tuesdays are a rest day , while wednesday and thursday nights are also big nights for company drinking			1
fridays have the worst evening traffic , as everyone is taking their cars home to use with their families over the weekend			2
so how do you avoid offending someone ( worst of all , a superior or client ) at a @entity1 drinking extravaganza ? follow these seven handy rules			1
@entity39 always identify the " higher " person in the relationship , and defer to them accordingly			2
one of the first things @entity39 often ask when meeting someone new is their age			0
even someone just a year older is afforded a language of respect , though age is always superseded by a higher position			0
it 's considered rude for anyone to have an empty glass			0
if a senior person is pouring -- this usually pertains to hard liquor only -- others should n't drink until someone has poured the senior a shot			0
after all glasses are full , everyone says " @entity122 ! " and chugs -- usually " one - shotting " the entire glass in one go			0
while downing alcohol , you should turn your body away from senior figures so that your body visually blocks your drinking action from your senior			1
always hold bottles or shot glasses with both hands			0
by raising your glass or pouring alcohol with one hand , you are establishing yourself as a senior person			0
if you 're not , well , you 've just breached protocol			0
it 's always a good idea to find out people 's drinking habits beforehand			1
it should n't be difficult to find out what people like to drink or how they behave when intoxicated			0
@entity147 usually involves changing venues for a different type of alcohol -- i.e. , round one is dinner , accompanied by beer , round two is soju , round three is for whiskey , and so on			1
unless you have an airtight reason , refusing alcohol is considered a mood killer and deemed rude			0
sorry , but " i do n't like soju " does n't qualify as a good reason not to punish your liver			0
neither would " i 've been on the wagon for three years			0
" in fact , unless you 're pregnant or already puking , what might be a " good reason " not to imbibe elsewhere often wo n't fly here			0
it 's generally best to accept and discreetly get rid of unwanted alcohol ( under the table , into your water cup , out the window ) than to refuse it			0
one of the most popular venues in @entity1 for business drinking is the karaoke bar			1
@entity39 love singing , as evidenced by the country 's staggering number of karaoke bars , as well as the rush of audition programs on @entity1 television			1
your companions wo n't rest until you sing			0
they 'll coax , threaten , push and cajole until you finally take that mic			0
be prepared to crack under the immense peer pressure			0
if you simply can not take any more , you can call a black knight ( male ) or a black rose ( female ) to your rescue			0
this entails a person of your choosing drinking your glass for you , but it also means they get a wish			1
as in , you might soon wish you 'd just taken that last shot as you 're spelling your name out with your butt in front of your client			0
