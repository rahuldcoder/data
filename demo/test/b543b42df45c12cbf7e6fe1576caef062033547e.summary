it 's only june , but 2015 may be remembered as the year the term " transgender " fully entered mainstream consciousness			2
in january , president @entity5 condemned the persecution of " people who are lesbian , gay , bisexual or transgender , " becoming the first president to utter the word in a @entity13 address			1
" @entity16 , " about an aging father who begins living as a woman , won two top awards at the @entity15 , while transgender actress @entity25 of " @entity19 " -- who made the cover of @entity22 last year -- was just cast in a new @entity24 drama			1
the may issue of @entity27 has a photo spread with transgender model @entity29 , who said on @entity30 this week that she " was told by various people many times over that the chances of me ending up on these pages were slim to none			1
" a transgender character had a recurring storyline on the just - wrapped final season of " @entity40 , " while transgender activist and @entity43 star @entity42 will star in a reality show debuting on @entity45 this summer			2
and then there 's @entity47 , whose physical appearance has become more feminine in recent months as the @entity50 hero turned reality tv star underwent a very public gender transition			1
@entity53 ended months of speculation in an interview that aired april 24 on " @entity56 " with @entity57			0
" are you a woman ? " @entity57 asked			0
" yes , " @entity53 replied			0
now comes the new issue of @entity61 , with @entity53 on the cover in makeup and a skimpy dress , along with a new name : @entity66			1
it 's more obvious than ever that transgender people , long relegated to society 's shadows , are finally stepping into the light			1
" we are at a social inflection point on transgender issues , " says @entity72 , a former transgender activist and author of three books on queer theory , who believes all the attention could have a positive impact			2
" civil rights for minorities come in fits and starts			0
we 're on an upswing now			0
" opinion : why we need to listen to @entity47 's story transgender is an umbrella term for people whose gender identity -- their internal , personal sense of being a man or a woman -- differs from what 's typically associated with their sex at birth			1
some transgender people alter their bodies through hormones and or surgery , although many do n't			1
a 2011 study estimated that 700,000 @entity106 adults , or roughly 0.3 % of the population , identified themselves as transgender			1
for decades , trans people , as many transgender people like to be called , rarely saw themselves represented in popular culture			1
but recent years have brought the " @entity114 " contestant @entity115 ; filmmaker @entity112 , formerly known as @entity112 , a co-director of " @entity113 " ; @entity124 's @entity123 - winning role in " @entity125 " ; and of course , " @entity19 is the @entity116 , " whose cast is a mix of ethnicities and sexualities			2
now , between " transparent " and other shows , recognition from @entity5 and tabloid headlines about @entity53 , the national conversation around gender identity appears to have reached a new level			2
all this makes transgender advocates cautiously optimistic			2
@entity136 , deputy chief of staff at the @entity137 and a transgender man , remains hopeful that the growing number of transgender faces beaming weekly into @entity106 's living rooms can only have a positive effect			1
" i believe that the more people who know transgender people , the more they will understand , accept and support us , " @entity136 says			1
" that happens only if they acknowledge our humanity , and not treat us like tabloid fodder			0
" the transgender life : what to know , say and understand still , activists agree there 's a long way to go before transgender people stop facing discrimination or worse			1
for relatives and friends who are used to seeing someone as male or female , gender changes can be hard to accept			0
transgender people have long been misunderstood and persecuted -- as recently as 2012 , the @entity162 classified them as having a mental " disorder			1
" a recent report by the @entity137 found that transgender people in the @entity106 are more likely to face discrimination from employers and the effects of unemployment and poverty			1
many also are denied services from safety - net providers such as emergency shelters			0
a poll last year found that 59 % of @entity106 believe transgender students should use the bathroom of their birth gender			1
in december , attorney general @entity178 announced that transgender people will receive federal protection from discrimination under @entity181			1
but violence against trans people -- especially transgender women of color -- remains a national plague			2
according to recent statistics from the @entity137 , at least 13 transgender women were slain last year in the @entity106 and at least seven have already been killed this year			1
of those 20 victims , all but one were black or @entity192			0
" we are definitely in a critical moment for the trans movement			0
over the last year we have ... seen an increase in visibility that was unimaginable even just a few years ago , " said @entity195 , executive director of the @entity196			2
" at the same time it is clear that visibility is not enough			0
" in one case that made national headlines , a transgender @entity202 teen committed suicide in late december after her parents refused to acknowledge her wish to live as a girl			0
" transgender people are still subject to profound discrimination and violence , " said @entity72			1
" @entity212 acceptance is really needed , and long overdue			0
" when your young daughter says ' i 'm a boy ' so what impact will @entity47 's story have on all this ? gender - rights activists are reluctant to speculate			2
some fear the media firestorm around @entity53 , fueled by ties to the camera - loving @entity224 clan , trivializes what is a wrenching personal journey for many people			0
" you want to wish @entity47 the best			2
but at the same time , you wish it was n't being played out for reality - tv entertainment , " said @entity72 , the gender - rights advocate			0
" yes , it 's great that we 're educating people			0
but we 're talking about a civil rights issue that keeps getting recast as entertainment			0
" as a much - hyped tv event , the @entity53 interview gave millions of viewers their first exposure to gender - identity questions and put a sympathetic human face on an issue that remains perplexing to many people			0
but it could also trigger a backlash , some say			0
@entity248 , associate professor of sociology and anthropology at @entity251 in @entity252 , @entity253 , fears @entity53 could provoke those who already are averse to gay or transgender people			1
such people " tend to use these moments to frighten the general public , relying on fears about trans women in bathrooms or locker rooms , " said @entity256 , author of numerous books about queer politics and culture			0
" usually these moments tap into pre-existing panics about gender or sexuality , not necessarily spawning new ones			0

@entity50 hero @entity47 appears on @entity61 cover as " @entity66 "
transgender people in the @entity106 are riding an *unprecedented* wave of visibility
shows such as " @entity16 , " " @entity19 " have raised awareness
