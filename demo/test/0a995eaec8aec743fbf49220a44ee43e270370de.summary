@entity0 says its @entity2 crashed into @entity3 on thursday after running out of fuel , ending a nearly 11 - year journey that provided valuable data and thousands of photos			1
mission controllers at the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) in @entity10 , @entity11 , confirmed the probe slammed into the surface of @entity3 , as anticipated , at 3:26 p.m. edt , @entity0 told @entity1 in an email			1
@entity0 earlier said the probe was expected to hit the surface at 8,750 miles per hour and to create an impact crater 52 feet ( 16 meters ) in diameter			1
the crash was n't visible from @entity20 because it occurred on the far side of @entity3			0
messenger ( an acronym for @entity24 ) was launched in 2004 and traveled more than 6Â½ years before it started circling @entity3 on march 18 , 2011			2
it was the first spacecraft to orbit the planet closest to the sun. it traveled about 5 billion miles -- a journey that included 15 trips around the sun. spacecraft to make death dive into @entity3 the spacecraft was healthy when it crashed , but was out of fuel			2
when scientists determined there was no way to save it , they held a briefing this month to celebrate the mission 's success			0
" for the first time in history we now have real knowledge about the planet @entity3 that shows it to be a fascinating world as part of our diverse solar system , " said @entity42 , associate administrator for the @entity43 at @entity44 in @entity45			0
one of the mission 's big findings : it sent back data indicating that ice in @entity3 's shadowed polar regions , if spread over an area the size of @entity45 , would be more than two miles thick , @entity0 said			1
as the end neared , the probe sent back some final tweets thanking mission managers and counting down its final orbits			0
the messenger mission is over , but scientists say they 'll be busy for years studying data from the probe			0
and while the space probe wo n't be sending back anymore images , you can see @entity3 with your own eyes			1
it 's visible in the night sky just before dusk until about the end of may .			0
