the bizarre circumstances surrounding @entity2 's death have inflamed tensions across the country			1
how could a man suffer a severe spinal cord injury after getting arrested ? and what happened in the 30 minutes before he was taken to a hospital ? @entity2 wavered in and out of a coma and died sunday , one week after his arrest			1
it 's not clear how he suffered the spinal cord injury			1
but @entity2 is far from the only suspect who died under questionable circumstances after he was already in custody			2
here are several other cases : date of arrest : march 31 , 2015 date of death : march 31 , 2015 what happened : police in @entity22 , @entity23 , responded to a call of a disorderly person , and @entity26 was arrested and handcuffed			1
police dispatch recordings include an officer saying @entity26 " tried to grab my gun			2
" one witness , @entity30 , told the @entity31 that @entity26 was resisting arrest			0
but two others told @entity34 that police attacked @entity26 while he was already handcuffed			1
" they punched him , stomped him , kicked him and then they let the dog out of the car , " @entity36 told the station			0
" the dog bit him on his face and around his body			0
there 's no call for that			2
once a man is handcuffed and unconscious , you should have stuck him in the patrol car and take him to the police station			1
" witness @entity51 gave a similar account			0
" the other cop let the dog out , and they just kept punching him and the dog kept biting him at the same time , " @entity51 told @entity34			0
" he was on the floor , like he was knocked out			0
" as @entity26 was taken to a hospital , he became unresponsive , @entity58 reported			0
he was pronounced dead at the hospital			0
the aftermath : the @entity62 @entity61 has been investigating @entity26 's death , and officials have been waiting for the results of @entity26 's autopsy to learn the exact cause of death , @entity58 said			2
two @entity22 officers have been placed on administrative leave			0
and after @entity22 police received criticism on its @entity76 page about @entity26 's case , the department started hiding unfavorable comments , the @entity71 reported			1

he was told only that they were black , " and one of the males mentioned having a gun , " the report said			2
@entity26 consented to a pat - down , and @entity113 found marijuana in his pocket			0
attorney @entity126 said that detail makes the official narrative even more suspicious			0
" if you pat someone down and you can feel a small package of marijuana , would n't you feel a gun ? " he said			2
state police said once @entity26 arrived at the police station , he refused to get out of the patrol car			2
" as the deputy requested assistance from other deputies , @entity26 produced a handgun and fired one round , striking himself in the back , " state police said			2
@entity26 was pronounced dead at a local hospital			0
the aftermath : an autopsy concluded @entity26 's death was a suicide -- but said he was shot in the chest , not in the back , like police had said			1
the autopsy report also said @entity26 was " reportedly in a locked patrol car with his hands handcuffed behind him when officers heard a shot and found the decedent slumped over			1

video of the incident showed @entity177 , who was schizophrenic , slow to cooperate			1
@entity168 police officer @entity178 then tells him : " you see my fists ? they 're getting ready to f --- you up			1
" @entity177 , who is unarmed and shirtless , stands and another officer walks over			1

" you can talk , so you can breathe			0
" he did n't breathe for much longer			1
@entity229 was so weak that officers had to carry him to a station 's holding cell for booking and left him face - down on the floor , the @entity228 reported			0
by the time paramedics arrived , @entity229 's heart had stopped			0
the aftermath : a coroner concluded that asthma probably killed @entity223 and that his death was an accident			0
