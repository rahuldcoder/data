it has all the key points you 'd expect on a birth certificate -- baby 's weight , length and date of birth confirmed with an official insignia			2
the difference here is the governing authority 's stamp : the @entity13 in @entity14 and @entity15			0
it 's one of many official documents relating to matters such as vaccination schedules , fishing methods and rent disputes in the areas now controlled by @entity23			1
for @entity23 sees itself as a government operating under a rule of law , even if the group is most often talked about for its barbaric punishment of anyone who resists or defies its medieval interpretation of that @entity31 law			1
the @entity23 documents , some shared with @entity0 by researcher @entity34 , give a window into the bureaucracy of the self - declared caliphate			1
last summer , @entity23 fighters swept through the @entity14 city of @entity40			1
once they took power , leaders wanted to show they could bring stability allowing daily life to resume			1
so , they quickly reopened the @entity45 , albeit under a radically altered curriculum			0
notices went out that classes would resume on 24 @entity49 1435 in the @entity31 calendar ( or october 18 , 2014 , in the @entity52 calendar ) , about four months after @entity23 overran the city			1
but some subjects would be banned -- democracy and political thought , also hotel management and tourism and archaeology			0
families flee @entity23 in @entity14 " the banning of archaeology is not a surprise , " says @entity34 , who is a @entity61 at the @entity62 at the @entity63 , in @entity64			1
" we see that reflected in @entity23 destruction of ancient artifacts			1
@entity23 regards pre-islamic artifacts as relics from the ' period of ignorance ' , jahiliyah			1
their main concern with archaeology is that it would become a subject turning to idol worship , which is strictly forbidden in @entity31			0
" hotel management and tourism may seem strange as first			0
but there are no hotels under @entity23			1
they have all been taken over and shut down , either rented out or become places to house families			0
" @entity45 still has the same professors and teachers , @entity34 says			0
" but now teachers are subjected to @entity89 sessions , to learn what is and what is not acceptable to @entity23			1
so , they have preserved the prior system but within @entity23 sharia law conditions			1
" the @entity94 runs hospitals for anyone feeling ill , not just wounded fighters			0
it has maternity wards , health clinics , even a mobile vaccination unit			0
and while an ancient interpretation of religion remains at the heart of rules , there is more nuance than was seen in @entity108 and areas still controlled by the @entity110			2
" this is one thing that distinguishes @entity23 from groups like the @entity110 , which forbids vaccinations			1
polio is a problem in @entity117 because the @entity110 believes the vaccines are a forbidden substance			0
but @entity23 is not that primitive , " says @entity34			1
" this is also reflected in education : the @entity110 , forbids all girls ' education			0
but @entity23 allows girls to go to school , albeit in a segregated environment			1
" however , education for girls is limited to the age of 15			0
reporting from areas controlled by @entity23 is near impossible but anecdotes of daily life and death do emerge			1
@entity34 's conclusions on @entity23 's governing principles and methods follow similar findings by the @entity137 , other researchers and social activists			1
how @entity23 makes ( and takes ) money it is an @entity31 principle to care for the environment , so that 's one reason that using explosives to catch fish is banned			2
and a quote from the @entity147 saying property owners should lessen the burden on renters to earn spiritual rewards is used at the start of a document outlining a policy on rent control			0
" a general theme for @entity23 is that they try , initially when they seize control , to portray themselves as more just , more fair to the inhabitants than the previous ruler , " explains @entity34			2
" for example , in @entity15 , the first thing @entity23 did was lower the price of bread			2
this is as much about winning over the population as it is about religious rulings			0
" at times , such as taking up the case of renters , the regime can seem almost benevolent , @entity34 says			0
" if someone does complain , especially in @entity15 , @entity23 does actually try to deal with it , " he says			2
" that 's why they 've been seen by many in @entity15 as imposing order , especially in areas where multiple parties , rebel factions and the @entity15 government were previously in control			0
" @entity23 control of its territory is absolute -- bus schedules show routes from @entity188 to @entity40 and @entity189 with no acknowledgment of the @entity15 - @entity14 border , just the new provinces created by the group for its territory			1
detained @entity23 members speak from @entity14 jail and inside that territory , even entertainment is regulated			2
foosball can be played , provided there is no gambling and the faces or heads are taken off the figurines to prevent idol worship			0
a fatwa on entertainment goes on to say that chess , billiards and other " contemporary games " do not benefit @entity210 but may be played if they do not distract from religious obligations			0
it reaches that conclusion from the @entity147 and other religious teachings			0
that 's also part of @entity23 strategy , says @entity34			2
" one of @entity23 's goals is to present this very religiously learned image , showcasing their knowledge of @entity31 jurisprudence to justify to their following that they are the moral authority			2
it 's clear that @entity23 and their religious clerics and scholars are extremely familiar with religious texts and use them to convince and persuade @entity23 followers , which also makes them impervious to any religion - based counterargument			2

@entity23 is known for *brutal* *takeovers* and medieval justice , but it sees itself as a state
official documents show just how far their rules affect daily life
