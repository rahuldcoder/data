on the stage of a tv studio in @entity3 , @entity5 @entity4 is telling an engrossed audience a tragic , but familiar , story			1
on april 17 , 1975 -- 40 years ago today -- life as @entity4 knew it was shattered when her hometown , the @entity13 capital of @entity3 , fell to the genocidal @entity15 regime of the @entity16			1
@entity4 , then 13 , was separated from her mother and two of her sisters who , along with virtually the entire population of @entity3 -- about two million people -- were sent on a forced march into the countryside to work			1
@entity4 never saw them again , nor learned what happened to them			0
but about 20,000 people died from execution , starvation or exhaustion during this exodus at gunpoint , according to war crimes prosecutors ; the others were subjected to slave labor in rural camps once they reached their destination , where many met similar fates			2
the urban evacuation marked the first phase in the @entity15 's revolutionary program of social engineering , intended to establish a new order -- free of money , family ties , religion , education , property and foreign influence			1
aimed at creating an agrarian utopia , it would instead prove one of the worst genocides of the modern era , resulting in the deaths of at least 1.7 million @entity13 -- about a quarter of the country 's population -- over the next four years			1
@entity4 remained in the capital with her father and four other siblings , three of whom would succumb to starvation and disease in the following years , before her father was shot to death before her eyes in 1979			1
his killing prompted @entity4 to leave her sole remaining family member , youngest sister @entity70 , in the care of a local couple			0
she set out on her own , making her way to a refugee camp and eventually to the @entity75			0
for more than 30 years she has wondered what happened to her baby sister			2
" i think she was the only family member to survive , " she says , with tears in her eyes			0
as she finishes her story , the producers usher a woman on the stage			0
@entity4 embraces her sister and both women sob			0
" i missed you so much , " @entity4 says			0
" i 've always searched for you , " @entity70 tells her			0
since production began five years ago , the television show , " it 's not a dream , " has reunited members of 54 @entity13 families shattered by the genocide			1
more than 1,500 have sought its help			0
the series is just one example of the ways in which @entity13 's traumatized society is beginning to undertake the fraught , painful business of reckoning with their history			1
" the scars of the @entity15 are very deep and physical and present in modern @entity13 , " said @entity103 , a human rights lawyer whose parents were killed by the regime , and who moved to the @entity75 as a refugee before returning to her homeland as an adult			1
she described the country as a " land of orphans			2
" for decades after the @entity15 were driven from @entity3 by @entity119 - backed @entity118 forces in january 1979 , the regime 's crimes were seldom spoken about , let alone attempts made to seek redress for victims			1
in large part , this was because people remained scared , say experts			2
far from being snuffed out by the @entity118 invasion , the @entity15 existed for another two decades			1
after fleeing the capital in 1979 , @entity15 leader @entity128 and his supporters established a stronghold in the west			1
they continued as an insurgent guerrilla force and became part of a government - in - exile that , until 1990 , was recognized by the @entity137 as the country 's only legitimate representative			2
" in many villages , people have been living side by side with the executioners for decades , " said @entity140 , executive director of the @entity141			1
@entity147 , a @entity13 expert at the @entity148 at @entity149 , said that " for many years , there was a virtual taboo on even speaking of the @entity15 , as if the very words were ... a malevolent spirit lurking in the corner of every room			1
" the silence was also due to the fact that @entity13 , in @entity103 's words , " lacked the vocabulary " of therapy and healing to process a crime of the magnitude of the one perpetrated against their society			1
the @entity15 's attempts to reboot society at " @entity168 " had involved a concentrated effort to exterminate the country 's educated classes -- doctors , lawyers , accountants , engineers , merchants and clergy			1
" nearly two generations of young @entity13 men grew up learning little more than how to kill , " said @entity147			1
" when it was finally time to rebuild , there were effectively no bootstraps with which the country could pull itself up again			2
" even today , said @entity184 , young @entity13 are not taught about the genocide in high school			1
in an impoverished country -- one of @entity190 's poorest , albeit with 7 % predicted economic growth this year -- most young people seemed to be focused on getting ahead than looking back , she said			1
some were even skeptical that the @entity15 's crimes -- the systematic butchery of the " killing fields " -- had really occurred , she added			1
the space for discussing , redressing and healing from the genocide only began to open up in the past decade with the establishment of the @entity201 , said @entity103			2
founded in 2006 , the @entity201 in the @entity202 ( @entity201 ) is a " hybrid " tribunal using both @entity13 and international judges and staff to investigate the @entity15 's crimes against humanity and bring leading regime figures to justice			1
intended as a southeast @entity190 equivalent of the @entity211 , the tribunal , which has cost $ 232 million so far , initially enjoyed broad support			2
" we had great hope for this process , " said @entity103			0
" the presence of the international community raised the comfort level of the population to speak about the @entity15 crimes			2
" but the pace of proceedings has seemed glacial , given the advancing years of the suspected war criminals , two of whom have died while facing trial			2
another was ruled mentally unfit to stand trial			0
( the @entity15 's top leader , @entity128 , died in 1998 , having never faced charges			2
) this , coupled with persistent accusations of political interference from the @entity13 government , has soured attitudes towards the court			2
@entity237 , who once appeared as a civil party in proceedings , today regards it as a " sham			2
" for many victims , it is " too little , too late			2
" opinion : an ongoing struggle for justice after the @entity15 in the first case heard , @entity248 , also known as comrade duch -- commandant of the notorious @entity250 where more than 14,000 people were killed -- received a life sentence for war crimes , crimes against humanity , murder and torture			1
the court 's only other verdicts , delivered in august last year , sentenced @entity261 , the regime 's " brother number two , " and @entity262 , " brother @entity265 , " to life			0
both men have appealed their convictions			0
in a separate case , the pair are on trial on additional charges of crimes against humanity and genocide			0
evidence is expected to continue being heard into 2016 , @entity201 spokesman @entity276 said			0
two further , and highly controversial cases , known as 003 and 004 , are also currently under investigation			0
three people were charged last month in relation to those cases : former @entity15 navy commander @entity283 ; @entity284 , a former district commander accused of leading a labor camp ; and @entity287 , a former deputy accused of overseeing massacres at detention centers			1
two other suspects are being investigated			0
@entity292 said no further cases would be pursued after 003 and 004			0
prime minister @entity294 , @entity13 's strongman leader for decades , has long been a vocal opponent of 003 and 004 , claiming that pursuing the cases could push the country towards civil war			1
@entity294 himself is a former @entity15 battalion commander , who defected to the @entity118 side ; his perceived political interference is viewed by critics like @entity237 as an attempt to shield political allies from the tribunal			2
others are more forgiving of the tribunal 's shortcomings			0
@entity147 , a former investigator for the tribunal , has described it as an " imperfect vessel " for delivering justice , but says @entity13 's leaders must strike a balance between two imperatives : delivering justice for victims , and completing the reintegration of former @entity15 into society			1
he said the most important aspects of the tribunal 's work are those that take place outside the courtroom -- triggering changes in @entity13 society			2
" in that respect , the proceedings ... may be shaping up to be more successful than anyone could have hoped , " he added			0
undoubtedly , @entity13 today have overcome the fear of talking about the genocide -- to the extent that even the perpetrators feel emboldened to say their piece			1
@entity140 said the country has seen a wave of @entity15 memoirs , written by former cadres wanting to argue their case before they die			1
" there 's a lot of people who want to tell the world they 've been fooled by a grand idea of a revolution which went bad , " she said			0
@entity262 , " brother @entity265 , " published one such effort ahead of his trial , while @entity348 , a @entity349 - educated former diplomat for the @entity15 regime , published his " journey of a @entity353 " in @entity351 in 2013			1
he told an interviewer from @entity351 's @entity355 last year that he believed that @entity15 dictator @entity128 's prescriptions for @entity13 were sound			1
" i remain convinced that the @entity358 analysis made by @entity128 of the socioeconomic situation of @entity13 , a poor and sparsely populated country , was correct , " he said			1
for survivors , these self - serving justifications for crimes gone unpunished must be hard to take			0
but for a few of them , at least , @entity13 's opening up about the genocide has finally brought about the prospect of some healing , however bittersweet			1
on the stage of the " it 's not a dream " studio , as @entity4 hugs her long - lost sister , footage of an even older woman is projected on a screen			0
" do you know the person in the video ? " the show 's host asks			0
" yes , " @entity4 says			0
" she is my mother			0
" moments later , @entity383 , 77 , is brought up on stage			0
" where have you two been ? " @entity383 asks			0
" i always worried about you two			0
" " i thought you died , " @entity4 says			0
the three women cry and embrace			0
" it is very miserable for all of us , " the old woman says .			0

@entity3 , the @entity13 capital , fell to the genocidal @entity15 40 years ago today
at least 1.7 million people were killed in the *subsequent* four years , before the regime was driven out
decades on , the country is still struggling to gain justice for victims and heal from the genocide
