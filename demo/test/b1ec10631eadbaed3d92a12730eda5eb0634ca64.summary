@entity1 , @entity2 freshly laundered clothes still hang friday in the dormitory at @entity5			1
stuffed animals remain in one room			1
on the wall in another hangs a poster on proper preparation for @entity12 prayer			1
these small reminders of college life at this @entity2 school belie the horror of what happened here : the slaughter of at least 147 people , many of them students who lived in this building			1
on friday afternoon , more than 36 hours after the attack , investigators and @entity2 @entity26 crews were finishing up the task of removing the bodies of dead students			1
the corpses of four @entity32 attackers -- dressed head to toe in black and still clutching their ak - 47s -- remained where they fell , their bodies shattered in a torrent of bullets			1
@entity2 terrorist attack : 6 things you need to know investigators marked the locations of students ' bodies with numbered tags before @entity26 workers came in to send them off to morgues			1
they would call out to each other with the locations of the dead , reducing once promising lives , for the time being at least , to numbers			1
sometimes , the cell phones of the dead would ring , taking the workers aback			1
beyond the bodies , evidence of what had happened at the dormitory was everywhere			1
shattered glass and shell casings littered the floor			1
walls and ceilings were marred by bullet holes			1
in some places , the blood was as thick as mud			1
the problems plaguing @entity2 's security efforts according to students and authorities , militants burst onto the campus around 5 a.m. thursday			1
the gunmen , from the @entity32 terror group , first stormed a @entity80 prayer service , killing some students , taking others hostage			2
they rampaged across the campus , shooting non-muslims , sparing @entity85 , a witness said			2
one student , @entity87 , told @entity3 she hid inside a wardrobe for nearly an hour before the gunmen came for her			2
come out , they told her , you wo n't be shot			2
" they were lying , " she said			2
the gunmen herded her and maybe three dozen other students into a community room where they 'd usually hang out and watch television			2
they were told to lie down , lectured about how the @entity95 forbids killing women			2
and then the men , @entity98 said , were shot in the head			2
one of the gunmen egged on the others			0
" shoot them ! shoot them ! " he would say , according to @entity98			0
more lecturing : the land , the gunmen said , did n't belong to nonbelievers			0
we , the gunmen said , have just two missions : to kill , and be killed			0
and then they started shooting the women			0
" anyone who is breathing , shoot them , " @entity98 said the gunman in charge said			0
" we just lay there hopelessly , because we know automatically we 're going to be killed , " @entity98 said			0
it was then she saw the blood of a fellow student coursing toward her on the floor			1
she smeared it onto her face and body to make it appear she , too , was dead			0
" in the time of shooting , they skipped me , " she said			0
she survived with only a hand wound			0
