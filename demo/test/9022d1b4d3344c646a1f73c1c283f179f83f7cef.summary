like phone booths and typewriters , record stores are a vanishing breed -- another victim of the digital age			1
@entity12 has largely abandoned brick - and - mortar music retailing to a scattering of independent stores , many of them in scruffy urban neighborhoods			1
and that 's not necessarily a bad thing			0
yes , it 's harder in the @entity23 era to find a place to go buy physical music			2
but many of the remaining record stores are succeeding -- even thriving -- by catering to a passionate core of customers and collectors			2
on saturday , hundreds of music retailers will hold events to commemorate @entity33 , an annual celebration of , well , your neighborhood record store			1
many stores will host live performances , drawings , book signings , special sales of rare or autographed vinyl and other happenings			1
some will even serve beer			0
to their diehard customers , these places are more than mere stores : they are cultural institutions that celebrate music history ( the entire @entity52 oeuvre , all in one place ! ) , display artifacts ( @entity55 on vinyl ! ) , and nurture the local music scene ( hey , here 's a cd by your brother 's metal band ! )			1
they also employ knowledgeable clerks who will be happy to debate the relative merits of " @entity66 " and " @entity67			0
" or maybe , like @entity68 in " @entity69 , " just mock your lousy taste in music			0
so if you 're a music geek , drop by			0
but you might think twice before asking if they stock " @entity73			0

saturday is @entity33 , celebrated at music stores around the world
many stores will host live performances , drawings and special sales of rare vinyl
