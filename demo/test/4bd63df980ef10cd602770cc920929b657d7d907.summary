a fiery sunset greeted people in @entity3 sunday			2
the deep reddish color caught @entity7 native @entity6 's eye			2
he photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city 's skyline and shared them on @entity13			0
the stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of @entity18			1
" the dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had @entity7 locals wondering where the amber - colored haze was originating from , " @entity19 said			0
the fires were started in southeastern @entity18 , by farmers burning grass in their fields			1
but on april 14 , it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region , according to @entity1 affiliate @entity33			0
as a result , the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region			0
rescue crews were able to put out the flames			0
however , the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds			1
the winds carried the smoke from @entity18 across the @entity45 and brought it to the @entity46			1
parts of @entity48 , @entity3 and @entity49 are seeing the results of the smoke , wind and solar light combination			0
the reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens , blues , yellows and purples , @entity33 said			1
that means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered			0
the colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person 's eye			2
as the smoke starts to dissipate , air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue .			1

smoke from *massive* fires in @entity18 created fiery sunsets in the @entity46
atmospheric winds carried smoke from the wildfires across the @entity45
smoke particles *altered* wavelengths from the sun , creating a more intense color
