one summer a few years ago , @entity0 worked as an intern in the @entity4 offices of @entity1			1
@entity0 -- the daughter of @entity6 singer - guitarist @entity5 and an executive producer of the new @entity9 documentary on his life , " @entity5 : @entity6 " -- was " a 15 - year - old @entity12 kid , so stoked , " she recalls with a laugh during a recent interview for the cover story in our new issue			1
she remembers providing research assistance on a cover about the @entity20 -- and working in a cubicle across from a wall with a giant painting of @entity5			1
" yeah , " @entity0 says with a grin and mock - exasperation , " looking at my dad every day			1
" ( preview the cover story and listen to a previously unheard @entity5 song here			1
) that is one of many stories and revelations that come out over almost three hours late one afternoon in early march , as @entity0 , now 22 and a visual artist , speaks publicly for the first time about her father ; life after his death ; her complex relationship with her mother , @entity37 ; and the new film , written , directed and produced by @entity39			1
" @entity5 got to the point where he eventually had to sacrifice every bit of who he was to his art , because the world demanded it of him , " @entity0 says bluntly at one point			1
" i think that was one of the main triggers as to why he felt he did n't want to be here and everyone would be happier without him			2
" @entity1 : listen to a previously unheard @entity5 song but " in reality , if he had lived , " she goes on , " i would have had a dad			1
and that would have been an incredible experience			2
" what follows are additional excerpts from a remarkable -- and moving -- conversation			2
how would you describe " @entity6 " ? it 's emotional journalism			1
it 's the closest thing to having @entity5 tell his own story in his own words -- by his own aesthetic , his own perception of the world			1
it paints a portrait of a man attempting to cope with being a human			2
when @entity39 and i first met , i was very specific about what i wanted to see , how i wanted @entity5 to be represented			1
i told him , " i do n't want the mythology of @entity5 or the romanticism			1
" even though @entity5 died in the most horrific way possible , there is this mythology and romanticism that surrounds him , because he 's 27 forever			1
the shelf life of an artist or musician is n't particularly long			2
@entity5 has gotten to icon status because he will never age			1
he will always be that relevant in that time and always be beautiful			2
@entity1 : 17 young innovators shaking up the @entity87 there is , with any great artist , a little manic - ness and insanity			1
" @entity94 " is one of my favorite books			2
and [ author ] @entity95 had this work ethic , where he would get out of bed every day and force himself to write five pages			2
it taught me that if you do the work , you progress			2
so many people are content to settle			2
my dad was exceptionally ambitious			2
but he had a lot thrown on him , exceeding his ambition			2
he wanted his band to be successful			2
but he did n't want to be the f --- --- voice of a generation			2
do you remember the first time you heard a @entity6 record -- and knowing that was your father ? i 've talked to @entity115 about this			1
he had a few more years with his dad that you did			2
but for him , the records were a road into understanding his father after he was gone			1
i do n't really like @entity6 that much [ grins ]			1
sorry , promotional people , @entity123			2
i 'm more into @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 [ laughs ]			2
the grunge scene is not what i 'm interested in			2
but " @entity133 " [ on @entity133 ] is a f --- --- great song			0
and " dumb " [ on @entity134 ] -- i cry every time i hear that song			0
it 's a stripped - down version of @entity5 's perception of himself -- of himself on drugs , off drugs , feeling inadequate to be titled the voice of a generation			1
@entity1 : @entity143 , @entity144 defend transgender prisoners ' rights the irony is that he wrote it before @entity6 made nevermind			1
it was projection , to something			0
there 's no way anyone can wrap their minds around that			0
did you feel awkward as a teenager , not being that interested in the music @entity5 made ? no. i would have felt more awkward if i 'd been a fan			1
i was around 15 when i realized he was inescapable			0
even if i was in a car and had the radio on , there 's my dad			0
he 's larger than life , and our culture is obsessed with dead musicians			0
we love to put them on a pedestal			0
if @entity5 had just been another guy who abandoned his family in the most awful way possible			1
he inspired people to put him on a pedestal , to become @entity175			0
he became even bigger after he died than he was when he was alive			0
you do n't think it could have gotten any bigger			0
after the first screening i attended , there was a guy who said " @entity6 " was a very interesting film about people he did n't like			1
[ @entity186 ] that 's a pretty good description			0
@entity1 : a guide to @entity5 's cinematic legacy i found it interesting that the way @entity39 told @entity5 's story did n't evoke any sympathy for that viewer -- that @entity5 's art did not resonate with him			1
all he saw was a personalty he did n't like			0
that is an interesting perspective			0
for me , the film provided a lot more factual information about my father -- not just tall tales that were misconstrued , misremembered , rehashed , retold 10 different ways			1
it was factual evidence of who my father was as a child , as a teenager , as a man , as a husband , as an artist			1
it explored every single aspect of who he was as a human being			0
what was it like hearing his voice ? i 've been hearing his voice forever , through his music			0
i was thinking more of his speaking voice			0
his speaking voice is sort of similar to mine			0
it 's sort of a monotone			0
the depth to it is similar to the way i speak			0
i do n't know what the f --- that is			0
i was n't even talking when he was around			0
do n't mistake the power of genes			0
it 's very weird how genes are			0
@entity241 [ @entity242 ] , @entity238 [ @entity239 ] and @entity240 came over to a house where i was living			0
it was the first time [ the @entity246 members ] had been together in a long time			0
and they had what i call the " @entity248 , " which is when they see me , they see @entity5			1
they look at me , and you can see they 're looking at a ghost			0
they were all getting the @entity257 hardcore			0
@entity241 said , " she is so much like @entity5			1
" they were all talking amongst themselves , rehashing old stories i 'd heard a million times			0
i was sitting in a chair , chain - smoking , looking down like this [ affects total boredom ]			1
and they went , " you are doing exactly what your father would have done			1
" but i was glad they came over [ smiles ]			0
it was a cool experience , like having a @entity6 reunion minus one			1
what do you want to do next , now that this film is coming out ? in being one of the executive producers , you 're stepping into the public at almost the same age your father was when he made @entity6 's first album			1
i like to think of it as poetic			0
oddly enough , being 22 , it 's the first year a fire has been lit under my ass -- not because of the documentary , just personally			1
i have this motivation and ambition that i did n't have before : " i want to go paint this painting			0
" the hardest part of doing anything creatively is just getting up and doing			0
once i get out of bed and get into my art room , i start painting			0
and i 'm doing it			0
