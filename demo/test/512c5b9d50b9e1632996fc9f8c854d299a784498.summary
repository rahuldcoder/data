one year after it was perpetrated , the kidnapping of nearly 300 schoolgirls by a jihadist group in @entity3 remains a crime almost too horrifying to comprehend : hundreds of teenaged girls , just finishing school , destined perhaps for significant achievement -- kidnapped , never to be seen again			1
" this crime has rightly caused outrage both in @entity3 and across the world , " the country 's president - elect , @entity9 , said tuesday in marking the anniversary			1
" today is a time to reflect on the pain and suffering of the victims , their friends and families			1
our thoughts and prayers , and that of the whole @entity3 nation , are with you today			1
" the girls were abducted on the night of april 14 - 15 , 2014 , in the town of @entity27 , in northeastern @entity3 , about a two - hour drive from the border with @entity30			1
the @entity31 had been closed for a month because of the danger posed by @entity34 militants , who are opposed to @entity36 education , particularly for girls			1
but students from several schools had been called in to take a final exam in physics			2
the militants stormed the school , arriving in a convoy of trucks and buses and engaging in a gun battle with school security guards			0
then they forced the girls from their dormitories , loaded them into trucks and drove them into the forest			1
most have never been seen since , except in a photograph in which they sat on the ground in a semi-circle , clad in @entity56 dress			0
they were between 16 and 18 years old			0
police said the militants kidnapped 276 girls in all			2
about 50 managed to escape soon after they were abducted			0
those who did not , it is feared , may have been raped , brutalized , enslaved and forced to convert to @entity56			0
their parents were stricken with grief			0
on @entity69 , a hashtag began trending and spread around the world : # @entity71			2
on tuesday , @entity72 , the 17 - year - old @entity73 girl who was shot in the face for speaking out in favor of girls ' education , sent a message to the kidnapped girls			1
" i am one of the millions of people around the world who keep you and your families foremost in our thoughts and prayers , " she wrote			1
" we can not imagine the full extent of the horrors you have endured			0
but please know this : we will never forget you			0
" one year later , a few things have changed			0
each of the missing girls has had a birthday in captivity			2
each is now a year older			0
@entity3 's current president , @entity99 , was defeated in his campaign for re-election , in part , it is thought , because he failed to effectively combat @entity34			1
@entity9 , the incoming president , has pledged an aggressive effort to wipe out the group			2
but much remains unchanged , as well			0
@entity34 still controls swathes of northeastern @entity3			1
according to @entity107 , 800,000 children have been forced to flee their homes because of the conflict between the @entity3 military , civilian self - defense groups , and @entity34			1
@entity112 says women and children continue to be abducted			0
and it says @entity34 continues to kill in large numbers			1
beyond that , more than 200 schoolgirls who had gathered one year ago to take their science exam are still missing			0
their families are still bereft			2
and tuesday on @entity69 , a hashtag was still trending : # @entity71 .			0
