recently , a @entity1 judge issued an opinion authorizing service of divorce papers on a husband completely via @entity7			1
what exactly is " service of process " ? serving people with legal papers is an industry and its own body of law premised on one guiding principle : if you are going to sue someone , you should at least let them know about it			1
sounds simple , right ? in theory it is			1
in practice , it turns out people do n't like being sued			1
it also turns out that , to many defendants , procrastination of a lawsuit is a viable defense			1
just as you may avoid bad news in life , defendants tend to avoid process servers			2
once a defendant has been served , that means the judicial proceedings begin			2
unfortunately , that means defendants have an incentive to go " off the grid "			2
although every state is different , the law of service of process has evolved this way : the ideal and fairest way to notify a person of a lawsuit is to have another human hand the papers to the defendant in person , and have some proof that the person was the defendant			1
in - person service is not always possible , for obvious reasons			2
so , the law had to develop methods of alternate service , but carefully balance a defendant 's right to have notice of a lawsuit , against a diligent plaintiff 's access to court if a defendant is avoiding the inevitable			1
as reliable as the @entity69 mail is , regular mail is not a reliable form of serving papers			1
not because the postmen ca n't be trusted ; they can			2
neither snow , nor rain , nor heat , nor gloom of night , will keep them from delivering those papers			1
instead , it 's defendants -- no wait , all of humanity -- that ca n't be trusted			2
every one of us has ignored mail or even pretended we did n't get it			2
one form of alternate service is " nail and mail " service			2
this means that you take a hammer and nail , and nail the papers to the defendant 's front door			1
the problem with that is that many defendants are nomadic by nature			0
just because you find a house that a defendant stayed at , does n't mean he 'll be back there anytime soon			0
another , even odder form of " service " is service by publication			0
this is an almost laughable legal fiction			0
if you ca n't find a defendant , a judge might let you serve by publication			1
that means that a plaintiff can take out an ad in five point font for a week in an obscure publication , on the off chance you are reading the classified ads of the @entity123 looking for lawsuits against you			0
as laughable as serving someone by tweeting it sounds , it 's at least more rational than this antiquated method			0
at first blush , the idea of service by @entity7 seems to offend traditional notions of ensuring notification of a defendant of a case against him			1
when it comes to serving papers , however , " traditional " does n't necessarily mean " good			1
" service by publication or nailing paper to the door of an empty apartment is hardly reliable ; it 's just service of last resort			0
for those people who are concerned that being served papers will become a @entity7 announcement in a news feed , along with the photos of dinner or kittens , to be " liked " by all your gawking " friends , " we 're not quite there ... yet			1
while the older forms of alternate service were public , most electronic service takes the form of email			0
where email is n't available , it is @entity7 private messaging , which should be as private as email			1
that 's the form of service authorized by the court here			1
so for now , we 're not quite putting lawsuits on @entity168 ... but i would n't rule it out in the future			0
online service may be a new frontier , but it 's not unheard of			0
most of us exist more online now than we " live " in a particular condo , or @entity177 's basement			0
virtually everyone has a phone or access to the @entity181			0
not everyone has a lease or a mortgage			0
plus , online service has the added benefit of tracking			0
believe me , somewhere , some computer has already logged the fact that you read this article , how long you read it , and even how far down you scrolled before you got bored and bailed on the article ( thanks for still being here , by the way )			0
in a way , maybe online service is long overdue			0
you can outrun a process server for a while , but sooner or later , all of us have to go back online -- and no human can outrun an email .			0
