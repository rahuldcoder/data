-- on a legal pad next to my father 's armchair , i see my name in his handwriting			1
it 's between " @entity9 tickets " and " taxes , " on a list that also includes such excellent questions as " @entity13 ? " and " wine ? " -- and it 's crossed off			1
and sitting in the half dark , with my own two children asleep in the next room , it occurs to me that the details of parental devotion are nothing you can quite put into words			1
i mean , you could stand all day in an aisle of @entity26 , reading four - line stanzas about paternal strength and character , and plenty would be true enough			1
" i was an ungrateful louse , but you still sent me to college -- thanks , " they assert in various rhyming couplets , with maybe something about ice fishing and neckties			1
" you taught me to throw a football ; you gave me away at the altar ; you left our house with a briefcase every day and we never knew where you were actually going			1
but where 's the part about the flush of care you feel when you see your own grown - up self on your dad 's to - do list ? you worry , you call me , you cross me out			1
because as a father there 's none more devout than you , @entity56			2
i would buy that card			1
or the one about perching your little - girl self on the closed lid of the toilet to watch your handsome father shave -- his lips pressed together in the mirror while foam disappeared in wide stripes like a mown lawn			1
although i would want the card to skip the part about how , years later , your future husband would also use @entity70 , and the clovey smoothness of his cheek against your neck would fan the flames of passion into something more like a bonfire of heebie - jeebies			1
@entity0 : the best @entity81 gifts the same way you felt when you realized that @entity89 's " @entity88 " was actually about somebody 's lover -- not their dad , like you 'd always imagined			1
not really about somebody 's father			2
and yet i was exactly the kind of kid who imagined that you grew up and married your own actual dad			1
( did he still walk you down the aisle ? what did your mom wear ? i had n't worked out the details			2
) i wandered the house to be wherever he was : on the carpet at his feet while he rattled ice in a glass and shared pretzel @entity107 with me ; on a kitchen stool while he soft - boiled eggs ; flung across the bed with my chin in my palms while he emptied the pockets of his suit -- subway tokens , handfuls of change , a clacking box of mints			1
he seemed like a cross between a magician and a billionaire philanthropist			2
( " would you like a @entity124 ? " " would i ! " ) plus , there was the omniscience			2
@entity0 : are you turning into your father ? even now , if we 're heading downtown , he cheerfully shakes open the subway map to show us the l train , to remind us to get off the n before it zooms into @entity133			2
i watch his finger point here and there along the colored veins of the city , and i feel like we 'll never be lost ; i feel like if we were ever lost he 'd come out to @entity139 and get us ; i 'm knocking on 40 's door and i have two children of my own and what i feel like is somebody 's kid			2
" there 's a great sushi place near there , " he might recommend , or " i would take the @entity155 , " and his confidence fills me with something like relief crossed with something that can only be described as a kind of preemptive grief			2
i want to always feel like somebody 's kid			0
explain the @entity157 to me again , @entity56			0
if he was in the shower when we left for school , he drew a circle and a dot on the fogged - up glass of the door for " goodbye			0
" if we flew somewhere without him , he met us at the airport , always wearing the same red - and - blue - checked cotton shirt that jellied my knees with the gladness of seeing him again			0
" who do you love most ? " i asked , " @entity173 or me ? " and he said , " do n't be silly -- your mother , of course			0
" he was not exactly kidding , and we screamed with indignation and glee : our beautiful mother ! we felt the same way ! years later , though , our father would fall unpredictably and somewhat dottily in love with a brown @entity183 poodle			0
what a relief to raise a dog after the worry and complexity of children ! or so i imagine			0
@entity0 : books men want opinions did not need to be proffered about the dog 's tone of voice , length of shorts , or sulky posture at her grandmother 's dinner table -- or about how close to her eyeball the dog penciled in a smudge of black liner			0
the dog needed to be on a leash , sure , but not to keep her from growing up too quickly			0
and the dog was able to spend her whole life just wagging around our father in her needy way -- " look at me ! look at me ! i 'm your dog ! are n't i great ? " -- without even pretending to mature and make adult conversation			0
you did n't want me to grow up too quickly only now i 'm not sure i can at all			0
uh-oh , @entity56 ! @entity0 : men who behave @entity215 : the life of the full - time father these days i watch my own young children with their father			0
our daughter rubs her cheek on his and complains dotingly about its roughness ; our son curls up in his lap , big - kid legs folded up like a giraffe 's			0
they reach sleepy arms from late - night car seats , and their dad lifts them , carries them , whispers " i 've got you " and means it in every possible way			1
years later , maybe they 'll roll their eyes when he counts the holes in their earlobes or frets over their berserk finances ; maybe they 'll rage and rebel and grow more independent than i ever have			0
but one day these kids , too , will scan the drugstore aisle for the right card that wo n't be there -- the one that says , i know it 's a pain in the neck , @entity56 , but it means the world to me -- your agreeing to live forever			1

author : a *personal* @entity81 *message* that says more than a card
@entity270 *reminisces* about watching her dad shave and empty change from his pockets
she was one of those girls who imagined she would marry her dad when she grew up
