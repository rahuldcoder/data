-- @entity1 says he needs to beat @entity2 for a second time in @entity4 on saturday to move on from the controversial conclusion of their first fight two years ago			1
the @entity9 welterweight champion won a contentious points decision when the pair met in june 2012 , inflicting a first defeat on @entity2 in seven years			1
boxing commentators roundly criticized the result while former heavyweight champion @entity15 said the scoring showed that boxing had lost its integrity			0
@entity1 claims he subsequently received death threats and that he was unfairly targeted by fans and the media alike for the decision of the ringside judges			1
" it would mean the world to me to get this victory for me and my family because of everything we went through in the past , " the 30 - year old told @entity0 's @entity25			2
" it was like i stole something from the world that night			0
all i did was do my job			0
people ridiculed me , demonized me			0
" @entity1 insists these dark experiences made him stronger as a person and will act as the perfect motivation ahead of the @entity41 rematch			1
he questioned @entity2 's hunger at the pre-fight press conference thursday , suggesting the legendary @entity44 's best days are behind him			2
@entity2 has won world titles at seven weight divisions in a career stretching 18 years but has lost two of his last three fights			2
" what really motivates me for this fight is what my opponent said , " @entity2 countered in riposte to @entity1 's claims			1
" he said i do n't have the killer instinct any more , i do n't have the aggressiveness any more			0
this helps me , it helps a lot			0
" although he recorded a comfortable victory over @entity62 last november , @entity2 was knocked out for the first time since 1999 by @entity64 in his previous bout			1
at 35 , it would be difficult for @entity2 to resurrect his career at the very highest level if defeated by @entity1 for a second time but he refuses to entertain this notion ahead of the contest			1
" my mind is set in the winners side not on the losers side , " he said			0
" i always think positive and not negative			0
" " this fight on saturday will be to prove that my journey in boxing will continue and i 'm excited for that			2
