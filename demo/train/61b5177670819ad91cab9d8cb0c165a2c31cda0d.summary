@entity0 , @entity1 -- i certainly did n't anticipate this turn of events : that more than 200 @entity1 girls , students kidnapped from their hostels in dead of night , would still be missing , and with their abductors , for 100 days in peacetime , democratic @entity1			1
the agony of the girls , and more specifically of their parents , has haunted the country since			1
in those weeks , at least 11 of the parents have died : seven of the fathers were among 51 bodies taken to hospital in @entity21 after the terrorists attacked @entity23 , just nearby , and at least four are confirmed to have died of heart failure , high blood pressure and other illnesses			2
" one father of two of the girls kidnapped just went into a kind of coma and kept repeating the names of his daughters , until life left him , '' a community leader , @entity28 told the @entity29			1
there is a sense of disbelief among protesters and @entity1 generally -- from across the world			2
citizens whisper to themselves in malls , at parties , in the markets , across offices , at newspaper vendor stands and in airport terminals			2
we knew things were bad ; but we did n't know they were so bad that the @entity1 government would be incapable of securing even this symbolic victory over the terrorist @entity56 for more than 100 days			1
when did we become the kind of country where this happens ? well , it certainly has been a long time coming			0
years of political infighting between the ruling and opposition parties led to a breakdown of trust and cooperation across state and federal government agencies ; the one suspecting the other of using the terrorists to win political advantage			1
the relative inaction has only emboldened @entity56 , which these days invades communities , taunts @entity1 in videos ( including the latest this week by its leader @entity75 ) , and hoists flags in villages with the ease of an advancing army			1
opinion : @entity1 's kidnapped girls not forgotten the 100 - day marker for the kidnap of the @entity21 girls stands as the highest symbol for the failure of the @entity1 state to protect its citizens , to defend its territory , to inspire hope			1
from the two weeks it took president @entity94 to officially acknowledge the scale of the problem to the relentless cross-government attack against citizen protesters , there has been a sense that the authorities are more interested in protecting their offices , than restoring confidence			0
it does n't help that it took the president 99 days to even meet the parents of the missing girls and only after a foreigner , @entity108 's @entity107 had pleaded			1
it does n't help that , apparently , the 50 - plus girls who escaped captivity have not immediately been taken under the wings of the government			2
it does n't help that the country 's secret service has taken to harassing leaders of the # @entity120 campaign at international airports			1
it has become a broken record : the government says it knows the location of the girls			0
but this offers little comfort , as little comfort as the lack of information as to how exactly the international community is helping , since it has no boots on the ground			0
the meeting with the parents on tuesday hopefully opens a new chapter in efforts to find these people			0
for one , the much talked about empathy that has won this president the hearts of @entity1 was on display			2
whether manufactured or not , it gave at least a ray of hope for a thirsty citizenry -- as we gather wednesday in marches across the world , from @entity0 to @entity151 , @entity152 to @entity153			0
maybe this will be the beginning of stronger cooperation between the @entity21 community and its federal government ; maybe it will signify a thawing of relations between the presidency and the opposition state government			0
maybe it will finally convince the president that protesters , like the parents , do not wish his downfall , they only want a slice of hope			0
in a politically charged climate , where everything is interpreted against the backdrop of the coming 2015 general elections , this might be little more than futile hope			0
but as we ponder the fates of at least 219 young women , caught in the @entity181 forest , surrounded by mosquitoes , spiders , dirty waters , deadly snakes and deranged fundamentalists , hope -- unfortunately -- is all we can afford			0
