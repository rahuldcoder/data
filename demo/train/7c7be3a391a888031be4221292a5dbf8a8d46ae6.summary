-- long a pillar of @entity4 's three - decade rule over @entity5 , @entity1 now sits at the top of the pyramid as its de facto president			1
under pressure from street demonstrations calling for his ouster , @entity4 named his veteran spymaster to the long - vacant vice presidency in late january			0
@entity1 quickly became the face of the government 's reform pledges , announcing talks with opposition leaders and promising swift reforms			1
but @entity4 's february 1 announcement that he would step down when his term ends in september failed to satisfy the crowds in @entity24 's @entity23 and other cities			1
attacks on demonstrators by pro-government crowds in the following days failed to dislodge the demonstrators , whose ranks were bolstered when thousands of workers in several industries went on strike thursday			0
after a day of intense speculation , @entity4 repeated that he would remain in office to serve out his term -- but he announced that he was delegating power to @entity1 , who quickly urged @entity5 to go home and get back to work			1
" we call upon you to unite , and to think rationally and to look forward to the future , " @entity1 said in a televised speech that followed @entity4 's			1
but the vice president , whose agents are among the fingers of @entity4 's iron hand , was n't seen as much of an improvement by opposition figures			1
" @entity4 is only one part of this regime , " human rights activist @entity49 , one of the @entity23 protesters , said			0
" people have been here for 17 days , and they are not for @entity1 either			0
@entity4 has lost all legitimacy , and now him handing over the power to the vice president is as illegitimate as @entity4 being in power			2
" and in @entity60 , protesters met the announcement with chants of " no to @entity4 , no to @entity1			1
" a former general who trained under both the @entity64 and @entity65 during the @entity66 , @entity1 took over @entity5 's @entity68 intelligence agency in 1993			1
he is credited with leading @entity4 's efforts to crush an @entity71 insurgency in the 1990s			1
that earned him the ear of @entity75 intelligence officials thirsting for vital information about regional terrorist groups , and he became a key intermediary in @entity81 - @entity80 peace talks			0
" he is basically your main go - to guy in @entity5 , " former deputy cia director @entity82 said			0
@entity1 has been " helpful in many arenas , " including the @entity81 - @entity80 peace process			0
a 2006 cable from the @entity87 in @entity24 , disclosed by the @entity89 website in january , called intelligence collaboration with @entity1 " probably the most successful element " of the @entity64 relationship with @entity5			1
but that relationship is " a little like being in bed with the @entity96 , " author @entity93 told @entity0 's " @entity97			0
" " if someone knocks on your door at night and you disappear , @entity1 is probably behind it , " said @entity93 , whose 2006 book " @entity99 " detailed the @entity102 administration 's post- 9/11 counterterrorism policies			2
" he is a feared man , and certainly not a man with any legitimacy when it comes to rule of law or any of the principles we prized in @entity64			0
" in 2002 , @entity113 captive @entity120 " was tortured rather dramatically " by @entity1 's agents , @entity93 said , yielding a " confession " that @entity115 had trained the terrorist group in the use of chemical and biological weapons			2
his assertion was a key point in the @entity102 administration 's arguments for the 2003 invasion of @entity115 , but he recanted it once back in @entity64 hands			2
that sort of history leaves an opening for critics to question @entity64 support for democratic change in @entity5 , @entity93 said			2
" the fact is , we are allied with the people they 're trying to overthrow , and right now the @entity64 has n't done much to separate those bonds , " he said			0
@entity1 had long been mentioned as a possible successor to @entity4 , along with the aging ruler 's son , @entity140			1
a 2007 @entity64 cable called his loyalty to @entity4 " rock solid , " and some analysts viewed his vice presidential appointment as a way for @entity4 to make a graceful exit			2
@entity1 is even credited with saving @entity4 's life			1
on a state visit to @entity151 in 1995 , @entity4 was to have traveled in a normal vehicle but @entity1 insisted that the president 's armored @entity153 be flown in from @entity24			1
accounts of an assassination attempt on @entity4 vary but it 's believed that @entity1 was sitting next to @entity4 when a hail of bullets pinged off the car			1
the bond forged that day cemented their relationship			0
but @entity1 's attempts at dialogue with opposition parties were derided by protesters , and the @entity169 administration criticized the talks for including too few opposition groups			2
vice president @entity172 told @entity1 on tuesday that @entity5 needed " immediate , irreversible progress " toward meeting protesters ' demands , and leading opposition figure @entity175 said @entity1 and @entity4 " are twins			1
" " this is an act of deception at a grand scale , " @entity175 said			0
@entity181 , a professor of @entity183 politics at @entity184 , said @entity4 's thursday speech did him little good			1
not only was it too little , too late , he said , but his announcement that he was ceding power to @entity1 was buried in an " incredibly patronizing " speech			2
" had he done this a couple of weeks ago , it actually may have done something , " @entity181 said			0
but now , he said , " all the constitutional , legal tools are in their hands , and it does n't ' do them any good			0
so i do n't think they 're sure what to do			0
" @entity0 's @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 , the former intelligence chief , now *wields* most power in @entity5
an opposition leader dismisses him as @entity4 's " twin "
@entity1 has had close ties with @entity64 officials
