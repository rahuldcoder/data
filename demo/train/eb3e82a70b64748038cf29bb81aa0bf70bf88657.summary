on march 17 , 2011 a drone attack killed at least 40 members of a @entity2 , which was resolving a land ownership dispute among sub-tribes in @entity5 , a mountainous region in northwest @entity6 , according to local media reports			1
the reports claimed the @entity2 was not the intended target and the predator was chasing a car before finally executing five people without any trial or due process near the jirga			0
while this predator was hovering in the area , sophisticated cameras allegedly picked up images of a bigger gathering			0
without appearing to have any intelligence or knowledge of its target , it fired four more missiles at the congregation			0
in the same month , a joint investigation by the @entity32 - based @entity31 ( @entity31 ) and the @entity34 newspaper cited @entity6 's military commander in @entity5 at the time , brigadier @entity35 : " we in the @entity6 military knew about the meeting , we 'd got the request 10 days earlier			1
it was held in broad daylight , people were sitting out in @entity42 bus depot when the missile strikes came			0
maybe there were one or two @entity45 at that @entity2 -- they have their people attending -- but does that justify a drone strike which kills 42 mostly innocent people ? " opinion : drone is @entity53 's weapon of choice there should never be doubts			1
a big gathering in @entity5 does not mean they must be @entity45			0
to put it in perspective : my clients say drone attacks are now happening almost twice a week on @entity6 soil			1
@entity64 , a tribal man by origin and a journalist by profession , is suing the @entity68 ( @entity68 ) for @entity69 $ 500 million for " his loss of blood			1
" he had only two options when his innocent 18 - year - old son and brother , a primary school teacher , were killed in one such drone attack on december 31 , 2009 : to join the @entity45 's war against the @entity69 and take his revenge in a customary tribal way , or call on due process , the rule of law and judicial system of his state to gain justice for the wrong done to him			1
the first option would have continued the cycle of terror , which we witness in @entity6 in the shape of suicide attacks after almost every drone attack			1
@entity64 chose the latter and following him , dozens more families have come forth to seek justice through proper legal means			0
it is time now for the @entity69 to respond to these grievances through legal means			2
read : when are drone killings illegal ? a similar fate awaited @entity104 , a teenager and another client from @entity5			0
@entity69 president @entity53 , the embodiment of " change " and " hope , " approved an escalation of the drone strikes in @entity6 by giving the @entity68 and @entity69 military control of the program			1
@entity104 's family house was destroyed by one such attack			0
the attack on january 23 , 2009 resulted in the deaths of seven people present in the house , including three of @entity104 's uncles , a cousin , and three family friends			0
@entity104 was seriously injured and lost one eye			0
according to the @entity123 , president @entity53 was later informed of this attack and civilian killings			1
the change he brought in was a record escalation of drone strikes in 2009 , culminating in 344 attacks at the expense of 3,325 lives to date , according to @entity31			2
the escalation would also change @entity104 's life forever			0
the @entity69 might never be able to win the " heart and mind " of this teenager from @entity6 's tribal area , who paid a high prize for faulty intelligence , a common mistake that @entity68 makes without any accountability			1
under the authority of the @entity69 president , drone attacks on @entity6 territory have been carried out by the @entity68 and @entity69 military since 2004			1
this is an unprecedented move : a foreign government carrying out military strikes on an independent and sovereign state without declaring war			0
earlier this year , @entity153 , the @entity155 ' @entity154 on extrajudicial killings , warned that @entity157 was challenging a system of international law that had existed since the end of @entity161 and that it could even be guilty of war crimes			0
the government of @entity6 has consistently maintained that drone attacks are a violation of its territorial integrity and sovereignty			1
read : drones decimating @entity45 in @entity6 what astounds me is the belief expressed by some scholars and politicians that drones are the only viable option for combating terrorism or militancy in the tribal areas of @entity6			2
experience and statistics tell a different story			0
the first drone attack was carried out in 2004 and had a specific target			1
this was true for all nine drone attacks that took place until 2007			1
however , identifying targets became shady as the number of strikes increased			0
after president @entity53 's oath of office , the drone attacks saw a sudden surge , accelerating from an average of one strike every 40 days to one every four days by mid- 2011 , according to the @entity195			1
the @entity31 said available data showed from june 2004 to september 2012 , drone strikes have killed 2,570 to 3,337 people in @entity6 , of whom 474 to 884 were civilians -- including 176 children			1
as a result of these attacks , the @entity69 has only been able to achieve 41 high value targets , according to estimates by the @entity195			2
we have seen that with every assassination of militant leaders , they have been replaced with a more ferocious and extremist leader			0
meanwhile , journalist @entity211 told @entity212 in a response to an article he 'd written in the @entity123 , " there 's also been some dispute over the way civilian casualties are counted			0
the @entity68 often counts able - bodied males , military - age males who are killed in strikes as militants , unless they have concrete evidence to sort of prove them innocent , and some folks at the @entity224 and elsewhere have questioned that kind of a process			1
" as a result , most adult males living in @entity5 seem to be viewed as militants and targets until the @entity68 rates them to be innocent , he added			2
@entity6 has also experienced a spike in suicide attacks when there has been a surge in drone attacks			1
in 2010 , the year that saw the highest number of drone strikes , according to @entity31 , @entity6 government figures suggest the country witnessed its highest number of suicide attacks -- more than 2,100 civilians were killed without distinction between women , children , law enforcement or military			1
according to the @entity6 government , the total financial loss from terrorism in @entity6 between 2001 - 2010 was $ 68 billion , whereas the epicenter of all this chaos in our midst , the @entity69 , has given only $ 11 billion in military aid to @entity6 for its war on terror since 2001 , according to the @entity259 at @entity260			1
a large portion of this damage is attributed to suicide attacks			0
@entity69 's own losses in @entity266 -- financial , human , and tactical -- are difficult to quantify			2
according to the @entity267 ( @entity267 ) , more than $ 6 billion has been spent since 2002 on establishing a viable @entity268 , which the late @entity269 called " an inadequate force riddled with corruption , " during a meeting in @entity273 in 2009			0
the @entity267 says more than $ 10 billion of @entity69 taxpayers ' money has been spent on building up the @entity276 , which was described in a report in the @entity278 on july 28 , 2010 as largely corrupt , poorly led , and subject to claims of drug use			2
the joint @entity282 and @entity266 @entity283 in @entity266 's @entity284 in february 2010 failed miserably in achieving its aimed objectives of evicting the @entity45 and establishing a government in the district , despite the enormous budget and military backing of the @entity69			1
earlier this year , @entity69 senator @entity290 concluded that the operation did not become the turning point in the @entity266 campaign as anticipated by @entity282 commanders			2
in fact 2011 - 2012 witnessed a surge in @entity45 attacks on @entity282 and particularly @entity69 targets , showing there is no end to this war			2
this cycle of terror will continue until both sides start seeing sense and start adhering to the principles of due process , fair play , and rule of law			0
through legal action , @entity64 -- the first of 80 clients who came to us seeking justice for these attacks -- has shown a new path to his people to end the violence , which is largely attributed to mistakes committed by the state in the 1980s , along with the very same partner who is asking us to commit yet another folly			2
the @entity69 public should ask their government who is being killed in their name			2
questioning the drone program in light of real facts is not anti-american -- violating the rule of law , due process and the " right to life " is			0
