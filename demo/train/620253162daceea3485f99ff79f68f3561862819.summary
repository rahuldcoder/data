for the first time , a patient in an @entity2 hospital has been diagnosed with @entity4			1
the unidentified man , who is being treated at a @entity7 hospital , did n't show symptoms until several days after he arrived in the @entity2 from @entity9			1
officials are tight - lipped about how he contracted the virus or how he 's being treated , citing privacy concerns			2
but shortly after the news broke tuesday evening , more than 50,000 tweets about @entity4 flew through @entity17 in a one - hour period , many of them panicked responses			1
should we be concerned ? the short answer : no. now let 's get to the long answer			0
could the patient 's fellow passengers be infected ? the patient being treated in @entity27 flew from one of the @entity4 hot zones -- @entity9 -- to @entity7			1
but his fellow passengers are n't thought to be at risk because you can only contract @entity4 through direct contact with the bodily fluids of someone who 's actively sick with it			1
it 's not like a cold or the flu , which can be spread before symptoms show up			1
and it does n't spread through the air			0
" it 's very unlikely that ( @entity4 victims ) would be able to spread the disease to fellow passengers , " said @entity44 of the @entity45			1
what 's to stop other @entity4 patients from getting on a flight and coming here ? the @entity45 has issued warnings to avoid nonessential travel to @entity9 , @entity56 and @entity57 , the countries hit the hardest by the outbreak			1
and it 's also working with airport officials in those nations , and in @entity64 , so every person getting on a plane is screened for fever			1
" and if they have a fever , they are pulled out of the line , assessed for @entity4 and do n't fly unless @entity4 is ruled out , " @entity45 director dr. @entity66 said			1
how do airport authorities know what to look for ? those stricken with @entity4 suffer ghastly symptoms -- including vomiting , diarrhea , muscle pain , fever and unexplained bleeding			1
that 's part of the reason why the odds of getting @entity4 from plane passengers is very low , the @entity80 said			1
" it is highly unlikely that someone suffering such symptoms would feel well enough to travel			2
" what 's being done when the planes land in the @entity2 ? the @entity2 is n't planning on banning flights coming from the hot zones in @entity95 , @entity92 spokesman @entity91 said in august			0
but once flights land at a @entity2 airport from one of those countries , passengers are screened again			1
" and there are facilities available that if an individual is detected exhibiting these symptoms , that they can be quarantined and promptly evaluated by a medical professional , " @entity91 said			2
are those procedures being followed ? @entity107 senior medical correspondent @entity106 said when she and two colleagues recently returned from reporting in @entity9 , they got a mixed bag of responses from @entity113 officers			0
" we all said we were journalists who had just been in @entity9 covering @entity4 , " @entity106 said			2
" one of my colleagues was told , ' oh , ok , welcome back home , sir ' -- and ( was ) just let in -- that was it			0
" @entity106 herself got a different response			0
" i was told , ' wait a minute , i think i got an email about this , ' and the border patrol officer went and consulted with his colleagues , " @entity106 said			0
that officer later told her she should check her system for 21 days			2
" i said , ' what should i be checking ? ' and he was n't sure , " @entity106 said			0
the third colleague merely had his boots checked to see if there was mud on them			0
" three very different responses			0
they ca n't all be the way to do it , " @entity106 said			0
" i was surprised at how sort of chaotic it felt			0
" so , how did @entity7 patient slip through ? the @entity4 patient in @entity7 did n't start showing symptoms until several days after he landed in the @entity2 , @entity66 said			1
is n't he putting others at risk ? the paramedics who took the patient to the hospital have been isolated , the chief of staff for @entity7 mayor @entity145 told @entity107			1
they have not shown symptoms of the disease so far			0
the ambulance that carried the patient -- ambulance no. 37 -- was in use for two days after the transport but was properly decontaminated , said @entity7 city spokeswoman @entity156			1
@entity66 said the patient himself had a handful of contacts with people after he fell ill and before he was isolated -- a period of about four days			2
a @entity45 team arrived in @entity27 to investigate the people who came in contact with the man			1
those people will be monitored for 21 days to see if they develop symptoms			2
if they do , they 'll be isolated			0
" it is certainly possible that someone who had contact with this individual could develop @entity4 in the coming weeks , " @entity66 said			1
" but there is no doubt in my mind that we will stop it here			0
" how is this not concerning ? although there 's no vaccine and no cure , the one real advantage we have with @entity4 is that doctors know how to control it			2
@entity4 is n't " some mystical pathogen ( with ) some bizarre mode of transmission , " said @entity186 , director of @entity188 's @entity187			1
and we have the resources to contain it			0
how are we so confident ? for starters , the @entity2 has the luxury of better health care compared to @entity9 , @entity56 and @entity57			0
the @entity2 has facilities that can " do the kind of isolation that apparently is very difficult to do within the health care infrastructure in the @entity199 countries that we are talking about , " said dr. @entity201 of the @entity202			0
secondly , remember @entity203 and @entity204 ? the doctor and the @entity2 missionary were infected in @entity9 , brought to @entity207 's @entity188 , placed in isolation units , treated and discharged			0
they were the first humans with @entity4 to ever arrive in the @entity2			2
and they are now fine .			0

unlike a cold or the flu , @entity4 can not be transmitted before symptoms show up
@entity45 director : all passengers *boarding* from @entity4 *hotspots* are screened for fever
a man being treated for @entity4 in @entity7 had symptoms for about 4 days before he was isolated
@entity45 team trying to find those who came in contact with him ; will monitor them for symptoms
