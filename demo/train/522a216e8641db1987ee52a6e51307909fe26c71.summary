-- @entity1 rolled out a web - based on - demand television and movie service on tuesday that gives customers access to more than 2,000 hours of television and movies			1
the move comes as users increasingly are bypassing their tv sets and heading straight to the @entity10 -- both legally and illegally -- to watch their favorite shows			1
the service , named @entity13 ( formerly called @entity14 ) , is the biggest cable industry initiative to keep people from skipping traditional tv service in the @entity18			1
" i watch tv online every day			0
i find it more convenient than my regular tv ... , " @entity21 , a self - employed computer repairman from @entity23 , @entity24 , said via e-mail			0
" i 'm usually watching tv on one window while reading e-mail or tweets on another			0
" and also my time is important , so sitting down and watching a show at 8 or 9 p.m. is n't convenient			0
@entity34 allows me to watch what i want when i want			0
" networks have tried for the past couple of years to find a way to reach @entity10 - watching audiences by streaming content on their web sites or making partnerships with @entity43 , one of the larger online tv sites			1
now , @entity1 is hoping it can make a dent in the market by serving up premium content			1
it is available to all @entity1 customers , so long as they subscribe to both @entity52 and cable service			1
@entity21 said he does n't expect to give up @entity43 , though many of the same episodes and web clips will be available on @entity13			0
@entity21 , trying out the site tuesday after it went live , tweeted that he thought the service was " awesome , " and he finally had a place where he could watch the entire series of " @entity61			1
" " the quality , it 's really clear and loads fast , " he said , though he noted there were still some bugs in the product			2
@entity21 occasionally had to reload the site , and felt that installing the video player and authorizing the computer took a bit more time and was harder than simply pressing play on @entity43			2
the service is getting mixed reviews on @entity74 , with customers giving instant feedback about their experiences			0
some complained that high - definition videos , which are available on @entity43 , are not available on @entity1 's service			1
others complained about having to download a separate video player , the service not being compatible with the @entity84 operating system , and only being able to authorize the service on a total of three computers			0
@entity1 hopes to wow customers even more in the future			2
in the next six months , after the service has gone through more beta testing , the company plans to open the service to a broader customer base			0
customers will be able to access all content -- depending on the tiered level of service they subscribe to			1
those not paying for @entity96 regularly , for example , wo n't be able to snag the newest episode of " @entity98 " online			2
in addition to catching up with sites like @entity43 and @entity102 , @entity1 executives told media outlets they expect to serve up a feature that @entity106 fans have come to love -- allowing customers to program their dvr from afar			2
executives said they hope the service would be available in about six months			0
to access the content , users simply need to log in with their @entity1 e-mail address at @entity113			1
the site is offering live online help , including help retrieving those addresses .			0

@entity1 's @entity119 goes live tuesday for its @entity52 , tv subscribers
service follows trend of trying to keep users from *abandoning* cable tv for web
site allows users access to premium content , like @entity96 , if they subscribe
new user finds a few bugs , but calls site " awesome " for its *selection* and load time
