-- the debate over funding for the @entity3 continued wednesday as federal officials traveled to @entity5 and @entity6 to check on local recovery and response efforts after @entity9			1
the agency 's disaster relief fund has less than $ 800 million remaining and could run out before the end of the current fiscal year on september 30			2
with conservative @entity14 , led by rep. @entity15 , @entity16 , calling for spending cuts to offset any increase in emergency funds -- a measure opposed by many @entity21 -- the ability of @entity23 to act quickly on the issue remains uncertain			1
" right now , we 're continuing our obligations to respond " with rescue operations and meeting the immediate needs of storm survivors , @entity3 administrator @entity25 said wednesday			2
the only thing the agency has done , he said , is state that it wo n't be able to fund permanent work from disasters that has not yet been started			1
" we are postponing the permanent work , " he said			2
but search - and - rescue teams are on the ground , he said , and food and water is being handed out to those in need			2
" this is a team effort , " he said			2
" ... @entity43 help @entity43 in disasters			1
we 're doing our job			2
" mayor @entity47 of @entity48 , @entity5 , said he was " outraged " about the funding dispute			1
" @entity50 has a mind of her own , a will of her own , and we ca n't have the petty wrangling going on when we have folks in dire need , " he said			1
gov. @entity57 echoed those sentiments during a news conference wednesday , saying , " we do n't have time to wait for folks in @entity23 to figure out how they want to offset this stuff with the budget cuts			1
our people are suffering now			1
and they need support now			1
" " nobody that got hit with this flooding dodged a bullet , " @entity25 said wednesday			2
" loss of life , extensive damages , homes flooded			2
... it may not have been as big a deal on the coast , but these flood areas definitely got hit hard			1
" @entity77 killed 43 people from @entity79 to @entity80 as it marched up the @entity82 over the weekend , dumping torrential rain			1
some of the worst flooding struck @entity85 , @entity5 and upstate @entity6			1
more than 1.8 million customers remained without electricity wednesday from @entity89 to @entity90 , the @entity43 @entity86 said -- a decrease from the 2.8 million reported tuesday afternoon			1
outage figures include more than 366,000 in @entity93 and 323,000 in @entity6			2
the @entity94 in northern @entity5 seemed to mock the town of @entity96 as the water surging through it looked more like @entity98			1
" before @entity77 hit , the @entity94 was already running high from frequent precipitation this summer , " @entity99 of neighboring @entity100 said			2
" when the hurricane blew through and dumped all that water on @entity105 , the river began to rage			2
" about 1,700 residents were evacuated from their homes in @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity96 , @entity48 and @entity110 , said @entity111 , a spokesman for @entity113 's @entity112			2
president @entity115 will travel to @entity48 on sunday to view damage from @entity9 , the @entity114 announced			2
rescues were still taking place wednesday , @entity47 said			0
" all it takes is someone to call and say they 're under distress , and we and our boats are going out and taking people to safety , " he said			1
city officials were opening schools and other facilities to serve as shelters , he said			0
" it 's been pretty much 24 hours a day , " said sgt. @entity131 of the @entity132			0
once floodwaters begin to recede , the next step will include going house to house and checking furnaces , hot water heaters and other appliances to reduce the risk of explosions when they are restarted , @entity47 said			0
asked about those who did not heed an evacuation warning , @entity47 said , " i do n't think folks were aware -- nor were we aware -- that it could get this extreme			1
" flood warnings remained in effect for portions of @entity5 on wednesday , along with parts of @entity89 , @entity16 , @entity153 , @entity6 , @entity93 and @entity154			1
also wednesday , @entity115 signed disaster declarations for @entity5 , @entity89 and @entity6			1
" i think the conversation of hype is being hyped , " @entity93 gov. @entity156 said wednesday on the debate over whether @entity77 was overhyped			1
" the reality is , the people of @entity93 are hurting			1
... although it 's sunny outside , we 're still experiencing the effects			1
" he said homes and infrastructure have been destroyed and the @entity169 basin has experienced heavy flooding			0
much of the damage is seen in the state 's rural areas , he said			0
" we have farms that are under water			0
" @entity177 reported that it met its goal to restore power to nearly all @entity181 customers by tuesday night , @entity6 gov. @entity176 said in a statement wednesday			1
work to restore power elsewhere was ongoing wednesday			1
the full extent of @entity77 's destruction wo n't be known for some time			1
the federal government estimates that the cost from wind damage alone will exceed $ 1 billion			0
analysts have put the total expected cost of @entity77 much higher			0
@entity85 transportation officials were able to make emergency repairs on roads to all but one of about a dozen previously isolated towns , officials said			0
air drops were being made to three towns			0
the @entity199 is carrying supplies to other communities , said @entity202 , spokesman for @entity203			0
because the repaired roads are intended for emergency and supply delivery traffic , residents will have to wait for more permanent repairs to resume their old driving habits			1
that is expected to take at least several weeks or months in some cases			0
" we 've transitioned into the recovery stage for the most part , " @entity202 said			0
" the worst is over			0
" the @entity215 reported that only two of its seven member campgrounds suffered significant damage , and more than 70 campgrounds will be open for the coming @entity220			0
" some are cleaning up downed trees , but most are ready for visitors , " said @entity221 , the association 's executive director , in a prepared statement			0
most roads leading to campgrounds are open , the association said			0
the two campgrounds that suffered extensive damage -- camping on the @entity233 in @entity234 and @entity235 in @entity236 -- remained closed			0
storm cleanup efforts also were ongoing in the @entity238 on wednesday , a week after @entity77 struck there			0
the @entity239 was coordinating the shipment of goods to @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 and @entity245 , according to @entity246			0
a shipment of goods from @entity249 was received by @entity250 on saturday			0
meanwhile , some of the areas that escaped @entity77 without major damage -- such as the state of @entity255 -- still took a direct hit in the pocketbook			0
@entity255 lost more than $ 2 million in direct revenue over the past weekend , including an estimated $ 1.75 million in sales tax revenue and $ 150,000 in withholding taxes due to the evacuation of @entity262 , according to @entity255 comptroller @entity263			0
officials estimated a $ 60,000 loss in gas tax revenue because of canceled weekend trips , and a loss of roughly $ 45,000 in toll revenue from the @entity270			0
additionally , @entity262 lost nearly $ 40,000 of admissions and amusement tax revenue from its many attractions and events but @entity263 did not question the decision to evacuate the town			0
" given the disastrous impact of this storm on other parts of our country ... am profoundly grateful that @entity262 and the state of @entity255 as a whole weathered this storm with minimal injury or loss of life , " he said in a statement			1
@entity0 's @entity289 , @entity290 , @entity291 and @entity292 and @entity294 's @entity293 and @entity295 contributed to this report .			0
