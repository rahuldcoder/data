an @entity1 judge has dismissed a criminal complaint accusing president @entity4 and other top leaders of covering up @entity7 's involvement in a 1994 terrorist bombing in @entity9			1
the prosecutor who filed the case , @entity12 , was found dead days after making the accusations			1
his death sparked outrage and conspiracy theories aplenty			0
judge @entity17 on thursday ruled that @entity12 's case did not meet the minimum threshold to initiate a criminal investigation			1
the government has denied the accusations from the beginning , and even some journalists who have pored through @entity12 's report have said the case was n't airtight			2
the 63 - page ruling states that " it is clear that neither of the two hypotheses of crimes made by the prosecutor in his complaint minimally hold up			2
" @entity12 alleged that @entity1 's government agreed not to go after @entity7 suspects in the bombing in exchange for a favorable trade deal			1
the two hypotheses that the judge referred to in his ruling were some of the key arguments made by @entity12			0
the prosecutor argued that the @entity1 government 's decision in 2013 to form a joint " truth commission " with @entity7 to investigate the bombing would hinder an honest examination			1
the 1994 bombing of a @entity51 in the @entity1 capital is the deadliest terror attack in the country 's history			2
eighty - five people were killed , and hundreds were injured			0
@entity12 also alleged that @entity58 and foreign minister @entity59 sought to withdraw from @entity60 their requests for the arrests of several @entity7 suspects			0
the judge ruled that because the truth commission has never been created , it ca n't have functioned as an instrument to cover up anything			0
regarding @entity60 , the judge said there is no evidence that the @entity1 government took steps to have the international police body remove the so - called red notices against the @entity7			1
addressing the accusation against @entity58 , the judge wrote that " there is not one piece of evidence , not even a hint , that points to the current president regarding the instigating or planning of the grave crime of a cover - up			1
... " @entity12 was found with a gunshot wound to his head in his apartment on january 18 , a day before he was scheduled to testify before lawmakers about his accusations			0
authorities have yet to determine if his death was a suicide or a homicide			0
earlier this month , a new prosecutor who picked up @entity12 's case said there was enough evidence to continue the criminal investigation			1
prosecutor @entity101 filed a 61 - page report essentially endorsing @entity12 's allegations			2
thursday 's ruling quashed his request for the investigation to proceed			0
@entity2 's @entity107 contributed to this report .			0
