@entity0 -- a third day of testimony gets underway in a @entity0 courtroom thursday as a judge decides whether dr. @entity5 will face trial for involuntary manslaughter in the death of singer @entity9			1
on wednesday , a paramedic and a security guard testified that @entity9 appeared to be dead when an ambulance arrived at his home at 12:26 p.m. june 25 , 2009			1
" when i picked him up , his legs were quite cool , " @entity15 paramedic @entity14 said			0
" his eyes were quite dry			0
" no pulse was detected , and the paramedics ' heart monitor showed @entity9 was " flatlined " as he lay on his bedroom floor , @entity14 testified			1
prosecutors contend that @entity5 's should be held criminally responsible for giving the pop star a surgical anesthetic , propofol , at home without monitoring equipment			1
the coroner concluded @entity9 died from " acute propofol intoxication , " in combination " the contributory affects of the benzodiazepines , " @entity15 deputy district attorney @entity28 said			1
@entity5 allegedly delayed calling for help when he found @entity9 was not breathing , misled paramedics and doctors about the series of sedatives and the anesthetic he 'd given him and that he tried to hide evidence when he should have been trying to revive @entity9			1
@entity5 told paramedics he had only given @entity9 a dose of lorazepam to help him sleep and that he was treating him for dehydration , @entity14 testified			1
when he asked " how long the patient was down , " the doctor responded " ' it just happened , ' " @entity14 testified			0
the paramedic said that account " it did n't add up			0
" testimony wednesday also included emotional accounts of crying and praying in the home as @entity9 's children and employees realized something was very wrong upstairs			2
@entity9 chef @entity56 said the first indication of a crisis was when @entity5 ran downstairs in a panic and asked her to send @entity9 's oldest son , @entity61 , and the security guard upstairs			1
" his eyes were enlarged , " @entity63 testified			0
" after the housekeepers started crying , the rest of the staff joined them , she said			0
" we started praying , " @entity63 said			0
" we held hands , and we were crying			0
" @entity9 's two oldest children , @entity61 and @entity72 , watched from a bedroom doorway as @entity5 tried to revive their father before the ambulance arrived , according to @entity76 , who worked on @entity9 's security team			1
" @entity72 screamed ' @entity78 ! ' and she started crying , " @entity76 testified			2
@entity9 's three sisters , parents and brother @entity82 listened from the second row of the courtroom as @entity76 appeared to be near tears as he described the scene			1
" dr. @entity5 then said ' get them out , get them out			1
do n't let them see their father like this , ' " @entity76 said			0
" i turned to the children and i told them ' do n't worry , children , we 'll take care of it			0
' " @entity76 testified that @entity5 asked for his help in collecting medicines from around the bedroom			2
" he then grabbed a handful of bottles or vials , " @entity76 said			0
" he instructed me to put them in a bag			0
" it was only then , about 21 minutes after prosecutors say @entity5 realized @entity9 was not breathing , that he asked @entity76 to call for an ambulance			1
it arrived four minutes later			2
@entity9 's former security chief testified that @entity5 seemed not to know how to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation as he waited for paramedics to arrive at the singer 's house			1
@entity114 said he and @entity76 saw @entity5 crouched next to @entity9 's bed " in a panicked state asking , ' does anyone know cpr ? ' " " i looked at @entity76 because we knew dr. @entity5 was a heart surgeon , so we were shocked , " @entity114 said			1
when defense lawyer @entity122 asked if perhaps @entity5 was only asking for help because he was tired , @entity114 said , " the way that he asked it is as if he did n't know cpr			2
" @entity76 testified that @entity5 told him and @entity114 that he was inexperienced at mouth - to - mouth resuscitation			2
" after the second time , he gave a breath , he said ' you know , this is the first time that i give mouth - to - mouth , but i have to do it , because he 's my friend , ' " @entity76 said			0
@entity9 appeared to be dead at that time , with his " eyes open and his mouth open , just laying there , " @entity114 said			1
@entity28 , the deputy district attorney , earlier said that @entity5 used " ineffectual cpr with one hand while the patient was prone on a soft bed			2
" using two hands with the patient prone on a hard surface is the proper method , he said			0
@entity114 , testifying tuesday , said he never saw @entity5 performing cpr on @entity9 before paramedics arrived and transported the singer to @entity146			1
the hearing , which began tuesday , is expected to last two or three weeks , with 20 to 30 witnesses testifying			0

@entity5 remains free on $ 75,000 bond			0
