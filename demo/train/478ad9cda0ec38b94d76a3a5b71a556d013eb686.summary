-- three brothers recuperated thursday afternoon in a once - open field now speckled by the bright blue tarps of a cholera rehydration clinic in the @entity6 town of @entity7 , where an outbreak has sickened hundreds of people			1
a cousin brought the young boys to the clinic , set up by @entity13 , said @entity14 , a spokeswoman for the @entity16 charity			2
they plopped down on cots , drained by severe diarrhea and vomiting			2
what they did not know yet was that the night before , their father had frantically tried to find a motorcycle so he could bring in their mother for treatment			2
he could not find one in time			2
so while the boys were regaining their strength with the help of an intravenous drip , their father was making funeral arrangements for their mother			2
they had survived the earthquake , but this family was ripped apart by a disease that is now feared to be spreading rapidly			2
the death toll in @entity6 's cholera outbreak climbed friday to 796 people , according to @entity6 's @entity41 and @entity42			1
another 12,303 people have fallen sick with the intestinal infection			0
epidemiologists predict the outbreak could last for months and say the entire nation of almost 10 million people is at risk because they have no immunity to cholera			1
the @entity52 warned that @entity6 is facing one of the most severe outbreaks of the disease in the past 100 years			1
it appealed to international donors for almost $ 164 million in response money			1
of grave concern now are four confirmed cases that originated in the tent cities of @entity62 , camps that sprang up to shelter those left homeless by the earthquake last january			0
health officials fear that infection could spread quickly in congested , unsanitary conditions and in impoverished neighborhoods where clean drinking water is at a premium			0
symptoms of cholera , an acute , diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine , can be mild or even nonexistent			1
but sometimes they can be severe -- profuse watery diarrhea , vomiting and leg cramps , which can cause rapid loss of body fluids and lead to dehydration and shock			0
if left untreated , a person can die within hours			0
aid workers like those of the @entity87 have been going tent to tent in @entity6 's makeshift camps , telling people of the importance of drinking clean water and outlining practices that can help avoid contamination			1
spokeswoman @entity96 said @entity87 workers also have been handing out bars of soap			0
" wash between your fingers , " they tell the camp residents			0
" do n't dry your hand with a dirty towel			0
" " we find among many people there is very little understanding on how you prevent it , " @entity105 said			0
people are anxious , she said , as the death curve has crept steadily higher and the health minister has proclaimed the cholera crisis a matter of national security			1
" @entity6 has had more than its share of bad luck , " @entity105 said			1
" this is another crisis that this country does not need			0
" complicating matters is the fact that @entity6 has not seen cholera in more than 50 years -- it 's yet another unfamiliar hardship for citizens and medical personnel			1
also , the country 's public health system , already strained before the earthquake , was virtually wiped out after january 12 , according to the @entity52			1
" now you have the prospect of tens of thousands of cholera patients streaming into the system , " @entity105 said			1
" that will be difficult			0
" aid agencies already working on the island to help quake survivors have rushed to set up cholera treatment centers			1
@entity142 ( @entity142 ) was erecting another 320 - bed facility in the @entity145 neighborhood			0
@entity13 planned to enlarge its clinic in @entity7 -- about an hour 's drive north of the capital -- to 100 beds by thursday night			0
@entity14 said the group was anticipating a need in nearby cabaret as well			0
in the meantime , the government has been telling people not to panic ; only to remain vigilant			0
and health workers have been spreading this word through cell phone texts , pamphlets and loudspeakers : @entity161 is key			1
on @entity164 in @entity165 , @entity14 's team looked more like political candidates than medical personnel when they passed through in their white " tap - tap " truck with large speakers mounted on top , she said			0
crowds of people rushed to get a cholera flier , as though it were money			1
the important thing , @entity14 said , is that the word is getting out on how to stay alive .			2

new : @entity6 cholera death toll rises to 796 , more than 12,000 sickened
aid agencies are *scrambling* to get the word out on prevention
they are setting up rehydration clinics
the @entity52 is asking for $ 164 million in response money
