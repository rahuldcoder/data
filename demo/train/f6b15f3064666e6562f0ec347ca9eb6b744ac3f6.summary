-- a cat and mouse game is being played out in @entity3 involving @entity4 , @entity3 's best known anti-corruption campaigner			1
its consequences could cast a shadow over the future of the @entity10 regime			1
@entity4 , who has announced his candidacy for mayor of @entity13 , achieved prominence by producing a blog that provided detailed reports on the corruption of @entity3 state - run companies , including the theft of $ 4 billion by executives from @entity22 , the state - owned pipeline company			1
what 's behind @entity4 's conviction ? when massive protests broke out after the falsified december 4 , 2011 , parliamentary elections , @entity4 emerged as one of its leaders and in the eyes of many , a future @entity3 presidential candidate			1
all this seemingly came to an end when @entity4 was sentenced to five years in a labor camp on july 18 after being convicted of misappropriating roughly $ 500,000 worth of state - owned timber while he served as an adviser to the governor of the @entity38			2
before the trial , @entity4 predicted his conviction			2
" they did n't fabricate this case in order to allow an ( acquittal ) , " he said			0
the day after the conviction , however , the state prosecutor stunned observers by requesting that @entity4 be freed on bail so he could continue to campaign for mayor of @entity13			2
@entity4 is now free to campaign against @entity49 , the @entity50 - backed candidate , who has 73 % of support in the opinion polls			2
opinion : @entity10 , a hypocrite on @entity55 , @entity4 this seeming act of generosity , however , may have a hidden motive			1
elections in @entity3 do not resemble elections in the @entity61			2
the core of a victorious candidate 's support is generally passive voters who are threatened at their place of work , bribed with small gifts or favors or bussed to the polling places where they can vote under the watchful eyes of their supervisors			0
it is this system that accounts for the electoral " success " of @entity3 president @entity10 in the 2012 elections and that of the @entity78 ( described by @entity4 as the " party of swindlers and crooks " ) in the last parliamentary elections			1
the system suffers from one defect : the results lack legitimacy			0
for this reason , the authorities may actually want @entity4 to campaign against @entity89			2
his principal accusation against the regime is that it is corrupt			0
but it will be more difficult to make that argument now that he himself has been convicted of corruption , however unfairly			0
if , despite all calculations , @entity4 begins to pose an electoral threat , a higher court can uphold @entity4 's conviction at any time and he can be jailed and his candidacy terminated			1
almost from the beginning of the @entity10 era , the regime has responded to opposition by accusing its opponents of corruption			1
@entity109 , the former head of the @entity111 oil company , was convicted of tax evasion and fraud after he used his wealth to finance opposition political parties			0
@entity117 , a @entity3 lawyer who exposed the theft of $ 230 million in a tax fraud scheme by high officials , was tortured to death in prison and then , in an almost unprecedented move , was found guilty of tax evasion posthumously			2
the cat and mouse game with @entity4 is part of this tradition			1
but it may not be enough to save the regime from the anger of the people			0
in @entity3 , the corruption market is valued by the @entity133 think tank at more than $ 300 billion annually , or more than a quarter of the gdp			1
@entity3 pay bribes to obtain contracts , to get licenses and permissions , to avoid inspections , to get medical treatment or get their children into universities			0
moreover , the chain of corruption rises to the very top			0
it has been credibly reported that @entity10 has a personal fortune of more than $ 40 billion and that he and his closest cronies control 10 % to 15 % of the @entity3 gross national product			1
under these circumstances , the regime may be sitting on a time bomb			0
according to a report cited by the @entity155 , 34 % of @entity3 " always " wish they could shoot bribe takers			0
another 38 % " sometimes " wish they could do so			0
in @entity13 , the number of people who are disgusted with bribe takers is even higher			0
two - thirds of @entity13 would gun them down			0
the @entity3 leaders periodically announce drives against corruption and may even arrest a few of their own officials in order to convince the population that they are taking action			2
the reality , however , is that corruption is integral to the @entity10 system in which loyalty is rewarded with the freedom to steal , ostensibly private businesses prosper only because they have connections to officials and are therefore , in effect , state - protected monopolies and the system of justice is totally subordinate to the economic interests of the highest ranking state officials			1
. independent reformers like @entity4 pose a serious threat to this system , which is why they have to be persecuted			1
but the failure to reform the system means its inner contradictions will only grow , setting the stage for a deeper crisis in the years ahead			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			0
