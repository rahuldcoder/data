-- when it comes to thinking about affirmative action , there 's an old way and a new way			1
the old way was in full bloom this week at the @entity8 , in a blistering 58 - page dissenting opinion by justice @entity10 in what was a state 's rights case involving a 2006 @entity14 law banning the use of racial criteria in publicly funded college and university admissions , and the question of whether these matters can be settled not just by courts but also by voters			1
the new way is on display in @entity24 , where lawmakers who want to amend the state constitution to reinstate racial and ethnic preferences at public colleges and universities -- something that was banned by a 1996 ballot initiative -- have a formidable opponent in the form of a group that knows a little something about discrimination : @entity37			1
under the old way of thinking , the narrative goes like this : there was once in this country ugly , overt and systematic discrimination based on race or ethnicity			2
african - americans in the @entity47 and @entity48 in the @entity49 were excluded not just from barbershops , country clubs and public swimming pools , but also from places that could change the destinies of individuals and uplift families -- colleges and universities			0
there had to be a corrective device , the thinking went , by which these institutions that had previously treated race and ethnicity of certain groups as a negative could flip the script and treat it as a positive			2
some people saw it as a reparation , a historical payoff			0
but it was more of an acknowledgment that discrimination leaves behind vestiges , and institutions that once went out of their way to be unwelcoming to certain groups now had to go out of their way to be welcoming to those groups by taking applicants ' race and ethnicity into account			0
this is how @entity10 , a graduate of @entity87 and @entity88 , sees the program that she has often credited for opening those doors			0
in her dissent in the @entity14 case , part of which she read aloud to her colleagues , the nation 's first @entity92 justice wrote : " this refusal to accept the stark reality that race matters is regrettable			2
the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to speak openly and candidly on the subject of race , and to apply the @entity108 with eyes open to the unfortunate effects of centuries of racial discrimination			2
as members of the judiciary tasked with intervening to carry out the guarantee of equal protection , we ought not sit back and wish away , rather than confront , the racial inequality that exists in our society			0
" anyone out there support racial inequality and think it ought to be preserved ? i did n't think so			0
besides , this case was n't about whether racial and ethnic preferences are good or bad , but whether their use could be restricted by voters at the state level			0
by a vote of 6 - to - 2 , the high court ruled that it could be			0
meanwhile , in @entity24 , there is a group that -- like @entity10 -- really dislikes racial inequality			1
so much so that they do n't think it ought to be reinstated by the state legislature under the pretext of expanding educational opportunity			0
in @entity141 or @entity142 or @entity143 , the dominant racial storyline is black - and - white			0
but in @entity24 , the most interesting relationship -- the one that will help define the future of the nation 's most populous state -- is the relationship between @entity151 and @entity37			1
at 38 % of the population , @entity151 now make up a plurality in @entity24			1
yet the fastest - growing minority in the state is @entity37 , who now make up nearly 14 % of @entity24 , or more than twice the number of african - americans			1
and just as @entity151 are divided on issues such as immigration and bilingual education , so , too , are there differences of opinion among @entity37 when the conversation turns to affirmative action			1
still , what sends shock waves through the debate in @entity24 is that one of the most prominent subsets -- @entity172 - @entity158 -- is opposed to the idea of colleges and universities taking into account race and ethnicity			1
organizations representing that constituency pressured a small group of @entity37 lawmakers to stall the legislation			2
you might think that an ethnic group that holds nearly 40 % of seats in the @entity188 system would have little to complain about			0
@entity37 - @entity158 organizations that oppose racial and ethnic preferences claim that the 40 % figure could soar to 50 % or 60 % if colleges and universities awarded slots based on merit			1
they insist that there is a quota to keep the @entity37 students below 50 % , and that this primarily benefits white students who might not be able to compete head - to - head with @entity37			2
welcome to affirmative action , @entity24 - style , where things get complicated			1
as the debate plays out in this state , you do n't hear much about " reparations " or the " vestiges of discrimination			2
" the dominant themes are " merit " and " fairness			0
" those are not small things			0
let 's put to rest the old way of thinking about affirmative action and confront the new challenges that lie ahead in a country that , with every passing day , resembles less and less what it used to be .			1

@entity223 : there 's an old and new way of thinking about affirmative action
@entity223 : some think use of racial criteria in college admission helps minorities
but @entity37 , a powerful minority in @entity24 , oppose affirmative action
@entity223 : the debate in @entity24 is not about " reparations , " but rather " merit "
