but unlike the @entity13 on saturday , @entity11 rallied and kept their slim @entity14 hopes alive by downing @entity12 3 - 2 with a dramatic injury - time winner at @entity16			1

" it was n't silky , it was n't fantastic flowing football , but it was effective			0
we have quality players and when we fight and work for each other , then the quality players show what they can do			0
" @entity12 possesses quality players , too , with the @entity6 trio of @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 all impressing this season and hoping to be on the plane to @entity63 for the @entity64			1
@entity60 's good finish after a @entity67 mistake made it 1 - 0 in the 19th minute and the right back 's error also led to @entity59 setting up @entity58 in the 28th			1
@entity72 began the comeback in the 31st minute before adding a second in the 46th , just minutes after @entity21 's halftime talk			0
@entity18 , a substitute , settled the affair when it appeared as if the points would be shared			2
