-- this election should have been a walkover for the @entity3			0
the economy is sluggish and the @entity5 is beset with crises abroad			2
yet , @entity7 has committed one gaffe after another , almost as if he actually wants to lose			1
perhaps the multi-millionaire has decided that the @entity11 is too small for him			0
on monday night , @entity7 was hit with what we might call a " pre-gaffe " when a private statement that he made months ago suddenly hit the @entity15			1
the video shows @entity7 apparently dismissing the 47 % of @entity5 who he says do n't pay federal income taxes as freeloaders			1
for someone who is often portrayed as cynical and uncaring , this is not good news			0
what will we see next ? leaked footage of @entity7 stealing candy from a baby ? there 's cause for @entity3 to panic			1
some commentators are starting to ask , " did @entity7 just lose the election ? " when i first saw the " 47 % " video , i wrote that it had to damage @entity7 's already poor likeability ratings and maybe even cost him the @entity11			1
but , after a couple of days of reflection , i think there 's still reason for @entity3 to have hope			1
not least because the polls point to a closer election than the headlines do			2
but i 'll come to that in a moment			0
first , it 's helpful to put the " 47 % " speech into historical perspective , which suggests that " gaffes never matter			1
" every campaign has a moment when the candidate says something they should n't have , and it is n't necessarily the end of the road			2
opinion : @entity7 better off as a @entity59 ? in april 2008 , in the middle of his primary race against @entity63 , @entity60 gave a speech in which he said that poverty caused " bitter " people to " cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who are n't like them			1
" his opponents went wild , but this kind of " cat out of the bag " statement tends to matter far more to fervent activists than it does to ordinary voters			2
after all , @entity60 won the primary and the general election			0
four years later , it 's only @entity3 activists who still say they are " proud to be clinging to my guns and religion " -- as if the statement has any contemporary relevance			2
in 2016 , @entity89 activists will probably be driving around with faded bumper stickers that read , " 47 percent -- and proud ! " the rest of us will have long forgotten what that means			0
over time , sober analysis might slowly turn in @entity7 's favor , too			1
consider how @entity60 's words were taken out of context			0
he was really making a case for why liberals had to renew their efforts to improve people 's finances , " to get people persuaded that we can make progress when there 's not evidence of that in their daily lives			0
" likewise , @entity7 was actually arguing that there was no point pitching his low tax policy to the 47 % of @entity5 who already do n't pay income taxes because ... they do n't pay taxes			1
what he meant by " i do n't have to worry about them , " was that he did n't need to court their vote			0
he was n't saying that if he saw them begging in the street he 'd drive his limo straight on by			0
in fact , the " 47 % " speech reads a lot better on the page than it sounds on the video			0
part of @entity7 's problem is n't the content of his ideas , but the ubiquitous context of wealth and power			1
his host was a one - percenter with a taste for extravagant parties , and @entity7 delivered his line as if sharing the inner workings of a ponzi scheme			1
despite @entity7 's personality problem , he is n't doing nearly as badly in the polls as the punditry suggests			1
in fact , the day after the 47 % video leaked , @entity144 released a poll that showed the president only 1 percentage point ahead of the @entity3 challenger			0
ironically , the pollster also reported that he has surprising support among people with low incomes			0
this would seem to prove that @entity60 's convention bounce was only temporary and that he remains vulnerable			1
more importantly , the public has n't punished @entity7 for a serious gaffe he made over @entity159			1
critics accused him of jumping the gun when he lambasted a statement released by the @entity163 in @entity164 condemning a film considered offensive to @entity166 -- protests against which later resulted in the death of four @entity5 in @entity170			0
if they 're prepared to forgive him for that snafu , perhaps they 'll ignore this one , too			0
take a look at the electoral map and you 'll see that @entity60 has momentum in the swing states			0
according to @entity180 ' average of polls , he 's ahead 4.2 percentage points in @entity183 , 3 points in @entity189 , 2.7 points in @entity185 , and 1.4 points in @entity187			2
that puts @entity7 well within striking distance and that 's even before he 's had a chance to land some punches in the debates			1
opinion : how @entity7 really feels about @entity3 never underestimate the power of events or the flexibility of polls			1
we do n't know what 's going to happen between now and november , and the recent crises in the @entity204 show how unsettled things are			1
around this point in 1980 , @entity206 was running even with @entity208			0
things changed then ; things can change now			0
ultimately , @entity7 still has an advantage when it comes to the grand narrative of this campaign			2
a lot of the 2012 election has been about character and culture -- which candidate do you like best and where do they stand on same - sex marriage or abortion			0
but voters consistently tell pollsters that the issue they really care about is the economy			2
as long as they actually vote on that matter -- and as long as unemployment remains high -- @entity7 is in with a chance			1
republicans should n't give up hope just yet			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity236 .			2

@entity238 : @entity7 's *secretly* taped remarks hurt his cause but are n't fatal
he says @entity7 may find , like other politicians , that gaffes often do n't stick
polls in recent days show the race remains close , @entity236 says
@entity236 : voters remain focused mostly on the economy , and that could be a @entity7 *strength*
