-- if , as the popular saying goes , the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result , the people who run our public schools fit that description			1
for several generations now , schools have been failing students the same ways over and over and expecting a different result			1
teachers lecture , students sit and some listen			1
class happens at the same time , with the same material , and at the same pace for everyone			2
this is an 1890s model of education -- teaching to the " average " student , rather than the individual			0
in an age when most information and knowledge is transmitted digitally and is increasingly personalized — think about how @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 work — we should be able to do much better than that			0
pioneering projects like @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 are pointing toward a future of learning that is more like @entity29 than the chalk - and - textbook system we have today			1
each of them is using technology to help students learn at their own pace , on their own path , and toward their own goals			1
as @entity37 founder @entity52 told me in an interview for my book " breakout , " " i think we found the magic formula			0
that may sound pretentious , but the magic formula for me is high - quality education at scale			0
i think we owe students a personalized , high - quality experience			0
" new resources like @entity36 have enabled creative teachers to integrate digital learning into the classroom and to coach students to offer better , more personalized instruction			1
this " blended learning " — having some teaching done by a teacher and some through digital learning systems — is a revolutionary concept that when effectively implemented has led to impressive learning gains , especially among students who have traditionally underperformed			1
now this model is getting a boost from a forward - thinking leader in @entity78			0
this week , @entity80 conference chairwoman @entity81 , @entity82 , introduced legislation to set up five state pilot programs to implement this new instructional method her idea is to harness the extraordinary progress that charter schools , along with other innovative public and catholic schools , have had by combining teachers with personalized digital learning systems			1
to acquire technology and train teachers often requires an up - front investment			1
@entity96 ' bill pledges $ 25 million to states in the form of block grants to set up this program			1
and unlike most federal spending proposals , these grants actually are investments that pay off over time			0
the long - term cost of educating students , which has been rising exponentially since the 1960s , declines dramatically under blended learning			1
taxpayers and students win with a little help from innovation			0
this model works precisely because it asks much of teachers and their students			1
students ' skills are assessed daily or weekly through interactive systems like @entity36 ( which you can try here ; it 's completely free )			1
future lessons are tailored to fit their needs			0
then teachers , armed with detailed data about each student , can lead small group and one - on - one sessions to help clear up problems			1
if , for example , @entity130 is having trouble grasping fractions , a teacher would be able to identify her difficulty , often that same day , and intervene to make sure she does n't get left behind			0
under the traditional model of education , students who are having trouble often pass from lesson to lesson , falling further and further behind until the teacher has the time to review the entire class ' progress			0
by then , @entity130 has probably become frustrated and tuned out			0
in the case of subjects like math that build upon previous lessons , this phenomenon can be devastating			0
students can fall entire grade levels behind before anyone notices they have missed basic concepts that are impeding their progress			0
educators with online tools , on the other hand , can usually accelerate the pace of instruction			0
in some cases , students skip whole grade levels while using blended learning			1
the results of this method of teaching have been astounding , especially in charter schools that have adopted it early , like @entity169 in @entity170			1
nestled in an impoverished neighborhood where most students receive free or reduced lunch ( a proxy for poverty ) , @entity169 has adopted blended learning and has seen progress that was once unthinkable			2
it recently scored an amazing 991 ( out of 1,000 possible points ) on the @entity178			0
that makes @entity169 empower the top - performing school in @entity181 and one of the best in the state of @entity185			0
traditional public schools have also benefited from this model			1
@entity188 partnered with the @entity189 to set up a similar program in a handful of inner - city schools in that district			2
the results are far fewer discipline problems and much better scores			0
at one of the pilot schools , the number of students reading at grade level actually doubled			2
promising blended learning programs are underway in settings as wide - ranging as @entity204 , @entity206 's @entity205 , and @entity207 , @entity208 , according to the @entity210 's @entity209			2
in addition to these achievement gains , blended learning is also proving to be more cost - effective for taxpayers than the traditional model			2
the cost of educating each student declines in blended - learning environments , in part because schools require fewer teachers to manage the classrooms			1
with fewer discipline issues , students become more engaged in the material and as a result , learn better			2
additionally , teachers have more free time to spend with each student			2
this makes classroom size rules obsolete , and since compensating teachers has been the main cost driver in education , it is a big breakthrough			2
contact your member of @entity78 today and voice support for rep. @entity96 ' bill to help more schools start blended learning pilot programs			1
it 's time our education system enters the 21st century			0

@entity246 : public schools are stuck in an outmoded chalk and textbook era
he says a new bill encourages *experimentation* with learning blending teachers , *computers*
@entity257 : organizations such as the @entity36 offer a new way to learn
