-- i 'd already run about half the marathon when the next refreshment table came into view			1
thirsty and needing to stay charged for the next 13 miles , i elbowed my way through the crowds of runners and grabbed my drink of choice			1
a nice glass of full - bodied red wine			1
this is how it rolls at the @entity14 , an annual festival of wine and running near @entity17 , @entity18 , in which competitors strive to complete 26 miles and almost as many glasses of the local vin			1
now in its 30th edition , the race is something of a legend for marathon runners			1
last year i was among 3,300 runners from 53 different nations -- @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 -- joining 5,200 competitors from across @entity18			1
sure , there are prestige races in @entity35 , @entity36 , and @entity37 , but the gustatory element is lacking			0
even the @entity40 marathon fails to offer much more than bananas and water			1
instead , this marathon weaves through scenic vineyards in the @entity14 region , starting in the town of @entity47 , where some of the best @entity17 wines are produced			0
the run has a time limit of six hours and 30 minutes and is nicknamed " the longest marathon in the world " with little exaggeration			2
in 2013 , only about 1,100 runners finished under four hours and thirty minutes -- the other 7,400 were in no rush , if they finished at all			2
hairy body suits to compare , the 2013 @entity40 marathon had an average speed of four hours and 10 minutes			0
as if it 's not enough that we 're all drinking , the marathon is themed each year , with nearly every participant dressed in costumes			2
last year 's theme , " sci - fi , " saw runners dressed as aliens , " @entity71 " characters and a few daring @entity69 in full hairy body suits			1
for this year 's race on september 13 , 2014 , 10,000 competitors are expected to dress to the theme of " carnival around the world			1
" increasingly popular , places are hard to come by and many entrants race it competitively to win prizes of -- yep -- wine			2
while the @entity83 has n't resorted to operating the lottery entry systems recently adopted by the @entity37 and @entity40 marathons , competitors now face an online scramble to sign up during several registration waves scheduled by organizers			1
with more runners than ever expected , locals in @entity47 are getting ready for the 2014 event			2
organizers , too , are bracing themselves , preparing more medical care and water stops than typical marathon events to help runners through the stresses and strains of long - distance drinking			1
competitors , meanwhile , are likely putting in last - minute training -- early morning runs and extended evenings at their local bars			2
@entity106 national @entity105 , a @entity107 connoisseur , will run it for the third time this year			1
" there are people from all over the globe running this marathon but somehow at that race we all speak the same language , " she says , " and it 's not only the wine talking			2
" marathoner @entity119 , 42 years old from @entity120 , is hoping the race will bring the fun back to running , but is hesitant about the unique refreshments			0
" wine , food along the course would be hard to resist and i have no idea how my body will react , " he says			0
dance break back on the road during my attempt , jogging from chateau to chateau through the vineyards , most of the other marathoners were staying hydrated as i was , tastings each property 's wares			0
it 's not every day the @entity141 family opens up its chateau to thousands of sweaty runners , but there we were , stretching our calves , glasses in hand			1
the runner 's high mixed with slight inebriation and at about the 22 - mile mark there was what seemed to be an obligatory dance break as we neared the home stretch			0
in a bit of pain but eager to complete the last few miles , we guzzled bits of steak , ice cream and oysters with white wine ( never red with oysters -- we 're not animals )			1
my belly full and my mind slightly adrift , i crossed the finish line with the rest of the pack , ready for a good stretch and nap			0
my time of six hours and nine minutes was n't going to break any records , but i thoroughly enjoyed every glass of wine offered along the way			0
i was n't the only one			0
@entity179 traveled from @entity180 to do the marathon in 2013 -- her first ever despite a distaste for running			0
she donned a space cowboy suit , complete with antenna sticking out of a cowboy hat and silver body paint for the race			0
" i 've watch other marathons where friends have run and everyone looks so miserable , checking their watches , " @entity179 said			0
" this event was a joyous 26.2 mile block party			0

held annually in *southeastern* @entity18 , the @entity83 pits runners against 26.2 miles and many glasses of wine
last year 3,300 runners from 53 different nations joined 5,200 competitors from across @entity18
organizers lay on extra water stations and medical *provisions* to help runners cope with the *rigors* of a boozy run
