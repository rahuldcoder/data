@entity0 -- in the wake of @entity5 's patent infringement victory over @entity6 , many are asking : " what are the practical implications and repercussions of the verdict ? " for now , the verdict should be viewed as a victory for consumers , industrial designers , design rights and the patent system in general			1
i recognize there are some who disagree with this position			0
these skeptics , painting a gloom and doom picture , argue that the decision will stifle innovation , yielding fewer product choices for consumers , and worse yet , leading to higher prices as @entity5 will levy an " @entity5 tax " on all electronic devices			2
they do n't stop there			0
they then grouse that a party should not be " forced " to change its product " just to avoid a patent			0
" the rhetoric then typically concludes with a flurry of complaints , which , if taken to their logical conclusion , are nothing short of a call to arms to abolish the entire patent system			2
lest we forget , the authority to grant patents is expressly engrained in the @entity48 @entity47			0
expect daring new designs to understand the epic patent dispute between @entity5 and @entity6 , one must appreciate that there were two distinct breeds of intellectual property rights at play in the case : utility patents and design patents			1
roughly speaking , utility patents protect the function of an item , while design patents protect the appearance of an item			0
design patents were at the core of this case			0
@entity5 's competitors , including @entity6 , will now need to steer clear of @entity5 's designs			1
they need to step beyond the shadow of @entity5 's designs ( where they have largely resided for years ) , and create products that are unique , appealing and distinctly different in visual appearance			1
the jury spoke loud and clear : design rights need to be respected			1
this verdict should be viewed as a much needed opportunity for @entity5 's competitors to " go back to the drawing board			1
" this , in turn , will mean consumers can expect new , exciting and even daring designs			0
thankfully , consumers will be spared a lifetime of watching @entity5 release new products only to have competitors react by seeing how close they can get without crossing the design line			1
it is entirely possible that consumers , in time , will get tired of the same - old @entity5 designs , and actually prefer the new creations			1
it then will be @entity5 who will need to innovate ( again )			0
this will keep prices in check			0
are @entity5 's competitors ready ? @entity5 's competitors are ready -- provided their decision - makers give the industrial designers ( the visual geniuses who create new product designs ) , more creative license			1
the best way to compete with @entity5 's designs is not to emulate but to out - design			1
across the globe , there are highly talented industrial designers bursting with creativity who are ready , willing and able to create new , exciting and different looking designs			0
@entity6 to fight ruling @entity6 already employs an accomplished industrial design squad that has received many design accolades , including at the prestigious 2012 @entity112 from the @entity113			2
during the course of the trial we learned @entity6 's business folk were calling most of the shots on product design , rather than its design professionals			2
@entity6 's all - star industrial design team will likely now retake the reins -- again , this bodes well for consumers			1
how did @entity5 do it ? @entity5 and @entity6 are prolific users of the @entity48 design patent system			1
in 2001 , @entity5 was issued ten @entity48 design patents while @entity6 was issued eight			1
this year , @entity5 is on pace for 160 @entity48 design patents , and @entity6 is tracking toward 500			1
with @entity5 's design patent rights carrying the day , the silver lining for @entity6 is that its investment in its large design patent portfolio has been fortified			1
but @entity6 brass may still be left scratching their heads as to how @entity5 scored this latest triumph			2
@entity5 ruling will hurt -- but not for long @entity5 's playbook for success in this case boils down to four things			1
firstly , the company has top - down understanding of the importance of design in the consumer 's purchasing decision			0
secondly , it has top - tier industrial design team who created appealing designs that drove product demand so much so they created an insatiable desire to emulate			2
thirdly , the company has a sophisticated and aggressive design patent acquisition program			0
finally , it has a desire to expend significant effort and resources to enforce and defend product design			0
it will be interesting to see which @entity5 competitors seek to emulate this strategy for success			2
for now this case will serve as an ordinary example of how our patent system was designed to work			2
@entity169 innovates and patents ; in response , @entity171 advances the arts and sciences beyond the efforts of @entity176 soon , @entity169 will be chasing @entity171 and so on and so forth			0
all along , the public is the beneficiary of the advancements and innovations			0
let the designing begin .			0
