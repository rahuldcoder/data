@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 - winning actor @entity3 wants a federal judge to stop dvd sales of a horror movie he filmed two years ago because he 's still owed $ 640,000 by the producers			1
" @entity13 , " filmed in @entity14 , never made it to the theaters , but dvd sales begin tuesday , according to the lawsuit @entity3 filed last week			1
a lawyer for @entity16 , one of the defendants , said the dvd has been in rental stores since september 7 , something he said @entity3 's lawyer should already know			2
" he should have gone to @entity24 and picked it up , " defense lawyer @entity23 said			0
@entity3 , who won the best actor @entity4 for " @entity26 " in 2003 , has been paid $ 960,000 for his work , @entity23 said			1
he acknowledged that the @entity29 production company still owes the actor the rest of his $ 1.5 million fee			0
@entity3 's lawsuit claims he learned after the first week of filming in @entity14 that producers @entity35 and @entity37 had failed to deposit a portion of his fee into an escrow account as required in his contract			1
" in order to induce @entity3 not to walk off the set , as was his contractual right , @entity35 and @entity37 represented to @entity3 that they had new guaranteed funding lined up , and requested @entity47 to enter into a new superseding agreement , " the suit said			0
the new agreement " expressly granted the absolute right to withhold consent to the use of his likeness in the picture until he was paid the full amount of the $ 640,000 that he deferred , " the suit said			1
the fee has still not been paid and producers have ignored @entity3 's demands to withhold the movie , the suit said			1

@entity23 said @entity3 's lawyer has been " trying to bully people into paying " since march			2
@entity3 's agreement specified that the payment would come from the sale of the @entity14 distribution rights , @entity23 said			2
when that $ 2 million deal for that fell through , everyone lost money , he said			0
" he 's not the only one who did n't get his money , " @entity23 said .			0
