do you hate your cable company ? is that same company your internet provider ? or do you pay an outrageous sum for super slow web access over your phone line ? the announcement of yet another megamerger in the telecommunications industry -- this time @entity10 is proposing to buy @entity11 in a plan that would merge the country 's two largest cable providers -- highlights just how broken and misguided the @entity15 is when it comes to its vital internet infrastructure			1
@entity15 are divided on many issues , but resentment against these telecom giants is so pervasive that it may just be the most heartwarming symbol of national unity			1
and that 's as it should be			0
except that the resentment should extend to politicians who have made this disastrous system possible and allow political contributions to prevent them from fixing it			0
the problem is not just one of dismal customer service			0
instead , it is a growing threat to the country 's economic and strategic position			0
if you travel overseas , you will quickly notice that web access in much of the developed world is light years ahead of @entity15 's			1
you may also be irritated to discover that far better @entity39 is much , much cheaper in other countries			1
the average @entity15 spends thousands of dollars each year for @entity39 , phone and cable services			1
if you live in , say , @entity43 , @entity44 , your best " triple play " deal -- cable , @entity39 and phone -- comes courtesy of @entity10 at $ 121 per month , according to a study by the @entity51			1
that service limps into your house at a rate of 5 megabits per second ( @entity55 )			0
if you lived in @entity56 , @entity57 , you could buy the same three - service bundle blazing at 100 @entity55 -- 20 times faster -- for just $ 35			1
or you could pay just $ 15 a month for a modest 8 mbps , still a huge improvement in speed at a small fraction of the cost			2
how much do you pay ? does it feel like you 're being robbed ? the problem is that telecommunications services are coming from an ever - smaller number of companies with very little genuine competition			0
and the way the system is structured , those companies have practically no incentive to build a fast @entity39			1
why would @entity10 invest in fast fiber networks when it already controls most of the market ? in fact , if @entity10 provided faster internet service , it might jeopardize its own cable business by making alternatives such as @entity78 and @entity79 more appealing			1
already there are reports that @entity10 is trying to keep its competitor @entity78 in check			2
@entity84 , incidentally , started building a fiber optic network , @entity86			0
but it decided to stop expanding and focus on improving the profitability of the existing @entity86 ecosystem			0
why invest on fast @entity39 when you can mint money on mobile service , and when fast @entity39 makes services such as @entity94 more of threat ? what is good for the phone , cable and @entity39 companies is not good for @entity15			1
to open the country to the future , internet providers would need to build a network of fibers reaching into all our homes			2
fiber optic cables will make the internet so fast we can barely imagine it			0
to show us what we 're missing , and probably to prod us into action , @entity110 decided to build those networks in a handful of cities			0
@entity116 , growing in @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 , @entity121 , will clock at an astounding 1,000 mbps			0
that 's an incredible 200 times faster than the @entity43 example , and 100 times faster than the @entity15 average			2
in the past few years , i have experienced internet service that is cheaper and much faster in @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and other cities			1
@entity15 's internet is awful and awfully expensive			1
that means @entity15 waste precious time waiting for downloads to limp onto their screens			2
it also means @entity15 businesses are less efficient than they could be , and it means @entity15 's brilliant , creative technological minds and its entrepreneurs , who already gave the world the @entity39 and much of its wonders , are falling behind and will continue to fall even further			1
according to the @entity145 's @entity144 , the @entity15 ranks 35th in world internet bandwidth per user despite being ranked no. 1 in gross domestic product			1
countless reports have documented the embarrassing state of the country 's crawling internet network			0
adding insult to this electronic injury are the larcenous rates extracted by providers from @entity15 's mostly helpless consumers			1
check out @entity160 's quarterly state of the internet report , and you will discover that as bad as the situation is , it is only getting worse , particularly when it comes to top quality connection speeds			1
the world 's fastest average peak connection speeds , which requires bringing the internet over fiber lines , are found in @entity171 , @entity57 , @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174 , with peak speeds in the range of 47.7 mbps to 65 mbps			0
the @entity15 did not even make it into the top ten for the category			2
meanwhile , the @entity15 average connection speed was just 9.8 mbps , less than half that of @entity57			2
there are a number of possible solutions			0
in places where the @entity187 signal flies like an @entity189 luge over the ice , the government may have developed the infrastructure , but they can rent those fiber lines to private telecom firms that package the service for consumers			2
the fees can even bring profit to municipal coffers			0
some @entity15 cities are experimenting with the idea			2
but the telecom firms are generous and powerful lobbyists , poised to block competition and regulations			0
at this time of national political polarization , this is a ripe issue for new politicians hoping to bring change			0
my humble proposal is that brave new candidates tackle the problem loudly , embracing the common purpose of helping consumers while responding to an urgent national imperative			0
it is a problem that unites @entity15 across party lines , and those fed up with party lines , in their disdain for the companies that give them an inferior service at a ridiculous price			1
politicians who campaign -- and later govern -- with a clear plan to improve @entity15 's internet infrastructure will incur the wrath of wealthy corporations , but they will earn the admiration of voters .			1

@entity10 proposed to buy @entity11 for $ 45 billion
@entity235 : merging the two largest cable providers is bad for @entity15
she says @entity15 pay more for lower quality internet service ; other nations are ahead
@entity243 : @entity10 will have little incentive to improve our vital @entity39 infrastructure
