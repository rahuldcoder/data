-- as @entity2 thinks about his 35 - year prison sentence , he likely may be contemplating the availability of treatment for his gender identity disorder while in federal custody			1
prisoners with @entity9 are hardly a new phenomenon			2
many prisoners before @entity2 have legally sought the right to become the gender they believe they should be through various means : cross-gender hormones , cross-dressing , and sex - reassignment surgery			1
the question with prisoners becomes whether the state must provide the desired hormones or sex - reassignment surgery			2
the @entity22 has held that prisoners are entitled to medical care that meets minimal standards of adequacy			1
but when prison officials refuse to provide certain medical services , a prisoner must establish that state officials are deliberately indifferent to " serious medical needs " and therefore are in violation of the @entity34 's ban against " cruel and unusual punishment			1
" the application of the @entity34 to prisoners is a relatively new concept			2
the @entity22 first addressed the issue in 1976 , but in doing so established that deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes the " unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain , " which is covered by the @entity34 's proscription against cruel and unusual punishment			1
so what constitutes " serious medical needs " ? courts have held that these can be conditions diagnosed by a physician as requiring treatment			2
however , courts have also held that the prisoner need not receive " ideal care " or " the care of his choice			1
" instead , prison officials have some authority to choose among different treatments			2
the issue with @entity9 then becomes this : is it possible that the only appropriate medical treatment for patients ( prisoners and civilians alike ) with @entity9 is either hormone therapy , or , more drastically , sex - reassignment surgery ? generally , if a treatment is " medically necessary , " it will be provided to prisoners			1
several medical authorities have stated that in some cases , sex - reassignment surgery is a " medically necessary " treatment for some individuals with @entity9			0
medical authorities say that severe emotional distress is the result of untreated @entity9			0
that distress can lead to self - mutilation and possibly suicide			0
certainly some members of the public will ask the question : " is n't prison supposed to be unpleasant ? " even more ardent opponents might pose the hypothetical : " if medicine recognizes ' prison - a - phobia ' ( a fear of incarceration ) , and the only accepted treatment is release from prison , is an afflicted prisoner constitutionally entitled to release from prison , as medically necessary treatment to which he is entitled ? " one could also argue that such arguments stretch the logic to an absurd -- and inapplicable -- extreme			0
for prisoners who claim they are entitled to either surgery or hormone treatment under the @entity34 , the issue is even thornier : does a failure to provide cross-gender hormones or sex - reassignment surgery constitute deliberate indifference to a serious medical need ? if so , prisoners could be constitutionally entitled to either or both			1
in 2012 , a federal district court in @entity111 held , in a groundbreaking opinion , that prison officials violated the @entity34 by refusing to provide a prisoner sex - reassignment surgery			1
even more fascinating , in the same case , @entity116 v. @entity117 , the state was already providing feminizing hormones to the prisoner , but the court deemed this constitutionally inadequate treatment			1
how did the federal court arrive at this decision ? first , it reviewed medical literature , which provided that , in certain cases , sex - reassignment surgery is the only treatment for @entity9			1
that literature included the @entity134 's " @entity131 for the @entity132 , @entity133 , and @entity135			0
" those standards provide that in persons with profound @entity9 , " sex reassignment surgery ... is medically indicated and medically necessary			0
" the standards also provide that such surgery is not " elective " or " optional " in any meaningful sense			0
once the court established that medical necessity , there was little to prevent prisoner @entity143 ( formerly @entity144 ) @entity116 from making his case			1
the court concluded that @entity116 had a serious medical need ; that sex reassignment surgery was the only adequate treatment for it ; and that the @entity150 was aware of his " suffering serious harm ... if not provided such surgery			0
" by this logic , @entity116 successfully established an @entity34 violation , and the court ordered his sex - reassignment surgery " forthwith " -- legalese for " right away			0
" courts since @entity116 have arrived at different conclusions			0
@entity158 may ultimately reject this logic in the case of prisoners			2
for example , a prisoner with appendicitis would be entitled to a " medically necessary " appendectomy			0
why ? because the consequences of this appendicitis , left untreated , include a very real risk of death			0
there is no risk of death , or even serious bodily harm ( other than self - inflicted ) in the case of untreated @entity9			0
the benefits are largely mental , emotional , and / or spiritual , and that 's why it will be unpopular : most civilians may not consider the peace of mind of our nation 's incarcerated criminals -- at the cost of their tax dollars -- " medically necessary			0
" so what will @entity2 's options be ? will he be entitled to sexual hormone therapy , or sex - reassignment surgery ? will he have the right to have the federal government ( i.e. , taxpayers ) fund this treatment ? the answer will turn on whether federal courts will choose to follow the logic of the @entity197 court , and hold that the government 's refusal to allow and pay for sex - reassignment surgery for prisoners with @entity9 constitutes " cruel and unusual punishment			1
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .			2

@entity204 : @entity2 case may test **law** on gender identity **change** in prison
a federal court ruled that prisoners must be granted care for gender **change**
@entity204 : the test is whether denial of care amounts to " cruel and unusual punishment "
he says other courts have differed on the issue ; the **law** is not fully *settled*
