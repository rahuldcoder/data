-- fears of an imminent terrorist attack in @entity3 caused the @entity4 to order some @entity4 to leave the country on tuesday , while @entity6 pulled out its embassy staff amid continuing strife			1
a pair of suspected @entity4 drone strikes killed four @entity13 militants , and a bomb tossed into a mosque west of the capital , @entity17 , killed one person and injured 12 , police told the state news agency @entity19			1
the @entity4 security posture throughout the @entity21 , and especially in @entity3 , was heightened this week after officials intercepted a message from @entity13 leader @entity24 to a top ally in @entity3 telling him to " do something			1
" according to sources , the message was sent to @entity29 , the leader of @entity30 , who @entity4 intelligence believes was recently appointed the overall terror organization 's no. 2 leader			1
a convergence of developments -- the intercept and increased intelligence " chatter " indicating final planning for an attack ; a series of prison breaks linked to @entity13 that freed hundreds of convicted or suspected terrorists in @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 ; and the end of the @entity45 -- caused @entity4 officials to issue a worldwide travel alert and close embassies and consulates this week across @entity50 and the @entity21			1
tuesday 's withdrawal of non-emergency government personnel further escalated the security precautions			2
" in response to a request from the @entity64 , early this morning the @entity61 transported personnel out of @entity17 , @entity3 , " @entity59 spokesman @entity58 said in a statement			1
@entity0 's @entity66 was told that two military planes carrying as many as 90 @entity4 from @entity3 were enroute to @entity68 in @entity69			1
at the @entity64 , spokesperson @entity70 said tuesday that ordering out non-emergency personnel was in response to a " specific , immediate " threat that also caused other precautionary steps such as the extended closing of diplomatic facilities announced sunday			1
the @entity77 also announced tuesday that " all staff in the @entity79 " in @entity3 had been " temporarily withdrawn and the embassy will remain closed until staff are able to return			2
" it cited " increased security concerns " for the move			0
in @entity85 , the @entity3 @entity79 issued a statement criticizing the foreign withdrawals			2
" @entity3 has taken all necessary precautions to ensure the safety and security of foreign missions in the capital , " said the statement by @entity3 's foreign affairs ministry			2
" while the government of @entity3 appreciates foreign governments ' concern for the safety of their citizens , the evacuation of embassy staff serves the interests of the extremists and undermines the exceptional cooperation between @entity3 and the international alliance against terrorism			0
" @entity70 , however , said the decision to pull out non-emergency personnel " does n't have an impact " on the broader @entity4 relationship with the @entity3 government , noting that secretary of state @entity107 spoke monday night with @entity3 's president " to thank him for his efforts around this announcement			1
" security sources who told @entity0 about the latest drone strikes provided no additional details			1
a @entity3 official said four drone strikes have been carried out in the past 10 days			1
none of those killed in the two strikes on tuesday were among the 25 names on the country 's most - wanted list , security officials said			2
separately , @entity4 special forces units overseas have been on alert for the past several days awaiting a mission to attack potential @entity13 targets if those behind the most recent terror threats against @entity4 interests can be identified , a senior @entity129 administration official told @entity0			1
the official declined to identify the units or their locations because of the sensitive nature of the information			0
defense secretary @entity143 put the units on alert last week , the official said			0
according to the @entity147 and @entity64 , the substantial security steps reflect an " abundance of caution " over intelligence information that indicated final planning by @entity13 in @entity3 for possible terrorist attacks on @entity154 targets to coincide with the end of @entity156			1
on monday , @entity147 spokesman @entity157 told reporters that @entity4 anti-terrorism efforts had decimated @entity13 's global leadership and greatly diminished its core in @entity162 and @entity43 , saying the threat had " shifted to some of these affiliates , in particular @entity30			1
" ' do something ' the intercepted message among senior @entity13 operatives over the past several days further intensified concerns already heightened by increased terrorist chatter detected by intelligence agencies , as well as the prison breaks			2
@entity4 and @entity3 officials had already spent weeks watching a rising stream of intelligence about the possibility of a major terrorist attack in @entity3 , so the message from @entity24 to the @entity30 leader caused them to fear imminent terrorist action			1
along with the intercepted message , @entity4 officials cautioned there may be multiple sources of intelligence , including intercepts of electronic information from phone calls and web postings and the interrogation of couriers or other operatives			2
opinion : what 's behind timing of terror threat asked monday about the prison breaks , @entity64 spokeswoman @entity196 called them " a concern for the international community " that is " separate and apart " from the @entity4 concern about the latest specific terrorist threat			1
@entity0 national security analyst @entity203 , however , noted that @entity13 " actually announced a year ago that they were going to do this campaign of releasing prisoners from prison and they conducted something like seven prison assaults -- a couple of which have been quite successful			2
" prison breaks a senior official with @entity41 's interior ministry told @entity0 on condition of not being identified that top officials of @entity13 in @entity41 , including @entity218 , escaped from @entity207 during the jailbreak there last month and remains at large			2
@entity203 noted that a 2006 prison break in @entity17 led to the creation of @entity30 , one of the terrorist organization 's most virulent affiliates			0
although the prison breaks are not the main reason for the raised terror threat , said @entity229 analyst @entity228 , " it is part of the background music			0
" prison breaks can often strengthen terrorist groups because " some of these guys are likely to be seasoned operatives , " he added			0
to @entity0 national security contributor @entity237 , the timing of the prison breaks and increased intelligence chatter building up to the end of @entity156 signaled heightened @entity13 activity that required precautionary steps in response			1
she noted that in the run - up to the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , " the government failed to connect dots			0
" " these seem like dots that ought to be connected , " said @entity249 , a former homeland security and anti-terrorism adviser to the @entity253 administration			0
" you can figure out later whether or not you were right			0
" is rash of brazen prison breaks related ? @entity259 wants to know another dot she cited was that @entity24 recently appointed @entity29 to be the new general manager of the global @entity13 network			0
a high - profile attack orchestrated by @entity29 would cement the @entity3 's new position in the @entity13 hierarchy , @entity249 said			1
according to a @entity4 official with access to the latest intelligence , @entity29 's appointment as a top global @entity13 figure would almost certainly have required back - and - forth communication between @entity30 and @entity13 central			1
over the weekend , @entity259 warned that @entity13 has been tied to the prison breaks on july 23 in @entity41 , on july 26 in @entity42 and four days later in @entity43			0
end of @entity156 another factor prompting the embassy and consulate closures is the end of @entity156			0
depending on when a new crescent moon is seen , the @entity45 could end wednesday or thursday			0
@entity156 's end is celebrated with the @entity280 -- a three - day holiday in most @entity282 countries			0
the @entity64 , in announcing its embassy and consulate closures , said " a number of our embassies and consulates were going to be closed in accordance with local custom and practice for the bulk of the week for the @entity280 celebration at the end of @entity156			0
" strategic reason @entity249 said there could be a strategic reason for shutting down the diplomatic offices			0
" once you take targets away , it buys you additional time to try and disrupt , to identify the cell , the operators in country and the region , and work with your partners in the region to try and ... get them in custody or disrupt the plot , " she said			0
" so , some of this operationally is about buying time			0
" list of closures a total of 19 @entity4 embassies and consulates will be closed monday through saturday			0
the following 15 were part of the original list of 20 diplomatic facilities closed sunday : @entity4 embassy @entity321 , @entity323 @entity4 embassy @entity324 , @entity326 @entity4 @entity327 , @entity328 @entity4 @entity329 , @entity330 @entity4 embassy @entity331 , @entity331 @entity4 @entity333 , @entity334 @entity4 @entity335 , @entity323 @entity4 consulate @entity336 , @entity330 @entity4 @entity338 , @entity339 @entity4 embassy @entity341 , @entity342 @entity4 @entity343 , @entity344 @entity4 @entity345 , @entity346 @entity4 embassy @entity347 , @entity330 @entity4 @entity349 , @entity3 @entity4 @entity350 , @entity42 the following four embassies have been added : @entity4 @entity352 , @entity353 @entity4 @entity354 , @entity355 @entity4 @entity356 , @entity357 @entity4 embassy @entity358 , @entity360 @entity0 's @entity66 , @entity362 , @entity363 , @entity364 , @entity365 , @entity366 , @entity367 , @entity368 , @entity369 , @entity370 , @entity371 , @entity372 , @entity373 and @entity361 contributed to this report , which was written by @entity375 in @entity85 .			2
