-- @entity1 dropped their new @entity3 - penned single , " @entity2 " — a followup to their hit " @entity7 " and the second track released from the upcoming @entity8 — monday , and as expected , there 's nothing " little " about its online reaction			1
though the official lyric video has only been live for a few hours , it has already received over 127,000 likes and 55,000 comments on @entity16 , and as young girls across the @entity19 wake up and check their @entity20 , those metrics are only going to soar higher			2
because of that massive , adoring fanbase of occasionally irrational @entity1 , i realize what i 'm about to write might not be especially popular , but i 've got to be honest : this song is kind of messed up			1
yes , it 's a pretty , strummy offering that gives each boy his own solo ( for the first time , every individual 's voice is clearly recognizable ) , and yes , the stripped - back melody is rather lovely and characteristically @entity3 - y , but it 's the lyrics that i find troubling			1
i mean , just look at ' em : " i know you 've never loved the crinkles by your eyes , " sings @entity34 during the second stanza of the song			1
" you 've never loved your stomach or your thighs / the dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine / but i love them endlessly			2
" later in the song , during @entity51 ' verse , he sings , " you still have to squeeze into your jeans / but you 're perfect to me			1
" perhaps i 'd hear those lyrics differently if @entity3 had released this song for his own fans , but this is officially a @entity1 song now , and there 's something icky about the endlessly coiffed and tailored ( not to mention athletically - built ) boys delivering those words			1
last i checked , @entity1 's fans are n't composed mainly of aging obesity victims — they 're little girls who range in age from about 8 - 14			1
at the older end of that spectrum are girls currently enduring middle school , who may very well be feeling insecure about their bodies			2
in that case , it seems terribly misguided ( or at least ruthlessly conniving ) to tap into that insecurity with " @entity2 " and ask girls to find their validation in @entity1 's blanket affection			1
but i could maybe see how people would find the words sweet			0
more troubling to me are the younger fans who listen to this song			2
the carefree 9 - year - olds who nibble on fruit roll - ups on the way to gymnastics class			0
the ones who watch @entity83 before bed , getting one last year out of their @entity86 nightgowns			0
" @entity2 " presupposes insecurity in order to be effective lyrically , but for all those happily naive fans that ( thankfully ! ) are n't dealing with body image issues , @entity1 literally provides insecurities for listeners to feel			1
but that 's just part of why the whole pseudo-chivalrous " you 'll never love yourself half as much as i love you " vibe feels so disingenuous			0
one direction does n't — they simply ca n't — love each of their fans as much as they say they do			0
not in the way an insecure person needs to be loved to escape that awful cycle of self - reflection			0
they 're an international phenomenon touring the globe and clinking glasses with the rich and beautiful , not psychiatric counselors			0
their therapy by way of crooning is simply undercooked			0
