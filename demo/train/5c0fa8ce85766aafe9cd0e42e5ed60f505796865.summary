-- " less than human			0
" those are a just few of the dozens of responses @entity5 got when we asked our online community how their incomes make them feel			1
" my income makes me feel unwanted because @entity14 , like many people , have to rely on food assistance , " said @entity9 , a 31 - year - old from @entity11			1
" there is a huge gap that is unfair and unrealistic			0
( @entity19 ) minimum wage keeps this gap wide because you ca n't advance without higher education			0
we need to start more entry level jobs so that low income can work their way up			2
lower the cost to go to college so we can afford to go			0
" @entity5 : my income makes me feel ... plenty of pundits this week are talking about @entity33 's " @entity32 , " which has lasted 50 years now			1
somewhat missing from the conversation is the war that has emerged since the 1964 @entity37 address , when president @entity38 , as @entity39 describes it , " slowly put on his black - framed reading glasses , looked around at the assembled dignitaries and immediately issued a call to action " on @entity33 poverty			1
@entity33 's new war is on income inequality			1
it 's time we put our glasses on and saw this shift clearly			0
i started reporting on income inequality last year because @entity0 readers wisely voted me to cover that topic as part of the @entity56 project			1
i spent about two weeks reporting in @entity57 , @entity58 , which has the largest rich - poor gap in the nation			0
there , i learned that the income gap can get so wide that people do n't understand each other anymore			2
that 's what splits one @entity33 into two			1
related : the most unequal place in @entity33 how to change course ? that 's something i 've wrestled with in recent months			1
anyone who says they have all of the answers is lying to you			0
but i do think one way we can start to knit our nation back together is to talk about income inequality -- to acknowledge how different @entity33 is today from the time of @entity81 and @entity38 , when the rich were n't so stratospherically different from the rest of us , and when the minimum wage was actually worth more in real dollars than it is now			1
it 's clear the nation has been diverging			0
since the late 1970s , the @entity33 went from being a relatively egalitarian country to one of the more unequal places in the world			1
@entity33 is more unequal than @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 , according to the @entity97			1
and the 1 % continues to do better than the rest : that group saw 86.1 % real income growth from 1993 to 2012 , according to a @entity102 analysis			2
the bottom 99 % of the population only saw 6.6 % growth in their incomes during that time			0
related : is income inequality morally wrong ? it 's not about the numbers , though -- it 's about society			1
there 's research to show more unequal countries tend to have problems with health , education , incarceration and infant mortality			2
there 's an empathy gap , too , researchers have argued in books such as " @entity123 , " which was written by two epidemiologists			0
people stop knowing each other			0
that 's why we decided to ask @entity129 to submit essays , videos and photos about how their incomes make them feel			2
the goal was to initiate a conversation about the increasingly wide range of economic experiences in the @entity33			1
@entity138 , a 30 - year - old in @entity139 , said her income makes her feel " lost			1
" " i feel lost because although we are not in poverty anymore , we are not financially safe , " she said			1
" we still live paycheck to paycheck , just not as dire as years before			0
i feel lost because i can taste the ' @entity145 , ' but it 's like a tease			2
" related : war on poverty is n't over i think many @entity33 can identify with that limbo			1
the high cost of education -- a ladder out of poverty -- was another consistent theme			2
" i feel like i 'm living from paycheck to paycheck and owe more than i 'm worth , " said @entity157 of @entity158			2
she said she is struggling to pay down student loans while working a part - time job that has no benefits			0
" people say ' go to school , market yourself , cut back , ' etc. however , the recession taught me that you can have a good job , have a 401 ( k ) and have a degree , but still be the last to know your job is going to go under			0
" recently , there has been much talk about what would increase " economic mobility " in the @entity33 , which is the term academics use when they 're talking about the @entity145			1
the @entity33 has has fallen behind many @entity180 nations in that category			1
" if you want to live the @entity145 , " @entity182 , a researcher who studies income inequality , told me last year , " you 'd better go to @entity185 or @entity186			1
" there , it 's easier to get ahead			0
related : 5 things the world could teach @entity33 so it 's telling that @entity192 , the woman in @entity158 , also said the @entity145 , to her , is " not sustainable , let alone attainable			1
" it feels out of reach			0
shifting attitudes like that should scare us all			0
who wants to live in a country where people do n't believe they can get ahead anymore ? not all of the @entity5 responses to our query were negative , of course , but i did n't see any reports from the super-rich , either			1
( @entity210 ? @entity211 ? there 's still time ... ) @entity213 of @entity214 , @entity215 , said her income makes her feel " grateful			1
" she lost her job in 2008 but found a new , lower - paying gig in 2010			0
" many people that were hit with unemployment in 2008 lost homes , experienced many hardships just as i did , " she said			0
" many have never fully recovered			0
i feel like i had been given a chance to turn it around for myself			2
i will always be grateful			0
" related : how to help inequality , @entity33 that 's pretty incredible , huh ? not just because @entity228 has managed to remain " grateful " in the face of hardship but because she 's aware that others are n't so lucky			1
she has empathy for other @entity33			2
that 's something all of us , regardless of income , could take to heart			0
it 's not that the @entity32 is over			0
it is n't , and it should n't be			0
but extreme poverty exists , now more than in recent decades , alongside extreme wealth			0
it 's time for " @entity33 's longest war " to evolve and expand			1
