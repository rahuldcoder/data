-- when @entity2 watched president @entity4 's speech on @entity5 , he nearly broke down in tears			1
he does n't have a son or daughter headed off to war			1
but to him , his wife of 12 years was a war casualty : she was killed on september 11			2
when @entity4 described the attacks " and he described how the whole world was with us , it emotionally took me right back to that moment , " @entity2 said			1
" it was all i could do to keep from totally losing it			2
" @entity2 's wife , @entity19 , worked as an executive assistant for @entity21 on the 97th floor of the @entity23 of the @entity24 's @entity24			1
she sent an e-mail just two minutes before the first plane hit			2
" her office took a direct hit by the plane , and she was vaporized			0
there was nothing ever found of her , " @entity2 said			1
it 's been eight years since the attacks of september 11 killed 2,976 people			2
a lot of memories have faded , @entity2 said , but he still thinks of the little things : " holding her hand , falling asleep next to her , waking up next to her , the companionship , the partnership			1
" " she was great			0
" and so @entity2 was glued to his television tuesday for @entity4 's speech			1
he wanted to hear from the president how the nation is going to finish the job in what @entity2 calls " the womb of 9/11			1
" " to address these issues , " @entity4 said , " it is important to recall why @entity55 and our allies were compelled to fight a war in @entity5 in the first place			1
we did not ask for this fight			0
on september 11 , 2001 , 19 men hijacked four airplanes and used them to murder nearly 3,000 people			0
" they struck at our military and economic nerve centers			0
they took the lives of innocent men , women and children without regard to their faith or race or station			0
were it not for the heroic actions of the passengers on board one of those flights , they could have also struck at one of the great symbols of our democracy in @entity85 and killed many more			0
" those words brought it all home : the memories of his wife with the beautiful smile and short - cropped red hair			2
" i was biting my lip , " he said			0
that said , @entity2 is critical of the president 's strategy , mostly his announcement to begin withdrawing the @entity55 contingent in july 2011			1
" that is a tactical and strategic mistake , " he said			0
" if you 're playing chess , do you tell your opponent your next move ? " to broadcast that for the sake of politics , to me , that is very wrong			0
" and so he was divided : pleased about the renewed commitment to the @entity5 war but upset by the planned pullout date			1
@entity115 : share your views on @entity5 veteran @entity118 firefighter @entity117 lost his son , @entity120 , a fellow firefighter , on september 11			1
" i support president @entity4 's decision to send more troops to @entity5 and the war against @entity124 and the @entity125 , " he said			1
a combat veteran of @entity127 , @entity117 added , " the president and @entity129 need to ensure @entity55 has a clear strategy for our military in order to not repeat the strategic mistakes of @entity127			1
i also strongly believe our country needs to do more to support returning veterans			0
" the office of @entity138 overlooks ground zero , an every - day reminder of what happened on september 11 , 2001			0
he was standing outside the @entity24 when they were hit			0
@entity138 is now the president of the @entity144 , charged with the monumental task of building a living tribute to those who perished that day			0
" in the aftermath of 9/11 , there were a lot of citizens who signed up to do what they felt was a patriotic duty to respond to what happened , and many of them went to @entity5 , " @entity138 said			1
" so i think it 's important that we do n't forget that the history of 9/11 is still being written			1
there are still a lot of important things that have to be done in @entity5			1
" he added , " after the 1993 bombing of the @entity24 , we lapsed into complacency			0
and to have a focus on finishing what needs to be done , i think , is important			2
we ca n't fall back into that sense of isolation and complacency			1
by returning in force to @entity5 , he said , " we are going in now to keep ourselves from being attacked again			2
" this is not a war of choice , " @entity2 said			2
" this is a war of necessity			0
" he hopes the @entity55 people understand that			0
it 's why he can hardly speak when he sees @entity55 soldiers in uniform			2
" i am so grateful of the fact that they will lay their lives on the line for us , " he said			0
for military families who will soon send their loved ones off to @entity5 , @entity2 said , " thank you			1
it 's all you can say			2
thank you for making the decision to do it			0
thank you for loving your country			0
" " i just ask every person out there if it was your wife who went to work one day and never came home , " he said , " would you do anything to make sure it does n't happen again ? " @entity2 paused at the end of the conversation and said simply : " we have to remember 9/11			1

time to go after " womb of 9/11 , " says man who lost his wife
@entity2 says he 's pleased by @entity5 focus , upset by withdrawal plan
