@entity0 -- a number of websites including @entity4 and @entity5 posted a video wednesday showing four men dressed in @entity9 combat gear urinating on the apparently dead bodies of three men sprawled on the ground in front of them			1
one of the men says , " have a great day , buddy			1
" a voice asks , " you got it on the video ? " to which another voice responds , " yeah			1
" another jokes , " @entity24 , like a shower			0
" it was not clear who shot or posted the 39 - second video , who the people pictured in it were , or where it was shot			1
a senior @entity9 official who has examined the video said the @entity9 are carrying 30 - caliber sniper rifles and wearing helmets issued to members of @entity9 sniper teams			1
the helmets are designed with a shorter front and sides so that snipers can place rifles and scopes near their faces			0
the official , who said an investigating officer was expected to be named shortly , added that the desecration of a body by @entity49 troops could be considered a potential war crime			0

" this matter will be fully investigated and those responsible will be held accountable for their actions			1
we are in the process of verifying what unit these @entity9 are with right now and as soon as we have more information , we will let you know			2
" " regardless of the circumstances or who is in the video , this is egregious , disgusting behavior , " said @entity88 spokesman capt. @entity87			1
" in a statement , the @entity0 - based @entity98 condemned the video			2
