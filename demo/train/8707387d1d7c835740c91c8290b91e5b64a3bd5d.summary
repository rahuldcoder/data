republicans opposed to a @entity14 nomination have bandied about @entity8 's name for weeks , and thursday , senate minority leader @entity16 told @entity0 that @entity8 would be a " popular choice with the @entity18			1
" it 's ironic that several prominent republicans are rallying behind @entity8 , just eight years after their party demonized him during his failed 2004 presidential campaign against president @entity24			2
@entity8 remembered that experience in a statement he released about @entity14			1
" as someone who has weathered my share of political attacks and understands on a personal level just how difficult politics can be , i 've felt for her throughout these last difficult weeks , but i also know that she will continue to serve with great passion and distinction , " @entity8 said			1
if @entity8 replaces @entity35 , who replaces him ? the senior senator from @entity9 is noted for the experience , gravitas and relationship - building skills that could help him succeed as the @entity3 ' top diplomat			1

world travel is second nature to @entity8			2
while he was born in @entity56 , on december 11 , 1943 , he spent much of his childhood overseas , living in @entity58 , then went to a @entity60 boarding school at age 11			2
@entity46 's cabinet : who 's in , who 's out ? after graduating from @entity65 in 1966 , @entity8 was deployed to @entity66 as a lieutenant in the @entity68			0

he eventually entered politics in 1982 as lieutenant governor under @entity9 gov. @entity86			0
two years later , @entity8 won the @entity18 seat he has held for five consecutive terms			1
the @entity66 experience came back to haunt @entity8 during the 2004 presidential election			2
a @entity92 - funded group called " @entity93 " aired campaign ads accusing @entity8 of lying to receive two of his five combat decorations and criticizing his anti-war activism			1
the incumbent @entity24 won the @entity99 vote 292 to 252 and racked up 3 million more votes than @entity8 nationwide			0
after winning his fifth senate race in 2008 , @entity8 took over the @entity43 the next january			0
