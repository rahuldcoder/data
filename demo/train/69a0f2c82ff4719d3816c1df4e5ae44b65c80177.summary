-- responding to an allegation by the @entity3 chairman of the @entity4 that @entity6 's main intelligence agency has a " longstanding relationship " with a @entity9 - allied insurgent group that targets @entity3 troops in @entity11 , a senior @entity6 intelligence official said : " we do have a relationship : that of an adversary			1
" " we have made our resolve very clear that ( the @entity19 ) is an enemy we need to fight together , " said the official , who did not want to be identified discussing intelligence matters			2
in an interview that aired wednesday on @entity6 's @entity23 , adm. @entity21 spoke forcefully about the @entity19 , which he said " very specifically facilitates and supports the @entity9 who move in @entity11 , and they 're killing @entity3			1
" " i ca n't accept that and i will do everything i possibly can to prevent that specifically , " he said			0
then @entity21 said @entity6 's @entity29 " has a longstanding relationship with the @entity19			1
that does n't mean everybody in the @entity29 , but it 's there			2
" " i also have an understanding that the @entity29 and the ( @entity6 military ) exist to protect their own citizens , and there 's a way they have done that for a long period of time , " @entity21 said			1
" i believe that over time , that 's got to change			0
" based in @entity6 's @entity45 frontier , the @entity19 " has been at the forefront of insurgent activity in @entity11 , responsible for many high - profile attacks , " according to the @entity46			2
the group is believed to have three main sources of funds : donations from the @entity51 , drug trafficking , and @entity54 payments			0
@entity6 forces in december announced they had seized @entity56 , son of the group 's leader , @entity57			0
other @entity3 officials in recent months had expressed concerns that @entity6 has not been aggressively confronting militants operating in the tribal regions			2
the @entity6 intelligence official told @entity0 that " we have our hands full " fighting other @entity66 militant groups along the border with @entity11 , notably those under the umbrella of the @entity70 ( @entity70 ) " and once we are through with them we can turn on the other ( the @entity19 )			1
we do not have the capacity to undertake simultaneous operations			0
" the official said the " onus of providing proof of this " relationship was on the @entity3 and it was not up to the @entity29 " to start providing clarification			1
" asked if offense was taken by @entity21 's remarks , the intelligence official said : " not personally , no. " earlier in the @entity23 interview , @entity21 was pressed on issues such as the arrest of @entity87 contractor @entity86 and unmanned drone strikes against targets within @entity6 , which have marked what he called a " rough patch " of increasingly complex relations between the two nations in recent months			1
the admiral traced the difficulties back to the 12 - year period in which the two countries had severed diplomatic ties , then restored them in the midst of the global terrorism crisis that followed the attacks of september 11 , 2001			0
" we ca n't snap our fingers and say all of the sudden we trust each other , " he said , " and that 's what we 're trying to work our way through in the midst of these huge terrorist challenges that we both have			0
" " it 's the focus from the @entity3 ' perspective on the terrorist threat ( in the @entity113 ) , the @entity54 leadership which still lives there and still threatens to kill as many @entity3 as they possibly could , combined with what i would call this federation of terrorist organizations that are getting along more than they used to , and at least from my experience ... the complexity is increasing , not decreasing			0
" as @entity4 chairman , @entity21 is the highest - ranking uniformed official in the @entity3 military 's chain of command			1
he has been part of recent discussions that have included cia director @entity128 and their @entity6 counterparts : chief of army staff gen. @entity130 and the @entity29 's director , lt. gen. @entity132			2
@entity21 's term is set to end this year			0
" it 's been a very rough patch lately , " @entity21 said , " and i think the leaders , including @entity137 and @entity130 , director @entity128 and myself and others are very committed to working our way through this because we see the need to solve this problem , and we just ca n't walk away from it			1
" @entity0 's @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 contributed to this report .			0
