a federal judge in @entity1 has struck down part of that state 's law banning polygamy , after a lawsuit was brought by the stars of the television reality series " @entity9			1
" the ruling late friday by @entity11 district court judge @entity10 threw out the law 's section prohibiting " cohabitation , " saying it violates constitutional guarantees of due process and religious freedom			1
but the judge said he would keep in place the ban on bigamy " in the literal sense -- the fraudulent or otherwise impermissible possession of two purportedly valid marriage licenses for the purpose of entering into more than one purportedly legal marriage			1
" the 91 - page decision comes months after the @entity29 struck down a separate federal law that defined marriage as between only one man and one woman , a major legal , political , and social victory for homosexual couples seeking recognition of their same - sex unions			2

polyamory : when three is n't a crowd they claim their privacy rights were being violated by the decades - old law , passed around the time @entity1 became a state			1

@entity9 and his family said in a statement they were grateful for the ruling			1

" some religious groups criticized the ruling			0
" this is what happens when marriage becomes about the emotional and sexual wants of adults , divorced from the needs of children for a mother and a father committed to each other for life , " said @entity73 , of the @entity74			0
" @entity86 was outlawed in this country because it was demonstrated , again and again , to hurt women and children			0
sadly , when marriage is elastic enough to mean anything , in due time it comes to mean nothing			0
