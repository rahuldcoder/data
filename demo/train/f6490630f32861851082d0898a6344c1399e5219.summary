-- the @entity1 and @entity2 are on the same side when it comes to @entity5 , but you might not know it watching the bitter public disagreement that has broken out between the two allies over negotiations with the @entity11			1
is this a way for friends to handle their differences ? the talks with @entity5 present enormous challenges for @entity17			0
one of those challenges is to move through the process without damaging existing alliances or weakening @entity1 's already diminished standing in the @entity21			0
@entity2 prime minister @entity22 has warned that he thinks the @entity1 is falling into an @entity5 trap			1
the @entity24 says it is moving cautiously in the interest of peace and security			0
the disagreement is tearing at the alliance			0
both @entity2 and the @entity1 should find a different way to make their cases			1
they have moved perilously close to impugning each other 's character instead of debating the merits of their positions			0
@entity22 strongly objects to the proposal that would ease sanctions in exchange for a slowdown of @entity5 's nuclear program during negotiations for a permanent agreement			1
he is used to wielding sharp words			0
his tone has suggested @entity1 president @entity47 and secretary of state @entity48 are being played for fools			1
when talks broke off a few weeks ago , @entity22 sarcastically called the agreement that was almost reached between @entity5 and the so - called @entity52 , the @entity54 permanent members plus @entity55 , " the deal of the century " -- for @entity5			1
@entity58 , too , another @entity1 ally , called the proposal " a sucker 's deal			2
" but it 's not just critics of the @entity47 administration position who have come perilously close to insulting those with whom they disagree			0
@entity24 spokesman @entity68 responded to criticism and to calls for new sanctions by saying " the @entity1 people do not want a march to war , " as if those who do n't like this agreement actually want a war			0
the notion that @entity22 , that @entity2 , want war with @entity5 is patently absurd			1
some may think a war is unavoidable , but everyone in @entity2 knows war with @entity5 would bring unspeakable suffering			1
in @entity2 , the issue is personal for every family that lives within rocket range of @entity5 -- every family			1
many @entity2 dislike @entity22 's style , but they share his concern			1
today , only 31 % of @entity2 think @entity2 can rely on the @entity1 on talks with @entity5			1
what @entity2 wants is a strong deal , one that truly prevents @entity5 from having the ability to quickly build a nuclear weapon when it chooses			1
that , incidentally , is what @entity1 's @entity97 friends also want , creating an unlikely alignment of interests between @entity2 and @entity97			1
instead of " dissing " each other and engaging in acrimonious debate that brings satisfaction to their enemies , @entity2 and the @entity1 should concentrate on the substance of their disagreement			1
both @entity2 and the @entity1 -- not to mention @entity58 , @entity109 , the @entity110 , and others -- want to bring an end to what they believe is @entity5 's nuclear weapons program			1
@entity5 says it only wants nuclear power , but even @entity54 weapons inspectors say there are indications of a military aspect to @entity5 's nuclear program			2
@entity2 and the @entity1 , of course , have different perspectives			1
they differ on tactics , strategy , and to some degree on goals			0
the @entity1 is physically distant from @entity5 and it has a stronger military			2
@entity2 wants @entity5 to end all nuclear enrichment			1
the @entity1 is apparently willing to allow some enrichment and stockpiles			0
@entity1 sees @entity5 and its nuclear program as a challenge to global stability , to the regional balance of power , to nuclear nonproliferation			1
@entity2 believe @entity5 aims to destroy their country			2
on wednesday , as talks restarted in @entity142 , @entity5 's @entity140 ayatollah @entity139 gave a televised speech in which he called @entity2 the " rabid dog " of the @entity21 and declared that @entity2 " is doomed to failure and annihilation			2
" that kind of language , and a nuclear program , a wave of terrorist attacks , and the funding of anti-israel militias , such as @entity154 , add up to a pretty good case for @entity2 to worry			2
their concerns are echoed by many members of @entity158 , who also question the strength of the current negotiating approach			0
all want to see a deal , but only a good deal			0
all of them , lest we forget , are on the same side			0
@entity2 , along with @entity58 and many members of @entity158 , believes relief from sanctions should come only if @entity5 completely stops getting closer to a nuclear weapon			1
they worry that once world powers start rolling back sanctions , even slightly , the entire system will start unraveling			0
the @entity47 administration says the interim deal would " put time on the clock			0
" but @entity47 too said he wants to make " absolutely certain " the @entity5 are not " busy advancing their program " during talks			2
on the surface , @entity47 and @entity22 are saying much the same thing			2
it 's no simple task , but if a deal can be made that convinces everyone @entity5 is not within reach of a bomb , that would satisfy @entity1 , @entity2 , @entity1 's @entity97 friends and -- if @entity190 is telling the truth -- it should meet @entity5 's goals			1
we do n't know the exact terms under discussion in @entity142 , @entity196 , but some reports give reasons for concern			0
one element under discussion , for example , would reportedly allow continuing construction of the @entity204 plutonium facility , with a promise from @entity5 to delay operating it for six months ; far from ideal			0
it is also unclear what would happen with the @entity209 site , where @entity54 inspectors suspect @entity5 is working on ways to develop military components to weaponize its nuclear materials			0
instead of disparaging the administration 's negotiating skills , @entity22 , as a friend of the @entity1 , should raise questions about these issues			2
and instead of disparaging the motives of @entity22 and other critics , the @entity47 administration should respond to the specific claims			2
ironically , @entity2 's strong objections strengthen the @entity224 's negotiating position			2
it is @entity5 that should explain why it will not allow inspectors into @entity209 and why it needs to build a plutonium reactor			0
countries make alliances because they are stronger together			0
@entity2 and the @entity1 need to defend their alliance as they work together to stop @entity5 's nuclear program			1
anything else will only strengthen their enemies			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity238 .			0

@entity240 : @entity1 , @entity2 on same side on @entity5 but are at bitter odds on nuclear negotiations
she says @entity22 says @entity1 falling into trap ; @entity47 says @entity1 trying for peace , security
she says @entity2 has *legitimate* existential concerns over nukes in @entity5 , wants strong deal
@entity255 : lest they strengthen their enemies , @entity1 , @entity2 need to defend their alliance
