-- @entity2 's @entity1 was riding to a definitive victory as results from national elections came in early tuesday			1
preliminary results also showed that @entity1 prime minister @entity7 would remain in power for the third time and also showed that a left - leaning political party , the @entity10 , would be propelled to the historic position as the country 's official opposition			1
but equally as momentous , @entity2 's separatist party from @entity15 , the @entity16 , was nearly wiped off the political map in monday 's election , returning just a handful of members of parliament to the @entity22			1
according to preliminary results from @entity24 , @entity7 is set to win his first majority government with 166 seats out of a possible 308			1
his party 's share of the popular vote in @entity2 stood at about 40 % , as most of the votes were counted from across the country			2
the election started with a whimper and a near collective moan from @entity2 , as many called this an unnecessary election			0
but about three weeks into the five week campaign , the so - called ' @entity36 ' hit @entity15 , orange being the party colors of the @entity10			2
from his campaign headquarters in @entity42 , @entity7 hailed the @entity1 victory , saying @entity2 had made a clear choice			1
" they chose hope , hope and unity of purpose and a strong @entity2 , " said @entity7 before adding that he would be a leader for all @entity2			2
while polls had predicted the @entity10 's popularity , the results stunned even party insiders			1
party leader @entity54 said that @entity2 had said no to " politics of usual			2
" the surge of support for the @entity10 in @entity15 turned out to be a game - changer not just in that province but across the country			0
" tonight @entity2 voted to improve health care -- public health care , " @entity54 said , underscoring his party 's policies in support of seniors and families			2
@entity68 , the former @entity69 scholar who returned to @entity2 in 2005 to get into politics , led his liberal party to arguably one of its worst defeats			0
for the first time , the party of former @entity2 prime minister @entity76 finished third			1
" it is tough to lose like this , " @entity68 bluntly told supporters in @entity79			0
" democracy teaches hard lessons and we have to learn them all , " he said			0
" leaders have to accept their historic responsibility for their historic defeat			0
" this election will change the political dialogue in @entity2 with the conservatives potentially in full control of law - making in the @entity22			0
some of @entity7 's priorities for defense , the economy and justice issues now stand a much better chance of becoming law			0
the head of @entity2 's @entity101 also made history on monday night			1
@entity103 became the first @entity101 member to be elected to parliament			0
the election was called after @entity2 's @entity22 passed a no - confidence resolution aimed at @entity7 's government , triggering the dissolution of @entity110			1
