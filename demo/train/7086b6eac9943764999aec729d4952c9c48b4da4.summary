scotia , @entity0 -- @entity2 folds the red , white and blue quilt before it is packed up and sent to @entity4 , some 400 miles away in @entity5			1
" i do n't like seeing so many young people go away and come back wounded , " @entity6 says			2
" unfortunately right now it 's just a fact of life and i try to do what i can			2
" our servicemen need to know that it 's not just their family and friends that are supporting them			2
there 's a whole country rooting for them , and i 'm one			2
" the quilt is one of several that @entity6 and her fellow members of @entity25 -- @entity26 in learning together , @entity28 -- have made as part of the quilts for @entity32 project			1
" several years ago , " says @entity6 , " i heard at our quilting guild meeting that somebody wanted to organize this and get it started in our area , and i thought ' i can do that			2
' i can just change the fabrics and make it more patriotic			2
the more i did the more i wanted to do , and now , i just do it			2
this is my 27th quilt for this project			1
" the quilt @entity6 recently made for the project is a large bed quilt			1
" we have the red , white and the blue , and the stars and the stripes , " @entity6 says as she holds up the quilt top			2
" it 's perfect , do n't you think ? " @entity6 has been quilting for 25 years , and her sewing room is filled with a wide variety of colorful threads and a seemingly endless supply of yard lengths and squares of fabrics she has collected over the years			0
" i 've probably made 20 to 30 bed quilts , more than 100 baby quilts for another charity event , and innumerable amounts of wall hangings that i make and give away , " she says			1
" it 's my pleasure to make it and to give it			0
it just makes me feel good			0
" finished quilts for soldiers are boxed up and sent to @entity5 , where the quilts for @entity32 project began in 2003			1
@entity78 is the project 's chairwoman , and the quilts are delivered directly to her front door in @entity83 , @entity5			1
" it 's like @entity85 every day when a box comes in , " @entity78 says			0
" especially if you 're a quilter			0
you do n't know what you 're going to get when you open that box			0
" as the number of wounded soldiers increased , so did the need for more quilts			1
@entity78 and other members of the @entity96 of @entity5 could n't handle the need , so they put an ad in a national quilting magazine			0
" now , " @entity78 says , " people from all over the @entity100 , @entity101 and even @entity102 have donated quilts			1
" in her bedroom hallway , several large bags are stuffed full of more than 70 quilts and blankets to be brought to @entity4 and handed to the soldiers as they arrive back in the @entity100			1
" some of our quilts are separated because of the military affiliation			1
you do n't necessarily want to give an @entity115 guy a @entity117 - themed quilt , " @entity78 says , laughing			0
" it 's all one military , but they each love their specific branch			1
" a letter is attached to each quilt telling soldiers about the project and thanking them for their service , @entity78 says			1
at @entity4 , @entity129 volunteers take over the operation , delivering the quilts to soldiers			1
@entity6 's quilt found its new home with @entity135			0
@entity136 returned from @entity138 with a crushed foot and bruising on his leg			0
" when i was passing through all the hospitals and medical centers on my way home , i noticed all these quilts on pretty much all of the hospital beds , " @entity136 says			1
" every one was different , and all of them are really beautiful			0
i think it 's awesome that they put their time and effort into making these			0
it 's a great way to say ' thank you ' to the wounded soldiers			1
" @entity136 , whose father and uncle served in the @entity117 , said he 'll probably put the quilt in his bedroom " so that it 's close to me all the time			0
" on the back edge of @entity136 's quilt is a patch sewn in by @entity6 that reads : " thank you for your service to our country			0
