@entity0 is on the verge of its initial public offering and everyone 's knickers have been in a knot all week over the company 's lack of management diversity -- that is , women			1
as the @entity11 put it last week , " the board ? all white men			2
the investors ? all men			2
the executive officers ? all men but for the general counsel , @entity19 , who has had the job for five weeks			0
" question : why is this a problem ? first , there are n't enough women at @entity0 or in the tech world because there are n't enough women anywhere			1
some facts : women make up 6 % of chief executives at the leading 100 tech companies , and that has taken years to accomplish			1
most startups have all - male boards			1
in 2012 women held 16.6 % of @entity37 board seats			1
women of color were 3.3 % of the total			1
fully one - tenth had no women serving on their boards at all			1
in the past five years , women and minorities have lost ground despite evidence strongly suggesting that gender parity and board diversity have positive effects on profitability			0
@entity0 had more than a year to prepare for this ipo : where are the women ? the company 's immediate response focused on a " paucity of candidates			1
" the tech industry has a well - documented pipeline problem , one largely the result of gender stereotypes that reach into the educational system			1
however , companies regularly draw executives from outside their own industries -- sometimes , yes , even women -- when seeking senior - level and board positions			1
it enables them to cross-pollinate ideas , diversify their expertise and innovate			0
for example , @entity72 has hired @entity75 ceo @entity74			0
during her tenure at @entity75 , the company doubled its revenues and tripled its share price			0
companies redefine " pipeline " every day -- particularly when profits are involved			0
the technology sector dresses itself up as progressive when in reality it shows every indication of being , at its core , powerfully retrograde			0
despite investing in diversity programs , the management of tech firms is distinctly not diverse , and indeed the industry continues to " dazzle " with incidents in which men gleefully display their not even implicit biases			1
last month 's @entity96 debacle ( click and weep ) , as well as @entity98 's long - overdue firing of cto @entity99 ( who 'd for years been churning out such sexist , racist , tweets as " @entity101 gets raped by a pack of n * * * * s. it 's his own fault for dressing like a whore though " ) are two recent examples			1
second , sexism is seamlessly coupled with the distribution of capital			0
@entity111 's september launch of @entity112 , a " women 's centric " website ( " world news and politics alongside beauty tips " ) was a blunt force case in point			1
after announcing the site with a tone - deaf post , @entity111 was widely mocked for his personal failure to grasp , among other things , how ridiculous his claim to be starting the " first site of its kind " for women was			2
the real issue is n't @entity111 's cluelessness , but the institutional biases that enabled him to raise $ 6.5 million when far more able , knowledgeable and experienced women ca n't			2
companies with at least one woman founder make up only 13 % of those funded			0
venture capitalists are less likely to invest in startups if there are women involved in their management ; investors actively reduce holdings in companies that appoint female directors			0
these are particular ironies since women - run startups use 40 % less capital to launch			1
these facts do n't reflect women lacking in confidence ideas			0
they illustrate discrimination , whether it is conscious or not			0
third , while we think of @entity0 as a tech company , it is a media company and part of a larger environment that does little to correct its failure at diversity			1
year after year , studies such as one last week from the @entity163 , as well as reports from who makes the @entity166 and the @entity167 on @entity169 document exactly how distorted mainstream media ownership , management and production remain			2
only online is the situation improving			0
but even there the difference is largely gains in women - oriented " pink - collar " content			2
how can we separate these facts from ownership ? we ca n't			0
as reported by the @entity180 , our media are almost entirely owned and managed by white men			2
lastly , what does this have to do with speech ? everything			0
male experiences , interests , expectations and voices , mainly white , inform the way we think , decide how our resources are dispersed and define our norms			0
the ghettoized status of women and minorities in media and technology , coupled with the lack of venture capital investments , means that our attempts to express ourselves are limited , misrepresented and regularly repackaged to make what we say palatable to a sexist status quo			1
and this status quo is entirely uninterested in the idea of women as capable , autonomous leaders who might change norms in unsettling , risky ways			1
stating these facts baldly is not an indictment of white men as individuals			0
it is a description of systemic problems that we refuse to confront with systemic solutions			0
the presence of a carefully selected handful of women in tech , regardless of how determined , able and prominently visible they are , has for decades done little to alter the makeup of management and ownership			2
gender diversity at @entity0 , as elsewhere , is n't a priority because people make reasonable decisions about what they believe will be profitable and successful : @entity0 is looking for experience and expertise within a comfort zone			2
" this to me is not a gender issue , it 's an innovation issue , " @entity0 ceo @entity232 has explained			1
gender issues are n't innovation issues only if your gender is dominant and the norm			0
this rationale , and others like it , are exactly the kind of " 1,000 paper cuts " marginalization that result in fewer women pursuing tech careers to begin with			2
@entity0 is one part of a male dominated social structure , economy and culture , all of which rely on cradle - to - grave sexism to be profitable			1
that 's tweetable by the way .			0

@entity258 : @entity0 , on verge of ipo , is under fire with leadership that 's virtually all men
she says it reflects larger dearth of women in tech , media fields -- 6 % of tech ceos are women
she says sexism abounds in male - dominated field and guides investment , leaving women out
@entity258 : controlling women 's access makes men *keepers* of speech , keeps sexist status quo
