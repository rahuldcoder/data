-- tired of seeing developed nations take the lion 's share of profits from his countrymen 's coffee crop , @entity2 businessman @entity1 decided back in 2003 that it was time for a new business arrangement			1
@entity2 is @entity12 's second - biggest exporter of coffee beans , currently producing around 3.4 million bags per year			1
yet instead of being refined locally , the vast majority of the country 's raw beans have been traditionally exported in the consuming countries of the @entity19 for processing			0
but @entity1 's vision was to create a quality @entity2 coffee company that would be able to place a finished product on the shelves of both local and international supermarkets			1
a trained economist , he devised a business model encouraging local coffee farmers to sell their beans to him at a fair price			2
his company would then roast , package and brand the final product , whilst the profits would be split 50/50			2

we have blessed soils , you guys have a commodity which is of great value , " says @entity1 , recalling his first meetings to convince the farmers in @entity2 's @entity51 district			1
" we can pay you a premium price ; we can also add value to your knowledge ; we can help train you ; we can set up savings and credit co-ops and we can really work together and begin to own the value chain which is historically being controlled outside the producer country			0
" we needed to change that -- and through trade we could bring prosperity to our farmers and their communities			2
" read this : @entity2 midwife , @entity71 ? these words by @entity1 planted the seeds for what went on to become @entity75 , a @entity76 - based company that has helped transform the lives of thousands of farmers in @entity2			1
over the last nine years @entity75 says it has built a network of more than 14,000 coffee farmers , who are organized into 280 farmer groups			1
the company , which is the first @entity12 - owned coffee brand to be available in @entity85 supermarkets , has also helped local farmers to set up several savings and credit cooperatives			1
" ( it 's ) about empowerment and it 's also about ownership , " says @entity1			2
" it 's about owning the value chain , growing the coffee , processing it at source and it 's about exporting a finished product , " he adds			2
" so we retain the value , which means we can employ people , we can pay taxes , we can prosper our farmers and their communities			0
and that 's the only sustainable way in which societies have prospered -- by moving from low - value agriculture into high - value manufacturing industrialization			0
" at the heart of all of @entity1 's efforts is his strong belief in the transformative power of self - help			1
in trade , and not aid , he says , is where @entity12 's future well - being lies			1
" every society and economy that 's prospered has done it through their own hard work , ingenuity , dedication and commitment , " he says			0
" not through charity , not through handouts , and i think that 's a powerful message and it 's a powerful model			0
it 's not new , but i think it 's one that i think resonates with consumers who are willing to interact with products like that			0
" watch this : @entity133 on aid @entity1 's philosophy is clearly defined in " a @entity145 , " his book published earlier this year chronicling all the challenges he and his enterprise faced -- from gaining the trust of banking institutions to convincing foreign retailers about working directly with an @entity12 company			1
he says he decided to write the book because just a handful of @entity12 businesspeople write about their experiences			0
" all of us have a story , " he says			0
" we need to share that story ; that story edifies , it encourages , it inspires others in our own way and i just found @entity12 business does n't really write			0
" by sharing his story with the world , @entity1 wants to help create a new narrative about @entity12 and inspire the continent 's next generation of entrepreneurs			1
" seventy percent of our population on the continent are young people -- the same young people that we want to set up businesses , become entrepreneurs , innovators in @entity167 , you name it , " he says			0
" and the only way they 'll be encouraged and inspired is if they read about stories about other @entity12 business people			0

@entity2 businessman @entity1 is the founder of @entity75

@entity1 's message is that the future of @entity12 lies in trade , not aid
