@entity0 -- the @entity2 heard new arguments wednesday in a dramatic case that started with a movie attacking @entity6 -- but that could have far - reaching implications for @entity9 elections			1
the campaign finance case before the court stems from a film critical of then - presidential candidate @entity6			1
" if you thought you knew everything about @entity6 , wait till you see the movie , " said an ad last year for " @entity6 : @entity18 , " a scorching attack on the woman then running for president			1
@entity22 , the conservative group behind the film , promoted it as featuring 40 interviews -- a " cast to end all casts " -- and promised that if " you want to hear about the @entity27 scandals of the past and present , you have it here ! ' @entity6 : the movie ' is the first and last word in what the @entity32 want @entity9 to forget ! " few @entity9 ever saw the ad ; a federal court ruled that it broke the law on campaign advertising			1
@entity22 argued that the movie was a documentary , not " electioneering communication			1
" as a result , the group argued , it was not subject to campaign finance rules that require disclosure of the movie 's financial backers or restrictions on when the film could air			1
it was financed with a mix of corporate and individual donations			0
@entity22 , a @entity0 - based nonprofit advocacy group , took its case to the @entity2			1
unusually , the top court did not reach a decision on the case after it was first heard and ordered wednesday 's rare september rehearing to consider more aspects of the case			2
a ruling is expected in a couple of months			1
the case hinges on whether corporations can be barred from pouring money into election campaigns or whether they have free - speech rights -- and the right to spend their cash to influence elections , just like individual people do			1
" it 's about money , " said @entity72 , former general counsel of the @entity73 and a national expert on campaign spending			2
" it 's about free speech , and it 's about the ability of corporations to influence elections through the direct use of their ... money			2
" @entity87 of @entity88 said the courts were right in the first place			0
" allowing corporations to flood our elections and use campaign expenditures to buy influence would fundamentally undermine our democracy , " he said			1
" the little guy would have no role here , because the dominant force in politics -- the dominant force in @entity0 decision - making -- would become corporations			2
" but @entity103 of @entity22 does n't buy that			0
he argued that groups of people who pool resources , ranging from labor unions to the health industry to advocacy groups like the @entity111 , still have the right to free speech			0
" i do n't believe the federal government should have the right to impede people 's entry into the [ political ] process , " he said			2
" and that 's what i believe the @entity73 is doing here : squelch our first amendment rights			0
" @entity9 courts have consistently ruled that spending money on elections is a form of speech			2
the case has made for unusual alliances : the @entity133 , for example , sides with @entity22			0
" for many free - speech advocates , this is maybe a case of strange bedfellows , but they agree with @entity22 , " said @entity135 law professor @entity134			0
" they say , ' if you start to say these types of movies are prohibited speech , it could sweep into things like books			0
' indeed , [ the first time this case was argued , ] the @entity9 government said , ' yes , we could restrict books during these election periods , ' " @entity134 said			0
" that sent a chill through the free - speech community			0
on the other side , people are saying , ' yeah , campaign finance [ reform ] is strangling the democratic process , ' " he said			0
" you have two worthy values and very strong values on both sides , " he said on @entity1 's " @entity163			0
" " there 's a great deal at stake , " he said			0
" if they strike down part of the campaign finance laws , it occurs right before the mid-term [ elections ] , and you would see major amounts of money dumped into the campaign			1
" the court 's rare special session marks the debut of justice @entity184 , president @entity185 's first @entity2 nominee			1
the original narrow focus of the case was on @entity188 of the comprehensive 2002 @entity190 law , which bans the broadcast of " electioneering communication " by corporations , unions and advocacy groups if such a broadcast would be aired close to election dates and would identify candidates by name or image			1
the law also requires an on - screen notice of the groups financing such ads as well as public disclosure of all donors to the sponsoring organizations			0
but the scope of the case has now expanded significantly , and justices will ask whether they should re-examine important precedents banning direct corporate spending in campaigns			0
the @entity27 movie case could launch a range of as - yet unanswered questions about political speech and government regulation			1
since the filmmakers argued that their work was information , not political advocacy , should the government place itself as the ultimate arbiter of what is " news " ? some media groups say no. " ' @entity6 : the movie ' does not differ , in any relevant respect , from the critiques of presidential candidates produced throughout the entirety of @entity9 history , " said the @entity228 in a brief to the high court			1
and can distinctions be drawn between regulating quickie 30 - second or one - minute " attack ads " and a 90 - minute documentary that could be viewed as an ideological " infomercial " ? " @entity190 clearly has an impact on every candidate and everyone that raises or spends campaign dollars , " said @entity242 , author of " @entity243 , " an inside look at the @entity2			1
" and the court has mediated that line between trying to allow @entity252 to protect against electoral corruption but at the same time protect the right of expression of corporations and individuals			2
" movie excerpts and the ads can be seen at @entity260			0
the case is @entity22 v. @entity73 ( 08 - 205 )			0
@entity1 @entity2 producer @entity262 and @entity263 contributed to this report .			2
