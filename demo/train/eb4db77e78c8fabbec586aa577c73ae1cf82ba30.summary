-- @entity1 is not only a @entity3 and fashion icon , but as a dating columnist , she 's considered a dating icon as well			1
why ? she 's selfish , immature , manipulative , impulsive , and , let 's face it , kind of psycho			2
the @entity0 : 10 spoiler - free reasons to see " @entity12 " she gives women , even kooky women , a bad name			2
ladies , feel free to emulate @entity1 's style and visit her favorite @entity18 haunts , but when it comes to dating , it 's best to do anything but what she does			1
@entity1 makes several common mistakes throughout the " @entity27 " series and by watching her missteps , women can learn a lot about what to do and , more importantly , what not to do , at all stages of a relationship			1
the @entity0 : cattiest reviews about " @entity34 " do n't assume			2
when @entity1 begins dating @entity36 , she assumes that since she 's not seeing anyone else , he 's not either			1
predictably , she 's shocked when she finds him at dinner with another woman			2
although she and @entity42 had shared a bed together , they had only gone on two dates by that point ; he certainly did n't owe her exclusivity , especially when they had n't discussed it			2
if you do n't want your new guy to date anyone else , make sure he knows it			2
while there 's no magic time to have the " what do we call this relationship " talk , it 's imperative that you have the talk at some point			0
@entity63 does n't solve anything			0
@entity1 often falls into the trap of over and over and over-analyzing every aspect of her relationships , wondering what each and every little tiny thing means			1
she looks for hidden meanings in the most ordinary events			0
when @entity42 takes her to the same restaurant twice in a row , she looks for a secret motive			0
she listens to answering machine messages from him repeatedly , straining to hear what he 's not saying			0
sometimes , men are not up - front about why they do what they do , but most of the time , a restaurant is just a restaurant and a message is just a message			0
" @entity27 " existed in a time before cell phones were ubiquitous , @entity86 was a verb , and posting on @entity88 and @entity89 became a national pastime			0
yet @entity1 still manages to stalk @entity42 , following him to church to see what he does on sundays and with whom , and concocting a scheme to meet his ex-wife			1
while there 's nothing wrong with looking up a new date online , cyberstalking or , worse , actually stalking someone likely wo n't end well			1
when he finds out that you 've been moonlighting as a private investigator , he wo n't be flattered			0
instead , he 'll wonder what he 's getting himself into and will probably be ready to end what may have just started			0
drama does n't equal passion			1
@entity1 is scared when @entity107 seems " too perfect			1
" she wants to know what 's wrong with him and insists he must be hiding a big secret from her			0
as she ponders her new relationship , she writes , " do we need drama to make a relationship work ? " the answer is no. unfortunately , many women equate drama with passion			1
a relationship filled with drama is usually exciting because you never know what could happen -- good or bad			1
that kind of excitement can be destructive and is ultimately unsustainable			0
a drama - free relationship is n't one that 's necessarily without love or passion ; it 's one that 's mature enough to not need the emotional roller coaster			1
the @entity0 : i 'm a " @entity133 " type -- not a " @entity1 " -- and i love it " @entity136 " does n't exist			1
even as @entity107 is too perfect , @entity1 insists on perfection when she goes out with @entity138 for the first time			1
she goes shopping for the perfect outfit and tries to think of what activity they can do to make it the perfect first date			0
however , she soon realizes that @entity138 is n't interested in her clothes or doing the best thing ever on a date ; he 's interested in her			1
when we strive for perfection , we 're bound to be disappointed because no date , guy or relationship will ever live up to that expectation			0
in one of the most memorable scenes of the series , @entity138 dumps @entity1 on a post-it note			2
was he nasty and immature ? absolutely ! but was she right to yell at his friends when she ran into them at the club opening ? no. of course , she was hurt and angry , but she ranted at the wrong audience			0
although he was a jerk , she made herself look ridiculous			0
everyone is dumped at some point -- if you take the high road , he 'll look like the bad guy and it wo n't look like he had a reason to end things			2
the @entity0 : when he is n't over his old girlfriend if you 're not yourself around him , he 's not right for you			1
when she 's dating @entity179 , @entity1 subverts herself and her desires to please her new man			1
she feigns interest in his interests and eventually gives up her career , apartment and city for him			0
it 's great to explore new things in a relationship -- in fact , one of the best aspects of dating is that it opens you up to new people and ideas -- but when you stop acting like yourself and start taking on your boyfriend 's ideas and ideals , it 's time to disentangle from the relationship and find yourself again			1
magical endings are for movies			0
the series ends when @entity1 reunites with both @entity3 and @entity42			2
sweeping camera angles , soaring music , and kissing under lampposts in the rain are great for fiction , but sometimes holding hands on the couch says more about a couple 's commitment to each other			0
do n't forget to cherish the small moments while you wait for the big ones that might never come			0

columnist says women should not emulate @entity1 's dating styles
do n't equate drama with passion -- roller coaster emotions are destructive
give up over-analyzing every aspect of your relationships
ladies , if you 're not yourself around him , he 's not right for you
