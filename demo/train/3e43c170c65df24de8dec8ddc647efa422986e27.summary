the @entity12 pulled out of its command observation post , telling journalists and onlookers to get out of the way of the flames			1
@entity51 was among the residents watching helplessly			2
" my house is right through here , though it may be gone , " he told @entity37			2
nearby ranchers battled to save their herds from the encroaching fire			2
" i 'm just moving them from pasture to pasture , " @entity58 told @entity37 , referring to her livestock			2
" as one pasture burns , i 'm moving them back to that one and bring ( ing ) them back around			0

@entity1 is experiencing the worst fire season in state history			0

the record - setting heat and drought plaguing @entity1 and @entity98 -- as well as a heat wave experienced by other states -- result from abnormally strong high pressure over the @entity138 and @entity139			0
the high pressure keeps the jet stream , typically a source of cooler air and precipitation , to the north , while winds funnel hot , tropical air into the south - central @entity148 , according to @entity149 , which released satellite data wednesday showing the phenomenon during july			1
but the conditions persist , said @entity2 meteorologist @entity153			0
" the ridge of high pressure aloft refuses to release its grip			0
there are some subtle signs that it may weaken into next week and allow a tropical system to move into " southeastern @entity1 , he said			0
" this would have the potential to bring some very significant and beneficial rains to that area			0
but it looks like @entity98 is going to remain high and dry			0

the @entity10 is 50 % contained
some evacuations have been lifted , an official says
