-- she was the one caught driving drunk , but in an odd twist of political fate , he 's now the one who has just been indicted on felony charges			1
on the face of it , you might think that @entity9 , district attorney for @entity10 in @entity11 , would be out of her job after being caught driving under the influence , haranguing those who took her in , being convicted and serving 20 days in jail			1
but it 's her bitter political rival @entity11 gov. @entity18 who 's now facing serious charges for how he reacted to what she did			1
here are four reasons why @entity18 -- a possible candidate for the 2016 @entity24 presidential nomination -- is in more trouble than the district attorney caught driving with a 0.239 blood alcohol level , nearly three times the state 's legal limit			1
walking the line she failed miserably to walk a straight line in a field sobriety test , but he 's accused of crossing a political legal line			2
@entity18 joined others calling for @entity9 to step down after her @entity38 arrest			2
but when she refused , he threatened to and then did withhold funding for a program run by @entity9 -- a powerful @entity41 in a heavily @entity24 state			1
@entity43 take the field sobriety test some saw his action as strictly political , and an illegal overreach of his powers as governor			0
he ended up in a police booking room , getting his mug shot and fingerprints taken -- making @entity18 the first @entity11 governor in nearly 100 years to face criminal charges			1
and the two felony counts that charge @entity18 with abusing his power hit the longest - serving governor in the state 's history right at the moment he 's switching his presidential ambitions into high gear			1
talking the talk in her drunken state , with a blood alcohol level of 0.239 , @entity9 mouthed off to officers and jailers			0
@entity18 let money do the talking			2
he threatened to use his veto power to cut state funding for a special unit in @entity9 's control -- the @entity74 -- if she did not step down after her conviction			1
watch @entity9 in jail @entity9 would not budge , so @entity18 pulled the $ 3.5 million in annual state funding for the unit , which ironically investigates wrongdoing by public officials across @entity11			1
@entity18 has the right to veto whatever he likes , but threatening to do so to get something he wanted was illegal , according to @entity82 , a liberal group that filed the complaint against @entity18			2
location , location , location a blueberry in a bowl of tomato soup			0
that 's what @entity18 calls @entity10 , where @entity93 like @entity9 reign			1
the county , home of the state capital , @entity97 , is a spot of blue in an overwhelmingly red state			0
in 2012 , @entity10 voted for president @entity101 while the rest of the state overwhelmingly went for @entity104			0
the members of the grand jury that approved the indictment were selected from that @entity93 county , but those involved in the legal case say their decision had nothing to do with politics			0
@entity0 spoke to several grand jurors , and they said politics never entered their secret discussions			0
one did add though that the decision to indict the governor was not unanimous			0
they said the special prosecutor , @entity120 , was fair and demonstrated how the governor violated the law			0
read the indictment the law @entity9 pleaded guilty to @entity38 , served nearly three weeks in jail , went to rehab and then went back to her job as the district attorney , able to ignore the calls for her to step down			2
the felony charges against @entity18 are much more serious and would not allow him such latitude were he to be found guilty			1
he faces one count of abuse of official capacity and one count of coercion of a public servant , with the maximum sentence for both at more than 100 years in prison			0
@entity18 calls the charges an " injustice			2
" " the actions i took were not only lawful and legal but right , " he told reporters at the @entity143 , where he appeared voluntarily to have his mugshot and fingerprints taken			0
indeed , legal analysts , including @entity0 's @entity148 , a former federal prosecutor , question the indictment			0
" the governor has the power to veto this money , " @entity148 said			0
" so , the question is , how can it be a crime to threaten to use a power that is entirely within the powers of your office ? " @entity18 is now in his last few months in office after his 14 years in the governor 's mansion			1
speculation that he 's eyeing the @entity161 continues , but he may well have to solve this court case first			0
5 reasons gov. @entity18 is underrated @entity18 takes back tweet			1

@entity11 gov. @entity18 has been indicted on accusations he abused his power
charges stem from his threat to cut program run by a local @entity173 unless she *resigned*
both @entity18 and the @entity173 got mug shots -- hers for drunk driving charge
but while she 's back at work , he has to defend himself against felony charges
