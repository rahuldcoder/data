-- @entity1 could have no more fitting symbol of its tumultuous history than its national flag			1
emblazoned with a green cedar tree against a white background , framed between two red bands , an official account states the white represents peace , the red , the blood that has been spilled in the name of liberation and the tree , survival			2
situated on the eastern-most lip of the @entity19 basin -- in a region once known as the @entity21 -- @entity1 stands at the gateway between @entity23 and the @entity25 @entity24 and @entity26			1
throughout its history it has been the scene of bitter struggles			1
as far back as @entity30 , @entity31 -- realizing its importance as a strategic gateway to the @entity19 -- led a seven - month siege at @entity36 , modern @entity1 's fourth largest city			1
originally an island city , @entity31 spared no effort in taking the @entity41 city state , constructing a 1km - long causeway to connect the island with the mainland as part of his invasion plan			1
part of the @entity48 from the early 16th century , @entity1 became a @entity50 mandate after @entity51 and achieved independence in 1943			2
in the 20th century , it suffered violent shifts in its fortunes			2
once known as the " @entity56 " because of its cosmopolitan nature , @entity55 proudly boasted that it was the only city in the world where you could swim in the @entity19 in the morning and then drive to the mountains to go skiing in the afternoon			1
others compared it with @entity65 as its reputation grew as a financial center in the 1960s			2
until the mid- 1970s the country prospered , but conflict between the @entity73 and @entity74 communities , the influx of @entity77 refugees , and repeated wars in the region destabilized the country			1
civil war erupted in 1975 and did not end until 1990			1
the first general elections in 20 years were held in 1992			2
the civil war broadly pitted @entity77 and @entity74 militias against @entity1 's @entity73 militias , devastating the country in the process			1
an estimated 150,000 people were killed and thousands fled the country			2
the @entity1 diaspora is thought to be around 14 million , according to the @entity90 ( @entity90 ) , with the majority in @entity92 and the @entity93			0
the country had an estimated 4,125,247 people in july 2010 , according to figures from the @entity96 , although no official census has been taken since 1932 because of the sensitive political balance between @entity1 's various religious groups			2
the country is known to have a " confessional democracy " and refers to a system of government whereby political and institutional power is distributed proportionally among religious communities			1
the presidency is reserved for a @entity106 , the prime minister is a @entity108 and the speaker of parliament a @entity111			0
according to the @entity90 , @entity1 is home to 18 separate religious sects and several different ethnic groups			0
key to understanding @entity1 is its fractious and often bloody relationship with its neighbors , @entity116 and @entity117			0
with the formation of @entity116 in 1948 , thousands of @entity77 refugees flooded into @entity1 altering the country 's finely balanced demographic			2
according to the @entity124 ( @entity124 ) , the international body set up to ensure the welfare of @entity77 refugees , there are about 400,000 officially registered @entity77 refugees in @entity1 , or approximately 10 % of the population			0
just under half of the refugees continue to live in camps			0
in 1982 , @entity116 launched a full - scale invasion of @entity1 to counter the @entity132 ( @entity132 )			0
that year the @entity133 militia group @entity133 was formed with the purpose of ridding @entity1 of @entity116 influence			0
most @entity116 troops were withdrawn by 1985 , although @entity116 remained in the south until 2000 when it dismantled a 12 - mile security buffer zone it had maintained inside @entity1 territory since 1978			0
@entity1 's eastern neighbor @entity117 has also been influential in the country 's affairs and internal politics			1
@entity117 troops arrived in 1976 shortly after the civil war started and did not leave until 2005			1
their withdrawal was precipitated by the assassination of former prime minister @entity148			0
many @entity150 elements within @entity1 blamed the assassination on the @entity117 government and the @entity133 , claims they denied			0
even with ongoing political tensions and spasms of violence , since 2005 , @entity1 has worked hard to emerge from this bitter legacy , reinventing itself as trendy tourist destination			0
thanks to the rejuvenation of war - torn central @entity55 , one of the largest and most ambitious urban redevelopment projects in the region , @entity55 is once more laying claim to its as title of the " @entity56			1
" but even as the nightspots and cafes begin to repopulate a battered @entity55 , the country remains a hostage to its geopolitical position			1
according to the @entity172 refugee agency , as of august this year , @entity1 had received more than 30,000 refugees from @entity117 as conflict there rages , once again testing the resilience of its people			0
@entity0 's eye on series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries we profile			0
