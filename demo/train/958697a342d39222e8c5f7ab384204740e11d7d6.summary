-- having waited to be heard , @entity1 is finally speaking for herself			1
five and a half years after her roommate @entity4 was found murdered in the house they shared , the notorious @entity3 student has published her own book			1
" @entity13 " was released this week in conjunction with her first network television interview -- together a triumph of spectacle over substance			2
but it could not have been otherwise			2
this murder was transformed into tabloid entertainment almost from the moment the body was carried out of the house , in picturesque @entity19 , @entity20 , the day after @entity21			1
@entity1 concedes being ' tone - deaf ' in days after roommate 's murder @entity25 does n't know what happened that night and is unable to provide us with a single new clue that could unravel the gordian knot of police error , lies , national pride and xenophobic prejudice that turned a simple crime into an international mystery			1
since she can not offer that , her debut provides one thing only : performance			0
in her first television interview , she gave the same answers she has always given to the main questions about how she could have showered in a house with blood on a bathroom floor and faucet , and then , a few days later , named an innocent man as the killer			1
but this time the answers came with close - ups of the quivering lip and brimming eyes			0
all that emotion ca n't have distracted millions of viewers from the one thing that really matters : who did it ? @entity25 has a terribly high hurdle in winning hearts and minds			1
she must overcome the challenge that confronts anyone convicted of a gruesome killing and then released without a substitute defendant			0
millions of people believe she got away with murder			1
her other problem is the one that 's dogged her from the start			0
if you want to , you can look at her and think she is acting			0
in her first interview , she occasionally looked evasive , her gaze drifting away			0
to many people that reads as shiftiness , but it can also have any number of more benign causes , including disorientation , ptsd or the very understandable nervousness that any untrained person would feel at being interviewed by a major television anchor for a national audience			0
@entity1 says her behavior was ' tone - deaf ' after murder even in tears , she comes across as remote and cool			1
and years of coaching by attorneys still have n't prevented her from saying tone - deaf things such as expressing a desire to visit @entity94 's grave			1
she can not -- and probably never will -- provide a coherent explanation for why she named @entity4 , a demonstrably innocent man , as the killer			2
i 've always believed , based on the available descriptions of what went on in the police station before she signed a " confession " putting him and herself in the house on the night of the murder , that the @entity103 wanted the killer to be a foreign man			1
after all , they were routinely arresting @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity112 immigrants for drug and violent crimes that are increasing in what until recently was their homogeneous , walled @entity118 mountain town			0
when they saw what they thought was an appointment with an @entity109 immigrant on @entity25 's cell phone , they screamed at and browbeat her -- without ever videotaping the interrogation -- until she gave in and agreed with them			1
it 's easy to envision that scenario if you believe , as i do , that all the evidence points to her innocence			0
it 's harder to accept if you think she might have been not just callous and blithe in the weeks before the murder and the days afterward , but an actual killer			2
since she ca n't give us any real answers , was her book and her coveted interview worth all the money -- a reported $ 4 million -- and bated breath ? in the publishing world , the reaction was summed up by an editor i know : " that used to be presidential memoir money			2
" but she spent four years in prison , wrongly accused , and endured outrageous and blatantly sexist abuse at the hands of the @entity20			1
take the sickening episode , which she reveals in her book , of being stripped and given a gratuitous manual gynecological exam immediately after being arrested and before being sent to jail			2
four million bucks ca n't repair having one 's persona hijacked , remade into the likeness of a witch or a female @entity164 , and broadcast around the world			0
most of that money has probably gone to the lawyers anyway , a gaggle of men in suits , for whom greasing the wheels of justice -- even when that " justice " is really about upholding the honor of police and prosecutors who made big investigative missteps -- and getting paid take precedence over figuring out what actually happened			0
if anything was left over , it went toward hauling a middle - class @entity3 family out the debt hole into which they plunged when they double - mortgaged their houses to defend their kid			0
in the end , this tragedy is about two very provincial families , one from suburban @entity193 , one from north @entity194 , who have no idea what happened and who will never get answers , no matter how much money gets thrown around , no matter how many television interviews are granted , or books written or even court reviews concluded			0
no , they wo n't get answers until @entity4 -- whose fingerprints and dna were in the room , who is in prison for the killing and who has never denied being present while @entity94 bled to death -- explains what really happened			2
in the meantime , the lesson for those families and others like them seems to be keep your kids home and lock your doors			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity225 .			1

@entity1 publishes book , appears on tv five years after roommate was found murdered
@entity225 : @entity25 does not come across as *authentic* and has nothing new to say
@entity233 : the man who knows the truth is in prison for the murder , but focus is on @entity25
she was in prison four years , wrongly accused , demonized and endured abuse , she says
