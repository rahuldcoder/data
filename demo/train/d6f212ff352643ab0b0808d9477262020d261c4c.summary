-- for the @entity2 , justice delayed may be justice denied , but for some observers , it 's still sweet			1
a three - person panel of the @entity7 voted unanimously to issue posthumous pardons thursday to the three @entity2 who had neither already received a pardon nor had their convictions dropped , a state official said			1
thursday 's pardons " remedied a wrongdoing of social and racial injustice , " said @entity13 , assistant director for the board , in an interview with @entity0			1
the pardons were issued to @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 , the last of the nine who had been accused in the 1931 rape case , said @entity13			1
" it has taken 82 years to clear the names of the @entity2 , " said @entity26 , founder and director of the @entity28 and @entity29			1
" and today it happened			1
" in the case , nine @entity34 - @entity34 males -- ages 12 to 19 -- were accused of raping two white females on a train in @entity39 , said @entity40			1
it was during the @entity43 , and they had hopped aboard boxcars en route to @entity47 to seek work , she said			2
also on the train was a group of white males who got into a fight with the blacks and were thrown off , she said			2
the whites went to the police , who stopped the train in the town of @entity59 , outside @entity2			1
among those who were aboard the train were the two white females -- one of them 17 , the other 21 , she said			2
the older of the two had already had a brush with the law and , under the terms of her release , was not supposed to cross state lines , @entity40 said			2
" she knew if she got caught , she 'd have to go to prison , " she said			2
so , when the sheriff asked them about why they were on the train , the woman asked him if he was going to arrest her " after what they did to us , " @entity40 said			2
" he said , ' what did they do ? ' she said , ' they raped us			2
' " but @entity83 , a professor of history and creative writing at @entity86 in @entity87 , said it was not clear how the women came to make their accusations to the posse			1
when the posse stopped the train and found nine black men , they also found the two white women dressed in men 's overalls , said @entity83 , author of " stories of @entity2 " ( 1994 )			1
" thousands and thousands of people are hoboing around in search of a bread line , in search of work , " he said			2
" most of them , but hardly all of them , men			0
women dressed in work clothes so they would n't be conspicuous			0
" " my guess is they saw the nine black men , saw the two white women and they said , ' did they bother you ? ' " the women may have faced trouble for crossing state lines or for hoboing , but that is not certain , he said			0
" all we know is that somehow , at @entity59 , a charge of rape emerges and the case begins there			0
" the suspects underwent a series of trials in @entity2 and @entity125 and were found guilty each time			1
all - white juries sentenced all but the youngest to death			0
" a judge declared a mistrial in the last case , which saved their lives , " said @entity40			0
including the appeals , there were four trials and seven retrials , @entity83 said			0
when all was said and done , each of the nine spent as few as six years and as many as 19 years in jail			0
the last of the @entity2 was released in 1950 , though one of them ended up back in jail again , said @entity83			1
@entity39 dropped rape charges against five of the defendants , and the sixth , @entity149 , received a pardon from gov. @entity151 in 1976 , she said			1
the trials resulted in two landmark @entity155 @entity154 decisions -- one requiring that defendants be tried by juries of their peers , meaning blacks in their cases ; the other requiring that indigent defendants receive competent counsel			1
the three men 's relatives had been invited to attend thursday 's hearing , but none did so , @entity13 said			0
attendees at thursday 's event included @entity170 , a @entity171 state senator who sponsored @entity172 2013 - 081 , which passed this year giving the board the authority to grant posthumous pardons for convictions that occurred at least 75 years prior			1
also in attendance was a representative of gov. @entity179 and several university professors , all of whom supported the bill			0
the case helped reignite the civil rights movement after years of slumber , said @entity83			0
" @entity34 had never stopped agitating for their rights after reconstruction , but this is the beginning -- once again -- of an interracial movement for equality that had been stalled between the end of @entity193 and the beginning of the @entity43			0
" he added , " suddenly , white people who just had n't been paying attention begin to say , ' holy mackerel , they 're going to put nine @entity34 teenagers in the electric chair ? " much has changed since those days , @entity83 said , citing the nation 's first black president			0
but the criminal justice system is still not colorblind , he added			0
" sadly , our prisons are still full of youngish black people who have been falsely accused of crime			0
your chance , even to this day , of being incarcerated for something that you did n't do are still much greater if your skin is black or dark			0
" @entity211 freed from prison after murder conviction overturned			1
