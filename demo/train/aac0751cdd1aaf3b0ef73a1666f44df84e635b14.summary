two years later , @entity1 and @entity6 are moms to a mixed race @entity8 named @entity10 , whom they love " unconditionally			1
" but even that bond has n't been enough to protect them from the emotional and social challenges they admittedly , were not prepared for			1

it is things we have to go out and research and talk to people and figure out how to do as simple as a daily chore of doing your hair , " @entity1 told @entity0			2
last week , @entity1 sued @entity26 with the goal to force them to change the policies that led to the mix - up and to obtain the funds her family needs to receive ongoing counseling and relocate to a more diverse community			1

" they came back on the line and then had asked me if i had requested an @entity54 donor			2
at that point , i said no , 380 was blond - haired , blue - eyed , resembling my partner , @entity56			1
they said we believe 330 is an @entity54 donor			2
we can no longer talk to you anymore , " said @entity1			0
the mix - up stemmed from @entity26 's record - keeping procedures , according to a complaint filed in @entity64 in @entity65 , @entity66 , where the company 's main office is located			1
the sperm bank 's records are kept manually , ink - on - paper , not electronically , according to the lawsuit			1
