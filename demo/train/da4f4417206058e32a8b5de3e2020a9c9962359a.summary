@entity0 -- a search - and - rescue team on monday found the body of a missing hot air balloonist who had crashed in @entity6 three days earlier			1
acting on a tip from a witness who saw an object falling friday , authorities dispatched a helicopter in the direction she described and quickly found the body of @entity15 of @entity16 , according to @entity18 county sheriff @entity17			1
" we were relieved that we found him , " @entity17 said			2
" but that still leaves recovery			0
" teams made up of state patrol officers , forestry units , neighboring sheriff 's department personnel and volunteers scoured areas east of @entity29 in south - central @entity6 , where the balloon basket went down			1
at least seven helicopters and planes and more than 100 people on the ground participated in the difficult search , @entity17 said			0
@entity15 had taken five skydivers up in his hot air balloon around 6:45 p.m. friday when he noticed the wind picking up and realized he was driving the balloon toward a large incoming storm system , @entity17 said			1
" the storm was pulling the balloon closer towards it , so he asked the skydivers to bail out			1
he had them jump from about 5,000 feet			0
" while the five skydivers landed safely and were picked up , @entity15 and the balloon continued heading southeast and rose another 2,000 feet , @entity17 said			1
" he went up into the clouds and had radio contact with his ground crew and told them it was hailing on him , there was lightning and rain and heavy wind , " he said			0
an updraft carried @entity15 up to about 17,000 or 18,000 feet above ground before a downdraft collapsed the balloon and sent him plummeting			2
@entity15 stayed calm and talked to his ground crew on the radio the entire time he was falling			2
" i 'm in trouble			0
i do n't have anything above my head , " @entity17 recalled from accounts told to him			0
the balloonist said he was falling at 2,000 feet per minute , but an altimeter reading says he may have been falling as quickly as 60 to 90 mph , @entity17 said			2
" as he was falling , he did a countdown			0
he could n't see anything because he was in the clouds			0
but when he broke through the clouds , he said , ' i see trees , ' and that 's the last thing they heard			2
" a friend of @entity15 's called him an " accomplished balloon pilot " who had logged " many hours of safe balloon operation			1
" " he was very much a gentleman and it does n't surprise me at all that he managed the situation and had his skydiver passengers get out of the balloon for their own safety , " said @entity78 , a fellow balloon pilot			1
