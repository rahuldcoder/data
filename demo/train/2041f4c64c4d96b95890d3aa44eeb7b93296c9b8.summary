@entity0 , @entity1 -- two days after a @entity1 mayor delivered an errant comment about eating tacos to support @entity7 , some of whom are the alleged victims of police mistreatment , mayor @entity3 apparently got his wish			1
some 500 tacos were delivered to his office thursday after a @entity15 activist group called @entity16 launched a text - for - tacos campaign to draw attention to the comment , which @entity3 later apologized for			1
in the interview tuesday , a local reporter pointed out that there were no @entity15 officers on @entity0 's police force			1
" and your point being ? " @entity3 responded			0
asked what he planned to do for the @entity15 community in light of the discrimination allegations , the mayor said , " i might have tacos when i go home , i 'm not quite sure yet			2
" that set off the activist group , a local branch of the @entity38 organization , which said that anytime someone texts the word " taco " to 69866 , it will deliver a taco to the mayor on their behalf			1
they 've received more than 2,600 texts , the group said in a statement thursday			0
" the mayor has shown a total lack of respect for the constituents he has been sworn to serve to the best of his ability , " said @entity48 , spokesman for the group			0
@entity3 twice apologized for the comments , saying his words were largely a product of stress			0
still , some 500 tacos were placed inside his office ; the rest are already being rerouted to local food - assistance outlets			1
" the town of @entity0 has received an abundance of tacos as a result of the campaign initiated by the group ' @entity73 , ' " said @entity3 in a statement			1
" recognizing that there are many in need in our state , we have arranged for all of the tacos to be donated to local soup kitchens and pantries , including the @entity81 in @entity82			2
" he added that " the events of the past few days have focused our town , and my administration , on the need to deal sensitively and compassionately with the challenges currently facing our town			0
" on tuesday , @entity89 agents arrested four @entity0 police officers accused of playing a role in abuse of @entity15 residents and business owners , performing illegal searches , making false arrests and harassing immigrant rights advocates			2
the arrests are the first to stem from a federal investigation into racial profiling in the city and follow a scathing december report from the @entity102 that accused the town 's police of engaging in " discriminatory policing against @entity106			0
" @entity2 's @entity107 and @entity108 contributed to this report .			0
