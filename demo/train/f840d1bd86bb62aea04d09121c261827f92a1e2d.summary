recently i wrote about the many problems i 've encountered while trying to become a runner -- from asthma to shin splints to plantar fasciitis			1
some of you supported the idea that overcoming obstacles is the right choice , while others suggested i listen to my body and give up the idea of running altogether			1
as i 've started to lead a healthier , more active life , i 've tried to find as much information as possible related to health and fitness			1
if you 've ever tried to research any particular topic related to health , you 've probably found what i did -- information overload ! to add to the confusion , much of the information provides conflicting advice			1
this seems to be true whether you 're looking for nutritional recommendations , training programs , or even deciding what type of exercise equipment is best			2
the varied opinions , even from professional trainers and athletes , can leave your head spinning			2
why being part of a team matters given all this conflicting advice , people may fail to even start an exercise program because they 're afraid of doing something wrong			2
" how can i become healthy if i do n't really know what ' healthy ' means ? " i know i 've asked myself this very question many times over the years for example , a simple task such as finding the right running shoes can seem overwhelming			2
we encounter terms like pronation , stability and foot - strike			2
do we want more support or is a minimalist shoe best ? training programs pose their own particular brand of " in your face " information overload			2
are you training for strength or endurance ? are you best working out at a gym or at home , with free weights or weight machines ? how do you tell the difference between boot camp , @entity65 or @entity66 ? does it make a difference if you are training for a @entity70 or a marathon ? the questions you can ask yourself and the answers are endless			1
nutrition provides another source of even more conflicting advice			2
we 're all familiar with the celebrity trainers , each taking unique approaches to help you properly fuel your body			1
should you eat a meal every four hours or just make sure to eat several small meals throughout the day ? are all carbohydrates bad and all proteins good ? how do you fuel your training ? do you exercise best on minimal calories first thing in the morning ? do you prefer a later workout and a small meal a couple of hours before you hit the trails ? to say these different nutritional ideas are confusing is an understatement			0
get fit and others will follow i never really considered before i joined the @entity97 team that my needs might be unique			1
each of us responds differently , so each of us has to find the right combination of nutrients and meal times to make our workouts count			0
i 've found that i need a small meal with as little processed sugar as possible about one to two hours before i work out			0
too long before and i run out of energy ; too close and i 'm too full to work at my full potential			0
in many cases , the best plan is to minimize the information overload and focus on the simplest pathway to your goals			0
for example , the simplest nutritional advice i received was to concentrate on unprocessed , whole foods at the edge of the grocery store and keep my meals colorful with a variety of fruits and vegetables			0
it 's straightforward , easy to remember , and most importantly , easy to understand			1
we also need the right equipment to make that training count			0
most of us have a local running store ( or cycling shop or gym ) where the experts can offer their guidance			0
with their help , you can try a few options and find out what works best for you			0
how to make your workout seem shorter if you do have a particular health - related concern , your first stop should be your physician 's office			1
your doctor can help you cut through the conflicting advice and decide what plan may work best for you			1
my physician knows about my training program and has helped advise me how to prevent certain problems that could derail my progress			0
the jungle of information should not stop you from pursuing a healthier life			0
i 've found that there is no one - size - fits - all prescription for success and health			1
variation and experimentation are the keys to discovering what options work best for you			0
i decided it 's my responsibility to learn as much as possible so that i can give myself every opportunity to succeed , but i wo n't let conflicting information slow me down			1
are the choices i make and the program i follow right for everyone ? maybe not , but they are right for me right now			0
as long as i keep learning , listening to my body and making informed decisions , i hope to keep training and continue on my journey to lead a healthier life			1
