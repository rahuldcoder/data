the service 's @entity31 's " vivid description of the destruction wrought by war echoes the personal experiences of so many people in this country amid the terrible ravages of the civil war , " @entity2 said in the @entity3 , which was broadcast by @entity27 , a @entity0 affiliate in @entity4			1
" how true it is that war can destroy everything of value : families , whole communities , the fruit of men 's labor			0
" @entity2 also expressed " deep sorrow " at the death of two women killed in a stampede at one of his events in @entity4 on saturday , papal spokesman father @entity47 said			1

they prayed over the dead bodies and met with the family of the one victim who has been identified , a catechism teacher in a parish in @entity66 whose last class was saturday morning			0
@entity70 through the @entity3 , a long line of worshippers brought offerings to the pontiff , as an electric organ and guitar played a joyous tune over the sound of percussion instruments and a choir , members of which were wearing matching white baseball caps			2
women carried local produce on their heads in wide baskets or tall jugs , many dancing to the music as they waited to meet the pope			0
the 81 - year - old pontiff mopped his face with a white handkerchief several times during the outdoor service , while many worshippers sought shelter from the sun under umbrellas			0

@entity7 is the last continent that @entity2 had left to visit , and one he could not avoid , said @entity106 , a biographer of the pope			1
" he knows he has to do this			0
he knows @entity7 is the future of the [ @entity111 ] @entity110 , as it is for all of @entity112 , " said @entity106			2
@entity112 , like @entity113 , is on the rise in @entity7 and @entity115 , even as the northern hemisphere tends to become more secular			2

" @entity129 loved the travel and loved the different cultures			0
@entity2 is a @entity132 through and through			2
" but @entity2 understands that travel has become an essential part of a pope 's duties , said @entity106 , the author of " @entity137 : pope @entity2 and his battle with the @entity139			1

@entity7 has been hit harder by @entity147 and @entity148 than any other region of the world , according to the @entity151 and @entity152			0
there has been fierce debate between those who advocate the use of condoms to help stop the spread of the epidemic and those who oppose it			0
@entity106 said this week 's visit may be @entity2 's only trip to @entity7			1
