@entity0 , @entity1 -- " how you doin ' darlin ' ? where you from ? i know there 's a storm that passed through , but we still got ta eat ! " and with a big smile that said " thanks for the tip ! " the crowd - pleasing trumpet player continued to woo tourists in front of @entity15			1
it 's just another day in the @entity17 -- but it 's also just days since the first major hurricane hit @entity0 since @entity19			1
have no doubt , as far as tourism is concerned , @entity0 is up and running and ready as ever to welcome visitors			1
business owners and community leaders say the speedy recovery from @entity26 is thanks to smart leadership , strong lines of communication and serious preparation			1
" the really great news coming out of this is that everything 's working so well : all the billions spent on the levees and the gates -- it all seems to be working , " said @entity35 , co-proprietor of restaurant icon @entity36 , located in the city 's @entity37			1
@entity35 is n't complaining too much about the power outage and the physical damage from @entity26			1
she 's not happy about losing a week 's business , but she says there 's not even enough damage to bother her insurance agent this time around			1
how a @entity0 native rides out a storm " i 'm gon na have to take the hit myself -- and i 'm the happiest girl in town about that , " she laughed			1
" after @entity19 we were closed for 13 months and it was 6Â½ million dollars to get back open again			1
" in addition to keeping more detailed records on employees , including cell phones and home addresses , @entity35 said @entity62 's also has an internal website for companywide communication in case of emergency and generators to keep the 10,000 - plus bottle wine cellar functioning in case of a loss of power			2
that was n't the case in 2005 , when about 7,500 bottles were shipped out of town before the storm hit			1
since @entity19 , the company has also set up a way to process its payroll remotely			1
post-isaac diners at @entity62 's may see an abbreviated menu at first , because some items , such as turtle soup , involve preparation that can take a few days to perfect			2
but in fairly short order , " you wo n't even know there 's been a storm , " said @entity35			2
storm evidence was easier to see at @entity90 on the riverfront , where a plate glass window was blown out and parts of the roof were damaged or blown away			2
but president and ceo @entity96 is confident that damages from @entity26 will be repaired soon			1
@entity90 produces the colorful floats that fill the streets of @entity0 during that revered holiday -- and those floats are pulled with the help of generators -- a fact that bodes well for the company during a hurricane			2
after @entity19 those generators were being used " anywhere and everywhere " said @entity96 , including by police and fire stations			1
this time , the 130 generators were ready for double duty , but only a few had to be sent out to help other locations that lost power			2
" we deal with these storms the way they deal with snowstorms and earthquakes in other parts of the country , " said @entity96 , pointing out that none of downtown , the @entity17 or the museum and arts district suffered power outages from @entity26			1
the tourism business has been " spectacular " this year and @entity26 is a " blip on the screen , " he said			1
" @entity0 moves to the beat of its own drummer			2
there are more restaurants and more tourist attractions and more venues for parties and events than we 've ever had in the @entity0 , " @entity96 said			1
@entity140 since 1932 , @entity90 and @entity139 have seen plenty of hurricanes			2
@entity143 has always been key to recovery			2
" i have guys here who are artists , who are up on the roof helping the roof get patched , " said @entity96 , whose company also produces elaborate floats for parades around the world			2
" the fact that we 're already up and operating says a lot			2
the storm was on wednesday and we 're open for business on friday			1
that 's pretty darn good ! " business as usual is also the mantra at another @entity0 dining institution , @entity161 's on @entity162			1
" it lasted a day longer than we thought it would , " said president and ceo @entity164 , but he said they 're expecting a good crowd and there are " considerable " reservations for the @entity169			0
friday lunchtime at @entity173 's generally means a packed house , but on the friday after the storm , there was a rare sighting at @entity173 's : empty tables			0
one regular customer , @entity179 , said that those empty tables were an indication that " the word 's obviously not gotten out yet ! normally the roar of the crowd here is louder than the roar of a hurricane , " he said			0
@entity164 , who is also chairman of the board of the city 's convention center , said that @entity169 is n't really a big deal in the big picture of @entity0 tourism			1
he called @entity169 a " line in the sand " that takes the city out of the slower summer season and into the more intense time of year for visitors			1
" we 're getting ready for a busy , bustling season come the middle to the end of september			0
" in terms of numbers , 2012 could break a key record for @entity0 : there 's " a distinct possibility " that visitor numbers will reach pre-katrina numbers for the first time , @entity164 said			0
the city saw 10.1 million visitors in 2004 , he said			0
" we 're going to get close to that 10 million mark again , if we do n't exceed it			0
" another positive indicator is a 57 percent occupancy rate at the convention center			0
by comparison , the rate was 44 percent in 2004 , @entity219 , and 47 percent in 2011			0
" we broke 50 percent occupancy three out of the last four years , " which is a sign of excellent convention bookings , he said			0
a short walk away from @entity224 's , @entity225 at the @entity226 on @entity227 was busy preparing to re-hang paintings on the yellow and brick walls in his long entrance hallway			0
" this is usually filled with paintings , " he said			0
he took them all down in preparation for the storm , but then faced another challenge : the man who was supposed to come in and help him hang them back up was stranded on the other side of the @entity241 in a home with no power			0
but @entity225 is optimistic about the future and has no doubt the tourists will keep coming , not only the usual visitors seeking @entity0 music and culture , but also the growing numbers of travelers who arrive via cruise ship , adding yet another set of faces to the @entity0 tourism crowd			1
at @entity257 , also on @entity227 , @entity256 says she was happy to come to work because there 's air conditioning -- unlike at her home , where power has yet to be restored			0
in @entity265 , the tourists , the colorful characters and the music were out in full force			0
@entity267 is stationed at the @entity268 in @entity269 , @entity1 , but he 's on leave this week and was touring @entity0 for the very first time			0
" i 've never been here			0
so the fun part is seeing all this ( he motions toward the band playing nearby and a gold - painted mime " frozen " on the corner ) , but then also seeing all of the crazy clean - up going on too at the same time			0
we were watching the weather closely and i did n't think we were gon na be able to do this			0
" but @entity267 's leave was approved thursday and he made the trip down with no problems			0
his friend @entity284 says the " normal @entity0 attitude " is going strong and she 's excited to show him all the hot spots in the @entity17			0
" we 've been walking down @entity162 and later i 'm going to take him to get his first beignet , " she said , right before they popped inside @entity15			0
@entity35 is expecting " one heck of a great fall " -- and winter , with the @entity291 coming back to the @entity0 for the first time since 2002			1
" and by the way , we only need one team to fly in for that , " she said , " because we 've got the other one ( the @entity300 ) in town			0

businesses hit hard by @entity19 are breathing a sigh of relief
some business owners in tourist areas are repairing relatively minor damage
@entity26 is " a blip on the screen " of a great year for tourism , one owner says
