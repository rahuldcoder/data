( editor 's note : @entity2 is executive director of @entity3 , a @entity5 - based nonprofit working with widows , orphans and the disabled in @entity9			1
she spent her teenage years in @entity10 , where she now lives with her family			0
for more information about @entity3 , read here and here @entity2 says the real @entity9 is more textured than could be seen from secure bunkers			1
@entity10 , @entity9 ( @entity16 ) -- in my @entity9 , the days are compiled images of @entity9 living their simple lives			1
my @entity9 is a kaleidoscope of real people , from the stick - thin bearded @entity23 man , an imposing 6 - foot - 5 , rhythmically lifting rocks , 12 hours a day , seven days a week for $ 4 a day , his shalwar kameez billowing in the hot summer breezes ; to the grin of the boy in his blue shirt as he labors to cut the alfalfa after school to feed the flock of big - bottomed sheep			1
to the kiss of the old widow , her family gone , whose feet hurt incessantly ; she 's forgotten the @entity37 she once knew when she worked for the government			0
and of course , to the communities my organization works with to help them better their lives through direct education and training programs			0
a @entity46 orphan , about 11 , enters my office with a plate of freshly picked summer apricots			0
he was rescued from a madrassa that trained him how to throw grenades and to be a suicide bomber			0
he spends time with me when he gets a chance , tidying my desk , pulling my papers out of the copier and stacking them			0
we ca n't speak much as i do not know @entity46 and he has n't yet learned @entity58 or @entity37 , but he tucks his head into the crook of my neck for a couple of minutes watching me type			2
in these gentle moments , he begins to unwind and i experience the fragile connection that is being created between our worlds			0
living and working in @entity9 for nearly five years now , i do not recognize most of what the international news accounts of this area report as anything remotely close to my experience			1
a visiting journalist recently observed with some surprise that " parts of @entity9 are at war and parts are peaceful			1
" indeed , like @entity78 and many other sites of civil unrest in the world , there are pockets of peace and pockets of war			1
the things that concern me most as i go about my day - to - day activities are not suicide bombers , kidnappings , and the " insurgency			0
" these are all just a backdrop to the much more textured story that is @entity9 , though it rarely touches the lives of the 2,500 or so foreign aid workers who live and work in @entity10			1
yet these stories of violence dominate the news outside and thus color the way the world imagines @entity9			1
internationals living in the country are constantly bombarded with " threat alerts " and rarely visit the desperately poor @entity9 communities their projects are ostensibly attempting to help			1
this is what concerns me : how my country is spending development dollars here without really being here			0
the results of the fear that dominates the management of most development projects are an incompletely informed group of international professionals working in @entity9 who can literally spend years here without seeing the country but through the windows of their armored cars			1
living as they do under cloistered , fearful conditions behind razor - wired walls , venturing out only to a select list of " secure " locations , they make often questionable decisions on spending , frequently without the input of @entity9 nationals			1
from this entrenched , isolated position , they are managing hundreds of millions of dollars of international development funds			0
when news reports talk about @entity9 's high levels of corruption , they do not lift the veils to see that the development projects themselves are actually enabling it with security conditions that resemble apartheid			2
while folks at home are hunkering down , @entity9 projects are concerned with tripling their monthly " burn rates " and managing projects remotely -- projects that almost certainly are less than the books indicate , or worse , have been paid for several times over by different organizations			1
it is time for those controlling the funding investment in this country to listen to their citizens , especially @entity9 - @entity154 and other @entity154 like me and my family who live and work here			2
we are the people on the front lines , and connected as we are to the community here , we have much to offer in the way of supporting the success of the donor efforts			0
the good news is that there are more than a few @entity154 in this country who have the privilege of experiencing the @entity9 people the way i do			1
but so far , my attempts to connect them with the @entity154 mission here as the new administration " rethinks " the strategy for @entity9 have been unsuccessful as calls and e-mails to the ambassador have gone unanswered			2
there is a story of a young @entity154 worker for a nongovernmental organization who stopped on the road recently to pull out a van that was stuck in the snow , having veered into the oncoming lane when the sun was going down			2
in the car were two women , three small children and an elderly man , plus the two men who were attempting to dig out the wheels with sticks			0
it took less than 10 minutes to pull them out , and they were grateful for the help ... they 'd been there for nearly four hours and many trucks and security vehicles had passed them without offering a helping hand			0
they thought they would either freeze or be pushed over the brink of the cliff once it darkened			0
i know that story is true because the young man is my son @entity211 and i was with him			2
i propose a simple and very @entity9 solution to the @entity9 dilemma : we need to be good neighbors			2
take some risks to communicate with ordinary people			0
my young @entity46 orphan , trained to kill , is now growing up in an institution where he mixes with internationals , with the very " infidels " he was previously conditioned to hate			0
... are these not the ways for us to build bridges into this community ? with shared meals instead of divisive policies ? these are not new thoughts , but they are often unspoken and certainly not practiced in @entity154 's @entity9 , which is a world divided by sandbags , concrete t - beams and armed guards			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : @entity9 is a complex place with pockets of war and peace
she says the image of @entity9 provided in the media is n't complete
she says some aid organizations hide behind fences and miss the real story
@entity2 : we must build bridges to the young people of @entity9
