( @entity233 ) word to the @entity235 @entity236 , @entity22 : a word to the @entity235 ... segregation ( noun ) the separation of people or groups , especially by race source : www.dictionary.com together at last @entity27 : @entity245 was a policy that was practiced in many schools across @entity100 before a @entity249 ruling declared it unconstitutional			0
in @entity6 , @entity7 , many students from the class of 1959 recently attended their 50th reunion			1
and they decided that while their schools were segregated then , they wanted to come together now			0
( begin video ) @entity259 , @entity0 correspondent : there are the nametags , the nerves , the hugs of recognition			0
but a typical 50th high school reunion this is not			1

@entity271 , 1959 graduate , @entity273 : i grew up in a town for 50 years with all those people around and never knew who they were			0
in 1959 , the southern city 's three public high schools -- @entity282 , @entity283 and @entity284 -- were segregated			1
in the 1950s , @entity286 laws ruled , and separate was supposedly equal			0
but as a @entity290 alumna , as a young child , she says segregation was simply a way of life			0
@entity294 : we did n't find out that we were being discriminated against until we were in high school , until that high school teacher told us that we were living in a segregated society			1
we did n't know it			0
@entity278 : fifty years later , @entity301 alumnus @entity300 , former @entity0 president and publisher of the " @entity303 , " had an idea to close the five - decade gap			2

we were divided by policies , politics , and tradition			0
it is a different world today			2
we no longer are separated except by personal choice			0
" that letter and several months of planning later , 210 members of the class of 1959 sat together at last			2
@entity318 , 1959 graduate , @entity273 : well , the old saying is better late than never			2
i could not sleep last night			0
so , it just means the world to me			0
it was just like waiting for @entity324 to come			0
@entity325 , 1959 graduate , @entity327 : i realized how much we actually missed , people that we could have known			0
@entity278 : for this former class president , the gathering of old and new friends brings tears to her eyes , not just because of the symbolism , but for the empty seats , classmates whose attitudes on race 50 years later have n't changed			1
@entity341 : there are some people that still feel resistant to the idea and think that what we 're pushing for is not a good thing			0
and i think we have to focus on the ones that were here today			2
i think those people went away with a changed heart			0
@entity278 : it may have taken those people 50 years to come together			0
unlike these old - fashioned photos , their story is no longer told in black and white			2
