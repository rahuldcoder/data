@entity0 -- the pace of the 2012 race for the @entity4 kicks into high gear wednesday night , with the first of three @entity8 presidential debates scheduled over the next 15 days			0
and while it 's the fourth @entity10 debate so far this cycle , it 's the first to include @entity12 gov. @entity11 , who jumped into the race for the @entity4 less than one month ago			1
joining @entity11 on the stage at the @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , will be former @entity19 gov. @entity18 , who 's making his second bid for the @entity10 nomination , rep. @entity22 of @entity12 , who 's making third run for the @entity4 , rep. @entity26 of @entity27 , former house speaker @entity28 , businessman and former talk show host @entity30 , former sen. @entity32 of @entity33 , and former @entity34 and former @entity36 ambassador to @entity37 @entity25			1
five of the candidates -- @entity18 , @entity22 , @entity39 , @entity26 and @entity30 -- met monday at the @entity40 in @entity41 , @entity42			0
@entity11 was scheduled to attend , but canceled to return home to deal with the wildfires burning across @entity12			1
@entity11 's entry into the race last month has dramatically altered the landscape , with the @entity12 governor on the top of the pack according to six major national polls released in the last three weeks			1
@entity18 , the former front - runner in the polls , has now be relegated to second place in the surveys			2
the three debates this month and two more next month will be major tests for @entity11 , who does n't have a lot of recent experience debating political rivals			1
while the spotlight will be on the @entity12 governor , it will also be shining on @entity18			0
the question for the former @entity19 governor : does he attack @entity11 's record , or does he keep his line of fire directed at president @entity69 ? @entity26 's mission in the debates : try to grab back the spotlight that @entity11 grabbed from her on the day of her biggest victory			2
the @entity12 governor announced his candidacy on august 13 , just a few hours before @entity26 won a crucial @entity10 presidential straw poll in @entity78 , @entity79			1
for the rest of the candidates on the stage , the objective is to show relevancy			0
this week 's debate is followed by a @entity1 / @entity10 presidential debate monday in @entity87 , @entity88 , with another debate in @entity88 on september 22			2
a @entity91 debate on october 11 is followed a week later by a @entity1 debate in @entity93 , @entity94 , on october 18			0
