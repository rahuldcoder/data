@entity0 -- it reads like something from a spy novel			1
an @entity8 agent known for his mathematical genius and codebreaking talent is found dead at his home , his naked body padlocked inside a large red carrying bag stowed in the bathtub			1
there is no sign of a break - in or of force having been used against him			0
the man 's internet history betrays an interest in sex games and bondage			1
but dna traces suggest other people may have been in his apartment			0
the mysterious 2010 death of @entity28 , who worked for @entity30 's foreign intelligence service , is a riddle that has gripped the nation			1
and at the heart of the mystery is a key question : could @entity28 have zipped himself into the bag as part of a bizarre sexual fantasy ? or was the @entity40 - educated math whiz placed there by what family members have suggested are killers versed in the " dark arts " of espionage ? at @entity46 , a solid red - brick building across the @entity48 from the headquarters of @entity8 -- where fictional spy @entity50 worked -- the disturbing tale of the final hours of a man known for closely guarding his privacy has unfolded in the most public of ways			1
the inquest has heard that @entity28 was not reported missing for more than a week , despite the sensitive nature of his work , meaning many vital clues were lost to decomposition			2
meanwhile , @entity30 media have focused on revelations about the 31 - year - old 's apparent interest in bondage and claustrophilia , a fetish for enclosure in very confined spaces			1
reports about the " body in a bag spy " detail how two experts spent days trying to figure out whether @entity28 , who was athletic and of medium height , could have contorted himself in such as way as to lock himself into the @entity78 holdall bag , with a key to the padlock inside			1
@entity81 provided to the court shows one of them , @entity85 , folding himself laboriously into an identical bag , measuring just 32 inches by 19 inches ( 81 by 48 centimeters ) , placed in a bathtub			2
@entity85 , who specializes in rescuing people from confined spaces , told the inquest he had tried to lock himself into the bag 300 times without success , according to the @entity95 news agency			0
a second expert witness , also of a size and build similar to @entity28 , tried 100 times to re-enact the feat without succeeding			2
but neither ruled out definitively the possibility @entity28 could have somehow done it alone			0
a small trace of someone else 's dna was found on the bag , helping spawn all kinds of theories -- that he was perhaps drugged by a foreign spy who then locked him in the bag , or was the victim of a kinky sexual liaison gone wrong			1
the detail that the closets in @entity28 ' central @entity0 flat contained thousands of dollars ' worth of designer women 's clothing and shoes , some of which had been worn , as well as women 's wigs and cosmetics , added fuel to the fire of speculation			1
another revelation came from a former landlord and landlady , who told how they had once found @entity28 tied by his wrists to the headboard of his bed , after he shouted for help			1
@entity28 said he had wanted to see if he could get free , landlady @entity133 told the court , but she and her husband " thought it to be more likely to be sexual than escapology , " according to @entity95			1
@entity28 was recruited into the intelligence services straight from university , working with @entity140 before @entity8			2
the nature of his work and questions around why his spy agency bosses took so long to raise an alert about his absence have added to the intrigue surrounding his death			0
in a courtroom scene reminiscent of a spy thriller , his boss testified from behind a screen and was identified only as @entity153 -- the @entity8 being the official name for @entity8			0
she apologized to @entity28 ' family for the service 's failure to act sooner , but said his lifestyle choices were not a concern for the agency , suggesting it has moved on from the rigid mores of past decades , when closet homosexuality or illicit affairs opened up possibilities for blackmail			1
" there is no set template for what their lifestyle should be , " @entity153 said of today 's intelligence agents , according to the @entity95			2
" individuals have lifestyle and sexual choices and sexual preferences which are perfectly legitimate			0
" she acknowledged that @entity28 had made a number of unauthorized computer searches at work but played down the significance of this fact , the agency said			0
@entity28 was finally reported missing by a co-worker on august 23 , more than a week after the normally punctilious employee had last shown up at work			0
a transcript of the call to police said @entity28 was last spoken to on friday , august 13 , and that calls to his home number and cell phone had gone unanswered			2
his sister had also been unable to reach him			0
the caller mentioned that @entity28 had " recently been pulled off of a job " and said it was unclear if he might have " taken this badly			0
" the family 's lawyer accused @entity8 of showing " total disregard for @entity28 's whereabouts and safety " before he was found dead at his government - provided home , @entity95 reported			1
concerns over national security have been a factor in the 20 - month delay in holding @entity28 ' inquest , and an agency more used to working in the shadows has had an uncomfortably bright light shone into its practices			0
as well as adding to his family 's distress , the initial delay in reporting @entity28 ' death means forensic specialists simply can not answer many of the most pressing questions			1
testing did not give conclusive results because the body had decomposed significantly after nine days in the summer heat of his top - floor apartment , toxicology reports posted online say			0
traces of alcohol and a chemical matching the party drug ghb were found , but both can occur naturally as part of the decomposition process , one document says			0
@entity28 was teetotal , so " even a small amount of alcohol could affect cognitive capacity , " it notes			0
a series of photographs provided by the @entity239 show the tidy , impersonal interior of the spy 's @entity242 home and the small , white - tiled bathroom where his body was found			1
a bicycle parked in the hallway is a clue to @entity28 ' more regular passion , cycling			0
a glimpse through the bedroom door shows a bed half - made , clothes lying on it			0
but little else can be gleaned from the images			0
media reports have homed in on expert testimony that despite @entity28 ' solitary lifestyle , tiny traces of @entity261 from " at least two " other people were found in his apartment			2
but who those visitors were and whether they hold the clue to the riddle of the agent 's mysterious death are yet more questions that remain unanswered			1
@entity28 ' family , with whom he was close , deny that he was gay or had a secret , unorthodox sex life			2
they believe someone else was there either when @entity28 died or afterward , their lawyer , @entity278 , told a hearing held before the inquest began , and they suspect some degree of expert cover - up was involved			2
" the impression of the family is that the unknown third party was a member of some agency specializing in the dark arts of the secret services -- or evidence has been removed post-mortem by experts in the dark arts , " @entity278 said , according to @entity95			1
the inquest court is expected to give its verdict on @entity28 ' death this week , but the final chapter of his life in the shadows may never be fully revealed to his family , or the @entity30 public .			1

@entity28 ' naked body was found in a locked bag in the bathtub of his @entity0 home
