@entity0 -- @entity2 battled cervical cancer in 2012			2
a year later , the @entity5 native feels that narrowly qualifying for a @entity7 - sponsored program for low - income and uninsured female cancer patients saved her life			1
she now wants her governor and state legislature to support an expansion of @entity7 -- part of president @entity16 's @entity15 -- that she feels could save the lives of thousands of other women in her state by helping them detect diseases much earlier			1
but if @entity5 lawmakers have their way -- as well as governors and legislatures in @entity27 , @entity28 and nearly a dozen other states -- low - income americans like @entity2 may not have expanded access to funds needed for such procedures			1
those states feel the expansion is an unnecessary government overreach at a time when spending should be limited , not expanded			1
still , for some , the impact on their lives is very real			0
government reverses plan to cut @entity44 rate " if i had @entity7 expansion , i would have found a doctor sooner than later , " said @entity2			1
at 60 , she was too young to qualify for @entity44 and said she was also told she did n't qualify for traditional @entity7 treatment available to women of childbearing age			1
" as soon as i felt ill , i would have gone to go check			0
" instead , @entity2 said , her tumor went unchecked for months , growing to the size of a grapefruit			0
eventually an oncologist , working largely on a pro bono basis , properly diagnosed @entity2 as having stage 1 cervical cancer and helped her find health coverage under a @entity7 provision mandating treatment for women with breast and cervical cancer			1
the catch : the program was only available to women who were n't already covered by insurance or @entity7			1
" it saved my life , it actually saved my life , " @entity2 said of the treatment she received			0
political rising stars in @entity5 , like their counterparts in nearly half the country , are drawing partisan battle lines over extending federally subsidized health care to more than a million of the state 's poorest residents			1
this week , a @entity5 showdown pitted gov. @entity79 against @entity81 favorites the @entity83 brothers -- @entity84 rep. @entity83 and @entity86 mayor @entity85 -- in dueling press conferences on expanding @entity7 under the @entity15			1
" i 'm a self - employed artist and the mother of a 3 - year - old and i 'm not eligible to receive @entity7			1
private health insurance is not an option , " @entity90 , who spoke at the @entity83 rally , said later			0
" there are a lot of people who are working really hard			0
they are n't being lazy , they just do n't have the means for extra insurance			0
it 's about trying to provide for your family			0
" the faceoff was equal parts an ideological fight over the merits of @entity15 and a foreshadowing of how that policy will influence high - stakes political races			1
" @entity7 expansion is a misguided , and ultimately doomed , attempt to mask the shortcomings of @entity15 , " said @entity79 , a former @entity111 presidential candidate who is thought to be considering another run for the @entity113 in 2016			1
" it would benefit no one in our state to see their taxes skyrocket and our economy crushed as our budget crumbled under the weight of oppressive @entity7 costs			1
" " governor , being tough on people with no health insurance wo n't win you the @entity111 presidential primary in 2016 , " @entity83 wrote in a @entity128 op - ed. " it definitely wo n't win you the presidency			2
" @entity137 gov. @entity136 , a @entity138 , unleashed a similarly blistering critique of his @entity111 counterpart in @entity28 , @entity140 , in remarks to a @entity81 conference in @entity143 last month			0
@entity136 attacked @entity140 , who is up for re-election next year , as a " tea party @entity111 " who cares more about voter id laws than expanding health care access and education for @entity28			0
then there 's the plight of politicians like @entity27 gov. @entity152 , a @entity111 , who endorsed expanding @entity7 in his state using federal dollars in @entity27 , only to be met with opposition by fellow @entity111 in the @entity27 's legislature			1
@entity152 , who campaigned heavily against @entity16 's health care law in 2010 , said he would accept the federal dollars last month , but his state 's @entity111 - controlled legislature has since opposed the move			2
" it 's creating the same type of tensions among many conservatives that are taking place at the national level , at state level , " said @entity162 , a @entity163 historian and @entity1 contributor			0
" you have a lot of governors who have national aspirations and have a huge incentive not to reject those funds			0
... then there are conservative legislators who have no national aspirations who are sticking to their position			0
" the @entity184 ruled last year that states can opt out of broadening @entity7 coverage , striking down one of the provisions of the @entity15			1
since then , about half of the states have said they 'll opt in to expanded @entity7			1
nearly a quarter say they wo n't participate , with the remaining quarter still on the fence , according to figures from the @entity197 , a policy consulting firm			2
" things got much more complicated , " @entity198 , a senior fellow at the nonprofit @entity199 and former head of the @entity201 , said of the @entity184 ruling			0
" there are now many more options where states can customize			2
... in states where they are more politically ambivalent , it becomes more complicated			2
" @entity111 governors in at least eight states have agreed to @entity7 expansion , which would extend coverage to all adults with income below 138 % of the poverty line			1
it 's part of the @entity16 administration 's push for universal insurance , and the federal government is dangling a big carrot to make it happen			0
it will cover each state 's expansion costs in full for the first three years			2
after that , states will be responsible for no more than 10 % of the tab			2
some of the states that have decided to opt out have some of the highest uninsured rates in the nation			2
take , for example , @entity5 , where nearly a quarter of the residents are uninsured			2
some 1.75 million adults would be newly eligible if the state joins in			0
it stands to gain $ 25.3 billion in federal funds over four years to insure poor adults , while spending $ 1.3 billion , according to the @entity239 , an advocacy group for low - income @entity240			1
the @entity242 said @entity7 expansion would prove costly to the tune of " tens of billions in combined state and federal funds over the next 10 years			1
" still , in the end , the pushback against expansion may amount to just that , political experts said			1
" if you 're betting , you bet that in the end they 're going to take the money			0
the states need money and this would cover a large amount of people , " @entity162 said , adding that the holdouts will face mounting opposition both within and outside of their party			2
" part of it will come from moderate @entity111 who do n't want to have a party painted as extremists			0
part of it will come from needs of the electorate because there is a great need			0
" people like @entity2 and @entity90 say lawmakers had better pay heed to that need			0
" i feel frustrated because as a citizen because i do n't feel supported by my leaders , " @entity90 said			0
@entity1 's @entity277 , @entity278 and @entity279 contributed to this report			0

half of states will expand @entity7 under @entity15 ; half refuse or are on the fence
low - income citizens and their advocates say @entity7 expansion necessary
states like @entity5 , @entity27 say a @entity7 expansion is costly and will fail
politics at play and most states will eventually expand the program , political experts say
