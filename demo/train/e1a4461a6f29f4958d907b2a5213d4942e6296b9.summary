@entity0 -- the controversial @entity3 tv network @entity2 has bought current tv , gaining access to millions more @entity7 viewers and taking a major step forward in cracking the longed - for @entity7 market			1
the move is the network 's crowning achievement in the @entity7 after years struggling to be accepted in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks , when @entity2 was vilified by the @entity16 administration for broadcasting the notorious @entity18 videos and other @entity20 material			1
read more : once called ' terror network , ' @entity21 dares to enter @entity7 cable market but following the @entity7 military withdrawal from @entity27 , @entity7 relations with the channel improved			0
recently @entity2 's @entity29 - language channel has won several prestigious industry awards , as well as plaudits from senior @entity7 policy - makers such as @entity33			1
the @entity34 reports that @entity2 paid $ 500 million for @entity35 , a huge sum by tv industry standards and a big investment at a time when many rival news networks are cutting back on news bureaus and staff			0
but it 's peanuts when one remembers that the man behind the network , the emir of @entity3 , @entity45 , is sitting on one of the world 's fastest - growing economies and the world 's third largest gas reserves			2
from his point of view , rehabilitating @entity2 's image in @entity7 was never going to come cheaply and at least now @entity2 can access more of the highly lucrative @entity7 cable tv market			1
but this was never about the money			0
@entity3 's priority is drumming up international support in case of another major crisis in the @entity62 that threatens its wealth and independence , like for example a war with @entity67 or an imploding @entity68			1
having studied at @entity70 's @entity69 and spent years as @entity3 's minister of defense the emir knows that military defense of his tiny country is impossible			1
the @entity7 is @entity3 's ultimate security guarantee and any chance to buy trust with the @entity7 people represents an excellent opportunity to secure his country 's future further			1
compared to the tens of billions his neighbors spend on @entity7 arms , the influence afforded by @entity2 represents very good value for money			2
another important aim behind developing @entity2 in the @entity7 is to try and present a different , more positive image of @entity92 and @entity93 generally to @entity7 than the one they are used to seeing			1
the emir is proudly @entity92 and @entity95 , just like @entity2 , and the channel sends a clear message to the @entity98 that there is more to the @entity92 world than terrorism , religious extremism and oil - rich slobs			0
whether the wider @entity7 public will buy into this vision however or indeed watch the new channel at all remains to be seen			0
@entity2 sets its sights on @entity7 given the popularity of @entity111 among @entity7 already , the channel evidently has many @entity7 fans besides @entity33			2
but as a rule the wider @entity7 audience is not very interested in foreign affairs , even without the complication of associations with terrorism and the wrong kind of political @entity93			0
even closely related foreign broadcasters , like the @entity121 , have had trouble getting a toehold in the popular @entity7 tv market , let alone @entity3 ones			1
what makes @entity2 different and gives it its competitive edge in the @entity7 is its perspective on foreign affairs , its freedom to operate , and its enormous financial resources			0
@entity2 's @entity29 output has a much freer rein than many other news channels , including many western ones			2
even the flagship @entity137 service , which has a much stronger political impact in the region as it broadcasts in @entity140 , has to temper its coverage of the @entity62 on occasions when there is a conflict with other @entity3 interests			0
lots of state - sponsored channels broadcast news channels around the world , mostly from the @entity7 and @entity150 in the direction of the " @entity152			0
" but @entity111 , and soon @entity21 , broadcast in the opposite direction , will give quite a different perspective on events to @entity7 news channels , especially when it comes to @entity92 affairs			0
in particular @entity2 's reporting on the @entity162 - @entity161 conflict is both more in depth and in line with the rest of the world 's thinking than that usually found on @entity169			2
@entity21 will reportedly focus on @entity7 current affairs , but as in @entity171 where @entity2 was effectively shut down by pro-israeli groups , future controversy over this issue is to be expected and there will undoubtedly be many more hurdles for the network ahead			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity180 .			0
