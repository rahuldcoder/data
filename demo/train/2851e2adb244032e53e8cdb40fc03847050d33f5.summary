-- as air crash investigators pick over the wreckage of flight qv301 -- the @entity5 plane that crashed in bad weather on tuesday with 50 people on board -- concerns over air safety are growing as the number of flights in @entity13 increases			1
a steep rise in air traffic in countries like @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 -- fueled by a boom in tourism -- means domestic air regulators are having to contend with creaking infrastructure and a lack of experience in maintaining internationally recognized standards			1
@entity18 has a patchy record on air safety , logging 30 fatal air accidents since the 1950s according to the @entity30 , though data shows things have started to improve in the past decade			2
the story in other emerging markets in @entity13 tells a similar story			2
both the @entity36 and @entity38 's @entity37 have issued travel warnings directly related to the aviation industry in @entity17 -- also known as @entity17 -- following an incident in 2012 , when an @entity43 plane carrying more than 60 passengers crashed on christmas day			0
the @entity36 has warned travelers to keep in mind @entity17 's sometimes shadowy record regarding its civil aviation report card			0
" the safety records of @entity17 's domestic airlines are not open to the public , nor is public information available concerning the @entity17 government 's oversight of domestic airlines , " it says on its website			2
but @entity17 aims to change that by setting its sights on the release of a national civil aviation policy to prepare for the traffic boom that threatens to overwhelm its inadequate air transport infrastructure			1
government forecasts predict annual visitors to rise to six million in 2017 from its current 1.5 million annually , and its fast growing airline industry has received applications from four airlines owned by @entity17 nationals , adding to the seven domestic carriers currently			0
@entity70 , an aviation analyst with ratings agency @entity71 's , said standards differed dramatically across the @entity13 region			2
" it varies from country to country and airline to airline			0
in first world countries , @entity81 @entity80 and @entity82 , there are few concerns about the safety of aviation because they 've had a long track record , " @entity70 told @entity0			0
" but then you have developing markets in @entity91 and @entity92 -- and @entity17 is another country which is up and coming -- where it 's really up to the operators to keep abreast with different maintenance and training requirements			1
" increasingly with the growth of low - cost airlines in the region , there will be issues surrounding safety especially in countries that are well known for safety			2
" he said infrastructure in @entity17 would be under strain if it did n't keep pace with the growth of the market			1
overcrowding is already an issue in @entity17 where of the 600,000 people who visited @entity17 by air last year , 500,000 arrived in @entity115 , its former capital			0
in august this year , @entity17 's @entity117 announced plans to improve and expand @entity119 and @entity120 , as well to develop the new @entity121 50 miles ( 80 km ) north of @entity115			0
" the equipment and facilities in @entity17 are quite old and with the rise of tourism they really need to get up to speed and get foreign experts to come in and help develop that market as quickly as they can , " @entity70 said			1
" we are not seeing that happen as swiftly as we 'd like to			0
" he said @entity91 was the real emerging market in the @entity13 aviation industry , but it also needed to catch up with respect to infrastructure requirements			1
" the growth of discount carriers in @entity91 is phenomenal -- they are actually driving the market in the whole region but investment in infrastructure and airports and technology is not keeping pace with the growth of aviation economics in that country			1
" the story is the same all over @entity92 excluding @entity149 , of course			0
in places like @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity17 , they need to do more than simply open the doors to tourism			1
" safety is fundamental if you want a functioning aviation industry			0

concerns grow over safety amid @entity13 **budget** carrier boom
*newcomers* to the market such as @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity17 have creaking infrastructure
@entity17 is attempting to catch up with an *exponential* growth in its tourism numbers
analysts say @entity91 is leading the region in the **budget** carrier boom
