@entity0 -- the @entity2 announced tuesday that capital charges have been refiled against @entity4 and four other alleged co-conspirators in the september 11 , 2001 , conspiracy to allow prosecution before a military commission at the @entity9 , @entity10 , naval base			1
the move comes after the @entity13 administration dropped plans to prosecute the suspects in federal court in @entity17			1
besides @entity4 , the other suspects accused of participating in the 9/11 plot are @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23			0
all five are at @entity9			0
a @entity26 statement said the charges " allege that the five accused were responsible for the planning and execution " of the 9/11 attacks , resulting in the deaths of nearly 3,000 people			1
charges against all five accused include conspiracy , murder in violation of the law of war , attacking civilians , attacking civilian objects , intentionally causing serious bodily injury , destruction of property in violation of the law of war , hijacking aircraft and terrorism , the statement said			2
the filing of capital charges means the defendants could face death sentences if convicted			2
the final decision about whether the death penalty can be pursued is in the hands of retired vice adm. @entity57			0
in military terminology he is the convening authority of the military commissions , the equivalent of a civilian criminal court			0
the last military execution was in 1961 , involving a @entity65 private who had been convicted of rape and attempted murder of an @entity70 girl			0
@entity4 was first charged in may 2008 before a military commission in @entity9 , but the charges were suspended in early 2009 when the @entity13 administration took over and sought a fresh review of all detainees at the overseas prison			1
later that year , attorney general @entity77 announced @entity4 and several other key terror suspects would face prosecution in the military justice system			2
the @entity13 administration had considered transferring some terror suspects to the @entity82 for prosecution in either special military or civilian courts			1
but after widespread opposition across the political platform , the president announced earlier this year all prosecutions would be in military courts in @entity9			2
@entity13 also had pledged to close the @entity9 detention facility within a year of becoming president			0
however , it remains open due to legal complexities involving the status of some detainees and congressional opposition to holding trials for high - profile suspects in @entity82 criminal courts			1
@entity1 's @entity100 contributed to this story .			0
