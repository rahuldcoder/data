@entity1 professor @entity0 recently claimed that special prosecutor @entity2 , who charged @entity3 in the shooting death of 17 - year - old @entity5 , threatened to sue @entity0 for libel and slander and to have him disbarred			1
according to @entity0 , @entity8 went into a tirade against him after he strongly criticized her			1
he said @entity8 was being unethical for not disclosing material facts to the court in the probable cause affidavit she had filed against @entity3 and had erred by bringing a second - degree murder charge against him , when the evidence did n't support such a charge			2
in an article , @entity0 maintained that @entity8 called @entity1 's law school dean and was transferred to a communications office staff member			1
according to this account , she went into a " 40 - minute rant " about how she could sue @entity1 for his comments			0
she apparently was reminded that @entity0 had a right to his opinion and that his comments were a matter of academic freedom			1
i hope that she was also sent a copy of the @entity34			0
@entity0 claims that @entity8 was required to include in her probable cause affidavit any information that would tend to exculpate @entity3 of the charges against him			1
he 's incorrect , unfortunately			2
@entity40 law does n't require a prosecutor to go as far as @entity0 argues , although i believe such information should be included so that a judge can make a fully informed decision			1
if the facts disclose that the court was intentionally misled by the way information was presented to it , that is a cause for grave concern and reconsideration			0
however , offering a bare - bones affidavit is relatively common and so long as the language is truthful , done in good faith and does n't intentionally mislead the court , then the prosecutor is not obligated to provide evidence that might be exculpatory to a defendant in an affidavit			1
that said , the affidavit @entity8 filed in the @entity3 case is about as minimal as i 've seen in more than 30 years of practice as a criminal defense attorney			2
@entity8 , @entity0 and i all might have varying interpretations of the law , but because @entity8 disagrees with @entity0 , it surely does n't subject him to being sued by her			1
if @entity8 made that threat , it 's frightening for a prosecutor in power to act that way and smacks of prosecutorial overreaching in an effort to chill any critics			1
@entity8 has not publicly responded to @entity0 's claim			1
@entity8 has made the most serious of claims against @entity3 , charging that he committed a homicide by the intentional killing of a unarmed teenager			0
@entity3 may have done exactly that			0
conversely , he may not have			0
the facts will continue to unfold , and more clarity will emerge			0
regardless of the outcome , @entity8 is protected by prosecutorial immunity for her actions , right or wrong			0
i 'm suspicious when those in power can seemingly act without personal consequence for their actions but behave as if they are also immune from public criticism when they are challenged			0
@entity8 is a public official and public person			0
when she introduced herself to the @entity101 public on the @entity3 case , she glided on stage , smiled for the cameras , flashed a v for " victims , " told the country how she prayed with @entity109 's family before she commenced her " impartial " investigation and made it clear that she would circumvent the grand jury , which was already scheduled , and make the charging decision herself			1
an elected official , especially one who has beckoned the cameras and reporters to record and transmit her every word and act , should be subject to the closest scrutiny			2
once she opened that door , the public has every right to walk in , including @entity0			1
@entity3 's history is relevant since it relates to his intent and motive when he shot and killed @entity5			1
would n't it be fair then that @entity8 's history should be similarly relevant when assessments and opinions are made regarding her prosecution of @entity3 ? whether the prosecution is a call for justice or a political prosecution is a fair question			1
@entity137 , a columnist for @entity8 's hometown newspaper , the @entity138 , identified a number of people who @entity8 lambasted when they questioned her tactics or motives			2
they include @entity145 , former president of @entity146 and the @entity147 ; @entity148 from the @entity149 ; @entity150 , a professor and division chief of pediatrics at @entity154 ; and the writer , @entity137 himself			0
does her behavior suggest a person who listens to no one other than those who agree with her ? does her criticism of her critics bespeak one who has an agenda that may be greater than the public may see and hear at a news conference ? @entity8 was appointed by gov. @entity167 to prosecute the case after @entity169 , the experienced state attorney for the 18th @entity170 who had been in office 18 years , mysteriously announced that he was stepping down from the case , " to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest ... " even though @entity169 had one of his most experienced career prosecutors , @entity176 , involved in the case within hours of the shooting and had scheduled a grand jury to consider the case , he unexpectedly left			1
to this day , there 's no documentation or public statement about what possible conflict of interest existed			2
from the many i have talked to and from all that i have learned , it is my informed belief that there was no conflict of interest at all			0
contrary to some speculation , @entity169 was n't personally involved in the investigation and had never met @entity3 or @entity3 's father			1
why was that prosecutors ' office , which even @entity8 praised , replaced ? a grand jury could have appropriately considered the case			1
that 's what grand juries do			1
was there a fear that the grand jury might consider the evidence and not indict ? @entity208 looks like it			1
if that 's true , then the question is whether a fair and impartial review of the evidence actually occurred			2
or were the charges that @entity8 brought a foregone conclusion from the onset ? @entity8 and @entity167 espouse similar political philosophies			0
they are @entity218 - supporting , far - right self - described conservatives			0
it is telling that @entity8 , who has recently been praised by many in the @entity222 - @entity101 community for charging @entity3 , has been subjected to some of the harshest criticism by many in minority communities for other cases			0
@entity8 has prosecuted a string of controversial cases			0
she led the prosecution against a 12 - year - old boy , @entity232 , to try him for first - degree murder in the death of his 2 - year - old brother			0
@entity236 was born to a 12 - year - old mother and if he is convicted , will be the youngest person ever sentenced to life in prison without parole in @entity101			0
many in the @entity222 - @entity101 community in @entity243 are outraged over @entity8 's prosecution of an abused black woman who claimed she shot a gun into the air to ward off her abuser			2
she received a 20 - year prison sentence			0
were the charges brought against @entity3 in @entity5 's death decided purely on the basis of the evidence and facts , or were political considerations in play , such as @entity167 's and @entity8 's efforts to appeal to the @entity222 - @entity101 community ? i hope @entity0 and others keep their scrutiny , questions and concerns forthcoming and do n't relent			1
our democracy and the @entity266 require it			0
if @entity8 did everything properly on the case , the truth and its outcome will be the ultimate response to her critics			2
alternatively , if politics proves to have been the driving force , we will again have proof of the wonders that the @entity34 brings when it is exercised without regard of retaliation from those wielding power			2
follow @ @entity283 on twitter			0

@entity0 said special prosecutor threatened him with a lawsuit
@entity289 : @entity2 's handling of @entity5 case should be open to scrutiny
he says outside critics are right to examine whether politics played a role
@entity299 : why was n't the case handled in normal fashion by a prosecutor and grand jury ?
