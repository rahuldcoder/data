-- the pilot at the helm of @entity5 was training to fly a @entity7 and was sitting next to a man in his first trip as an instructor pilot when their plane 's main landing gear hit a seawall around @entity16 's airport , a @entity2 official said tuesday			1
@entity17 , the head of the @entity18 , revealed these and other details during a news conference that included information about the pilots and their flying experience , based on the interviews they 've conducted with investigators			1
having finished classroom and simulator training , the " flying pilot " -- as @entity17 referred to him -- was in the piloting portion of his training to fly a @entity7 at the time of saturday 's crash			1
he had flown 10 legs and had about 35 hours of flying time with the 777 , which put him about halfway through the training required by @entity39 of 20 legs and 60 flight hours , when the plane went down , @entity17 said			1
did pilot have enough 777 experience ? sitting beside him during saturday 's flight from @entity47 to @entity16 was the instructor pilot			1
the trip across the @entity50 was the first time he had been an instructor pilot and the first time he 'd traveled with the flying pilot , according to @entity17			1
that seemingly uneventful , more than 10 - hour flight ended in a few chaotic , panicked minutes of fury , after which two people were dead and 182 others were transported to local hospitals			2
" sections of the cabin ... are found very early in the debris field , " said @entity17 , who had walked a few hundred feet from the seawall where the plane 's landing gear and then tail first slammed into the seawall to where it mercifully came to a rest			1
" you can see aircraft parts , gallery materials , newspapers , magazines and flooring			0
" according to the pilots ' accounts , the tensions started before the plane touched ground			2
the three pilots in the cockpit -- another was in the cabin -- told investigators they set the " auto throttle " speed to 137 knots ( 157 mph ) , which is the speed it should have been going			0
akin to cruise control , auto throttles are used to maintain a plane 's speed			1
at 200 feet above ground , the instructor pilot said he noted precision approach path indicator lights indicated the giant jet was too low			1
it was then " he recognized that the auto throttles were not maintaining speed , and he established a go - around attitude , " said the @entity18 chief			1
" he went to push the throttles forward , but he stated that the other pilot had already ( done so )			2
" @entity17 cautioned anyone from jumping to conclusions as to whether a mechanical or pilot error is to blame for the crash			1
she also spoke specifically about the auto throttles , saying investigators were delving into how they were working and how they were used			0
but @entity17 also stated : " the crew is required to maintain a safe aircraft ... one of the very critical things that needs to be monitored on an approach to landing is speed			1
so we need to understand what was going on in the cockpit , and also what was going on in the aircraft			0
" 2 dead , 182 injured -- including 2 ejected flight attendants when it departed @entity125 , @entity5 had 307 passengers and crew aboard			1
despite the scale of the wreckage -- a hole burned through much of the cabin 's roof and the aircraft 's back half lopped off -- 123 walked away			2
others were n't so lucky , most of all the two @entity137 teenagers who died in the crash			0
girls killed in crash were headed for camp those working on the flight were among the injured			2
the third pilot in the cockpit cracked a rib			0
one flight attendant was temporarily trapped by an evacuation chute that opened inside the plane			1
two other flight attendants were not in their seats at the rear of the aircraft when the plane finally ground to a halt , because they were ejected as the aircraft broke up			1
" they were found down the runway and off to the side of the runway , " @entity17 said			2
flight attendants hailed as heroes many of those hospitalized have been released			0
at @entity166 , for instance , 50 of the 62 patients are now free to go home			0
but others still require care			0
four adults and one child in critical condition are still at @entity166 suffering from internal bleeding , fractures and spinal cord , abdominal and traumatic brain injuries , according to the hospital			0
crew recall plane being too high , then too low the " flying pilot " and " instructor pilot " who were in the front seat of the cockpit were not among the injured , according to @entity17			1
@entity39 hired the flying pilot in 1994 , after which he reported amassing nearly 10,000 hours of total flight time			1
that experience included time piloting 737 , 747 and a- 320 aircraft , and he was a ground school and simulator instructor for the latter model			2
the instructor pilot , a @entity125 air force veteran with about 13,000 hours of flight experience , recalled @entity5 being " slightly high when they passed 4,000 feet ( and ) they set vertical speed mode at about 1,500 feet per minute , " explained @entity17			1
but they ended up coming in low			0
the third pilot in the cockpit told investigators that , with " the nose ... pitched up , ... he could not see the runway , " said the @entity18 chief			1
in the last few hundred feet before touchdown , the crew was making both lateral and vertical adjustments -- meaning they were both trying to move sideways to get toward the runway and adjust their height			0
shock and survival : plane crash through the eyes of children when the aircraft hit , it spun 360 degrees			2
an oil tank ruptured and leaked fuel onto the plane 's right engine , starting a fire			1
eventually , evacuation chutes deployed , and at least seven of the aircraft 's eight doors were opened			0
( an eighth was found on the ground , @entity17 explained			2
) very soon after the plane stopped , tending to the wounded and the investigation began			0
that probe will continue for months , though authorities have released significant details so far			0
so much information , in fact , the @entity236 , for a second straight day on tuesday , criticized what it called the " @entity18 's release of incomplete , out - of - context information " that " has fueled rampant speculation about the cause of the accident			1
" first responders describe eerie , chaotic moments after crash the union further questioned whether some tools were available to the crew , claiming , for instance , that the " @entity252 , a critical aid to pilots , ( was ) out of service			0
" " without the full body of facts surrounding a catastrophic event , partial or incomplete information can lead to erroneous conclusions and , in turn , skew the perception of individuals ' behavior , " the pilots union said in its tuesday statement			0
" this could then lead to misguided assessments of the crew 's intentions and actions			0
" @entity17 disputed the union 's claims earlier tuesday on @entity0 , saying the agency believes that transparent release of information is crucial			2
" we believe that it is always better to put out the correct information and factual information so that bad information is not able to propagate , " she said			0
aviation experts say that air crashes often involve several factors , and the @entity16 tragedy appears to be following form			0
experience , training , crew actions , airport navigation , and now the possible role of a mechanical system are all in the mix. @entity18 is not expected to render a decision on probable cause for months			1
during her news conference later tuesday , @entity17 stressed that " there 's still a lot of work to be done			2
" " we will not determine probable cause while we are here on scene , " she said , adding there 's a lot of information to collect and analyze			0
" ... i would really encourage all of you to be very cautious about speculating on the cause of the crash			0
" how does an air crash investigation work ? @entity0 's @entity310 , @entity311 and @entity312 contributed to this report .			0

@entity316 : 1 flight attendant was trapped by chute , 2 were ejected , @entity18 chief says

sitting next to him was a man who was an " instructor pilot " for first time , she adds
