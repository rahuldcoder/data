@entity0 is happy to be alive			1
in 2008 , the young husband and father was riding his four - wheeler on his grandfather 's farm when he came in contact with a downed power line			1
his body was jolted with 7,200 volts of electricity			0
" i remember waking up from an induced coma a few days later and being told that they had to amputate my both hands in order to save my life , " said @entity0 , now 34			1
" my mom and dad kept telling me that i would get through this			0
since his accident , @entity0 has had a variety of prosthetic hands to help him function with his " new normal " in everyday life			1
" it 's like i 'm carrying a tool box , but only have one tool , " said @entity0			1
" you ca n't use a wrench for everything			0
" in recent years , the prosthetic devices field has seen remarkable developments			0
and @entity0 is the first double amputee in the world to receive one of the most innovative products on the market : bionic hands that are , in part , controlled by an @entity38 app. the @entity39 is the latest innovation from @entity42 - based prosthetic developers @entity43			1
@entity44 approves first bionic eye the hand offers " unparalleled dexterity and control , enabling wearers to more easily perform activities of daily living and thus increase their quality of life , " said @entity54 , ceo of @entity43			2
the company claims it offers the closest thing on the market to a real human hand			0
unlike most conventional prosthetics , this hand boasts five individually - powered fingers -- including a fully rotatable thumb			1
" this is something we 've never seen available for patients before , " said @entity62 , senior clinical director at @entity63 , who is not affiliated with @entity43			0
the prosthesis also has an auto - grasp feature , which prevents accidental slippage when , say , holding a soda can or picking up an apple			2
but the most unique part of the prosthetic is the app control			0
on an @entity77 or an @entity38 , users can select 24 different types of grip patterns that will allow more functionality			0
" if you are holding a computer mouse ( and ) you want to right click , that is a complicated thing with a prosthetic			0
but this integrated app technology allows a person to do this with ease , " said @entity62			0
these are basic movements many of us take for granted : a tri-pod grip to pick up a pen , or hand - shake grip for business meetings , said @entity62 , who has fitted hundreds of amputees with prosthetic devices			2
amputee scales 103 floors with mind - controlled ' bionic leg ' " for the first time in five years i can hold my daughter 's hand , " said @entity0			1
" i ca n't tell you what a gift that feels like			0
" users can also customize grip patterns through the integrated app technology			2
" let 's say you want to go out and play pool with your friends			2
you can customize a grasp pattern that allows you to hold the pool stick -- or if you like to do handy work , you may customize one to hold an electric drill , " said @entity62			1
the hands are not waterproof , which is one reason @entity0 says he 'll still keep his other prosthetics , like his metal claw , available			1
" nothing is perfect , but i feel like i can be a more active participant in everyday life with these hands , " said @entity0 , who now spends his time reaching out to new amputees about keeping a positive outlook on their situation			1
" i can do pretty much everything i could before ; it just might take me a little longer			0

@entity0 's hands were amputated after a four - wheeler accident
bionic hand users can customize different grips -- holding a pool stick , for example
" for the first time in five years , i can hold my daughter 's hand , " @entity0 says
