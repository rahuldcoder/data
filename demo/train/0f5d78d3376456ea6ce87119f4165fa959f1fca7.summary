-- @entity1 is set to go ahead with some of its whaling activities even though a recent international court ruling ordered the country to end its whale hunt in the @entity7			1
the @entity9 nation halted its annual @entity7 whaling mission after the @entity12 's @entity11 ( @entity11 ) ruled last month the hunt violated an international moratorium on commercial whaling			1
the @entity17 fisheries ministry announced last week it would still proceed with a smaller research program in the @entity19			2
the mission 's departure , originally scheduled for april 22 , was postponed until after a state visit by @entity24 president @entity23 , according to local media reports			0
the whaling fleet is now expected to leave @entity1 's shore on saturday			2
@entity1 is also making preparations for a new proposal which could see its whaling fleet return to the @entity7 as early as next year , the ministry said			1
both announcements by the ministry sparked renewed anger among environmentalists , who say @entity1 's research program is a thinly veiled attempt to circumvent a ban on the commercial whale meat trade			2
the head of @entity1 , @entity41 , said the fisheries ministry 's latest announcement was a " huge disappointment " that flew in the face of the @entity12 court 's ruling and threatened to " damage @entity1 's international standing			1
" @entity50 's founder captain @entity49 was skeptical the revised plan reflected a sincere attempt by @entity1 to ensure the whale hunt produced valuable research			2
" if they do it as a genuine scientific program they wo n't be able to kill very many whales and it would n't be worthwhile for them to go down there ( to the @entity7 ) , " he said			0
although few people in @entity1 regularly eat whale meat , many support the controversial whaling research program			0
a survey , released by the @entity17 newspaper @entity68 earlier this week , found that 60 % of respondents thought the research whaling should continue , while around 23 % said the practice should stop			0
almost half of those who thought the research should continue said they did n't eat whale meat			0
only 4 % said they consumed whale meat " occasionally " while 10 % said they ate it on " rare occasions , " according to @entity68			0
@entity1 's @entity82 said the catch from the upcoming @entity19 mission would be reduced from 380 whales to 210 and nonlethal methods for carrying out the research would be explored , according to a statement released by the ministry last week			1
in a separate statement , fisheries minister @entity89 said @entity1 would conduct research whaling " based on international law and scientific evidence , " while firmly maintaining its policy of " aiming for the resumption of commercial whaling			1
" @entity97 is making preparations to submit a revised whaling plan for both the @entity19 and the @entity7 to the @entity100 by this fall , ahead of the 2015 - 16 season			1
he also said @entity1 would explore ways to deal with anti-whaling activists , who are often involved in scuffles with @entity17 whaling vessels			0
the @entity100 banned commercial whaling in 1986 , but @entity1 has continued to carry out whale hunts by taking advantage of a loophole that permits the killing of mammals for scientific research , despite strong criticism from international anti-whaling campaigners and governments of countries that include the @entity24 and @entity117			1
the @entity11 ruled on march 31 that @entity1 can no longer continue its whale hunt in the @entity7 after the court failed to find evidence the program had legitimate research value			2
in the @entity68 poll , 40 % of @entity17 respondents said the court 's decision was reasonable while almost as many , 39 % said it was unreasonable			0
@entity127 : waiting for the whales			0

@entity1 will proceed with a whaling mission in the @entity19
a @entity12 court found the nation 's @entity7 hunt violated a ban on commercial whaling
@entity1 says the whaling is scientific ; plans to submit a revised proposal soon
