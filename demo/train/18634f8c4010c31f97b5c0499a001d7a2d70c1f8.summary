under a clear night sky on a rocky arid outcrop , @entity1 astronomers are waiting for the stars to come out and play			1
sightings of faraway galaxies , black holes and the @entity8 are just part of the job for the starwatchers at the @entity12 ( @entity12 )			0
" the site is in an ideal location because there is very little light pollution so the skies are extremely dark , " said @entity13 , an astronomer at @entity12			0
" we do n't get extreme seasons here , so it 's good conditions for our research all year round			0
" based in @entity24 -- a four - hour drive from @entity26 -- the observatory is home to one of the largest single optical telescopes in the world and is symbolic of @entity1 's growing commitment to astronomy			1
the appropriately named @entity34 is the jewel of the observatory , capable of detecting a candle flame as far away as the moon and light a billion times too faint to be seen by the naked eye , according to @entity12 's astronomers			1

" the telescope is funded by a consortium including @entity1 , the @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , the @entity57 and @entity58			1
in 1996 , the @entity1 government , under the leadership of the @entity60 , identified astronomy as a key area for investment			1
in a white paper , lawmakers recognized that if @entity1 failed to invest in " flagship sciences " then the country would be viewed as a " second - class " nation " chained forever " to the need for food and clothing			1
@entity74 , director of the @entity75 , said that through investment in science and technology , the government can help tackle some of @entity1 's social problems			1

@entity74 added : " the target that we have is to spend 1 % of gdp on science and technology			0
we have n't reached that yet			0
" but he added that the benefits of financing astrophysics are already paying off by boosting higher education , employing more professors and contributing to the " knowledge economy			0
" " this is a an exciting time for astronomy in @entity1 , " he said , " inspiring young people toward education , having the skills to develop economies on the continent and build infrastructure			1
" @entity74 added : " when we train an engineer to do a job , they gain the right skills , meaning they can go out and contribute to the country 's economy in a number of different ways			0
" in 2018 , construction will begin on the ambitious @entity115 ( @entity115 ) , an extremely powerful radio telescope based in the deserts of @entity1 and @entity118 , in a partnership with more than 20 countries			1
@entity115 @entity1 project director @entity121 said : " it has already attracted a lot of young people into science and mathematics in @entity1 and from other @entity1 countries and it 's attracted a lot of top - rate scientists			2

observatories of all shapes and sizes are scattered across @entity1 in locations such as @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 to name a few			2
other countries are focusing on training the next generation of astronomers , with the @entity152 in @entity153 , for example , offering an undergraduate course in astrophysics , designed to train young people to work in observatories			0
telescopes and observatories will continue to spring up in @entity1 as international cooperation and investment flows into the continent , according to @entity162 , assistant secretary - general at the @entity163 ( @entity163 )			2
he said such a trend " will eventually feed into the economic development of the region			0
" established in 2010 to promote awareness of astronomy , @entity163 members include @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity153 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176			1
and development in the region is already taking off			0
in october , @entity172 opened @entity180 's largest observatory , in the @entity181 on the outskirts of the capital @entity184			1
the facility -- run by the @entity186 ( @entity186 ) -- is the first step towards a space program , according to group director @entity189			0
he said the project , which includes two large telescopes and cost $ 3.4 million , will inspire children " towards science and technology especially in physics , mathematics , medicine ( and ) engineering			2

but @entity189 believes the observatory will have a profound impact on the country 's progress			0
" the effect of the program in @entity172 is scientific development ( and ) the transformation of an agricultural - based economy to an industrial - based and knowledge - based economy , " said @entity189			2
the @entity186 hopes the telescopes will also boost tourism , as space fanatics visit the @entity225 nation to admire the country 's first observatory			0
@entity189 added that he wants @entity172 to become a " world - class research " center for satellite technology and earth observation by 2025			0
" ( the program intends ) to see a transformed society in @entity172 and @entity1 as a whole , " he said .			1
