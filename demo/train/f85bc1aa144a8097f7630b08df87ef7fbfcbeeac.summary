-- even the @entity1 was one of @entity3 's biggest fans			1
so said the cheeky chameleon of an actor when he received an honorary @entity6 in 2010 and remarked that the pontiff -- he did n't say which one -- wrote him a fan letter extolling his performance as the bandito @entity11 in " @entity12 " ( 1960 )			1
this struck @entity3 as odd			2
" i 've played more bandits , thieves , killers , warlords , molesters and @entity19 than you can shake a stick at , " he said			0
no doubt he got a pass from the @entity1 because as the bad guy , the famed character actor , who died tuesday at 98 , had a smile as lethal as his aim			1
the most beloved of his screen roles were as @entity11 in " @entity12 " and @entity28 , the opportunistic robber , who was sometimes an ally but more often the adversary of @entity31 in the 1966 @entity33 spaghetti western " @entity28			1
" but surely @entity3 , a prolific actor who made more than 50 films and almost as many television appearances , possessed the universal blood type			1
his screen niche was the @entity39 ethnic			1
in addition to @entity42 , his characters included @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46			0
he appeared in films large and small , from " @entity48 " ( 1961 ) , where he played a mechanic besotted by @entity50 , to " @entity51 , " his 1956 screen debut as @entity53 , the wily cotton planter who aims to deflower his rival 's virgin bride , @entity58			0
sometimes he was the lead , more often the supporting player			0
but when @entity3 was on screen , you forgot that @entity31 , @entity63 or @entity64 was next to him			1
occasionally the sinewy @entity3 -- born to a @entity66 family in 1915 in what then was the predominantly @entity69 - @entity39 neighborhood of @entity70 , @entity71 -- played a jew			1
like the rabbi who helps convert @entity74 so she can marry @entity64 in " @entity75 " ( 2000 )			2
and the aging screenwriter who befriends @entity77 in " @entity78 " ( 2006 )			0
though he made more than 50 films , @entity3 treated movies as a way to finance his work in theater : " i do n't live to act , i act to live , " he said			1
indeed , he was set to make his film debut as @entity86 , the character @entity84 ultimately played in " @entity87 , " in 1953 ( @entity84 won an @entity6 )			2
instead , he chose to appear on stage in " @entity89			0
" he was a founding member of @entity90 and appeared in 30 @entity91 plays			0
among his triumphs were @entity93 ' " the @entity94 " ( 1951 ) and " @entity89 " ( 1953 ) ; the latter earned him a @entity96			0
among his personal triumphs : @entity3 and his wife , actress @entity98 , with whom he often appeared on stage from the 1960s through 1990s , were married 66 years			2
( the secret of their marital longevity , claimed @entity104 , was that her husband did the ironing			0
) a captivating storyteller who first gained attention as a student at the @entity90 for his monologues about his time as an @entity115 medic in @entity116 clearing soldiers out of brothels , @entity3 was beloved by directors and co-stars as much for his humor as his professionalism			1
in his 2005 memoir , " @entity124 , the @entity125 and me			0
" he claimed that the role of mr. @entity127 , the subzero doctor who turns adversaries into ice in the 1960s tv show " @entity131 , " was responsible for the largest percentage of his fan mail			2
nothing else came close , not even his role of dapper @entity136 in " @entity137 , @entity138 " he continued working well into his 90s , in roles such as the liquor - store proprietor in " @entity142 " ( 2003 ) and a financial bigwig in " @entity144 : @entity145 " ( 2010 ) , his last movie			0
and @entity3 left ' em laughing : when he received his honorary @entity6 in 2010 , he told the joke about the nonagenarian whose friends send a hooker to house for his birthday			1
when she arrives , and promises the man " super sex , " he says , " i guess i 'll take the soup			0

@entity159 : the late charactor actor @entity3 told a story that the @entity1 sent him a fan letter
she says @entity3 was great at playing bad guys and was often cast as an " @entity39 ethnic "
he acted with big names in film -- @entity31 , @entity63 , @entity64 -- but his love was theater
@entity173 : he worked well into his 90s ; beloved for monologues , wit and professionalism
