no laptops , phones or @entity4			0
bathrooms closed off by marshals			0
the corruption trial of former @entity9 mayor @entity8 cranks up monday with a federal judge imposing tough rules on spectators and reporters during jury selection			1
in an order issued last week , @entity16 district judge @entity15 imposed those restrictions because of concerns that courtroom rules " may not be respected " by some unnamed miscreants			0
@entity8 's pleas for federal help for his flooded city caught the nation 's attention in the aftermath of @entity28 in 2005			1
now out of office , he 's pleaded not guilty to federal charges of bribery , money laundering , fraud and filing false tax returns			1
prosecutors accused him of being at the center of " a bribery and kickback scheme " in which he allegedly received checks , cash , wire transfers , personal services and free travel from businessmen seeking contracts and favorable treatment from the city			1
after preliminary questioning , some jurors will be quizzed behind closed doors , @entity15 ordered			0
electronic devices have been barred from the courtroom , and the nearby restrooms on the fifth floor of the courthouse " will be closed to all members of the media and public during voir dire proceedings , " she wrote			0
those restrictions may be lifted " after the jury is sworn and in the event the court regains confidence that there will be full compliance with its orders by the media and public , " she added			2
prosecutors accuse @entity8 of taking more than $ 200,000 in bribes , while his family members allegedly received a vacation in @entity74 ; first - class airfare to @entity77 ; private jet travel and a limousine for @entity80 ; and cellular phone service			1
in exchange , businesses that coughed up cash for @entity8 and his family won more than $ 5 million in city contracts , according to an indictment brought in january 2013			1
two businessmen named in the charges have pleaded guilty to making payoffs and are cooperating with prosecutors			1
a third was found guilty of bribing two @entity8 staffers , while another admitted to paying kickbacks to the sheriff of nearby @entity95 after winning a project management contract there			1
but @entity98 , a @entity99 defense lawyer and legal observer , told @entity0 , " corruption is still very hard to prove			1
" in most businesses , @entity98 said , " you 're going to give the work to who you know , who you trust , who you perhaps took a family vacation with			0
the issue is going to be the testimony of those people , as to whether or not they expected to get something back in return for taking the family on vacation			0
" and if prosecutors can show that @entity8 promised city business in exchange for their favors , " then he 's done , " she said			1
@entity8 sought to have the charges dismissed in october after another federal judge blasted what he called the " grotesque " misconduct of prosecutors in the @entity128 shootings of unarmed civilians by police at the @entity131			1
the judge tossed out the convictions of five cashiered cops after ruling that members of the @entity16 attorney 's office tainted their 2011 trial by anonymously posting " egregious and inflammatory " comments at online news sites			0
@entity8 argued that he was the target of the same underground effort , citing " a continuum of perjorative statements and demeaning racial epithets " aimed at him			0
the @entity16 attorney 's office said none of the prosecutors involved in the @entity131 case played a role in the @entity8 investigation , and @entity15 denied @entity8 's motion			2
the onetime cable - television executive was elected mayor in 2002 and was in office when the massive @entity28 slammed ashore just east of @entity9 on august 29 , 2005			2
the storm flooded more than three - fourths of the low - lying city and left more than 1,800 dead , most of them in across @entity161			0
supporters credited @entity8 's sometimes - profane demands for aid from @entity165 with helping reveal the botched federal response to the storm -- a fiasco that embarrassed the @entity170 administration and led to billions of federal dollars being poured into @entity173 reconstruction efforts			2
but he also had his critics : a congressional committee criticized him for delaying evacuation orders , and his frantic description of post-storm @entity9 as a violent wasteland with up to 10,000 dead turned out to be greatly exaggerated			0
as he sought re-election in 2006 , with much of the city 's @entity182 population displaced by storm damage , he was blasted for insisting that @entity9 would remain a " chocolate " city			2
he won a second term despite the controversies , but left office in mid- 2010 with approval ratings in the cellar			0
afterward , he told @entity0 his career in public office was over : " i have given my pound of flesh , " he said .			2
