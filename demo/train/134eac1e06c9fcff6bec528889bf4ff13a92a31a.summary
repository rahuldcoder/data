-- @entity1 , who some have called an " architect " of @entity4 , spent his tuesday being grilled by members of @entity6 for having described too candidly the deception involved in passing the bill			1
it was a useful hearing but only the beginning of holding accountable the " experts " who gave us this catastrophic law			0
the new @entity6 now has a much more important chance to demonstrate that deceiving the @entity17 people is unacceptable			2
@entity19 majorities in the @entity21 and @entity22 can and should use their authority to replace @entity24 as director of the @entity26			1
the @entity26 is charged with providing nonpartisan economic analysis to @entity6			1
this position gives the agency an outsized influence on policy , as reporters , commentators , " fact checkers , " and many members of @entity6 ( most of whom should know better ) treat @entity26 estimates -- or " scores " -- like trump cards in debates over legislation			1
in the @entity4 debate especially , the @entity26 projections proved vital and probably decisive			1
as @entity1 explained in his now - infamous remarks , the very survival of the health care bill depended on how @entity26 scored its various provisions			2
" the bill was written in a tortured way to make sure the @entity26 did not score the mandate as taxes , " @entity1 described			1
" if @entity26 scored the mandate as taxes , the bill dies			1
" what @entity1 did n't say is that @entity56 's @entity26 , in essence , relied on @entity1 's own model to do its scoring			1
the first page of @entity26 's technical description of its health insurance model thanks @entity1 , and the document cites him many times			1
and @entity1 actually sat on the @entity26 's panel of health advisers during at least some of the health care debate			1
( he says he does n't remember if it overlapped with his time as a paid adviser to the @entity70 administration			0
) so when @entity1 describes the deception involved in passing @entity4 , it included at the very least the @entity26 's acceptance of @entity1 's " tortured " manipulations , and at worst the opening of @entity26 models to be adjusted by a paid agent of the @entity21 's political goals			1
the agency needs a new director for the new @entity6 , one dedicated to the profound change required to produce honest and accurate scores			1
this is the first and perhaps most important step @entity6 can take to show it is dedicated to real change			2
the @entity26 is more responsible for giving us @entity4 than @entity1 is , and as culpable as @entity86 in @entity6 or president @entity70			1
@entity26 was critical to passing the bill , as @entity1 attests , because it provided supporters the numbers they needed to justify their claims			1
obamacare advocates said the law would lower the deficit by $ 109 billion over 10 years			0
they said it would n't cost @entity17 jobs			0
they said it would help the economy			0
the @entity26 score backed up those claims			2
and coming from the supposedly definitive source of economic analysis , that counted for a lot			0
but as we know now ( and many of us knew then ) , it was all untrue			0
for one thing , before @entity4 was passed , the @entity26 did n't even consider the effects the law would have on the labor market			1
in other words , the agency scored a bill that dramatically changed costs for businesses and individuals , and it assumed no effect on employment or government revenue			0
in february , four years after @entity4 became law , the @entity26 updated its projections about the law 's effect on the economy , and included the bombshell that it would result in the equivalent of 2.5 million fewer @entity17 with full - time jobs in 2024			1
other economists predict an even larger impact on the economy			0
@entity130 of the @entity131 estimated the law will reduce the size of the labor market by 3 % -- the equivalent of approximately 4 million full - time jobs -- or almost double the impact estimated by the @entity26			0
( the @entity21 is actually trying to sell us on the idea that it 's a good thing millions of people will leave the workforce or work less because of subsidies under @entity4 , which gives you some idea of how much it values work			2
) the @entity26 , for its part , now admits to @entity6 that @entity4 reduces government revenues			1
and an analysis by @entity19 staff for the @entity151 has concluded , based on @entity26 's projections , that the declines in employment and tax revenue mean @entity4 will increase the deficit by $ 131 billion over a 10 - year period			1
so @entity26 's estimate was only off by a couple hundred billion			2
if the @entity26 had reported in early 2010 that @entity4 would result in the equivalent of 2.5 million fewer people working and would increase the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars , how many @entity86 senators would have voted for the law ? ( remember , the move to end debate and enact @entity4 in the @entity22 passed by one vote			1
) if not for @entity26 's misleading score , the bill would almost certainly not have become law			2
a responsible , honest agency would have said the bill was too complicated to score -- that there was simply no way for it to accurately predict how millions of businesses and individuals in an economy this complex would respond to a law as sweeping and convoluted as @entity4			2
the challenge of economic prediction is daunting even for much simpler legislation			0
but instead , the @entity26 did n't even try to predict how the law would alter economic decisions ( using " dynamic " scoring , as it should be required to do )			2
using its static models , the agency assumed key provisions would change no one 's behavior			0
so the score was bogus from the start			0
yet despite being proved flagrantly wrong in its predictions , the current staff at the @entity26 would do it the same way again today ! the @entity19 majority should not even consider reappointing the same leadership at @entity26			0
the @entity6 would essentially be asking to be grubered again			0
in the long run , @entity6 should find a more accountable , more transparent system of economic analysis , such as getting the views of multiple ratings agencies in competition with each other , the success of which depends on accuracy over time			0
but in the meantime , we urgently need new leadership at the @entity26 to push for more accurate , dynamic scores and to be honest and upfront about what economists know and what they do n't			2
this is a change @entity19 can make immediately when the new @entity6 convenes in january and it is entirely within their control			0
it is one of the most consequential choices they will make			0
it certainly would be tragic if , after skewering @entity1 , they turned around and reappointed another expert who gave us @entity4			0
join us on @entity225 / @entity224 .			0

an @entity4 ' architect ' said considering the mandate a tax would have *killed* plan
@entity232 : @entity26 chief @entity24 's agency provided incorrect estimates
he says *republicans* in @entity6 should n't *rehire* @entity24 for the new *session*
