-- there may have been more alluring electric cars on display at this year 's @entity4 , but the beauty of this prototype lies in its performance			1
the @entity8 can travel 333 kilometers ( more than 200 miles ) on a single charge , say its @entity12 creators @entity10 , and it also boasts supercar - like acceleration -- 0 to 60 mph in just 4.8 seconds			1
the key to these remarkable statistics lies not , as you might expect , underneath the hood but in its wheels			2
most electric vehicles house a single motor in the area vacated by the petrol engine , but the @entity8 has four motors , which fit in the hubs its wheels			1
each one delivers 65 kilowatts , giving the car a total output of 260 kilowatts , compared with the 80 kilowatts of output available in , say , the @entity30			0
a 24.5 kwh battery sits below the floor along with inverters and controllers , which fit into a unique steel monocoque helping reduce weight , according to @entity10			0
more innovation : @entity39 's smallest car fuels nanotech advance the @entity8 -- @entity41 stands for leading efficiency in - wheel motor -- took 15 months to complete and builds on advances made with the fantastic - looking @entity45 -- a super-fast eight - wheeler designed by @entity10 ceo and president @entity47			1
his latest design may not look so sporty but the @entity41 does come with low - friction tires and a low - set chassis , which helps reduce drag , says the company			0
recent technological advances are making in - wheel motors more attractive , says @entity56 , from the @entity57 at the @entity59 's @entity58			0
" motors have become more powerful for their weight and the volume they take up , which has made it more practical to get very good performance from putting electric motors directly in the wheels of cars , " @entity60 said			2
and electric motors provide drivers with far greater control than internal combustion engines , he says			0
" if you do put an electric motor in each wheel then there are huge possibilities with things like traction control and stability control , " he added			1
while car makers including @entity84 and @entity85 have used in - wheel motors in concept cars that have never been commercially available , @entity10 hopes its four - seat sedan will go into production in 2013			2
@entity10 says the price will depend on how many it makes , but if the car ends up being mass produced , customers can expect to pay around Â ¥ 2.5 million ( $ 32,000 ) .			0
