-- @entity1 , as the reports go , is working on a " smart watch , " although the secretive company wo n't say anything about it , of course			1
so , after months of speculation , what does its chief rival in the mobile world do ? announce that it definitely is working on a smart watch			1
@entity13 , executive vice president of @entity15 's mobile business , said as much during an interview in @entity17 , where the company is based			1
and he said it 's not a knee - jerk reaction to @entity1 's rumored plans			1
" we 've been preparing the watch product for so long , " @entity13 told @entity22			1
" we are working very hard to get ready for it			0
we are preparing products for the future , and the watch is definitely one of them			0
" he did not give any details on when the watch may be released , what features it will have or how much it will cost			0
with its @entity37 line of smartphones , @entity15 has become the first competitor to provide a real challenge to the dominant @entity41			2
while @entity1 's iconic phone remains the single-most popular mobile device -- the release of the @entity45 led to a record sales quarter and was the most popular of the 75 million devices running @entity1 's @entity49 system that were sold in those three months -- @entity15 moved into a solid second place with its @entity51 the @entity51 outsold the @entity52 during the third quarter of last year before the @entity45 's release , and the company announced last week that the @entity55 is on its way			1
now the companies seem poised to go head - to - head again in what appears to be an emerging market -- wearable tech. @entity64 's fitness - oriented @entity62 has led the charge			1
but few new products have captured the imagination of the tech - minded such as @entity68 , an eyewear - like headset that offers augmented - reality images as well as basic smartphone - like features			2
the device is due later this year and has started popping up on the faces of field testers			0
then there is @entity76 , the smartwatch that raked in about $ 8 million on @entity78 and has begun shipping to backers			0
but will there be a market for these devices outside of early - adopter technophiles and loyalists who will scoop up any new product their favorite company creates ? early signs say the public might need a little more information first			2
according to an unscientific survey of users by mobile deals site @entity94 , 26 % of respondents said they were interested in buying a rumored @entity96 , 38 % said they were not interested and more than a third , 36 % , said they were n't sure			0
( the survey was conducted before @entity15 confirmed it 's in the game as well			2
) the top five features respondents said they 'd like to see in a watch were e-mail and texting , phone calls , @entity105 , @entity106 and weather updates			0
" while consumers are seemingly divided about their desire to own the rumored @entity1 @entity96 , it 's fascinating that the most desired features for the watch mirror popular @entity41 capabilities , " said @entity94 ceo @entity111			1
" it 's as though consumers are only interested in a watch that offers everything the smartphone does , only in a more convenient ' package			0
' what they seem to crave is a way to more easily access @entity41 features everywhere they go			0
