-- it was only after i joined @entity0 on may 8 , 1990 , that i got to know @entity3 and learn tv news and life lessons from him			1
in recent weeks and months , i 've been thinking of those lessons as i worked on our new @entity0 one - hour documentary : " @entity3 : the @entity9			1
" here -- in no particular order -- are five things i learned from the @entity0 founder : 1			1
he would always remind all of us at @entity0 that we work for a " news " organization and when there 's breaking news , that takes priority			1
nowadays , that sounds so obvious , especially to all of us at @entity0 -- the world 's news leader when it comes to breaking news			1
but when he created the first 24/7 television news network on june 1 , 1980 , that concept was not so obvious			1
if you have a dream , pursue it			2
when he created @entity0 , a lot of folks thought he was crazy			1
the three broadcast networks already had a daily 30 - minute newscast			2
but @entity3 believed people in the @entity37 -- and indeed around the world -- wanted a lot more			1
he took what money he had and rolled the dice			0
he was , of course , right			0
there are now hundreds of local , national and international 24/7 cable news channels in dozens of languages around the world			1
in short , @entity3 did for television news what @entity48 and @entity49 did for computers and the @entity52			1
even after terrible life setbacks , you can recover and even thrive			0
@entity3 had a very unhappy childhood			2
his parents sent him away to boarding school when he was only 4			0
his father berated him for not getting into @entity59 and stopped paying his tuition at @entity61 because he did n't like @entity3 's major			1
later , his father committed suicide			0
still in his early 20s , @entity3 went on to take a local advertising business and create a worldwide media empire			2
at his peak , @entity3 was worth more than $ 10 billion			2
years later , @entity3 lost his media empire , and the love of his life , @entity70			1
even at his lowest point , he was able to turn things around and create a new business venture -- becoming a bison rancher and opening a chain of restaurants , which keeps him thriving and relevant today			0
a smart person has a lot of interests			0
@entity3 loves more than just the news			1
he loves entertainment -- he created @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , the @entity85 -- and sports			0
at one point , when he owned the @entity87 , he took them from last place to a @entity91 win			0
he also has a passion for protecting the environment and eliminating nuclear weapons			0
and he puts his money where his mouth is			0
he made a $ 1 billion pledge to the @entity98			0
do n't be afraid to admit you 've made mistakes			0
anyone who speaks with @entity3 will hear him acknowledge his many mistakes over the years -- from not being an attentive father to failing to understand what the @entity106 / @entity105 merger would mean for his involvement with his beloved @entity0			1
he has no role in @entity0 today			2
the great thing about @entity3 is that he knows where he erred and is willing to learn and improve			2
by sharing the good and bad of his life , he hopes others will learn as well .			0

@entity3 turns *75* years old this month
he founded @entity0 , the first 24 - hour cable news network , in 1980
in 1990 , @entity3 hired @entity118 , host of @entity0 's " @entity119 "
