@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity6 coroner 's office has subpoenaed medical records from 20 doctors in its investigation into actor @entity11 's death , a coroner investigator said			1
@entity11 , who died earlier this month , obtained drugs using prescriptions written under the names of these doctors in the past year , @entity6 deputy coroner @entity12 told @entity2 on friday			1
@entity1 drug investigators found evidence that @entity11 , who fought a decades - long battle with drug abuse , used at least one fake prescription to obtain a narcotic in the months before he died , @entity1 attorney general @entity17 said last week			1
the coroner is waiting for toxicology results before deciding if drugs were involved in the death of the 1980s teen movie actor , @entity12 said			1

an autopsy revealed that @entity11 , 38 , suffered from pneumonia , an enlarged heart and water in his lungs when he collapsed at his @entity0 home on march 10 , @entity12 said			1
" we get medical records all the time , " @entity12 said			0

" pharmacy records show the actor got thousands of potentially dangerous pills from multiple doctors in the past year , according to @entity17			0
state investigators know that @entity11 obtained " massive amounts " of legal drugs " in what looks to me like a questionable manner because of so many doctors , " @entity17 said			1

the ring involved the use of stolen identities from doctors to order official prescription pads , he said			2
" once they get that prescription pad in the doctor 's name , then they can write a prescription , or they can sell it to someone to write a prescription like @entity11 , " @entity17 said			2
" then he can go into the pharmacy and get his legal drugs illegally			0

@entity11 's most recent prescription was filled march 5 for @entity89 , he said			1
