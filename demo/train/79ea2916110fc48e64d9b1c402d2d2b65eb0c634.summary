after they knew they were safe , " i just had a feeling i need to go to town and bring my camera and either be prepared to take pictures or help people , " he told @entity22 at the time			2
@entity48 , a community manager for the @entity58 , spent the first weeks after the tornado helping remove debris and assisting friends			2
on nights and weekends throughout the summer , he documented the aftermath in photos , piecing together the magnitude of what had happened			0
and then , for a long time , he did n't want to look anymore			0
" quickly , it became a little too much for me emotionally , " he said			0
" after i was done taking the pictures , i did n't want to think about them for a while			0
there was so much pain and loss			0

" he plans to donate $ 5 from the sale of each book to two @entity3 nonprofits			1
