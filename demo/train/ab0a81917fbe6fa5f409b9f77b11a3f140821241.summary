-- think you have to pay a lot for a @entity4 's gift this year ? spare a thought for romantics in @entity7 , @entity8 , where florists charge $ 45 for just one rose			1
@entity7 , @entity11 and @entity12 are some of the more expensive places in which to buy red roses for @entity15 , according to an informal price check by @entity0 on thursday			1
a dozen premium @entity18 roses cost a whopping $ 487 in the @entity8 capital thursday			1
in @entity11 , a dozen roses cost $ 205 , and in @entity12 , they cost $ 120			2
the price was much cheaper in @entity22 -- just $ 15 for a 12 - stem bouquet of homegrown roses -- but buying a dozen is not the norm			1
in fact , there is a romantic meaning behind a whole range of numbers , giving @entity32 a range of ways to profess their love			0
one rose means " you 're the only one , " and three says " i love you			0
" sending 108 roses is equivalent to a marriage proposal , and 365 means " i think of you every day			2
" and for $ 1,516 , @entity43 shops were offering a total of 999 roses , which means " we 'll be together forever			2
" prices were cheaper elsewhere across @entity47			0
in @entity48 , @entity49 , and @entity50 , @entity51 , a dozen roses were going for $ 60 at florist shops thursday			2
a similar bouquet in @entity54 , @entity55 , cost only $ 9			1
by far the cheapest prices of the informal survey were in @entity58 , @entity59 , where 22 roses -- nearly two dozen -- cost about $ 2.50			1
that 's because @entity59 is a major rose producer and horticultural exporter			2
in 2008 , the value of @entity59 flower exports was nearly $ 500 million , according to the @entity66			0
the country shipped more than 93,000 tons of flowers that year , and annual growth has averaged more than 10 % for the past six years			0
almost all of @entity59 's flower exports -- 97 % -- are to @entity73 , the council says			1
but if it was @entity59 roses they were selling thursday at @entity79 's @entity78 department store , the cheap prices were n't filtering down to consumers			1
@entity78 was sold out of red roses thursday and other colors were costing between $ 58 and $ 96 per dozen			2
the @entity83 imports more than 80 % of its @entity15 roses , primarily from @entity85 and @entity86 , according to the @entity87			1
the vast majority of the rest come from @entity90			0
the reason so many come from abroad has to do with weather and timing , the society said			0
growers need 50 to 70 days to produce enough roses for @entity15 after the demand for red roses at @entity99 is filled			0
@entity101 's shorter daylight hours and higher energy costs hamper efforts to grow large rose crops			0
plus , in order to grow a single long - stemmed rose -- a @entity15 favorite -- growers have to nip off several rosebuds along the stem , reducing the total number of roses they can grow , the society said			0
the average @entity15 price for a dozen florist - arranged , long - stemmed roses in the @entity83 is just above $ 73 , according to the @entity87			1
at other times of the year , it 's just more than $ 59 .			0

the cheapest were found in @entity55 and @entity22
