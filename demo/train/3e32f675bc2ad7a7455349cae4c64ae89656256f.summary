-- the @entity2 government and rebels signed a ceasefire deal last thursday after more than a month of fighting that forced more than 600,000 people from their homes			1
but both sides have reported violations of the ceasefire , and it remains unclear if the truce will hold			0
the country erupted into violence on december 15 when rebels loyal to ousted vice president @entity16 tried to stage a coup			0
violence quickly spread , with reports of mass killings emerging nationwide			0
the conflict has been a huge blow for @entity2 , a far cry from the country president @entity25 declared in early december to be " open for business			2
" the world 's youngest nation remains under construction and as it tries to maintain a fragile peace it will also need to reassure investors and get its economy back on track			0
these are a few of the pivotal economic issues likely to affect @entity2 's trade and investment in the future			1
oil industry @entity2 is the world 's most oil - dependent nation , according to the @entity45 , accounting for almost all of the country 's exports and 80 % of gdp			1
the @entity51 government has invested heavily in the @entity2 oil industry and in 2012 , @entity51 pledged $ 8 billion in development loans for hydroelectricity and infrastructure projects following @entity25 's visit to @entity57			1
figures from the @entity59 reflect @entity2 's rapid rise			1
last year , the country , with an estimated population of 10.3 million , experienced astonishing growth of 24.7 %			2
before the conflict the economy was projected to grow 43 % in 2014			0
however , much of @entity2 's new - found wealth is yet to filter down to its people and after 20 years of civil war much of the population remains impoverished and half living below the poverty line , surviving in a subsistence economy			1
trade with neighbors @entity75 and @entity77 @entity2 has four major trading partners in the @entity79 -- @entity75 , @entity77 , @entity80 and @entity2			1
following a 2005 peace deal in @entity2 between the country 's government and the separatist movement in the south , trade began to increase between @entity2 -- then a region -- and neighboring @entity75			1
today , @entity2 is @entity75 's biggest export market with cement , vehicles , iron and steel making up the bulk of trade while in 2010 and 2011 , coffee generated revenues of $ 51.1 million , according to the @entity97			1
the country has also applied to join the @entity79 , a regional economic body , which encourages free trade between its members			0
@entity102 , chief executive of the @entity103 , an organization that represents foreign investors in the region , said that other countries were beginning to look to @entity2 as a strong trading partner			0
he said : " it 's a growing market for @entity77 goods			2
pretty much everything you get there is imported from or through @entity77 " including tobacco and tea			0
@entity115 the @entity117 project , first conceived in 1975 could help solve @entity2 's oil transportation problems , which are steeped in its hostile relations with @entity2			1
@entity117 -- or @entity120 and @entity122 - @entity121 -- is part of @entity77 's @entity125 plan and will include a network of roads , railway lines , oil refineries and pipelines running between @entity2 and @entity77 's @entity120 , on the @entity131			1
@entity2 took 75 % of @entity2 oil when it gained independence in 2011 , but much of the infrastructure needed to transport the oil for export remains under the control of the government in @entity139			2
this has stifled production and sparked disputes over revenues			0
@entity102 said regional cooperation , particularly with @entity2 , is still the " single biggest challenge " @entity2 faces in exploiting its oil reserves			2
" a pipeline takes a lot of time and money , " he said , " but with an agreement with @entity2 , at least that gives you revenues , which you can then borrow against to build another pipeline			0
" the @entity117 links would open up a vital artery for landlocked @entity2 to export its oil to the coast and offer a viable alternative to the current terminal at @entity160			2
@entity161 , director general of information for the government of @entity2 , believes it will take " up to five years " before the country can export through @entity75 and @entity77			1
@entity25 's government is also planning to construct 4,000 kilometers of new roads throughout the country and 248 kilometers of rail lines to connect the most remote areas , including @entity170 , with @entity75 and @entity77 networks			1
inflows of foreign investment foreign investors have flocked to the country in recent years , attracted by its vast untapped resources including oil and minerals			0
in @entity2 's investment report , the government states that it is aiming to diversify the nation 's economy away from oil as much as possible by investing in financial services , agriculture and fisheries			1
@entity161 said any investors deterred by the violence will not stay away for long			0
" investors will come back , " he said , " they have made commitments here and they can see they can see the potential			0
" but @entity2 will have its work cut out regaining their trust and reassuring them that the country is a secure place to do business			2
