can animals go to heaven ? some people all over the world have been excited in recent days about reports by news agencies worldwide -- including one from @entity6 -- declaring that @entity7 apparently believes they can			1
it turns out it 's unclear what he believes about this			1
a previous pope , @entity14 , had no doubts			1
" one day we will again see our animals in the eternity of @entity22 , " @entity14 once told a boy grieving the loss of his pet			1
that quote , from the pontiff who reigned from 1963 until his death in 1978 , was inaccurately attributed to @entity7			2
the confusion may have begun when @entity28 daily newspaper @entity27 referred to @entity14 's quote in a story that carried the headline , " the pope and animals : ' @entity34 is open to all creatures			1
' " the story itself does not indicate @entity7 said that			2
instead , it refers back to @entity14			2
the writer for the newspaper pointed to something @entity7 actually did say : " @entity43 teaches us that the fulfillment of this marvelous plan can not but involve everything that surrounds us and came from the heart and mind of @entity50			1
" that remark , the writer suggested , " widened the hope of salvation " to animals and all of creation			0
the headline on the article quoted @entity7 as saying , " @entity34 is open to all creatures			0
" but there 's no sign @entity7 said that			2
a search through the current @entity7 's writings and remarks showed no immediate sign that he has taken a clear position on the question			1
pope @entity7 to visit @entity68 for first time next fall while @entity71 teachings neither reject nor reaffirm the notion that animals have souls			1
there is no hard - and - fast answer in @entity71 to this question			0
drugs , capitalism , homosexuality -- little is off limits for outspoken @entity7 it 's an emotional question for many people			2
@entity84 of @entity85 , @entity86 , shared an anecdote from her childhood on friday			0
when she was 10 years old , death claimed her beloved cat , @entity91			0
her father had tears in his eyes when he told her , " now @entity95			0
the @entity97 says the @entity98 sees even every sparrow that falls , " @entity84 wrote on @entity96			0
" if he sees every sparrow , he 's not going to forget about a good old kitty like @entity91			0
' " " i 've held that in my heart ever since , " she wrote .			0

it was pope @entity14 , not @entity7 , who said animals can go to heaven
it 's unclear where @entity7 *stands* on the issue
an @entity28 newspaper says @entity7 ' remarks suggest he *agrees*
