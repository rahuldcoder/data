-- it turns out going to the moon is a tough act to follow			1
astronaut @entity4 walks on the moon during the @entity7 mission in 1969			1
for all their @entity14 , " @entity13 , " history - making achievements , the question for many of the 12 astronauts who walked on the lunar surface starting four decades ago ultimately became " one giant leap to where , exactly ? " " you have your peak experience at 38 or 39 , " says space historian @entity17 , summing up their collective experience , " and [ they ] have a hard time coming up with something to do for an encore			1
" @entity7 lifted off from @entity26 , @entity27 , on july 16 , 1969			2
four days later , the first two humans walked on the lunar surface ; 10 more americans followed by the end of 1972			1
in the 40 years since the @entity34 first took humans to the moon , the astronauts ' lives have taken diverse paths			1
almost all had been military test pilots before joining @entity40 ; in later life , they found themselves ministers , politicians and conspiracy buffs			2
some struggled with common issues : many of their marriages fell apart and alcoholism affected at least one			2
in possibly the most extreme case of @entity52 readjustment , @entity4 -- the second human being to set foot on the moon -- became a car salesman in @entity57			1
" not very successfully , " the 79 - year old @entity4 quickly acknowledges			1
the @entity7 lunar module pilot 's post-flight battles against depression and alcoholism have been well - documented , most recently in his own memoir , " @entity63			2
" as for a brief stint hawking cadillacs in the late 1970s , @entity4 told @entity0 , " most people who have received a degree of public recognition find themselves financially pretty well off			1
does n't happen to be the case with astronauts			2
" others took more existential , even spiritual , approaches to dealing with their lunar experiences			2
@entity74 pilot @entity73 left @entity40 and became a baptist minister			0
@entity77 crewman @entity76 spent years investigating possible extraterrestrial life ; in april , he went public with claims of a government cover - up			0
@entity83 moonwalker @entity82 , now 77 , has spent the intervening decades since his 1969 landing putting his impressions of the lunar experience on canvas			0
" that 's @entity92 " is the title of one his paintings , which now fetch starting - prices of $ 20,000			0
" these paintings are the only paintings in history from anywhere else but this @entity96 , " @entity82 told @entity0			0
not all the @entity34 astronauts ' post-flight journeys have been so ethereal			0
@entity100 's first man in space , @entity99 , who later walked on the moon in 1971 's @entity77 mission , became a millionaire businessman			1
@entity34 17 's @entity105 -- a geologist at the time , and the only scientist to make the lunar journey -- served a term as @entity100 senator from @entity110 , but was defeated in a run for re-election in 1982			1
@entity7 command module pilot @entity113 served as a top official at the @entity115 and its @entity116			0
and the first man to leave footprints in the lunar dust , @entity34 11 commander @entity120 -- aside from geologist @entity105 , the only other civilian in the collection of moonwalkers -- later sat on several corporate boards and the presidential commission that investigated the 1986 challenger space shuttle disaster			1
@entity120 is also known for a series of disputes over autographs , which he long ago stopped signing because he discovered his signature was being sold for profit			1
he also sued @entity132 in 1994 for featuring his famous " one small step " quote in a space - themed @entity135 ornament			1
news reports say the suit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount			0
@entity120 's haircuts also became famous			1
in 2005 , he threatened legal action after learning his longtime barber had sold a lock of his hair for $ 3,000			0
all part of the territory , says @entity17			0
his book " @entity149 " is based upon interviews with the surviving @entity34 astronauts , and he concludes there 's no " lunar syndrome " that 's sent the moonwalkers down paths odder than any dozen former colleagues in other lines of work			1
" i think the whole subject of the effects of going to the moon is something that gets overstated , " @entity17 says			2
if there is a common emotion among the astronauts , four decades after the @entity34 achievement , it may be simple disappointment over space exploration -- or the lack of it			0
" it 's all fallen apart , " @entity4 says , talking about what may prove a half - century gap between @entity100 lunar landings			1
" we have just taken the wrong pathway			0
" @entity17 agrees this is a near - universal astronaut refrain			0
" they really have never expected that it would be this long			0
that here we would be -- 40 years after the first moon landing -- still wondering when humans will return to the moon			2
i think they 're all frustrated by that			0
" @entity0 's @entity185 contributed to this report .			0
