-- the state visit of the president of @entity4 , @entity5 to @entity6 this week is the culmination of a series of contacts at head of state level over 21 years , the most important of which was the successful state visit by @entity12 and the @entity13 to @entity4 in may 2011			1
i had been surprised to learn , in the spring of 1991 , that as the seventh president of @entity16 i would become the first to visit @entity6 as president			1
it is difficult to believe now but no previous @entity16 president in the history of the state had traveled to " mainland " @entity6 for official business			1
there was a problem , for example , with how to describe me			0
because of @entity4 , the @entity6 would not agree to call me " president of @entity16 " ! the occasion of my visit was to accept an honorary degree from @entity31 , conferred by its chancellor , the @entity13 and join president @entity33 in @entity34 to decide on the logo and values for the @entity37			1
this was one illustration of the fact that relations between the two countries were not normal because of the disputed claims at the time by @entity6 and @entity4 over @entity4			2
my first meeting with @entity12 occurred in may 1993 when she invited my husband @entity46 and me to take tea in @entity48			0
this was neither a " state visit " or an " official visit " ; it was a sui generis , carefully orchestrated meeting at head - of - state level between two countries with a troubled past seeking , in a symbolic way , to begin reconciling			1
we both understood the symbolism of that moment , captured in photographs of the two women heads of state smiling @entity62			0
in 1995 i joined the @entity12 for an event in @entity65 , @entity34 , commemorating the 150th anniversary of the @entity67 which had been established in @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 ( although only @entity68 retains that name and original structure )			0
in june 1996 i was honored to be invited on an official visit to @entity6 by prime minister @entity74 , which included a lunch with @entity12 and @entity77 , preceded by an inspection of the guard of honor at @entity48			2
that was the most emotional moment for me , standing beside the @entity12 and hearing the @entity16 national anthem played			2
president @entity82 had a number of opportunities to strengthen the personal relationship in meetings with @entity12 during her 14 years as president and ultimately was her host for that memorable state visit in 2011			1
there is understandable anticipation on both sides of the @entity93 for the return state visit of @entity5 to @entity6 next week			1
during and since my presidency of @entity4 , a difficult peace process was undertaken and came to fruition			0
i remember hosting a lunch in my official residence in 1995 for senator @entity99 , who had been asked by @entity101 president @entity100 to help organize an economic conference in @entity68 , so that those still fighting in the streets there might begin to think of a future peace dividend			0
later @entity99 's role changed to that of an effective mediator at the beginning of the peace process			0
the @entity112 was signed during the first year of @entity82 's presidency and , being from @entity4 , she was able to support in symbolic and diplomatic ways the further progress in establishing peace and shared political power in @entity4			0
@entity118 and cultural relations between the two countries intensified during this period , helped by the fact that both countries are members of the @entity125 and share many common interests			0
important amendments were made to the @entity16 constitution , which requires a referendum of the people , that both permitted the state to comply with the @entity112 and provided for the removal of the " territorial claim " contained in @entity135			2
the @entity4 referendum , to approve the agreement was held on the same day as the @entity16 referendum thereby symbolizing that the citizens of the land had the power to realize a change			2
as the relationships at all levels improved there was a growing pressure for this to be recognized at the highest state level , and we are about to witness the final act in that formal process			0
in my current work as @entity154 special envoy to the @entity155 in @entity156 , i am required to be in @entity157 at the time of the state visit next week , marking the 20th anniversary of the terrible genocide in that country			1
when i can , i will be glued to a television set , hoping to see coverage of a state visit that will evoke many memories and bring about the full normalization of the relations between two close and historic neighbors			1
