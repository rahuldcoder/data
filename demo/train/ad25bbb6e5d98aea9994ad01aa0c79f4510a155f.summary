-- in @entity3 in 1968 , anti-war protesters at the @entity2 chanted " @entity4			0
" world news events of the past had few reporting electronically , but hundreds are in @entity9			1
they were talking about television cameras that showed police beatings on the evening news			0
more than 40 years later , with a massive movement aimed at reversing election results and possibly even toppling a regime in @entity9 , online networking is instantly sharing protesters ' actions			1
and the whole world is watching			1
" that was n't true in @entity3 , " @entity21 , a writer , consultant and @entity24 instructor who focuses on the social impact of the @entity26 , said of the slogan			1
" now , it 's true			2
" the watching is n't the end of the story -- and may not even end up being its most important piece -- according to @entity21			2
" since we do n't know how this ends , the lessons are all provisional at the moment , " he said			0
" but it seems to me that the biggest potential difference right now is not just that the whole world is watching , but that people from outside -- civilians from outside -- @entity9 are trying to actually affect the outcome			1
" from the moment @entity9 took to the streets of @entity46 to protest results of an election they believe president @entity50 stole , electronic media has been a part of the story			1
demonstrators made plans by text message -- when they could get around reported government interference with their signals			0
web sites like @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 were used to organize , drum up support and share images of street protests -- and the brutal retribution that sometimes followed -- with a world hungry for news			2
as the @entity9 government began limiting the freedom of traditional news outlets to report in the country , citizen journalists became crucial in showing scenes from the movement			1
it 's the latest step forward in a media technology march that has included stops at the @entity79 , when telegraphs wired updates to the world , and the @entity83 , when television first gave viewers a daily look at how the conflict was going			1
" every new technology gives those at home , or for that matter in the war rooms , a different way [ to see ] and perhaps a larger perspective on what 's out there , " said @entity88 , director of the @entity90 's @entity89 and the @entity91			2
" in @entity102 , you might have had two or three networks out there covering it -- you could count on your fingers the number of perspectives on what was going on , " she said			0
" today , you have the ability to literally have hundreds , if not hundreds of thousands , of perspectives from people not only of different geographical perspectives , but also from different cultural and philosophical perspectives			0
" @entity88 said online networking sites like @entity60 and @entity59 have " come into flowering " since even the most recent world events , like natural disasters or political upheavals , that have garnered widespread attention			1
the growing number of people becoming web - savvy makes the online networks more powerful , she said			2
" it 's not just the half - dozen geeks that used to be part of the ham radio network , but millions of people have figured out how to sign up at @entity59 and can get to [ opposition candidate @entity131 ] @entity133 's @entity59 site			2
" @entity134 , a blogger and self - professed " new media geek " living in @entity136 , is among those who have tuned in to the action in @entity9 through online media			1
in a blog thursday titled , " @entity141 : it 's not about @entity60 , it 's not about us , " she noted the important role the @entity26 has played in spreading the word and engaging the public			1
but at the end of the day , she said , the online tools are just that -- tools			2
and the real story is the massive , nonvirtual movement in @entity9			1
" i love @entity60 and all that stuff ... but it 's not all about us , " she said to @entity0 thursday			0
" we would n't be paying attention on @entity60 if it were not for thousands and possibly millions of people in the street			0
" helping free up internet access for @entity9 creates a way for people all over the world to show support for those protesters from the comfort of their own homes , @entity21 said			1
" one of the easy criticisms to make of people on @entity59 and @entity60 is , ' you 're changing your avatar picture to green [ the color @entity133 supporters wear ]			0
is n't that sweet ? how pointless , " he said			0
" but one of the things that emboldens people turning out in the streets is visible evidence that there 's an audience outside their immediate area			0
" the online activism does raise some unanswered questions , though , according to @entity21			0
he said some of them are troubling			0
he noted that some of the @entity189 working to help @entity9 dissidents fight their own government were among those who criticized former @entity189 president @entity192 for pushing for regime change in neighboring @entity194			1
" it 's a kind of civilian diplomacy , " he said			1
" the regime will certainly use this as evidence of @entity189 meddling and it is @entity189 meddling , " he said			0
" it 's just not meddling by the @entity189 state			0
" the anonymity of online citizen journalism also presents problems for people trying to process the news			0
while some bloggers and frequent users of networking sites have become trusted names among followers of news out of @entity9 , it can be otherwise difficult to figure out who the source of a piece of information is			1
" it puts a demand on the person at home to make sense of it , " @entity88 said			0
" and to be able to add some context and so forth			0
" suspicion of intentional misinformation from the @entity9 government also has rippled through the networks			1
for example , a @entity60 user claiming to be an @entity9 student was posting misinformation wednesday -- including a report that demonstrations had been canceled -- and listed a phone number for a supposed safe house for protesters			2
and while it 's impossible to deny the game - changing impact the @entity26 is having on the @entity9 situation , there 's no guarantee it will help topple @entity9 's hard - line leadership , according to @entity88			1
" it does n't mean we 're going to see the brand new day of @entity9 dawning , " she said			2
" but the technology is there to stay			0
you ca n't pull the plug on the @entity26			2

*future* impact of " civilian diplomacy " online is *unknown* , *expert* says
