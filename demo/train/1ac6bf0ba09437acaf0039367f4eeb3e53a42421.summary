most people like to know what they are eating			0
however , labeling for genetically modified organisms is not required in any state			0
this is largely because of the money expended by @entity8 seed producers toward blocking food - labeling laws			1
a common claim made by this group is that @entity8 foods have been proved safe to eat and that there is a global scientific consensus to support this statement ; therefore , no labeling is needed			1
however , an examination of the scientific data , along with discussions on this topic in other countries , show that both claims are blatantly false			0
what is the evidence that some @entity8 foods are hazardous to human health and that consumers should be able to make a choice based upon this information ? when gmos were introduced nearly 20 years ago , there was the promise of crops with increased yields and resistant to flooding and salt			1
since then , traditional breeding methods have created commercial varieties with these traits , while genetic engineering has created none			0
for example , recently published data show that conventional breeding of corn and soy increases yields to a greater extent than @entity8 technologies			2
with the promise of reducing the use of agricultural chemicals , most of the current @entity8 crops are supposedly either insect or herbicide resistant			2
in reality , @entity8 crops have fostered an epidemic of herbicide resistant weeds and insects that are no longer killed by the built - in toxins			2
the result is a massive increase in herbicide use -- an additional 527 million pounds over the past 16 years			0
the major herbicide , glyphosate , is found inside the @entity8 plants we eat , leading to its detection in people			1
future @entity8 crops will likely trigger a greater use of more toxic herbicides such as @entity72 , a component of the @entity75 defoliant deployed in @entity76			0
in addition to these problems , there is increasing evidence that @entity8 crops and the chemicals required for their production are harmful to humans			1
an @entity86 story in october documented the large increase in cancer and birth defects in commercial farming areas of @entity91 since the introduction of @entity8 crops			0
these data confirm recent animal studies showing that @entity8 corn and the herbicides sprayed on it caused a dramatic increase in cancer in the same strain of rats used in @entity102 drug safety tests			2
another large study showed an increase in severe stomach inflammation in pigs caused by @entity8 feed containing insecticidal toxins , a condition that would likely lead to cancer in humans			0
since it takes many years for diseases such as cancer to appear , we could be reaching that point in time after the introduction of @entity8 crops			0
what has been the reaction in the rest of the world to this and similar information ? the @entity121 has tightened its @entity8 food safety testing requirements as consumers continue to reject @entity8 foods , resulting in the withdrawal of investment from two large @entity8 seed producers , @entity127 and @entity128			1
@entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , the @entity132 and @entity133 have issued moratoria on @entity8 food crops to go along with @entity136 , @entity137 and a large number of other countries			1
scientists in @entity141 have proposed a total ban on all @entity8 products			0
and @entity144 , which initially embraced the technology , is having an extended debate about @entity8 crops			0
the world 's food authority , @entity147 , agreed in 2011 that @entity8 food labels are justified to trace back any adverse health effects of @entity151			1
as a result of these new revelations about gm technology , the industry is making a major public relations effort to promote itself , often falsely claiming that there is a " consensus " among scientists that the technology is safe			2
in reality , there is no evidence that @entity8 food is safe for human consumption , nor is there any consensus on this topic within the scientific community			1
it is critical for the public to educate itself about the realities of gmos and not be fooled by the rhetoric from companies that sell it			1
most of the world has studied this issue and concluded that @entity151 are not worth the risk			0
passing @entity8 labeling initiatives in states will be the initial demonstration that the public understands what is at stake			1
at the very least , labeling may help reverse the unsustainable trend in this country towards ever increasing industrial @entity151 farming .			2

@entity193 : seed producers say there 's scientific consensus on @entity151 safety
@entity193 : there is no evidence that @entity8 food is safe for human consumption
he says @entity8 labeling will allow consumers to make an informed choice about what they eat
@entity193 : it is critical for the public to educate itself about the realities of @entity151
