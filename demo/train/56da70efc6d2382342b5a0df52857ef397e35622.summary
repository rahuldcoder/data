@entity1 's 4 - year - old brother wanted an easy - bake oven for months and she was more than happy to get it for him			1
she wants him to know it 's ok for boys to enjoy baking cookies			1
but she 's worried that toy makers are sending boys a different message			1
the 13 - year - old reached this conclusion last week during a shopping trip with her parents			1
they searched the shelves for an @entity16 and found pink and purple boxes that show only girls using the kid - friendly appliance			1
they decided not to buy it because they thought the packaging would make him feel like he was playing with a " girl 's toy " he would n't want			1
still , @entity28 decided to take it up as a cause and launched a petition asking @entity32 to feature boys in the packaging of @entity35			1
" i feel that this sends a clear message : women cook , men work , " @entity1 wrote in her change.org petition , which has earned more than 30,000 signatures since it went up friday night			1
" i want my brother to know that it 's not ' wrong ' for him to want to be a chef , that it 's okay to go against what society believes to be appropriate			2
" with more people shopping for children 's toys during the holiday season , @entity28 and others are reviving debate over the effects of gender - biased toy marketing in a year that has seen intense discussion on the issue and even some progress			1
it 's easier for girls to play across gender lines , said @entity28 , who spoke from experience			2
when she played with @entity65 guns , people called her a tomboy , at worst , she said			0
but she has seen male classmates endure harsher name - calling for playing with dolls			2
" i 'm sure there are a lot of kids out there like my brother who want @entity35 ovens but do n't ask for them because they 're told they 're not supposed to want them , " she said			1
" there 's a lot toys specifically marketed towards boys and girls , but guys need to learn to cook and take care of children , too			2
" @entity32 did not respond to a request for comment			1
not everyone believes children should play across gender lines			2
in a previous @entity90 story on the topic , some commenters said that allowing children boys to play with dolls or other toys typically associated with girls could make them targets of bullies			2
others suggested that some color - coded marketing works and that selling pink @entity100 or science kits packaged in purple attracts girls to toys that they might shy away from otherwise			2
toys come in different colors based on feedback from consumers and retailers , said a spokeswoman for the @entity110 , a non-profit trade association that represents businesses involved in the creation and marketing of toys			0
" toy companies are basically businesses that respond to consumer requests , " spokeswoman @entity115 said			2
" if there 's a market to explore , a company is going to want to put their marketing efforts behind products that families are going to buy			0
" comments on the petition echoed @entity28 's views about how the packaging and marketing might enforce gender stereotypes			1
some parents , including men , agreed with her statement that boys benefit from playing with kid - friendly appliances and other toys typically associated with girls			1
" i loved my easy - bake oven when i was a boy and i love cooking today			2
all boys should have access to the kitchen			2
and it 's never too early to let them have that access , " one commenter wrote			0
" this goes for craft kits , too ! my son ( also loves cooking ) , has shown an interest in sewing , yet the kits out there are all geared toward girls			0
cooking and sewing are basic life skills that all our children should learn ... especially when they show an interest , " another commenter wrote			0
activists are heartened that a teen is speaking up on behalf of a sibling , rather than the usual advocates and opinion writers			1
@entity28 's voice lends credibility to the argument that traditional gender stereotypes are losing relevance among her generation , said @entity171 , co-founder of @entity172 , a nonprofit group that trains teens and young women to be media activists			1
" people really listen when it comes from a young person or the actual consumer			0
it 's different from adults making arguments in sophisticated words , " @entity171 said			0
" how can you ignore young people when they say they do n't like what you 're selling them and they want choices ? it 's pretty much a win - win situation for the advertiser and the consumer			0
" it 's an issue close to @entity172 , whose teen activists have orchestrated several campaigns in the past year to raise awareness of portrayals of women in media and popular culture			1
last november , they launched a petition over @entity100 's busty , pinkwashed " friends " line asking the company to return to its gender - neutral approach to marketing			1
@entity172 's efforts continued in 2012 by pressuring @entity210 and @entity211 to stop photoshopping models			0
the fact that @entity28 did it on her own -- as she and her mother claim -- shows that people her age are capable of scrutinizing media messages , said @entity218 , executive director of @entity172			0
" it matters most when it comes from them because they 're the future leaders of the world who will be making decisions about marketing and advertising , " @entity218 said			0
" so many people like to say , ' who cares ? girls will always play with dolls and boys will always play with trucks and it does n't matter			0
' so , it 's encouraging to see someone who 's not an adult stand up and say ' wait a minute , actually , it does matter			0
' " toy marketing saw a shift this year when @entity243 store @entity241 's re-opened its toy department organized by themes rather than gender			1
more recently , @entity249 's @entity248 , a licensee of the @entity247 brand , published a catalog featuring a girl aiming a toy gun and a boy styling hair with beauty accessories			0
the gender - blind catalog prompted @entity257 to start her own @entity259 petition asking @entity247 to follow suit in its catalogs and marketing materials in the @entity263			1
the company did not respond to a request for comment			0
" people are recognizing that the divisions being created are n't necessary and it just makes more sense to be sorting toys thematically rather than by gender , " said @entity257 , founder of " a @entity267 , " an online marketplace for books and movies that feature females as main characters			0
" we hear from parents all the time who see the value in allowing boys to play with baby dolls , " she said			0
" a lot of people believe that it 's desirable to encourage boys to become nurturers and develop the whole child , from analytical skills to the ability to empathize			0
" since launching the petition , @entity28 said she has learned a bit about scrutinizing ads. " now , whenever i see a toy commercial , i feel my mind automatically shooting to : ' why are they marketing it this way ? ' " she said			1
" i ca n't help it			0
i wonder who this is being marketing to -- should they do it in a different way ? " follow @entity90 living on @entity306 and @entity307 on @entity308			0

@entity311 teen asks @entity32 to use boys on packaging for @entity35
@entity1 says packaging *discourages* boys from baking , enforces gender stereotypes
@entity1 , 13 , launched @entity259 petition on behalf of 4 - year - old brother who asked for the toy
activists glad that a teen is speaking up rather than usual advocates and opinion writers
