@entity0 -- airline passengers can expect to see as well as feel new pat - down procedures at @entity6 airports over the coming weeks in an effort to provide another layer of security for travelers , the @entity2 said thursday			1
" pat - downs are one important tool to help @entity2 detect hidden and dangerous items such as explosives , " according to a @entity2 statement sent to @entity1			1
the @entity2 said passengers should continue to expect " an unpredictable mix of security layers that include explosives trace detection , advanced imaging technology , canine teams , among others			2
" but it 's the hands - on procedures that have at least one traveler concerned that the @entity2 may be going too far			1
@entity26 , a @entity1 employee , said she was subjected to a pat - down at the @entity28 , @entity29 , airport on wednesday night after her underwire bra set off a magnetometer			1
she said she was taken to a private area and searched , with transportation screening officers telling her the pat - down was a new procedure			1
according to @entity26 , a female screener ran her hands around her breasts , over her stomach , buttocks and her inner thighs , and briefly touched her crotch			0
" i felt helpless , i felt violated , and i felt humiliated , " @entity26 said , adding that she was reduced to tears at the checkpoint			0
she particularly objected to the fact that travelers were not warned about the new procedures			0
@entity26 sent an e-mail complaint about her experience to the @entity2 that said the agency needs to get the word out so that travelers know their rights			2
the @entity2 employees " conducted themselves in a professional manner , so my complaint is not about them professionally , " @entity26 wrote			2
she told the @entity2 the agency needs to get the word out so the travelers know their rights			2
" i am appalled and disgusted at the new search procedures and the fact that passengers have not been made aware of the new invasive steps prior to entering the security area , " @entity26 wrote			0
" it appears once you enter the security area , passengers forfeit their rights			0
there were no signs , video information , etc. at the entrance of the security area the airport			0
why ? " she added : " as an experienced traveler for work who was in tears for most of the search process , i have never experienced a more traumatic and invasive travel event ! " the @entity2 sent an automated initial e-mail response to @entity26 saying , " thank you for your inquiry to the @entity2			1
we have forwarded your e-mail to the appropriate group for response			0
" in its statement to @entity1 , the @entity2 said : " @entity93 procedures are used to resolve alarms that occur at a walk - through metal detector , if an anomaly is detected during screening with advanced imaging technology or during random screening			1
" the statement also indicated that " passengers who opt out of advanced imaging technology screening will receive alternate screening to include a thorough pat - down			1
" @entity1 's @entity104 and @entity105 contributed to this story .			0
