president @entity0 called for a " sustained conversation " surrounding the relationship between police and the communities they serve after a series of meetings with @entity8 members , law enforcement officials , young activists and others on monday			1
the meetings follow a week of sometimes violent protests that swept the nation following the decision by a grand jury last monday not to indict a white police officer in the shooting of an unarmed black teenager in @entity19 , @entity20			1
later on monday , attorney general @entity22 , speaking in @entity21 , said the federal investigation of the incident is ongoing			2
" the @entity26 's investigation into the shooting death of @entity28 , as well as our investigation into allegations of unconstitutional policing patterns or practices by the @entity34 , remain ongoing and active , " he said			0
" they have been rigorous and independent from the very beginning			0
" members of the @entity38 also spoke out on @entity19 and broader racial tensions in the @entity40			1
" the @entity19 grand jury 's decision not to indict former officer @entity43 was yet another slap in our face			2
it was a painful reminder that just like with @entity47 and @entity48 and so many others that law enforcement officers killed - black and brown men and boys - without repercussions , " said rep. @entity50 , @entity51 , chair of the @entity38 , the @entity53 floor			2
" the fact that our country - the greatest country in the world - remains mired in race relations issues in the year 2014 is an embarrassment , " she said			0
" if we are to learn anything from the tragic death of @entity28 , we must first acknowledge that we have a race issue that we are not addressing			0
" the incident , and subsequent months of unrest in @entity19 , set off a national debate over the tactics and tools used by law enforcement to keep the peace , which critics said were at times too aggressive			2
according to the @entity53 press pool report , @entity0 told a crowd of about 50 activists , law enforcement and elected officials that the problem is " solvable , " but that there needs to be an ongoing discussion of the issues uncovered by @entity19			1
" [ this is ] not a problem simply of @entity19 , this is a problem that is national			2
it is a solvable problem , but it is one that unfortunately spikes but fades into background , " he said			0
" what we need is a sustained conversation ... to move forward in a constructive fashion			0
" @entity0 held his first meeting with members of his cabinet -- @entity22 , treasury secretary @entity98 , homeland security secretary @entity99 attended , as well as deputy defense secretary @entity100 and @entity101 , the acting director of the @entity102			1
they discussed a review @entity0 ordered in august of federal funding and programs that provide equipment to state and local law enforcement agencies , according to the @entity53			1
a @entity53 official confirms a presidential trip to @entity19 was indeed under consideration last week after @entity0 was asked by @entity113 about the possibility of such a visit just as the unrest was flaring up again in the @entity20 city			1
but because the issues that arose in @entity19 are more widespread than one incident in one community , the official said , @entity53 advisers decided on what is described as a more comprehensive approach of convening a large group of stakeholders from cities around the country to tackle the issue in a more thorough manner			1
a trip to @entity19 has not been ruled out in the future			1
but it appears for now , the @entity53 is opting for the route they are taking this week.â € ‹ during his remarks monday afternoon , @entity0 admitted that past task forces have fallen short , but said that " this time will be different because the president of the @entity40 is deeply vested in making it different			1
" related : @entity0 preparing executive order on police militarization following his @entity8 meeting , @entity0 hosted a group of young civil rights leaders â € ” including representatives from the @entity147 and the @entity148 â € ” in the @entity149 to discuss , per the @entity53 , " the broader challenges we still face as a nation , including the mistrust between law enforcement and communities of color			1
" and he then sat down with elected officials , law enforcement officials and community , civil rights and faith leaders from around the nation to discuss ways to " build trust " between communities and law enforcement			1
that meeting included the mayors of @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 , @entity176 , as well as representatives from a number of police organizations and both the @entity181 and @entity175 police departments			2
the rev. @entity182 was in attendance as well , along with representatives from the @entity185 , the @entity186 , the @entity187 and others			0
@entity182 called it an " historic evening , " and said he came away with the sense that the president and the administration are putting their weight behind their groups ' recommendations			0
he did caution , however , that this meeting can not be " an isolated incident " and needs to be followed by action			0
@entity202 president @entity201 said the meeting was unlike any other he 's participated in and featured " candid , open , productive , substantive conversation			0
" he called today 's actions from the president " meaningful			0
" @entity22 is also set to address the events in @entity19 during a monday night forum at @entity209 in @entity21 , @entity210 , a church where @entity211 once preached			1
civic leaders , students , community leaders and others have been invited to the forum , and @entity22 plans to give remarks afterward			0
the day 's events come as protests continue into their second week			0
on monday , protesters snarled traffic throughout @entity221 by blocking main roadways across the city , according to the @entity224 .			0
