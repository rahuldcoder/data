at long last , " @entity1 " fans got to see the first episode of " @entity4 " on sunday night			1
the spinoff 's much - hyped premiere started off slowly , with a downright depressing look at a defeated @entity8 ( @entity9 ) , working at a @entity10 , reminiscing about the good old days of his law firm			1
then we flashed back to 2002 to see @entity14 -- as @entity8 used to be known -- struggling to keep clients and pay the bills between issues with his brother , @entity18 , and some skateboarding twins who reminded him of his con - artist days			0
when @entity14 teamed up with the twins to basically bribe a potential client into signing with him , things went horribly awry , with a hit - and - run and @entity14 ultimately taken at gunpoint , a cliffhanger to be resolved on monday night 's episode			2
there were a few shout - outs to " @entity1 , " in particular the character of @entity32 , but this show is more of a balance of comedy and drama than the critically acclaimed " @entity1			1
" much of it rests on the performance of @entity39 as @entity14 , and he delivered an @entity41 - worthy performance here			0
we ca n't wait to see what 's to come			0
critics loved it -- the show stands at 100 % on @entity46 -- and fans on @entity48 responded rapturously .			0
