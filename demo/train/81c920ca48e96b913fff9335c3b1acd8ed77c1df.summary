-- beach volleyball played on sun - kissed @entity3 sand conjures up many images in the mind			1
but beach tennis ? what 's that all about ? @entity10 is on a mission to change that perception as he muscles in on a sport -- think elements of the court mixed with those of volleyball -- that has been traditionally dominated by @entity19			1
" everybody told me i was crazy when i started practicing my ass off , because there 's no money in it , " the @entity3 , who is the the first non-italian to top the world rankings , tells @entity0 's @entity23 series			1
" but i saw the @entity19 playing and i said , ' i can play like them			0
' " i started working hard for this			0
i would go on the beach with coconuts and trash cans and put them as targets for the serves and do sprints			2
" then my craziness got people -- more crazy people -- around me , so i started teaching beach tennis			1
" a popular pastime for nearly a century , the game was not formalized as a competitive endeavor until the 1990s by @entity19 @entity45			2
unlike conventional tennis , the beach version does not allow the ball to hit the ground			1
as in volleyball , players serve and volley it over the raised net , diving around the sand to keep it in play with their paddle - like rackets			0
" in the beginning i did n't like the game that much because it was quite slow			2
but then i tried more , and i saw the game evolving and i just fell in love with it , " @entity10 says			1
" i found a coach , the @entity19 guy who brought the game to @entity3			1
we share an apartment and he 's been helping me since i started			0
" in 2013 @entity69 helped @entity3 become the first team apart from @entity19 to win the world title , and this season he has spent a month as the sport 's no. 1 player -- a year ahead of the goal he 'd set himself			1
" everything happened really quickly , and i got a glance of what it feels like to be no. 1 -- and i want to be back there			1
" it 's a far cry from when he started out in the sport			0
@entity10 used to go to work in @entity83 in the morning , then in the afternoon he 'd skip lunch and travel 40 minutes across @entity85 to @entity86 , train with his coach , before heading back home to work until 10 p.m. " i played tennis my entire life , " @entity10 says			1
" in 2008 a friend told me that there was this sport coming to @entity3			1
that i should try it because serve and volley is all i can do in tennis , so you can be good at this			2
" @entity10 made his life easier by moving to @entity101 , and now has a team supporting him : two coaches , a nutritionist , a physical trainer , a @entity108 trainer , a psychologist			2
he can now look back and laugh at his early efforts in the sport , starting from his first serve in a proper tournament			0
" the ball hit the side of the racket and went straight in the water			0
that was terrible , terrible			0
but funny , " @entity10 recalls with a smile , breaking into laughter as he does throughout the interview			2
" my coach says that the way i play , it 's very stupid -- and smart at the same time			0
stupid because many times i do the wrong shot , but i believe so much that it actually ends up working , so that 's the smart part of it			0
" in order to play beach tennis , you have to be fast			1
not only in the legs , but in the reactions			0
" you have to jump high , and you have to be prepared to commit mistakes , because mistakes happen every game			0
" on the tour , @entity10 regularly partners @entity136 in men 's doubles ; the @entity19 is ranked just below him in fourth , while world champions @entity140 and @entity142 have returned to joint top			1
" the thing i love the most in beach tennis is the friendship you can have with other players			1
in tennis , i never had that , " @entity10 says			2
" sometimes i had very bad arguments , sometimes got in fights in tennis			0
in beach tennis i 've never been even close to this			1
" we shake hands when we cross sides			0
win a tournament , lose a tournament in the final , we go out , we have a drink , we have a beer , we have a talk			0
" @entity10 admits he has been seeking help from his psychologist to calm down his on - court attitude			2
" i would get frustrated when my partner would make a mistake , and i would react really bad towards my partner , " he says .			0

@entity10 is the first non-italian player to be ranked no. 1 in beach tennis
last year he helped @entity3 to become the first other nation to win world title
he *initially* played normal tennis , but took up the beach version in 2008
@entity10 believes the game is worthy of a *future* place at the @entity183
