@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 galvanizes protestors to attend mass demonstrations ; 1.8 million @entity6 sign an online petition , leading to widespread press coverage and government embarrassment ; and @entity10 and @entity11 are fighting it out for the @entity13 nomination on @entity14			2
@entity11 's online support is way ahead of his rivals ' , including @entity10 's the @entity17 is now the focus for campaigners , marketers and activists , each claiming a slice of the virtual pie			1
we look at the impact of social networking sites on contemporary politics and ask , is the @entity28 the new battleground ? sites like @entity3 , @entity30 and @entity14 give people a tool to interact online and extend their social lives beyond working hours			1
but what 's interesting campaign managers is that they 've been seized with such enthusiasm by increasingly hard - to - target teens and young adults -- even @entity6 's prince @entity40 is rumored to have a @entity14 account			1
this marks a crucial development in the @entity17 's history : far from being a place where geeks go to hang out with other geeks , the @entity17 is now as vital a part of the average college student 's world as @entity50			1
no longer a virtual refuge for lonely nerds , these sites are used daily by bright young things , keen to arrange the latest hot club / bar / gig to visit			1
and politicians have wised up to this			2
@entity58 set the ball rolling in 2004 , raising around $ 50 million in his presidential nomination campaign by using the @entity17 to garner large numbers of small - scale donations and pump up his coffers			1
@entity64 followed suit in his 2004 presidential campaign against @entity67 , famously narrowing the funding gap with his @entity70 rival			0
but this time round , candidates are plugging in and getting personal			1
@entity72 was the first potential @entity70 presidential candidate to launch a @entity14 profile ; democrat @entity74 was the first to set up shop in virtual world @entity76 ; and @entity10 launched her presidential campaign via her web site			1
all of the major candidates for the 2008 american presidential election have support on @entity14 and profiles on @entity3			1
right now , these sites are being harnessed most successfully by the @entity13 , and notably @entity11 's campaign			2
at the time of writing , his supporters include over 161,000 friends on @entity3 against @entity90 's 42,000 - odd and @entity74 's 28,000			1
( @entity70 @entity91 has 21,000 ; @entity72 trails him on 12,000			0
) @entity11 's biggest @entity14 supporters ' group , " @entity94 for @entity11 " had over 320,000 members ( as opposed to @entity10 's " @entity94 for @entity10 , " with 5,300 ) ; and a growing pool of photographs on @entity98 , the photo - hosting online community			2
what @entity11 's team seems to understand -- and others grasp with varying degrees of success -- is that it 's not just about broadcasting to a hard - to - reach demographic			2
in order to recruit voters online , candidates must appear to engage with potential supporters on a far more personal level , on their terms , in their environment			2
these sites tear down the traditional barriers between those in power -- be they celebrities or politicians -- and their fanbase or supporters , providing the semblance -- if not the reality -- of personal involvement and a forum for discussion			2
if a 22 - year - old male from @entity126 can be " friends " on @entity3 with @entity128 , goes the thinking , why not senator @entity11 ? but only time will tell if the winner of this online popularity contest can convert his virtual " friends " into concrete votes			1
away from the presidential campaigns , social networking sites also make it easy for activists to cross political boundaries			1
net users do n't have to buy into a suite of policies ; using the web , pressure groups can focus their efforts on single issues instead			0
news on the virtual street travels quickly across existing networks of friends -- whether it 's via email , blogs or messageboards			2
in 2006 , @entity3 users spread the word about immigration rights demonstrations across the @entity157			0
the @entity158 reported that half a million people turned out to the @entity161 rally , while a @entity163 poll indicated that two out of three @entity157 heard about the protests			0
of course , the large numbers who attended the protests did n't all read about it on @entity3			0
but the site did enable grassroots information sharing between large numbers of people who were otherwise hard to reach , keeping them informed and encouraging them to action			0
it 's not just the social networking sites that are drawing campaigners ' attention			1
while flash mobs -- sudden , unexpected and short - lived gatherings of members of the public , organized by web sites and text messages -- usually tend towards the surreal ( zombie mobs in @entity190 , pillow fights in @entity192 ) they have also been utilized by pressure groups			1
a flash mob gathered at an @entity196 thrift store in @entity197 , @entity0 in 2003 , sang " give it away " by the @entity198 , stripped off and donated their clothes to the charity , in what the organizers claimed was the world 's first altruistic mob , while in 2004 , protestors in @entity207 , @entity208 , criticized limits to freedom of speech by sealing their mouths with duct tape			0
@entity98 , the social photo hosting site , has also been utilized			0
nearly 4,000 members have added their support to the one campaign to make poverty history by posting their photo to the campaign 's pool of photos , while @entity221 publicize their campaigning by tagging their photos and encouraging others to do the same			0
also on @entity98 , " @entity230 " is a @entity226 - led pressure group of @entity228 devotees who want @entity230 to make more environmentally - friendly computers			0
they post photos of themselves with their @entity228 to a @entity98 photo pool			0
quite literally , it 's a way of giving faces to the people behind the campaigns			0
it 's not all plain sailing			0
the @entity17 has its own style of writing and its own social mores			1
a lack of experience at navigating the virtual realm can be painfully apparent			0
politicians need to be careful about how they engage with their internet audience			0
savvy net - heads have little time for stuffed - shirt proselytizing , whether it 's on @entity3 or @entity251 ; having a @entity14 profile does n't automatically make you cool			1
and engaging with people online can backfire : the @entity255 , who set up a web site where the public could create petitions , were sorely embarrassed when 1.8 million people called for planned pay - as - you - drive road charges to be scrapped			1
the unexpected weight of public opposition to the policy ensured a barrage of rather unwelcome media attention			0
online presences are also susceptible to virtual attack			2
back at @entity14 , the only group coming close to @entity11 's support is the " one million against @entity10 " with over 230,000 members			0
@entity74 ' second life headquarters were vandalized by opponents ; and a 1984 - style pro-obama video attacking @entity10 and urging @entity157 to " vote different " had garnered over three million views on @entity251 at the time of writing			2
both attacks were veiled by the anonymity which the @entity17 provides , and politicians must now be wondering how much dirtier online campaigns will get -- and to what extent they 'll escape from @entity284 ' control			1
and that 's where the real power in the @entity17 lies			1
far from being a one - way broadcast , the medium allows people to engage with each other , get involved and focus on the issues they care about most			0
most of all , it allows people to take a campaign and evolve it themselves			0
while this will terrify traditional campaign managers and @entity300 , who can see quality assurance flying out of the window along with their approved , on - message briefing sheets , is it really a bad thing that the @entity17 gives regular joes the chance to broadcast alongside the big guns -- and the potential to beat them at their own game ? ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... could online campaigning change the outcome of the 2008 us presidential election ? will the @entity17 encourage more people to get involved in political debate ? tell us in the forum -- or read others ' thoughts on the future			1

politicians harness @entity17 social networking sites to target youth
web - savvy candidates create their own online profiles
@entity17 helps activists cross political boundaries
but only time will tell if virtual friends will cast real votes
