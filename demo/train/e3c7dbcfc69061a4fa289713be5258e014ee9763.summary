@entity0 , @entity1 -- amid an ongoing congressional probe into the @entity5 , a @entity2 investigation has uncovered more evidence of wasteful spending at the agency , including cooking classes for employees that cost as much as $ 3,350 per class			1
for years , the @entity5 paid to send employees to these cooking classes to build team spirit , part of a spending pattern that the agency now says was inappropriate			1
employees based in @entity0 , @entity1 , attended classes at @entity20 of @entity0 , located in suburban @entity21 , where they cooked meals			2
senator encourage @entity5 to ' clean house ' the @entity5 confirmed that there were nine classes beginning in june 2007 , with the last class in june 2011			1
the total cost to the @entity5 was $ 20,701			1
" we should be thinking about our federal customers , our taxpayers and our associates , " said one employee who attended a cooking class			0
" and that seems to have been lost in these team - building exercises ... if you do n't go , you 're ostracized			0
'' the employee works in the @entity0 office and requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to @entity2 and feared reprisals from his supervisors			2
" these events indicate a pattern of misjudgment , which spans several years and administrations , " @entity5 spokeswoman @entity44 told @entity2 in a statement			1
in the world of trillion - dollar government budgets , the classes do not amount to a significant sum of money			0
however , the unnamed employee and other insiders told @entity2 that this was part of the free - spending culture that went on for years at the @entity5 's @entity0 regional headquarters			1
congressional committees are examining @entity5 spending after a scathing inspector general 's report issued earlier this year showed lavish spending -- $ 823,000 -- at the @entity65 , which took place in @entity67 in october 2010			1
@entity68 , the @entity5 official who organized the conference , resigned , as well the agency 's administrator , @entity70			1
two of @entity70 's deputies were fired and eight other employees left the agency			0
@entity76 , a former @entity77 official , took over as acting @entity5 administrator			2
the @entity5 , which has more than 12,600 employees and a $ 26.3 billion budget , is tasked with helping manage and support government agencies			1
in addition to the @entity67 conference , the @entity5 apparently spent $ 330,000 to relocate an employee from @entity85 to @entity86 -- and likely millions more dollars on other employees over a two year period -- according to a transcript of an interview with a @entity5 event planner			1
and 84 @entity5 employees , most of them supervisors or other senior staff -- all subjects of inspector general investigations -- are still collecting their bonuses , totaling more than $ 1 million in taxpayer money			1
@entity44 says all the agency 's practices are under a top - down review			0
" this must stop , and is why acting administrator @entity76 has instituted stringent new policies on conferences and events -- to put an end to this misuse of taxpayer dollars , " she said in the @entity5 statement			1
@entity111 , who owns @entity20 in @entity0 , said it appeared from her records that the @entity5 also had two classes in 2004 , but the agency could not find records of those events			1
she referred @entity2 to the @entity5 regarding the costs of the classes			1
during the classes , participants prepare meals as team - building exercises			0
but under the new @entity5 policy , any future team - building events could only be held in a federal facility			2
" only light refreshments , like water and pretzels , would be allowed , " the @entity5 statement said			1
a @entity5 spokesperson on thursday clarified the agency 's policy , saying that no food will be permitted at any team building exercises			1
@entity5 records show classes from june 2007 to june 2011 , with the cost ranging from $ 1,162 to $ 3,350 per class , depending on the number of employees who attended			1

the culinary center 's " menu of classes " states that its " state - of - the - art kitchens create a unique atmosphere where your group can work together to build trust , develop plans of action , work toward a common goal , make it happen and celebrate their accomplishments			0
" the @entity5 turned down repeated requests by @entity2 for an on - camera interview with @entity76 or @entity159 , the regional administrator for the @entity161 region			1
however , @entity76 agreed to an interview on wednesday , hours before this story was schedule to air on @entity2 's @entity165			2
" i think the most important thing is we need to make -- we need to get a message across that this is n't what @entity5 is about			2
people are n't coming to work for cooking classes , " @entity76 said			1
" they are n't coming to work for awards or prizes			0
they are coming to work for an important mission that 's critical to serving our agencies that serve the @entity178 people			0
and so that 's the trick for us is to really build a better sense of expectation of what it is that we 're going to do every day when we do our jobs			0
" he said employees " really believe and value the service of providing excellent ... high value public buildings and low cost acquisition services , so i think that they 're really committed to what they 're doing and we just need to give them the right leadership , give them the right systems , and give them the right tools			0
also , the right level of accountability			0
" who 's on first ? hearing shows @entity5 's dysfunction @entity159 agreed to an interview after @entity2 showed up at a public event he was hosting at the @entity0 headquarters			1
he said he had not heard about the cooking classes until @entity2 began asking about them			1
" and i was unaware of those until , actually , you brought them to my attention , and that unfortunately has been the recent organizational structure			0
and that 's part of what we 're seeing in the change in @entity5			2
" asked about this kind of spending , @entity159 said , " i think it was the old culture at @entity5 , and you saw it in all the news that was generated out of the @entity65			2
" during the interview , @entity159 said he did not have the authority to stop activities such as cooking classes			1
however , @entity44 pointed to an april 15 memo that suspended spending for training conferences , leadership events , award ceremonies and team - building			0
as part of the new @entity5 structure , these types of events would have to be approved by headquarters and the regional administrator			2
" under the new @entity5 leadership , regional administrators have the authority to stop cooking classes from taking place			1
on top of that , there is also a second layer of oversight in place , at central office , that would prevent this type of wasteful spending , " @entity44 said in the statement			1
the cooking classes were n't the only example of questionable spending in @entity5 's @entity256 region			1
@entity2 obtained records that showed the agency spent $ 2,938 on an awards luncheon on november 16 , 2011 in the @entity0 headquarters for 178 employees , and hired an etiquette speaker for a @entity264 event in march 2010 in @entity265 that cost the agency $ 993			1
@entity267 , a consultant , speaker and coach , confirmed that her luncheon speech focused on etiquette training			0
" we walk through the place settings and the different courses ... how to eat soup and salad , what to do with your napkin , how to butter your roll , " she said			0
" passing the salt and pepper -- there is a long litany of what is good dining etiquette			0
you look much more professional when someone knows the rules of dining			0
" she said she compares " the rules of dining to motor vehicle rules			0
without safety , we 'd be running amok			0
there 's a proper way to go about it			0
" video offers glimpse inside @entity5 's lavish @entity67 conference the @entity5 employee compared the agency to a high school pep club			1
" and if you had a pep club that had government funding , imagine what you could do			0
you could make the best floats , you could have the best decorations			0
and so there is a lot of what i would look at as juvenile behavior when it comes to caring about what the taxpayers ' money is used for , " the employee told @entity2			2
last november , the @entity5 in @entity0 launched " the first annual @entity315 " in which employees produced videos to highlight the agency 's efficiency			2
the videos , all shot and produced on government time , show employees in various skits and holiday outfits			0
the winner received an ice cream social			0
after news accounts of the @entity67 scandal , the videos , which were accessible online to employees , were taken down , the @entity5 confirmed			2
@entity159 told @entity2 he was one of the judges for the video contest			2
" so some of the things i was aware of -- in fact , in the holiday videos , i was one of the judges , " @entity159 said			0
" again , that was part of the culture that was pretty common throughout @entity5 , and something that is changing , and i think you see a new day at @entity5			2
