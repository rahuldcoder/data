@entity0 -- a government report released thursday paints an alarming picture of an unstable future for international relations defined by waning @entity7 influence , a fragmentation of political power and intensifying struggles for increasingly scarce natural resources			1
the report aims to better inform policymakers , starting with the administration of president - elect @entity15			2
the report , " @entity17 : a transformed world , " was drafted by the @entity18 to better inform @entity7 policymakers -- starting with the incoming administration of president - elect @entity15 -- about the factors most likely to shape major international trends and conflicts through the year 2025			2
" although the @entity7 is likely to remain the single most powerful actor , the @entity7 ' relative strength -- even in the military realm -- will decline and @entity7 leverage will become more constrained , " says the report , which is the fourth in a series from the @entity18			0
the report argues that the " international system -- as constructed following the second @entity31 -- will be almost unrecognizable by 2025 owing to the rise of emerging powers , a globalizing economy , an historic transfer of relative wealth and economic power from @entity38 to @entity39 , and the growing influence of nonstate actors			1
" it argues that the world is in the midst of an unprecedented " transfer of global wealth and power " -- from @entity38 to @entity39 -- that is being fueled by long - term " increases in oil and commodity prices " along with a gradual shift of manufacturing and certain service industries to @entity54			1
and yet , while @entity7 power and influence are projected to decline , @entity7 's burdens are not			0
" despite the recent rise in @entity60 , the @entity7 probably will continue to be seen as a much - needed regional balancer in the @entity39 and @entity54 , " the report notes			0
the @entity7 military will continue to be expected to play a leading role in the war against global terrorism , though the @entity7 as a whole will be less able to " call the shots without the support of strong partnerships			0
" @entity7 's biggest rival by 2025 , the reports says , will be @entity72			1
" @entity72 is poised to have more impact on the world over the next 20 years than any other country , " it notes			1
the report projects that @entity72 will have the world 's second largest economy by 2025 and will be a leading military power			1
equally problematic for @entity7 policymakers is the fact that @entity72 is expected to become the world 's biggest polluter and largest importer of natural resources			1
@entity72 will not be alone , however , in terms of its desire to provide a consumption - oriented @entity7 lifestyle to a rapidly growing population			1
countries such as @entity92 and , to a lesser extent , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 , will also likely see their power -- and desire for natural resources -- increase			1
the report predicts that , the recent economic downturn aside , " unprecedented global economic growth " will mean that the demand for basic resources such as food , water and oil " will outstrip easily available supplies " over the next decade			1
as an estimated 1.2 billion people are added to the world population over the next 20 years , the demand for food will rise by 50 percent , the report projects			2
the lack of access to stable water supplies will also worsen due to rapid global urbanization , it says			0
further complicating matters is the fact that while demand for energy is projected to rise , oil and gas production will continue to be " concentrated in unstable areas , " it says			2
the world in 2025 is therefore likely to find itself in the midst of a " fundamental energy transition away from oil toward natural gas , coal and other alternatives			1
" such a transformation , however , may not stave off armed conflict driven largely by the struggle for scarce resources , the report says			2
while conflicts are still most likely to " revolve around trade , investments , and technological innovation and acquisition , " the report states that " we can not rule out a 19th century - like scenario of arms races , territorial expansion , and military rivalries			0
" terrorism is also expected to remain a major issue through 2025 , though its appeal could be significantly reduced if economic and political liberalization accelerates in the @entity39			0
" in the absence of employment opportunities and legal means for political expression , conditions will be ripe for disaffection , growing radicalism and possible recruitment of youths into terrorist groups , " the report argues			1
adding to complications in the always - volatile @entity39 will be @entity95 's possible acquisition of nuclear weapons , which could trigger a regional nuclear arms race , the report says			2
continuing tensions between @entity92 and @entity167 also add to concerns regarding nuclear proliferation , it says			0
the report highlights the need for new technological innovation to provide " viable alternatives to fossil fuels " and overcome future food and water constraints			0
at the moment , " all current technologies are inadequate for replacing " traditional energy sources " on the scale needed , " it says			0
the bottom line , the report says , is that " the next 20 years of transition to a new system are fraught with risks			0
" " this is a story , " it says , " with no clear outcome			0

report says @entity72 will have growing impact , second largest economy by 2025
there will be an unprecedented global transfer of power because of oil , report says
@entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , will likely see power , desire for natural resources increase
" unprecedented " growth means demand for basic resources will *outweigh* supply
