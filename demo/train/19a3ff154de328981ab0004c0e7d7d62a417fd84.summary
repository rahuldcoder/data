-- the double veto cast by @entity2 and @entity3 at the @entity5 @entity4 on saturday represents a clarifying moment in the @entity8 uprisings			1
at the 2012 @entity12 , @entity11 secretary of state @entity9 noted , " we do n't know what the endgame will be until we start the game			0
" well , fasten your seatbelt -- the game over @entity8 has started			2
the @entity8 conflict is no longer just about a brutal dictator repressing peaceful protesters who are demanding what every @entity23 desires : dignity , freedom , and an opportunity at a decent life			2
the @entity8 revolution is now the fault line in @entity32 politics , through which @entity11 - @entity2 competition , the @entity11 - @entity35 conflict , the @entity35 - @entity37 regional rivalry , and the @entity41 - @entity40 ages - old conflict will play out			1
the double veto has dealt a heavy blow to the political endgame outlined by the @entity47 proposal : an orderly transfer of power from the president to his deputy , formation of a unity transition cabinet to oversee the writing of a new constitution , and the holding of parliamentary and presidential elections			0
to start with , this endgame had a minimal chance of success			0
giving up power peacefully is not an @entity64 family tradition			0
both father , the late @entity64 , and son , @entity67 , have shown their willingness to use any violent means at their disposal to quell internal dissent			0
this was the case in @entity75 in 1982 when @entity64 sent his military , including warplanes , to crush an @entity79 uprising , killing an estimated 10,000 people and razing one - third of the city buildings			1
in @entity86 , @entity75 , @entity83 , @entity84 , and numerous other @entity8 cities , the son is now living up to his father 's murderous legacy			0
what the protesters and activists on the ground will take from the double veto is one lesson : down with politics -- this is a military fight , and it is ours to win			0
while the international community will be there in words , it lacks the will to intervene militarily in @entity8			2
as @entity104 said , " military intervention has been absolutely ruled out and we have made that clear from the very beginning			0
" the double veto at the @entity5 marks the beginning of the proxy regional game : armed opposition under the leadership of the @entity110 -- funded by @entity111 including @entity37 and @entity112 , trained by @entity113 -- waging a protracted fight against the pro-regime military and paramilitary groups funded and trained by @entity35 and @entity2			1
despite recent limited success in defending restive cities and taking control of territory in places like @entity122 and @entity86 , the @entity110 remains more a collection of disparate groups of defectors than it is an organized army			0
its headquarters are in a refugee camp inside @entity113 close to the @entity8 border			0
the number of fighters is estimated to be in the range of 10,000 to 30,000			0
to wage an effective military campaign against an army that numbers in the hundreds of thousands , they need weapons , training and operational support			0
only when the regime 's military superiority is threatened will we start to see defections in its senior ranks			0
@entity35 , the @entity8 regime 's main sponsor and ally , will not stand idle			1
there are reports by @entity8 opposition groups of @entity35 assistance to the @entity8 regime , especially in the area of building electronic and telecommunications capacity			1
@entity35 , @entity2 and @entity3 are the main suppliers of weapons to the @entity67 regime			1
while @entity35 's support in weapons and training will continue , and in fact increase , in the coming weeks , it would be hard to say whether @entity35 and / or its proxy @entity165 will send troops to assist in the @entity8 regime 's military campaign			1
it is fair to say that @entity35 and @entity165 will come to @entity67 's rescue in case of a @entity173 - like scenario			2
@entity35 's supreme leader warned of a regional war in case of a military intervention in @entity8			1
absent that , @entity35 and @entity165 will assess whether military action to prop up a regime whose political fortunes are rapidly declining will make a difference in preventing @entity67 's ouster , an outcome @entity11 president @entity179 describes as " inevitable			2
" despite all the rhetoric about a @entity11 - @entity189 conspiracy targeting the @entity8 regime , the @entity35 regime itself has been reaching out to @entity8 opposition groups			1
@entity193 's interest now lies in delaying the inevitable as long as possible while laying the groundwork for a working relationship with a post-al - @entity64 regime			1
given the makeup of the opposition groups and @entity35 's pro-al - @entity64 stance , it is unlikely that @entity35 will be able to preserve the close alliance it has built and nurtured with the @entity8 regime since the days of @entity64			1
the best @entity35 could achieve is that whoever replaces @entity67 will not be hostile to @entity35 or to @entity165 , @entity35 's main regional proxy			2
while it is hard to predict the final endgame in @entity8 , it is safe to argue that the failure at the @entity5 @entity4 to approve the @entity47 proposal for an orderly transfer of power in @entity8 sets the stage for a protracted bloody stalemate between a brutal regime and a militarized opposition			1

@entity221 : the vetoes of a @entity5 *resolution* by @entity2 , @entity3 bring clarity to @entity8 situation
she says the @entity8 opposition will conclude that it must achieve its goals militarily
the outlook is for a protracted battle with outside nations *exerting* influence
slim : @entity35 will support the @entity8 regime but *explore* possibilities for post-al - @entity64 era
