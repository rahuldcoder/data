-- @entity1 ' " @entity6 " is an ambitious , sweeping period drama that manages to be incredibly affecting and feel as if the words '' @entity4 '' are stamped across every frame			1
inspired by the true story of an @entity10 steward who worked under eight presidents ( @entity12 through @entity13 ) , the film stars @entity14 as @entity15 â € ” an unassuming man who witnesses history close - up at a time when a new chapter seems to be written daily			1
as proof of how radically the world will change during his lifetime , the story begins with @entity15 as a boy working on a cotton plantation , where his employer ( a fragile , haughty @entity30 ) teaches him how to serve white folks : '' the room should feel empty when you 're in it			1
'' years pass , and @entity15 lands a job at a ritzy @entity37 hotel , where his white - gloved obsequiousness grabs the attention of a @entity41 aide , who hires him			2
as the film skims @entity44 - style through turbulent decades and various inhabitants of the @entity46 ( a fun but distracting parade of famous faces , including @entity49 as @entity50 , @entity51 as @entity52 , and @entity53 and @entity54 as the @entity55 ) , @entity15 struggles with his messier home life			0
it 's the only place where his gift for orderliness fails him			2
his wife ( a beautifully nuanced @entity60 ) is an alcoholic , and his older son ( @entity61 ) is a rebellious civil rights activist			1
neither can draw this invisible man out of his shell			0
as @entity15 , @entity14 is mesmerizing			1
the actor seems to shrink into his imposing frame , summoning a performance of quiet , bottled - up force			0
there 's no question that @entity1 , the director of 2009 's " @entity71 , " deserves some of the credit for that			2
but as undeniably moving and powerful as his film is , it could have used more of that subtlety			0
the fact that he even comes close makes " @entity6 " worth seeing			1
