" that is how president @entity4 should begin one of the most significant speeches of his presidency : the commencement address at @entity9 this sunday			1
addressing the historically black all male institution gives @entity4 an opportunity to rectify his strategic neglect of african - americans			1
in this high - profile talk to his own demographic , the president has some explaining to do			2
@entity4 's identity as a black man is usually communicated subliminally , with the swag in his walk , the basketball court on the @entity22 , the sexy glances at the first lady , his overall cool			1
now , however , comes the time to be explicit : to speak out loud his affiliation , his fraternal pride and concern			2
that 's the good work that calling us " brothers " would do			1
in appearances before @entity36 audiences , the president sometimes sounds like he 's saying the wrong thing			1
he told the @entity38 to " stop grumbling , stop complaining , stop crying			2
" in a @entity40 talk at a black church in @entity42 , he criticized " too many fathers " for " acting like boys not men			0
" @entity36 - @entity36 men certainly could use an intervention from the most successful @entity36 - @entity36 man in history			0
they are on the bottom of many indicators of achievement			0
they suffer the highest level of incarceration , and the largest homicide rates , of any @entity57			1
in urban areas , fewer than half graduate from high school			0
their unemployment is among the highest in the country			0
" i 'm sorry i have n't done more			0
" the president has not spoken out forcefully against racial profiling and mass incarceration			1
he has not memorialized the mainly @entity36 victims of gun violence in @entity42 the way he has memorialized the mainly white victims of gun violence in @entity73 and @entity74			0
asked why he had n't done more to remedy the catastrophic rate of @entity36 unemployment , @entity4 said , " i ca n't pass laws that say i 'm just helping black folks			1
i 'm president of the entire @entity57			0
" " thank you for your support			1
" nobody understands , like this audience will , the contortions a successful @entity36 - @entity36 man has to make to fit in but stand out , to be strong but not intimidate or frighten , to be black enough but not too black			0
but in some ways the @entity36 - @entity36 community has been too understanding			0
@entity87 , while chairman of the @entity38 , said " the president knows we are going to act in deference to him in a way we would n't to someone white			0
" politically it was not the smartest thing to say ( the lgbt community did n't turn @entity4 into the most gay friendly president in @entity57 history by going easy on him ) but any black man could understand the sentiment			1
that 's why the @entity36 - @entity36 turnout for the president 's re-election was higher than the white turnout			1
now blacks who supported the president are doing exactly what other groups responsible for his victory are doing : waiting for him to return the favor			1
" we 've all got to do better			2
" the president is n't the only black man who needs to step up support of his brothers			2
my friend runs a mentoring organization for black boys in @entity120 , @entity121 , the nation 's most affluent black community			2
there is a long waiting list of boys , mostly without dads in the home , and only about 10 active @entity36 male mentors			0
president @entity4 provides , for @entity9 men and everyone else , a 21st century model of @entity36 masculinity			1
his oft stated support for women 's rights is a crucial component			1
the casual misogyny of some black popular culture , especially hip - hop music and videos , is a disgrace			0
it 's ok for the president to note that not every aspect of black male culture is praiseworthy			2
" the government 's primary intervention for black men is to lock them up			2
president @entity4 can not , on his own , reverse this course , but he can do much more than he has to disrupt the flow of the one in three young black men who are headed to prison			1
one example would be to speak in favor of decriminalizing marijuana , as have other politicians like @entity161 gov. @entity160			0
black men are selectively arrested for marijuana crimes , and these arrests have a stigmatizing effect on future employment and earnings that redounds to the detriment of @entity36 families			0
@entity4 was once a young black man who smoked pot , and it would be surprising if he actually believes that it 's fair for other young black men to be selectively prosecuted for that			1
" i am the most powerful man in the world , and i 've got your back			2
" those are words profound enough to make a black man cry			0
i believe them to be true , but hearing them proclaimed out loud would be incredibly meaningful			0
@entity36 - @entity36 men feel a special kinship with this president			0
how inspiring it would be for the president to acknowledge this connection , in his words and in his actions			0
what a difference it might make for the millions of black boys who now are headed to destinies very different from graduating from @entity9 or becoming president of the @entity57			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198 .			1

@entity198 : at @entity9 commencement speech , @entity4 must show grads he 's a brother
he says blacks have supported him even as they 've felt neglect as he 's balanced his role
he says @entity4 should thank grads for support , provide role model of 21st century masculinity
@entity212 : @entity4 must show he 's engaged on issue of *disproportionate* incarceration
