-- he was dubbed the " man without a country " who found he was at home running in one of athletics ' toughest events			1
@entity10 's story makes most sporting tales of triumph over adversity look like a walk in the park			1
robbed of a childhood , exiled from his parents and then his country , the marathon runner was pushed to the emotional limits during his upbringing in war - ravaged @entity23			1
" i was born in a war -- a civil war , " @entity25 told @entity0 's human to @entity27			1
" so there 's no such thing as childhood			0
" i do n't really like to talk about it ... but simply , my family sent me to go and live with my uncle in northern @entity23			1
it took me three years to get to him			0
" the 30 - year - old can be forgiven for not wanting to dwell on some of the horrors that @entity23 's second civil war inflicted			1
an estimated two million lives were lost between 1983 and 2005 , with 28 of his family including eight of his 10 siblings , perishing during the conflict			0
it was against this bloody backdrop that a nine - year - old @entity25 set off on foot on a marathon journey north in search of safety in 1993			1
journey into the unknown he was one of @entity23 's " @entity56 " -- an itinerant band of around 20,000 youngsters , mostly male , who were displaced during the war			1
they sought refuge in cities in the north or in refugee camps in neighboring countries , but many became entangled in the conflict			2
@entity25 was no exception , being made to work for a dollar a day by @entity23 soldiers as well as enduring kidnap by herdsmen			1
" they were not going to let us go back ... they might go and kill us or do whatever they want with us , " he recalled of his capture and subsequent escape alongside another boy			0
" when the sun came up , we started running			2
and we walk , we ran , we walk , we ran			2
" after finally being united with his uncle , the pair sought safety across the border in @entity87 before both were granted asylum by the @entity90 in 2001			1
they settled in @entity92 , @entity93 where @entity25 was encouraged by his new gym teacher to take up running , though initially he was reluctant			2
" i told him : ' you know what ? running is not my thing			2
i 'm not going to run because i already ran in @entity100 so i ran for my life ... so unless someone is chasing me , that 's when i would take running			1
" otherwise , no way ' and he was kind of ' no , you can , you can			0
you look like you could be a good runner			0
' " two months later , he was on the school team			0
" in my junior year in high school i won ... and in my senior year in high school i won the national indoor ( two - mile title )			0
that pretty much opened the door to college			0
" that performance and others outdoors earned him a scholarship to @entity120 where he cemented his status as a promising young athlete			2
marathon man while @entity25 began making great strides in the @entity90 back in his homeland things were also looking up			1
a peace agreement signed between north and south @entity23 in january 2005 would eventually lead to full independence for @entity23 six years later			1
the date , july 9 2011 , is etched into @entity10 's memory -- he had recently graduated from @entity130 with a degree in chemistry and was setting off for a new life in @entity134 , @entity135			1
" i put my @entity23 flag on the front of my car and pretty much drove 22 hours from @entity139 , @entity130 to @entity134 celebrating			1
" the move west also signaled a change in direction for his fledgling athletic career as he made the switch from track to tarmac			0
" there were no ( short - distance ) races available			2
the only opportunity was a marathon			2
i got into the @entity151 ( in @entity152 )			0
" he was a natural , coming home in two hours 14 minutes 32 seconds -- a time that comfortably met the qualification standard for @entity156 the following year			0
but there was a problem			0
he had no country to run for -- @entity23 was not a member of @entity161 ( @entity161 ) and he had yet to be granted @entity90 citizenship			1
at the last minute , the @entity161 granted @entity10 permission to compete as an independent athlete -- a first in @entity166 history			1
there was n't a @entity168 ending to this real - life fairytale -- he finished down in 47th place -- but as he ran around the streets of @entity172 in his black and grey @entity173 ( @entity173 ) kit he transmitted a powerful message to millions of disenfranchised people around the world			2
" it was very important for all the refugees around the world , and others who are ( feeling ) hopeless about the future to ( say ) ' i was just like you before but here i am now with the help of people , ' " he said			0
" ' and with you working hard , you are going to achieve whatever you want to achieve			0
' " return to homeland the following summer was even more momentous for @entity25 as he returned to @entity23 to visit his parents for the first time in two decades			1
" it was just overwhelming			0
i was very fortunate to be able to see them again			0
i was praying hard to find them alive , " he said of the trip organized by the @entity194 in june 2013			0
the reunion proved equally emotional for his parents			2
his mother collapsed at his feet in tears while his father jigged around singing songs before telling everyone his son 's running talent was down to him -- he claims to have chased and killed giraffes in his youth			1
@entity10 had previously used his uncle 's surname ( @entity209 ) when he moved to the @entity90 but reverted to his father 's name ( @entity212 ) when he was sworn in as a @entity90 citizen			1
and it 's his country of birth that remains at the forefront of his thoughts now			0
" i want to do something for the community and the @entity23 people , especially for the youth			1
it 's my goal to make sure they make the 2015 @entity225 and 2016 @entity156 if possible , " said the 30 - year - old athlete			2
" i hope to continue what i 'm doing right now , to be able to show the @entity23 youth and the country that there 's a way			1
" instead of being in a war , there 's a way we can unite			0
we can be together , we can be happy by doing something that 's positive			0
