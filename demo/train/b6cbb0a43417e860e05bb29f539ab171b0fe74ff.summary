@entity0 -- you 'd think that @entity3 showing up three hours late to her own book release party was the ultimate snub			1
but do n't judge this tell - all by its cover			0
@entity3 had spent the last four hours signing autographs at a local @entity11 store , and insisted on talking with every person in line and posing for snapshots			1
an entrepreneur , @entity3 wears many ( presumably stylish ) hats			1
she and her husband , actor @entity17 -- along with the couple 's children @entity20 , 3 , and @entity21 , 2 -- star in their own reality tv show , " @entity24 : @entity25			1
" @entity3 also has her own jewelry line , designs children 's clothing , and is a working actress , spokeswoman and author			1
" the great thing about what i do is i only take on work and businesses that are organic to me and i 'm passionate about			0
it 's kind of a blend of my life because at some point , my life became my business , and my business is my life ... which is a hard balance to strike , " @entity3 said			1
in her latest book , " uncharted @entity52 , " spelling tackles eating disorder rumors ( she says she had @entity55 ) , the truth about her marriage , her friendships ( or lack thereof ) with her former " @entity45 , 90210 " co-stars , motherhood and the thawing of her icy relationship with her own mother			1
spelling was eager to set the record straight about all talk of anorexia			2
" i address all of my health issues in the book , " she told @entity1			2
" and i think it 's really irresponsible to label someone with an eating disorder			1
i pride myself on being an inspiration to women out there , and i want them to have a healthy body image			0
i have a daughter of my own , so i think they should really do research and get their facts straight			0
" regarding her marriage , @entity3 says , " @entity17 and i have n't hid the fact that we 've had a rough year			1
" she attributes what she refers to as the couple 's " four - year crossroads " to a communications breakdown , differing opinions on parenting and @entity17 's opposition to her own self - proclaimed " workaholic tendencies			0
" in her book , @entity3 said she had come to terms with the fact that , like all couples , she and @entity17 were in an " ebb " phase , and that things were n't always going to " flow			1
" she wrote : " if someone says they 're in a perfect relationship -- they 're lying			0
and i was the girl who went into it wanting the perfect relationship			0
" although the internet is rampant with stories about @entity3 receiving the silent treatment from the old " 90210 " gang , she was asked about the possibility of her character , @entity108 , returning to the small screen on the new " 90210			2
" " you know what , " @entity3 told @entity1			2
" i totally would , but they have n't called me			0
for the fans , i would			0
" spelling , famous among her friends for throwing elaborate parties , is currently shooting a new reality show with the @entity118			1
" we 're currently filming ' @entity24 : weddings , ' " she says , " which is really amazing because everyone knows i love planning a party , and i specifically love planning a wedding and i 'm all about love			2
@entity17 and i have been working on our relationship this year and kind of getting back to us			0
and really , what 's better than love and a party ? so there you have the perfect wedding			0
and we have this great , unbelievable opportunity to plan people 's dream weddings and kind of navigate young couples through the process of getting married -- what their relationship is now and what they can look forward to and guide them through that			0
" when asked about the return of " @entity24 : @entity25 , " which just wrapped up its fourth season , @entity3 told @entity1 , " no official pickup has been announced , but if the fans bring us back , i think there 's a very good chance			1
the fans are worried that this is a replacement , but we plan on doing both shows , so the great thing about that is they 'll get two sets of ' @entity24 ' two times a year instead of one set one time a year			2
" spelling 's next writing project is a children 's book , due in september			1
" i am really excited about that , " she told @entity1			0

i 'm working with my same publishers , @entity165 , and when they told me they wanted to do a children 's book , and i was like , ' yes ! i am so in ! ' so i dedicated this book to @entity20 and @entity21 -- it 's called ' presenting ... @entity170 , ' and it 's about a little girl standing up for who she is and believing in herself			1
" spelling also shared an anecdote about @entity21 : " her new thing is she sings ' @entity175 ' and she dances to it			0
no joke , she shakes her hips ! " @entity3 says the little girl did n't learn it from her			2
" she watched ' @entity180 : the @entity181 '			0
they do it in that ! "			0
