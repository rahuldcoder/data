beside the van , his 2 - year - old brother lay dead , his throat also slashed			2
" she cut me , " the boy said in a high - pitched voice in an audio recording that was played thursday in @entity10 's first - degree murder trial			1
@entity10 , of @entity27 , @entity2 , has pleaded not guilty to charges of first - degree murder , attempted murder and child endangerment causing serious injury			1
before the trial , her lawyers filed a notice of intent to present an insanity defense , according to court records			1

the boy had locked himself in the van overnight after his mother slashed him and his younger brother the previous day and left them for dead , assistant @entity2 attorney general @entity48 said in his opening statement			1
@entity10 then walked to a nearby pond and attempted to kill herself by slashing her throat with the same weapon , a camouflage - handle @entity59 hunting knife she bought the month before , @entity48 said			1
when it became apparent she was not going to die , the prosecutor said , she staggered half a mile down the road to the nearest home and told a story she 'd concocted weeks before of how a stranger abducted the family , killed her sons and tried to kill her			1
but when authorities went searching for the stranger , they instead found her 7 - year - old son in the car and his younger brother dead outside the driver 's side			1
" do you know where you 're injured at ? " deputy @entity77 asked the boy in the recording			0

@entity10 began plotting the attack the month before with the purchase of the knife and the duct tape , @entity48 said			2

@entity10 tried to fight him off with pepper spray but he knocked her unconscious , the note said , according to the prosecutor			2
police said @entity10 later told them she had written the note in the midst of the attack to explain what had happened to those who would find the scene , according to the prosecutor			2
" and the note , which you 'll see , ends with , ' oh no , here he comes again ... ' " @entity48 told the jury			0
@entity10 faces life in prison without parole if convicted of first - degree murder for her son 's death .			0
