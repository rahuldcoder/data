@entity8 , who died of natural causes at age 93 on sunday , also did not want his stepson @entity11 to attend his funeral , attorney @entity7 said			2
@entity8 's wishes are the basis for a looming court fight over who controls the legendary actor 's remains and makes funeral and burial decisions , @entity7 said			1
while @entity8 disinherited his children , his wife and all but one of her children in a will he signed just weeks before his death , court papers suggest there is not much in his estate to fight over			1

@entity7 said @entity8 told him shortly before his death that he no longer wanted to be buried in the plot he purchased 15 years earlier			2
" substantial intervening events " in the years since changed his wishes , but @entity8 's lack of cash prevented him from purchasing a new burial plot , he said			1
@entity8 expressed a desire to be interred at either a veteran 's cemetery or a @entity78 cemetery with other stars			2
@entity80 , the final resting place for @entity82 , @entity83 and a long list of long gone show biz a-listers , is one possibility , @entity7 said			0
@entity7 said he doubts a deal can be made before the judge imposes a decision , since he is demanding that @entity11 be banned from the funeral because of @entity4 's severe dislike for the stepson who previously managed him			1
@entity8 won a $ 2.8 million judgment against @entity11 in a lawsuit that included accusations of elder abuse			0
@entity11 has yet to pay the judgment , @entity7 said			0
