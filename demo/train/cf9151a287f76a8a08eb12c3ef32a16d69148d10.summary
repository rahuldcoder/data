-- on friday , @entity2 chief @entity1 apparently fired @entity4 creative director @entity3 during a conference call with some 1,000 employees listening			1
the ceo was explaining changes at @entity9 that would reduce the number of sites in its local news network from 900 to 600			1
during the call , according to a number of sources , @entity1 told @entity3 to put his camera down and then , in the same breath , told him he was fired			1
then @entity1 resumed his conference call			1
it 's hard to know from the audio of his remarks -- which rocketed around online after the incident , drawing mainly derision and shock -- the complete circumstances of the exchange			1
on the face of it , though , it did n't sound so good			2
was it good leadership ? one of the top capabilities for adults in leadership roles is the ability to manage emotions even under the most trying circumstances			1
this self - awareness and self - management is part of being emotionally intelligent			2
leaders ' behavior has tremendous impact on others			1
not only does it affect morale and productivity , it also provides the behavioral model for others who look up to the person in power			2
ceos more than most have to manage the elegant balance of communicating tough messages in a straightforward manner but with a respectful style			2
they are representing themselves and the culture of their organizations to the world			0
there was a better way for @entity1 to have expressed his frustration at @entity3			0
@entity1 was conducting a conference call to a huge number of employees , and he was trying to deliver a tough message to them			1
no doubt @entity3 's taking photos of him during this call irritated and might have distracted @entity1 from his focused message			2
as humans , we all get stressed , have rough days and get triggered emotionally by the behavior of others			0
in fact , those of us with the highest standards of performance tend to have the strongest reactions			0
but that does n't give license for us to react impulsively			0
would we say to a colleague who is talking nonsense : " you are stupid ? " likely not			0
if we needed to convey dissatisfaction with an employee 's conduct , we do it privately so as not to humiliate the colleague and make ourselves appear heartless to others			1
at the same time , @entity1 had the right to feel annoyed			0
he was trying to give a difficult talk			0
what should he have done ? remembering his role as a leader , he should have sternly told @entity3 his behavior was distracting and that if he did n't stop , there would be consequences			0
if @entity3 became insubordinate , @entity1 should not have lost his temper but should have made a decision to deal with the behavior at a later time			0
and that 's after he did his due diligence with his human resources department			0
and he would advise @entity3 that a confrontation was not productive while he was conducting a conference call , but that there would be discussions in private			1
the outcome might have been the same but would have seemed to follow from reasonable judgment and not a knee - jerk emotional reaction			0
i do n't know the ceo in question and his relationship with the employee			1
there may be much more going on than we know at this point			0
but given @entity1 's leadership role , i would coach him to be accountable for what may have appeared to the listeners to be impulsive behavior and to do some damage control			1
most people are forgiving when they know their leaders are human			2
but they respect and are inspired by the leader who demonstrates humility , accountability and willingness to admit and learn from mistakes			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity141 .			0

@entity143 : @entity2 chief apparently *publicly* fired employee on conference call
she says leaders need to manage their emotions , even under trying circumstances
she says employee may have been annoying , but boss should have dealt with it privately
*writer* : ceo should do damage control : employees respect accountability , humility
