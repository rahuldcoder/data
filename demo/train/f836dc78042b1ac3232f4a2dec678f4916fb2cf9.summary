-- if i 'm pulled over by a police officer my first reaction is likely annoyance ; it is n't fear			1
that 's partly because i 'm a former city of @entity8 police officer and served as a reserve police officer in @entity10 , @entity11 , during my time on the faculty at the @entity15 's @entity14			1
i 'm also a former assistant chief counsel ( prosecutor ) with @entity16			2
many of my closest friends are in law enforcement			2
but , it is also , in large part , because i 'm a middle - aged white guy			2
the killing of @entity25 police officers @entity24 and @entity26 was a violent act of cowardice			1
did it somehow make " sense " to @entity30 , the accused shooter ? did he believe he was avenging the deaths of @entity35 and @entity36 ? maybe			2
but to assign this incident any significance in the larger picture is pointless			2
we do n't need to validate the terrible deed			2
what we need is to start an open and much needed discussion about relationships between the police and citizens in this country			1
" no justice , no peace , " is an often heard slogan at anti-police rallies			0
anyone who believes in justice and peace can not see @entity30 's alleged actions as anything but senseless murder that diverts us from finding solutions			1
what we need to do is find common ground			0
our experiences shape our perceptions , which form our personal reality			0
as such , common ground in this context can be difficult			0
we each only have one set of experiences			0
an " us against them " attitude permeates both the police and many communities			1
distrust is rampant on all sides			0
can i understand what it is like to be @entity78 in the context of interacting with the police ? no. but , if you have n't been a police officer you ca n't imagine what that job is like either			1
you frequently have to make split - second decisions			0
along with the adrenaline , fear is part of the job			0
you never know what 's going to happen to you			1
is this an excuse ? no. it is a call for better police training and more sensible ( and more limited ) laws to enforce in the first place			1
a great many " police failings " are more accurately described as political failings			1
nonviolent protest about situations involving law enforcement is productive			0
@entity30 has no place in that discussion ; his alleged actions should have no legacy other than our condemnation wherever we stand on the larger issues			1
the killing of two police officers in cold blood has no connection with the necessary review and scrutiny of law enforcement officers in specific incidents where transparency is crucial			1
the @entity118 states that the government derives its power from the " consent of the governed			0
" there is a deep chasm of trust , in many cases , between those who pass and enforce the laws and those who are subjected to them			0
this lack of trust has eroded the " consent " in many communities that often feel more occupied than served and protected by police			1
one @entity136 post believed to be from @entity30 read : " @entity137			0
" he went to " sleep " a coward after allegedly committing two heinous killings			0
any expression he intended was lost in the violence of what he did ; as it should be			0
moving forward , we have to figure out how to change the status quo			0
i believe that modern @entity78 police departments have overly embraced a " militaristic " ( for lack of a better term ) approach , in large part because of the endless war on drugs and the advent of the prison - industrial - complex where bed space is a commodity			2
an emphasis on , and promotional preference for ( usually based on seniority ) @entity165 - modeled units , specialized units and investigation functions has led , in many cases , to the most inexperienced officers being the most likely to interact with citizens during the more stressful shifts			1
i favor body cameras on police officers because they can serve a valuable purpose not only to the citizens , but also to officers who will be exonerated from baseless claims against them			1
far too many laws have led to far too many negative police - citizen interactions			2
@entity183 @entity182 precedent has created a framework where the subjective intent of the officer is irrelevant			0
law enforcement would be best served if it strictly adheres to the @entity188 , particularly the @entity189			0
at the end of the day , police should focus on : to serve and protect and secure -- as in , protect the @entity193 's right to be " secure " affirmatively instead of viewing it as a hindrance to their efforts as law enforcement professionals .			1

@entity25 police officers @entity24 and @entity26 were shot dead
@entity202 : the slaying of these police officers was cowardly , senseless
we need a bigger discussion about relationship between police and citizens
@entity202 : police should focus on how to serve , protect and secure *people* 's lives
