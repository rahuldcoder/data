-- @entity2 and @entity3 , lifetime residents of @entity5 , @entity6 , hold the third winning ticket worth $ 218 million in last month 's @entity9 lottery , officials announced wednesday			1
the retired couple came forward in their hometown 's @entity11 on wednesday after spending the past two weeks hiring " real good financial advisers " and a lawyer to help them manage their new fortune : $ 158 million after taxes			1
" instead of thinking of things we could spend it on , we 've been thinking of ways to invest it , " @entity18 , 65 , said wednesday			2
@entity3 , 62 , said that keeping their secret was easier because they 've been out of town most of the time since they won			1
" we were meeting with a lot of people , just not here in town , " she said the butlers are retired computer analysts			1
" i was retired , and it looks like i 've got another full - time job , " @entity18 said			1
he realized they won as he watched the 10 o'clock news march 30 , soon after the drawing			2
" the first thing i spotted was i had a mega ball number , " he said			2
at least he won something , he thought			2
" the further i went , the more they matched , " he said			2
but it took time for reality to sink in			2
" so , after i looked at it for a couple of minutes , i turned to my wife , who was right there with me , and i says , ' we won , ' " he said			1
" and she kind of looked at me funny , and i says , ' no , we won , ' and then she started giggling , and she giggled for about four hours , i think			2
" the butlers decided to keep it a secret			2
" i figured the quieter i keep it , the better we are to get it set up and get it going before we did the claim , " @entity18 said			0
it may have helped that it was april fools weekend when he was confronted at the local bank , where he went there to put the ticket in their lock box			1
" oh , i guess you come over to put your ticket away ? " someone at the bank asked them			1
" i says , ' yeah , i won this thing and got to get this thing out away			0
' i just laughed it off , and she does n't know until right now that i really had that ticket in there , " he said			1
guessing who held the ticket was the community obsession for the past 18 days in @entity5 , according to @entity81 , manager of the @entity83 convenience store where the winning ticket was sold			1
@entity81 and her staff members used the process of elimination to guess			0
" we 're watching to figure out who has n't been coming in , " she said tuesday			0
" if they got the ticket and are making themselves scarce , that 's what we 've been paying attention to			1
" mayor @entity96 suspected the decision by the winner to have the announcement in his southern @entity6 town was evidence it was a @entity5 resident			1
" not knowing who it is , it seems like they want to make a splash in @entity5 , " @entity96 said			1
some locals joked on @entity109 and the sidewalk that they had the winning ticket			1
but when @entity18 spoke , they did not realize he was not joking			0
" i answered most of the time truthfully , ' yes , i did , ' but they did n't catch it , " @entity18 said			0
@entity115 winner charged with welfare fraud @entity5 locals commenting on a message board thread threw out several names of suspected winners but never the @entity121			1
" names are just going around , we just need to wait and see when they come forward			2
congrats to whoever it was ! " one poster wrote			0
" i really do n't care who won			0
i really do n't want to know , it was n't me so i could care less ! ! ! " said another			0
" i just hope it is someone that needs the money , " another commenter said			0
@entity83 , which saw a two-fold rise in lottery ticket sales , also was gossip central for lottery rumors			1
one rumor floating there is that someone ordered 12 new camaros from the local @entity142 dealership , @entity81 said			0
" that 's a big rumor			0
i had a big laugh about that one			0
" the sales manager at @entity147 shot down that gossip			0
" they were corvettes , " said @entity149			0
" i 'm just messing with you , " @entity149 added , clarifying that he has no clue who the new millionaire might be and they 've not ordered new cars			0
the mayor said the " windfall of money " could be a boost for his farming community 's economy , but a person " can only buy so many groceries			0
" the @entity121 said they would remain in @entity5 , which @entity18 called " a nice comfortable , family - oriented community			1
" two other winning tickets were sold for the march 30 drawing that had a record $ 656 million pre-tax payout			0
@entity170 and @entity171 allowed their winners to remain unnamed , but @entity6 requires them to come forward			1
