a previous five - year collaboration led to total domination of @entity3 and @entity5 chief executive officer @entity4 is confident its new partnership with @entity7 can bring back that winning feeling to the team			1
since 1995 , @entity5 has been using @entity10 engines , but after two difficult seasons in @entity3 their new deal with the @entity13 car manufacturer renews one of the most successful partnerships in motorsport 's elite class			1
" the first few races i predict will be problematic , as we wrestle with what we hope are performance advantages , and inevitably performance advantages sometimes carry unreliability with them , " @entity4 told @entity1 's @entity19 in an exclusive interview			2
" once we 've got that in control , i think our competitiveness will be quickly established , and i feel when coupled to two world champions , and the talents of @entity31 and @entity32 , i think that the outcome i hope will be inevitable : that we 'll return to our winning ways , " he added			1
during those halcyon days of domination , @entity5 and @entity7 won 44 out of the 80 grand prix they raced as @entity38 and @entity39 secured a clean sweep of world titles between 1988 and 1991			0
it was the type of stranglehold @entity44 had over @entity3 last season when world champion @entity47 and teammate @entity48 at times appeared to be only racing against one another			2
last year , @entity44 won all but three of the calendar 's races , finishing with at least one car on the podium at every single race			0
while admitting to a " degree of guesstimate , " @entity4 believes @entity5 , which signed a multi-year global partnership with @entity1 at the start of 2015 , are not too far behind @entity44 , the team predicted to once again dominate the new season that gets underway with the @entity63 @entity62 on march 15			1
" it 's unlikely that anybody has surpassed the efforts of @entity10			0
and in sheer horsepower terms we do n't really fear the @entity10 engine , " added the @entity5 boss			1
for motorsport fans the 1988 @entity7 mp / 4 car is one of @entity75 's most historic pieces of machinery after it won all but one of the 16 races that season			2
speaking to @entity1 ahead of the launch of the team 's new car thursday , @entity4 conceded it was unlikely that the new incarnation of the partnership would be able to replicate that level of success , preferring to emphasize that @entity31 and @entity32 were key to @entity5 's hopes of success			1
" the tendency of the regulations at the moment is to put more control back to the driver , " said the @entity5 ceo as he compared @entity75 's pilots to " automotive musicians			2
" @entity4 added : " he has to be able to play with these devices and optimize the performance of the car , sometimes even during the lap. " so driver competence is going to play a very significant role in the future of grand prix racing until there 's another regulation change			0
" but managing two world champions is never easy â€” as @entity5 and @entity4 discovered when @entity31 left after just one season ( 2007 ) with the team due to tensions between the @entity112 and then rookie teammate @entity47			1
before @entity31 returned to @entity5 for a second spell , @entity4 conceded that " a great amount of time " was spent talking between the two of them about what had gone on before			1
" i have to say it 's more about the future than about the past			0
that as a topic was really about one third of the discussion and it was quickly dealt with			0
i mean we 're older people ... " while @entity31 's seat at @entity5 was sorted out " five or six races before the end of the season , " @entity32 was left to sweat over his @entity3 future			1
eventually he signed a new deal to extend his four - year stay with the team in december , with his services retained above @entity136 , who stayed on as a test and reserve driver			0
" these drivers had contracts through to the end of 2014 so there 's no contractual necessity and i was absolutely open to both drivers about what the process was , " said @entity4			2
" so i can understand the fuss but the fact is we 're a business			0
we 're a sport in a business , there 's a right time to take the decision , and the right time to take the decision was the time it was taken			0
if it had been appropriate to take it sooner we would have done			0
