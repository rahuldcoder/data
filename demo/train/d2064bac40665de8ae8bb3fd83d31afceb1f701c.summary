the @entity0 wants you to stop eating so much sugar			1
in draft guidelines proposed this week , @entity0 is encouraging people to consume less than 5 % of their total daily calories from sugars			1
the organization 's current guidelines , published in 2002 , recommend eating less than 10 % of your total daily calories from sugars			1
most @entity12 still consume much more			0
our sweet tooth increased 39 % between 1950 and 2000 , according to the @entity15			0
the average @entity12 now consumes about three pounds of sugar each week			0
" there is increasing concern that consumption of free sugars , particularly in the form of sugar - sweetened beverages , may result in ... an increase in total caloric intake , leading to an unhealthy diet , weight gain and increased risk of noncommunicable diseases , " who said in a statement			1
of particular concern , @entity0 said , is the role sugar plays in causing dental diseases worldwide			1
for an adult at a normal body mass index , or @entity36 , eating 5 % would be around 25 grams of sugar -- or six teaspoons			1
that 's less than is typically found in a single can of regular soda , which contains about 40 grams of sugar			2
real or fake sugar : does it matter ? to find the amount of calories from sugar in a product , multiply the grams by 4			1
for example , a product containing 15 grams of sugar has 60 calories from sugar per serving , according to the @entity54			1
if you eat 2,000 calories a day , that 's 3 %			2
@entity0 's proposed guidelines apply to sugars added to foods by manufacturers , as well as those found naturally in honey , syrups , fruit juices and fruit concentrates			1
they do not apply to those found in fresh produce			0
" much of the sugars consumed today are ' hidden ' in processed foods that are not usually seen as sweets , " the @entity0 website states			2
did you know sugar is often added to your frozen pizza ? how about your bread , soup , yogurt and mayonnaise ? as consumers became more concerned about the amount of fat in their food , manufacturers went out of their way to make low - fat items -- often substituting sugar to preserve the taste			0
choosing foods with fewer added sugars at the grocery story may soon get a little easier			0
the @entity94 has proposed several changes to the nutrition labels you see on packaged foods and beverages			0
the proposed labels would also note how much added sugar is in a product			0
right now , it 's hard to know what is naturally occurring sugar and what has been added by the manufacturer			0
the @entity0 guidelines will be open for public comment until march 31			2
then @entity0 will finalize and publish its recommendations .			0

the @entity0 proposes new guidelines for sugar consumption
who says we should eat less than 5 % of our total daily calories from sugars
