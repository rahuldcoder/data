@entity0 -- in @entity8 , a country where structure , conformity and security are bedrocks , it is often hard for individuals to break free and follow a more idealized path			1
it is especially difficult when that path turns out to be somewhat ... eccentric			2
so we salute @entity13 , who took the courageous step a few years ago of dressing up -- like a 15 - year - old schoolgirl			1
complete with ponytail , knee - high socks , penny loafers and a cute red kerchief , his outfit is the epitome of @entity8 girls ' school uniforms			1
his thinning white hair and beard , which frame his round , middle - aged man 's face , however , add something a little different to the look			2
by and large , he 's found that his unusual appearance , which he says makes him " feel comfortable , " is accepted on @entity0 's streets			2
now a patent - holding computer engineer , an accomplished photographer and presumptive music producer , @entity35 's life has n't always been this way			2
" when i was in university i majored in mathematics and i was very introverted , " he tells me as people crowd round to take photos -- he poses for up to 100 a day			0
" i never talked to people			0
i feel much more myself wearing this			0
" @entity8 ( ese ) society is all about conforming to the other people			1
( @entity8 people ) feel suffocated conforming to society			1
" for such a conservative country , the capital does have pockets of individuality , especially around the @entity56 area , where tourists often gather to snap pictures of some of the city 's more out - there residents			1
cosplay is a big thing in @entity8 , and many enthusiasts gather in the neighborhood 's @entity66 to show off their ensembles			1
but even here , the 51 - year - old stands out			0
certainly @entity13 's style is unique , and draws a lot of attention , even in @entity56			1
he tells me that it took him two hours to walk from @entity77 's famous crosswalk to the neighborhood , usually a 15 - minute stroll , because of all the people stopping to take photos with him			2
" comfortable , relaxed and happy " @entity82 , a tourist from @entity83 , encountered @entity13 in the @entity85 district , the beating heart of @entity8 's otaku ( geek ) culture and no stranger to societal outliers			1
she says that she was struck by his contentedness			0
" he just seemed so comfortable , relaxed , and happy ... i do n't know , embracing life			0
i think it 's great			0
" and his unique take on life -- and dress code -- has garnered some unlikely admirers			0
@entity100 , a private tutorial center in @entity0 , might be a far cry from the @entity8 public school system , which still largely operates by the old maxim , " the nail that sticks out gets hammered down , " but still , to draft in an elderly cross-dresser as a motivational speaker is a huge step for a @entity8 educational institution			2
the school 's staff learned of @entity13 's many talents , and @entity113 , an administrator at the school , said they were drawn to the " rich character behind the facade " as well as the potential this brave man had to teach their charges something about being themselves			1
" ( @entity124 ) just sends such a positive message , " @entity113 says			0
" it 's really useful to young people , particularly here in @entity8 -- this voyage of self discovery			1
" @entity13 calls it the key to a rich and happy life			2
" if @entity135 something you want to do , do that , " he says			0
' be yourself ' historically , cross-dressing has played an important part in @entity8 culture			2
@entity141 -- male kabuki performers who played the female role -- were , and remain , a staple of the art. a more modern flip - side to this can be found in the @entity147 , an all - female troupe which acts out campy musicals using an all - female cast in the town of @entity152 in @entity153 , as well a satellite theater in @entity0			0
variety shows on tv here also mine a rich seam of cross-dressing , and it 's common in anime ( @entity8 cartoons ) as well as @entity163 ( comic books )			1
but while men dressing as women is accepted in @entity8 pop culture , @entity13 says that real life reactions can be different -- he says sometimes people shout insults on the street , and notes that he 's been stopped by the police as many as ten times			1
despite the negative attention and discrimination , he thinks it 's worth it			1
it 's still outweighed by the positivity of the throngs of people eagerly posing with him as he skips from @entity77 to @entity56 , and by the kids he 's able to reach with his message of tolerance , and how liberating being a non-conformist can be			0
he says his story proves you donÂ¹t have to be conventional to be accepted			0
" thatÂ¹s my message , " he says			0
" @entity1 's @entity189 contributed to this report			0

@entity8 society is *generally* quite *traditional* and conservative
following an *alternative* *lifestyle* can be difficult , but @entity13 took the *plunge* a few years ago
dressed as a uniform - clad schoolgirl , he gets a lot of attention , both positive and negative
he 's been held up as an example of being true to yourself
