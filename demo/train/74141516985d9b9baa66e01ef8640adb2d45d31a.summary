@entity0 -- despite a five - year hiring surge , the @entity2 is at risk of not having enough senior air traffic controllers for its busiest and most critical facilities , where they are needed to run operations and train less - experienced controllers , according to the agency 's independent inspector general			1
nearly one - third of the senior controllers at the nation 's most critical facilities are eligible for retirement , according to a report by the @entity2 's office of inspector general			1
at a @entity23 - @entity22 @entity2 facility , 65 % of the controllers are eligible for retirement , it says			1
meanwhile , trainees are quitting jobs at high rates at those same demanding , high - volume facilities , according to the report			0
between fiscal year 2008 and fiscal year 2010 , critical facilities lost 40 % of their trainees to attrition , well above the national average of 24 % , the report says			0
the problems now are a legacy of the 1981 air traffic controller strike			1
that year , president @entity38 fired more than 11,000 controllers after they refused to return to work , and the @entity2 hired thousands of predominantly young controllers to replace them			1
in recent years , those controllers have become eligible for retirement , forcing the @entity2 to ramp up its hiring and training programs			1
the inspector general 's report looks at 21 facilities deemed " critical " to the nation because of the high volume of air traffic they control			2
the list includes several control towers at the nation 's busiest airports -- @entity57 , @entity58 and the @entity63 's @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 fields -- as well as several regional and high - altitude facilities			0
the @entity2 said monday it has " progressively improved " hiring , training and certification of new controllers and has increased its ranks of senior controllers , known as " certified professional controllers			2
" more than 5,000 certified professional controllers have been produced over the past five years as part of a hiring and training plan designed to ensure safe and efficient operations , " the agency said in a statement			0
" the @entity2 continues to meet overall goals for hiring , training time to certification and number of certified controllers			2
" the @entity2 told the inspector general 's office it recognizes the " failure rate " of new controllers is unacceptably high at some facilities and is addressing the issue			0
the office said that while the @entity2 is getting better at allocating staffing , " ot still has not provided the training support these complex facilities need to slow attrition and ensure the success of new hires			0
" it gave five recommendations , but said the @entity2 has satisfied three of them and is taking steps to address the other two .			0

the situation tracks back to the 1981 air traffic controller strike
then - president @entity38 fired more than 11,000 striking controllers
the @entity2 hired thousands of predominantly young controllers as replacements
those controllers have become eligible for retirement
