-- @entity1 is a part of some exclusive clubs : @entity4 and @entity5 champions			1
now he 's joined an even more exclusive group : players who have become owners of professional sports teams			1
last week , the @entity14 announced that a group including @entity1 , film producer @entity16 , baseball executive @entity17 and @entity19 ceo @entity18 had purchased the team			1
the staggering price tag : $ 2.15 billion			0
@entity1 told @entity32 's " @entity31 " that the new ownership was determined to turn around the ballclub , which has suffered from uneven play , an attendance decline and the @entity27 fan - beating scandal in recent years as well as controversy over previous owner @entity30 's financial situation			1
" we 're going to work hard to bring them a winning team and a great fan experience , " @entity1 told the @entity32 program			1
the 2012 baseball season officially opens wednesday , though two teams played games last week in @entity41			0
the owner 's box has traditionally been occupied by the likes of oil tycoons , real estate barons , old - money industrialists and high - tech millionaires			1
even in these times of athletes making eight - figure salaries , it 's rare for professional players to move from the playing field to the executive suite , observes @entity56 , a sports historian and professor at the @entity58 , @entity59			1
among those who have made the jump : @entity62 ( part owner of the @entity64 ) , @entity63 ( who has a major piece of the @entity68 @entity67 ) and @entity69 ( principal owner of baseball 's @entity70 )			1
there 's also historical precedent			2
@entity74 , a onetime journeyman catcher , owned baseball 's @entity75 for more than 50 years ; he was also the team 's manager and primary executive			1
@entity80 , who played a handful of games for baseball 's @entity83 , took a job with the @entity87 starch company of @entity88 , @entity89 , after his hardball career ended in 1919 ; a year later he took control of the company - sponsored football team , which became the @entity95 's @entity94			1
his family still owns the team today			2
no guarantee of success @entity1 may find out that big - league experience counts for little in his new profession			1
@entity74 had some good runs as @entity104 's owner -- particularly in the beginning -- but his teams suffered greatly after post-championship fire sales in 1915 and the early 1930s			1
in the last 20 years of his ownership , the team finished last 10 times			2
in those days , there were no multimillion - dollar television revenue streams to provide a rebuilding nest egg ; the team almost went bankrupt in the early ' 50s			0
but it 's not like all the 21st - century perks that teams get these days -- tv money , luxury suites , sponsorships -- have helped some players turn their athletic expertise into ownership triumph			1
the legendary hockey player @entity123 became a part owner of the @entity125 in 2001			1
even after @entity123 took over as head coach , the team struggled			1
it declared bankruptcy in 2009 , and @entity123 stepped down as coach and owner that fall			1
@entity62 bought the @entity5 's @entity64 in 2010			0
on sunday , with the team in the midst of a horrific season , @entity62 put out a statement that he was " 100 % committed to building the @entity64 into a contender " and has " no plans to sell the team			2
" @entity1 's already a proven businessman , having built @entity141 into a $ 500 million - plus operation with movie theaters and @entity145 franchises , according to @entity146			1
he said he 's committed to being the public face of the team and making the @entity14 the talk of @entity150 again			1
" i will have my office at @entity152			0
... i 'll be doing the community , getting out , selling the dodger brand , " he told " @entity31			1
" @entity156 , who 's a partner in seven minor league baseball teams , said he thinks @entity1 can provide exactly the magic the storied @entity14 need			1
" they could n't pick a better front guy , " @entity156 said			0
" i think this is a tremendous opportunity for both the fans and for him			0
i think baseball ( fans ) are clamoring for a face -- for somebody they feel who is on their side or one of them			0
" can @entity1 just use his magic ? @entity156 knows something about bringing fans to the ballpark , using a " fun is good " mantra for such promotions as groundskeepers dragging the field in drag , massage - giving nuns and " @entity181			2
" he 's the son of the late , legendary major league owner @entity182 , who gave @entity186 's old @entity185 its exploding scoreboard , hired 3 - foot - 7 - inch @entity187 for an at - bat and won pennants with the 1948 @entity190 and 1959 @entity186			2
the ' 48 @entity190 set an attendance record that was surpassed just twice in the next 30 years -- both times by the @entity14			0
@entity156 urges @entity1 to listen to the fans by hosting town hall meetings and making frequent appearances			2
" now we have a chance for a legitimate hero on several planes to say , ' let 's get in this together , ' " he said			0
" the most important thing is to involve them			0
" and once the @entity14 have re-established a customer - friendly reputation , then @entity1 can tap into the benefits of @entity206 , @entity156 suggested			2
" we 're celebrity - driven			0
at first blush i 'd name every night of the season after some ( star ) and almost dare them not to come ! " he laughed			0
there are never any guarantees in sports , of course			0
the @entity14 may have been overpriced , hurting future bottom lines			0
the ownership group dynamics may change			0
( when he bought the @entity83 , @entity217 said he 'd be a hands - off owner ; years later , one of his minority partners , @entity219 , offered the classic observation that " there is nothing quite so limited as being a limited partner of @entity217 's			2
" ) more directly , the crosstown @entity225 had a huge off - season , signing marquee player @entity227 , and have blanketed @entity150 with billboards			0
on the other hand , the @entity14 are coming off a third - place finish and are n't expected to make the playoffs this season			0
but , said @entity156 , do n't count @entity1 out			2
" his name is synonymous with fun and laughter , " he added			0
" i 'd love to have that gig , to promote fun and laughter with someone named @entity141			0

@entity1 becomes one of the rare team athletes to become a team owner
professional players have had a mixed record when they have turned to team ownership
@entity69 's @entity70 have done well , but @entity123 's @entity125 fell flat
@entity1 says he 's committed to improving team and " selling the dodger brand "
