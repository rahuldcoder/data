-- confusion , fear , frustration -- emotions are running high among @entity6 's people as they face the prospect of new elections next month and massive uncertainty over the country 's economic future			1
no party was able to form a coalition government after the vote earlier this month , and there is no guarantee that the elections set for june 17 will result in political stability either			1
@entity6 set election date amid fears meanwhile , the idea that @entity6 might leave the euro , the single currency used by 17 nations , is gaining traction despite the latest vows of support from @entity29 leaders , and the @entity6 people continue to suffer under painful austerity measures			1
@entity32 , a 20 - year - old medical student from @entity33 , told @entity0 that the current crisis is affecting every aspect of life , even people 's friendships			2
" i can honestly say that the fragile political situation in @entity6 has scared almost everyone i know , " he said			1
" people have been considering withdrawing their bank deposits , if they have n't done this already			0
most importantly , however , this recent political turmoil -- and the elections to follow -- has put a burden on everyone 's interactions and everyday life , " he said			1
" people in @entity6 are now divided			1
i keep arguing with my friends concerning our voting preferences			0
misinformation is rampant , and everyone is critical of everybody else			0
" @entity6 president @entity57 raised the specter of a run on banks tuesday after the central bank reported that @entity6 pulled about 800 million euros out of the banking system on monday			1
" there is , of course , no panic , but there is fear that could develop into panic , " @entity57 said , describing what the central bank governor told him			0
@entity72 newspaper @entity71 said its reporters had been out to banks in the past two days and seen no signs that a " rush " was on			2
journalist @entity76 , based in @entity33 , also rejected the idea that his fellow citizens are panicking , but he said many fear for the future			0
woman ' sacrificed for a future that never came ' part of the problem is confusion over whether @entity6 really risks being kicked out of the euro zone if it does not abide by stringent @entity29 bailout terms because every politician gives a different answer , he said			1
" we hear so many things and we do n't know where the truth lies , " @entity92 said			0
" now we wait for new elections and , for sure , people think that neither @entity100 nor @entity101 , the two major parties , can help the country			2
and we are sure that the measures that @entity29 asks us to take will not solve the problems for @entity6 ( either )			1
" those austerity measures include the tax increases and painful cuts to wages , services and pensions that have angered many voters and sent them flocking to back parties such as the leftist @entity114 coalition , rather than the more moderate pasok and @entity101			0
the ensuing political deadlock is leading to fears that @entity6 will not have a government in place when it needs to make critical debt payments , which could in turn jeopardize its place in the euro zone			1
business leaders prepare for ' @entity124 ' at the same time , its people ask how much hardship they can be expected to take			0
" here in @entity6 many people are really poor right now , " said @entity92 , pointing out that for many workers salaries have dropped by more than a third over the past year , but costs have not			1
" they do n't have the money to cover their basic needs , such as to buy food or pay for their utilities or their phones , and every day more and more ( people ) get in that situation			0
so if you do n't have money to buy food , you 're not worried about the @entity29 future of the country -- you are worried about your survival			1
" @entity6 media reports reflect the pain many people are feeling , as well as the sense that they are being unfairly asked to pay for a crisis not of their making			1
" the country will once again test its endurance limits , as going back to the polls is unavoidable , " the daily @entity153 newspaper said wednesday , as the date for a new election was announced			0
@entity159 , a daily left - leaning newspaper published in @entity33 , suggested the international community is trying to shock the @entity6 people into electing a government that will stick to the bailout deal despite the painful austerity measures attached			1
" the bailout forces and troika create hell for 30 days in order ' to correct ' the vote of the people , " are the opening words of one its main stories			0
turnout was much lower than usual in the may 6 election , said @entity177 , president of the @entity179 - based think tank @entity178 , likely reflecting people 's disillusionment with the system			0
he says his country is in urgent need of a stable , credible government to restore confidence and let investors know that @entity6 is " open for business			1
" @entity6 will consider themselves @entity29 whether they are in the euro zone or not , said @entity177 , a former visiting scholar at the @entity190 at @entity191			1
but most people do not want @entity6 to leave the euro zone , despite the huge debt it must carry to stay in the club			1
" the problem is , how will you repay that debt ? how will you emerge as a winner from that debt ? that 's not easy to do , " @entity177 said			0
he also warns that if @entity6 were to quit the euro and return to a national currency , such as the drachma , the move would result in years of turmoil and cost money the nation does not have			1
@entity177 wants to see more young people in politics , bringing fresh ideas and a more outward - looking perspective			0
reform of the country 's laws and electoral system is also needed , he said , if long - term stability is to be achieved			0
in the meantime , no one will listen to the interim prime minister sworn in wednesday , he warns , and @entity6 will continue to flounder until a government is convincingly elected that can win the trust of its own people and build alliances abroad			1
" we have no allies whatsoever , " he said			0
" we are not credible and nobody trusts us -- and that is unfortunate because some of us are trustworthy , and now we need to prove that			0
" @entity232 , whose job with an export firm means she often travels outside @entity6 , said she is frustrated by the unflattering views of her country she hears elsewhere			2
" we are not a nation of lazy people or thieves or crooks , " she said			0
" as in all the countries around the world , there are people who work hard ( for low wages ) , or people who beg for a job to feed their family , or people that fear about the unknown future			0
" the fault lies with the corrupt system presided over by @entity100 and @entity101 for decades , @entity232 said , not the ordinary people who are suffering as a result of politicians ' self - interest			0
" @entity6 did n't vote thinking of their @entity259 future , but it was a vote of anger against our political system , our politicians who behaved to us all these years like we are their ' clients , ' " she said			1
looking ahead to the elections on june 17 , the mother of two says @entity6 need to keep their country set on a @entity29 course			1
" i ca n't say that i am optimistic for what is going to happen , but i know that to the extent that i can , i will try to influence those of my friends who voted angrily the previous time now to give ( it ) a second thought , " she said			0
" i am a @entity29 ; i want to continue being in the @entity259			1
i want the euro currency , and i will vote now in new elections			2
" @entity32 , studying medicine at the @entity278 , says many people struggle to know what to make of @entity283 chancellor @entity282 's comments on @entity6 , or the speeches of their own politicians			2
but , he said , " two things are certain : nobody wants @entity6 to exit the euro , and everyone can see that the financial situation in @entity6 has deteriorated rapidly with no light at the end of the tunnel			1
" @entity32 said he has taken part in some of the many anti-austerity protests that have filled the capital 's streets in recent years			0
many people 's anger is fueled by the fact that the country 's huge debt is a result of government overspending and corruption rather than private debt , he said			0
meanwhile , those who do pay taxes , in a country where tax evasion is a big problem , have to shoulder even more of the burden			0
like many students of his generation , @entity32 anticipates that after graduation he will have to leave @entity6 -- where more than half of those under age 25 were unemployed as of january , according to @entity320 figures -- to seek work elsewhere			2
journalist @entity92 , 32 , said four of his friends have left @entity6 to find work in recent months			2
" if you asked me two years ago , i would never believe that so many young people would leave @entity6 and go to @entity326 or @entity283 or other @entity29 countries , " he said			1
" it 's very sad			0
" @entity32 believes that while the tough austerity measures imposed on his country may have kept the banks and lenders afloat , it has not help restore investor confidence in @entity6 , " instead plunging the country in internal bankruptcy and misery			2
" and he is also upset by the increasingly negative view of @entity6 that many overseas seem to hold			2
" i am very distraught that the world believes @entity6 are lazy and useless			2
i am very disappointed to watch everyone lose faith in @entity6 and mistake our inadequate political establishment with everyone else in this country , " he said			1
" we want our @entity29 ' partners ' to help us restore growth and the prospects of the economy , but nobody is willing anymore , and that is a disheartening realization			2
" @entity0 's @entity354 contributed to this report .			0
