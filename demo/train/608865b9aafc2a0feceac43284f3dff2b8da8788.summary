@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has reacted angrily to a @entity5 congressional panel decision to pass a resolution calling the 1915 killing of @entity8 in @entity3 a genocide			1
@entity3 recalled its envoy to the @entity5 and condemned the narrow 23 - 22 vote in favor by the @entity13 recommending that the @entity5 recognize the killings as genocide			2
here two experts on @entity3 -- dr @entity17 , lecturer in @entity18 at the @entity19 and @entity20 , @entity3 analyst at @entity22 , a @entity0 - based think tank -- explain why this is such an emotional issue for the country			1
why is this a sensitive issue for @entity3 ? @entity27 : it has always been a sensitive issue ... @entity3 has always refused to accept that it was a planned event			1
they argue that genocide only applies if it was a plan to exterminate people			0
@entity20 : @entity3 says " yes , @entity8 did die , " but disputes the historical definition as a genocide ... it says they died in war , of disease , from the general chaos at the time , but the deaths were not part of a deliberate systematic plan to eliminate the @entity8			1
they say that intention is an important part of genocide			0
why did the @entity13 vote on this now ? @entity20 : on april 24 each year the president of the @entity5 makes a traditional statement commemorating the 1915 killings and i suspect the timing of this is related to that			2
could this harm @entity5 - @entity3 relations ? @entity20 : if the resolution was passed then it could cause lasting damage ... although this is not the first time the two countries have been through this			2
in 2007 the recommendation vote was 27 - 21 so the vote has narrowed this time			0
@entity64 ( @entity5 secretary of state ) says that passing the resolution would damage @entity5 / @entity3 relations , although i think this is a fig leaf and the real reason is @entity5 national security			0
@entity3 is militarily important to the @entity5 ... it has a military base at @entity71 and in february several senior defense staff signed a letter asking for the resolution to be withdrawn			0
@entity27 : @entity5 - @entity3 relations have been going through a relative low in the last few years ... there is less warmth in the relationship , but the relationship has been strong for a decade and is very strong on a variety of issues and @entity3 will deal with it now			0
do any countries recognize the killing of @entity8 in @entity3 in 1915 as genocide ? @entity20 : twenty countries do , including @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			1
@entity90 in 1981 is the only @entity5 president who asked for the killings to be called a genocide			0
what is the public opinion in @entity3 regarding the @entity8 massacre ? @entity27 : relations between the military and the government is the key issue for many @entity101 , i think this ( @entity8 massacre ) is a secondary issue			2
@entity20 : @entity3 is becoming more and more liberal ... genocide is no longer a taboo word when it comes to talking about @entity8 and things have been progressing , but the population does not like foreign powers defining their history , it generates a lot of misgivings			1
could this reverse the tentative measures @entity3 and @entity8 have taken to normalize relations ? @entity27 : it depends on how profound the event is ... although it is one of many events			1
the relationship with @entity3 is a new one and the @entity101 government has invested in it .			0
