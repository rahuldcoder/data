@entity0 -- when the nation 's capital was turned upside down friday with the announcement that justice @entity6 was retiring after 40 years on the federal bench , he was miles away from the political circus -- literally and figuratively			1
the 89 - year - old justice was quietly working on his caseload at his @entity11 , @entity12 , condo , a second home that serves as his occasional refuge from the high - pressure atmosphere of the @entity16 @entity15			1
it is doubtful his replacement will soon find any sanctuary in what could be a protracted fight over the shaky ideological balance of a mostly conservative high court			2
the 112th justice , by most measures , will have a tough act to follow , as he or she seeks to navigate the complex dynamics of a divided bench and gain a measure of the level of influence @entity6 enjoyed for the past two decades and more			1
" he is undoubtedly a leader on the court , " said @entity35 , a former @entity6 law clerk who is writing a book about him			1
names added to @entity15 short list she predicted president @entity42 will replace a liberal with a liberal , " and although the vote change [ on a 5 - 4 conservative majority ] may not alter very much in the short run , the absence of @entity6 ' leadership , his ability to build coalitions along people with very different ideas about things , will be something that will be hard to replace in the short term			1
" short - term considerations drive much of the politics over who the nominee will and should be			2
progressives worry @entity42 may not get another high court pick and urge him to name a forceful advocate for the left			1
" the president now has an opportunity to name a worthy successor who will stand up for equal justice for all , not just the wealthy or powerful , " said @entity65 , president of @entity66 , which describes itself as a national organization dedicated to advancing justice and democracy			1
the most important number at the court the late liberal lion , justice @entity80 , was noted for saying the most important number at the court was five , the votes need to command a majority on the nine - member bench			2
such practical concerns also figure in the @entity87 calculus over whether their nominee will pass @entity91 muster without fear of a filibuster			2
" the court needs a consensus - builder just as much as it needs a progressive firebrand , " said @entity94 , president of the @entity95 , which describes itself as a " think tank , law firm and action center dedicated to fulfilling the progressive promise of our @entity101 's text and history			1
" " president @entity42 's next nominee needs to improve upon [ @entity110 ] @entity109 's performance by articulating the differences between judicial conservatives and progressives and focusing on how the @entity101 and the law itself point in a progressive direction			1
" administration officials quietly acknowledge the desire to excite liberals in an election year with an outspoken judge willing to take on the right			0
they also know @entity42 has his own liberal , but restrained			2
most of his federal judicial nominees thus far have been noncontroversial , center - left candidates			0
many liberal activists say the president may be inclined to go the same route , choosing a nominee who will be spared a bruising confirmation			2
for their part , many conservative activists would not mind a fight , and their early rhetoric suggests they anticipate one			0
the @entity139 , a conservative advocacy group , warned @entity42 against " packing the @entity15 with rubber stamps instead of judges			1
to an activist judge , the @entity101 represents an inconvenient truth that they will distort , ignore , or defy to push their radical liberal agenda			0
" grudging acknowledgement some conservative groups grudgingly acknowledge @entity6 ' influence and his ability to pull conservatives like @entity152 and @entity153 onto his side in hot button - cases			1
when the chief justice is on the losing side of a case , @entity6 -- as senior associate justice -- gets to assign who writes the all - important opinion			1
that opinion becomes the voice of the court , whence its strength and influence derive			0
@entity153 , for example , supported the liberal bloc in upholding affirmative action for college admissions in 2003 and was rewarded by being selected to articulate her view of the necessity , but also the limits , of diversity in school selection			0
that same year , @entity152 joined four liberal justices in striking down state laws that banned homosexual sodomy and wrote a forceful opinion			0
he also issued landmark rulings against applying the death penalty for juvenile killers and those sentenced to die for non-homicides			0
@entity6 ' willingness to put aside ego and to rule narrowly on hot - button cases -- combined with an unmatched cordiality and kindness -- earned him quiet power and respect			1
" the distinctive thing about @entity6 that 's going to be hardest to replace is his attention to the individual case and his willingness to decide it in a way that really is n't determined by ideology , " said @entity192 , a former @entity6 law clerk and author of " the next justice : repairing the @entity201			1
" " his intelligence , of course , has made him a very important contributor to that , but i think it 's really that distinctiveness to his approach that will be toughest to replace			0
" in some ways , the nomination of @entity109 last year represented perfect timing in a perfect political climate -- a president still in the glow of his first months on the job and the political desire to name a woman and a @entity219 that put other liberal constituencies at bay			1
she was a candidate with a sterling resume who deftly maneuvered her way to confirmation			0
this time will be different , when the options are wider			0
some advocacy groups have weighed in			0
groups already weighing in " we call on president @entity42 to nominate a woman to fill this seat , " said @entity233 president @entity232			1
" the @entity15 is out of balance , with women making up a mere 22 percent of the bench			1
that 's simply not enough			0
" who else has a stake ? should @entity42 : -- name a non-judge or politician ? how about @entity246 gov. @entity245 or @entity248 gov. @entity247 ? sens. @entity249 , @entity250 , and @entity251 , @entity252 , are frequently mentioned			2
and supporters of secretary of state @entity254 sing her praises , though the @entity87 monday tempered that talk by saying the president wanted her in her current job			0
-- how about an articulate academic ? @entity262 professors @entity261 and @entity263 have earned progressive praise			0
-- there are no @entity266 on the high court , or the federal appeals courts for that matter			0
@entity270 , formerly dean at @entity271 and now a top @entity273 lawyer is a @entity274 who would represent another history - making choice			0
" the president does n't seem to have the perfect - storm candidate this time that he did with @entity109 , " said @entity277 , a top @entity0 attorney and founder of @entity279			1
" there 's a delicate balance here			2
i think he 's likely to appoint somebody who 's more on the center left , someone like @entity109 who the president believes really shares his values as a judge , but does n't generate the kind of political heat that would disrupt politics over the summer			1
" meanwhile , @entity6 remains his usual apolitical self , detached from the political storm			2
as usual , he 'll find time for his twice weekly tennis matches with his daughter			0
he returns to the bench next week for oral arguments , then will finish writing his remaining opinions			0
in two and a half months he will be gone from the court , but not forgotten .			0

@entity1 's @entity307 says president @entity42 has tough choice to make
retiring justice @entity6 had earned grudging respect from the right
@entity42 must balance competing pressures from liberals , conservatives , @entity307 says
@entity307 : this @entity15 nominee likely faces *choppier* water than @entity109 did
