@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 special operations teams that led the @entity4 invasion in @entity6 a decade ago did something that no @entity4 military had done since the last century : ride horses into combat			1
" it was like out of the @entity14 , " says lt. col. @entity11 , retired @entity15 , who commanded the three horseback teams			1
" you expected @entity19 to be filming and @entity20 to walk out			2
" @entity11 spoke while sitting in the rural @entity1 studio of sculptor @entity22 , along with three of his former " horse soldiers			1
" they , along with 30 fellow commandos on horseback , are the inspiration for a new monument that @entity22 is creating , dedicated to the entire @entity4 special operations community			1
the statue is scheduled to be erected across from the @entity29 in @entity30 on november 11 , @entity31			1
the artist rounded up these " horse soldiers " to share their personal stories and mission photos as inspiration for the 18 - foot , bronze monument			1
" it was unbelievable in 2001 , " master sgt. @entity39 says to @entity22			1
@entity39 , the team 's @entity41 special operations combat controller , who is now retired , sports a @entity44 - style mustache			1
" we all looked at each other [ and said ] ' we 're witnessing a cavalry charge ! ' " he said			2
@entity22 listens in awe to the elite fighters in his art studio			2
he says he felt compelled to sculpt the monument after then - defense secretary @entity52 first held up a photo of these special operations forces on horseback in northern @entity6 during a 2001 news conference			1
" the image , i think , typifies the special operations mission of get the job done , however you have to do it , adapt , overcome , " the artist tells @entity11 and his fellow fighters			1
that image has also captured the imagination of @entity67 blockbuster producer @entity65 , who 's making a movie based on the mission as told by @entity71 in his @entity73 best - selling book , " horse soldiers : the @entity75 to victory in @entity6			1
" @entity22 learns that the inspirational photo was shot by one of the " killer elite " sitting casually in front of him in his art studio			2
the horse soldiers ' stories " if we wanted to move , horses were the only way , " said master sgt. @entity83 , the team 's communication sergeant , who serves with 5th @entity85			1
" nobody will believe this ! ( so ) i take my camera and ( shoot ) that photo			2
" @entity11 points at that famous photo , explaining to @entity22 : " the @entity95 and intelligence officers ( @entity97 ) are clotted up in front together , and all our guys are spread out in a wedge behind them			2
" for most of the @entity4 , it was their first time on a horse			1
but , their mission was critical : synchronize tribal warfare against @entity108 and @entity109 enemies by riding with , and advising , rival @entity111 warlords			2
5 voices on @entity6 success the artist touches a bridle and an @entity95 saddle the team brought from @entity119 , @entity120 , which are registered with the @entity121			1
one of the nation 's leading equestrian sculptors , @entity22 is fascinated with the little - known details of these special operators ' horseback mission in the steep , mountain terrain of @entity6			1
" were you worried about the footing of the horse ? " the sculptor asks the team			1
" absolutely , " replies @entity39 , the @entity41 combat controller			2
" they were trying to scramble up the rocks , and their hooves , their shoes were sparking			2
you were worried about sliding off anytime , but you had to keep going			2
" in the male - dominated @entity95 culture , all war horses are stallions ; there were no mares			2
the team tells the artist the stallions were constantly biting , kicking and rearing			0
" it was like riding a bobcat , " @entity11 says			0
" that 's another big reason we separated , especially at night , when we 're walking on that ledge , because you put two horses together , all they wanted to do was fight			0
you look down at the left side , there 's a 500 - foot drop - off , " @entity39 adds			0
" it was a sheer cliff , " explains sgt. 1st class @entity157 , the team 's @entity15 medic and sniper , who currently serves at @entity161			0
" if someone would have fallen off , we would not have known , " master sgt. @entity83 says			0
that almost happened to @entity157			0
when his horse slid backward , he jumped off , and the horse landed on him			2
" it was the first week			0
winded up breaking my back , " @entity157 says quietly			0
the sculptor 's eyes are wide ; his hand rubs his chin			0
" so , you rode the rest of the mission with a broken back ? " @entity22 asks			0
" @entity181 , " @entity157 answers , " two shots of morphine to relieve the pain , and get back on the horse			2
i would not allow myself to be the weak link			0
it 's not in my nature , and it 's not in any @entity15 's nature			0
" @entity157 and the others were each handpicked for this special operation by @entity11 , who carried a piece of the @entity29 during their entire mission advising the rival @entity111 warlords			1
" there were suspicions about our motives , " @entity11 says to the artist			0
" i pulled the bent piece of steel out and showed it to them [ and said , ] ' this is why we 're here : we simply want to ensure that it 's not a sanctuary for terrorist forces that have attacked the @entity4			1
' " @entity22 looks through the men 's photos of the aftermath of a major battle in @entity209 showing bodies and rubble from @entity41 bombs			0
he realizes at that point just how tough the special operations forces ' mission was , right after the september 11 attacks			1
@entity95 man reflects on war , 10 years later the battlefield is far removed from his studio , littered not with the carnage of war but with the dust and scraps from his sculpture			0
after that @entity209 - e @entity229 battle , as @entity15 medic @entity157 was treating wounded prisoners at a prison camp , he recalls hearing an odd voice nearby			0
" the accent was not there			0
something just did n't sound right , it just did n't add up , " he says			0
he got up and told the @entity4 intelligence agents who were questioning other prisoners			1
a linguistics specialist came over to help @entity157 treat another patient			0
" he was listening to the conversation [ and ] immediately scooped him up , " @entity157 recalls			0
" it turned out to be @entity241			0
" it was @entity243 , the so - called @entity4 @entity108 from @entity244			1
@entity22 sits forward in his chair			0
to him , the idea that an @entity4 was fighting alongside the men who helped carry out the 9/11 attacks is unthinkable			1
months later , after the @entity108 regime had fallen , the special operations teams chose @entity209 -- the site of one of their fiercest battles and where @entity97 officer @entity254 became the first @entity4 killed in action in @entity6 -- to bury the piece of the @entity29 that @entity11 had carried their entire mission			1
" we took this piece of steel , put it in a body bag , folded @entity4 colors over it as when we lay our heroes to rest at @entity264 , " @entity11 explains to @entity22			1
" we thought that this piece of the @entity29 [ should ] be buried in a spot that was full of @entity109 terrorists and memorialized			1
" the monument takes shape ten years later , these horse soldiers ' stories will be memorialized in @entity22 's monument across from the @entity29			1
it will be unveiled during the november 11 @entity31 parade , with the help of @entity30 firefighters , police officers , other emergency responders and @entity279 members			1
" it will pay tribute to all @entity4 special operations forces , " @entity22 tells the team			1
" it will give @entity30 an opportunity to honor the veterans who , worldwide , acted as @entity30 's ' second responders ' directly after the attack			0
" members of @entity290 banking firms , who were personally affected by the attack at the @entity29 , commissioned the artist			1
they ask to remain anonymous , so the focus stays on the meaning of the monument			2
" they are an ad hoc group of grateful @entity290 bankers who personally survived and lost friends and many associates in the 9/11 attacks , " @entity22 says			0
" they , and their community surrounding the @entity29 , were permanently affected by the event			1
no public funds are being used			0
" in a @entity310 office , two of those individual supporters are helping organize this at a grass - roots level			0
they say that after the attacks , and the years of war that followed , their families and friends across the country asked them : where could they go to remember the @entity4 troops overseas who are trying to tackle potential terrorist threats , every day ? " we wanted to do something for the special operations community and all military service branches , because every day since 9/11 , we 've had to look at that hole in the ground , " one of the private backers says			1
a piece of @entity29 steel may be embedded in the monument 's base			1
the statue will be installed on private property , owned by a supportive firm , close to ground zero			0
back in @entity1 , @entity22 asks the horse soldiers assembled in his studio if they are concerned about whether anti-military groups , or detractors , will criticize the monument as glamorizing warfare			1
" it 's just not about the soldiers that have fallen , it 's about those that were in the towers , those that were on flight 93 , and the @entity351 ; the children that lost their mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters , " medic @entity157 tells the sculptor			2
" what everyone needs to know is : there are people out there like this team , like the @entity85 , that are willing to sacrifice at all costs for them			0
" @entity83 , the communications sergeant who shot the photo that originally compelled the artist , agrees			0
" these are the guys that have your back			0
these are the guys that are now watching an eternal vigil over ground zero			0
the falling of these towers launched us off on horseback			2
now , we 're watching over you , and we have your back			0
that 's what this statue is symbolizing			0
