@entity0 -- the @entity3 bid for statehood at the @entity0 was effectively stalled friday after the @entity5 approved a report stating its inability " to make a unanimous recommendation			1
" " we knew from the beginning ... that we might not be able to succeed in the @entity5 because there is a powerful country that has the veto power , " said @entity9 , the @entity3 envoy to the @entity0			1
he said that he believed the report was " objective			0
" the @entity16 has been vocal about its intention to veto any @entity3 bid for statehood			1
last week , @entity20 and the @entity21 said they would abstain from the vote			0
those three nations , along with @entity25 and @entity26 , have veto power in the @entity5			0
" we thought that with diligent diplomatic efforts , with success at the @entity31 , of being admitted in the @entity0 system as the state of @entity34 ... that @entity34 would be admitted as a member state , " @entity9 said			2
@entity31 is the @entity31 , which recently granted the @entity37 full membership the report , written by a special @entity5 committee and obtained by @entity1 , was the result of seven weeks of meetings			0
it details myriad disagreements between the council members on whether @entity34 fulfills the requirements set forth in the @entity0 charter for members countries			1
by contrast , when the committee met to discuss the application of @entity50 -- a territory and now country involved in no small dispute of its own -- it came to an agreement after a single 10 - minute meeting			2
according to the charter , countries seeking membership must be " peace - loving , " " accept the obligations " of the @entity0 charter , and " willing and able to carry out " those obligations			1
according to the report , the 15 council members fall into three categories : those countries that support @entity3 membership , those that ca n't support it at this time ( for whom abstention was envisaged in the event of a vote ) , and those countries that say the requirements were not met and could n't vote for recommendation			1
in order for a vote to take place , one of the 15 council members must request it			1
diplomats say , however , that the ball is largely in the @entity3 ' court to push for a vote			2
were a council resolution to pass , the membership bid would be forwarded to the @entity87 , where passage is all but assured			0
a vote in the near term does not seem likely			0
but should it take place , diplomats say that the @entity3 are unlikely to get even the nine votes necessary for a resolution to pass , because of a large number of abstentions			2
the @entity16 veto would effectively be moot			0
" the @entity3 have to make their own choice as to how to proceed , " said @entity99 , the @entity16 ambassador to the @entity0			1
" the @entity16 has made its own views quite clear , both directly to the @entity3 and to the larger international community and the council membership			1
we 'll look to see what they choose to do			0
" the next step for the @entity3 remains unclear			2
they could sidestep the @entity5 and go straight to the @entity87 , where they would get an upgraded observer status , matching that of the @entity110 , but not full membership			0
@entity37 president @entity112 , however , has said that they will not pursue that option			0
@entity112 is set to meet with the leadership of the @entity116 next week			0
@entity0 diplomats say that the @entity3 ' next step may become more clear after that meeting .			1

a report details myriad disagreements between the council members
many question @entity3 ' ability to meet @entity0 charter obligations
a country must be a " peace - loving " country , says the charter
