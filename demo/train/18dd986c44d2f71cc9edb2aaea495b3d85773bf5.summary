@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity4 , the @entity6 - based 24 - hour news broadcaster , will not show a controversial appeal for aid for the people of @entity10 , it announced monday			1
protesters demonstrate in @entity1 sunday against the @entity13 's decision not to show @entity10 aid appeal			1
@entity4 joins the @entity13 in refusing to show the appeal by the @entity16 , an umbrella group of 13 leading @entity6 aid agencies			1
the @entity13 , @entity6 's public broadcaster , has been criticized by politicians and religious leaders for refusing to show the appeal , which launches monday			1
there have been demonstrations against the decision at @entity13 buildings in @entity0 and @entity26			1
@entity4 said airing the appeal would compromise its reputation for fairness			1
do you agree with the decision ? send your comments " broadcasting an appeal for @entity10 at this time is incompatible with our role in providing balanced and objective reporting of this continuing situation to our audiences in the @entity6 and around the world , " @entity4 , the head of @entity4 , said monday in a statement on the company 's web site			1
the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) includes the @entity6 @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and 10 other charities			1
@entity6 broadcasters , led by the @entity13 , originally declined to air the @entity10 appeal , but in the face of criticism from government ministers and others , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 changed their minds			1
@entity2 was not approached to broadcast the ad , a @entity16 spokesman said			2
about 5,000 people demonstrated in front of the @entity13 's @entity64 in central @entity1 on saturday over the broadcaster 's stance			2
about 50 people protested at its @entity70 headquarters sunday			0
the corporation received about 1,000 phone calls and 10,000 e-mails of complaint in the three days after it announced its decision thursday			0
but the @entity13 is sticking with its position , director general @entity77 wrote in a blog post on the corporation 's web site			2
" we concluded that we could not broadcast a free - standing appeal , no matter how carefully constructed , without running the risk of reducing public confidence in the @entity13 's impartiality in its wider coverage of the story , " he wrote saturday			1
" inevitably an appeal would use pictures which are the same or similar to those we would be using in our news programs but would do so with the objective of encouraging public donations			0
the danger for the @entity13 is that this could be interpreted as taking a political stance on an ongoing story , " he wrote			2
" @entity10 remains a major ongoing news story , in which humanitarian issues -- the suffering and distress of civilians and combatants on both sides of the conflict , the debate about who is responsible for causing it and what should be done about it -- are both at the heart of the story and contentious , " he added			2
the @entity13 , which is funded by an obligatory license fee paid by every @entity6 household with a television , is required by its charter to be impartial			2
the @entity16 is " disappointed that the @entity13 declined to support the @entity10 appeal , " a spokesman told @entity2			1
" it might limit the reach of our key message to the general public			0
" the spokesman , who asked not to be named , said the @entity13 had to make its own decision about impartiality			2
" that is a decision they must make			0
we have no view on that subject , " he said			0
many readers of @entity77 's blog post did have a view , however			0
the statement received hundreds of comments , most of them critical of the @entity13			0
a commenter who signed in as bully -- baiter said the @entity13 was taking a side no matter what it did			0
" sorry mr. @entity77 but you can not have it both ways			0
if deciding to accede to the @entity16 request would be seen as political then deciding not to accede to it is also political			0
do n't insult me with your disingenuous attempts to suggest it is otherwise , " the commenter wrote			0
other commenters simply rejected @entity77 's position out of hand			0
" i think the reasons for blocking help for a grave humanitarian disaster are simply astounding , " brit -- proud wrote			0
" how can simply bringing food , medicines and homes to hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians be seen as political impartiality ? how stupid do the @entity13 think the @entity6 public are ? " the corporation had its defenders as well			1
" the last thing i want to do , is fund the @entity13 to broadcast propaganda , " @entity166 wrote : " there 's no way i will pay the @entity13 to air the @entity16 's politically - motivated ' appeal ' for @entity10			1
@entity10 is run by a government which is internationally recognized as a terrorist group , including by the @entity176			2
there is no doubt that some aid / fund will be ' procured ' by @entity180 ...			0
" @entity6 broadcasters have refused to air some previous @entity16 appeals , the umbrella organization 's spokesman said			1
a planned 2006 appeal for aid to victims of the war in @entity190 was scrapped because " there were genuine concerns , shared by the aid agencies , about the deliverability of aid			0
" @entity77 cited doubts about whether @entity16 members could get aid to @entity10 as a secondary reason for declining to take the ad .			1

@entity4 said airing the appeal would compromise its reputation for fairness
