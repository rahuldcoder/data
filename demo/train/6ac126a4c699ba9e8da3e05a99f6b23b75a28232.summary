the first significant new museum of @entity2 art in nearly half a century debuted in 2011			1
but to view @entity4 ' collection — from a @entity6 portrait of @entity7 to @entity9 canvases — you do n't travel to @entity11 , @entity12 or @entity13			0
you head down a forested ravine in a town in northwestern @entity17			2
as museum founder and @entity20 heiress @entity18 scooped up tens of millions of dollars ' worth of art from across the country , thinly veiled snobbish rhetoric began to trickle out from the coasts			1
most notably , when she purchased @entity27 's @entity26 from the @entity28 for $ 35 million , some culturati bristled at the thought that this famed @entity31 landscape would be leaving for @entity32			0
the controversy raised the question : who deserves access to great art ? yet a small town is precisely the kind of place where a stellar art collection fits in			1
after all , coastal hamlets , mountaintop villages and desert whistle - stops have inspired @entity2 artists for generations , among them , the @entity48 of @entity50 's @entity49 and the minimalist installation artists who more recently gentrified @entity53			1
where else can you find the mix of affordable rents , access to inspiring natural vistas and enough peace and quiet to actually get work done ? many small towns also offer detour - worthy museums , some housed in spectacular historic spaces — old factories , former army bases , @entity69 estates , @entity71 mansions — and others built from scratch by internationally renowned architects like @entity75 and @entity77 firm @entity76			1
and with works inside just as varied , from landscape paintings at the @entity80 to minimalist installations at @entity82 : beacon to @entity2 folk art at the @entity85 , you 're sure to find a small - town art museum to suit any artistic taste			1
@entity88 : @entity90 's best ice cream shops @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity50 when iron industrialist @entity94 began buying @entity96 @entity48 masterpieces , the movement was still stirring outrage across @entity98 for its radical departure from tradition			0
but you 'd never know it from the intimate , even cozy , atmosphere at the @entity91 , which places these works in the same context in which @entity94 would have enjoyed them — surrounded by antiques and period federal - , @entity109 - and @entity111 - style furnishings in his hilltop estate outside of @entity113			1
like the works you 'll find inside , by @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 , the house itself now seems lovely and genteel			0
but it also comes with a radical back story : the @entity125 mansion , completed in 1901 , was designed by @entity94 's own daughter , only the fourth registered female architect in @entity2 history			0
@entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 @entity129 's @entity128 raises many questions			0
you might wonder what an avant - garde museum is doing in a @entity136 beach town known for its casinos and sunshine			1
or how starchitect @entity139 got involved in a project dedicated to obscure 19th - century ceramicist @entity141			1
or how this place is even still standing			0
during construction , @entity143 slammed an unmoored casino barge directly into the unfinished buildings			2
any lack of logic seems appropriate in honoring @entity141 , a true eccentric who dubbed himself the @entity151 of @entity129 and was known for his delightfully misshapen , brightly colored pottery			0
opened in 2010 in a thicket of live oaks , the museum encompasses brick - and - steel pavilions , twisted egg - shaped pods and examples of 19th - century vernacular architecture , with galleries on @entity161 , ceramics and @entity136 history			1
the @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 @entity165 is named for the tiny republic on the @entity169 peninsula			0
and it 's an appropriate connection for the @entity164 , where the vibe is distinctly @entity98 , thanks to 120 manicured acres ( reserve ahead for the @entity174 , surrounded by a rose garden ) and a collection skewed to @entity178 classics			0
the @entity179 has the largest collection of 18th - and 19th - century @entity182 art outside of @entity183 — including works by @entity185 and @entity186			1
other galleries within this @entity69 estate cover @entity190 paintings and 18th - century sculpture as well as the furniture of @entity193 and paintings by @entity120 and @entity195			1
a @entity196 from the 1450s and an illuminated manuscript of @entity200 's @entity199 are among the library 's gems			0
@entity88 : the best apps and websites for travelers @entity206 and @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 college towns offer more than beautiful campuses , tradition - rich bars and football			1
many can also brag about world - class art collections			1
case in point : @entity217 's new @entity206 and @entity207			0
it 's the first - ever university building designed by @entity219 -- winner @entity75 and only her second project in @entity90			2
the corrugated stainless steel and glass facade juts sharply like a ship — or perhaps more accurately a spaceship — run aground			0
while the collection is primarily contemporary , the curators included some classic works to better contextualize the newer acquisitions			0
so you can expect @entity232 paintings , 19th - century @entity2 paintings and 20th - century sculpture , along with artifacts from ancient @entity236 , @entity237 and the @entity238			1
@entity239 , @entity240 , @entity11 low - slung and shedlike , with its corrugated tin roof and parallel 615 - foot slabs of poured concrete , @entity242 's newest art museum features a style that might be called @entity248			1
surrounded by a meadow of tall grasses on the long road to @entity253 , the museum is a minimalist stunner that 's perfectly suited to its surroundings : the long horizontal space speaks both to the uninterrupted horizons of the region 's famed beaches and to the unfussy simplicity that first attracted artists like @entity9 , @entity262 and @entity263			1
inside , under an ever - changing glow from skylights above , the collection honors the generations of artists who called this area home , such as @entity2 impressionist @entity269 and mid-century realist @entity270			1
in 2014 , it won @entity77 firm @entity76 a @entity274 for best museum			2
@entity276 , @entity85 , @entity277 most art collectors limit purchases to what they can hang on the walls or set on their mantelpieces			2
but sugar heiress @entity283 had grander plans			0
after amassing @entity31 landscapes , quirky folk art , quilts , decoys , toys and circus posters , @entity285 decided she needed somewhere to put it all			2
so she set out doing what she did best : collecting			0
from across @entity294 and @entity11 , @entity285 gathered 18th - and 19th - century structures — houses , barns , a schoolhouse , a jail , a general store , a lighthouse and a steamboat — and set them up on 45 acres of farmland near @entity304 , where she founded the @entity276 in 1947			1
more than 150,000 pieces are on display and more accessible than ever ; the 2013 opening of the @entity309 allowed the formerly seasonal @entity85 to stay open year - round			1
@entity310 , @entity53 , @entity311 the @entity310 is massive by design			0
@entity317 up with the cramped galleries of @entity11 and the need to constantly rotate exhibits , minimalist sculptor @entity313 decamped to this tiny former railroad stop in the @entity319 in 1971			0
nearly 200 miles from an airport and surrounded on all sides by scrub grasslands , @entity53 is blessed , above all else , with space			0
@entity313 teamed with the @entity324 to transform a decommissioned army base into the 340 - acre arts compound			2
here and in a number of buildings downtown , works are given room to breathe			2
a hundred of @entity313 's trademark aluminum boxes fill two old brick artillery sheds ; @entity335 's light installations occupy six barracks ; @entity338 's volcanic stone pieces sit on an old tennis court ; and @entity341 's painted steel sculptures are in the @entity342 and @entity343			2
$ 25 , full collection tour			0
@entity88 : the world 's coolest museum gift shops @entity348 , @entity349 , @entity7 opened in june 2013 in the waterfront town of @entity349 , @entity348 is just a five - minute walk from the ferry terminal that brings passengers across @entity354 from @entity355			1
but @entity348 's curators are n't concerned with any big - city competition			2
they 've honed in with a laser - like focus on contemporary fine arts and crafts from a very small radius : the @entity363 and @entity364 peninsulas and the @entity365			1
it 's all on view in a dazzling glass building that reflects the region 's eco-friendly spirit			0
with its rooftop garden , recycled - denim insulation , solar panels , geothermal wells and sustainable tigerwood siding , @entity348 is on track to become the first @entity377 -- certified museum in the state — and among the first in the nation			1
@entity4 , @entity32 , @entity17 casting her curatorial net ( and considerable wealth ) far and wide , @entity18 gathered centuries of exceptional @entity2 art , from the colonial era up to the present			2
the works by @entity6 , @entity388 , @entity389 and @entity9 , to name just a few , would make any big city proud			0
but @entity391 set her project in a place critically underserved by cultural institutions , the @entity396 town of @entity32 , where @entity391 opened his first five and dime			0
designed by @entity400 - @entity2 architect @entity399 with an eye toward connecting with the landscape , the museum is made up of eight interconnected galleries built in and around spring - fed pools , surrounded by forests , ravines and miles of hiking trails			1
it helped inspire the opening of 21c , a nearby art - filled boutique hotel with a locavore restaurant			2
@entity412 , @entity413 , @entity414 the repurposed 19th - century brick buildings that make up @entity412 's 13 - acre campus are forever linked with northwestern @entity414 ' industrial heritage			1
these buildings housed textile manufacturers , then @entity420 , which produced parts for the atomic bomb and the @entity423			0
when @entity425 left in 1985 , the site was historically significant but unwieldy — a superfund contamination site also listed on the @entity427			0
the director of the @entity429 came looking for a raw space for larger - than - life installations			0
after more than a decade of renovations , @entity412 opened in 1999			0
now artist residencies mean that works of art — visual , music , dance , film , theater — are being created on the very same floors where forward - thinking advances have been developed for 150 years			2
