@entity0 -- crossing borders as a transgender woman is always a challenge			1
there are many reasons immigration authorities reject you , but sometimes it 's simply because they do n't seem to understand who we are			0
my name is @entity14 and i was born in @entity15 , @entity16			1
i 'm a trained pharmacist and speak five languages fluently , and until recently , i was studying for an mba in @entity19 in @entity20 on a government scholarship			1
i also used to be a man			0
last year , i was forced to travel to @entity0 to renew my passport because of my altered gender			1
@entity0 -- a one - hour flight away -- is the nearest @entity16 consulate from @entity20			1
the trip was also necessary to allow me to apply for the second year of my graduate degree			2
little did i know my life would be turned upside down when i boarded that plane			0
confusion , hostility on arrival at @entity0 's sprawling international airport , immigration officials reacted with a combination of confusion and hostility after looking at my travel documents			1
i arrived as a woman but my passport identified me as a man			2
it had n't occurred to me to check the implications of changing my sex on my freedom to travel and the way i 'd be treated			1
i was immediately refused entry and told that i was facing being deported			0
i was detained in a cramped room at the airport and permitted access to the male toilet only , despite my repeated requests to be allowed to use the female facilities			0
[ the @entity55 department told @entity1 in a statement that according to their procedures they have to take into account the gender as indicated on the passport			2
as @entity14 's passport still carried the " male " gender marker , officials had to follow procedures for those identified as men			1
] a deportation letter was soon issued to me , which meant @entity0 authorities were forcing me to leave			1
i feared i 'd be sent back to @entity16 , a place i had left because i suffered discrimination and violent abuse -- including two murder attempts -- precisely because i 'm transgender			1
after hours of crying and appeals to all my @entity74 friends using my smartphone , several lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( @entity78 ) rights groups in @entity0 contacted me and appealed to immigration officials to give me permission to enter the city			1
[ two independent sources with knowledge of this case told @entity87 's release was secured via the local @entity16 consulate			1
once consular officials were notified , they secured her conditional release , meaning she could enter @entity0 but not leave for anywhere but @entity16			1
as a result , she filed a refugee claim with the local @entity95 office			2
] @entity96 while the process to become a refugee can take years , the situation was so clear for the agency that full status was conferred in only 12 days			1
september 30 last year marked the day i became a " stateless person			0
" i had effectively surrendered my nationality			0
[ while the @entity95 does n't comment on specific cases for the security of the refugee status claimant , they provided the following statement to @entity1 : " an applicant 's sexual orientation and / or gender identity can be relevant to a refugee claim where he or she fears persecutory harm on account of his or her actual or perceived sexual orientation and / or gender identity			1
" ] yet i was still holding a deportation letter from @entity0			1
my fear of being deported to a place where i am not allowed to be myself and where exposing myself could lead me to face death , forced me to request resettlement with the @entity95 and forget the life i had built in @entity20			1
inner identity since i was six years old , i knew that my physical gender did not match my inner feelings and inner identity , and i had to grow in the wrong way being a person i was not			0
i tried to be myself in my room several times as a teen , by dressing in women 's clothes , but when i was in my 20s i decided to show the world the person i really was			0
i needed courage to go out on the streets as @entity14 knowing the hazards that existed in a dangerous city like @entity142			1
@entity16 is a country where machismo , transphobia and homophobia are deeply ingrained in society			1
@entity147 accounts for 80 % of globally reported trans - people murders since 2008 , from a total of 643 cases -- according to the @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 ( @entity157 ) , a @entity159 - based @entity158			0
of that figure , @entity16 alone accounts for around 12 % of cases			1
in @entity20 i found a safe place to be myself , where i could start my medical treatment and my transition from male to female , while working towards my @entity167 -- fulfilling a double dream of being @entity14 and advancing my career			1
over time i could see and feel my body changing			2
i was becoming a woman only a year after the hormone replacement therapy started in @entity20			1
in @entity0 , this medical treatment was as necessary as food and shelter			2
after almost nine months in the city in which local @entity78 group @entity177 made my survival possible , i moved to @entity179 , where i was allowed to reside in a resettlement center			0
@entity0 hardship the situation for refugees in @entity0 is more complicated			2
we are forced to live in miserable conditions , without any control over our lives			2
we are not allowed to work and study , and @entity0 only provides us about us $ 150 per month for food and other basic needs			2
the city 's statutory minimum wage for a 40 - hour - a - week employee is us $ 620 per month			0
i also discovered other perils			0
in october last year , i fainted in the street because i was lacking the medical treatment needed as part of my gender transformation			2
i was sent to the emergency room of the city 's queen elizabeth hospital			0
when they realized who i was , i was given basic treatment and placed in a padded room in a psychiatric ward and restrained on a bed			0
[ a statement from the @entity210 , the government department responsible for public hospitals in @entity0 , said @entity14 " received appropriate clinical treatment and nursing care " and that " all arrangements were made based on the clinical needs of the patient			1
" ] again , @entity177 rescued me			0
the group pleaded at the hospital for my release			0
this followed full @entity95 refugee recognition , which places the person concerned under the agency 's protection			2
[ @entity224 clarified in the same statement to @entity1 that discharge was to " handle ( a ) refugee - related issue			0
" ] for the @entity95 , the process has been very complicated			0
most countries require sex reassignment surgery ; few countries allow gender changes on paper if they were n't done on the body			0
there are few options in terms of countries suitable for me in my situation			0
they include @entity243 , the @entity244 , @entity179 , @entity245 and more recently , @entity246			0
the struggle for many like me continues , but there is always hope			0
when it seems there is not a clear reason to continue fighting , my life still has a meaning -- being myself , being @entity14			2
@entity257 's @entity256 and @entity1 's @entity258 contributed to this report .			0
