-- the phone - hacking scandal engulfing @entity3 's media empire intensified in the @entity4 on wednesday as three senators and a congressman urged federal authorities to investigate whether one of @entity3 's @entity4 - based companies may have violated anti-bribery and other laws			1
a fourth senator told @entity0 he was considering launching his own investigation into the scandal			1
sens. @entity15 , @entity16 , and @entity17 , @entity18 , sent letters to attorney general @entity20 asking @entity20 to look into concerns that @entity22 -- the parent company of @entity23 -- violated the @entity24 , known as the @entity24			1
the law , enacted in 1977 , makes it illegal for a @entity4 person or company to pay foreign officials to obtain or retain business			1
sen. @entity31 , @entity16 , also wrote to @entity20 , asking him to examine whether journalists working for @entity3 may have tapped into the phones of the victims of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			1
rep. @entity36 , @entity38 - @entity37 , asked fbi director @entity39 to investigate that possibility			2
their concerns appear to be traceable to a story published wednesday by the @entity44 , a @entity45 tabloid that includes a section it describes as " gossip gone toxic			1
" the newspaper cited " a source " who referred to a former police officer who now works as a private investigator			2
" the investigator is used by a lot of journalists in @entity4 and he recently told me that he was asked to hack into the 9/11 victims ' private phone data , " the investigator reportedly told the newspaper			1
" he said that the journalists asked him to access records showing the calls that had been made to and from the mobile phones belonging to the victims and their relatives			1
" his presumption was that they wanted the information so they could hack into the relevant voice mails , just like has been shown they have done in the @entity45			2
the @entity71 said he had to turn the job down			2
he knew how insensitive such research would be , and how bad it would look			2
" the investigator said the journalists seemed particularly interested in getting the phone records belonging to the @entity45 victims of the attacks			2
" @entity79 , a 168 - year - old @entity45 newspaper owned by @entity3 , folded sunday in the wake of accusations that its reporters illegally eavesdropped on the phone messages of murder and terrorist victims , politicians and celebrities			2
police in the @entity45 have identified almost 4,000 potential targets of phone hacking			2
there also were reports that reporters may have bribed law enforcement officers			2
" the limited information already reported in this case raises serious questions about the legality of the conduct of @entity22 and its subsidiaries under the @entity24 , " @entity15 wrote			1
potential liability flows from journalists at @entity79 to its parent , @entity104 , to its parent , @entity22 , which is a publicly held company in the @entity4			1
sen. @entity106 , @entity107 , told @entity0 tuesday he may start his own investigation			1
" my bet is we 'll find some criminal stuff , " @entity106 said			2
" this is going to be a huge issue			2
" @entity106 said he is also concerned about whether journalists tapped into the phones of the 9/11 victims			1
the @entity117 confirmed wednesday receipt of letters from @entity106 , @entity17 and @entity15			1
" we are reviewing the letters , " said @entity117 spokesperson @entity120 , who declined further comment			1
relatives of the victims of the terrorist attacks expressed outrage wednesday over the possibility they may have been hacking victims			2
what they went through is " heartfelt stuff , and it should n't be out there for all to see unless the family approves , " said @entity135 , a retired @entity136 deputy chief who lost a son in the attacks			0
" until we get some accountability , they 're just going to keep doing it , " @entity135 said			0
" it 's completely unethical , unprofessional and basically criminal			0
" @entity144 , who also lost a son in the attacks , called it " very horrifying that privacy and personal security could be violated in such an egregious manner			0
" " this is a big issue and i think it needs to be dealt with head - on , " she said			0
" no one is above the law			0
... i want to see real action			0
" despite the closure of @entity79 , @entity104 still owns @entity158 , @entity159 and the @entity160 in @entity45			0
@entity22 encompasses not only @entity23 , but also @entity161 , the @entity162 and @entity164 publishers			1
" there does seem to be a basis for a @entity4 investigation at this point , " said @entity165 , a professor of business law at @entity167 in @entity168 , in a telephone interview monday with @entity0 about whether @entity4 law might apply to the hacking scandal in @entity45			1
@entity176 , a former @entity117 cybercrimes prosecutor , told @entity0 a federal investigation " is certainly appropriate to determine what the facts are			1
" " it does n't matter if the intended victims in the @entity4 were @entity4 or @entity45 , " he said			1
" if i hire a ( private investigator ) to break into the records of people in @entity37 , it does n't make a difference			0
" but attorney @entity187 , who helps clients comply with the @entity24 , said he believes a prosecution is unlikely			0
" the chances are very slim unless the payments we know about turn out to be the tip of the iceberg , " he said			0
@entity187 argued that @entity4 authorities are likely to trust the @entity45 legal system -- older than @entity4 itself -- to handle the case			1
@entity4 authorities usually go after cases that are not being prosecuted elsewhere and in which widespread , systematic bribery can be proved , he said			1
@entity22 , he noted , does not fit the bill			1
the biggest case for an @entity24 violation to date involved the @entity206 company @entity205 , which paid $ 1.36 billion in bribes to foreign officials working on projects including the @entity211 ' oil - for - food program in @entity212 and others in @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity218			0
the company paid $ 800 million in fines and penalties for the @entity24 violation			0
but the @entity4 took on that case partly because @entity206 did not prosecute @entity205 , @entity187 said , for what amounted to widespread bribery			1
were a @entity4 case against @entity22 to arise , the potential implications for the @entity3 media empire would be numerous -- and none of them are good , @entity165 said			1
an investigation would most certainly attempt to answer the question of how widespread bribes were within @entity22 were other employees -- all over the world , for that matter -- making similar payments ? the @entity24 stipulates that @entity4 - listed companies , their employees or agents may not make bribes to foreign officials			1
a second portion of the law applies to accounting requirements for public companies , said @entity247 , author of " @entity248 " and a partner with the @entity251 - based law firm of @entity252			0
" they have to keep books and records in reasonable detail that reflect the transactions , " he said			0
so , if a bribe was made and not properly noted , the @entity258 and the @entity117 could each have a case , @entity247 said			1
a telephone call or an e-mail from an editor in @entity264 to his or her boss in @entity37 could prove key , he said			0
" if you send an e-mail to the boss saying , ' i 'm going to pay $ 10,000 to police officers for this information , ' that would provide the jurisdictional basis or potential liability on the part of possibly the @entity45 employees , " @entity247 said			0
if any employee of @entity22 , which is listed in the @entity4 , knew about and authorized such a payment , " they could have potential exposure , " he said			1
and if @entity3 -- the 80 - year - old @entity282 - born head of @entity22 who became a @entity4 citizen in 1985 -- knew what was going on and authorized it , even implicitly , " he could have some potential exposure , " @entity247 said			1
the penalties can be severe , including jail time and fines , he said			0
and ignorance confers no protection			0
" the @entity258 has brought cases against @entity4 companies who had no knowledge of what foreign subsidiaries were doing , but had misbooked it , " he said , adding that the @entity258 blamed the companies for not having set up the internal controls that would have caught the illegal behavior			2
a justice spokeswoman said she could not comment on the possibility of the department 's involvement			0
if the charges wind up being nothing more than civil accounting violations , the @entity258 would handle the case and @entity117 would not become involved , said @entity307 , coordinator of the @entity308 at @entity309 and @entity310 , a @entity251 - based law firm specializing in international regulatory issues , tax and litigation			2
that would still carry a major risk to those involved			0
" the @entity258 has a lot of bite in significant fines , penalties , prohibiting people from serving as officers in public companies , " he said			0
" that can derail a career quickly			0
" but a criminal prosecution by federal prosecutors would be the most to fear , since it would carry the potential of jail time , @entity307 said			0
@entity258 fines can range up to $ 25 million per violation in such cases , but totals regularly exceed $ 100 million because the agency can force the company to disgorge ill - gotten gains			0
the @entity117 can impose a criminal fine on individuals of up to $ 100,000 and five years in prison for each count on a bribery charge , he said			2
multiple counts could lead to higher fines and sequential prison terms			0
but fines are typically pegged to how much a company or an individual gained as a result of the crime , @entity307 said			0
that can be easy to figure out when the subject is a contract , but any case involving @entity3 's empire might present more of a challenge			0
" how many more newspapers did you sell ? " he asked			0
@entity0 's @entity360 , @entity361 , @entity362 , @entity363 , and @entity364 contributed to this report			1
