" that 's the mantra @entity2 said she had this year			1
and that 's exactly what she did			2
on monday , @entity2 became the first person to swim from @entity6 to @entity7 without a protective cage , willing her way to a @entity11 beach just before 2 p.m. et , nearly 53 hours after jumping into the ocean in @entity13 for her fifth try in 35 years			1
shortly after conquering the @entity16 , the 64 - year - old endurance swimmer sat down with @entity18 chief medical correspondent dr. @entity17			1
" it 's all authentic			2
it 's a great story			2
you have a dream 35 years ago -- does n't come to fruition , but you move on with life			0
but it 's somewhere back there			2
then you turn 60 , and your mom just dies , and you 're looking for something			0
and the dream comes waking out of your imagination , " @entity2 said			1
the swim was n't easy			2
" with all the experience i have , especially in this ocean , i never knew i would suffer the way i did , " she said			0
" for 49 hours the wind just blew like heck , and it was rough			0
" at one point , she was vomiting because she had so much salt water in her system and was shivering			0
she sang lullabies to help her relax			0
" it was really rough that first day , saturday , after the start and i just said : ' forget about the surface up			0
get your hands in somehow , and with your left hand , say , push @entity6 back , and push @entity7 towards you , ' " @entity2 said			1
through it all , she held her mantra close : " you do n't like it			0
it 's not doing well			2
" ' you are never too old ' dozens of onlookers -- some in kayaks and boats , many others wading in the water or standing on shore -- gathered to cheer @entity2 on as she finished the more than 100 - mile swim			1
she pumped her fist as she walked onto the beach toward an awaiting medic before being guided to an ambulance			0
" i got three messages , " an exhausted and happy @entity2 told reporters			1
her face was sunburned and swollen			0
" one is we should never , ever give up			0
two is you never are too old to chase your dreams			1
three is it looks like a solitary sport , but it 's a team , " she said			2
the swim was a long - awaited triumph for @entity2 , who was making her fifth attempt since 1978 and her fourth since turning 60			1
the first four tries were marked by gut - wrenching setbacks ; if the rough , strength - sapping seas did n't force her to quit , an hours - long asthma attack or paralyzing and excruciating jellyfish stings did			2
but for this swim , besides donning a suit meant to protect her against her jellyfish nemesis , she wore a special mask to prevent jellyfish stings to her tongue , a key factor in her failed attempt last year			1
@entity2 , who was 29 when she first tried the swim , said last week that she wanted to show that " you can dream at any age			1
" " this time , i am 64			0
so , the years of my life are shorter to the end , " she said at a news conference in @entity13 on friday			0
" so this time i am , all the way across ... going to think about all those life lessons that came up during the swim			2
" fatigue almost seemed poised to derail her again early monday			0
about 7:30 a.m. et , she was slurring her speech because of a swollen tongue and lips , her support team reported on its website			0
as the team called her around dawn for her first feeding since midnight , she took longer than normal to reach the support boat , the report said			0
divers swam ahead of her , collecting jellyfish and moving them out of @entity2 's path			1
swimmer 's challenge : cross 103 miles of shark - infested water when instructed monday morning to follow the path that 's been cleared for her , she flashed her sense of humor , replying , " i 've never been able to follow it in my life , " according to the website			1
' tell me what your dreams are ' @entity2 's home stretch followed an overnight in which she became so cold , the team did n't stop her for feeding until first light " in the hopes that swimming would keep her warm , " the website said			1
every stroke she swam put her deeper into record territory			0
on sunday night , she broke @entity141 's record for the farthest anyone has managed on the trek without a shark cage			1
in 1997 , @entity146 @entity145 completed the swim from within a shark cage			1
she was 22 at the time			0
@entity2 set out from @entity13 at 8:59 a.m. saturday with a crew of 35 , including divers to watch for sharks			1
in her first attempt to cross the @entity16 in 1978 , rough seas left her battered , delirious and less than halfway toward her goal			2
she tried again twice in 2011 , but her efforts ended after an 11 - hour asthma attack and jellyfish stings			1
last year , she abandoned an attempt about halfway through after severe jellyfish stings and a lightning storm put her in danger			2
@entity2 was a swimming sensation before these attempts			1
in the 1970s , she won multiple swimming marathons and was one of the first women to swim around the island of @entity167			2
she was 8 years old when she first dreamed about swimming across the @entity16			0
at the time , @entity2 was in @entity6 on a trip from her home in @entity7 in the 1950s , before @entity171 led a @entity173 takeover in @entity6 and the country 's relations with the @entity170 soured			1
the @entity177 woman had said this was going to be her final attempt			1
" i decided , this one no matter what happened , i do n't want that experience again -- like right now , tonight -- talking to you about the journey is worth everything			0
but i did n't want to be here packing up again , " @entity2 told @entity18 's @entity17			1
she demurred when he described her as a hero but said she hopes she can serve as some sort of inspiration			0
" i think that a lot of people in our country have gotten depressed , pinned in , pinned down with living lives they do n't want , " @entity2 said			1
she continued : " i do write all the time about -- you tell me what your dreams are			0
what are you chasing ? it 's not impossible			0
" 14 - year - old swims solo across @entity205			0

@entity2 sits down with @entity18 chief medical correspondent dr. @entity17
