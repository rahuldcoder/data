-- beneath the streets of @entity3 , behind the locked door of a brick cellar that smells faintly of mold , four tourists are trying their hardest to break out			1
in the room with them are various vehicle parts , a computer and a walkie - talkie , which their captor uses to taunt them as a timer counts down their remaining seconds			0
" you ca n't manage to get out on your own , " says @entity16 , watching the futile efforts of his four captives via video surveillance			0
it may sound like their vacation has gone terribly wrong , but the four have actually paid to be incarcerated and , it seems , they 're enjoying themselves			0
this is the subterranean world of escape games , a craze that 's swept through @entity3			1
the games see participants pit their wits against a series of mental and physical challenges in order to gain their freedom in the quickest time possible -- under the watchful eyes of an all - powerful gamesmaster			1
though escape games are now appearing across @entity41 , @entity3 claims to have pioneered this unlikely new entertainment			1
what it takes to play the city now hosts nearly 100 versions and the activity is listed as a top attraction on @entity49			0
typically , participants find themselves locked in two or three semi-derelict rooms in a @entity3 basement			1
there they must search for keys and clues that will trigger the mechanisms that will free them from the labyrinth			0
" it 's really fun , you get absorbed in the story and forget about the rest , " says @entity59 , from @entity60			2
she 's emerging from one of three separate challenge zones at @entity67 , an escape game hidden beneath @entity69 , one of @entity3 's so called " ruin bars " ( 4 , @entity71 , @entity3 ; +36 30 619 5447 )			1
@entity72 , the domain of gamesmaster 38 - year - old @entity16 , lays claim to creating the phenomenon in 2011			2
" @entity67 is really for everyone , " he says , keeping an eye on a monitor on which his four captives are still trying to solve a mystery based around a driving lesson			1
" kids from 12 or even smaller can already play			0
an intellectual and someone who 's never been to college can perform equally well			2
" @entity16 , who studied team - building strategies at university , says he devised @entity72 as a way of testing group dynamics			2
he says there 's a need to strike a careful balance to engage participants without overly frustrating them			1
" tasks should be neither too easy nor too hard , " he says			0
" first you think it 's impossible to solve the puzzle , but at the end of the day you manage to pick up the elements you 'll need to open the exit door			1
" flirting with the horror genre two months after @entity67 was launched , the former social worker quit his job to focus on his new creation			1
" it looked clear that i would be able to make a living out of escape games , " he says			1
he 's since hired five employees and begun franchises abroad -- a smart move given that he faces stiff competition from rivals			1
@entity3 now offers escape challenges for all tastes , most costing about $ 40 per group of two to six people			1
some , such as @entity117 ( 3 barcsay st. , @entity3 ; +36 20 528 2191 ) flirt with the horror genre			1
others , like @entity121 ( 44 rottenbiller st. , @entity3 ; +36 6 70 7027 517 ) or @entity122 ( 10 - 12 @entity123 , @entity3 ; + 36 30 458 2905 ) take their cues from @entity125			1
in a high - ceilinged cellar just off @entity3 's luxurious @entity127 lies @entity128 ( 20 @entity129 st. , @entity3 ) an escape game that recently topped @entity49 's list of attractions in the @entity134 capital			1
featuring a well designed medieval gallery on one side and an @entity138 pharaoh - themed sliding door challenge on the other , @entity128 welcomes about 200 groups a month -- 90 % of them from abroad			0
its founder , former logistics company owner @entity141 , is also pushing beyond @entity134 's borders with tracks planned in @entity144 and @entity145			2
coming back for more " the phenomenon has its seasonality , but we 're keeping on expanding , " he says			0
escape games seem to be sound investment in @entity3 , where real estate is cheap and low - cost labor is abundant -- not to mention the huge visitor numbers the city attracts			1
@entity141 says his two challenge zones at @entity159 street cost him roughly $ 22,000			2
the investment appears to be paying off			0
" two years ago my mother thought i was absolutely crazy but now she has changed her mind , " he says			0
as he chats , one of @entity128 's challenge doors opens and four @entity165 tourists , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 , emerge from what they say is their second visit			2
" we loved it , " says @entity169			0
" i 'm amazed we did so well ! you have very little time to think ahead who would do what			0
" we 'll definitely come back			0
" back over at @entity67 , @entity16 's four captives are still struggling with their driving test challenge			1
he picks up his walkie - talkie to offer the kind of sage advice you 'd expect from someone responsible for creating what may soon be a global phenomenon			0
" you need to play as a team			2
and use your brain ! you have to be on the lookout for clues			0
" @entity0 's series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries and regions we profile			2
however @entity0 retains full editorial control over all of its reports			0
@entity199 is a photojournalist and travel writer based in @entity3			2
she 's a blogger at @entity201 and the author of several guidebooks on central and eastern @entity41			0
she tweets at @ @entity204 .			0
