" @entity50 , police chief for @entity6 's @entity52 district , told @entity0 the men killed in the video were probably those abducted from his region during a june 1 @entity2 attack on the village of @entity59			1
the attack targeted a security check point near the village			0
thirty police officers were killed , and more than a dozen more were kidnapped in the assault , @entity50 said			1
@entity2 representatives allege in the video that the executions were conducted in retaliation for the execution of six children by government security forces in @entity6 's heavily contested @entity72			1
a spokesman for the @entity6 military denied that any such incident took place , calling the claim " absolutely incorrect			1
" " it 's wrong , and it 's a propaganda tool , " maj. gen. @entity78 said			0

@entity6 military officials have repeatedly denied the allegations			2
the relationship between @entity6 and the @entity111 has been in a downward spiral over disputes about how to pursue counterterrorism efforts , particularly in the wake of the may raid on the @entity6 compound where @entity120 leader @entity144 was killed			2
@entity111 officials did not tell their counterparts in @entity6 about the raid ahead of time			0
