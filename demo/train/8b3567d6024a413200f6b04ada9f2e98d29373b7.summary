-- a @entity2 review released wednesday found no evidence that astronauts flew aircraft or spacecraft while under the influence of alcohol			1
@entity2 found no evidence to back up claims that intoxicated astronauts have been allowed to fly			1
the agency carried out the review after anecdotal evidence emerged of astronauts flying while intoxicated			1
the report , written by @entity16 , chief of @entity2 's @entity17 and himself a former astronaut , was posted on the agency 's web site			1
" within the scope and limitations of this review , i was unable to verify any case in which an astronaut spaceflight crewmember was impaired on launch day , or any case where a manager of a flight surgeon or co-crewmember disregarded their recommendation that a crewmember not fly shuttle or @entity34 , " @entity16 wrote			0
the review was ordered in july after an independent panel commissioned by @entity2 reported two alleged cases in which astronauts were so intoxicated that flight surgeons or fellow astronauts raised concerns over flight safety			1
the astronauts in question were allowed to fly , the panel said			2
the committee was convened by @entity2 to look into the agency 's medical and psychological screening processes after the february arrest of former astronaut @entity50 for the alleged attempted kidnapping of another astronaut 's love interest			2
@entity50 has pleaded not guilty to the charges			0
" interviews with both flight surgeons and astronauts identified some episodes of heavy use of alcohol by astronauts in the immediate preflight period , which has led to flight safety concerns , " the committee 's july report said			2
" alcohol is freely used in crew quarters			0
two specific instances were described where astronauts had been so intoxicated prior to flight that flight surgeons and / or fellow astronauts raised concerns to local on - scene leadership regarding flight safety			2
however , the individuals were still permitted to fly			0
" because the independent committee had promised its witnesses anonymity , committee members were reluctant to divulge sourcing information to @entity16			0
so , @entity16 interviewed about 90 current and former astronauts , flight surgeons , nurses , technicians , managers and staff of the crew quarters			1
he also reviewed records of calls to safety hotlines , submissions to the @entity91 and @entity2 's close call and mishap reporting systems for any evidence pointing to astronaut alcohol abuse			1
he found no evidence of inebriated astronauts , the report said			2
though individuals were able to file reports anonymously , none did so , he said			0
" the lack of privacy on launch day makes it nearly impossible to hide alcohol use or alcohol - induced impairment , " @entity16 wrote			0
" could a crewmember drink to the point of inebriation in his / her room the night before launch ? certainly , but , from the time the crew wakes on launch morning until they lift off , they are surrounded by other astronauts , managers , support crew , television cameramen , still photographers , crew quarters staff and others			0
" the review recommends that @entity2 position a flight surgeon in the suit - up room as astronauts are making their final preparations before departing for the launch pad " to allow more direct contact with the crewmembers on launch day and reduce the reliance on a suit tech ( non-clinician ) picking up any last - minute medical issue			1
