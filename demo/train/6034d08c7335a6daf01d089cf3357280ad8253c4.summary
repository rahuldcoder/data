-- could another deep water -- or even shallow water -- oil drilling disaster be looming ahead ? experts warn it certainly could happen again			1
the @entity7 catastrophe , they say , highlights flaws in the drilling industry 's main defense against oil and gas explosions -- the blowout preventer , which is supposed to shut down an oil and gas well if something goes wrong			1
oil companies have treated such devices as virtually fail - safe			1
" they 're certainly not fail - safe because they did n't close this well			2
if they had been 100 percent fail - safe they would have sealed , they would have closed , " said @entity23 professor @entity22 of the @entity24			2
indeed , there have been numerous rig blowouts , including a large gusher in the @entity31 off the coast of @entity33 last year			2
a growing number of blowouts have caused offshore oil drilling to become sloppier in the past decade			1
there were 72 spills that dumped 18,000 barrels of oil into @entity42 federal waters from 2000 - 2009 , compared to just 15 spills that put 2,000 barrels into the water during the prior decade , according to data compiled by the @entity47 ( @entity47 ) of the @entity48 , which regulates energy exploration			2
( the database excludes spills of less than 50 barrels )			2
avoiding such spills depends upon the reliability of the blowout preventer , which is essentially a faucet on top of the oil well that keeps oil and gas from gushing to the surface			1
rig workers use the preventer to keep a well under control , especially when oil and gas surge or " kick up " from a well			1
when its valves do n't do the job , the blowout preventer can choke off the drilling pipe -- like squeezing a straw while drinking			1
and , if that fails to work , a blowout preventer has yet another line of defense -- huge shear rams -- like giant scissors that are supposed to be able to cut and seal the drilling pipe			1
but , a mile underwater , where the pressure is intense , drill pipes need to be thick , especially the joints between them			2
and those joints are very hard to cut			2
" there are some parts of the pipe that the shears were never meant to cut , " said @entity81 , an expert in petroleum project management who is advising the @entity48 's oil drilling safety review			1
" no one 's equipment will shear the drill collar body			0
that 's a lot of metal			0
it 's not going to be possible to shear certain things , " added @entity93 , another advisor to @entity48 's review of the @entity7 incident and president of @entity97 , which designs and manufactures oilfield and subsea drilling equipment			0
a 2002 study for the @entity47 warned of such trouble in shearing drilling pipe deep underwater			0
initial research painted , " a grim picture of the probability of success when utilizing this final tool in securing a well , " wrote consultant @entity111			0
@entity111 would not comment to @entity0 on its studies for the government			0
" the blowout preventers had a probability of failing to crush that pipe that approaches 50 percent , " said professor @entity115 of the @entity116 who is familiar with the study			1
" it would be like getting on an airplane having a 50 percent chance of making it to your destination , " added @entity122			0
based on 55 years of engineering experience , including a stint as chief offshore engineer for @entity132 , @entity122 is warning government investigators that blowout preventers are not reliable in the deep sea and he worries they could fail in the @entity137 , where the industry is pursuing energy resources			1
" you can keep on pushing equipment to the point of where it breaks , and i think we broke it			0
all of the drilling operations underway of this nature in the world today depend on these devices as the final line of defense			0
" in the harshest of environments , a mile underwater or in the @entity157 , blowout preventers operate under great stress , increasing their potential vulnerability to wear and tear			1
" it is a mechanical piece of equipment			0
it is utilized in harsh environments			0
yes , it can wear out , " said professor @entity164 , chair of the @entity165 at @entity166			0
in fact , @entity168 told congressional investigators there were several leaks in the hydraulic system that was supposed to power the shear rams of the @entity7 's blowout preventer			1
" it was a coupling that had not been tightened down adequately			0
it was several turns loose , " said a person with knowledge of the investigation			0
@entity168 officials also discovered a dead battery			1
the final safety switch for a blowout preventer that has lost communication with its oil rig is the " deadman " system that 's supposed to trigger the blowout preventer to shut the well			1
it did not activate during the @entity193 april 20th rig explosion			0
another study @entity111 prepared for the @entity195 in 2003 found flaw with the deadman system			0
" the most serious drawback to this system ... is the mind set of the rig personnel			0
many operator and contractor personnel refuse to arm the system from fear that it will either not operate when needed or activate inappropriately , causing downtime			0
" such downtime can be extremely costly			0
if the blowout preventer cuts through drilling pipe it can easily cost $ 10 - million to replace that section of pipe and put the rig back into production , said @entity93			1
given the multiple problems with blowout preventers energy experts concede the oil industry must quickly raise its safety bar			1
" we must improve the safety systems of blowout preventers			1
obviously it 's time to take it to the next level , " said @entity93			0
" there are more strenuous conditions occurring and we must have more strenuous solutions for them			2
" the @entity48 , facing the reality of energy drilling dangers , is in the process of toughening rules for offshore oil exploration			2
" we must ensure that offshore drilling is conducted safely and in compliance with the law , " said interior secretary @entity236			0
drilling operations not subject to the administration 's six - month deepwater drilling moratorium have until the end of the month to : -- provide independent third party verification of the safety and effectiveness of blowout preventers ; -- install a secondary control system for subsea blowout preventers ( current regulations do not require such a backup ) ; -- and , adhere to new inspection and reporting requirements for blowout preventers			1
by september the @entity48 intends to require blowout preventers to have two sets of sheer rams spaced at least four feet apart in case a drill pipe joint is in front of a shear during an emergency			1
the @entity48 says such steps will " increase the safety in offshore oil and gas development , " but concedes they , " represent only the beginning of the @entity48 's work			2

blowout preventers are supposed to cut off flow from oil wells
preventer failed on @entity168 well in the @entity275
