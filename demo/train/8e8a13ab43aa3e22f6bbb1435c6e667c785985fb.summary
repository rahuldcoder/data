-- as @entity2 's disaster evolves , so too are the measures taken to mitigate the chaos			0
one such initiative comes from @entity7 military contractor @entity6 , which will help @entity2 's army incorporate robots into their recovery efforts			1
the company joins at least two @entity2 robotics teams on the ground in the quake - and tsunami - ravaged country , one of which operates an 8 - meter - long , snakelike robot with a camera			1
@entity6 , based in @entity20 , @entity21 , is donating four ground - based models to the @entity2 relief effort : two packbots and two warriors			1
the @entity26 is an agile , battle - tested unit that 's been used for bomb dispersal , recon and other tactical operations			1
depending on its configuration , it weighs 45 to 60 pounds and is known for being highly customizable			0
" not every robot works in every situation , " says @entity6 vice president @entity31 , " so they have to be configured appropriately			1
" in @entity2 , the @entity26 will be outfitted with hazmat sensors and deployed in areas of nuclear uncertainty , such as the damaged @entity39 nuclear power plant , to search for chemical , biological or radiological anomalies			1
the larger warrior model is a 347 - pound robot that can traverse rubble or wreckage and carry up to 200 pounds			1
for this mission , it will be configured with firefighting capabilities that allow it to deploy fire hoses or clear away rubble			0
it complements the @entity24 ' agility and scanning capabilities with the muscle to physically neutralize hot zones			0
both the @entity26 and the warrior are remote - controlled from a distance of 800 meters ( about half a mile )			1
the packbot transmits data about hazardous conditions to an operator in real time			0
because @entity2 's relief workers face massive piles of impenetrable rubble , the robots might also play a key role in general search - and - recovery efforts , as the @entity26 did at @entity72 's ground zero in the aftermath of 9/11			1
a dual track system on both units enhances mobility and makes it possible for them to navigate areas humans ca n't safely reach			0
the @entity80 and @entity81 are accompanied by six @entity6 employees who will train @entity2 's @entity83 in their use			2
the units can be operated with an @entity87 or @entity88 controller in a straightforward plug - and - play fashion			2
once in the field , robots that enter nuclear hot zones are n't necessarily expected to make it back out , as contamination could render them unsafe for later			2
but by going where relief teams should n't , they might prevent additional , unnecessary human casualties			0
" this is why we got into robotics , " said @entity6 's trainer			2
" to keep people out of harm 's way			0
