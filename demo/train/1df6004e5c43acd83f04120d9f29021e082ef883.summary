@entity0 -- health care reform moved a major step closer to reality monday when the @entity5 voted before dawn to overcome a @entity8 filibuster against a sweeping $ 871 billion health care bill			1
the procedural vote virtually ensures the bill 's final approval by the chamber later this week			1
it would then be merged with the $ 1 trillion @entity16 version in what would be tough negotiations on president @entity20 's top domestic priority for 2009			1
a final bill requiring approval from both chambers would not be completed until after @entity24 returns in january from its holiday break			2
@entity20 hailed the @entity5 's overnight vote as an important victory for the @entity29 people			1
" by standing up to the special interests who prevented reform for decades and who are furiously lobbying against it now , the @entity5 has moved us closer to reform that makes a tremendous difference for families , for seniors , for businesses , and for the country as a whole , " @entity20 told reporters at the @entity16			2
ireport.com : give your thoughts on the @entity5 health care bill the influential @entity48 , a traditional opponent of health care reform , announced monday it supports the @entity5 bill			1
@entity48 president - elect dr. @entity52 joined senate majority leader @entity53 and other top @entity54 to call for changes that @entity53 said would help provide health care for " all people , not just those who can afford it			1
" the 60 - 40 party line vote -- cast shortly after 1 a.m. -- kept @entity54 on track to pass the bill on @entity62			2
they needed every vote in their 60 - member caucus for the supermajority in the 100 - member chamber needed to overcome the filibuster , and some senators extracted beneficial provisions for their states before agreeing to support the bill			2
@entity8 have mounted a fierce campaign against the bill , using procedural tricks to slow debate and casting the measure as an unnecessary government intrusion into health care that will raise costs			1
@entity20 rejected @entity8 claims that the bill would add to the federal deficit , noting the nonpartisan @entity85 reported the @entity5 plan would reduce the deficit by $ 132 billion over the first 10 years			2
if a combined @entity16 - @entity5 health care bill eventually wins final approval from @entity24 and is signed by @entity20 , it would be the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees since the enactment of @entity94 and @entity95 over four decades ago			1
republicans ripped the @entity98 majority for passing the measure in the middle of the night and accused @entity54 of ramming the bill through despite growing public opposition			0
" make no mistake : if the people who wrote this bill were proud of it , they would n't be forcing this vote in the dead of night , " argued senate minority leader @entity104 , @entity105			2
" @entity113 my words : this legislation will reshape our nation , " he said			0
" and @entity29 have already issued their verdict			0
they do n't want it			0
they do n't like this bill , and they do n't like lawmakers playing games with their health care to secure the votes they need to pass it			1
" read dr. @entity127 's take on the health care bill the unusual timing of the vote was a consequence of @entity5 rules , the determination of @entity54 to pass the bill before adjourning for the holidays , and the @entity8 's willingness to use every possible legislative tactic to slow the bill 's progress			1
two more procedural votes this week also will require @entity54 to win the backing of 60 members to break a @entity8 filibuster			0
final passage of the measure , by contrast , will require a simple majority of 51 votes			1
to democrats , monday 's vote signaled eventual victory on the @entity5 bill			1
" the die is cast			0
it 's done , " @entity155 @entity98 sen. @entity154 proclaimed			0
but compromises made to win the backing of moderate @entity54 , such as sen. @entity159 of @entity160 and sen. @entity161 of @entity162 , enraged many liberal @entity54 and threatened to undermine support for the bill			0
@entity165 are particularly upset with @entity53 's decision to abandon a government - run public health insurance option and an expansion of @entity94 to @entity29 as young as age 55 -- ideas strongly opposed by @entity161 and other centrists			0
@entity173 , however , argue that the @entity5 bill as currently written would still constitute a positive change of historic proportions			0
the legislation , according to the @entity85 , would extend health insurance to more than 30 million @entity29 currently lacking coverage while reducing the federal deficit			0
@entity1 's @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182 contributed to this report			0
