@entity0 -- bipartisanship is in the eye of the beholder , it seems , as @entity5 and @entity6 ponder how cooperation between them can improve after the upcoming congressional elections			1
the voting on november 2 is expected to diminish @entity5 majorities in both chambers and perhaps cost them control of the @entity14			1
whatever the final tally , widespread voter dissatisfaction with the hostile political climate in @entity0 is evident			0
@entity5 blame @entity6 intransigence , calling the @entity6 a " party of no " that has opposed almost every initiative to undermine president @entity23 's campaign pledge to change @entity0 politics			1
@entity6 leaders say their opposition is a response to a left - leaning agenda pushed by @entity23 and @entity5 leaders that far exceeds what the public wants			1
in a new development this election cycle , the conservative @entity33 movement wants to throw out both parties , but its agenda aligns it with republicans in the heated campaigning			1
while @entity23 and some @entity5 and @entity6 say they hope for better relations after the election , they express different views of what that would mean			1
" we 're going to continue to reach out , and we 're going to look for common ground and a way forward to solve the problems facing this country , " @entity14 senior adviser @entity46 said sunday on @entity1 's " @entity48 " program sunday			0
@entity46 predicted @entity5 will keep their majorities in both chambers , but conceded that " republicans will have more seats in @entity57			1
" " we 're hoping with that comes a greater sense of responsibility , " he said			0
@entity6 sen. @entity61 of @entity62 had a different take , telling " @entity65 " that it is up to @entity23 to change , not @entity6			1
" if the president 's going to maintain his ideological stance and try to jam things through to support the left in @entity74 , when we 're still a center - right country , then we 're going to say ' no , ' " @entity61 said , adding that @entity6 will work with @entity23 on issues such as job creation , spending cuts and reducing the national debt			1
" there is , i think , a fatigue on the part of the @entity74 people with the aggressive agenda that , frankly , they do n't agree with , but they have n't been listened to , " @entity61 said			2
" they 've been lectured to , and they 're tired of it			0
they 're going to speak up on november 2nd			0
" @entity61 's @entity6 colleague , sen. @entity87 of @entity88 , agreed on the @entity90 program " @entity91 " that @entity23 and @entity5 leaders " over-reached " in the first two years , which he said rattled the @entity74 people			1
" i do n't think it 's about everybody becoming a @entity6 in the last two years , " @entity87 said of expected @entity6 election victories next month			1
" i do believe it 's a rejection of an agenda that scares people			2
the health care bill , the stimulus package , the financial regulation , all the spending was not what people expected from this president			0
" at the same time , some bipartisanship will occur , @entity87 predicted			0
" there will be a bipartisan effort to extend the @entity112 tax cuts and not let them expire " at the end of the year , @entity87 said			2
as @entity5 candidates in swing states realize voters want middle - ground policies instead of a liberal agenda , more compromise will come , he said			1
" i think we 're going to have some bipartisanship when it comes to replacing the health care bill with a more moderate approach , " @entity87 said			0
" you 'll see some @entity5 and @entity6 working early on to try to moderate things			1
" according to @entity87 , the @entity33 movement has helped refocus the national political debate on a center - right agenda , but added that conservatives should n't get carried away			2
" our @entity33 friends have done us a favor , " @entity87 said			0
" but if we talk about doing away with @entity134 as part of our agenda , then we 're going to lose the public			2
... if you get too far right or too far left , you 're going to lose the @entity74 people			0
" @entity46 and @entity14 press secretary @entity140 outlined an agenda for the second half of @entity23 's presidential term that focuses on the nation 's immediate and long - term economic welfare			1
@entity140 told the @entity147 program " @entity148 " that the president will work on strengthening the economy and trying to ensure its future stability , while continuing to push education reform and making sure that health care and @entity156 reforms are properly implemented			0
@entity23 needs @entity5 and @entity6 to work together to deal with the federal debt , @entity140 said			1
a bipartisan debt commission is scheduled to report a set of proposals in december			0
he made no mention of major issues such as immigration reform and energy reform , which @entity23 pushed strongly in his first two years			2
@entity46 , speaking on @entity1 , said both issues were part of the necessary foundation of reforms for sustainable economic growth in the future			0
" i think that regardless of the outcome of election night that voters are going to want two political parties who may have different ideas but understand they have to come together and work together to solve our problems , " @entity140 later told reporters			0
however , other democrats do n't expect a new spirit of partisanship to emerge			0
" it does n't appear right now that the @entity6 is welcoming moderates any more , " @entity185 sen. @entity184 said of the effect of the @entity33 movement on @entity6 candidates			2
" i think that independent voters need to take a hard look in these elections and realize that what we may be getting to is the kind of gridlock that , frankly , is not something that 's desirable in terms of good policy in this country , " @entity184 said on " @entity65 sunday			0
@entity6 " wo n't even pledge that they 'll quit earmarking , " she said , later adding : " if they wo n't even say they 'll stop earmarking in this kind of spending problem that we 're facing , i just think there 's a lot of politics being played			2

the two parties may have different takes on being bipartisan
@entity6 say @entity23 and @entity5 must ease their liberal agenda
@entity5 *question* if @entity6 are open to any compromise
