this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			0
@entity14 , @entity15 : you 're tuned in to @entity0 , where fridays are always awesome ! hi , everyone			1
let 's get to the headlines			2
first up : lessons to be learned ? @entity14 : first up , political protests turn violent in some of the @entity4 nations we 've been talking about these past few weeks			2
the @entity28 government says it 's " deeply concerned " about the crackdown on anti-government protesters in @entity31			1
yesterday , several people were killed and hundreds more were injured in fighting between protesters and security forces			0
in @entity36 , at least 20 people were hurt when groups that support and oppose that country 's government threw stones at each other yesterday			2
and in @entity42 , some web sites called for a " @entity43 " thursday			0
that could be a sign that anti-government protests are picking up in the country			0
in all of these countries protesters are calling for change			0
that 's already happened in @entity6 , where long - time president @entity51 has stepped down			1
@entity52 explains why @entity6 should study history to see where things might go from here			1
( @entity55 ) @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 : a revolution in @entity7 32 years ago			1
months of bloodshed , protest , but success : the ouster of the @entity64 and his oppressive government			0
three decades later , a similar fight , this time powered by @entity6			1
the sweet taste of victory , forcing a dictator out of office			0
but what 's next ? for @entity7 , more than thirty years later , the battle for freedom still remains			1
@entity74 was 17 years old when he took part in the @entity7 revolution			1
he says the honeymoon was short lived after the @entity64 's regime was over and a repressive @entity80 republic took charge			2
he wants @entity6 to learn from @entity7 's history			1
@entity83 , @entity7 protester : we have @entity7 as a good example of the hopes that people had and what it eventually ended up being			1
so , i 'm just hoping that they do n't have the same outcome and that they should be under watch			0
@entity95 : a big warning for @entity6			1
@entity97 , president , @entity99 : it 's very positive that there 's so much optimism , but it should not be translated into naivety			2
this is where the hard work begins , to ensure that getting rid of a dictatorial system actually translates into achieving democracy			0
and that 's a very , very hard path that the @entity6 will walk			1
but hopefully , they will be more successful than the @entity7 were in 1979			1
@entity95 : for @entity7 like @entity74 , their fight will continue			1
@entity83 : i hope to see a day where i can go and vote freely for someone who i choose			0
i hope to see a day when women and men have the right to just , basically , walk with each other , not be fearful of the repercussions of what 's going to happen			2
and i hope to see , basically , a day when i can go back to my country			0
@entity95 : @entity52 , @entity0 , @entity58 ( @entity122 ) this day in history @entity14 : it 's february 18th , and on this day in history ... in 1861 , @entity125 became the president of the @entity127			1
the @entity127 ended with its loss in the @entity129			0
in 1930 , @entity130 was discovered by an astronomer at an observatory in @entity133			0
it was once thought to be the solar system 's 9th planet , but @entity130 was downgraded in 2006			2
and in 2001 , @entity138 legend @entity137 , " @entity137 , " was killed in a car crash during the last lap of the @entity141			0
stimulus : two years later @entity14 : it did n't happen on this day in history , but two years ago yesterday , president @entity143 signed the @entity146 into law			1
most of us know it better as the stimulus bill			1
this law , which had a final price tag of $ 814 billion , caused a huge controversy			2
it was designed to give the @entity28 economy a jump start , but @entity158 and @entity159 disagreed about whether or not it would work			1
two years later , they still disagree			2
president @entity143 's administration says the stimulus has helped save more than 3 million jobs and kept the country from suffering another depression			1
@entity159 say the stimulus has n't created the kind of recovery that the president promised it would			2
as part of their argument , @entity159 point to the country 's unemployment rate			2
it 's gone down recently , but it 's higher now than when the stimulus bill was signed			1
some experts say it 's hard to judge the success of the stimulus because more than a third of the money from it has n't even been spent yet			1
@entity184 @entity185 , @entity15 : today 's shoutout goes out to mrs. @entity188 's social studies class at @entity190 in @entity191 , @entity192 ! what name was associated with @entity28 laws that enforced racial segregation ? was it : a ) @entity197 , b ) @entity198 , c ) @entity200 or @entity201 ) @entity202 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! @entity198 laws enforced racial segregation between the 1870s and 1950s			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! the @entity210 @entity14 : you might have learned about some of the @entity198 laws in school : whites and blacks had to use separate water fountains , sit in different parts of the bus , go to different schools			2
while these laws were in effect , and even after they were overturned , @entity222 - @entity28 were n't welcome everywhere			1
@entity223 shows us how a special book helped people travel safely around the country			1
( @entity55 ) @entity223 , @entity228 , @entity229 : the pictures on his wall are from 50 years ago , but @entity233 remembers it like yesterday			2
@entity233 was one of the @entity235 9 , a group of @entity238 students who enrolled in @entity239 in the @entity241 capital in 1957			0
while @entity233 was making history in the schools , his family navigated the segregated roads using a little - known guide for @entity222 - @entity238 families			1
@entity233 , @entity248 : the @entity210 was a , i think an institution in black life			0
it was one of those unknown survival tools for black people that had to move around the country			0
i was a teenager , so i knew that the @entity210 was a necessity for us to have a place to stay			0
@entity260 : a place to stay , a place to eat , even a car repair shop that would be friendly to blacks , all pulled together in this directory			0

my aunt and mother mapping out a program for us to travel from @entity235 to @entity271 , @entity272 for my sister 's graduation			1
@entity260 : personal tales like this inspired the playwright , and he learned about the travel guide 's 1936 genesis			1
@entity280 , playwright , author , " @entity283 " : well , @entity284 , an @entity222 - @entity238 gentleman who had traveled himself and had hardships on the road , embarrassment , embarrassing situations that he did n't want to see his people continue to have			1
so he said , " if i can do something about this , i will			0
" @entity260 : the idea took off			0
and year after year , the @entity210 grew , providing resources for all 50 states			0
today , @entity295 takes his children 's book , " @entity301 and the @entity210 , " to elementary schools , bringing old tales to a new audience			1
and in the process , picking up on a dream that the creator of the @entity210 held dearly			0
@entity265 : travel , exposure , knowledge , all of it is fatal to prejudice			1
it requires people to think broader to this idea about universality that begins to see people as people			0
@entity260 : big lessons from the little guide that history almost forgot			0
@entity223 , @entity0 , @entity320			1
( @entity122 ) pictures do n't lie @entity14 : teachers , we have a documentary we think you 'll want to check out			0

that 's 80 pounds of fish , 45 pounds of veggies , four gallons of salsa			0
the stunt is helping promote a new menu item at the cafeteria			0
