@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 warplanes crossed a disputed border region to strike monday in @entity1 , escalating fighting that threatens to return the neighboring @entity8 countries to full - scale war , a witness said			1
a @entity1 military commander , @entity10 , was quoted by @entity12 's website as saying that more than 1,200 @entity1 had been killed			1
a @entity1 military spokesman denied that @entity1 had used military aircraft to bomb the south			1
" we have nothing to do with what 's going on in @entity21 , " he said , implying that militias or @entity1 rebels were behind any fighting			1
the report of the bombing of the towns of @entity25 and @entity26 came days after @entity1 pulled its troops at the request of the @entity29 from the disputed oil - rich region of @entity32 , though @entity1 says its soldiers retook the area from @entity1 soldiers			1
two fighter jets fired four missiles at the neighboring towns , divided by a river , hitting an open - air market and killing at least one person , said journalist @entity42 , who is in @entity25			1
@entity42 was in his car crossing the bridge between the two towns when anti-aircraft fire erupted			1
that was followed , he said , by missile strikes			0
" i saw one boy who about 10 years old who was completely burned , " he said			1
" there are other casualties			0
" the remains of thatch - covered stalls in @entity26 smoldered for hours after the morning bombing , @entity42 said			0
in a statement , @entity1 information minister @entity56 said that three bombs had struck a market in @entity25 , killing two civilians , including a 12 - year - old boy			1
" the @entity62 must take its responsibility and punish the @entity64 for continuing this aerial bombardment and the violation of the airspace of @entity1 , " he said			1
soon after , the @entity29 called for @entity1 to halt the aerial bombings after what it described as four morning attacks , including one on the capital of oil - rich unity state			1
" these indiscriminate bombings resulting in the loss of civilian lives must stop , " said @entity73 , special representative of the secretary - general for @entity1 , in a statement			1
ban ki - moon condemned the bombardment and called on @entity1 to cease all hostilities immediately , a spokesman for the secretary - general said in a statement			1
he called on @entity1 's president @entity85 and @entity1 's president @entity86 " to stop the slide towards further confrontation and urges both sides to return to dialogue as a matter of urgency , " the statement said			1
the @entity29 peacekeeping mission said one of its helicopters was in the air during the 8:30 a.m. attack on @entity25 , the unity state capital			0
" the @entity29 helicopter was in the vicinity at the time of the bombing , and it took off and landed without damage , " said @entity98 , a spokeswoman for the mission			0
in the hours after the airstrikes , the military presence in the area increased , @entity42 said			2
two @entity1 generals who were arriving near the towns said the airstrikes marked " a clear escalation " by @entity1 , he said			1
in addition to the airstrikes , fighting continued monday in several areas of the border region , said @entity1 's military spokesman , @entity116			1
the attacks came a day after @entity1 said the @entity118 had crossed into its territory and attacked two army bases			2
southern troops had withdrawn there after occupying @entity32 for more than a week			0
@entity1 said it was complying with a request from the @entity62 to pull troops out , while @entity1 said it had defeated the southern army and forced it to retreat			2
" there will be no negotiation with the @entity1 , " @entity85 said monday in @entity125 on @entity1 government radio			2
" we have spoken to them now with guns and bullets			0
... we will teach the government of @entity1 a lesson			2
" first vice president @entity135 told parliament that the government will take whatever measures are needed to guarantee stability in @entity1 , state - run media reported monday			2
" @entity142 has given a directive for immediate application of the @entity145 along the border with @entity1 state , " the official @entity141 said			1
" he said that the attempt of @entity1 state to destroy the oil facilities in @entity32 can never cripple the @entity1 people , affirming that the @entity1 people are capable to renew its economic strength , provide resources and doubling its capability for production at all arenas			2
" in a speech last week , @entity85 vowed to overthrow the government to " liberate " @entity1 from the ruling party , the @entity160			2
@entity1 's army spokesman , col. @entity116 , suggested that the ground incursions and aerial bombardment may indicate that @entity85 plans to make good on his threat to invade			2
" there 's a possibility that they 're implementing what @entity85 said , " @entity116 said			0
the @entity169 released images monday that it said confirmed a buildup of military strike aircraft at two air bases			0
" many are in range to fly deep into @entity1 , " said the project , which is led by the @entity175			2
the project analyzed images of air bases at @entity181 , @entity183 state , and @entity184 , @entity185 , and identified 13 fighter jets , eight helicopter gunships and three @entity189 transport aircraft , which the @entity118 uses for bombing			1
@entity116 said monday 's bombings were carried out by @entity193 fighter jets and @entity194			1
@entity1 has accused its northern neighbor of repeatedly crossing its border since sunday to launch ground and aerial attacks			1
claims from either side are difficult to confirm , as journalists and independent observers rarely have access to the front lines			0
on state - run tv , a @entity1 government spokesman said @entity208 would respond to @entity1 's use of force with force of its own			2
the latest attacks came after @entity213 , @entity1 's minister of information , said his country 's army had withdrawn from @entity32 to bases near the border and inside @entity1			1
@entity1 forces crossed the border and attacked them there over the weekend , he said			1
" they are trying to drag us back into a war , and that 's what the @entity62 did n't want , " he said			0
" they must tell them to stop these attacks			0
" @entity56 said bases near the border had been repeatedly attacked by @entity1 troops based in @entity32 and those attacks were what prompted @entity1 to take the area april 10			1
@entity1 split from the government in the north in july , officially breaking @entity8 's largest nation into two , the result of a referendum last year overwhelmingly approved by voters			2
the referendum was part of a 2005 peace deal that ended the civil war that had pitted a government dominated by @entity246 in the north against black @entity248 and animists in the south			0
in the separation , @entity1 acquired three - quarters of @entity1 's oil reserves			0
the two countries have been locked in negotiations about how much the landlocked @entity1 should pay to use a pipeline and processing facilities in the north			0
while both countries claim @entity32 , @entity1 continued administering the region			0
@entity85 had vowed to " never give up " the disputed region			0
@entity1 's oil industry suffered when fighting in @entity32 forced a halt to oil production in those fields , which account for about half of the country 's production of 115,000 barrels a day			1
satellite images suggest that infrastructure in the @entity32 oil fields may have been severely damaged by the fighting			0
the @entity169 released images sunday that suggest a critical part of the oil pipeline infrastructure was destroyed			0
the collection manifold , which separates or combines oil flows without interrupting the overall flow , appears to have been damaged by an explosion			0
each country has accused the other of being behind the destruction			0
@entity1 has accused @entity1 of destroying oil infrastructure and said it would attempt to force @entity1 to pay for damages ; @entity1 has said @entity1 bombed @entity32 field 's central processing facility			0
serious damage to the facility would prevent companies from resuming production and would require substantial investment to repair or rebuild			0
the renewed fighting follows a weekend appeal by @entity293 president @entity292 for the countries to " choose peace " and return to negotiations			0
@entity2 's @entity298 in @entity299 and journalists @entity297 in @entity0 , @entity1 , and @entity300 in @entity208 , @entity1 , contributed to this report .			0
