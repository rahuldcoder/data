@entity21 , @entity22 : fridays are awesome ! thanks for spending part of yours with @entity0 ! from the @entity27 , i 'm your host , @entity26			1
first up : focus on : the economy @entity30 : first up today : technically , recession is n't a four - letter word			1
but it is one that @entity35 do n't like to use , because it describes a downturn in the economy over time			1
why might this happen ? well , many @entity35 ' home mortgages are going up			1
and they 're not able to pay			1
more people are out of work , consumers -- like you and me -- are spending less money overall			1
and we do n't even need to mention gas prices			2
now these factors add up to an economic forecast that 's not so good ; your family may be feeling the pinch			1
and all this is lighting a fire under government officials to fight a possible recession			1
@entity57 considers the options @entity59 has , to try to prevent @entity35 from slipping into the red			2
( @entity61 ) @entity57 , @entity0 reporter : with fears of a recession growing , @entity63 chairman @entity62 was on @entity66 thursday , urging @entity59 to act quickly on an economic stimulus package			1
@entity62 , federal reserve chairman : stimulus that comes too late will not help support economic activity in the near term and it could be actively destabilizing if it comes at a time when growth is already improving			2
@entity74 : the president had a conference call with @entity78 and @entity79 leaders from both parties , the @entity79 characterizing it as a consultation rather than a negotiation			2
all sides are indicating partisan bickering will take a backseat to finding a quick solution			2
today marks the first time the @entity79 has said president @entity88 is backing a stimulus plan , but spokesman @entity90 shied away from discussing specifics			2
: the headwinds that we 're dealing with right now are things that we see over the next coming quarters			2
so we do want to try to pass something quickly			2
@entity74 : house speaker @entity98 and @entity79 minority leader @entity99 met for the second day in a row			2
both sides are stressing a bipartisan effort , but proposals are still vague			2
one option @entity104 and @entity106 seem to agree on : tax rebates : checks sent to taxpayers in an attempt to quickly pump money into the economy			2
@entity104 say they 'll scuttle any @entity106 attempts to extend the president 's tax cuts as part of the stimulus package			2
privately , congressional @entity106 acknowledge it 's a fight they ca n't win			2
what 's more , @entity62 told @entity59 thursday , making the tax cuts permanent wo n't help in the short term			2
@entity62 : i think that the evidence suggests that measures that involve putting money in the hands of households and firms that will spend it in the near term will be more effective			2
@entity74 : speaker @entity98 is hoping to have a final agreement before the @entity132 on january 28th			2
@entity57 , @entity0 , the @entity79			2
( @entity133 ) no girls allowed @entity30 : the next question today is , are girls as good as boys at sports ? and if they are , should they be allowed to play at the organized , school level ? swing by @entity141 , @entity6 , and you 'll find that very controversy rounding the bases			1
but it 's not over a school rule -- it 's a state one			1
@entity148 of affiliate @entity149 steps up to the plate			2
( @entity61 ) @entity151 , wants to play baseball : i can play as well as a boy			1
@entity156 , @entity149 reporter : twelve - year - old @entity157 is passionate about baseball @entity159 : i just love the sport			1
@entity161 : she lives by the motto , " practice makes perfect			2
" @entity159 : i 'm gon na try harder			2
@entity161 : she spends hours here in the batting cage and working with coaches on her curveball			0
but this week , @entity157 went to try out for the middle school baseball team at the @entity173 and was told she could n't play			1
@entity159 : i 'm a girl			0
so what ? you 're not supposed to discriminate against females if they want to try to do something new , and try to make history at their own school			0
@entity161 : the school 's headmaster says they have no problem with her playing with the boys , but that she is n't allowed by the @entity184			0
@entity185 , @entity186 : since we have a softball team , the state has indicated to us that she would not be permitted to play baseball			1
@entity161 : the most obvious difference between softball and baseball -- it 's the ball			1
the softball and the baseball			1
but @entity157 says there 's much more to it than that			0
@entity159 : the pitching is different			0
in softball they have longer bats -- different gear			0
@entity161 : @entity157 is n't alone in her baseball dreams			1
her parents are considering taking legal action in hopes of changing the rules			0
@entity209 's mother : if she wants to pursue baseball , then we 'll pursue baseball			1
i just want to give her a chance			0
you know , give her a chance to try out , to see if she 's good enough to make any team			0
@entity161 : @entity157 is a humble , yet confident 7th grader			0
@entity159 : i was going to give them something to show , instead of wearing pretty jewelry and short skirts			0
@entity161 : she believes she is good enough to play with the boys			0
@entity159 : there 's really no difference - girls an play just as good as boys			0
( @entity133 ) promo @entity30 : standing up for what she believes in ; got ta give her props for that			0
another famous @entity35 who stood up to create change : doctor @entity238			0
@entity239 will air ' the @entity240 that changed a nation			0
' it 's on at 4 am monday morning			0
be sure to set your @entity243 's now			0
for special curriculum on the program , check out @entity247			0
@entity248 @entity249 , @entity22 : today 's @entity248 goes out to mrs. @entity251 ' geography classes at @entity252 in @entity253 , @entity254 ! who wrote the lyrics to " @entity257 " ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! was it : a ) @entity265 , b ) @entity263 , c ) @entity267 or @entity268 ) @entity269 ? you 've got three seconds , go ! @entity269 wrote the words to the @entity35 national anthem , the @entity257 , after witnessing a battle during the @entity273			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! song for @entity10 @entity30 : for many of us , it 's hard to say , " @entity257 " without singing it -- the words and music are sort - of glued together			0
in @entity10 , there 's just a tune to hum. and though one @entity286 recently got really close to putting official words to it			0
@entity289 explains why many people there , did n't like the way they sounded			0
( @entity61 ) @entity293 , @entity0 reporter : the @entity294 proudly sing their national anthem , the @entity35 croon to theirs			1
and then , there 's @entity10			0
the @entity300 anthem does n't have any words			1
this man won a nationwide contest with his lyrics for the anthem			1
but then suddenly the @entity306 , which sponsored the contest , withdrew the winning entry			0
@entity308 , @entity306 : once @entity300 heard these lyrics , they sparked a lot of controversy , even rejection			1
@entity314 : @entity315 , or @entity10 , is how the now - discarded lyrics began			1
the phrase struck a sour note			0
critics say it harkened back to the long right - winged dictatorship of @entity322			0
@entity324 - @entity323 , journalist : you have to understand that many @entity300 do not consider the national anthem as their own			1
it was played a lot under @entity322			0
@entity314 : @entity10 is now a democracy , but many still bristle at the military march that 's served for more than two centuries as the national anthem			1
@entity10 is made up of many different peoples , and five languages are spoken across the country			0
so , naturally , getting agreement on one set of lyrics is no easy task			1
one of those languages , ancient @entity342 , is among those taught in @entity344 : basques have their own national anthem and lyrics			1
at the @entity349 we found a spaniard who liked the proposed lyrics for the @entity300 national anthem			1
they 're good , he says , and very neutral about @entity10			0
many others say the proposed lyrics lacked polish and shine			1
@entity359 , @entity360 ( @entity361 ) : the @entity363 and @entity35 anthems speak about an enemy to defeat ; our lyrics mentioned fields , wheat and friends			1
@entity370 , @entity371 ( @entity361 ) : the anthem should give us goose bumps			1
@entity10 's long history and diverse culture should show , in the lyrics			1
@entity314 : the @entity306 says the search will go on , but in @entity380 , @entity300 athletes will likely have to just hum along to a wordless anthem , as they 've done for years			1
it 's a tune almost every @entity286 knows			0
@entity289 , @entity0 , @entity344			0
( @entity133 ) before we go @entity30 : before we go , smaller cell phones : cool			0
smaller mp3 players : cool			0
smaller bridges ? you 're not gon na get too much traffic across this @entity389			0
it 's pictured next to a toothpick because it 's made from one ! check that out -- you can even see the lines on the hand holding it ! this thing was carved , with a great deal more precision than i 've got , from a single toothpick and glue			0
the footage sent in to us by @entity405			0
the guy who did this says he 's been a toothpick artist for 36 years ! goodbye @entity30 : and as you could see , he really knows how to ' pick ' his subjects			0
that 's just painful ! and that 's where we conclude our week 's last broadcast			0
we 'll return on tuesday , next week			0
enjoy your three - day weekend , everyone ! i 'm @entity26			0
