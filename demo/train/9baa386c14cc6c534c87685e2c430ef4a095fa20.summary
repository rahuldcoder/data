-- on sunday , a mystery photograph fluttered from the sky and landed near @entity4 's mailbox in @entity5 , @entity6			1
she soon discovered it had been blown from @entity9 , @entity6 , some 90 miles away			1
more random items would rain from the heavens across eastern @entity6 a day later , when the tornado that ripped through @entity9 was followed by a bigger one in nearby @entity14			1
school pictures , personal letters , valentines and baseball cards -- all have been found in recent days many miles from their owners ' homes			1
the items were sucked into the sky by the 200 - mph winds that killed at least 24 people and left a path of destruction in their wake , then blown east across the @entity6 plains by middle - and upper - atmospheric winds			1
help tornado victims claim lost photos @entity4 said some items have been reported found as far as 250 miles away from where the tornadoes struck			1
now , she and others are using @entity36 to try to help victims of the deadly storms get at least some small pieces of their lives back			2
on sunday , she created a @entity36 group called " may 19th 2013 ok @entity42			2
" but when @entity14 was hit the next day , the group was soon overwhelmed , picking up more than 11,000 members			1
she and others have now made a public page , @entity47 , where anyone can post or tag images and share them on their own pages			1
theirs is one of several pages on @entity36 where people are being asked to share photos of items they have found , along with contact information , for anyone who may be able to identify them			1
see some of the images of items found after the tornadoes " first , thank you all for the overwhelmingly generous response to our group , " @entity4 wrote wednesday			1
" the photos and documents are being posted , people are finding cherished treasures they have lost and we could n't be more elated			2
" @entity4 did not immediately respond to a message sent by @entity0 to her @entity36 page wednesday			0
but she told @entity75 the page is her small way of trying to boost recovery efforts in @entity9 and @entity14			1
" i 'm just trying to help , " she said			0
" i could n't imagine losing my kids ' pictures			0
" most of the items posted to the page are photographs : a @entity86 football game , prom pictures , kids playing and families posing at places like @entity91			2
but there are other personal belongings , too , from a teddy bear to a letterman 's jacket to a pink birth - notice card from a hospital with the words " i 'm a girl " printed on top			0
dozens of items had already been claimed by early this week , as residents began taking their first faltering steps toward recovery			2
" this is a photo of my sister 's husband 's dad , " a woman wrote beneath a photo dated 1967			0
" both ( men ) are now deceased			0
she lost her home in the @entity9 tornado			2
i will try to contact ( her ) via @entity36			0
@entity116 bless you for posting ! " the effort is similar to another on @entity36 after 2011 storms that ripped through @entity121 and other @entity123 states			0
" i just started saying , ' there are parts of people 's lives falling out of the sky , ' " @entity129 , that group 's creator , told @entity0 at the time			0
" you just know these are prized possessions to people			0
if they 've lost everything and could just get one picture back , i know that would mean a lot to me			0
" @entity4 is reminding anyone who posts to the page to remember not to show @entity142 numbers , phone numbers or other personally identifying information .			0
