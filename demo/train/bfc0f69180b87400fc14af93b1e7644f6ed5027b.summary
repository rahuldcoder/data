@entity2 two men exchange rings and hug in celebration aboard a @entity7 boat , as ululations fill the air and a traditional engagement song plays in the background			0
but within days , their celebration has turned to shock and sadness : after a video of the " gay wedding " spread across @entity20 social media , the men were arrested and eventually sentenced to three years in prison for distributing pornographic material			1
homosexuality is not mentioned in the @entity20 penal code , and technically it is not illegal , but members of the @entity28 community are often arrested and charged with pornography , prostitution or debauchery			1
at least 20 homosexual and transgender persons were convicted of debauchery and other charges in 2014 , which human rights activists say has been the worst year for the community in recent memory			1
fear of arrest and social stigma force the majority of the lgbt community to conceal their identity and sexual orientation			1
" you have to be aware of everything you 're doing ; your clothes , your reactions toward people , " @entity50 told @entity3			0
he has asked us not to use his real name to protect his identity			0
both dominant religions in @entity20 , @entity57 and @entity58 , prohibit homosexuality			1
rather than the literal translation , the word usually used for homosexuality in @entity62 is " shezoz " , meaning " abnormality			2
" this category is wide enough to lump together homosexuals and transgender people as one , in both media reports and court cases			2
a video posted on a popular news portal last may showed five people after their arrest at a residential apartment ; their faces , like their bodies , barely covered			2
two weeks later , they were sentenced to 12 , seven and four years in prison			0
among the charges they faced was that of using the internet to spread debauchery			0
" the police would make the defendants go through their contacts and the pictures they post on [ dating apps and social media ] to use them as evidence against them and get information on others , " says @entity85 , gender and women 's rights officer at the @entity88			1
earlier this year , a group of rights activists reached out to gay dating websites urging them to issue safety warnings to their @entity20 users			1
@entity104 , a gay dating application , warned their @entity20 users that " police may be posing as @entity28 on social media to entrap you			1
" in september , @entity104 announced that locations would be hidden by default for users in countries such as @entity20 , @entity112 and @entity113 , which have a history of prosecuting those from the lgbt community			1
" i 'm always afraid if i meet someone and he is from the government then i 'll get arrested like other people , " @entity50 said			2
such fears encompass both the humiliation of having one 's identity revealed , and the prospect of coming face - to - face with an unclear judicial procedure			0
the verdicts in such court cases , @entity127 said , were often illogical			0
" take the [ wedding ] case for example : the judge cleared them of the debauchery charges , yet he sentenced them to three years for filming and distributing pornographic material , even though he ruled that there was no debauchery involved			0
" a forensic report from the court found that the men had n't engaged in homosexual intercourse			0
" i think the police will not treat them as humans			0
this is a very big problem in @entity20 , " said psychiatrist dr. @entity147			1
he says he supports gay rights , but he also has another view : " my thought about this is that this is something that can be changed , can be corrected , " says @entity147			1
" of course there are those who can not be cured but we have had many successes with the treatment			0
" that view is widely discredited by leading physiological experts in the @entity161			0
in 2009 , the @entity162 ( @entity162 ) recommended that specialists avoid telling clients that sexual orientation is changeable through therapy or other forms of treatment			1
it warned of " the potential for harm , " stressing the lack of proof that such types of therapy can lead to a permanent change in sexual orientation			1
the @entity162 called into question @entity147 's practices			0
" contrary to claims of sexual orientation change advocates and practitioners , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions to change sexual orientation , " said @entity178 , chair of the task force that created the @entity162 report			1
@entity147 claims those expert findings are the result of pressure from the @entity28 lobby			1
but @entity50 said such " change " attempts were nonsense			0
" my father took me to a psychiatrist once and he gave me this medical thing that actually makes you stop having any sexual feelings but does n't cure you			2
know what i mean ? so it 's bulls * * *			0
" in the majority of @entity20 's film productions over the decades , homosexuals are stereotypically portrayed as overtly flamboyant and part of criminal or prostitution rings			1
" @entity210 " , a film released earlier this year , was ground - breaking in having a gay protagonist			2
the film faced problems with the censors and was criticized when it began showing in @entity20 cinemas			2
the stigma and lack of recognition even extends into the human rights sphere , one activist told @entity3 , explaining that some safety guidelines and advocacy work are done anonymously , not only due to social rejection but also because of a largely unwelcoming community			1
" what needs to happen is there needs to be an official voice for gay people in @entity20 , " @entity225 -- not his real name -- told @entity3			1
in private , more homosexual men and women are coming out to their families in @entity20 to varying reactions , @entity50 said			2
but in the public sphere , the situation is more precarious			0
@entity28 activists say they find their work more difficult than their human rights counterparts in other fields , who are already bracing for a potential government crackdown on civil society , particularly organizations working on human rights			1
the activists themselves run a " double risk " both because of their choice of field and by exposing their identity as members of the @entity28 community , says @entity127			1
the " solidarity with @entity20 lgbt " campaign was launched earlier this year , but an online petition against the imprisonment of homosexuals in @entity20 received just 216 signatures in six months			1
@entity225 would like to see an organization , recognized by the government , to advocate on the behalf of the @entity28 community			1
he believes this would greatly improve their situation			0
but with the @entity267 endowment -- an influential government agency -- condemning homosexuality , many see little prospect for change			2
" there is no room for dialogue , that is my problem with @entity20			2
it is like , i want you to ask me about it and i will tell you and maybe you 'll understand , " he says			0
until that time comes , @entity20 's gays and lesbians will remain in the shadows			2
" hypothetically , there could be an uprising			0
but the whole country would back the mass killings of homosexuals ; the whole country would sweep it under the rug , they would be behind the violence , that 's the problem , " @entity225 said			0
" you ca n't fight the government when you do n't have anything to fight the government with			0
