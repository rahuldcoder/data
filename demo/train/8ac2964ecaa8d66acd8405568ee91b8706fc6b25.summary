@entity0 -- a top @entity4 diplomat will travel to three nations around @entity6 early next year in the first such talks since longtime leader @entity9 's death , the @entity2 announced thursday			1
assistant secretary for @entity18 and @entity19 affairs @entity16 will " discuss a range of important bilateral , regional and global issues " during his four days in @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , the @entity2 said			1
the statement specifically mentions that the " latest developments related to @entity6 , " as well as @entity23 , will be on the agenda			0
@entity23 , also known as @entity23 , has seen rapid political change -- including the legalization of famed dissident @entity27 's political party -- since the election of a new president in march			0
the announcement about @entity16 's trip came the same day that @entity4 defense secretary @entity32 talked by phone with his @entity14 counterpart , @entity34			1
during the roughly 20 - minute call , the pair discussed the situation in the @entity40 and stressed that maintaining peace and security were their top priorities , @entity36 spokesman @entity35 said			0
this all comes on the heels of the death of communist @entity6 's leader on december 17			1
huge crowds gathered thursday in @entity50 for a state - orchestrated memorial service a day after his funeral			0
during that ceremony , @entity54 -- the president of @entity6 's parliament -- declared that @entity63 " is the supreme leader who has inherited ( his father 's ) beliefs , leadership , courage and guts			2
" @entity16 's trip begins tuesday in @entity64			0
the @entity4 diplomat then will head to the @entity14 capital of @entity66 for the following two days , before wrapping up january 7 in @entity67			1
under @entity9 , @entity6 suffered a devastating famine , even as it built up its million - strong army , expanded its arsenal of ballistic missiles and became the world 's eighth declared nuclear power			1
@entity50 's policies and rhetoric often put it at odds with the @entity4 and its ally , @entity14			1
@entity0 does not have formal diplomatic relations with @entity50 , though it has had communications with the reclusive nation , such as through the so - called six - party talks			0
in october , @entity4 officials held a " positive " meeting with a @entity6 delegation in an effort to restart these long - stalled discussions over ending @entity50 's nuclear program , @entity4 ambassador @entity83 said at the time			1
@entity6 technically remains at war with the @entity14 more than five decades after their 1950 - 1953 conflict , after which an armistice was signed between the two nations			2
there was never a formal peace treaty			0
that uncertainty has left the peninsula split by the world 's most heavily fortified border			0
adding to the insecurity are questions about @entity63 , who remains largely an unknown quantity outside his own country			0
a delegation of 18 @entity14 citizens returned tuesday from a two - day visit to the north to pay their respects to the fallen leader and meet with his successor , @entity111			2
@entity66 has expressed its sympathy to the @entity6 people and gave the green light for the visit by the civilian group -- which includes @entity118 chairwoman @entity117 and the widow of former @entity14 president @entity120			1
a day earlier , @entity15 prime minister @entity121 met with @entity13 president @entity122 in @entity64			2
