-- @entity3 , @entity4 said , " thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow @entity2			1
" today , it 's not only socially acceptable to attack your conservative peers , but it has actually become part of campaign strategy			2
identify someone who represents a minority view within the @entity2 , tear him or her to shreds and hope that it establishes you as a voice of the mainstream			2
it 's all very survival of the fittest , very @entity19			0
but is gov. @entity20 of @entity21 really fitter than sen. @entity22 of @entity23 ? certainly not intellectually			1
on friday , @entity20 wrote an op - ed for the @entity25 attacking the " isolationism " of @entity22 and the libertarian right			1
he argued it overlooks the specific threat posed by @entity30 in @entity31 , a group that is " well - trained , technologically sophisticated and adept at recruitment , with thousands of people with @entity35 passports fighting on its side , as well as some @entity38			0
" more generally , @entity20 stated that an isolationist stance is naive about national security and quoted @entity41 to prove it			1
he concluded that not only is @entity22 no @entity4 but , even worse , his approach to foreign policy is reminiscent of president @entity45 's			1
of course , all of this is nonsense			0
@entity20 vs. @entity22 : round two as @entity22 wrote for @entity49 on monday in reply , he is not an isolationist			1
he is an anti-interventionist of a nuanced variety , one who has floated the possibility of using airstrikes against @entity30			0
the comparison with @entity45 is inappropriate because @entity22 is not in favor of constantly setting red lines that he later forgets exist when it becomes potentially painful to enforce them			1
also , @entity22 's foreign policy is practically defined by opposition to @entity45 's big government , security - state operation , so drawing similarities between the two is bizarre			1
finally , it is very strange that @entity20 cites @entity4 as an exemplar of interventionism without giving any example of him intervening			1
at best , there was @entity74 in 1983 -- a brief invasion of a @entity77 island where the opposition was a handful of local @entity80 ( " a lovely little war , " one correspondent called it )			0
at worst , there was the @entity85 , arms - for - hostages scandal ( illegal in most people 's opinion )			0
or @entity88 , where a deadly terrorist attack on a @entity91 barracks eventually led to the withdrawal of @entity38 troops from the country			0
on the whole , @entity4 was in favor of political confrontation with superpowers or wars by proxy but rarely had the stomach for putting @entity38 boots on the ground			2
his instinctive caution was far closer to @entity22 's than @entity20 's " remember the @entity106 ! " nationalism			1
but @entity20 's attack on @entity22 is obviously tactical			1
he has noticed that a lot of hawkish @entity2 are furious with @entity22 , so he has decided to leverage himself some media attention and political support by going on the offensive			1
the strategy is as transparent as the lenses in his new glasses -- presumably a pr guy 's bright idea that they might erode memories of him forgetting his lines in the 2012 @entity2 primaries and convince people that he 's smarter than they first thought			2
alas , although he now looks like @entity122 , we 've yet to see any evidence that he 'll turn into @entity124			0
the debate between these two men is distracting because one senses that neither will be their party 's nominee in 2016			0
@entity20 because , whatever his accomplishments as a governor , he comes across on the national stage as shallow			0
@entity22 because he is too philosophical and can be too easily labeled a maverick libertarian			0
this is a pity because there 's actually plenty of evidence that @entity22 's libertarianism is far more complex than his father 's , as demonstrated by his emergence as a cheerleader for @entity141			2
nevertheless , he faces months to come of responding to attacks like these			0
all of which suggests that the @entity2 are in danger of forgetting who their real enemy is : the @entity149			0
fascinating though these intellectual back - and - forths are , they contribute to the impression that the @entity2 are cracking up as they obsessively strive for an official conservative ideological purity that they will never actually discover -- because it does n't exist			2
conservatism is traditionally about a spirit or an approach to governing , not a list of commandments that must be defined every four years in an internal party spat that has all the ferocity and counting of angels on a pinhead of a religious war			0
@entity20 may believe he is helping himself with this assault on @entity22 , but is he helping the @entity2 ? someone should remind him of @entity4 's advice on how to treat fellow republicans .			1

@entity171 : @entity20 , @entity22 spar in op - eds , break @entity4 's no - attack rule
he says @entity20 off - base in attack on @entity22 as isolationist with a foreign policy like @entity45 's
@entity171 : @entity20 touts @entity4 's approach , but @entity4 tended to avoid confrontation
@entity171 : @entity22 , @entity20 not likely @entity2 's 2016 candidate ; dust - up only makes @entity2 look *fractured*
