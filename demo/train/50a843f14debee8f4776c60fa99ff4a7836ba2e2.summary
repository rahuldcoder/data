-- @entity2 advocates are touting the company 's initial public offering this week -- the biggest ever for an internet company -- as if it will save the net , the economy and the @entity9 way			1
its detractors see the final chapter in the rise and fall of a smart but solipsistic @entity14 dropout , and predict the inevitable decline of @entity2 's stock will spell the end to innovation in social media			1
of course , none of this is true			0
such hyperbole is more about our traditional media 's need for simple stories than anything happening at @entity2 or on @entity29			1
these are the judgments of financial analysts who do n't even know what @entity33 stands for ( application program interface ) , and technology analysts who never heard of the @entity37 ( the provision for an underwriter to oversell )			0
this factless speculation , combined with the risk - off jitters of the greater markets , has led to the conflation of stock value with business , and one social media company with the future of the net			1
if the dot.com bubble and more recent stock market crash should have taught us anything , it 's that stock prices have been uncoupled from business profitability , which has in turn been uncoupled from value creation			0
@entity2 can still be one of the most successful and significant companies of the past 100 years without being nearly worth an ipo valuation of $ 100 billion			1
meanwhile , traders buying stock at that valuation can still make billions more over the next hours or days , even if the stock then plummets or slowly peters out			0
likewise , @entity2 can shoot to a sustained stock market success even without showing a reasonable profit for many years			1
finally , @entity2 can become the biggest stock market and business loser since @entity68 ( who ? ) without taking the @entity70 or social media down with it			1
so to start , let 's look at the ipo in isolation			0
is @entity2 worth the $ 96 billion reportedly implied by ipo valuation ? not at the moment			1
@entity2 's profits are down since last year , its membership growth is stagnating and the online advertising market is softening			1
this ipo comes at a later than ideal time , as the potential trajectory for the company no longer seems infinite			0
does that mean you should n't buy the stock on opening day ? of course not			0
the price of @entity2 shares will have nothing to do with the reality on the ground ( or online )			2
everyone wants in , demand is outstripping supply , and the hunger for shares could push the price very high in the short term			0
none of this has anything to do with social media , it 's just gambling			2
it 's also possible that even the craziest speculators are still undervaluing @entity2 's ultimate worth			1
that 's where a media theorist like me can venture an opinion -- and i 'd have to say no , they 're not			2
@entity2 is certainly the best of the social media apps to come along , just as @entity115 was the best search engine			1
similarly , however , the social media playpen constituted by @entity2 is temporary			1
just as we are moving away from web search into a world of applications running on smartphones , we will move away from our single web - based social media platform toward more ad - hoc social apps on our handheld devices			2
it 's hard for us to imagine right now , but we wo n't be logging into @entity2 to find out what 's going on ; we 'll work and play in an ecology of apps that tell us where people are and what they are doing			1
yes , @entity2 may have a role in that next - generation social media universe , but it will need what tech industry people like to call " a second act			1
" @entity138 's second act is the @entity139			0
@entity115 is hoping for " augmented reality " eyeglasses and network - controlled automobiles			0
are you living without @entity2 ? @entity2 's second act is far from clear			1
it wants to become the platform on which everybody else builds social media apps			0
but if all this activity is happening on smartphones , then @entity2 is dangerously dependent on @entity151 and @entity139 for everything , a layer on top of @entity138 and @entity115 's systems			2
@entity2 's inability to generate income on the smartphone has led to some desperate moves , such as its billion - dollar acquisition of photo - sharing app @entity161 and off - putting products like " sponsored stories			1
" so far , love him or hate him , @entity2 creator @entity165 has been consistent with his vision of building a more social web : a peer - to - peer communications infrastructure that changes the way people connect , share ideas and sell things			1
the more comingled his mission becomes with the priorities of @entity29 , the less freedom he will have to challenge the status quo			2
the @entity178 itself , for instance , is being conducted in the most traditional fashion possible , with underwriters establishing a price and offering shares through brokerage houses			0
compare this to @entity115 , who let the public establish the share price through open bidding , mirroring the company 's revolutionary , bottom - up search algorithm , and challenging underwriters with net democracy			2
the most radical thing @entity165 has done so far is attend investor meetings in a hoodie -- as if to say , " in your face			0
" @entity199 , but it hardly asserts innovation in the face of profiteering , or social networking in the face of the corporate capitalism			0
this is a week when the stock markets are particularly vulnerable to a new message			0
the ceo of @entity211 is resigning after a controversy over resume padding , while executives at @entity215 are falling on their swords for losing so much money , so quickly , that they may change the regulatory landscape for their entire industry			0
people are ready to embrace a new way of playing this tired game			0
by jumping headfirst into the stock market , @entity2 may be joining a zero - sum shell game at just the wrong " risk off " moment			2
if @entity2 does succeed in the stock market this week , then it will do so at the expense of @entity228 , @entity138 and @entity115 , whose net - fetishizing investors will likely be selling those shares in order to buy the new ones from @entity2			2
worse , by joining in the speculative economy on @entity29 's terms , a company that might have changed business instead subjects itself to forces far beyond its control			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity242			0

@entity242 : speculation over the meaning , value of @entity178 is *overblown*
he says valuation of company likely too high , timing not great , but people want in anyway
he says *current* @entity2 will be *overtaken* by next - generation media ; it must innovate
@entity242 : by accepting @entity29 's terms @entity2 may *sacrifice* innovation to profit
