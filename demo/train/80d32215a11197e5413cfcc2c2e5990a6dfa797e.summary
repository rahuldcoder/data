@entity1 , @entity0 -- at one time in the @entity4 at @entity5 in @entity1 , we had two liquid nitrogen containers , one labeled p , the other @entity8 these containers were used to store batches of stem cells			1
the @entity7 , or presidential container , held some of the 21 embryonic stem cell lines that researchers could study using federal funds under the terms of president @entity19 's august 2001 executive order			1
the @entity8 , or nonpresidential , container held those embryonic stem cells derived from later lines , which researchers could not study using federal funding			1
we were required to purchase and store separately the pipettes and culture dishes , duplicating effort and costs			0
the separation included detailed record keeping , and i hired a grant manager to deal with these issues			0
from a logistical standpoint this was a nightmare			0
we offered courses on how to proceed in the lab while monitoring the funding source			0
this separation greatly inhibited progress in the study of many diseases , from blood diseases such as sickle cell anemia to @entity44 's to juvenile diabetes , and the development of potential therapies			0
fast forward to march 2009 , when president @entity48 lifted the ban on using federal funds to study stem cell lines developed after the @entity19 order went into effect			2
scientists were freed to work collaboratively within labs , across labs and across continents			0
single studies could now evaluate more embryonic stem cells and use different types of stem cells -- not only embryonic , but the newer induced pluripotent stem , or @entity64 , cells			1
but now stem cell research -- a promising avenue in biomedical research for curing a host of deadly and debilitating diseases -- has been dealt an enormous setback by a @entity74 @entity73 's injunction against the @entity48 executive order			1
in ruling that federal monies can not be used for any research involving embryonic stem cells , judge @entity77 's decision creates significant uncertainty in the field			1
a stay was ordered this week , rescuing the funding of the research for a short time until the case is heard			2
the fact that research can be shut down and then started again in a matter of weeks has created confusion for proceeding with the work			2
with judge @entity77 's decision , @entity74 scientists have been put at a disadvantage against their counterparts all over the world			2
the @entity74 is in danger of being surpassed as the leader in biomedical research by several countries , including @entity103 , @entity104 , and @entity105			1
the loss of research competitiveness undermines our biotech and pharmaceutical companies ' ability to bring new therapies to patients			0
judge @entity77 's decision places @entity74 researchers in a difficult position			2
promising avenues of research will need to be halted			2
@entity119 grant decisions on major diseases were halted this month , even for studies including a small number of experiments on embryonic stem cells , and millions of dollars that have been committed to stem cell researchers is at risk			1
the economic impact of this injunction on the @entity74 could surely be huge			0
scientists run increased risks of running afoul of the law and will be increasingly isolated from their colleagues overseas			0
while many will seek private and foundational funding for their research , this also comes with a price			0
before the @entity48 order , many elite researchers were spending up to 20 percent of their time on fundraising			0
we risk that the @entity74 will fall increasingly behind			0
this decision is driven both by ideology as well as continuing confusion over the science of stem cells			1
eighty percent of @entity74 are in favor of stem cell research , and @entity151 has twice passed a bill in favor of stem cell research			1
more education is necessary so that everyone understands these cells			0
at @entity5 , we have created a website that provides basic information about stem cells , their biology and potential for therapies			1
despite the plaintiff 's allegations and the judge 's apparent concurrence , it makes no sense from either a research or therapeutic standpoint to pit adult stem cell against embryonic stem cell research			1
think about the chaos that would be created if a heart researcher could file an injunction saying they were harmed and poorly funded because they are in competition with diabetes research			0
giving artificial and unmerited research preference to one type of organs or cells over another would completely undermine the federal peer review process and funding strategy , and more important , would absolutely constrain ongoing searches for treatments and therapies			2
as a hematologist , i have used adult blood stem cells from bone marrow to treat patients with leukemia			1
i can not think that any scientist or patient would view blood stem cell research as " in competition " with embryonic stem cell research			1
embryonic stem cells were the essential key to discovering how to reprogram adult skin cells , and the ultimate therapeutic success of these new reprogrammed cells absolutely will require additional embryonic stem cell research			1
unlocking the potential of stem cells to cure disease requires comparisons of both adult and embryonic tissues			1
these are not two warring sciences ; they are both integral parts of the single field of stem cell research			0
as the founding president of the @entity220 , i know that the most respected scientists and researchers who work on adult and embryonic tissues are working together			2
the position of embryonic stem cell and reprogrammed stem cell research now is similar to where we were in the mid- 1970s with bone marrow transplantation			1
in 1975 , the science was still relatively young and no transplants had yet taken place			0
but over the next decade , bone marrow transplants moved from unknown and experimental to widely accepted and standard therapy			0
in issuing an injunction against president @entity48 's order , judge @entity77 cited the potential harm to federal funding of adult stem cell research from the federal support of embryonic stem cell research			1
the irony is that this decision is a blow to all research , and with it to @entity74 's economic competitiveness and to the hopes of countless families for a cure			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity254 .			0

federal judge halted federal funding for research using embryonic stem cells
@entity254 : adult stem cells not *perfected* , work in combo with embryonic cells
@entity254 warns @entity74 risks being overtaken by many countries in biomedical research
ideology , confusion behind ruling , he writes , 80 percent of @entity74 support research
