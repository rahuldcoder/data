-- @entity1 may put on a show when it skims through the sun 's atmosphere later this year			1
right now , it 's still far away , but we 're keeping track and will give you regular updates			0
here are five key facts about @entity1 as we await its arrival : what 's with the funky name ? @entity1 was discovered by @entity16 astronomers @entity17 and @entity18 in september 2012			1
it 's named after their night - sky survey program , the @entity19 , a group of observatories in 10 countries organized to track objects in space			0
how big is it ? measurements taken by the @entity27 in april indicate @entity1 has a nucleus that is 3 to 4 miles across			1
the comet 's head , or coma , is estimated to be 3,100 miles across , or 1.2 times the width of @entity33			0
the @entity27 team says its dust tail extends more than 57,000 miles -- more than twice the circumference of @entity37 , and far beyond the telescope 's field of view			1
ok , it 's a comet			0
are n't there lots of comets ? why is this one special ? some early comet prognosticators have tagged @entity1 " the comet of the century			2
" " @entity1 has the potential to be among the brightest comets of the last 50 years , " @entity46 , an astronomer at @entity47 at @entity47 , told @entity48			2
bodewits and other astronomers used @entity48 's @entity54 satellite to estimate @entity1 's water and dust production			1
how to tell space rocks apart " @entity1 belongs to a class of comets called @entity63 comets , " @entity58 of the @entity59 told @entity0			2
this means it will fly relatively close to our sun. these comets " teach us not only about comets , but also yield valuable and unique results about the sun , " he said			0
but before you get too excited , other experts caution it 's too early to know what @entity1 will do			1
" predicting the behavior of comets is like predicting the behavior of cats -- ca n't really be done , " @entity76 of @entity48 's @entity77 told @entity0 in march			2
welcome to the @entity82 ( we hope ) when can i see it ? in november , @entity1 is expected to fly through the sun 's atmosphere at about 700,000 miles above the surface			1
if it survives the sun 's heat , experts say it might glow as brightly as the moon and be briefly visible in daylight			1
its tail might stretch far across the night sky			0
or the sun could cause it to break apart			0
why asteroids do n't surprise us anymore what if @entity1 breaks apart ? is @entity37 in danger ? no. experts say the comet wo n't threaten @entity37			1
in fact , even if it breaks up , @entity58 says it could put on a big show			1
" if @entity1 splits , it might appear as a ' string of pearls ' when viewed through a telescope , " @entity58 told @entity48			0
" it might even resemble the famous @entity112 9 that hit @entity113 in 1994			0
" whatever happens to @entity1 , sky watchers in the @entity115 should have a good view for several months			2
@entity48 says it will pass almost directly over the @entity117 and will be visible all night long			0
follow @ @entity118 on @entity119 for more science news			0

@entity1 discovered in september , should pass within @entity37 's view this year
@entity27 team : @entity1 's dust tail could wrap around @entity37 twice , then some
it is expected to pass within sun 's atmosphere , and it should put on a big show
experts : @entity134 wo n't threaten @entity37 , even if sun 's heat breaks it apart as it passes
