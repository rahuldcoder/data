-- president @entity2 's poll numbers have hit a new low and he 's under fire for everything from the rise of @entity6 to the response to the @entity9 threat			1
so it may seem surprising to many readers that the @entity13 - winning economist @entity12 -- who has been one of the president 's strongest critics from the left -- has written a cover story for @entity18 entitled " in defense of @entity2			1
" the article is important			0
@entity12 rightfully directs our attention away from approval ratings and popularity -- measures that do n't tell us much about the place of our leaders in @entity29 history -- insisting instead that we should be focused on things that a president actually does			1
by this measure , @entity12 now argues that this administration has done a pretty good job overall			2
indeed , as he moves through a list of his major policy accomplishments , @entity12 concludes that @entity2 's legacy is downright impressive compared to his predecessors			1
" despite bitter opposition , " @entity12 writes , " despite having come close to self - inflicted disaster , @entity2 has emerged as one of the most consequential and , yes , successful presidents in @entity29 history			1
" but it is much too early to tell whether @entity12 's report card is correct			1
while he is spot on when saying that the policy record matters much more than short - term popularity as measured in the polls , the policy record of any president is extremely difficult to evaluate before a president has even finished his time in office			2
the other presidents who @entity12 would hope that @entity2 has been able to emulate -- as well as conservative leaders , like @entity56 and ( i would argue @entity58 ) who have had lasting policy records -- could n't really be judged until many years after leaving the @entity60			1
it usually takes some time to see whether a policy works			0
when @entity64 pushed @entity65 to pass @entity66 in 1965 , policymakers were still unclear whether the program would really eliminate the horrendous conditions facing elderly @entity29 , most of whom could not afford adequate health care			1
but the final legislation that passed @entity65 , which added physicians insurance and @entity74 to the hospital insurance that @entity64 had supported , proved to be a stunning success			2
while the programs have been far from perfect , a fascinating book edited by @entity78 and @entity79 , " legacies of the @entity81 , " convincingly demonstrates that the policies were extremely effective at eliminating this as a major social problem			0
but we did n't know that yet when @entity64 was stepping down			2
in 1986 and 1987 , @entity56 caused quite a stir among his own supporters when he moved forward with negotiations with @entity91 , culminating in the @entity93 agreement			2
over the next few years we saw that this was an important step in the end of the @entity97			0
yet from the perspective of 1988 , the nation could n't tell where this would all go			0
while there is evidence that @entity104 is having a substantial impact we do n't yet have enough evidence to judge how well it will do in ending the problem of uninsured @entity29 and lowering the costs of premiums			0
another measure that we use to judge whether policies are successful has to do with their ability to outlast the political coalition that built them			2
do they become entrenched in the system so that changes in the political winds do n't result in their being dismantled ? the @entity121 , created during the presidency of @entity123 , is an enduring and ingrained part of the nation 's banking system over a century later			0
the agricultural policies that @entity128 put in place with @entity65 remain an integral part of the farming economy , as do the basic protections afforded to @entity29 who deposit their savings in banks			2
the @entity136 has been accepted by politicians from both parties even after many years of conservative backlash toward policies promoting racial equality			0
the same is true with the achievements of some conservative presidents			0
although there have been a series of tax increases since 1982 , no president has overturned the basic slash in income tax rates achieved by @entity56 in 1981 that forever depleted the government of needed revenue			0
thus far , president @entity58 's vast expansion of the national security state in 9/11 has remained firmly in place ; in fact it has expanded , even with president @entity2 in office			1
while presidential popularity does n't tell us much about how a leader stacks up in history , the long - term popularity of programs does matter			0
great policies usually generate loyal constituencies			0
this is part of what makes them so difficult to retrench			0
president @entity128 famously said about @entity171 taxes , " with those damn taxes , no damn politician can ever scrap my social security program			0
@entity29 came to expect this as a benefit because of the taxes they paid , while millions of elderly @entity29 soon came to love their monthly pensionsâ € ” as did middle class families who felt relief from having t \ o shoulder the entire responsibility of taking care of their parents after their retirement			0
right now , we do n't know if @entity2 's programs will have this kind of feedback effect			1
his health care program remains unpopular , though more @entity29 want the program reformed rather than repealed , while his financial regulations have certainly not generated great admiration from middle class @entity29 who still feel that the world of finance favors the wealthy and who are less than confident the system wo n't collapse again			1
@entity2 's economic stimulus programs clearly helped the nation lift itself out of the @entity202 , but most @entity29 do n't credit his policies with the improvements that the nation has seen and many feel that the president did n't do enough to help with the bigger structural problems facing a shrinking middle class dealing with insecurity			1
so @entity12 has put forth an enormously important argument , but it is just too early to tell whether his early report card is correct			1
we need much more time to see what happens with the next administration , as well as what comes after , before we can really start to make clear judgments as to whether @entity2 's accomplishments were historic or whether he ends up being remembered as an average president .			1

@entity13 - winning economist @entity12 writes that @entity2 is one of most successful presidents
@entity223 : @entity2 's policies on health care , economy , regulation could prove successful
but he says it 's much too early to evaluate @entity2 's overall impact
@entity223 : *decisions* made by @entity64 , @entity56 , others were hard to fully assess for many years
