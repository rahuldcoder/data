-- @entity1 has extradited a man from @entity3 to face charges of people smuggling , after a three - and - a - half year manhunt by federal police and @entity8			1
the 42 - year - old man was allegedly involved in organizing a fishing boat carrying 56 people , which arrived in @entity1 waters from @entity14 in september 2010			1
he 's been charged with eight counts of people smuggling			1
if found guilty he faces up to 20 years in prison			0
@entity1 's minister for justice , @entity18 , said the man 's extradition sent a clear sign to other suspected traffickers			1
" the message to those who are suspected of participating in this evil crime is clear -- @entity1 law enforcement will ensure they are tracked down to face the full force of our laws , " he said			2
opinion : deterring and denying asylum seekers in @entity1 border crackdown soon after his election as prime minister in september 2013 , @entity34 declared an unofficial war on people smugglers			1
he announced " @entity39 , " a military - led crackdown meant to deter potential asylum seekers from making the risky voyage to @entity1 waters			1
the government said the policy would save lives lost at sea			2
critics responded that it was an attempt to evade @entity1 's international obligations to provide refuge to those fleeing persecution			2
on thursday , @entity34 announced again the policy was working ; no asylum seekers had successfully arrived in the country by boat in six months			1
" i 'm not declaring victory ; there 's no hint of mission accomplished , " @entity34 told reporters			0
however , he pointed out in a statement that under the former @entity67 government , during the same six - month period the previous year , 190 boats with 12,773 people had illegally arrived in @entity1 -- " more than a boat a day			1
" the operation may have been successful in reducing the number of boats arriving in @entity1 , but the government 's policy on asylum seekers has attracted fierce criticism			1
@entity76 has called the government treatment of asylum seekers " cruel , inhuman and degrading			2
" violence on @entity80 after taking office , the @entity34 government said it would continue a @entity67 plan to process all asylum seekers at offshore detention centers			1
one of the most controversial centers is on @entity80 , @entity87 , where hundreds of male asylum seekers are being held in four security compounds			2
the center opened in august 2013 , but the numbers of detainees , or transferees as they 're also known , has since swelled to more than 1,300			0
in february , uncertainty about their future , combined with antagonism between the detainees and @entity87 nationals working at the center , saw protests erupt into a night of violence			0
an independent review commissioned by the government into the riots heard claims of simmering tensions between asylum seekers and @entity87 nationals employed at the center			1
the report , released in may , found the detainees became angry after a meeting because they felt questions relating to when their claims would be processed were n't being answered			0
what happened next was a blur of beatings and clashes that ended in the death of one asylum seeker , @entity121 @entity120			0
dozens of others were injured , including one man who lost an eye , and another who was shot in the buttocks			0
@entity129 inquiry this month , a @entity130 into the february violence has heard submissions about the ongoing fear and trauma suffered by transferees on the island			0
" asylum seekers do not have enough clothing , or hygiene products			2
the facilities are grossly inadequate and unsanitary			0
mental health conditions are rife , " said @entity141 , a former @entity142 worker			0
another , former @entity146 security guard , @entity144 , told the inquiry that within a week after arriving on @entity80 he formed the opinion that " there is only one possible outcome on @entity80 and that is bloodshed			0
" he said he thought " violence was inevitable " because of the remote location of the center , the poor living and working conditions , tensions between local @entity87 guards and transferees and the lack of hope felt by the asylum seekers that their claims would ever be processed			1
the @entity130 is due to report on july 16 .			0
