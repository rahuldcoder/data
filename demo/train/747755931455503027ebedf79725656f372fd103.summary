-- the eyes of the gaming world are on @entity3 , which on wednesday is expected to unveil the @entity4 , the latest version of its popular gaming console			1
it 's been more than six years since the company launched its @entity9			0
that 's an eon in the warp - speed tech industry , and the company faces a drastically altered landscape as it enters a new round of battles with its top competitors : @entity19 's @entity18 and @entity20 ( and , now , the @entity21 )			1
long gone are the days when gamers had to pop into their local game shop for the latest titles			0
pc gaming , web streaming and smartphone and tablet games have all sapped the popularity of the venerable living - room console			1
in this new era of mobile , connected gaming , experts say faster processors and flashier specs wo n't be enough for the next generation			2
" if you look at where the market is headed , it 's clear that @entity3 needs to acknowledge that the traditional console business is dead , " said @entity37 , editor - in - chief of gaming site @entity38			1
" there will still be some room for big - budget , disc - based games sold at retail stores , sure			0
but mobile , free - to - play and social are huge in gaming , and the next @entity4 needs to accommodate those sectors			1
" still beloved among its legions of dedicated gamers , @entity3 has some work to do if it is to leapfrog back to the top of the gaming heap			2
its @entity59 , which was released in 2000 , is the top - selling gaming console of all time with more than 150 million sold			2
the @entity9 has held its own but is not believed to have come even close to that number , with estimates hovering around 77 million			0
that 's been enough to keep the console neck and neck with @entity19 ( which is rumored to be developing its own next - generation console , the @entity18 720 ) but trailing @entity20 , which has parlayed its wide appeal with family and casual gamers into the top spot since hitting the market in 2006			1
the success of the @entity20 , which let players manipulate in - game avatars by moving their bodies , spawned similar motion - controlled systems in 2010 from @entity19 ( @entity77 ) and @entity3 ( @entity78 )			1
but in 2013 , with the motion - control craze on the wane , @entity3 may sense a new opening			2
sales of the @entity21 , released in november , have stumbled out of the blocks as gamers continue processing the system 's multiscreen setup			2
observers like @entity37 say that will take a sales pitch that appeals to how today 's gamer plays as much as , or more than , how the new system performs			0
" @entity3 needs to show its next system is ready for the future , and this includes some crossover play with smartphones , digital distribution , cloud storage to help minimize the need for physical media and a free - to - play ecosystem that can bring in new gamers , " he said			0
" pure horsepower will be less important this time around			0
" the inevitable flood of rumors about this week 's announcement suggests that may be on @entity3 's mind as well			1
the new console will have the ability to stream online games , according to a report from the @entity113			2
unnamed sources say the tech will be used to let players play older @entity9 games on the new console as well as new ones			0
last year , @entity3 bought @entity119 , a cloud - based gaming company that let @entity122 gamers stream top games via broadband			1
images of what are claimed to be prototypes of the @entity4 's controllers have leaked and appear to show a " share " button , suggesting that social - sharing options will be baked into the system			1
and @entity3 has begun slashing prices on its handheld @entity134 gaming system , starting in @entity135 , leading some to speculate that there could be mobile integration in the @entity4			1
of course , like @entity138 and especially @entity19 , @entity3 wants to continue branding its console as an entertainment hub for the living room , not just a gaming toy			1
@entity3 is rumored to be developing its own online tv service to compete with cable , something it would feature heavily on a new @entity4			1
@entity4 already has streaming - media apps like @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149			2
gamers will be looking for all that and more			0
but , as some observers note , all of the extras will have to branch out from a very important home base			0
" the @entity9 has matured into a fantastic gaming system , " wrote @entity157 's @entity156			0
" @entity3 must maintain this luxury into the next generation			0
for all the extracurricular bells and whistles this system will boast , gamers still want to play great games that you ca n't experience anywhere else			0
exclusive games sell systems first			0

the eyes of the gaming world this week are on @entity3 , expected to unveil @entity4
rumors about wednesday 's launch focus on an online gaming feature , social sharing
new console would compete with @entity138 's @entity21 , @entity19 's @entity180
