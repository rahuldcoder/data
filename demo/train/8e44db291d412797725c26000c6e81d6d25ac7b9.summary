@entity1 is not just a bunch of hot air , the @entity0 said friday			1
the league said the @entity7 - bound @entity6 used footballs that did n't meet league specifications in the first half of the @entity12 championship game last sunday			1
" while the evidence thus far supports the conclusion that footballs that were under - inflated were used by the @entity6 in the first half , the footballs were properly inflated for the second half and confirmed at the conclusion of the game to have remained properly inflated , " the @entity0 's statement said			1
the statement said the @entity0 wants to know " specifically whether any noncompliance was the result of deliberate action			1
we have not made any judgments on these points and will not do so until we have concluded our investigation and considered all of the relevant evidence			1
" forty interviews have been conducted , the @entity0 said , but it did n't say whether investigators had talked to star quarterback @entity33 or coach @entity34			1
@entity33 , the central figure in the controversy , said thursday that nobody from the @entity0 had talked to him			1
he and the coach said they do n't know how the balls became under - inflated			1

what the heck is @entity1 ? eleven of the 12 game balls the @entity6 provided were under - inflated by about 2 pounds per square inch each , @entity56 reported			1
regulation pressure is 12.5 - 13.5 psi			2
a ball with lower inflation is supposedly easier to grip and may give the passer a competitive advantage			0
@entity0 executive vice president @entity66 and @entity67 of the law firm @entity69 , @entity65 are leading the investigation , the statement said , and @entity72 , an investigatory firm , has been hired to assist in reviewing electronic and video information			1

" i made a great play on a great player , and i wanted to keep it as a souvenir , " @entity81 said in an interview with @entity2 affiliate @entity98			0
" so i handed it off			0
" the next thing i know i 'm in the middle of @entity106 , so i do n't know how that happened , and i was just doing my job , and i seem to be in the middle of everything			0
but i 've got a ton of respect for that organization , @entity6			0
they outright beat us hands down and that 's pretty much all i can say about it			0
