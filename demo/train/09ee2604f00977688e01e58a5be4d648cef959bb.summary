-- @entity1 is set to unveil the next generation of @entity3 today			1
the new operating system , currently known as @entity5 , is the tech giant 's attempt to regain ground that it has lost to @entity10 , which surpassed @entity1 last year as the world 's most valuable company			1
it is n't the macbook or @entity15 that has @entity1 executives worried , though			2
it 's the sheer dominance of the @entity18			2
the @entity18 has n't skipped a beat since its debut last year			2
thanks to @entity10 's ingenuity , a shockingly low starting price and a strong marketing campaign , the device has sold more than 25 million units in less than a year and a half			1
more importantly , it has defined a whole new category of consumer devices			0
and it dominates that category with an iron fist			0
@entity18 competitors have come and gone , but none have been able to make a dent in the @entity18 's rapid growth			0
@entity39 has given up on the @entity40 , the @entity38 has underperformed and countless @entity42 tablets have fallen by the wayside			0
nothing has emerged as the alternative to the @entity18			1
windows 8 : one os to rule them all this presents a dangerous problem and an opportunity for @entity1			2
the tech giant can not let @entity10 monopolize the tablet market like @entity1 did with the desktop os. that would seal its fate as a technology power destined to diminish into a shell of its former self			0
there is a need for a legitimate alternative to the @entity18 , though , and the company that gets it right will emerge in a strong position to take a big piece of the fast - growing tablet market			2
success in tablets would boost @entity1 's profits , ease investor concerns about the shrinking pc market and set it up for future growth			0
that 's where @entity5 comes in			0
the next generation @entity47 , which will be unveiled at the @entity77 conference on tuesday , is not only designed for pcs , but it is also made to work on tablets as well			1
we got a taste of its touchscreen capabilities at the @entity86 conference earlier this year , but we expect @entity1 to unveil the first @entity5 tablet during tuesday 's keynote			1
our sources tell us that the device will be manufactured by @entity91 but has been designed meticulously by @entity1 in an attempt to create the @entity18 alternative			1
will @entity1 's gamble work ? can the company create an os that works seamlessly on both tablets and pcs ? and most of all , will it be useful enough , different enough and cheap enough to give the @entity18 a run for its money ? we 'll be closer to knowing the answers to those questions tuesday morning			1
the tablet wars are about to begin in earnest			0
