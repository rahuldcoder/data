@entity0 , @entity1 -- a few miles south of the town of @entity7 in eastern @entity1 , a group of men in uniform is slumped under a tree			1
they are dejected and exhausted , their eyes red with fatigue			0
they do not want to be filmed but tell us of the horror they endured a day earlier			0
as medics with the @entity1 army , they had transported the bodies of some 70 soldiers away from a combat zone and many more who were seriously wounded			1
they scarcely raise their heads when a @entity1 air force jet streaks across the sky , releasing its payload on a rebel - held area to the east			1
it 's the only action by the air force that we 've witnessed against a rebel force that 's suddenly gone on the offensive across a wide area of eastern @entity1			1
@entity1 president @entity37 warned saturday that the crisis with @entity39 has worsened in recent days and is inching closer to a " full - scale war			1
" border guard bases and checkpoints deserted the drive north from the port city of @entity45 -- only a couple of miles from the @entity49 border -- offered no evidence of a @entity1 presence			1
bases of the border guard service are deserted , checkpoints on rural roads abandoned , sandbags strewn along the verge			0
in effect , @entity1 has forfeited control of perhaps as much as 200 miles of its eastern border			1
the @entity1 claim that @entity49 artillery fired from across the border is helping the rebels advance and that thousands of @entity49 troops are mixed in with the separatists			1
6 questions -- and answers -- about the crisis in @entity1 certainly the rebel forces , now united under the banner of @entity39 -- or @entity39 -- are better armed and organized than they were two months ago			1
they have at least some @entity76 tanks ; many carry new weapons			0
and after spending months on the defensive , they are suddenly buoyant			0
by contrast , a small detachment of @entity1 troops we encountered on the way north seemed demoralized			1
one asked when the @entity85 would arrive to help @entity1 in its desperate need ; another gloomily predicted a rebel onslaught at any moment			1
when we finally reached @entity89 , a rebel checkpoint had been hastily erected at the edge of town			1
the men were sunburned and relaxed , waving us through without even checking documents , a rarity in a country where both sides relish leafing through passports			0
the town itself fell to the @entity102 separatists friday , part of an advance south that has encircled the remnants of the @entity106 , a volunteer militia fighting alongside government forces			1
several houses had been badly damaged and at least one was destroyed by a direct hit			0
locals said @entity1 fire was to blame , but there is no way to prove it			2
the shrapnel cut jagged holes in the metal fence of the modest home opposite and damaged the roof			0
the elderly couple who lived there seemed shocked by the violence that had erupted around their rural community			0
the husband , @entity125 , said he was pure @entity1 but accused the government of lying to the people			2
" the @entity1 came like peacekeepers , " he said , " but then they kill us			2
they 're destroying the whole @entity132 region			0
" but @entity125 , who is 80 , is n't about to be run out of the town where he was born			2
an eerie quiet in @entity0 as we finished speaking with @entity125 , a battered black sedan with a flak jacket hanging over the driver 's door pulled up , and a @entity39 fighter got out			2
he told us we must stop filming unless we could show press accreditation			1
but accreditation could be obtained only in @entity0 , a city not so easy to enter now with the @entity1 army shelling it			1
soon the fighter 's commander was on the scene , a tall man in his early 40s with an air of natural authority			0
" you know i can just take away your camera , " he said			0
we were not in a position to argue			0
instead he put two of his men in our minivan and dispatched us with an escort to @entity0 , some 30 miles away			2
as the vehicle raced across open country , they trained their @entity161 rifles out of the window , whether for show or because @entity1 units were still in the area was unclear			2
after a few minutes at the state security building in @entity0 , now the military headquarters of the separatists , we were allowed to go but advised not to leave the city until our accreditation was in order			1
in any case , trying to leave @entity0 in the late afternoon , when the shelling and rocket fire picks up , did n't seem the smartest idea			2
compared with two months ago , the city is eerily quiet			0
the outdoor cafes and parks that were crowded in the early summer are deserted and more stores are boarded up			0
shells have hit the stadium of the football club , @entity182 , and wrecked apartment buildings			0
it seems most of the people who are still here are those with nowhere else to go , caught in the middle of a war that threatens to lurch into the bitterly cold winter .			0

with rebel forces on offensive in eastern @entity1 , evidence of a military presence is scarce
@entity1 troops encountered by @entity2 appear demoralized
@entity2 crew asked to stop filming in one rebel - held town south of @entity0
