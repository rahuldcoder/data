-- two @entity3 volcanoes that began minor eruptions weeks ago are showing their strongest seismic activity yet , emitting small amounts of lava and ash along with smoke plumes , the @entity1 said tuesday			1
the observatory warned of more vigorous activity with the @entity14 and @entity15 volcanoes , both on the @entity16 -- though that will likely just mean more ash			1
@entity14 , a snow - covered , cone - shaped mountain , has been erupting since early may			0
while its activity since then has waxed and waned , seismic activity increased since tuesday morning and the volcano has started continuously shaking , said @entity23 , a geophysicist with the @entity24			1
some lava is flowing , and the volcano is spewing a cloud of steam and ash that has risen as high as 28,000 feet , said @entity23 , at the observatory in @entity31			1
" it 's a pretty good size , but not high enough to affect overflying aircraft between @entity34 and @entity35 , " he said			0
" it 's more of a problem for local aviation			0
" @entity14 is near the town of @entity40 , a regional transportation hub whose long @entity43 - era runway serves flights to area villages , @entity23 said			0
the ash has at times affected those local flights			0
@entity15 , about 60 miles from @entity14 , started showing activity in early june and began erupting june 13 , @entity23 said			1
it has also produced a lava flow and an ash plume , though not as high as @entity14 -- only about 8,200 feet			1
@entity15 is a broad mountain topped with a large , flat ice field , and in the middle is a small cone that produces the lava and ash			2
the eruptions of both volcanoes compare to those in the past , where activity lasted for weeks or months before dying down again			2
the main hazard now , @entity23 said , is ash fall , which is more of a nuisance than anything else			0
" so far there 's been trace amounts of ash , so it 's just a fine coating , " he said			2
" our best estimate of what is going to happen is similar to what 's happened in the past -- this level of activity and some level of ash			0

the volcanoes are both on the @entity16
they began erupting weeks ago but are now showing stronger seismic activity
they are producing small amounts of lava and ash
one of them is producing smoke plumes as high as 28,000 feet
