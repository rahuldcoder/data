just one decade after the @entity3 single currency was launched amid fanfare and fireworks , its future looks uncertain as the debt crisis that engulfed @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 threatens the entire bloc -- and the wider global economy			1
@entity12 , the bloc 's fourth - largest economy , is the latest country to be swept into the crisis			2
in june , it was forced to seek up to € 100 billion in aid from its eurozone peers to shore up its banking sector			0
@entity12 prime minister @entity22 said the deal had demonstrated the advantages of cooperation within the bloc and meant " @entity3 credibility won , the future of the euro won [ and ] @entity3 won			0
" why ratings agencies take center stage in crisis but the markets have remained skeptical , pushing up the costs of @entity12 's borrowings despite the bailout			2
@entity38 borrowing costs have also gone up as investors fret the problems will spread			0
@entity7 , meanwhile , faces its second election on june 17 and risks being ejected from the bloc			1
many analysts saw it all coming of course , arguing that one fiscal system could never work for 17 @entity49 countries that adopted the euro , serving more than 330 million people			1
the flaws were exacerbated after some countries were suspected of fudging their numbers , including @entity7 which in 2004 admitted it gave misleading information to gain admission to the eurozone			1
the crisis exploded after @entity7 revised its figures to show its 2009 budget deficit would be 12.7 % of gross domestic product -- far higher than the eurozone limit of 3 %			1
the bloc -- whose financial fractures may not have been apparent during the boom years -- then began to unravel			0
after @entity7 's dire numbers were revealed , investors panicked and the country was unable to raise money to fund itself			2
the country was forced to take a € 110 billion bailout from its eurozone peers and the @entity73			0
but @entity7 's bailout , rather than stemming the panic , served as a harbinger to the debt crisis			1
@entity80 debt crisis glossary the @entity81 , or @entity3 bailout fund -- set up to deal with further financial stumbles -- was quickly tapped again			1
@entity8 , felled by a black hole in its banking system , was forced to take a € 67.5 billion bailout package in november 2010			2
after the markets then closed their doors to @entity9 , it was also forced to take a € 78 billion bailout			0
the troubled nations implemented austerity measures to try to rein in their hefty piles of debt , but confidence in the bloc 's ability to stabilize itself continued to fall			0
the crisis may yet engulf @entity38 , which makes up 17 % of the eurozone economy			2
@entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 make up less than 6 % between them			1
and so @entity3 's politicians and officials have desperately tried to sort out the mess by coming up with ideas including boosting the bailout fund , bringing the disparate economies closer financially , and tapping other markets for funds			0
their previous measures proved ineffective , as the markets -- and the world -- remained unconvinced at the bloc 's ability to survive in its existing form .			0

debt crisis that 's engulfed @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 still a threat to entire eurozone
@entity7 now faces its second election , regarded as an effective *referendum* on whether it wants to stay in the eurozone
many said one fiscal system could never work for 17 countries and *300* million people
