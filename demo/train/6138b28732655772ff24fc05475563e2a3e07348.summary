-- president @entity1 tuesday delivered his second back - to - school message to the nation 's students -- an event marked by far less controversy than the first time around			1
the speech -- delivered to a thunderous round of applause from students at @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 -- encouraged students to make the most of their educational opportunities			1
" nobody gets to write your destiny but you , " @entity1 said			1
" your future is in your hands			0
your life is what you make of it			2
and nothing -- absolutely nothing -- is beyond your reach , so long as you 're willing to dream big , so long as you 're willing to work hard , so long as you 're willing to stay focused on your education -- there is not a single thing that any of you can not accomplish			2
" the president said education " never has been more important			1
" " i 'm sure there are going to be times in the months ahead when you 're staying up late doing your homework or cramming for a test , or you 're dragging yourself out of bed on a rainy morning and you 're thinking , oh boy , i wish maybe it was a snow day , " he said			0
" let me tell you , what you 're doing is worth it			0
... nothing is going to have as great an impact on your success in life as your education			2
" last year , his first as president , @entity1 's plan to deliver a similar message prompted an unexpected backlash from conservatives who worried he would push students to support his political agenda			1
however , the speech @entity1 delivered at a @entity57 school included no political references and was welcomed by conservatives			1
this year 's speech also focused on urging students to work hard in order to achieve their goals			1
" more and more , the kinds of opportunities that are open to you are going to be determined by how far you go in school , " @entity1 said			1
" the farther you go in school , the farther you 're going to go in life			2
and at a time when other countries are competing with us like never before ... your success in school is going to determine @entity75 's success in the 21st century			2
" he called on students to meet their responsibilities for school by showing up on time , paying attention in class , doing their homework , studying for exams and staying out of trouble			1
" i was n't always the best student when i was younger			0
i made my share of mistakes , " @entity1 said , going on to describe a scolding from his mother about the need for more effort			1
" it was pretty jolting , hearing my mother say that , " the president said			0
" but eventually , her words had their intended effect , because i got serious about my studies			0
i started to make an effort in everything i did			0
and i began to see my grades -- and my prospects -- improve			0
and i know that if hard work could make the difference for me , then it can make a difference for all of you			0
" he also urged students to take on new challenges , with specific encouragement to rebound from disappointment and failure to try again			0
" so , what i want to say to every kid ... [ is ] that life is precious , and part of what makes it so wonderful is its diversity , " the president said			0
" we should n't be embarrassed by the things that make us different			0
we should be proud of them			0
because it 's the things that make us different that make us who we are			0
" @entity1 also announced a second " commencement challenge , " where a high school making positive changes and advancements is selected by the @entity128 to have the president deliver its graduation speech			1
@entity1 addressed graduates from a high school in @entity133 , @entity134 , in 2009			1
some of the controversy surrounding the president 's education address last year involved a proposed lesson plan created by the @entity139 to accompany the speech			1
an initial version of the plan recommended that students draft letters to themselves discussing " what they can do to help the president			2
" the letters " would be collected and redistributed at an appropriate later date by the teacher to make students accountable to their goals , " the plan stated			2
after the criticism from conservatives , the @entity128 distributed a revised version encouraging students to write letters about how they can " achieve their short - term and long - term education goals			1
