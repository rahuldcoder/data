nineteen - year - old @entity12 stepped away from her @entity14 residence last month to buy groceries			2
her family never saw her again until security forces returned her mutilated corpse , two opposition activist groups operating inside @entity3 and @entity19 told @entity0			0
as reports of the torture sparked outrage across @entity14 and the rest of the world , amateur video surfaced of dozens of woman protesting the death			2
" they killed the @entity31 , " their placards said			1
" if it is confirmed that @entity31 was in custody when she died , this would be one of the most disturbing cases of a death in detention we have seen so far , " said @entity32 , @entity19 's deputy director for the @entity33 and @entity34			1
the case also drew the antipathy of the @entity45 @entity44 , which characterized the incident as " appalling " and as one example of the " targeting and attacking of families and sympathizers of the protesters by security forces			1
" the ferocious @entity3 government crackdown against dissenters began in mid-march when anti-government protests unfolded			0
the number of people killed over the past six months has reached at least 2,700 , according to the @entity45 human rights office			2
some activist groups put the toll at around 3,000			0
@entity31 's brother @entity62 -- a prominent opposition activist praised by colleagues for leading anti-government protests and treating the wounded -- had been evading authorities for weeks when his sister disappeared , said the @entity65 , an activist group			1
" the secret police kidnapped @entity31 so they could threaten her brother and pressure him to turn himself in to the authorities			2
