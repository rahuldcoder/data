-- in response to @entity4 's invasion and annexation of parts of @entity7 , president @entity1 this week announced new sanctions against 11 @entity4 and @entity7 officials			1
these sanctions , issued in concert with similar announcements by the @entity13 , are wildly disproportionate			1
disproportionately small , that is			2
we are ignoring the lessons of history that demonstrate how unusual and unacceptable invasion and annexation are in the @entity21 era			1
@entity4 has unleashed a process of domination and annexation that will lead to territorial acquisition by force			1
although this has been roundly condemned rhetorically by many world leaders , including our own , the paltry international response thus far indicates that this aggression is not being taken seriously enough			2
we do not live in a @entity32 age when force of arms determines boarders			2
the @entity36 has codified the modern view of the international community -- a view that utterly rejects ancient practices of conquest by force			2
further , forceful international reaction to banditry like that of @entity4 president @entity45 provides the opportunity to reinforce the new norm and the strength of feeling followed by the commitment to enforce it			1
the sanctions announced by the @entity1 administration and our @entity54 allies not only fail to measure up to those new standards , but this rap on a few knuckles will surely encourage the @entity4 aggressors and alarm its neighbors			1
there are no more than 20 instances of attempted aggression , invasion and annexation since the end of @entity69 's conquest of @entity70 in 1975 followed two decades of war attempting to resist it			0
@entity73 was annexed by @entity74 in 1975 , leading to two decades of guerrilla war and eventual independence			0
the international community never recognized the annexation , and vigorous @entity36 peacekeeping and engagement was critical to solution			0
@entity83 's annexation of the @entity84 has led to almost 40 years of war and continuous international efforts at negotiation			0
the invasion and annexation of @entity90 in 1990 led to a massive international effort to reverse that move , involving a half million @entity94 troops			1
@entity96 's invasion of the @entity97 in 1982 was met with full - fledged naval warfare by the forces of the @entity100			0
@entity4 's invasion of @entity7 and imminent territorial annexation must be viewed in this historical context			1
the bogus referendum this past weekend fools no one			0
the international response so far is to deny visas to a small group of @entity4 officials and deny them access to whatever property they have stashed abroad			1
this simply is not enough			0
sen. @entity114 , @entity115 , and i introduced a resolution earlier this month outlining specific steps we believe the administration should take to sanction and isolate @entity4			1
the full @entity121 unanimously supported that resolution , yet the administration has chosen to take none of these steps			0
last week i asked secretary of state @entity124 if the @entity125 is considering any of the recommendations we put forward , ideas backed by all 100 @entity94 senators			1
his reply was dismissive and nonresponsive			0
sanctioning a handful of @entity4 most responsible for this aggression is a good first step , but too little to influence a change in the @entity4 position			2
much more needs to be done			0
there is strong bipartisan support for more forceful economic sanctions than what the administration announced on monday			2
we must take more meaningful -- and more properly proportionate -- steps to respond to this outrage of aggression			0
join us on @entity146 / @entity145			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of sen. @entity149 .			1

sen. @entity149 argues that recent sanctions against @entity4 are not enough
@entity94 , @entity13 actions following the @entity155 *occupation* wo *n't* deter @entity45 , he says
we are ignoring the lessons of history , @entity149 says
