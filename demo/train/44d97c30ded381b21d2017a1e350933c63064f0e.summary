the @entity0 will seek a federal court order forcing @entity2 to resume " preclearing " any changes to its voting laws , the first enforcement action by the @entity8 administration since the @entity9 tossed out a key provision of the landmark @entity11			1
attorney general @entity14 made the announcement thursday in a speech before the @entity17			1
" my colleagues and i are determined to use every tool at our disposal to stand against discrimination wherever it is found , " @entity14 said in @entity18			1
" even as @entity24 considers updates to the @entity11 in light of the court 's ruling , we plan , in the meantime , to fully utilize the law 's remaining sections to ensure that the voting rights of all @entity34 citizens are protected			0
" a divided 5 - 4 @entity9 last month invalidated the formula used to determine which states or local jurisdictions -- mostly in the @entity38 -- could remain under special federal oversight , requiring them to get approval from @entity42 before making any changes in voting procedures			1
conservatives fume when @entity14 talks race and law that blunts much of the federal government 's enforcement power in states and localities with a history of discrimination at the polls			1
the ruling does not change the fact it remains illegal to discriminate against a person when it comes to voting			0
but it does change how some governments have been singled out			0
@entity14 said the @entity8 administration will use a different section of the @entity11 that allows federal authorities to ask a judge to order a state to be put under the preclearance regime			1
to do so the @entity0 must prove " purposeful " discrimination			1
@entity2 will be test case of the tactic			1
the state is the subject of two ongoing court fights over its voter identification law and the voting boundaries created by the legislature			0
@entity2 attorney general @entity78 had indicated after the high court ruling that both the state voter identification law and its redistricting maps would go into effect immediately			1
@entity83 gov. @entity83 criticized @entity14 's remarks and defended the @entity2 " voter integrity " laws			1
" once again , the @entity8 administration is demonstrating utter contempt for our country 's system of checks and balances , not to mention the @entity94 , " @entity83 said in a prepared statement			2
" this end - run around the @entity9 undermines the will of the people of @entity2 , and casts unfair aspersions on our state 's common - sense efforts to preserve the integrity of our elections process			1
" sen. @entity103 , @entity104 , was also defiant			0
" @entity106 should not -- and will not -- stand for the continued bullying of our state by the @entity8 administration , " he said in a news release thursday			0
lawmakers in @entity24 have begun considering proposals to update the @entity11 to ensure continued federal oversight			0
@entity14 said that while his department could act unilaterally , updating current laws is the real key			2
" it is the duty of today 's @entity0 to continue monitoring jurisdictions around the country for changes that may hamper these voting rights -- to keep taking appropriately aggressive action against any jurisdiction that attempts to hinder free and fair access to the franchise , " he said			2
" and to keep refining and refocusing current enforcement efforts while we work with @entity24 to craft stronger tools for protecting voting rights			0
" @entity14 called the high court ruling " deeply disappointing and flawed			2
" under the section of the @entity11 invalidated by the high court , any changes in voting laws and procedures in all or parts of 15 covered states -- including @entity2 -- were subject to federal oversight			2
that meant the @entity0 or a federal court had to sign off on all aspects , including something as simple as moving a polling place temporarily across the street			2
the provision was reauthorized by @entity24 in 2006 for another 25 years			0
officials in @entity148 , @entity149 , subsequently filed suit , saying the monitoring was overly burdensome and unwarranted			0
chief justice @entity154 , in his majority opinion , for the @entity9 , said the decades - old formula still being used had " no logical relation to the present day			2
" " while any racial discrimination in voting is too much , @entity24 must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy the problem speaks to the current conditions , " he said			0
president @entity8 had characterized the ruling as a " setback , " even as he vowed his " administration will continue to do everything in its power to ensure a fair and equal voting process			0
" @entity2 will not be the first state the @entity0 has sought to " bail in " under a different enforcement regime from the @entity11 , which would still be allowed in the wake of the high court decision			1
parts of @entity174 and @entity175 also were subject to that special federal oversight , but the provision requires the @entity0 to establish a new , comprehensive record of alleged " intentional " discrimination			1
that means the burden of proof would initially be on @entity42 to show a state like @entity2 deserves continued special scrutiny			0
if that oversight is granted , the burden of proof would then shift to the state , when justifying any future changes in its voting laws .			0

gov. @entity83 : this " undermines the will of the people of @entity2 "
the @entity0 wants to *restore* " preclearance " provisions
attorney general *holder* : we *'ll* " use every tool at our disposal to stand against discrimination "
the @entity9 tossed out the old rule ; @entity14 will try another tactic
