editor 's note : @entity2 , a senior political contributor for @entity4 , was political director for president @entity5 and chairman of the @entity7			1
@entity2 says @entity9 's intellect and force of personality helped guide the @entity12			1
@entity13 ( @entity4 ) -- the world of politics has many players but few giants			2
one of the giants left the stage last week			2
i was privileged to have had @entity9 as a friend			1
our friendship was not unique , because @entity9 had thousands and maybe tens of thousands of people who thought of themselves as his friend			1
he gave his friendship willingly and with a spirit of generosity			2
those of us who knew him are saddened by his passing and the political world is a whole lot emptier because he 's gone			2
when @entity9 entered a room he filled it with an energy and fervor and his presence was felt big - time			1
every conversation with him became a debate , even if you agreed with him on an issue			2
@entity9 had no casual thoughts			1
i knew @entity9 for nearly 40 years			1
he was one of my early heroes			2
to this day i think of myself as a @entity45 @entity12			1
we both were @entity47 who came out of blue - collar working - class roots			0
his father was a truck driver , my father a shipyard worker			0
we both wanted to remake the @entity12 into a party for working people where hard work was rewarded and opportunities were offered to every man and woman regardless of background , color , religion or beliefs			1
@entity9 went from a 13 - year all - star career as the starting quarterback with the @entity65 straight to @entity66			1
he was first elected in 1970 and over the next four decades he was one of the most influential and popular men in the @entity12			1
he was a true intellectual , a vociferous reader and was a warrior for his ideas			2
he took the intensity that made him the @entity72 's most valuable player directly to the halls of @entity66 without missing a beat			0
in his 18 years in @entity66 he was a leader of the new breed of conservatives			0
after he ran for president in 1988 , he was appointed the @entity78 ( @entity79 ) by president @entity80			0
in 1996 , he was the @entity12 vice presidential nominee running with sen. @entity82 's presidential effort			1
along the way he was an extraordinary husband for 50 years to his wonderful @entity84 and a remarkable father to his two sons , @entity87 and @entity88 , and his two daughters , @entity90 and @entity91 , who provided him 17 grandchildren			0
i was the national chairman of @entity9 's presidential campaign in 1988			1
i believed he was the rightful heir to @entity5 and that his conservative principles and ideas would continue to build on the foundation that president @entity5 had established			1
many of us thought @entity9 or sen. @entity100 , @entity5 's closest friend and campaign chairman , should have been the vice presidential candidate in 1980			1
if either of them had been selected , he likely would have been the future president and there would not have been a @entity80 dynasty			0
they were the favorites of the convention delegates and president @entity5 's top choices , too			0
he was argued out of them because people said you could n't have a movie star running with a football star -- or two former governors from neighboring states ( @entity47 and @entity116 )			0
be that as it may			0
@entity9 's contributions to @entity5 's legacy as the tax - cutting guru and unstoppable missionary of supply side economics made much of president @entity5 's domestic policy possible			1
even though he had always been a quarterback , he became a blocking back for president @entity5 in moving his legislation through @entity66			0
shortly after he became @entity79 secretary in 1989 , several @entity128 team owners came to him offering him the job of @entity128 commissioner to replace his long time friend @entity132			0
he told me it was the one job he always wanted			0
my counsel was to take it			0
he called me back several days later and said he could n't , because he felt he owed it to president @entity80 not to walk away after so short a time and that he so wanted to help all those in the urban communities who needed help			0
@entity9 was the @entity12 's greatest advocate of a " big tent theory " and felt the party of @entity146 needed to do more to broaden civil rights and encourage minority participation			1
he often said he played and showered with more african - americans then most @entity12 meet in a lifetime			1
they were his friends , and in sports you learn all men bleed the same color			0
he often repeated the line : " i was n't there with @entity158 or dr. @entity159 or @entity160			0
but i am here now , and i am going to yell from the rooftops about what we need to do			0
" and just as he led his bills to back to back championships , he drove his party to an ideology that led to the @entity169 majorities in the ' 90s			2
like all of us , @entity9 was n't perfect , but he was darn good			1
as someone who tried to manage him , i found that he was n't manageable			0
i once told him : " @entity9 , if i could remove half your knowledge and three - quarters of your vocabulary , i could make you into a decent candidate			2
" he laughed and went on his merry way			0
and of course it was that incredible intellect and his passion for words as well as people that made him such a powerful force			0
@entity9 was the indefatigable happy warrior , who over the last four decades drove his party with an intellectual fervor that influenced every leader from president @entity5 to speaker @entity189			1
he fought for his ideas with an intensity like that of very few men i have known			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : @entity9 helped guide @entity12 in 1980s and 1990s
he says @entity9 was a strong source of ideas the party put to use
@entity2 : @entity9 believed in a @entity12 " big tent " and encouraged minority participation
