@entity0 -- in an expanding investigation into teacher misconduct , @entity0 school officials are going back 40 years in their internal review of teacher discipline cases in an effort to determine whether any of the instructors should also be referred for possible license revocation , a school spokesman said friday			1
@entity13 superintendent @entity12 has asked the principals at more than 1,000 schools to search the files of the past 40 years for " any cases of possible employee misconduct , " spokesman @entity11 told @entity1			1
the 40 - year period is a significant expansion from the past four years of misconduct cases that the system has already reviewed			1
so far , @entity0 school officials have referred the discipline cases of 604 teachers from the past four years to state authorities who have powers to revoke a teacher 's credentials , officials said			1
of those 604 cases in which teachers were fired or facing discipline , 60 teachers were accused of sexual misconduct with pupils on or off campus or with minors who were n't students , school officials said			1
the @entity43 will investigate 366 of the 604 teacher cases to determine if licenses should be revoked , which is a six - month process , spokeswoman @entity42 said			1
most of the cases focused on allegations of teacher misconduct that involved student safety			1
@entity42 said friday that 122 of the 604 cases were referred back to the school district for further information because the state agency did n't have the authority to investigate			1
she also told @entity1 that 103 of the 604 cases were duplicates and were already being investigated by the agency 's committee on credentials			2
" for the vast majority , no final action has been taken			0
they are still in process , " @entity42 said about the 103 cases			2
the referral of the cases to state licensing investigators comes as the nation 's second largest school system deals with a crisis of teacher misconduct			1
the district has been reeling from a scandal at @entity74 , where two teachers have been charged with lewd acts on pupils , including one teacher accused of putting children in adult - like bondage situations and placing semen - filled spoons at their mouths			2
the state license of that teacher , @entity74 -- who has pleaded not guilty to 23 counts of lewd acts on pupils -- has been suspended as the state agency monitors his criminal case , and a license revocation occurs upon a conviction , @entity42 said			1
if an appeal to a conviction is made , the suspension of teaching credentials continues , @entity42 said			0
this week , the @entity96 approved a bill that would empower school boards to fire teachers for misconduct and expedite the firing process of instructors accused of offenses involving sex , violence or drugs , said @entity108 state sen. @entity107 , who authored the legislation			1
the bill now goes to the @entity111 for a vote			2
" because a school board is ultimately responsible for ensuring a safe learning environment , the school board should be empowered to dismiss employees they determine to be a serious threat to the health and safety of students , " sen. @entity42 said in a statement			0
the lurid allegations at @entity74 prompted the @entity0 system to do an internal review of its handling of past teacher misconduct cases , and the district determined that 604 cases needed to be referred to state licensing authorities for review , though " a substantial number " of other misconduct cases had already been reported to the state , school officials said			1
one parent , @entity137 , told @entity1 that he was concerned about child abuse in the school system			0
" it tended to be a safe place , but from what i hear , it seems that 's not happening in some places , " @entity137 said			0
" there is n't sufficient security for children			0
" we 're able to realize that there was n't much of an investigation with teachers and they did n't investigate them before giving them a job , and those who suffer are the children , the pupils , " @entity137 said			0
the 604 cases include teachers who were disciplined or were about to face discipline since july 2008 , according to @entity159 , @entity74 director of employee relations , and @entity161 , the district 's chief human resources officer			1
the cases also include teachers who were fired by the school board or who left the district after termination proceedings were initiated or while an allegation of misconduct was pending , @entity171 and @entity161 said			1
the system does n't know whether any of the teachers who were fired or who left the district are still in the classroom in other school districts			2
the 604 figure also includes teachers who were suspended for 11 days or more for a variety of reasons not involving sexual misconduct with students , the two officials said			1
" the safety of our students is our no. 1 priority , " @entity161 said in explaining why the system referred the 604 cases to the state			2
the system 's internal investigation arose after parental outrage after charges were filed against former @entity74 teacher @entity194 , who resigned from the system last year but was not referred to the state for possible license revocation , district spokesman @entity11 said			1
@entity194 , 61 , pleaded not guilty in february to allegations he bound young students , then photographed them with semen - filled spoons held at their mouths and three - inch cockroaches crawling across their faces , among other graphic depictions			0
" we had not informed @entity205 to revoke mr. @entity194 's credentials , " @entity11 said			0
@entity194 is being held on $ 23 million bond and faces 23 counts of lewd acts on a child			0
the 23 victims were between 7 and 10 years old , and all but two of them were girls , the @entity212 's @entity211 said			0
authorities have said they have discovered roughly 600 images allegedly taken by @entity194 in his classroom			0
@entity74 superintendent @entity12 has said @entity194 was removed from his teaching job in january 2011 after school officials learned of the police investigation			2
a teacher for 30 years , @entity194 initially challenged the school district 's decision to dismiss him			2
but he eventually dropped his appeal and resigned last spring			0
his arrest in january led to broader fallout over the adequacy of safeguards for the school 's students and the prospect of more victims			0
days after @entity194 was taken into custody , another @entity74 teacher -- @entity74 , 49 -- was arrested and charged with three felony counts of lewd acts with a girl younger than 14			0
he has pleaded not guilty			0
the @entity74 board subsequently shut @entity74 for two days , during which the board reconstituted the entire staff in the 1,400 - student school			0
@entity74 is in unincorporated @entity212 within the @entity245 area , about six miles south of downtown @entity0 .			2

@entity0 school officials are now going back 40 years in their review of past teacher misconduct
they have just reviewed the past four years of teacher discipline cases
@entity0 school officials referred 604 teacher cases to state authorities in charge of license revocation
@entity96 passes a bill that makes firing teachers for misconduct easier
