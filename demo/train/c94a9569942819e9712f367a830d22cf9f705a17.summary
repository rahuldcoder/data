-- @entity1 , criticized and even despised for its inability to keep up with growing mobile data usage , thinks it has found the solution to its network woes			1
and all it will cost the telecom giant is $ 39 billion and months ( or even years ) of regulatory hurdles			1
in a stunning move , @entity1 has acquired @entity10 for a whopping $ 39 billion from @entity11			1
along with acquiring approximately 8 % of @entity1 , @entity11 will also be gaining a seat on @entity1 's board of directors			1
the new combined entity , if it can garner regulatory approval , will be largest carrier in the @entity16 by leaps and bounds			0
@entity1 and @entity10 combined have over 25 % more subscribers now than @entity20 ( 125 + million vs. 93 + million )			1
this acquisition is n't about subscriber bases , though ; it 's about improving @entity1 's reliability and preparing it for the @entity25 era of wireless communication			2
the spectrum problem @entity1 's press release tells a very clear story of why @entity1 bought @entity10 and why @entity10 bought @entity1			1
it 's no secret that @entity1 has a tattered reputation			0
the @entity32 may have brought it millions of new customers and billions in revenue , but the vast increase in data usage has also strained the network to unacceptable levels			0
there would n't have been so much hype surrounding the @entity32 if @entity1 's network did n't drop so many calls and upset so many customers			1
and while @entity1 is investing billions to upgrade its network , it takes years to get the approval to build new towers , especially in metropolitan areas such as @entity49			2
without a dramatic move , @entity1 's network was n't going to get better anytime soon			2
two sections of @entity1 's press release are devoted specifically to this problem			0
it 's a testament to just how crucial this problem is to @entity1 's future			0
the first problem it addresses is spectrum : the wireless carrier simply does n't have enough wireless spectrum to fuel the accelerating growth it has experienced over the last few years			0
" @entity1 's mobile data traffic grew 8,000 percent over the past four years and by 2015 it is expected to be eight to 10 times what it was in 2010 , " @entity1 explained in its announcement			0
" put another way , all of the mobile traffic volume @entity1 carried during 2010 is estimated to be carried in just the first six to seven weeks of 2015			0
" @entity1 believes it will take years until more spectrum is opened up by the @entity16 government for mobile broadband use			0
the simplest way to get its hands on precious broadband is through acquisition , and @entity10 has the most gsm broadband spectrum after @entity1			1
the infrastructure problem the second problem is infrastructure			0
@entity1 simply ca n't build towers fast enough , and the approval process to build the unsightly things acts as a major roadblock to the company 's efforts to boost its network reliability			2
so if you ca n't build towers fast enough , what 's the next best way to get them ? that 's right : you acquire them			0
" at closing , @entity1 will immediately gain cell sites equivalent to what would have taken on average five years to build without the transaction , and double that in some markets , " @entity1 notes in its press release			0
" the combination will increase @entity1 's network density by approximately 30 percent in some of its most populated areas , while avoiding the need to construct additional cell towers			2
" $ 39 billion is a lot of money to buy some towers , but because @entity10 utilizes gsm technology ( rather than the cdma technology employed by @entity20 ) , it can immediately use them to boost its network			1
if the deal is approved , expect @entity1 to quickly offload some of its mobile data traffic on @entity10 's infrastructure			1
@entity1 may be talking a lot about @entity25 in its press release , but @entity10 has no @entity116 technology or infrastructure to offer			1
no , today 's acquisition is all about bolstering @entity1 's network and beginning the process of repairing its reputation			2

@entity1 thinks it has found the solution to its network woes
