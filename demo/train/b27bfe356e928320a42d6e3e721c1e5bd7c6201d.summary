teenager @entity0 did n't die when a plane crashed at @entity2 last july			1
she actually survived the impact , only to die minutes later after a fire truck ran over her			2
now , newly released video suggests emergency workers saw @entity0 's injured body on the ground before she was fatally struck -- challenging earlier claims that she was accidentally run over because she may have been covered in firefighting foam			1
in the footage , one firefighter tried to stop an emergency vehicle racing toward the scene			1
" @entity14 , whoa , whoa ! stop , stop , stop ! there 's a body ... there 's a body right there			2
right in front of you , " the firefighter told the driver			0
the video was captured on a camera attached to a firefighter 's helmet and first aired by @entity28			2
another video from a fire truck shows a firefighter on the ground directing the truck around a victim , who was not covered in foam at the time			2
@entity0 , 16 , was on her way to an @entity39 summer camp from her home in @entity41			1
@entity42 , a lawyer for her family , said the video shows several firefighters saw her lying on the tarmac , but none " did the basic step of checking if she was alive			1
" " it 's unthinkable , " @entity42 told @entity52 's " @entity51 360			0
" " it 's unimaginable , because the first thing -- the first priority of the firefighters or any rescue personnel -- is saving lives , and the first step in triage is to take the pulse , check the respiration			0
" a @entity65 coroner ruled that @entity0 was alive when flung from the plane but died of " multiple blunt injuries that are consistent with being run over by a motor vehicle			1
" " those injuries she received , she was alive at the time , " @entity70 coroner @entity69 said			2
@entity0 's parents have filed a gross negligence claim against the city and county of @entity2 , arguing that the emergency responders who spotted @entity0 on the ground " failed to move her to a safe location , failed to mark her location ; failed to protect her from moving vehicles in the vicinity of the aircraft where it was known that vehicles would be traveling ; failed to alert commanders at the scene ; and / or abandoned @entity0 in a perilous location			1
" @entity42 said the teenager 's parents were devastated by her death			0
" in @entity41 , they 're really only supposed to have one child , " he said			0
" this was the family 's only child , a girl who was a star student , who was the focus of their lives			0
everything that they did was poured into this girl and her future , and that was taken away because of some terrible mistakes and inaction by the firefighters			0
" the @entity109 declined comment on the video , citing the pending claim			0
but in july , fire chief @entity113 offered her department 's " condolonces and apologies " to the @entity0 family			1
" we 're heartbroken , " @entity113 said			0
" we 're in the business of saving lives ... there 's not a lot of words to describe how badly we feel about it			0
" no charges for firefighter who ran over @entity128 crash survivor two other people died when @entity131 crash - landed at the @entity2 airport july 6			1
the @entity133 said the jet descended in altitude faster than it should have , and had a slower forward speed than intended			0
