@entity0 -- a @entity3 woman said she went into " survival mode " when a huge eagle ray weighing as much as 300 pounds landed on top of her on a boat in the @entity8 , throwing her to the deck and pinning her underneath it			1
@entity11 was riding on a chartered boat friday with her husband and three children , taking pictures of a group of eagle rays as they launched themselves out of the water			1
" as i was snapping a picture of the eagle ray in the water , it jumped out and i was able to get the picture of it flying in the air			1
and then the next jump , the eagle ray jumped straight into our boat , straight at my chest -- 300 pounds -- and knocked me backwards and was flapping around on top of me , " @entity11 told @entity1 wednesday			1
" i just basically pushed it off , pushed it off of me and tried to scoot backwards as fast as i could			0
i think all of us were in survival mode at that point and just doing whatever we could to get away from the ray , " she recounted			2
one of her sons was hit with one of the ray 's " wings , " her other son slid off the animal to the floor of the boat , and the ray flew over her daughter as it soared into the air , @entity11 said			1
" everybody was able to keep their wits about them and was very brave and ... my husband picked up my daughter right away and made sure she was safe , " @entity11 said , adding that she knew there could have been a far worse outcome			1
in 2008 , a woman died after a ray jumped out of the water and hit her as she boated in the @entity8			2
" i believe the eagle ray hit her a little bit higher in the neck , so we were very fortunate			2
if it had been a few inches higher , it could have been a much worse outcome			0
luckily , the barbs did not hit anyone , " @entity11 said			2
@entity66 rays can measure as much as 10 feet across and 17 feet long -- from their snout to the end of their barbed tails -- and weigh up to 500 pounds , according to the @entity71			1
the spines on the tails are venomous and can inflict serious wounds			0
after the @entity77 scrambled to safety away from the ray , two @entity76 officers patrolling nearby came to their aid after hearing the screams			0
" we turned around and looked and saw the eagle ray thrashing around in the boat and at that point we realized we had a problem , " said officer @entity81			0
@entity81 and officer @entity86 wrangled the sea creature back into the water , where it swam away , apparently unscathed			0
@entity90 , who was captain of the @entity92 boat the @entity93 had rented , said the animal measured 8 - feet across , and probably weighed a good 300 pounds			1
" it 's just massive , it has a 10 - foot tail , " she added			0
@entity11 's children were hysterical , but she and her husband decided to continue the charter in hopes that the incident would n't make them afraid of the water			1
@entity81 said the incident was a " total one - in - a - million chance			0
" " these animals are n't attacking by any means , " she said			0
" one theory is these animals jump during mating season			0

@entity11 was taking pictures of the rays as they flew out of the water
