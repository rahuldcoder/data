-- if @entity2 were commissioner of the @entity3 , would running back @entity1 have already been banned from the league ? and if @entity6 were in charge of the @entity8 , would @entity5 still be the owner of the @entity9 ? what - ifs and role reversals can make your head spin			1
what we have are two leagues and two vastly different responses to separate hot - button issues : racism and domestic violence			2
silver had little time to settle into his new job			2
he took over from longtime @entity8 commissioner @entity24 on february 1 , and by late april , he was already embroiled in the @entity5 controversy			1
even with the short break - in period , @entity2 won rave reviews			1
he earned them by acting swiftly , sending investigators to @entity30 to confirm it was @entity5 who made racist comments on an audio recording obtained by @entity35			2
within days , @entity2 acted , banning the @entity9 owner for life , fining him $ 2.5 million and initiating proceedings to terminate @entity5 's ownership rights			1
it was n't easy , but @entity2 held firm			1
@entity5 went back and forth about selling the team , and made additional reprehensible comments , some in an interview with @entity0 's @entity46			2
in it , @entity5 repeatedly apologized and denied accusations that he 's racist , saying he 'd been " baited " into making what he called " terrible " remarks			2
still , in the interview , @entity5 continued attacks on former @entity8 great @entity53			1
in it , he questioned the character of the former @entity57 player and his battle with @entity59 , saying @entity53 has n't done anything to help others			2
but @entity53 shrugged it off , saying he feels sorry for the billionaire and will pray for him			0
in the end , @entity2 's actions were seen as decisive and unflinching			1
players , team owners and civil rights advocates applauded him			0
" there 's no room for @entity5 in the @entity8 , " @entity69 said before a game in april			1
" there is no room for him			0
" " this attack on @entity78 is crazy , " filmmaker @entity75 told @entity46 after the interview			0
" he 's messing with the wrong brother			2
@entity78 is loved by everybody around the world			0
and the talk about some other stuff that has nothing to do with nothing is ridiculous			0
" @entity5 asked : what has @entity53 done ? answer : quite a lot there was some criticism , like why did it take the @entity8 so long to get rid of @entity5 when he had been accused of racism several times in the past			1
in 2009 he settled -- while admitting no liability -- three lawsuits tied to discrimination claims at apartments he owned in @entity100 , the @entity93 reported			0
he also settled a 2003 lawsuit that claimed he would n't rent to @entity103 , the @entity93 reported			0
@entity5 also was sued in 2009 by former @entity9 general manager @entity104 , who said he was a victim of age and racial discrimination			0
@entity107 dropped the race claim and a jury ruled in @entity5 's favor			2
@entity5 interview bobbling the ball now compare that with @entity6 's handling of the @entity1 case			1
critics say he fumbled it from the start			0
it was @entity35 again with the damning evidence			0
security camera video showed the former @entity123 dragging an unconscious @entity124 -- then his fiancee -- out of an elevator			0
that was back in february , at the beginning of the off - season			0
the couple married in march			0
voices of domestic violence it would be several months before @entity6 interviewed @entity1 and his wife			1
and when he did , the two were reportedly in the room together			0
another month passed before @entity6 gave @entity1 a two - game suspension , and that did n't sit well with many people			1
@entity6 insisted it was consistent with other cases			1
eventually , @entity6 admitted that it was a mistake and drew up new domestic violence policy with harsher penalties that were a reaction to the criticism			1
the harshest blow to @entity6 's handling of the case came this week when @entity35 released another video that showed @entity1 throwing the punches that knocked out @entity124			1
the @entity153 dropped him from the team , and the @entity3 suspended him indefinitely			1
@entity3 chief @entity6 faces intense criticism taking the hits critics want to know why a tougher punished was n't handed out sooner			1
" i did n't get it right , " said @entity6			1
" simply put , we have to do better			0
" the @entity161 thinks so			0
@entity161 is calling for @entity6 's resignation			1
" the @entity3 has lost its way , " said a statement released late tuesday by now president @entity164			2
" it does n't have a @entity1 problem ; it has a violence against women problem			0
" @entity161 also noted @entity6 's silence on the @entity170 lawsuit			1
a former exotic dancer sued the @entity173 owner this week , accusing him of sexual assault			0
an attorney for the team called the allegations " completely false			0
" adding to the chorus against @entity6 is outspoken @entity181 personality @entity179			1
he called @entity6 an " enabler of men who beat women " and demanded the commissioner resign or be fired			2
@entity187 sport columnist @entity186 agreed			0
" @entity6 should follow @entity1 out the door -- his leadership has no integrity and no longer can be trusted by the public			2
he should resign , " she wrote			0
in the reactions to the two cases , perhaps there 's a lesson in how the @entity8 and @entity3 handled them			1
much like on the court or on the field , a decisive hand running the team can blunt much of the criticism .			0

@entity3 and @entity8 commissioners have each faced *member* conduct *challenges* in 2014
@entity2 took over the @entity8 and immediately faced the @entity208 crisis
@entity6 has been the @entity3 boss for eight years .
there 's a growing chorus calling for @entity6 's resignation
