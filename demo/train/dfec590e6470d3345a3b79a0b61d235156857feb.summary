a video file posted online tuesday purports to relay a new message from @entity6 @entity5 hostage @entity3 : he and a captive @entity9 military pilot will be killed in the next 24 hours if @entity9 does n't release a convicted would - be suicide bomber			1
it is the second purported message from @entity12 in four days			0
if authentic , it is the first time @entity5 is publicly linking the fates of @entity12 and the captive @entity9 pilot , @entity15 , whom @entity5 captured after his jet crashed last month in @entity17			1
the latest file , posted to @entity19 and distributed on social media by known @entity5 supporters , appears to show a static image of @entity12 , alone , in handcuffs and wearing orange , holding a picture of who appears to be @entity15			1
over the image , a voice purporting to be @entity3 's restates saturday 's apparent @entity5 proposal : @entity3 would go free if @entity9 releases longtime prisoner @entity30			1
this time , it 's still a one - for - one swap , but now both the lives of @entity3 and the @entity9 pilot are threatened if it does n't go through			1
@entity1 can not independently verify the authenticity of tuesday 's message			0
" i 've been told this is my last message , and i 've also been told that the barrier obstructing my freedom is now just the @entity9 government delaying the handover of @entity45 , " the voice says in @entity38 in tuesday 's post			2
" tell the @entity6 government to put all the political pressure on @entity9			0
" " her for me -- a straight exchange , " the voice says			0
" any more delays by the @entity9 government will mean they are responsible for the death of their pilot , which will then be followed by mine			2
" i only have 24 hours left to live , and the pilot has even less			1
" the nearly two - minute video , posted tuesday morning @entity57 , makes no mention of releasing pilot @entity15 , even if @entity59 is released			0
the video is similar to a post from saturday , which alleged that @entity5 had killed a different @entity6 hostage , @entity63			1
saturday 's post shows a static image of @entity12 , holding what appears to be a photo of beheaded compatriot @entity68			1
a voice , purporting to be @entity3 's , says that @entity70 was killed because @entity6 had n't answered a previous @entity5 demand of $ 200 million for the @entity6 captives ' freedom			1
saturday 's voice also said that the captors no longer demanded money , but rather a @entity12 - for - @entity78 swap			2
@entity6 prime minister @entity79 said sunday that experts were analyzing saturday 's video , but that it seemed " highly credible			2
" @entity83 authorities said they had no reason to doubt its authenticity			0
abe on wednesday morning told reporters in @entity88 that he was angry about the ongoing situation			0
" under very severe circumstances , i instructed yet again that the government work together as one towards the immediate release of mr. @entity3 , " he said			2
@entity94 is an @entity96 woman facing the death penalty in @entity9 for her role in a series of bombings that killed dozens of people at hotels in the @entity104 kingdom in 2005			0
authorities said she tried to take part in the massacre , but her explosives failed			0
militants say they captured @entity110 , the @entity9 pilot , after he ejected from his crashing @entity112 last month , having taken part in @entity83 - led coalition airstrikes near @entity5 ' de-facto capital , @entity116 , @entity17			1
@entity9 is participating in an @entity83 - led mission against @entity5 , an organization seeking to establish a caliphate , or @entity120 , and has wrested territory spanning from central @entity17 to about 100 kilometers ( 62 miles ) north of @entity122			1
@entity3 , 47 , and @entity70 , 42 , had gone to the @entity124 for different reasons , the former is an experienced freelance journalist covering the conflict in @entity96 and @entity17 , and the latter an aspiring security contractor who felt at home in the war - torn region			0
they ended up in the hands of @entity5 in recent months			0
@entity1 's @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 contributed to this report .			0

@entity140 appears to show hostage @entity3 holding a photo of captive @entity9
@entity144 , purportedly @entity3 's , says he , @entity9 pilot will die in 24 hours if swap is n't made
