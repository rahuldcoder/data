-- did a " @entity6 special force " commit acts of " torture " and " murder " in @entity4 ? that suggestion came out of a meeting of the ruling @entity4 council led by president @entity10			1
@entity11 said monday it has found no evidence to support the allegations , which appeared in a statement sunday from @entity10 's office			1
" it became clear that armed individuals named as @entity6 special force stationed in @entity20 province engage in harassing , annoying , torturing and even murdering innocent people , " said the statement			1
it did n't indicate who identified the attackers as " @entity6 special force			1
" nine people " disappeared in an operation " recently by a " suspicious force " in @entity20 province , west of @entity31 , according to the statement from @entity10 's office			2
@entity20 is important because it 's often used as a main route for insurgents trying to gain access to @entity31			0
the statement also described an incident in which a student was taken from his home at night			0
his " tortured body with throat cut was found two days later under a bridge , " the statement said			0
" such actions have caused local public resentment and hatred , " said @entity10 's office			2
the shocking allegations follow months of @entity6 special operations raids that have deeply offended some @entity4 angry about foreigners entering their homes			1
@entity6 officials have said the raids are vital to @entity11 's operation against insurgents			1
the @entity6 military has said it is investigating and officials of @entity11 's @entity56 plan to hold talks about the allegations with @entity4 officials			1
a joint investigation will be conducted by a commission made up of @entity6 , @entity11 and @entity4 officials , @entity56 spokesman @entity60 told @entity0			1
" we have spent the day in discussions with the @entity4 government and agreed to a joint commission that will look into the concerns of the people of @entity20 , " he said			0
@entity56 said monday via @entity69 , " we will not start with the assumption that the allegations are true			0
we looked into the allegations " and " found no supporting evidence for them			2
" local officials told @entity0 the allegations came from residents in @entity20			2
@entity78 , a member of the local provincial council , told @entity0 that dozens of people complained to him and a visiting delegation from @entity31 about alleged attacks on civilians by " @entity6 special forces			1
" the delegation then reported it to @entity10 , @entity78 said			0
@entity11 's response came a day after the @entity4 government demanded that @entity88 leave @entity20 province			2
the @entity90 also said the @entity56 must stop all special forces operations in the province			0
" until we have a chance to speak with @entity4 officials , we ca n't comment further on the statements of yesterday , " @entity56 said monday			2
@entity78 told @entity0 that until recently , there had always been good coordination between the @entity6 and the @entity4			2
" but in the last several months this coordination had vanished and caused so many tensions including all these civilian causalities and complaints against them , " @entity78 said			0
@entity20 provincial spokesman @entity101 told @entity0 there have been " too many complaints against @entity6 special forces in different districts of the province			1
" another local official told @entity109 's order for @entity88 to leave the province may have helped to avoid more trouble			0
" if president @entity10 's had n't made the decision , the people of the province were planning big riots and they wanted to block the @entity121 and @entity122 highways , " said @entity112 , a resident of @entity20 's @entity114 district			0
" just a month ago @entity6 special forces blew up the gates of 12 houses in a single night and beat up 20 young men in @entity128 area of the province			0
" however , some @entity4 fear a @entity130 resurgence if there are no @entity6 special forces in the region			1
" in the last year @entity6 special forces destroyed almost 70 % of the @entity130 and other insurgents in @entity20 without causing any civilian casualties , " said an @entity4 political analyst in @entity20 who asked not to be identified , fearing retribution			1
" if the @entity6 special forces leave the province , i am sure that the province would completely fall into the hands of the insurgents in less than a year and that would definitely have a negative impact on the security in @entity31 and other neighboring provinces			0
" last april , the @entity6 and @entity4 signed a deal that effectively gave @entity4 authorities veto power over controversial special forces missions			0
the agreement prevents @entity56 from conducting such operations without the explicit permission of @entity4 officials , a senior @entity11 official said			1
@entity88 will operate under @entity4 law , said a statement from @entity10 's office			2
the complex system fully " afghanized " such operations , putting @entity4 commandos in the lead and giving @entity160 a " training and support role , " a senior @entity4 official said			0
under the deal , @entity88 would be on the ground but would not enter @entity4 homes unless specifically asked to do so by @entity4 commandos leading the operation , or by other @entity4 officials , a senior @entity11 official said			1
@entity0 's @entity171 reported this story from @entity4 , @entity0 's @entity170 reported from the @entity173 , @entity0 's @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 reported from @entity177 and @entity178 contributed to this report .			0
