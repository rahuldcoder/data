-- all big ideas start small , and @entity2 -- a wildly popular alternative urban band from @entity3 -- is no exception			1
its members , @entity2 , who goes by " @entity8 , " and @entity9 , " @entity9 , " are stepbrothers			1
when their parents divorced , @entity9 would visit @entity11 at his father 's house on 13th street , or @entity2			1
he was required to identify himself to enter , as either a resident , " residente " or visitor , " visitante , " in @entity16			0
" later , it took on another meaning , with the question of whether immigrants are residents or visitors , " said @entity11 , who along with @entity9 , recently sat down to talk with @entity0 en @entity19 's @entity18			1
" but that was how it started			0
" neither brother could have imagined then what @entity2 would become -- one of the most highly praised and talked - about groups to come out of @entity31 in years			2
it has won more than 20 @entity33 and moved beyond its reggaeton roots to include instruments and sounds from all over the region , winning critical and popular praise in the process			0
though raunchy , the group 's lyrics are often hard - hitting on social issues , and @entity11 is particularly well - known for being outspoken about poverty , @entity46 independence and education			1
asked how he views his career now , @entity11 said he 's matured and made some adjustments so that people can better hear and understand his message			1
" i liked to use bad words , " said @entity11 , who raps and writes the group 's lyrics			1
" because it seemed to me it gave a reality that 's missing in music			2
" " there are bad words in novels , in theater , in documentaries , at the movies			0
why ca n't they exist in music ? " " the problem , " he continued , " was that people were concentrating on the bad words and losing the message			2
" though he 'll still swear on records if the song calls for it , @entity11 says he uses expletives less now in the hope that his music will be able to reach a wider audience			1
to that end , @entity11 , who went to school at the @entity78 in @entity79 , @entity80 , said he plans to start writing lyrics in @entity83 and thinks he might live in @entity84 one day			2
his words are paired with music and beats created by @entity88			0
their younger sister , @entity89 , known as " @entity91 , " also performs with @entity2 sometimes			2
@entity9 describes the group 's sound as a mix of many influences			1
eclectic is a good word for it			0
in spite of the variety that 's out there , though , @entity9 told @entity102 's @entity101 that he thinks " we 're going through a bad time , the worst time in music			1
" " everything sounds the same on the radio , different producers doing the same work , " he said			0
" look -- we 're not making the best music in the world			0
but what we are making is sincere , and i think that 's worth something			0
" @entity0 's @entity115 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 and @entity9 , aka " @entity8 " and " @entity9 " recall their names ' origin
@entity11 lived on 13th street , or @entity2 , as a boy
