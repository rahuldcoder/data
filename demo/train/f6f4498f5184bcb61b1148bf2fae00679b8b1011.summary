@entity0 -- @entity3 's two presidential contenders continued to battle over the country 's undecided voters thursday , after sparring over the economy in their one head - to - head debate ahead of sunday 's runoff vote			1
in a combative televised debate wednesday night , president @entity9 and challenger @entity10 focused on the economy , social issues and immigration			1
but despite the trading of personal insults , neither landed a killer blow , leaving both candidates keen to seize the advantage in the last two days of campaigning			2
centrist candidate @entity21 announced thursday that he would vote for @entity10 , but urged his supporters to vote with their conscience			1
both candidates hope to pick up a share of the 9 % of votes that went to @entity21 in the first round			2
@entity9 , of the center - right @entity30 party , was to hold a rally in the southeastern city of @entity34 thursday , while @entity10 , of the center - left socialist party , addressed supporters in the southwestern city of @entity38			1
the economy and immigration have been at the heart of campaigning , with @entity3 struggling to overcome with low growth and 10 % unemployment			1
in his opening salvo wednesday night , @entity10 said he would be the president of unity , justice and recovery			1
" i want to unite all the @entity3			2
... it is in this way that we will recover our confidence , " he said			0
@entity9 's response was to highlight the imminent danger in which he sees the country			1
" we are not in a crisis , but among many crises , " he said			0
in a direct appeal to the country 's undecided voters , he then said : " unity is when we talk to the people of @entity3 , not just to the left			1
" he also accused @entity10 of favoring union members over the general public interest , and said with his opponent as president there would be " more taxes and more debt			1
" @entity10 in turn attacked @entity9 on divisions in the country , saying he has split the population			1
in one of several testy exchanges , he also accused @entity9 of cronyism			2
" you appointed your close colleagues everywhere , in all the ministries and regional government			0
if i understand correctly , you appointed them everywhere , " he said			0
in response , @entity9 , who is trailing in opinion polls , questioned his rival 's grasp on the truth			1
" can i finish my sentence ? what you are saying now is a lie			0
you are nothing but a little slanderer , " he said			0
accusations of dishonesty again came to the fore in another exchange			0
" what is extraordinary about your answers is that whatever happens in @entity3 , you are happy , although the @entity3 are clearly not , " @entity10 said			1
" what you are saying is a lie , " @entity9 responded			2
" when you say i do n't care about my responsibilities , that is a lie			0
" @entity10 , who in campaigning has sought to paint @entity9 as more interested in looking after a wealthy elite than the common people , stressed his own commitment to social justice			1
" i will be the president who believes in justice , because we are living through a difficult crisis , which is hitting those who work the hardest , who have less money , " @entity10 said			1
" i want justice to be the foundation of all the decisions that we make			0
" on immigration , @entity9 repeated his position that @entity3 has too many immigrants to be able to provide the necessary jobs and housing			1
" @entity3 is an open country ; i know myself where i am from			2
but we have welcomed in too many people , we have to reduce the number of those that we allow in , not because we do not love them , " he said			0
he said @entity3 has always had very generous social benefits but immigration should be halved			2
@entity10 agreed that economic immigration should limited , but was quick to say that @entity9 is responsible for higher rates of immigration to @entity3 over the past 10 years , as interior minister for five years before becoming president			1
the two rivals have been competing to reach out to the 6.5 million voters who supported the third - place candidate in the first round of voting , the right - wing @entity147 leader @entity146			0
in the april 22 balloting , @entity10 received 28.6 % of the vote , slightly ahead of @entity9 's 27.2 %			1
@entity150 , who has called for sharply curbing immigration , received 18 % of the vote			0
speaking to @entity1 affiliate @entity154 - tv thursday morning , @entity146 said : " i got the impression that ( @entity10 ) played his role as expected -- but of course you know perfectly well my fundamental opinions on socialism , and my total disagreement with it			2
" she added , " @entity9 was not clear in his strategy			2
we see that he has a strategy that is quite varied ... from day to day			0
we do n't know any more what his position is			0
" @entity150 said tuesday she would not back either candidate and would leave her voting slip blank on sunday			0
she told supporters to vote " with your soul and your conscience			1
" socialist party leader @entity177 praised @entity10 's performance in the debate			1
" he had the stature , he stayed on course , he knew where he was going , he held true to his values , " she told @entity3 network @entity180			0
" he put morality in the center of everything ... justice at the heart of @entity3 , and bringing together all of the @entity3 people			0
" @entity192 , of the @entity30 party , was equally appreciative of @entity9 's performance			1
the debate exposed the rivals ' very different characters , he told @entity180 , allowing voters to see " on one side , @entity9 , because of his maturity , his experience , of the competence of someone who for five years has carried on his shoulders and guided our country through a period of crisis , and @entity10 on the other side , hesitant , and naturally -- same as anyone who has difficulty with the subject -- arrogant			1
" wednesday 's debate was the only head - to - head encounter for the two rivals			0
@entity0 voter @entity216 , 57 , said she had already decided whom to back -- and the debate did n't change her mind			0
" they both stood their ground and i did n't hear anything new , and i do n't have the feeling that it did much for those who are still making their minds up about sunday 's vote , " she said			1
@entity227 , 26 , said he found the discussion of the economy unenlightening because it lacked depth			0
" i had the impression that both of them were lying , so it 's difficult to decide , " he said			0
" i do n't think there was a real winner in the debate and i do n't think it 's changed much for those who are still undecided			0
" far - left candidate @entity240 , who received about 11 % in the first round , will hold a rally in @entity0 friday			0
he has already urged his supporters to back @entity10			2
under @entity3 election rules , campaigning will end at midnight friday			2
