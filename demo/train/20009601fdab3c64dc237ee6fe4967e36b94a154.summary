@entity0 -- @entity2 backed president @entity4 's historic easing of decades - old sanctions against @entity6 on wednesday and said she is " deeply relieved " by the release of @entity10 contractor @entity8			1
@entity11 , who was secretary of state when @entity8 was arrested in 2009 , backed @entity4 in a statement wednesday night that was in stark contrast with her @entity15 counterparts in the field of potential 2016 presidential contenders			1
" i support president @entity4 's decision to change course on @entity6 policy , while keeping the focus on our principal objective -- supporting the aspirations of the @entity6 people for freedom , " @entity11 said in a statement			1
she called @entity8 's release " great news , " and noted that as secretary of state , she pushed for his release , stayed in contact with @entity8 's family and " called for a new direction in @entity6			1
" " despite good intentions , our decades - long policy of isolation has only strengthened the @entity44 regime 's grip on power , " @entity11 said			0
" as i have said , the best way to bring change to @entity6 is to expose its people to the values , information and material comforts of the outside world , " she said			0
" the goal of increased @entity10 engagement in the days and years ahead should be to encourage real and lasting reforms for the @entity6 people			2
and the other nations of the @entity57 should join us in this effort			0
" her comments largely echo @entity4 's remarks			2
but @entity62 , like @entity64 sen. @entity63 and former @entity64 gov. @entity65 , called the move to ease the two countries ' diplomatic strain a mistake , saying it would weaken the @entity10 ' negotiating position in pushing for democracy in the communist nation .			0
