-- in a historic decision this week , the @entity1 voted to boycott @entity4 academic institutions , endorsing @entity7 civil society 's call for boycotts , divestments and sanctions against @entity4 until it complies with international law and ends abuses against @entity7 human rights			1
the decision by the @entity1 , a group of academics involved in the study of @entity18 culture and history , to boycott collaborations with institutions is important			1
the @entity1 is one of the first major @entity18 academic groups to take this step , and it sends a strong message to @entity4 intellectuals and elites that their nation 's policies will lead only to international isolation			1
the @entity31 ( @entity32 ) was started by @entity7 political parties , trade unions and political movements in 2005			2
signatories include refugees , @entity7 in the occupied @entity7 territories and @entity7 citizens of @entity4			1
the legitimacy of the movement 's tactics comes into sharp focus in the light of @entity46 's death and the struggle in @entity48 against apartheid			1
today , @entity4 practices apartheid			1
it 's a system of unjust laws enforced by the gun to restrict the human rights of one group -- palestinians -- with the aim of keeping political power in the hands of another demographic group -- @entity4 jews			2
these violations of @entity7 ' rights include the denial of repatriation to refugees , restrictions on residency , the demolition of homes , destruction and seizure of land and property , restrictions on movement and discrimination in allocation of resources			1
many supporters of @entity4 are rehashing the same arguments against @entity32 that apologists of the @entity48 regime made decades ago			1
perhaps the most common criticism is that @entity4 is not the worst regime in the world -- boycotts based on human rights concerns should focus on the worst violators first and not unfairly single out @entity4			1
the same reasoning was made against the movement to divest from @entity48			2
two @entity92 professors argued in an op - ed in 1979 : " @entity94 have often been harsh in their dealings with black people but there is nothing like the mass terror characteristic of communist countries and of many @entity48 dictatorships			2
... in @entity48 , there has been nothing comparable to the mass expulsions of ethnic minorities that have stained the @entity107 history of countries as varied as @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117			2
" @entity48 may not have engaged in the bloodletting that happened in 1970s @entity116 , but does that mean other nations should not have risen up and acted against apartheid ? the authors of the op - ed say that blacks never had it as good as they do under apartheid			1
blacks in @entity48 , they wrote , are " among the best paid , best educated , most urbanized blacks in @entity48			2
" this classic colonialist trope is often unsurprisingly echoed by @entity4 's supporters , who argue that @entity7 under @entity4 rule are similarly privileged compared with their @entity131 kin			1
the effort to distract from @entity4 human rights abuses by pointing to human rights abuses elsewhere is simply aimed at silencing criticism of @entity4			2
the movement chooses boycotts , divestments and sanctions as a strategy in part because other strategies have proved fruitless			0
armed struggle has not worked			0
as in the case of @entity48 , a native , stateless population was pitted against a highly industrialized and militarized state that had the backing of western powers , and it led to bloody repression of @entity7			1
and negotiations have acted just as a cover for continued @entity4 colonization			0
the @entity4 use their position as the stronger party , backed by the @entity18 , to impose their will on the @entity7			1
if the @entity7 reject these unfair proposals , they are promptly blamed for the absence of peace despite being the occupied party			0
there is a second argument we 've heard in recent days against @entity32 and the vote of the @entity1			0
@entity166 chairman @entity165 -- when he was in @entity48 for @entity46 's memorial -- said he supports the boycott of @entity4 settlement products but not the boycott of the state of @entity4 itself			1
some reflexive @entity4 supporters jumped on this comment to argue that those who endorse the @entity32 movement are being " more @entity7 " than the chairman of the @entity166			1
it 's not very useful to boycott settlements in the occupied territories without boycotting the state that supports them			0
@entity4 's colonial enterprise is not directed from the hilltops of the @entity184 but from the corridors of power inside @entity4 's government			0
the state provides funding , defense and infrastructure to ensure @entity4 settlements grow and thrive			0
and , while settlements might be the biggest single challenge to @entity7 territorial contiguity , they are but one facet of a system of oppression that features a range of abuses from discrimination and displacement to denial of refugee rights			2
but it makes some sense that the chairman of the @entity166 would make such a remark			0
@entity165 , who leads the @entity208 , is engaged in @entity18 - led negotiations with @entity4			0
he relies heavily on @entity211 donor dollars to pay his employees and security services			0
that funding , in the past , has routinely been used as a coercive force any time @entity165 even moderately disagreed with @entity18 and @entity4 whims			0
this has compromised the independence of the @entity208 's decision making for years			0
if @entity165 came out in full support of @entity32 , he 'd immediately be accused of " incitement " by his @entity4 counterpart			0
he might even get a phone call from @entity18 secretary of state @entity225 reminding him who pays his bills			0
when understood in context , @entity165 ' comment is not a reflection of the broader @entity7 opinion on @entity32 but rather a product of the bankrupt @entity18 - led negotiations system that makes boycotts , divestment and sanctions so necessary			1
@entity32 is growing , but at only 8 years old , it 's still a nascent movement			0
victories are piling up , however , and this path continues to be the most likely method of putting pressure on @entity4 to end its version of apartheid			2
years from now , we will look back at moments , such as the @entity1 's decision , just as we can look back today on the 1979 argument against fighting @entity48 apartheid			1
and we 'll remember who chose to be on the right side of history			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity254 .			0
