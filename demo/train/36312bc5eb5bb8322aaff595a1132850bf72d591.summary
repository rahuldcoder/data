-- what is president @entity2 up to ? when it comes to immigration , it 's usually no good			1
after all , this is the same president who ran for re-election packaged as a kinder and gentler alternative to cold - hearted @entity10 who wanted illegal immigrants to " self deport " while , back at the ranch , the @entity12 was removing illegal immigrants 24/7 at a record pace			1
in the 2012 fiscal year that ended september 30 , an unprecedented 409,849 people were deported			1
this was an increase from the previous year and it occurred despite policy changes -- i.e. , those spelled out in the march 2011 memo by @entity24 director @entity23 urging prosecutorial discretion -- that were supposedly going to limit removals to hardened criminals			0
in four years , the administration has removed a record 1.5 million illegal immigrants			1
and while administration officials may insist that many of them were guilty of felonies and thus less sympathetic , they leave out that under current law , a nanny or gardener who is deported and simply re-enters the country is a felon			0
but there are two bright spots in @entity2 's immigration record			1
last summer , the @entity41 announced a policy change that lets undocumented young people avoid deportation by applying for deferred action and two - year work permits			1
and last month , in a much more obscure change , the administration said it would ease requirements to help undocumented immigrants who seek permanent residency and must return to their home countries to do so			1
these folks currently have to wait up to 10 years outside the @entity54 before being able to legally re-enter			0
but there is a waiver that gives them permission to return to the @entity54 sooner if their @entity54 - based families would suffer an extreme hardship from the separation			0
under the change , immigrants can remain in the @entity54 while applying for that waiver			2
now @entity2 wants to go further			1
according to the @entity66 , @entity2 plans to finally make good on a 2008 campaign promise and push @entity68 in the next few months to move quickly on comprehensive immigration reform			1
his plan , which he is expected to unveil in the @entity71 on february 12 , includes a path to citizenship for most of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the @entity54			1
opinion : dispel the immigration myths it wo n't be easy			2
for one thing , there is the politics			2
as immigration reform advocates have learned over the last 12 years , there is no magic formula			1
from 2001 to 2007 , @entity10 controlled the @entity41 and both houses of @entity68 ; from 2009 to 2011 , it was @entity86 who controlled both ends of @entity89			0
and either time , nothing got done on immigration			2
and there is always a deal breaker			0
in 2005 - 2007 , the last time that @entity68 took up this debate , the big obstacle was guest workers			0
republicans insisted on language that would have brought in a few hundred thousand guest workers to do jobs that @entity54 are n't doing			0
under pressure from labor unions , @entity86 objected			0
the result was a stalemate			0
this time , the major sticking point is likely to be citizenship			2
democrats , including @entity2 , have said they wo n't budge on their demand that undocumented immigrants get not just legal status , but also a pathway to citizenship			1
the @entity116 brand is so toxic with @entity118 immigrants right now that we could be talking about millions of new @entity86 voters , which is precisely why the @entity116 wo n't go along with immigration reform if a direct path to citizenship is in the mix. as for whether it should be , i do n't think so			1
here are three reasons why not : -- illegal immigrants do n't care about citizenship nearly as much as politicians do			1
their concerns are practical , not ideological			0
they want driver 's licenses , the freedom to go to work without living under the threat of being picked up and deported and the ability to go back and forth between the @entity54 and their home country ; -- as long as @entity10 are dead - set against citizenship , we 'll never get a deal on immigration reform because -- unlike the health care debate -- this issue does n't unite @entity86			1
many of those in the @entity147 and @entity148 remain adamantly opposed to legalizing the undocumented			2
so without @entity116 votes , it 's back to square one ; and -- @entity54 citizenship is something special , and it has great value			2
it ought not to be bartered away in a round of horse - trading			0
by all means , those who are legalized should be allowed to become citizens , but only by their own effort and on their own steam			2
there should not be a roadblock to citizenship , but nether does there need to be a direct pathway			2
opinion : both parties must lead on immigration politicians always play the same game when it comes to immigration			2
@entity86 ask for the moon and stars , and the @entity10 go into orbit			0
they want away from the table , and democrats do n't have the votes to do anything without them			0
each side blames the other			0
back to the drawing board			0
the status quo is preserved			0
see you in 10 years			0
but , when that happens , the people who lose are the very ones who many people say they want to help -- those 11 million undocumented immigrants who live in the @entity54 and contribute to our economy			1
they 're caught in suspended animation , not belonging to one country or another			0
they deserve a pathway to legal status , and a final resolution to a debate that really is n't as difficult as some make it			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			1

@entity208 : immigration reform on @entity2 agenda , but deportations are his main record
@entity2 also allowed deferred action for young people ; eased re-entry rules
politics over path to citizenship will stall reform again ; why not take it out of the mix , he says
@entity208 : undocumented immigrants , who help economy , deserve path to legal status
