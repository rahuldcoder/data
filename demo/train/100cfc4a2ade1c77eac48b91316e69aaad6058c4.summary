the twister was hurtling straight toward her			1
it was one of two apparent tornadoes that ripped through the area friday			1
@entity1 jumped in his car and furiously drove the three miles from his home to the school			1
in his read view mirror , he could see four police cars			2
but they were n't chasing him			2
they were also charging towards to the school and the sitting targets within			2
@entity1 arrived to a surreal scene wrought by the fury of the storm			1
his heart skipped a few beats			2
he was one of thousands of @entity31 unnerved friday by a swath of severe weather that extended from @entity34 to @entity35			2
inside the school , it was hot , damp and dark -- the power was out			1
the staff had gone into storm mode at about 8:45 in the morning , huddling the students in the safest place of all , the hallway , @entity1 said			1
@entity3 was huddled with her classmates			1
she could feel her frightened friend 's clawing into her arm			1
everyone knew the tornado coming their way , like a killer approaching a helpless victim			0
@entity3 was 20 feet away from the door and could feel the wind forcing its way underneath			1
it was so strong that even through the cracks , it made her hair fly			0
" we did n't know if it was going to bust open at any minute , " she said			0
