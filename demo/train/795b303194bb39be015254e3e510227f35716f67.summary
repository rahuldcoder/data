-- we 're all familiar with @entity3 's love affair for thin devices			2
although the third - generation ipad surprised many by gaining about half a millimeter of thickness , it looks like @entity3 could be back to trimming product dimensions by using a new kind of display technology in the next @entity12			1
instead of using a display comprising a number of separate layers , @entity3 could use in - cell touch display technology , according to a friday report from @entity19			1
the report says @entity3 would be sourcing its in - cell displays from @entity22 and @entity23			1
" the advantage of in - cell is that you 're streamlining the manufacturing process , so in time you should be able to drive efficiencies and reduce cost , " @entity25 analyst @entity24 told @entity0			2
" additionally , by reducing the number of layers , you reduce the size and thickness of the device , making it thinner and lighter			0
" if the @entity12 has a larger 4 - to 4.3 - inch display , as some reports expect it to , that extra glass could add a bit of heft to the @entity12 's weight			0
thus , @entity3 would need to find new ways to keep the phone from gaining too much weight			0
currently , the @entity12 's " on cell " display is layered a bit like a sandwich ( or if you 're feeling like dessert , think of a trifle )			0
at the very bottom , you 've got the back light			0
directly above that , the lcd section , which houses the red - , green - , and blue - colored pixels of the display			2
then there 's a layer of glass			0
on top of that is the capacitive touch layer , which is then topped off by a tough layer of @entity66			0
the middle layer of glass separates the liquid crystal portion of the display from the touch portion			2
in - cell display tech eliminates that middle layer of glass , combining the lcd and touch sections of the display into a single layer			1
one way this can be successfully accomplished is by " multiplexing " the electrodes normally used to relay touch input -- that is , using the same electrodes to handle the signals for both touch control and the pixels of the lcd , according to a 2010 @entity25 report on touch - screen displays			1
in - cell technology is n't currently deployed in any shipping cellphones			1
and it should n't be confused with the similar - sounding " @entity94 " technologies from @entity93			0
@entity96 and @entity94 lcd screens use on - cell technology rather than in - cell			1
right now , in - cell touch displays are still an emerging technology			1
so while the core technology promises long - term benefits , yield rates could be a problem in the shorter terms , @entity101 says			0
but that 's the deal with any new technological process , is n't it ? in the months before the new @entity112 was announced , yield rates for @entity3 's retina display were a huge question mark			2
so is in - cell really something @entity3 would pull the trigger on ? " we do believe that the next @entity12 display will implement in - cell touch , " @entity115 's @entity114 told @entity0 via e-mail			1
but of course , we 'll have to wait and see how it pans out when the next @entity12 actually debuts subscribe to @entity0 for less than $ 1 an issue and get a free gift ! click here ! copyright 2011 @entity128 .			0

new " in - cell " tech combines lcd and touch sections of phones ' display into a single layer

in - cell technology is n't currently deployed in any cellphones but could make them thinner
