-- @entity1 has found cracks in large pylons that hold engines onto the wings of two of its 767 - 300 aircraft , according to the airline and to the planes ' manufacturer			1
concerned the problem may exist on other airline fleets , @entity12 says it plans to advise airlines to inspect the parts more frequently than the current recommendation of every 1,500 takeoff and landing cycles			1
" this is considered a safety issue			0
you 're talking about the strut that connects an engine to the wing , " said @entity12 spokesperson @entity20			2
@entity1 spokesman @entity25 said the problem was first discovered on one of its 767 - 300s about two weeks ago during a maintenance check targeting other parts of the aircraft			1
the airline then found cracking on one more 767 - 300 after inspecting a total of 56 aircraft -- 767 - 300 and 767 - 200s -- a process @entity1 completed monday night			1
" we found these issues when it 's best to find them , which is early on , " said @entity25			0
the airline has sent the first damaged pylon to a metallurgy lab to try to determine why it cracked			0
" until that metallurgy testing is completed no one knows what the cause is , " said @entity25			0
the damaged planes were among @entity51 's older aircraft , @entity25 added			0
@entity51 flies @entity12 767 - 300s on international routes as well as long - haul domestic routes			1
the 767 - 200s fly primarily transcontinental routes			2
airlines have previously found similar cracks at the holes where the pylon attaches to the wing , which led @entity12 and the @entity62 five years ago to recommend checks every 1,500 cycles			2
at that time , when the @entity62 issued an airworthiness directive it said , " we are issuing this ( directive ) to prevent fatigue cracking in the primary strut structure and reduced structural integrity of the strut , which could result in separation of the strut and engine			0

@entity12 plans to advise airlines to inspect the parts more frequently
