the @entity1 government continues to shrink its ranks of @entity4 detainees , announcing saturday that four more have been repatriated -- this time to @entity5			1
the @entity6 identified them as @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11			0
the @entity14 @entity13 carrying them arrived in @entity5 around 6 a.m. saturday ( 10 p.m. et friday ) , @entity6 spokesman lt. colonel @entity12 told @entity16			1
an administration official told @entity16 the four detainees are not expected to face further detainment in @entity5			2
in a statement , the @entity1 @entity20 in @entity21 expressed appreciation to the @entity5 government -- which , since september , has been led by president @entity25 -- " for helping to reintegrate these former detainees			1
" " we have full confidence in the @entity5 government 's ability to mitigate any threats these individuals may pose and to ensure that they are given humane treatment , " the embassy said			2
the move was also made to further president @entity36 's goal of drawing down the number of those held at the @entity1 naval base in southeastern @entity40 , something that has been ongoing for years			2
" this repatriation reflects the @entity6 's continued commitment to closing the detention facility at @entity4 in a responsible manner , " said @entity42 , the @entity6 's special envoy for the closure of @entity4			1
132 now being held at @entity4 the departures of these four @entity5 men means that , as of saturday , 132 people are still detained at @entity4			1
this is down significantly from the numbers soon after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , when the facility widely known as @entity55 was repurposed to hold detainees from the " war on terror			2
" the administration of then - president @entity59 claimed that , since @entity55 detainees were n't held on @entity1 soil , they could be considered " enemy combatants " and be denied some legal protections			1
almost all of the nearly 800 detainees were held without charges			1
@entity68 torture report restarts fight on terror policy this legal limbo , as well as allegations of torture and other mistreatment , spurred criticism of @entity55			2
shortly after his 2009 inauguration , president @entity36 signed an executive order to close the detention facility within a year			0
some worry ex-detainees will engage in terrorism that did n't happen			0
one reason was because of strong opposition from lawmakers , many of them @entity84 , who cited the risk of freeing men who had fought to kill @entity1			2
about 17 % of the 620 @entity55 detainees released -- most of them during @entity59 's presidency -- went on to engage in terrorist activities , a september semiannual report from the director of national intelligence found			2
another 12 % are suspected of having engaged in terrorist or insurgent activities			0
still , the number of detainees has steadily gone down , including six transferred to the government of @entity97 earlier this month			0
four of these were @entity99 , one was @entity100 and the sixth was @entity102 , according to rear adm. @entity103 , press secretary for the @entity6			0
@entity97 president @entity104 said on his website december 5 , " we have offered our hospitality for humans suffering a heinous kidnapping in @entity4 (			0
) the unavoidable reason is humanitarian			0
" @entity1 transfers 6 @entity55 detainees to @entity97 @entity113 chairman @entity112 , @entity114 , said this and other releases by @entity36 's administration are dangerous , claiming many nations that receive former detainees are n't up for the job and that these countries do n't stop them from rejoining the fight			1
" we knew that was going to happen , " @entity112 told @entity16			0
" that 's why those of us who were trying to do the review of this were so concerned , because they were so interested in getting them out , that they forgot to do the due diligence -- i think -- that would allow them to at least protect those that were going to go back into the fight , from getting back into the fight			0
" embassy : transfer shows @entity1 supports reconciliation while they came from many countries , many @entity4 detainees were captured during the @entity1 - led military fight against @entity146 and its @entity148 allies in @entity5			1
it 's been rare for them to be sent back there , especially given some diplomatic discord and concerns about the country 's security situation			0
the @entity1 military 's future in @entity5 had been uncertain , too , amid contentious talks involving former president @entity158			1
the countries signed a security agreement soon after @entity25 took office			0
while the @entity1 military wo n't participate in combat operations in @entity5 , some @entity1 troops will remain there into 2015 and beyond as part of the deal			1
the @entity1 @entity20 in @entity21 expressed hope that the latest transfer can mark " a step forward in strengthening relations between the two countries and can provide an opportunity for greater confidence among @entity5 to engage in political dialogue to end the violence in their country			1
" the statement backed an " @entity5 - led reconciliation " that includes " all opposition groups , including the @entity148			0
" " as part of the outcome of any reconciliation process , the @entity148 and other armed groups must end violence , break ties with ( @entity146 ) and accept @entity5 's constitution , including its protections for women and minorities , " the embassy said			1
" this transfer demonstrates @entity1 support for such a reconciliation process			0
