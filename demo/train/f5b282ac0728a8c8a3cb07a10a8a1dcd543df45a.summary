-- a @entity2 python slithering through the @entity3 proved that her eyes were n't bigger than her stomach , swallowing intact a 76 - pound deer			1
at 15.65 feet , the python is n't the largest on record			1
but the size of her prey both impresses and concerns state and federal wildlife scientists and land managers trying to control the non-native species			1
" they are large exotic animals that are not naturally from this area , " said @entity18 , spokesperson for the @entity19			1
" the potential to wreak havoc on the natural @entity27 wildlife ... they do n't have true enemies			2
" contractors spraying exotic vegetation thursday came across the female python on an island about 20 miles from @entity33 , @entity18 told @entity0 tuesday			1
it was dispatched , by protocol , with a single shotgun blast to the head			2
a necropsy conducted by @entity33 wildlife biologists showed the python had a girth of 44.1 inches after devouring the adult female deer			1
the snake normally weighed 139 pounds			2
officials tuesday said they are trying to determine the age and health of the deer			1
" we see them on a regular basis , " @entity18 said of pythons			2
" we 've dispatched hundreds of these in the past few years			2
" the menu for @entity2 , rock and @entity54 pythons includes rodents , birds or smaller snakes			0
in 2005 , a python apparently busted its gut after it had consumed a 6 - foot alligator			0
some of the snakes may have escaped enclosures after @entity63 's widespread destruction in 1992			0
but there 's a more likely cause for the problem			0
" obviously , some of these were pets , " @entity18 said			0
when people realize they are going to grow up to be much larger than they expected , they often release the creatures into the wild			0
that 's the worst thing you can do , officials said			0
management and park officials have tried trapping , but that 's largely failed			0
scientists and park managers are studying the exotic reptiles ' breeding habits and pinpointing their locations to devise a strategy for controlling them			1
" it 's not meant to be successful in this habitat , " @entity87 , spokeswoman for @entity33 , said of the @entity2 python			1
" we do n't have any idea how many there are			0
this is the biggest ( one ) we have ever dealt with			0
" the giant reptiles compete with alligators and crocodiles			1
although pythons have been found in or near some residential areas west of @entity101 , there have been no reports of injuries to people , @entity18 said			0
@entity105 said invasive fish species , such as walking catfish and lionfish , are an even bigger problem in southern @entity27			1
@entity0 's @entity110 contributed to this report .			0
