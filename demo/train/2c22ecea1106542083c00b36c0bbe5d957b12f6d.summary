@entity4 , as the @entity1 jihadists in @entity2 and @entity3 are known , has become the new face of international terrorism in the eyes of the @entity8 and its @entity10 allies			1
now the focus in @entity8 and abroad has become what will president @entity12 and other leaders do about it ? here are key questions on the matter : 1 ) who killed @entity19 ? @entity21 's ambassador to the @entity8 , @entity20 , told @entity22 on sunday that @entity21 officials were close to identifying the @entity4 militant who beheaded @entity19 , an @entity8 journalist captured in @entity3 in 2012			1
he could n't elaborate on the identity of the killer , who is seen decapitating @entity19 in a video posted last week on @entity28			0
" we 're putting a great deal into the search , " he said , referring to the use of sophisticated technology to analyze the man 's voice			0
in the video , @entity19 , 40 , is seen kneeling next to a man dressed in black , who speaks with what experts say is a distinctly @entity41 accent			0
linguists said that based on his voice , the man sounds to be younger than 30			0
he also appears to have been educated in @entity41 from a young age and to be from southern @entity41 or @entity45			0
@entity21 close to identifying @entity19 's killer , ambassador says 2 ) will the @entity8 expand air strikes to @entity4 targets in @entity3 ? pressure is increasing on @entity12 to go after @entity4 in both @entity2 and @entity3 , ignoring an essentially non-existent border between them			1
last week , defense secretary @entity53 and joint chiefs chairman gen. @entity54 said that taking on @entity4 in @entity3 was the only way to defeat the @entity57 jihadists			1
for @entity12 , the step would reverse his refusal for three years to get involved militarily in @entity3 despite pressure from his own advisers , including former secretary of state @entity63			1
@entity12 " has not made any decision to order military action in @entity3 , " @entity65 spokesman @entity64 said monday , but the speculation and insistence continued			1
" the @entity65 is trying to minimize the threat we face in order to justify not changing a failed strategy , " conservative @entity71 sen. @entity70 of @entity72 said monday			2
@entity22 national security analyst @entity77 said it will be difficult to defeat @entity4 without ground forces , something @entity12 clearly opposes			1
intervening in @entity3 also could result in some strange geopolitical bedfellows , he noted			2
" two of the most effective fighting forces in @entity3 are @entity85 or @entity85 splinter groups , or groups like @entity87 , backed by @entity88 , " @entity77 said			2
" so if you intervene , you may be helping @entity88 and @entity87 and ( @entity3 president @entity91 's ) regime			2
" @entity12 already sent military advisers to @entity2 and launched air strikes to protect them and minority groups from @entity4 fighters rampaging through the country 's north			1
is @entity12 heading toward airstrikes in @entity3 ? a @entity65 spokesman said last week that @entity12 would consult with @entity100 before taking such a step in @entity3			1
the president also would seek to forge a coalition including regional allies as well as @entity107 and @entity108 support , officials have made clear			0
@entity71 urge airstrikes in @entity3 to defeat @entity4 3 ) will the @entity3 regime that @entity12 opposes help fight @entity4 ? @entity12 wants @entity91 out of power , but now the @entity3 leader engaged in a civil war against a @entity8 - backed opposition is offering to help him take on @entity4			1
foreign minister @entity115 said monday his government would accept support from the @entity8 and others working under the @entity107 umbrella to fight " terrorists " -- a code word for the group that calls itself the @entity1 and seeks to establish a caliphate across a @entity57 - dominated swath of the the @entity125			2
@entity115 , however , warned against any unilateral action or strikes in @entity3 territory without its permission , saying " any effort to fight terrorism should be done in coordination " with the " @entity3 government			2
" last week , @entity135 senior fellow and @entity3 expert @entity134 said a @entity8 rescue mission for @entity19 earlier this year that went into @entity3 but failed to find him established the precedent for military action across the @entity2 border , superseding any legal considerations such as being asked by the host government to enter			1
" the sort of legal barrier that prohibited doing something inside @entity3 now seems to have evaporated , " @entity134 said			0
the @entity3 offer to help fight @entity4 comes after @entity91 's government enabled the group to expand amid the @entity3 civil war			1
@entity4 fighters have attacked the @entity3 opposition fighting government forces , but also have seized some government territory			2
@entity154 's military recently launched its own air strikes on @entity4 positions , amounting to what @entity134 described as a dispute between crime gangs over money -- in this case , from oil fields occupied by @entity4			1
@entity3 ready to cooperate with @entity107 to fight terror 4 ) will isis attack the @entity164 ? to some in the @entity8 , especially critics of @entity12 , an @entity4 attack on @entity8 interests and even the homeland is a question of when , not if			1
" @entity4 is a very powerful local organization , and probably a reasonably powerful regional terrorist organization , " former @entity172 chief @entity171 told @entity22 on sunday			0
" but it 's one that has global ambitions -- and it has the tools			0
" there 's no clear consensus inside the intelligence community as to whether @entity4 , which calls itself the @entity1 , is currently capable of striking the @entity164			0
" it 's expressed the intent , " @entity171 said			0
" there 's no more powerful way to express their street credentials among the jihadist community than a successful attack against the @entity164			0
" @entity70 , a consistent advocate for increased @entity8 military might , told @entity22 on sunday that " it 's about time now to assume the worst about these guys , rather than to be underestimating them			1
" @entity4 threat to the @entity164 5 ) can the @entity4 money flow be stopped ? bank robbery , kidnapping , smuggling , selling oil on the black market -- @entity4 gets money to fund and expand its organization in all kinds of ways			2
officials say the group can get about $ 3 million a day by selling discounted oil from fields it has seized in @entity2			0
it also has grabbed millions robbing banks including an @entity2 central bank in @entity207			0
western allies can reduce the group 's income by refusing to pay ransom for abducted citizens and pressuring regional governments to crack down on wealthy citizens sending money to it			0
the @entity8 is working with governments in the region , including @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223 , to stop such private donations , @entity218 spokeswoman @entity217 said last week			0

@entity65 : president @entity12 has not decided on air strikes in @entity3
possible *options* include air strikes on @entity4 targets in @entity3
some consider the group a direct threat to @entity8 security
@entity12 spent three years *avoiding* a @entity8 military role in @entity3
