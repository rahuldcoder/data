-- four pings and an oil slick			1
that 's what the search for @entity5 has yielded so far			2
no signs of wreckage , no assurances of exactly where the plane might be			2
so officials are launching their next option : an underwater vehicle to scan the ocean floor			1
but even that vehicle -- the @entity17 -- faces plenty of challenges in finding the plane carrying 239 people			1
how does the underwater vehicle work ? the @entity17 is a probe equipped with side - scan sonar , or acoustic technology that creates pictures from the reflections of sound instead of light			1
the device sends a pulse that produces a three - dimensional map of the seafloor , according to the @entity34			1
an operator on the surface programs the vehicle , which is owned and operated by @entity38 , a marine services contractor			1
" when it reaches the appropriate depth , it will turn on its sensors , " said @entity39 , the president and ceo of manufacturer @entity41			2
" it will then run what 's called the lawn mower pattern , which is a series of parallel lines or tracks , where it will go back and forth just like mowing your lawn			2
" where will it be launched ? the @entity17 will be launched in the most probable area of the pings that were detected by the @entity58 ship @entity57			1
from there , it will plunge to a depth of 4,000 to 4,500 meters ( 2.5 miles ) -- roughly 35 meters above the ocean floor , the @entity34 said			0
" it operates at a height above the bottom optimized for its sensors , " @entity39 said			0
how fast and how far will the vehicle go ? the @entity17 's first mission will cover about 40 square kilometers ( 3.1 miles by 4.9 miles )			1
it 'll probably take anywhere from six weeks to two months to scan the entire search area , the @entity34 said			1
that 's because the vehicle crawls at the pace of a leisurely stroll , said @entity73 , an oceanographer from @entity74 who was chief scientist for the @entity75			1
but the @entity17 does create good images -- so good that they are " almost a picture of what 's there ... but it 's imaged with sound instead of with a camera			1
" what kind of terrain will it have to deal with ? the bottom of the search area is not sharply mountainous -- it 's more flat and almost rolling , @entity58 chief search coordinator @entity89 said			0
but he said the bottom of the area probably has a lot of silt , which can " complicate " the search			0
@entity89 cautioned against beliefs that the underwater vehicle will find wreckage			1
" it may not , " he said			0
" this will be a slow and painstaking process			0
" when can we learn what the @entity17 sees ? the vehicle has a 24 - hour cycle , so it can be deployed only once a day			1
and no information will be available until the end of each cycle , @entity89 said			0
it will take two hours for the @entity17 to get down to the search area			1
then it will scour the ocean bed for 16 hours and take another two hours to resurface			0
after that , it will take another four hours to download and analyze the data collected , @entity89 said			0
" the rate of information flow is certainly going to be a little bit more than a day apart , " @entity114 said			0
what happens after the pingers die ? what happens if and when debris is found ? once the debris field is found , other equipment -- such as remotely operated vehicles -- would be brought in to recover the black boxes , @entity122 said			1
rovs working at depths of 3 miles would require power conveyed down a cable from a ship above , said			0
" there are not many pieces of equipment in the world able to do this			2
" and only a handful of countries have manned submarines capable of descending to such depths -- such as the @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 , she said			0
why have n't they found any debris yet ? it 's actually not that surprising , said @entity0 aviation analyst @entity150 , author of " @entity151			2
" the model used for tracking the debris could be incorrect , @entity150 said			2
he said that was the case when investigators were searching for evidence of @entity156 , which plunged into the southern @entity157 in 2009 , killing all 228 people aboard			0
" they spent weeks looking for debris in the wrong area , " he said			2
the lack of debris could also mean that the plane did not break apart on impact , but instead sank largely intact , he said			2
if that was the case , it could complicate the effort to retrieve the black boxes , since they were stored inside the tail of the plane			1
investigators would have to dismantle the tail in order to extract them and whatever secrets they may hold			0
we heard pings last week			2
will the towed pinger locators be used again ? probably not			2
the plane 's black boxes were expected to ping for only about 30 days , and monday marks day 38 of the search			1
the towed pinger locator and the @entity17 are hosted by the same @entity58 ship , and only one device at a time can search underwater , @entity89 said			1
and because no new pings had been detected in the past six days , officials have pulled up the pinger locator in order to send down the unmanned vehicle			1
@entity89 said it 's unlikely the pinger locator will rejoin the search			1
what do we know about the oil slick ? on sunday night , the @entity58 ship @entity57 found an oil slick about 5.5 kilometers ( 3.4 miles ) downwind from where the pings were detected			1
a 2 - liter sample was collected for analysis			0
but it could take a few days to transfer that sample to a task force ship , bring it closer to shore , send it by helicopter to @entity210 , @entity58 , and then take it to a lab , @entity203 capt. @entity202 said			0
will the mystery of flight 370 be solved once the data recorders are found ? not necessarily			0
the voice recorders retain only the last two hours of recordings			0
and , since officials believe @entity5 flew almost seven hours beyond the point where something went terribly wrong , crucial data have almost certainly been erased			0
on the positive side , the depletion of the battery will not wipe out data			0
data has been known to survive years in harsh sea water conditions on modern recorders			0
interactive : the search for @entity5 @entity0 's @entity229 , @entity230 and @entity231 contributed to this report .			0

searchers are sending a vehicle underwater to scan the seafloor
if it finds debris , other equipment would go down to fetch the black boxes
the @entity17 crawls at the pace of a walk and has 40 square kilometers to cover
the pinger locator has been pulled up after no new pings have been detected
