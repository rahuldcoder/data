the letters , which @entity7 sent to her then - boyfriend at @entity24 in the late 1940s , were valued between $ 25,000 and $ 35,000 prior to the auction , held thursday morning , @entity19 said			1

" the buyer bought it over the phone , and they just wanted to be identified as a @entity18 lady who is a very big fan of @entity7 , " @entity19 told @entity0			1
" it 's always great when a piece of art goes for the estimate , but when something goes much higher than the estimate , it 's a great surprise			0
" the letters reveal the personality of the future first lady on the matters of adolescent love , kissing and a loathing of attending a finishing school			1
the auction house described the writings as " the earliest @entity7 letters , " displaying " a funny , spirited , at times cynical young woman , but one with great intelligence and a strong will of her own			1
" in a letter dated october 10 , 1946 , the 17 - year - old @entity52 reveals her " cooling enthusiasm " in a letter to @entity24 boyfriend @entity55 , " who seems to have been badly hurt when @entity7 refused to kiss him during one visit , " according to @entity8			1

@entity55 's son , @entity61 , of @entity21 , owned the letters and put them up for auction , he told @entity0			2
" i do love you though -- and can love you without kissing you every time i see you and i hope you understand that , " @entity7 declares			1
then , on january 20 , 1947 , she writes to her boyfriend about her definition of true love			2
" i 've always thought of being in love as being willing to do anything for the other person -- starve to buy them bread and not mind living in @entity74 with them -- and i 've always thought that every minute away from them would be hell -- so looking at it that ( way ) i guess i 'm not in love with you , " @entity7 writes			2
her last letter to him is undated , and it announces her engagement to @entity85			0
" what i hope for you , " she writes @entity55 , " is for the same thing to happen as quickly and as surely as it did with me			0
it will when you least expect it			0
" but that ill - fated engagement to @entity85 lasted only a few months in 1951 , according to @entity8			0
@entity7 died in 1994 in @entity21 as one of the world 's most famous women			2

@entity55 died in 2004 at age 79 , according to the social security death index			0
the 75 pages of letters were written between 1945 and 1951 on personal stationery and the letterhead of @entity108 , but in the letters , @entity7 calls @entity111 's finishing school " prison			1
" " if school days are the happiest of your life , i 'm hanging myself with my skip - rope tonight , " the teenage @entity7 writes to her boyfriend			1
in another letter , she pens of an upcoming @entity120 break , when " i can commute happily back and forth between my doting parents until they both get sick of me			0
" in an october 3 , 1946 , letter , she jokes about her schooling			0
" i 'm never going to send my children to boarding school , " she writes			0
" the boys can go to @entity127 with gangsters , and then go to @entity129 & the girls can go to @entity131 and they 'll all be morons but at least they wont have to tear around and get their teeth knocked out playing hockey every day			0
... can you think of anything worse than living in a small town like this all your life and competing to see which housewife could bake the best cake ? " the finishing school was in @entity143 , @entity144 , a town where @entity55 had resided at one time , a @entity8 's spokeswoman said			0
@entity7 displays a mischievous side in a february 12 , 1947 , letter in which she tells @entity55 to smuggle in cigarettes , chocolate " and a hip flask to shock mrs. @entity150 " many of the letters begin with " @entity154 " or " @entity155 , " and one envelope , sent via " air mail " with three 3 - cent stamps , is addressed to " mr. @entity55 " of " @entity159 " at @entity24			1
