-- twenty - five - year - old @entity2 @entity1 graduated with honors from college , where he was a football standout			1
he told us he goes to church regularly and is not involved in gangs or drugs			0
by any objective standard , there is no reason for police to be bothering him			0
but he says they are a constant presence in his life			0
this summer , he recorded an interaction on his cell phone camera			0
" get inside , and get the f -- k out of there ! " the video begins , with a uniformed cop cursing from his cruiser as @entity1 and a friend shelter from the rain at the entrance of his grandmother 's housing development waiting for a ride to their boxing gym			1
" why are you talking to me like that ? " @entity1 asks incredulously			0
" get inside , " the cop repeats again , walking toward them and kicking open the door to the building , " or i 'll handcuff you			0
" " i 'm not even doing anything			0
" " get inside , now ! " most @entity41 know about what happened to @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45			1
and many know about the choke hold death of @entity48 by police in @entity50 , @entity2			1
grand juries are reviewing evidence in both cases and we could soon learn if there will be criminal charges against the officers involved			2
but between these and other high profile cases are the invisible daily struggles of blacks like @entity1 who live and work in what police departments across the nation identify as " high - crime " communities , and are policed with the assumption of criminality			1
@entity1 's video did n't go viral or make the nightly news because the cop did n't beat , arrest or kill him , fortunately			2
but it 's regular interactions like these that are sending a message that your rights matter less to the police when you 're black			2
these and more invasive kinds of persistent police interactions fueled a landmark lawsuit in @entity2 , which resulted in an unprecedented ruling against the @entity84 , ordering it to amend its " stop and frisk " practice			1
they also helped lead to the election of a reform - minded mayor in the city			2
but nearly a year into @entity95 's first term , we were told countless times during our reporting for this film that qualitatively little has changed in the relationship between minorities and the police			1
and though the number of stops is down dramatically , @entity2 's new police commissioner , @entity102 , has largely replaced it in minority communities with " broken windows " policing			1
the broken windows theory suggests that by aggressively focusing on low - level crime and disorder you can discourage more serious crimes			1
" order maintenance , " " zero - tolerance , " and proactive policing are its hallmarks			1
@entity102 credited it with reducing crime when he was the city 's police commissioner in the early ' 90s under mayor @entity123			2
but many experts , like professor @entity125 of @entity126 , doubt the correlation			0
" crime rates dropped over the last 20 years in hundreds of cities around the world , in places that have never even heard of broken windows , " he says			1
the department justifies its continued use by saying crime and disorder would rise again if it was abandoned			0
and so its aggressive policing with a focus on high numbers of misdemeanor arrests continues in minority neighborhoods , even though violent crime is at all - time lows			1
@entity125 believes the police need to be reined in			0
@entity102 once seemed to think so as well			0
in the ' 90s when crime was falling in @entity2 , according to @entity147 of the @entity148 , @entity102 said citizens in heavily patrolled neighborhoods deserved a " peace dividend , " a break from overzealous policing			1
but many say that 's not the way it 's playing out on the streets today			2
in an interview for our documentary , @entity102 conceded that arrest and summons quotas are likely still practiced in some precincts , though he does not condone them			0
combined with broken windows - style enforcement , it is a potentially dangerous mix. that mix does n't always turn deadly , as in the case of @entity48 , but these aggressive and invasive interactions are having a generational impact and fueling events like what the nation witnessed in @entity44 and @entity50			1
and these interactions are also perpetuating distrust of police among minorities in @entity2			1
this summer , a spate of citizen - recorded videos showed @entity84 interventions and arrests going awry because citizens seemingly did n't agree with the justifications for the encounters			1
" it 's a sign of a breakdown of police legitimacy , @entity125 said , " and once we head down that road , if it 's not fixed , it 's going to produce more and bigger confrontations			2
" it 's bad for the police and bad for the city			2
any criminologist will tell you that police solve more crimes when members of the public help them catch the criminals			0
but , the more the public is alienated , the less helpful they will be			0
like @entity1 , most of the men and women we interviewed said they do n't trust the police			0
they try to steer clear of them and avoid any verbal communication			0
some community activists , like former @entity84 cop @entity212 , even counsel minorities to say nothing when approached by the police			2
@entity212 's advice , " all you have to say is ' am i under arrest ? ' and if not , ' then am i free to go ? ' " critics of reform claim that excessive police oversight and scrutiny is tantamount to being soft on crime , and as a result will make the city less safe , returning it to early ' 90s , crack - epidemic - era crime levels , and making it more hospitable to terrorists			1
but the flip side is that the relentless wholesale targeting of black men in high - crime areas is creating a far more precarious future for beat cops , criminalized minorities and the city			1
the resounding cry in communities of color is that a new approach and a new police culture are needed			0
as @entity95 's first year in office winds down , he has an opportunity to honor his pledge to renew trust			2
the federal ruling in the stop and frisk case contained a list of remedies			1
all the barriers to those remedies being enacted disappeared when the final appeal was tossed out last month			0
the recently announced policy change to stop arresting people who possess less than 25 grams of marijuana , according to some critics , may only slightly reduce the number of arrests and does not address the root problem of disparate enforcement where blacks and @entity266 make up 86 % of marijuana arrests , despite equal use across demographic lines			1
an incremental policy change does not address the ongoing complaints among minorities that they feel targeted , and that this department and ones across the country lack a racially inclusive vision for policing			1
when @entity1 showed us his video , no one outside his circle had seen it before			0
" i was planning on giving it to a reporter , " he said , " because i want people to know how we 're still scared of the @entity84 and we do n't know what to do			0
we need somebody that can help us			0
" join us on @entity292 / @entity291 .			0

beyond high - profile cases like that in @entity44 , there 's ongoing *tension* between cops , minorities
*filmmakers* say @entity2 still distrust cops even after stop and frisk lawsuit
they say *decision* to stop small - scale marijuana arrests will help but it 's not enough
" broken windows " theory of policing leads to *inequities* in enforcement , they say
