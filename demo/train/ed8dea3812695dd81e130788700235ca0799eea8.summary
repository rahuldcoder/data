-- only five months in office and president @entity2 of @entity3 secured himself a top speaking slot at the @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7			1
this feat is in itself full of symbolic significance			0
@entity2 's predecessor -- the bombastic @entity10 -- never during his 8 - years in office made it to the prestigious gathering of world political and business leaders			2
the organizers of @entity6 , a forum intended for the exchange of ideas aimed at reaching solutions to pressing global challenges , doubtless felt @entity10 's policy approach -- " a locomotive without brakes " to use one of his own favored analogies -- was unseemly for such a gathering			0
not so with @entity2 , a man elected on the promise to reach out to the world and overhaul @entity3 foreign policy			1
in @entity6 , @entity2 was handed another occasion to outline his vision and convince a still somewhat skeptical @entity34 audience			0
in contrast to his predecessor , president @entity2 's presentation in @entity6 was a down - to - earth one			1
there was no mention of @entity3 seeking to " change the global management , " another favored @entity10 mantra and a jab at the @entity45 and other @entity34 powers			0
instead , @entity2 explicitly urged @entity47 to come to terms with the @entity49 as a political reality and a regional power			0
do that , he seemed to say to the @entity45 , and we can start working together on a host of issues			0
and @entity2 had plenty to say along those lines , so much so that the poor interpreter was at times out of breath			2
he tied the issue of economic development to stability in the @entity63			0
he spoke of the numerous economic and trade opportunities that could bring @entity3 and her neighbors closer together			0
he singled out specific countries such as @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 but then did not mention @entity72 by name			0
that was a glaring omission as it is hardly a secret that @entity3 and @entity72 are engaged in proxy conflicts from @entity78 to @entity79 and from @entity80 to @entity81			1
as @entity2 himself stated repeatedly during his election campaign , @entity84 and @entity85 need to hit the refresh button or dig themselves into a deeper hole			0
the other country that @entity2 did not mention by name was @entity91 , another omission that was notable			1
of course , the question of @entity91 is never far away from @entity2 's mind			1
in fact , the @entity3 president 's aircraft had ended up awkwardly parked next to that of @entity91 prime minister @entity99 at @entity100 as the two leaders arrived			1
professor @entity102 , the founder of the @entity5 and @entity2 's host , gently nudged the @entity3 president to see if @entity84 might find it feasible to include @entity91 in this new outreach to the world but @entity2 dodged the question			1
this showed that @entity2 , for whatever idealism he might secretly hold , is not willing or able to go down a path that would require him to to shake some of the basic tenants of the @entity49 such as its non-recognition of the @entity91			1
at least not for now			0
meanwhile , one of @entity2 's key intents in @entity6 was to sell @entity3 to the world business community as an untapped market of nearly 80 million people			1
in his remarks , he mentioned that his government wants to prepare the foundations for @entity3 to become one of the top 10 economies in the world in the next 30 years			2
and in that context , his pitch to @entity34 energy firms was blatant			0
in fact , @entity2 had made sure to bring along his oil minister who has in turn promised that the notoriously sheltered @entity3 energy sector will by september launch new attractive projects in the oil and gas fields and open to international bidders			1
the skeptics will point to @entity2 's focus on trade and economic reintegration as an indication that @entity84 is only after lessening the pains of economic isolation and sanctions brought about by its nuclear program but that it has no genuine intention to transform itself politically			0
@entity2 's speech had after all no new compromises to offer , including no signs that @entity84 is prepared to change its support for the @entity150 regime in @entity151			0
such a reading of @entity2 ignores the political realities in @entity84 where his critics are waiting for him to slip			2
and as a seasoned political player in the @entity49 , @entity2 knows he has to choose his battles carefully			2
otherwise he will soon have his wings clipped by the @entity159 ayatollah @entity158 who has out of necessity approved of the idea of seeking a compromise with the @entity45 but shown no sign to date that he is ready to accept any other fundamental adjustments to the @entity49			0
this is the basic premise confronting @entity2 at home and this has to be recognized in @entity34 capitals as they prepare wish lists for @entity2			2
at the same time , a truly transforming president @entity2 should find it in himself to go back to @entity84 and repeat something that the @entity3 president said in @entity6 : that no country can live in isolation and that global inter-dependence is a fact of life			1
by insisting on such an open and frank debate at the highest levels of the @entity3 government , @entity2 can truly help bring @entity3 closer to the international mainstream and reduce the number of the skeptics in the @entity186 who believe he is a gimmick put up by the @entity3 regime and not a genuine agent for change			2
but it will invariably be a process that will include reconsideration of some the existing @entity3 policies -- including the question of relations with @entity91 and @entity72 that @entity2 dodged in @entity6 -- but are not going to go away			1

president @entity2 addressed the @entity5 on " @entity3 in the @entity5 "
@entity207 says @entity2 had plenty to say about reaching out to the world and @entity63
but it was notable that he *avoided* mentioning @entity91 or @entity72 , he says
@entity207 says @entity2 has critics at home and knows he needs to choose his battles
