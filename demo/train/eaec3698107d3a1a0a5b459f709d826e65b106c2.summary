@entity1 , @entity0 -- there was once a time when @entity0 's president @entity5 made a living steering huge oil tankers through the bustling waters of @entity1 harbor on the country 's eastern coast			1
now the ship captain - turned - statesman aims to navigate the @entity15 port towards a new age of prosperity -- as a strategic trading hub between @entity19 and @entity20			1
" until december 1989 , the @entity1 harbor was mainly used to export the goods produced by the @entity0 economy and to import raw materials , " @entity5 told @entity2			1
" ( today ) it is more of a gate , first of all for @entity0 connecting ( the country ) with the world , and in same time it is a gate for @entity29 , " he added			2
see also : the world 's most entertaining airports ensuring @entity1 and the hinterland rail , road and canal services beyond the port fulfill their true potential , however , will prove a demanding logistical challenge			2
the port currently operates at just 50 % of its 100 million ton annual handling capacity			1
much of @entity0 's creaking inland freight infrastructure is in need of modernization , having been built and designed during the country 's communist era			1
the @entity0 section of the @entity48 canal catered for 31 million tons of goods in 2012 , a steady increase on previous years but still only a third of its full capacity			1
despite these less than fully productive figures , @entity5 remains optimistic			2
he says @entity1 is the gateway at the end of a giant " blue motorway " stretching more than 1,500 miles from the @entity58 port of @entity59 via waterways in @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			0
" from a strategic point of view , it 's ( of ) extraordinary importance having such a harbor which is connected with all of @entity20 , " @entity5 said			1
" it 's the single harbor which is connected with @entity48 , with the @entity72 and with @entity59 , " he added			0
see also : where is the world 's best airport this enthusiasm for @entity0 's maritime and logistical development is shared by the country 's continental partners keen to facilitate the smooth passage of goods across @entity20 's frontiers and beyond			1
but not all are as content as @entity5 as to the progress currently being made in this endeavor			2
the @entity88 commissioner for regional development , @entity90 , recently stated that the 14 countries ( including @entity0 ) involved in strengthening trade in the @entity48 region still had to " step up a gear " after making a promising start			0
@entity5 rejects such analysis as hypercritical , believing it is not fully representative of the commitment and progress his country has made towards improving its infrastructure since joining the @entity88 in 2007			0
" i do n't know why the commissioner is so pessimistic , " he said			0
" we have already invested more than 300 million ( euros ) on the @entity48 using the @entity104 money for the period 2007 - 2013 and it will continue			0
" see also : how tiny city packs big economic punch @entity5 sees the benefits of increased trade these projects will likely bring as a key component of @entity0 's development strategy in the coming years			1
the country remains one of the poorest in the @entity88 -- only @entity115 has a lower gdp per head of population , according to @entity119			0
" it is vital not only for the @entity88 , but for @entity0 , " he said			0
" we have to develop the capacities for large vessels in @entity1 harbor ( but ) there are a lot of other things to be done			0
" ensuring the @entity48 is a solution to move goods and commodities through @entity0 to central @entity20 is " a key element for us in our development strategy , " he added .			0
