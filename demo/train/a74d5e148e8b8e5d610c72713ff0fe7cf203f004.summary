@entity0 -- president @entity2 took his case for attacking @entity4 overseas and gained some momentum in the @entity6 , but his deputies faced another line of tough questioning from lawmakers about military involvement and @entity12 cautioned about unilateral @entity14 action and sought to influence the political process in @entity0			1
here are five things we learned from wednesday 's developments on @entity4 : 1 ) ' the world set a red line ' @entity2 headed for the @entity22 summit by first stopping in @entity23 where he directed his pitch for military action against @entity4 to the world leaders he will soon meet in @entity12			1
the president challenged other nations to join him in upholding global treaties banning the use of chemical weapons , saying the red line he drew on that issue more than a year ago should be recognized globally , not just by him			1
inaction on @entity4 , he said , " becomes more dangerous not only for those people who are subjected to these horrible crimes , but to all of humanity			0
" secretary of state @entity37 said there are a number of countries that have indicated they would support some action against @entity4 if they believe the allegations are true			2
@entity6 panel backs strike plan 2 ) no escalation of conflict on tuesday , members of the @entity50 made it clear they wanted no ground forces to be part of any military action in @entity4			1
on wednesday , their @entity56 counterparts grilled @entity37 , defense secretary @entity57 and @entity59 chairman @entity58 at a hearing on the potential for any @entity14 military strike to escalate the @entity4 conflict and require additional @entity14 involvement			1
@entity37 stressed the limited nature of the proposed mission to degrade @entity68 's ability to deliver chemical agents			0
but @entity58 , on multiple occasions , had to say there were no guarantees			0
" i can never drive the risk of escalation to zero , " @entity58 said , though adding that the limited scope of the strike and the @entity14 partnerships in the region " limit that risk			0
" 3 ) momentum for military action the @entity50 gave @entity2 some momentum on proposed military action in @entity4 , but not before rewriting his plan			1
the panel voted 10 - 7 to move ahead with a punitive strike with @entity87 -- @entity37 's replacement in the @entity6 from @entity89 -- not taking a position			0
the committee set a 60 - day deadline for use of force , with an option for an additional 30 days			0
an amendment accepted by the panel from @entity99 sen. @entity98 of @entity100 and @entity102 sen. @entity101 of @entity103 added language to say the military response was intended to reverse @entity68 's battlefield momentum , a stronger objective than the one being pushed by the administration			0
the @entity56 commended senators for swift action with polls showing that a majority of @entity14 oppose a @entity14 military strike			1
@entity37 told one @entity56 lawmaker that he expects @entity2 to address the nation on military action			1
many members of @entity118 have been calling on @entity2 to make his case directly to the public			2
4 ) @entity121 weighs in , @entity12 to lobby @entity118 @entity12 president @entity121 said on wednesday in an interview that he " does n't exclude " backing a @entity124 resolution for military action , though only if there is irrefutable proof @entity4 's government is behind the latest attack			1
samples taken by @entity124 inspectors at that site were due at the world body 's laboratories this week and will be tested " strictly according to internationally recognized standards , " @entity124 @entity130 ban ki - moon said			0
@entity121 also said , in the same interview with @entity12 's state @entity139 television and the @entity141 , that it would be " absurd " for @entity68 's forces to use chemical weapons when they have the upper hand over rebel fighters			1
the @entity4 government not only has denied waging chemical weapon attacks , it has accused opposition fighters -- whom it routinely refers to as " terrorists " -- of using them			0
a new wrinkle in the lobbying equation is @entity12 , which said it sent an official request to meet with congressional leaders to discuss @entity4			2
a spokesman for @entity56 speaker @entity157 told @entity1 that he would not meet with the @entity12 delegation			2
what 's the evidence ? 5 ) the political calculation so far , the politics of seeking congressional approval have favored bipartisanship even though it 's far from certain whether @entity2 's wish for military action will be approved			1
the @entity50 plan was put together and approved across party lines , and in the @entity56 , the reception for @entity2 lieutenants at a hearing on wednesday was respectful			2
the only sharp exchange centered around last year 's @entity175 terror attack -- not @entity4			0
a @entity56 statement on the @entity6 committee action said @entity14 is stronger when " the president and @entity118 work together " and promised to " build on this bipartisan support " for limited military action			1
this follows statements on tuesday by top leaders of the @entity99 - dominated @entity56 in support of @entity2 's drive for military action			1
of the congressional leadership , senate minority leader @entity187 is alone in not supporting @entity2 's call for military strikes			0
he says he 's still undecided			0
most criticism or concern from @entity192 has so far centered around the wisdom of the mission or aspects of how it would be carried out			0
there was , however , one pointed criticism of @entity2 on wednesday by @entity201 chairman @entity200 , who said the president 's policy on @entity4 has been adrift for two years			2
though , he followed up by saying there were " no easy answers " on @entity4			0
how will @entity6 vote ? how will @entity56 vote ? @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 , and @entity209 contributed to this report .			2

@entity2 says the " red line " on @entity4 should *reflect* a global commitment to deter chemical weapons
@entity56 members grill @entity2 deputies on risk military action will escalate @entity4 conflict
@entity6 committee gives @entity2 momentum by rewriting and approving plan for military strike
@entity121 says @entity124 should decide , but @entity12 plans to lobby @entity118
