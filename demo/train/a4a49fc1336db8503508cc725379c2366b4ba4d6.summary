-- authorities in some @entity3 prisons are torturing detainees into confessions , using methods that meet the international definition of torture , according to a new @entity10 report			1
the practices documented " are among the most serious human rights violations under international law , are crimes under @entity3 law and are strictly prohibited under both @entity3 and international law , " the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) says in the report			1
" detainees described experiencing torture in the form of suspension ( being hung by the wrists from chains or other devices attached to the wall , ceiling , iron bars or other fixtures for lengthy periods ) and beatings , especially with rubber hoses , electric cables or wires or wooden sticks and most frequently on the soles of the feet			1
electric shock , twisting and wrenching of detainees ' genitals , stress positions including forced standing , removal of toenails and threatened sexual abuse were among other forms of torture that detainees reported			1
" @entity48 and hooding and denial of access to medical care in some facilities were also reported			0
@entity11 documented one death in government custody due to torture in april 2011 , the report says			1
the report contains quotes from various prisoners , not identified by name , describing their experiences in detail			0
the report comes from interviews with 379 pre-trial detainees and convicted prisoners at facilities operated by different branches of the @entity3 government between october 2010 and august 2011			1
the @entity3 government responded that the report " is to some extent not close to reality " and " not entirely in compliance with the facts			2
" " torture methods such as electric shock , threat of rape , twisting of sexual organs etc. are methods that are absolutely non-existent in the @entity84 ( @entity84 ) , " the government said			1
but the government added that the report may help draw attention to needed improvements			2
" despite their cruel and barbaric acts , " terrorists are being treated " humanely and in accordance with the law , " the @entity3 government said , in a response included in the @entity11 report			2
" beginning from their arrest and investigation to the final verdict of the court they are treated in accordance with the @entity104 and humanitarian norms			0
" @entity11 said officials with @entity3 's @entity84 " systematically tortured detainees in a number of detention facilities across @entity3			1
torture does not appear to have been practiced systematically in each @entity84 facility @entity11 observed			2
" " @entity11 's detention observation report found compelling evidence that 125 detainees ( 46 % ) of the 273 detainees interviewed who had been in @entity84 detention experienced interrogation techniques at the hands of @entity84 officials that constituted torture , " the report said			1
nearly all the detained reported that the abuse was during interrogations and aimed at obtaining a confession or information			0
" in almost every case , @entity84 officials stopped the use of torture once detainees confessed to the crime of which they were accused or provided the requested information			2
" torture was used on some children under 18 , the report said			1
@entity11 recommended that the @entity84 and the police take immediate steps to prevent torture and allow regular , unhindered access for independent monitors			2
the report also called on the government and the supreme court to take action			2
countries with troops in @entity3 should suspended transfer of detainees to facilities " where credible allegations or reports of torture and ill treatment have been made pending a full assessment , " the report said			0
@entity157 and the @entity158 ceased transfers of detainees to facilities in @entity162 and @entity163 at various times based on reports of torture and ill treatment , the report said			0
and in july of this year , the @entity166 and @entity168 's @entity167 stopped transferring detainees to authorities in certain areas based on reports of consistent torture and mistreatment , the report said			0
@entity11 took steps to ensure that the information it collected was credible , the report said			0
it " rigorously analyzed patterns of allegations in the aggregate and at specific facilities which permitted conclusions to be drawn about abusive practices ... and suggested fabricated accounts were uncommon			0
" " the nationwide pattern of allegations is inconsistent with a substantial proportion of detainees interviewed having been trained before their detention in what lies to tell about their treatment if detained			0
" in its response , the government said it " is committed to observe the whole enforced laws of the country ; international human rights treaties ; the @entity196 against torture and approved articles and put to use all its efforts towards their realizations			0
" it added , " maybe there are deficiencies with a country stricken by war and a wave of suicide attacks and other terroristic crimes , we do not claim perfection and that we are doing things 100 % in accordance with how things should be			0
some of these deficiencies , however , are due to a lack of experience within our staff and their lack of access to proving equipments and facilities and in part due to isolated incidents of individual violations			0
we are happy that this report also testifies in a part that torture did not take place in a systematic manner in all @entity84 headquarters			1
" it also noted that organizers of attacks use children in their plots , and that " most of the anti-government elements do not hold @entity237 cards which makes it challenging for @entity84 to identify underage individuals ... once it is confirmed that the arrested person is underage , @entity84 immediately transfers him / her either to the @entity242 or @entity243 to investigate the case			1

new : such practices are " absolutely non-existent " in the @entity84 , the government says
new : children under age 18 were tortured , the @entity10 report says
