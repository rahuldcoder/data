-- @entity2 's stately @entity1 hosted the kickoff of @entity5 's intimate theater tour last night , beginning a 22 - date jaunt that finds the indie - pop band collaborating with @entity9 's @entity8			1
the string octet , which is supporting the band for the entirety of the tour , is a smart addition to @entity5 's rich melodic sound , especially since they 're sampling only lightly from their most recent album , " @entity22 , " in favor of a more buffet - like approach to their indie - to - major catalog			1
leader @entity23 seems determined to showcase tunes that will push the new orchestral arrangements to the fore , instead of trotting out another new - album - plus - greatest - hits setlist			0
a lanky , moppy - haired @entity23 took the stage in silhouette after a brief overture to the " @entity37 " sleeper " @entity38 , " bathed in blue backlight and breathing softly into the mic over the song 's dreamy notes			1
he slow - burned into " @entity39 for the @entity40 , " and the rest of his band soon joined him to speed the crescendo , each member dressed in black and seeming acutely aware of their classical environs			1
it did n't take long for @entity23 and diminutive magik * magik director @entity48 to share a few smiles , but despite the warm exchange , it was clear that a lot was riding on this opening			1
the seated , sold - out crowd was dotted with more tweens and retirees than your average club show , and the band leaned more toward buttoned - down professionalism than rock & roll abandon , affecting a sort of politely feverish " @entity69 " image with their tight mannerisms and colorful stage lighting			2
the domino effect of audience members rising to see over the folks in front of them took hold during " @entity22 , " though it quickly subsided when @entity23 eased into the pensive " @entity75 in @entity76			0
" " part of the fun of doing a tour like this is we get to play some songs we have n't done in awhile , " @entity23 said before playing the tune , and it was clear what he meant as magik * @entity80 's languid arrangements enveloped " @entity76 's " downtempo beat			1
@entity23 is n't known for burying his emotions , at least in song , but it was reassuring to hear him gush over @entity5 's slowcore opening act , " @entity94 , " who delivered a typically monk - like set of calm harmony and clanging guitar			1
" words really ca n't describe the feeling that we get to share the stage with @entity94 , " @entity23 said as he launched into " @entity100 , " a crowd - pleaser			0
" they 're one of our favorite bands of all time , so this one goes out to them			0
" back up went the teenagers and the tipsy , 30 - something fan boys and girls , who were right to stay on their feet as @entity23 ended the main set a song later with the buoyant " @entity22 " closer , " @entity114 , @entity115			0
" an encore was all but ensured , but the band at least mixed it up with an acoustic version of " @entity119 , " which found drummer @entity120 smacking an upright trap set practically shoulder - to - shoulder with his mates			2
" @entity120 looks like he stole that drum kit from @entity125 , " @entity23 quipped , in one of the night 's few unscripted moments			0
an unusually vulnerable " @entity128 " highlighted the six - song appendage , contrasted by another one of the night 's few moments of abandon , a cacophonous " @entity37 " that gave the sleepy show the slap it needed to continue on for another 20 - plus dates			2
setlist : " @entity135 " " @entity136 " " @entity137 " " @entity138 " " @entity22 " " no @entity75 in @entity76 " " @entity139 " " @entity37 " " @entity140 " " @entity141 " " hindsight " " @entity143 " " @entity144 " " @entity100 " " @entity114 , @entity115 " encore : " @entity119 " " photobooth " " i was a @entity148 " " @entity128 " " @entity149 " " transatlanticism " see the full article at @entity0			0
