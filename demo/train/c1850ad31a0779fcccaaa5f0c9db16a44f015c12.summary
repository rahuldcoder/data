-- winning a gold medal is the pinnacle of any @entity5 athlete 's career , and most have to be happy for the chance to participate on sport 's biggest stage			1
for @entity11 , however , time is running out			1
the @entity12 is the top - ranked women 's squash player and a six - time world champion , but she has never competed at the @entity16			1
so , at the age of 28 , she is trying to rectify the situation before it 's too late			0
squash has never been an @entity5 sport , and it failed in its bid to be one of the 36 included at @entity23 -- and in @entity24 in four years ' time , when its application was rejected while golf and rugby succeeded			1
however , @entity28 is fronting a campaign which aims to secure squash a place in the 2020 program and thus achieve her lifelong ambition			1
" after the world championships last year i was asked how much i wanted to be part of the @entity16 , " she told @entity0			1
" i said i would trade all six of my world titles for just one olympic gold medal			1
every world title means the world to me , so that 's how important the @entity44 is in my heart			2
" but , due to the way the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) decides which sports enter the @entity16 , the dreams of an athlete in another discipline must be shattered for @entity28 's to come true			1
in order to maintain the @entity44 ' prestige , and ensure it is still feasible for one city to host all of the events , the @entity49 will only introduce a new sport if an existing one is removed from the program			2
" you have a long list of sports trying to get onto the program because it is their one way to showcase their sport to the world , " explains former @entity49 marketing director @entity59			1
" the @entity49 undertakes a very detailed technical analysis to understand the popularity of the sport , the number of players , infrastructure , tv , media and then finally takes a vote to decide which new sport is welcomed onto the program			2
" there is one man who knows more than most what it takes to convince the @entity49 of a sport 's @entity5 worth			1
@entity83 is the chairman of @entity84 , an organization which has successfully overseen campaigns to bring the @entity16 to @entity24 in 2016 , the @entity44 to @entity86 in 2018 and the @entity87 to @entity88 in 2022			1
@entity83 and his team also navigated a course which gained rugby sevens acceptance into the @entity16			2
@entity92 makes perfect sense , then , for @entity84 to spearhead squash 's @entity5 bid			1
" you have to look in considerable detail at , not just the sport itself , what it might offer to the @entity5 , what it brings to the @entity5 program , " said @entity83 , former director of communications and public affairs for @entity23 's successful bid			1
" what do you offer to the @entity5 experience ? what is it your sport will do to enhance the @entity16 , in a way which is also in line with the spirit and the values of the @entity16 ? " in a manner of speaking , squash has been sexed up in a bid to make itself more attractive to the @entity49 , making vibrant changes to the courts and apparatus			1
" the sport has worked very hard to innovate , to make it much more fan and broadcast friendly , from all - glass courts to the camera positions , to the use of a video review system and a white ball , " he said			2
" they 're now experimenting with glass floors			0
this is a sport that has moved itself considerably over the last few years			0
it has been on the basis of making itself more friendly to the spectators at the event or the viewers on television			0
" a wide variety of sports are covered within the @entity16 , from @entity145 to equestrian , catering to tastes and interests from all over the world			1
if squash is to enter the " greatest show on @entity152 , " it will have to fend off fierce competition			2
" @entity158 and baseball , which came out of the @entity160 , karate , roller sports , sports climbing , wakeboarding , wushu ( a martial art ) and the sport which comes out of the @entity16 , " replied @entity155 ceo @entity154 when asked about its rivals			1
" we 've bid twice before			0
whilst we were n't perhaps ready , we had a lot of very good advice from the @entity49 and we 've learned a lot from them			0
" this time the process is very clear			0
there is one place available due to the taking out of a sport by the @entity49 after the @entity16 in @entity176			2
" our sport is scrutinized and evaluated alongside all the other candidates			0
if we 're fortunate , we come out on top at the meeting in @entity181 in 2013			2
" squash will hope to follow in the footsteps of rugby sevens and golf , which have been added to the program for the @entity16 ' @entity188 debut in @entity24			1
" @entity190 sevens was looked at as a very professional campaign , " @entity83 said			0
" one of the keys was how a tournament over two or three days would enhance the @entity5			2
" it 's not difficult to stage , as long as you 've got stadia			0
it does n't have to be a rugby stadium , it can be played in many types of stadiums			0
it 's something which is very attractive to young people and the party atmosphere which goes with it			0
" so what would squash bring to the @entity16 which is not already on offer ? " squash is a worldwide sport , " @entity208 said			1
" we have world champions from all continents and it is played in 185 countries			0
it is a sport we feel will add something to the @entity44 , as well as being a great opportunity for our athletes			0
" there was an @entity49 official many years ago who told me , ' you 've got to wait until the train comes into the station and stops			0
when it does , you 've got to be ready			0
' we 're ready , we 're just waiting for the train now			0
" even if squash is given the green light in @entity181 next year , it may come too late for @entity28 to reap the rewards of her enthusiastic work			1
but , whatever the future has in store for her , she is determined to see squash elevated to the pantheon of @entity5 sports			1
" it 's a dream of mine to be part of the @entity16 , " she said			2
" i 'm going to do whatever it takes to get in there			0
i want to do whatever i can to get there and get squash in there as well			0
" whatever happens , i 'll keep working hard because i want to see squash in there someday			0
if it is not this time , hopefully the next time			0
