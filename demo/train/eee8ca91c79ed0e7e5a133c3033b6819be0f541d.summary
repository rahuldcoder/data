@entity0 , @entity1 -- much of @entity1 's remaining oil wealth lies thousands of meters below the surface of the @entity5			1
the question is : how to get at it			0
when state monopoly @entity9 discovered its ' @entity12 ' oil fields in the 1970s , they were found in barely 100 meters of water			1
at the time , they were the envy of the world and made @entity9 one of the biggest oil producers			1
but since 2004 , production has declined by nearly one million barrels a day as reservoirs dwindle			1
to compensate for the aging @entity12 , @entity9 must now exploit resources at depths of up to 3,000 meters -- where they estimate there may be some 29 billion barrels of oil			1
there 's a vast area of the @entity5 to explore and the size of the task is really brought into focus when you visit an exploration rig			0
after a 20 - minute helicopter flight over an endless expanse of shimmering ocean , a lone platform can just be seen on the horizon			0
@entity9 has only three exploration rigs available to explore hundreds of thousands of square kilometers and to probe the subsoil they must drill wells which take around 100 days to complete			1
progress is painfully slow compared to the @entity45			0
" the @entity45 has a contract scheme which allows private investment , which allows concessions , " says @entity46 of the @entity47 , a risk assessment organization			1
" so there is a lot of activity coming from the big oil companies			2
in @entity1 , that 's not the case so @entity9 has to do it by itself , with its own resources			1
and the resources @entity9 has are limited			2
" this is the root of the @entity1 's dilemma			2
when the government expropriated the country 's reserves in 1938 , the principle of national ownership of oil was enshrined in the constitution			2
@entity9 is forbidden from entering into production sharing agreements ( psas ) with multinational companies , which would see a @entity73 or @entity74 share the exploration risks in exchange for a stake in the oil discovered			1
private investment in the company is also prohibited , so a partial ipo -- along the lines of @entity84 's @entity83 -- is out of the question			1
@entity9 has so far invested some $ 3.8 billion in its deep water exploration , which many analysts say is not enough			1
so now there is controversial talk of constitutional amendment which would allow additional capital and expertise to be brought into @entity1 's oil industry			1
" you have the incentive of the companies can bring all their capacities that an operator - an owner - would have , " acknowledges @entity94 , the head of @entity95 and exploration at @entity9			2
" you can have access to that technical knowhow			0
" for @entity1 , @entity9 is more than just an oil company			1
it is the only supplier of subsidized gas to motorists around the country			0
and more importantly , it paid for many of the roads they drive on -- as well as schools , hospitals and much of the nation 's infrastructure			0
@entity9 's earnings account for 35 % of the federal budget			2
deep water drilling is notoriously difficult			1
at depths of 3,000 meters , temperatures are so low that oil can freeze as it leaves the subsoil and equipment must be able to withstand strong currents			0
it raises memories of the @entity128 disaster along the @entity45 @entity129 , which @entity130 says has cast a shadow			0
" it made us a lot more aware of the issues			0
we are in tough environments , no doubt			0
they have to make you think of the risks			0
you have to evaluate the worst case scenarios before going into the decision of drilling a well			0
you have to design your well perfectly			0
" this month 's deadly gas explosion at a @entity9 processing center underlines the ever - present risk of industrial accidents in the energy industry			1
so with the obvious need for more expertise and capital , what are the prospects of a landmark constitutional amendment ? @entity1 's president - elect @entity154 campaigned on a pledge to reform the energy sector and aides say he will tackle this in early 2013			1
but he faces an uphill task			0
he lacks a majority in @entity161 to drive through his own legislation and the leftist @entity164 party in @entity1 remains strongly opposed to sharing @entity1 's oil wealth			1
there is also the fact that @entity9 is no longer in critical condition			2
" things in @entity9 do n't seem to be as dire as they were 3 or 4 years ago , " says @entity46			2
" this production stability and reserve replacement and oil prices where they are - there does n't seem to be a sense of urgency in the political elites of @entity1 to tackle such a complex and controversial reform			1
" for @entity9 , the question is almost philosophical			2
" in what timeframe do you want to monetize the reserves ? many countries have taken that decision in different fashions , " @entity130 says			0
" @entity188 decided to monetize in a short time period the reserves they had			0
and they did very successfully			0
they have the petroleum fund and many advantages			0
so whatever we do in the end should reflect on the standard of living of the @entity1			2

@entity1 is looking at deep water drilling as a way of *extracting* more of its oil reserves
some estimates say there may be up to 29 million barrels available
some now want constitutional amendment allowing private investment in oil
but nationalized @entity9 is *popular* with @entity1 , providing cheap gas and money for infrastructure
