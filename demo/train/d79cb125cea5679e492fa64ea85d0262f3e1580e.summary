-- what if this was your town ? that 's the haunting question being chanted in the streets of @entity7 , @entity8			1
ever since an unarmed black teen was shot and killed by @entity7 police five days ago , what 's unfolded has been positively un-american			1
the @entity7 police chief has refused to name the officer who shot @entity16 or to reveal key details about the shooting			1
his force has responded to protesters with a surplus of militarism and a deficit of sense , skill or humanity			0
they 've run roughshod over @entity28 , freedom of assembly and the right to be young and african - american and presumed innocent			1
@entity32 : how many unarmed people have to die ? there has been a vacuum of leadership at every scale of this story			2
the mayor has seemed flat - footed			0
the governor was too long silent , then finally issued a statement , saying he would visit @entity7			1
the president has kept his distance since issuing a statement of his own			0
nowhere thus far has there been a political leader like @entity48 in @entity49 after the assassination of @entity51 , wading at once into the charged scene with physical courage and quiet moral authority -- sharing in grief , naming the tragedy , earning the trust needed to call for peace			0
fortunately -- if that 's a word that may be used in this situation -- everyday @entity61 have been filling this void			2
citizens in @entity7 and across @entity8 have protested and organized marches and vigils			1
african - americans unleashed a wave of commentary on social media , highlighting how swiftly stereotypes can indict and convict black men in the court of public opinion			0
then when journalists covering the story were manhandled by the police and locked up for reporting the story , @entity74 exploded and people across the country -- indeed , the world -- began to amplify their voices in a burgeoning , turbulent virtual square called # @entity7			1
now libertarians who have long mistrusted the heavy hand of government find themselves in common cause with social - justice progressives who can not believe that this is happening half a century after the @entity91 became law			2
what these citizens from the right , left and all points between are saying is simple : no one in the @entity61 should get away with this kind of abuse of power			2
we may disagree on taxes and health care and immigration			0
but we can agree that the most basic form of civic power -- the force necessary to protect a community -- must in a democracy be subject to the kind of accountability that is utterly missing in @entity7			1
to be sure , some perspective is important : there is still so much unknown about the killing			0
a @entity74 wave obliterates context and thrusts forward only the most sensational aspects of a story			0
and plenty of partisans on the left and right are taking @entity7 as a chance to bash the other side for its failed policies and ideologies			1
but let 's be very clear			2
what 's happening in @entity7 is not just politics			1
it 's not what historian @entity131 called a " pseudo-event			2
it 's a spark of anger and alienation that emerged first from african - americans who bear the petty humiliations and mortal dangers of second - class treatment			2
complete coverage on @entity7 shooting and protests in this age of contagion , when pent - up frustration and a desire to change social norms can cascade quickly into tea parties or @entity152 or marriage equality movements , it 's not easy to say where this spark will lead			1
and as events unfold , we would do well to ask ourselves a basic question			0
it comes from the exam that immigrants take to become citizens of the @entity61 , and it is surprising in its simple profundity : " what is the rule of law ? " alas , the killing of @entity16 is awakening many to the meaning of that question -- and to the consequences of ignorance			1
the rule of law must mean , at the barest minimum , that the government tells us which of its agents has slayed an unarmed citizen			1
it must mean administering justice in a way that is credible , transparent and responsive to the people			0
it must also mean an end to the looting in @entity7			1
but it also should have meant that we never got to a scene like @entity7			1
5 things to know about @entity16 's shooting so now it 's time for each of us not to be spectators , merely watching the flames in the streets or the pundits on the screen , but to be citizens			0
it 's time to look around our own communities and consider just how we see and treat each other			0
how over-martialized and under - professionalized our own police forces may be			0
how little empathy exists among people of different races and social classes			0
how so many of our neighbors see " the rule of law " as a cruel , cynical joke			2
and how we can change all that			0
what if this were your town ? our task now is to live like it already is .			0

@entity216 : what 's unfolded in @entity7 is un-american , a *shocking* *affront* to rule of law
he says police have run roughshod over *constitutional* rights
events have united people on left and right , while politicians have *dithered* , he says
*liu* : we should look at whether what happened in @entity7 could occur in our town
