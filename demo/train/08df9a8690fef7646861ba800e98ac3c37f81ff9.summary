-- @entity1 have followed with alarm the unfolding calamity of @entity5 children seeking refuge at our border			0
but many of us may not realize there 's a crisis - within - a - crisis : an overwhelming number of these young , unaccompanied immigrants are facing deportation hearings without access to legal help			1
the lack of legal assistance threatens not only the children themselves , but also our nation 's commitment to basic fairness			2
since october , more than 63,000 children have crossed the border into the @entity1 , most from @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			0
reports say many are fleeing violence , human trafficking and poverty , and detail harrowing tales of children terrified to return to their home countries fearing gang violence and retribution			0
while these children look for solace and safety in the @entity1 , the troubling reality is that more than 40 % of them will be processed and face deportation without legal counsel			1
it 's mind - boggling that children are coming before judges alone while the federal government is represented by trained attorneys , as the @entity53 legal director @entity52 recently pointed out			1
these children , many of whom do n't speak @entity57 , simply ca n't get a fair hearing without legal representation			1
fortunately , civil legal aid programs are working closely with private pro bono lawyers to ensure that more children will have legal representation and understand their rights			1
but more resources are needed to ensure that thousands of children do not face these complicated , high - stakes legal proceedings alone			2
but the civil legal aid community has come forward to help the unaccompanied children who lack legal counsel and adequate resources			2
in @entity73 , state supreme court chief justice @entity72 issued an urgent call for private attorneys to mobilize a civil legal aid response to the crisis , and lawyers across the state are stepping up and volunteering alongside nonprofit organizations to ensure justice for these children in state court hearings			1
in @entity85 , the @entity84 has assisted thousands of young kids by representing them during immigration proceedings , providing " know your rights " presentations , and holding screenings to identify those who may be eligible for permanent status			0
after screening more than 3,000 children from @entity5 , the center found that as many as half had viable claims for visas			0
but most children do n't understand their rights to file visa applications			0
as the @entity73 executive director of @entity84 , @entity103 , told @entity104 : " what really determines the outcome of these cases is whether these children have access to competent , affordable civil legal aid , not their actual eligibility			2
" this work is n't happening only at the @entity114 border			0
@entity53 and @entity115 in @entity116 has joined pro bono attorneys at @entity118 to file a federal lawsuit that seeks to guarantee the right to counsel for unaccompanied minors ' civil legal aid programs			1
now , as the @entity126 administration accelerates deportation hearings , many unaccompanied children may be processed and deported in a matter of monthsâ € ” giving civil legal aid groups less time to help them find counsel , understand their options , and identify grounds for asylum			1
in response to these accelerated procedures , the @entity135 in @entity136 is leading efforts to ensure that expedited proceedings do n't hamper children 's access to counsel			0
many people might think these problems are new , but civil legal aid lawyers have been helping unaccompanied minors caught up in the immigration system for a long time			1
at @entity149 , attorneys have been working with pro bono lawyers and social service agencies as the number of children facing removal proceedings on their own increases steadily over the years			0
while we await the bipartisan agreement and action we need for comprehensive immigration reform , civil legal aid lawyers and volunteers will continue to protect the fundamental due process rights of many young children			1
but without additional resources , too many children will not get the help they so desperately need			0
it 's simply not right that tens of thousands of unaccompanied children are facing deportation hearings all alone			2
in @entity5 's legal system , everyone deserves legal assistance to ensure fairness			2
our nation 's commitment , after all , is to justice for all , not just for those who can afford it .			0
