@entity0 , @entity1 -- as we stroll down a dusty back street in @entity0 , @entity1 's third - biggest city , a high gate made from sheets of rusted corrugated iron and a door that 's bolted shut confronts us			1
on the other side of this fortress - like barrier we can hear children 's voices and playful laughter			1
when we knock the voices fall silent and a young man comes to the gate			1
he asks for our names and the purpose of our visit			2
satisfied with the answer , the door is unbolted and we 're allowed inside			2
behind the high wall , four little girls -- the youngest a smiling two - year old with food on her face -- greet us in a concrete - covered courtyard			1
garbage is piled up in one corner , while a broken down motorcycle leans against a brick wall			0
while this scene may appear perfectly normal , their mother 's story is anything but			1
we 're led up stairs to a room with carpets and cushions on the floor -- this is where the family eats and sleeps			0
as the afternoon light streams through the window , @entity47 appears			1
she tries to cover her face with her long beige scarf , but her beautiful brown eyes are visible			1
so too are the jagged scars -- shocking confirmation of the horrific attack she suffered four months earlier			0
in december last year , 23 - year - old @entity47 was asleep on the floor with her daughters when her husband woke her			1
he needed money for a fix of heroin and crystal meth -- an addiction he 'd developed over the course of their marriage			1
when she was married off to him as a child bride at the age of seven , his drug of choice was hashish			1
but now this man -- 20 years her senior -- was a full - blown addict			2
monster he wanted to divorce @entity76 so he could take their daughters and marry them off for a few thousand dollars for each girl 's virginity			1
but @entity47 refused -- this protective mother adamant her children were not going to suffer the same fate as her			1
she 'd reached her limit with his destructive drug use and the monster he 'd turned into			2
but she did n't realize just how much of a monster he 'd become			0
that night he demanded money and a simple ring she was wearing -- the only jewelry she possessed			2
when @entity47 said no , he bashed in her head until part of her brain was protruding from her skull			1
he then pinned her down , got a knife and cut off her nose and upper lip			0
" my head was throbbing and he was on top of me , that 's when i saw the knife , " she recalls			2
i struggled but then blacked out			0
when i woke up , i tried to touch my nose and lips but i felt nothing			0
" @entity47 's girls were asleep except for 10 - year - old @entity110			1
i ask her what happened , but her elder sister , @entity113 , steps in and explains			0
" we were all asleep except for my sister @entity110			0
i asked her why did n't she wake me up ? she told me our father threatened her that if she screamed , he would cut her just like our mother			2
" my father then tripped over me as he was pulling my mother by the hair			0
i woke up and started screaming at him			0
then he ran away and we never saw him again			0
" mutilated and unconscious neighbors who heard the screaming alerted police who found @entity47 mutilated , unconscious and lying in a pool of her own blood			1
she was taken to hospital where doctors managed to stop the bleeding and stabilize her			0
however , she 'd been disfigured so badly in the attack that @entity1 authorities decided to fly her to @entity134 for more specialized medical care			1
that 's where surgeons used part of @entity47 's forehead to construct a new nose , while taking tissue from her thigh to rebuild her upper lip			1
" when i finally woke up and saw my face , i hated it			0
i hate it every day			0
it would be better to be injected with poison and die - that 's how i feel , " she says			1
" when my children saw me after my face changed , they did n't believe i was their mother			0
" the @entity153 in @entity1 eventually relocated @entity47 and her daughters to their current home -- an apartment they share with her mother and three brothers			1
it 's cramped and basic , and they have few belongings , but they feel safe			2
police have not caught @entity47 's husband -- she believes he 's fled into the mountains or crossed the border into @entity168			1
@entity169 , an organization that supports victimized women , is hoping to send @entity47 to the @entity171 for reconstructive surgery but are yet to find a surgeon			1
" i just want the surgery to happen soon			0
i do n't want to stay like this , " @entity47 says			1
" will i have the same face as before ? some people tell me i will have a better face			0
but it 's hard to believe that			2
" daughter 's hope @entity76 's little girls now seem oblivious to her deformities			2
they love their mother regardless of what she looks like -- though @entity110 , who witnessed the appalling attack and suffers nightmares most nights , says her mother is sad all the time			0
" we just want our mother to get well and smile again			0
if she works we can go to school and i will become a doctor			0
then i can help people like my mother			0
" according to a @entity199 report published in december last year , @entity1 authorities registered an increased number of reported acts of violence against women and girls in 2013 but prosecutions and convictions remain low			2
the report said the authorities showed a tendency towards mediation rather than applying criminal sanctions and legal protections for women , and this often fails to protect women from further violence .			0
