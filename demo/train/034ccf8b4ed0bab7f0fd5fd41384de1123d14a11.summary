about halfway up the cobblestone stairwell , the screeching starts			1
loose stones tumble from the tops of the walls far up on the hilltop			1
all around me , tree limbs shake			1
it 's just after dawn , and i 'm alone , climbing the trail to the 15th - century royal compound on the hilltop at @entity13 in southern @entity14			1
alone , except for the baboons			1
like all the stone structures here , the stairwell is open to the sky , but the incline is so steep and the curves so sharp that i ca n't see more than 10 feet in front of me			1
sure enough , around the next bend a baboon is waiting for me on one of the dozens of terraces that skirt the hillside			2
we watch each other for a few moments until i 'm certain he 's not interested in me , and then i keep walking			2
baboons freak me out , but these moments are part of what makes @entity13 such an incredible place to visit			1
baboon standoffs unlike the world 's more visited ruins -- which is basically every other ruin -- here it 's easy to lose yourself in the mystery of the place , even if that means the occasional standoff with a baboon			2
the stairwell leads to a narrow passage through a cleft in the rocky hilltop			2
stone walls that form the perimeter of the royal complex tower overhead			2
they once would 've extended even farther out over the stairs , but a terrace collapsed since the city was abandoned , bringing a wall down with it			2
it 's hard to find a vantage point to see the entire complex			2
the old city , which was the capital of a trading empire and home to 10,000 people in the 1400s , stretches over 1,800 acres			1
essentially the hilltop functioned as a palace and cathedral , the center of political and religious power			2
on the planes below , circular stone walls form a series of enclosures			2
the most iconic , aptly called the @entity77 , is the largest pre-colonial structure south of the @entity79			2
the walls rise up 36 feet and stretch 820 feet around			2
at one end , an inner wall forms a narrow passage that leads to a conical tower , the most distinctive landmark in the old city			0
i like the hill complex more			0
here the walls curve around each other and the granite boulders , which are incorporated into the design			0
different chambers are linked by a labyrinth of narrow passages that snake up and down over the giant rocks			0
at the far side is a chamber with a towering stone ledge that once held a small stone wall that acted like a balustrade			0
destructive treasure hunters like all the structures here , the stones were assembled without mortar			0
each layer was slightly recessed , creating a slope that held it all together			0
over the centuries , some walls were knocked down by treasure hunters , or just by the elements			0
the chamber below is where a famous set of carved birds were found			0
most of them are now housed in a small museum inside the park , which is worth a visit if only to see them			0
the image of a bird appears on the national flag , and is as much a symbol of @entity13 's national identity as the @entity126 is to the @entity127			1
there 's a good chance of being here alone			0
visitors might see schoolchildren passing through on their way to class , or the occasional park worker , but not many other visitors			1
tourism in @entity13 has been in a long and slow recovery			1
in the 1990s , @entity13 was for a moment the most visited country in @entity14			1
by the time the nation hit rock bottom in 2008 , hardly any foreign visitors came			1
now major attractions like @entity142 are bouncing back , but places like @entity13 have fallen far off the radar			1
the ruins are easily accessible by road , but it takes several hours from @entity148 or a full day from @entity149 , so not many people make the effort			1
but this is a place i love returning to			0
expert tours in the colonial days when @entity13 was known as @entity156 , white families used to vacation here , and remnants of those days remain			1
the national park has simple rondavel huts for hire , and there 's the dated but charming @entity163 ( @entity13 , @entity164 ; +263 39 262274 ) just outside the gates , as well as the posher safari - style lodge at the @entity167 ( no 1 shephared plot , @entity13 , @entity164 ; +1 888 790 5264 )			1
the inn 's restaurant -- where the buffet is designed like the stone walls -- serves lucky travelers fresh bream from the nearby dam			0
if not , there 's almost always a fisherman selling his catch on the roadside , which can be grilled outdoors -- or ask the restaurant to prepare it			0
on my latest trip , i went with an excursion organized by @entity183 at the @entity184 in @entity149			0
those going on their own can hire a guide on site			0
every guide i 've ever had here has been articulate and charming and well - informed , but it 's even more amazing to spend a few days exploring the ruins with people who actually wrote the book on @entity13			1
you can find their offerings at wsoa.wits.ac.za , under history of art. practical tips : @entity13 has started an online visa system ( @entity202 / ) , which is n't working at the time of this writing			1
when it does , applying online will get visitors a letter that they must present on arrival , which is when the visa is actually issued			1
those that require a visa might be better off simply getting it on arrival			0
anyone driving up from @entity216 can save themselves a lot of hassle at the border by contacting the @entity221 ahead of time			0
they can arrange to have an officer to wait at the border post and walk visitors through the immigration and customs process			1
this can save hours and endless headaches			0
and it 's a free service ( @entity233 at +263 772 409373 or lindarosentuli@gmail.com )			0
@entity234 is a writer and traveler based in @entity216			0
his latest project is a travel app for @entity239 cities for @entity240 and @entity241 .			0

@entity13 was the capital of a trading empire and home to 10,000 people in the 1400s
@entity13 is making a tourism comeback after hitting rock bottom in 2008
visitors have yet to *rediscover* @entity13 , however , leaving it almost deserted
