-- the sheriff of @entity2 , @entity3 , lashed out thursday at @entity5 officials , calling their civil lawsuit alleging civil rights violations against him and his county politically motivated			1
" they 're using me for the @entity15 vote , showing that they 're doing something , taking on the sheriff over an alleged racial profiling , " @entity10 told reporters in @entity12			1
he vowed to defend himself , not for selfish purposes , but to help the thousands of other sheriffs in the country avoid finding themselves in similar situations			0
" i 'm not going to surrender my office to the federal government , " he said			2
" i will fight this to the bitter end			0
" @entity10 rejected the @entity5 's call for monitors to oversee the workings of his department			1
" that shows you they want to take over this office , " he said			2
" under this agreement with the so - called monitor , i 'd probably have to clear every press release before i go public , especially having to do with illegal immigration , with the @entity5			2
" @entity10 's remarks came hours after the @entity5 filed the civil lawsuit			1
" at its core , this is an abuse - of - power case involving a sheriff and sheriff 's office that disregarded the @entity49 , ignored sound police practices , compromised public safety , and did not hesitate to retaliate against perceived critics , " said assistant u.s. attorney general @entity43			1
the @entity5 had delivered in december a report with findings of civil rights violations and sought to fix them through a negotiated settlement with @entity2 and its sheriff 's office			1
those talks broke down in february over @entity2 's refusal to consider any agreement that involved an independent monitor , @entity43 said			0
" attempts to forge solutions to address the serious civil rights and public safety concerns have proven elusive , " @entity43 said			0
according to the civil complaint , the sheriff 's office has displayed a pattern of discrimination against @entity71 , which includes racial profiling , unlawful detention and searches , and unlawful targeting of @entity71 during raids			1
the complaint also alleges that @entity2 detention officers discriminated against @entity15 prisoners in the jail			2
the targets were often prisoners who do n't speak @entity84 well , @entity43 said			0
the jailers would give orders only in @entity84 , and when the prisoners did n't understand , they would place an entire area of the jail on lockdown for disobedience			0
" this incites obvious and unwarranted hostility toward the inmates , potentially placing prisoners and officers alike in harm 's way , " @entity43 said			0
finally , the complaint recounts a number of cases in which @entity10 and his office allegedly retaliated against perceived enemies			2
these included judges , lawyers and community leaders who were critical , or perceived to be critical of @entity2 policies			0
" nobody is above the law , and nobody can misuse the legal process to silence those with different opinions , " @entity43 said			0
" leadership starts at the top , and all of the alleged violations outlined in the complaint are the product of a culture of disregard for basic rights within @entity123 that starts at the top and pervades the organization			0
" the december letter said detention officers in @entity10 's jail invoked slurs and profanities against @entity71 , calling them " wetbacks , " " @entity133 bitches " and " stupid @entity134			1
" @entity10 has denied any discrimination , and one of his attorneys called the @entity5 investigation a " witch hunt			1

new : " they 're using me for the @entity15 vote , " @entity10 says of the lawsuit
the sheriff 's office has not complied with the findings , @entity5 says
@entity10 's actions have *nurtured* culture of racial bias against @entity71 , @entity149 says
@entity10 denies discrimination ; sheriff 's attorney calls investigation a " witch hunt "
