@entity0 is still on the beat			0
the @entity3 spacecraft , which is designed to seek out other worlds but hit a snag when parts failed last year , found another planet thanks to some nifty repurposing by the space agency and its partners , @entity3 confirmed thursday			1
the recently found world is named @entity13 116454b and has a diameter 2.5 times the size of @entity16 's , said @entity3 in a press release			1
that would make it smaller than @entity20 , the next - largest planet in our solar system			1
@entity13 116454b orbits its star , which is in the direction of the constellation @entity28 , in nine days and is too close to support life as we know it , the agency added			0
it 's 180 light - years away			1
11 cool space missions you should know about but it adds another tidbit to our knowledge of the universe -- something scientists did n't think was possible when a part of the craft broke down last year			0
" last summer , the possibility of a scientifically productive mission for @entity0 after its reaction wheel failure in its extended mission was not part of the conversation , " said @entity43 , @entity3 's astrophysics division director , in a statement			2
@entity51 has gas , and @entity53 finds organic matter but scientists and engineers came up with a new strategy that uses pressure from sunlight to take the place of the failed reaction wheel , which helps point the spacecraft in the right direction			0
@entity0 is now free to continue its mission , called @entity65 by @entity3			2
" @entity65 is uniquely positioned to dramatically refine our understanding of these alien worlds and further define the boundary between rocky worlds like @entity16 and ice giants like @entity20 , " said @entity0 / @entity65 project scientist @entity66 in @entity3 's press release			2
