-- polio victims are not an uncommon sight in @entity3			1
the poorest of them often make a living from begging , weaving through the @entity9 capital 's traffic on homemade skateboards , seeking handouts from passing motorists			1
it 's not an easy life			1
" going amongst the cars , it 's very dangerous , " attests @entity15 , aka @entity16 , a polio survivor who moved to the city from @entity18			1
" some drivers ' brakes might fail and the car could run you down			2
" while during the week , many choose to ignore these men , and the deftness they exhibit when navigating the roads , on sundays , @entity25 turn up in the hundreds to watch them play a sport that could one day be a hit on the @entity33 circuit : skate soccer			1
" when saturday comes , i go to sleep early , because i know tomorrow morning i 'm going to play ball , " says @entity15			1
@entity15 is a member of the @entity36 , a team of about 40 polio survivors			1
as many have limited use of their legs , the men play their version of soccer on skateboards , and hit the ball with their hands			1
' bigger than me ' for @entity52 , the team 's coach and sole financier , skate soccer is more than just a game -- it 's a potential means to get these men off the streets			1
" initially , the idea was to get them to stop begging , to improve their lives			0
i was hoping to use the soccer as a way to set up business - and income - generating projects for them , " says @entity52			2
as an able - bodied man , @entity52 says that the first challenge was getting the men to trust him			0
" every time they saw me approaching , they would vanish , " he recalls			0
" people have exploited them for so long , they thought that i was going to do the same			0
" since starting the team nine years ago , @entity52 says he has nearly bankrupted himself , paying not just for equipment and transportation , but for the men 's food and medicine			1
" it got to the point that i ended up owing so many people money , some took me to the police station , " he says			0
" i took upon myself something bigger than me			0
but the game has progressed and there 's joy in the lives of these people			1
" @entity52 's ultimate dream is to purchase some land and set up a community where the men could train , farm and earn an honest living			2
" yes , it 's farfetched , " he admits			2
" but it 's a dream			2
" into the limelight lately , the sport has attracted international attention			0
last month , @entity100 released @entity101 , a short documentary about the team that makes up part of a digital and social media campaign around the @entity106 and the car company 's @entity108 sponsorship			1
@entity100 enlisted award - winning director @entity110 to create the spot			0
" ( the @entity36 ) play really hard			1
it 's not pedestrian , " says @entity110			2
" the dynamics of the game might be different , but there 's as much athleticism , grace , skill , commitment and kamikaze enthusiasm as in any able - bodied game			1
" in 2012 , the story of the @entity36 inspired a @entity124 campaign for a subsequent documentary : @entity126			1
the film 's director , @entity127 , says that his interest in the players is lost on some @entity25			1
" when i was filming , i would often get approached by the police , who would say , ' why are you interested in these guys ? they 're just thieves			0
why do you give them so much attention ? " through filming and getting to know the men , @entity127 says he has learned to appreciate just how misunderstood the men are			0
" a lot of these guys come from poor backgrounds , and either their families could n't afford to put them through school , or else they were completely neglected and forced to live on the streets			0
but they have a great sense of humor , a great sense of camaraderie and a great sense of brotherhood , " he says			0
the price of fame @entity127 , who has spent years filming the men , says that their increased notoriety has been a bit of a " double - edged sword			0
" for some of the men , he admits , the fame has gone to their heads			0
" as the team 's gotten more popular , one of the guys , @entity165 , has started to behave like @entity166			1
he 's started to really bling it up and changed his hairstyle , " says @entity127			2
their fame , however , has done little to boost their income			0
" publicity is good , but it has n't given us any reward in terms of finance , " says @entity52			0
" anyone who comes to film them gives us enough for transportation and to pay for their water , but by the time the game is over , the money is finished			2
" unfortunately , not everyone realizes that fame does n't necessarily equal cash			0
" people in traffic sometimes recognize them from tv and think they 're making money from their appearances and that they do n't deserve to be helped , " says @entity127 .			0

the @entity36 are a @entity9 team of ' *football* ' players with polio
they play a version of the game called skate soccer , because they play on skateboards
the team 's coach hopes the game will provide the players with *economic* *opportunities*
