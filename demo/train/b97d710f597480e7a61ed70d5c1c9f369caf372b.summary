-- it 's all become a blur of polls , predictions and prognostication			1
the final days of the presidential race have been a head - spinning experience , giving us a collective case of vertigo as the media deliver their own ever - changing analyses while also conveying the strategists ' spin			1
if it were up to me , i would ban all reporting of campaign officials declaring that their guy is going to win , or that their internal polls actually show them ahead in @entity22 or @entity23			1
unconstitutional , i know , but it would spare us all kinds of utterly useless information			2
we all want to know who 's going to win			0
but in a contest this tight , that 's almost impossible to forecast with any certainty			0
so journalists flock to each new tracking poll as if , at long last , the mystery will be solved and the future revealed			1
right now , the consensus has congealed around the idea that president @entity37 will win a second term			0
maybe that 's right , but keep in mind that we imbue a 2 - or 3 - point lead by @entity37 in a state such as @entity23 with almost cosmic significance , even though his advantage may fall within the margin of error			0
watch : getting @entity48 from the @entity49 remember when some conservatives were carping that the media were skewing the polls in the president 's favor ? you do n't hear much of that since @entity57 surged in the surveys			1
the notion that a wide array of media organizations were cooking the books was as ludicrous as , say , the charge that the @entity37 administration was manipulating the unemployment figures			1
there has been a manic - depressive quality to reporting on the race , as the conventional wisdom has changed shape like an overactive amoeba			1
watch : @entity72 , @entity73 a year ago , the media kept telling us that @entity37 would have an awfully difficult time winning re-election unless the economy improved			1
by the time @entity57 emerged from the @entity81 demolition derby , the betting was that he was so damaged he was unlikely to win			2
after the conventions , @entity57 was viewed as such a flop that conservative commentators started debating the reasons he would lose			0
then came @entity37 's disastrous first debate			0
@entity57 shot up in the polls , and the commentators started saying the president had blown the race			1
only in recent days , in the wake of @entity93 , has the press pack shifted yet again to the notion that @entity37 will win enough swing states to get to 270			0
that is , unless you believe @entity98 and @entity99 , both of whom have predicted a @entity57 victory on @entity103			0
watch : why @entity104 ? if @entity37 does win , the coverage of the president 's role in dealing with the hurricane -- and especially his bromance with @entity81 @entity111 gov. @entity110 -- might turn out to be a factor			2
even @entity81 are telling me that privately			0
given the magnitude of the storm , journalists had little choice but to focus on @entity37 's role as emergency coordinator , which relegated @entity57 to the sidelines after a period in which he had been gaining momentum			2
but the endless ink and airtime devoted to a @entity81 governor teaming up with a @entity128 president during a crippling disaster was a bit troubling			0
was it really so jaw - dropping that the two men might briefly put politics aside with so many lives lost and millions without power or gasoline ? the cynicism that permeated the coverage was disturbing			2
watch : enough with campaigns predicting they 'll win of course , politics reared its head when unnamed @entity57 advisers told @entity145 that @entity110 had gone too far and their man had almost picked him as a running mate before changing his mind			2
and they all spoke anonymously , a practice with which journalists have long been too complicit			0
now , mercifully , comes the actual vote			0
but if you think the media speculation game ends tuesday , guess again			1
sometime in the late afternoon , the first wave of exit polls will undoubtedly leak , either to @entity156 or some blogger , and spread like wildfire across the @entity159			1
these numbers will be about as reliable as those that convinced @entity164 's team in 2004 that he had won the presidency			2
smart consumers will ignore the hyperventilation and wait for actual votes to be tallied , old - fashioned as that might sound			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			1

@entity172 : coverage of campaign has become a blur of polls and predictions
he says in a race this close , speculating about the *outcome* is a waste of time
media should n't focus on campaign officials predicting wins , he says
@entity172 : beware of exit poll leaks on tuesday ; they *'re* not reliable
