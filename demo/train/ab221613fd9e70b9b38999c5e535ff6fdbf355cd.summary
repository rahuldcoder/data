@entity0 -- exposure to debris at @entity4 may be linked to heart problems in police officers , according to a new study announced saturday			1
the study revealed that police officers who worked at the @entity4 in the aftermath of the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks had unusually high occurrences of abnormal left and right ventricular functioning , leading doctors to consider the role @entity4 played in their diminished heart function			1
the study , which started in january 2008 and ended in june , was funded by the @entity18 of @entity19			2
the study was not intended at first to focus on the effects of @entity4 , but rather to test the strains of the job , said dr. @entity24 , the study 's lead investigator			1
many @entity4 workers have been reported to suffer from lung ailments after exposure to dust and debris at the site , but this is the first study that offers evidence that work at @entity4 may lead to cardiovascular problems , said @entity24 of the @entity36			1
once microscopic matter is inhaled , it can result in harmful scarring to the lungs and heart , said @entity24			0
@entity24 said that a healthy person 's heart muscle relaxes when it fills with blood			2
in the cases of the study participants , @entity24 said the heart remains somewhat stiff , which hinders blood flow and can lead to heart disease later in life			2
@entity24 tested about 1,200 police officers over an 18 - month period and found that 53 percent had abnormal left ventricular functioning and 59 percent had problems with their right ventricle			1
this would come as little surprise if they were in their 80s , but the mean age in the group was 49 , @entity24 said			0
" if you 're talking about 80 - year - olds with these statistics , that 's one thing , " she said			2
" but these are people in their 40s and 50s			0
" about 7 percent of 50 - year - olds have this problem , @entity24 said			0
@entity24 said some questions remain			0
law enforcement is generally a stressful occupation and police often work varying shifts and might sit in a patrol car for long periods -- all unhealthy for the heart , she said			0
the study , while revealing , needs to be further explored , she said			0
for example , testing police officers in other cities might help put the findings in context , she said .			1
