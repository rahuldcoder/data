-- the highly anticipated update to the classic 1980s series " @entity3 " is here			1
as we reported in july , " @entity7 " ( @entity8 ) takes place 10 years after high school			0
the series protagonists -- twin sisters @entity10 and @entity12 -- are 27 now and on their own , no longer safely ensconced in the split - level , @entity14 - style home of their parents			1
their perfect figures , cascading blond hair and aquamarine eyes remain			1
and in case you need any reminders that the book takes place in modern times , there are references to @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31			0
@entity10 still lives in the idyllic @entity3 and has done something unforgivable to @entity12 , who has since high - tailed it to @entity34 , utterly brokenhearted			1
she is also bent on getting revenge , not a typical @entity12 character trait			0
@entity0 spoke to @entity3 creator @entity37 about the new book and the lasting legacy of the " @entity3 " franchise , which sold more than 150 million copies worldwide and was the first young adult series to hit the @entity44 best - seller list			1
" this is the first time in history that a kids ' book has made the leap into adulthood , " the author said			2
" and it 's a very difficult thing because the people who used to read the books are people of importance , they 're grown adults , and they have a certain ownership of ' @entity3 ' because it was their adolescence			1
with the new book i hoped not to outrage them and i do n't think i have			0
but i think i have surprised them in a lot of ways and i hope i have touched them			0
" @entity63 , 73 , said the inspiration for the first " @entity3 " book was the 1980s nighttime soap " @entity67			1
" she figured that telling the story in series form would suit the soap opera format well because she would n't be tied in to providing closure -- she could feel free to leave readers hanging " with a hook ending and that would give it the feel of continuity			2
" @entity63 said she selected the high school setting because she " needed a location that was complete in itself			1
" " high school is , after all , a microcosm of the real world , " @entity63 said			1
" it 's the first time kids have some independence and have a world of their own where they 're all together and they make the rules and live their life			2
" " high school is so serious , " she continued			0
" there 's friendship , pain , joy , betrayal , all those incredible things and the very essence of idealism			2
" @entity63 hinted that is exactly why the town of @entity3 and its inhabitants are so unbelievably perfect			1
it is just that -- an idealization			0
@entity63 said she intentionally made her main characters female because it was important " to do something where the girls drove the action			1
up until then it was sort of a ' @entity115 ' kind of thing where you had to wait for the boy to kiss you before you woke up , and this story i wanted to be in the hands of girls			2
" the author said she made the girls twins because she had always been fascinated by twins and she wanted " the opportunity to do a @entity127 kind of thing where it 's really the good and the bad of one person			1
so i conceived these impossibly ( laughs ) perfect people with very distinct personalities			2
" surprisingly , @entity63 concocted the picture - perfect @entity135 town of @entity3 having never set foot in the state ! " i thought about what was the best thing about your teenage years and it seemed to me it was summer , " she said			1
" so i wanted a place where it was always summer and that 's how i came to @entity135			2
" " but i did n't actually come to @entity135 , " @entity63 said , " because at the time i had never been to @entity135			2
everything i knew about @entity135 came from @entity148 movies			0
a couple years later i went out there and it turned out it was just the way i thought it was			0
" when the first " @entity3 " book , " @entity152 , " was published in 1983 , @entity63 said she had no idea it would be so successful			1
" i remember two weeks after it came out the shock of seeing it on the @entity159 best - seller list , " said @entity63			2
this was in 1983 -- before the internet -- and i could n't understand how everyone knew about it so fast			0
and it was n't just the hundreds of thousands of readers who bought my four previous books			0
we were going into the millions			0
" @entity63 is particularly proud that " @entity3 " turned a lot of young women on to reading			1
" i used to get thousands of letters and about a quarter of them started the same way , ' i used to hate to read			0
... ' and that 's the wonderful thing about this series ; it really did bring a lot of young women into the reading world			1
" ironically , librarians initially thumbed their noses at the notion of " @entity3			2
" " at first they did n't even want to have the books in the library , " @entity63 said			1
" until they saw girls who had never even set foot in the library before ask for them and then they relented			0
" @entity63 , who divides her time between homes in @entity34 and @entity192 , said if she were starting the series today , she would n't change much , " because i do feel the more things change the more they stay the same , particularly in adolescence			1
that 's a unique time when many things are happening			0
" " these books were translated into 25 different languages , " @entity63 said			1
" which makes you think : ' what does a girl in @entity207 have in common with these blond , blue - eyed girls in @entity135 ? ' well , with the physical changes girls go through at that age comes a lot of feelings that are the same no matter where you are			2
so , the fact that there are cell phones and other technological advances now , those are all rather superficial			0
it 's not how people are communicating , it is the communication			0
" she pointed out that " @entity3 's " legacy lies in " the hundreds of thousands and perhaps even millions of girls who became readers because of ' @entity3			1
' otherwise they may have spent their lives captive of tv			0
" " @entity3 's " next incarnation will be a " @entity3 " feature film written by @entity230 - winning screenwriter @entity229			1
@entity63 said she believes @entity232 will do right by the series because , " she grew up with ' @entity3 ' and she loved it			1
" @entity63 said she thinks the movie should take place in the 1980s , " because i think all of the technological stuff is wrong for this			2
this is , well , a period piece			0
" @entity63 said she is not quite sure what her involvement in the film will be			1
" i 'd have to go back to the contract , " she said			0
" it 's something like story consultant			0
when material is adapted the original writers are not that involved			0
they do n't hate them or , like in ( @entity252 's ) ' @entity251 , ' wish them dead or kill them			0
but it 's gone from @entity34 ( laughs )			0

the " @entity3 " series is back and updated
@entity63 's books are credited with inspiring young women to read
author admits lead characters , blond twin girls , are " impossibly perfect "
up next for " @entity3 " is a feature film written by @entity229
