in a statement issued by @entity2 , @entity9 expressed his appreciation to the king for supporting @entity4			1
" any future meetings between @entity2 and @entity6 open a new page between the two sides and serve the @entity4 cause , " said @entity9 , who announced earlier this month that he would not seek another term as president of the movement 's governing body			1
the meeting comes as @entity5 is making a high - profile attempt to broker new peace talks in the decades - old @entity25 - @entity4 conflict			1
@entity2 , which the @entity26 and the @entity27 consider a terrorist organization , controls the @entity4 territory of @entity30 and refuses to recognize @entity25 's right to exist			1
@entity9 met with @entity5 and the crown prince of @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity6 's state news agency @entity35 reported			1
@entity5 reaffirmed his support for a @entity4 state based on the borders drawn before the 1967 @entity40 war , " with @entity41 as its capital , " @entity35 reported			2
@entity25 claims all of @entity41 as its own capital , and its ultimate status is one of the most contentious points in the talks			0
but @entity5 also called negotiations " the sole means to regain @entity4 rights , " a stance @entity25 and the @entity26 have supported as @entity4 leaders seek recognition of an independent @entity54 at the @entity55			1
and @entity35 said @entity9 called the meetings " a new opening " after 12 years , stating @entity2 respected " @entity6 's security , stability and interests			1
" @entity6 kicked the leadership of @entity2 out of the country in 1999 after accusing it of breaking a deal to restrict its activity to politics			2
the movement has maintained a headquarters in @entity70 's capital @entity71 since then , receiving financial and military support from the governments of @entity74 and his successor , his son @entity75			0
but @entity2 has been distancing itself from its long - time patron as @entity70 battles a 10 - month - old popular uprising against @entity74			0
@entity2 personnel and their families have left @entity70 in recent weeks , and @entity80 , the @entity2 leader in @entity30 , did not stop in @entity71 during a recent regional trip			0
@entity5 , meanwhile , told @entity0 during a recent visit to @entity83 that he was stepping up to try to restart the stalled @entity25 - @entity4 talks			1
he said his message to president @entity86 was , " it 's up to us to do the heavy lifting ... we ca n't always have to fall back on the @entity26 to do everything			0
" but @entity25 and the @entity91 , which controls the @entity92 , spent sunday blaming each other for the latest lack of progress			0
speaking at the start of his weekly @entity99 meeting , @entity25 prime minister @entity96 said the @entity4 " refused to even discuss @entity25 's security needs with us " in the most recent contacts in @entity102			1
" signs are not particularly good , " @entity96 said in comments released by his office			0
" but i hope that they will come to their senses and continue with the talks in order for us to advance to true negotiations			0
" but @entity4 have blamed @entity25 's ongoing construction of settlements in the @entity92 , on land the @entity4 consider part of their future state , for the impasse			2
senior @entity4 negotiator @entity118 told @entity0 that the @entity4 presented @entity25 , @entity6 and members of the @entity121 powers with a written document on security and border issues , " and the @entity25 side did not present anything in writing as the quartet requested			2
" " the @entity102 talks were about creating a conducive environment for any future talks , " @entity118 said			0
" but , unfortunately , @entity25 did not accept to freeze settlement construction , which we consider as destroying confidence measures and an illegal and provocative act which led to the collapse of the talks			0
" @entity118 said the @entity4 leadership " will consult with the @entity138 countries as will re-evaluate the situation with @entity5 of @entity6 , and upon all of these consultations we will reach a decision on where to go			2
