-- nearly 65 years after his demise by his own hand in a bunker beneath the streets of @entity6 , @entity1 is still managing to cause controversy			0
the latest dispute has pitched @entity10 researchers against the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) in a debate over the authenticity of fragments of skull and jawbone said to belong to the @entity18 dictator			1
the origins of the dispute date back to 2000 when @entity22 officials put the fragments on public display in @entity25			0
the skull fragment has a hole near the temple			0
proof , said officials , that @entity1 had committed suicide by putting a gun to his head			0
but earlier this year , researchers from the @entity33 released the results of a dna test on the skull which they say proves not only that it did n't belong to the @entity18 leader , but the remains were that of a female aged between 20 and 40 years old			1
the findings might have encouraged one of the wilder conspiracy theories about @entity1 to flourish , but researchers were not claiming that @entity1 was a woman			0
nor do they think that the remains are likely to be those of @entity1 's long term partner @entity49 , who , so the story goes , killed herself at the same time and place as the @entity53 in 1945			2
yet despite the new evidence , @entity22 officials remain adamant that the remains are @entity1 's and , in their defense , have released archive documents in an attempt to prove the bones are authentic			1
a report published by @entity22 's @entity62 news agency this week quotes the head of the @entity11 archives saying @entity1 's remains , except parts of his skull and jaw , were burnt in 1970 and thrown into the @entity69 in what was then @entity71			1
@entity11 archives ' chief lieutenant - general @entity72 told @entity62 that the decision to destroy @entity1 's remains and those of @entity49 and the @entity77 family was ordered by the head of @entity22 's @entity79 -- forerunner to the @entity11 -- @entity80 [ who briefly became @entity82 leader in 1982 ]			1
" @entity80 clearly listed the plan : to remove and destroy the remains of the war criminals , buried in @entity86 [ @entity71 ] on february 21 , 1946 ... " @entity72 told @entity62			0
@entity72 said @entity80 's decision to dispose of @entity1 's ashes in the river nearly 40 years ago was " motivated by the @entity79 and @entity89 leaders ' fears that the place where @entity1 was buried could become a place of attraction for supporters of his ideas			2
" interesting though they are , the @entity72 's revelations do n't shed any more light on the authenticity of the skull			0
for now , @entity10 researchers stand by their evidence saying the skull fragment is definitely from a female , while @entity22 insists that the jawbone -- which the @entity10 researchers did n't test -- is most definitely male			1
whatever the eventual outcome is , in this , the latest in a long line of investigations into the most reviled figure of the 20th century , it seems certain that experts and conspiracy theorists alike will be picking over the bones of @entity1 's life and legacy for decades to come .			2

debate over authenticity of the remains of @entity1 's skull continues
