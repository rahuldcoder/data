-- the @entity4 train that derailed sunday , killing four people and injuring dozens of others , was equipped with safety mechanisms that would have sounded a warning before slowing down the train if the engineer became unresponsive , a @entity2 spokesman said thursday			1
it 's unclear , however , if those mechanisms were activated before the crash			2
the train engineer , @entity17 , apparently " was nodding off and caught himself too late " before the accident , a union representative told @entity0			1
his lawyer said the engineer 's schedule had been switched in november from a mid-afternoon start time to a predawn start			1
at the time of the accident , the train was in " push mode , " meaning that the locomotive was in the rear of the train pushing it along the tracks , with @entity17 in a cabin at the front operating it remotely			2
his cabin was equipped with a " dead man pedal " that required constant downward pressure with the foot to keep the train moving , @entity2 spokesman @entity32 told @entity0 on thursday			2
" should you lose consciousness or die and the foot is taken off , a whistle sounds and the train begins to slow immediately to a stop , " @entity32 said			1
" it 's a pressure you have to keep -- your foot actively engaged			0
" the newer model locomotive in the rear , however , was equipped with a more sophisticated " alerter " system which sounds a tone every 25 seconds , requiring the engineer to respond with a tap within 15 seconds while the train is in steady motion , @entity32 said			1
" this train had one system in front and one in rear -- with the same goal of ensuring that engineers are alert , " said @entity32			2
but it is unclear if the " dead man pedal " mechanism was activated when @entity17 allegedly nodded off at the controls			0
" that is unknown , " @entity32 said			0
the @entity65 has not commented on those mechanisms but has said the signal and braking systems appeared to be functioning			2
two passengers on the @entity4 train , meanwhile , have filed a notice of claim against the commuter railroad , an initial step in a lawsuit seeking damages in connection with the accident			1
four people died and 67 others were injured in the crash sunday			2
@entity82 is a retired @entity83 colonel and dentist who was on her way to a convention at the time of the crash			1
she suffered spine , collarbone and rib fractures after she was pinned inside an overturned car for about an hour , according to her attorney @entity92			0
negligence accusations @entity92 said wednesday the suit on behalf of @entity82 will accuse the commuter railroad of negligence			0
he said state law requires that negligence claims be filed against the railroad , not the train engineer who allegedly nodded off as the train was speeding into a sharp curve			1
@entity2 does n't comment on pending litigation , according to spokeswoman @entity104			0
" while she was ... pinned down , there was a guy that , a chef who has cerebral palsy , he sat with her and prayed with her because they did n't know if she would live or die , and she was praying to live , " @entity92 said			0
" bottom line is the guy was going 82 mph in a 30 mph zone , " @entity92 said			0
he added that the railroad has been slow to implement what is known as positive train control technology , which combines gps , wireless radio and computers to monitor trains and stop them from colliding or derailing			1
in 2008 , @entity123 ordered rail lines to adopt the technology by december 2015			0
" we have gps on cars , they should have @entity119 on the trains , " he said			0
" they have been stonewalling			0
they have until 2015 , they have asked for extensions , they have n't started any upgrades			0
" @entity137 was among those seriously injured in sunday 's crash			0
he will ask for punitive damages in the amount of $ 10 million , according to his notice of claim , which cites " loss of earnings , " " inability to work " and " post traumatic stress " as part of the damage sustained from his injuries			2
@entity137 's attorney , @entity152 , expressed concerns about the infamous sharp curve in the tracks at @entity156			0
" it seems like there have been several incidents in the area , i believe there were four in the past year			0
there 's something that seems to be amiss ... whether they 're not doing enough to ensure safety , ( or ) not paying enough attention to it , " @entity152 said			2
@entity137 's claim accuses the @entity2 , @entity4 , the @entity168 and @entity169 of being negligent " in allowing the train to run at a place where there is a sharp curve in the terrain , ( and ) in failing to change the design of the tracks when another incident had occurred similar to the incident herein several months previously , " among other things			1
@entity2 spokesman @entity180 said the agency began work to install positive train control technology on the @entity184 and @entity4 in 2009 , budgeting nearly $ 600 million for its installation , including $ 428 million last month for a system integrator			1
the cost for full implementation is estimated at $ 900 million			0
@entity180 said implementing it by the 2015 deadline will be difficult because much of the technology is still under development , untested and unproven on commuter railroads the size of @entity4 and @entity184			1
@entity65 member @entity195 said tuesday it 's possible that positive train control could have prevented a derailment involving a high - speed train , like the one involved in the @entity4 accident			1
train union kicked out of crash investigation the @entity65 , meanwhile , has booted the rail union from its investigation into the derailment for violating confidentiality rules			1
the agency made the announcement late tuesday night , hours after a union representative told @entity0 the train engineer apparently " was nodding off and caught himself too late " before the accident			1
in its announcement , the @entity65 specifically cited those comments as the violation			0
@entity216 , the union representative , told @entity0 that @entity17 recognizes his responsibility in the incident			1
" i think most people are leaning towards human error , " @entity216 said			1
@entity17 's lawyer , @entity221 , characterized what happened as " highway hypnosis			1
" he said his client had had a full night 's sleep before the crash and had no disciplinary record			0
on wednesday , @entity221 said his client never blamed the accident on faulty brakes , disputing earlier statements attributed to @entity17			0
living through a train wreck @entity0 's @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 and @entity236 contributed to this report .			2
