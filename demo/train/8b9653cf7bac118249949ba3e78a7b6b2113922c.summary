@entity0 -- like many mothers , @entity2 breastfeeds her child			0
but she 's also found a way of making it pay			0
after noticing she produces more than she needs , @entity2 -- who lives with her five - month - old baby in @entity8 , the capital of @entity10 's northern @entity9 -- decided to sell it			2
" i do n't want to waste my milk , " she told @entity1			0
" i heard that others sell breast milk online , and i thought ' why not sell mine ? ' i created a web page and started my business			1
" a cursory search for " breast milk " on 58.com , a @entity10 online shopping platform , reveals no shortage of mothers offering to sell their breast milk			1
from @entity25 to @entity26 , nursing mothers are cashing in on this booming online trade			2
" i just need to wait for calls , " said @entity2			0
" i provide fresh and frozen breast milk			1
but you have to pick it up yourself			0

after @entity10 's tainted milk powder scandal in 2008 , many new mothers who were unable to produce enough breast milk for their infant resorted to buying formula overseas â € ” most notably in @entity42			1
however , earlier this year @entity42 introduced limits on the amount of milk powder travelers can take out of the territory , over concerns about shortages and a " black market " in formula sold at vastly inflated prices			2
the restrictions have encouraged new mothers to find other means of sourcing milk to feed their babies			2
" if i do n't have enough breast milk i would prefer to purchase human breast milk , because i do n't trust our milk powder , " explained @entity58 , a newlywed who is planning to start a family			1
this week , the mistrust of milk powder extended to the biggest single supplier of dairy products to @entity10			2
on saturday , @entity68 company @entity67 announced that a strain of bacteria that causes botulism had been found in batches of an ingredient used to make baby formula , as well as sports drinks			0
@entity10 immediately halted imports of @entity67 - produced @entity77 and @entity79 powder , and increased inspections of @entity68 dairy products			0
some mothers may be turning to others ' breast milk as an " safer " alternative but health experts say it does n't come without risks			1

it adds that , if not stored properly human milk , " like any type of any type of milk , becomes contaminated and unsafe to drink			0
" in may , @entity10 opened its first breast milk bank at the @entity101 and @entity102 and just last week another opened in @entity103 , @entity104 province			1
however , like others around the world , they impose strict controls on who is able to donate , limiting the availability of supply			0
the trend of mothers ' buying human milk online is not limited to @entity10			1
a number of sites exist online to match buyers and sellers			0
separately , an increasing number of women are turning to informal milk sharing sites that trust donors to properly store their milk and declare any lifestyle or health risks to prospective recipients			0
on those sites , the sale of breast milk is strictly prohibited			1
in @entity10 , trading human breast milk online occupies a legal gray area			1
while the @entity133 has declared that human breast milk can not be a commodity , no laws regulate or explicitly prohibit its sale			1
but while the practice may not be encountering legal obstacles , some people spoken to by @entity1 expressed discomfort with the growing popularity of the trade			0
@entity143 , a doctor from @entity0 , said he was concerned about breast milk sales , saying that poorly stored milk could make infants sick			1
" if conditions of breast milk storage are not good , then it 's more dangerous , " he said			2
" we need laws for the breast milk business			2
" but for @entity2 , the emergence of @entity10 's breast milk market is a positive development -- and not one that is solely motivated by profit			1
