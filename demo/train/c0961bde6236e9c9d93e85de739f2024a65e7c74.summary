-- @entity2 's new prime minister on friday offered the world a vision of his country as a reinvigorated @entity7 power , pledging to restore its influence in a region where it is increasingly eclipsed by @entity11			1
" @entity2 is not , and will never be , a tier - two country , " @entity12 said in a speech to members of the @entity16 foreign policy establishment , following his first meeting with president @entity18			1
" it is high time , in this age of @entity7 resurgence , for @entity2 to bear even more responsibility to promote our shared rules and values			2
" mr @entity12 's declaration that " @entity2 is back " could raise hackles in @entity11 , where a new leadership is keen to establish that country as a more dominant political force , befitting its position as @entity7 's largest economy			1
mr @entity12 , a conservative nationalist , referred to a rare increase in @entity2 's military spending and made a forceful reassertion of @entity40 's claim to the @entity41 , whose ownership has been contested by @entity44 , saying @entity2 " simply can not tolerate any challenge now , or in the future "			1
but he also tried to assure @entity16 leaders that he was working to avoid escalating a dispute which @entity49 has made clear it does not want to be drawn into , suggesting he might be open to meeting @entity11 leaders to try to ease tensions over the islands			2
" the doors are always open on my side for the @entity11 leaders , " mr @entity12 said			0
@entity11 on friday criticised mr @entity12 after the @entity55 published an interview quoting him as saying @entity44 had a " deeply ingrained " need to challenge its neighbours over territory			0
@entity2 officials said the quote was " misleading " and mr @entity12 had not said @entity11 sought conflicts with other countries			1
mr @entity12 came to @entity49 seeking to erase a perceived ambivalence about @entity2 's relations with the @entity16 that was created by the previous centre - left government , which mr @entity12 's @entity67 defeated in national elections in december			1
@entity2 has swapped prime ministers six times since mr @entity12 first held the office in a short and scandal - marred tenure from 2006 to 2007			1
one of his biggest challenges is to convince the @entity18 administration that his second stint will last long enough for him to follow through on his promises			0
mr @entity12 has made a robust start , launching an economic stimulus programme of increased government spending and looser monetary policy that has lifted the @entity2 stock market and pushed his poll ratings to around 70 per cent			0
@entity49 has been broadly supportive of the effort , even though it has led to a sharp fall in the yen that has alarmed some of @entity2 's trade partners and prompted concerns about a potential " currency war " of competitive devaluations			1
mr @entity12 pressed his government 's case that a healthier @entity2 economy would be good for the rest of the world			2
" soon , @entity2 will export more , but it will import more as well			0
the @entity16 will be the first to benefit , followed by @entity11 , @entity97 , @entity98 and so on , " he said			0
he also moved @entity2 a step closer to joining an effort to create a trans - @entity102 free - trade zone			0
in a joint statement , mr @entity12 and mr @entity18 said " all goods would be subject to negotiation " should @entity2 join the @entity16 and a group of mostly @entity7 countries in talks over the @entity109 , but that " it is not required to make a prior commitment to unilaterally eliminate all tariffs "			2
that wording appeared to be broad enough to allow mr @entity12 to claim that joining negotiations would not break an election promise to protect @entity2 farmers			0
" it is my understanding that giving up all ' sacred areas ' is not pre-condition , " he said .			0
