-- the same dementia - like disease found in the brain tissue of several @entity4 players has shown up in the brains of four @entity7 veterans exposed to improvised explosive devices and other head trauma , according to new research			1
the suggestion made by the research is that a common thread binds those exposed to traumatic brain injury , whether it occurs on the football field or in the war theater			1
" we found the same changes ( the same damage to the brain ) in veterans just as we did in athletes , " said dr. @entity17 , a study co-author and director of the @entity21 @entity20 @entity19			1
" this is interesting and intriguing			0
" two of the military cases , and a group of mice studied concurrently by researchers , suggest that a single @entity35 exposure could instigate the cluster of abnormal protein in the brain that characterizes the disease , called chronic traumatic encephalopathy			1
@entity40 derives some of its notoriety from cases like that of @entity44 , a former @entity45 who shot himself in the chest in 2011 and was found to have dense clusters of tau protein permeating his brain and spinal cord			2
@entity52 is released by neurons when the brain is rocked inside the skull and , when unleashed , tends to lodge in parts of the brain responsible for memory , judgment and mood			2
the same group of researchers at the @entity63 who examined @entity44 's brain excised thin slivers of brain tissue from four @entity7 veterans who died suddenly			1
those were compared to tissue taken from two other groups : three amateur football players and a professional wrestler with a history of concussion ; and a control group of four young people who died suddenly with no history of concussion			2
what tends to confuse these cases is the inability to isolate the effects of an ied blast			2
veterans included in the study had been exposed to ied blasts between one and six years before their deaths , but some had also sustained accident or sports - related concussions			1
questions are then raised about whether the blast itself or the history of concussion -- or both -- contributes to @entity40			2
" it 's a little like trying to figure out the plot of a film by looking at the last frame , " said dr. @entity97 , associate professor at @entity63 and @entity98 of @entity99 " you have an idea about how the ending occurred , but you do n't know the plot line that got you there			0
" that 's where the mouse study comes in			0
" what the mouse study does is ask a very specific question lingering in the field , which is , can exposure to even a single blast result in brain damage that persists and possibly progresses ? " @entity97 said			1
to answer that question , researchers exposed a group of mice to blast winds -- some up to 330 miles per hour -- that mimic what might occur in the wake of an ied blast and compared them to a group of mice the same age , living in the same conditions , that were not exposed to blasts			2
the effect of the blast is described by researchers as a " bobblehead effect , " the brain rocking back and forth inside the skull , similar to what happens during a concussion , and in some people it leads to brain damage			1
two weeks after exposure to the blast , brain tissue in mice showed evidence of tau protein			1
" we were expecting the effect after multiple exposures , " @entity97 said			0
" we were not anticipating this			0
" " they have definitively shown that blasts and shaking of the head gives you the same pathology seen in sports concussions , " said dr. @entity151 , a @entity152 commander , neurologist and director of traumatic brain injury programs for the @entity155 and @entity156 " the mouse model then gives you a potential for investigating the cause of what 's happening			1
" it 's an important first step in raising further awareness of this issue , " @entity151 added			0
some military cases were notable for overlapping of symptoms reported by football players later diagnosed with @entity40 -- including headaches , irritability , difficulty sleeping and depression -- and for a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder before death			0
the research also raises questions about a potential subgroup of veterans returning from the war with a diagnosis of traumatic brain injury			1
" it 's safe to say right now that we 're not sure what the overlaps are , " said @entity17 , a professor at @entity63 of @entity193 " most people feel there is an overlap , and some cases of @entity198 will be accounted for by @entity40 , but not all			0
" " the authors speculate that there may be a link , " @entity151 said			0
" it is very interesting to think this is going on and certainly well worth looking into , but ... there is no direct evidence yet based on what we 've seen			0
" study authors acknowledge limitations of their cases series -- published online wednesday in the journal @entity212 -- including a small study size and obvious anatomical differences between mice and humans , but they believe they have enough information based on the study to move toward developing therapies to address @entity40			0
" that is the burning question that needs to be addressed now , " @entity97 said .			0

dementia - like disease in brain tissue of @entity4 players shows up in four veterans
study suggests thread links athletes and ied *survivors* exposed to traumatic brain injury
can exposure to even one blast result in brain damage that persists and progresses ?
