-- @entity1 is the director of creative development at @entity3			1
but to millions , he 's better known as the " @entity4			0
" now , the designer of " civilization " is ready to take over a completely new world -- social gaming on the pages of @entity10			1
" civilization " is one of the most popular computer strategy games of all time , and has spawned several versions and updates over the past 20 years			1
the game allows players to build and develop their own cities , countries and civilizations across the expanse of time			1
it has sold millions of copies and drawn in fans from around the world who are involved , vocal and loyal			0
from its beginning in 1991 to its most recent edition , last year 's " @entity34 , " @entity1 said it has been a strong , connected community that has kept the game strong			1
" players have continued to respond to the game in spite of how far technology has come , in spite of how the world has changed , in spite of how the demographics of game players have changed , " @entity1 said			1
" each game starts out in a brand new world ( and is ) probably going to go off in a different direction than your last game			2
you 've never really exhausted the possibilities of the game			2
" while the game primarily has remained a pc game over the years , @entity1 took his creation to consoles in 2008 with " @entity54			1
" the game retained many of the pc version 's features , but made them available to a new set of fans -- those who enjoy console and mobile gaming			1
" we 've seen console games getting more strategic , having more depth			2
it felt like , both in terms of the technology and also where players were , that they would respond to having a strategy type game on their console			1
" fans and critics who enjoyed the fast playability and ease of control warmly received the game			2
long - time fans bemoaned the simplicity of the console version , but it won 2008 's @entity82 award from the @entity83			0
now , @entity1 is ready to take to the pages of @entity10 with an incarnation of the franchise called " @entity87			1
" developers hope to have the game up and running this summer			0
" it 's been the most dramatic stretch for the game , i 'd have to say , so far , " he said			0
" we really were n't looking to make a quote - unquote ' @entity10 game ' , " he said			0
" we were looking at what does @entity10 bring us that is unique , that we can leverage and take advantage of with ' civilization ' - style game play			2
" @entity1 said there were things that a @entity10 game can offer @entity104 players over a traditional pc game			1
connections with friends and a world with potentially hundreds of millions of players provided fuel for the development team to re-imagine the classic strategy game			1
" what was really intriguing to us was being able to emphasize cooperative game play , which was something that really had n't been a major part of ' civilization ' up to now , " he said			2
" a lot of our design in ' @entity87 ' was taking advantage and using these opportunities for players to work together -- teamwork , communication , planning			0
those are all the things that become really important to ' @entity87			0
' " @entity1 points out that a typical " civilization " multiplayer game can easily span 12 or more continuous hours , whereas a @entity10 game will take place in stops and starts over days and week			1
he said pacing and having to work with other people would be the biggest adjustments for @entity136			0
playing at different times in the day , @entity1 said , " fundamentally changes the mechanics of the game because if you are not there at the same time as other players , there needs to be ways of leaving messages , ways of communicating things have to happen at a pace where everybody can be included			1
so that fundamentally changes the pacing and the mechanisms of the game			0
" @entity1 said all the game 's traditional pieces -- science , economy , military , culture -- will be in " @entity87			1
" " you can do those things yourself but you 'll be most effective -- science , for example -- if a couple of people are researching the same technology then that technology will be discovered more quickly and you can all use it			0
" in the @entity10 game , a world will consist of 200 people , all vying for supremacy			0
the goal remains the same as previous " civilization " games -- to build an empire that will stand the test of time			1
" you have your own city to manage and you can do all kinds of stuff ( on your own ) , " @entity1 said			2
" however , the most successful players will be those that can also work together with other players			0
" unlike other @entity10 games ( oh , let 's say " @entity185 " ) , " @entity87 " will have a beginning and an end			0
players who succeed will be rewarded , and then another game can start			2
the game will also look different from its pc counterparts			0
" we 're dealing with @entity193			0
we 're dealing with browsers , dealing with kind of a whole different technology than we are with @entity197 it is not your standard pc ' @entity104 ' look by any means			0
" he said designing a @entity10 game does give them the ability to update things really quickly because players are essentially downloading the whole game every time they play			2
he said they will be taking a look at feedback and making adjustments and providing new stuff frequently			0
@entity1 says he 's excited about the prospects of social gaming , but thinks its full potential has n't yet been reached			1
" the future is really out there , but i think we are at the very beginning of exploring the possibilities of social gaming , " he said			1
" it is not like i can see the end and know where this is going			0
" he said that , ultimately , gamers will decide whether social gaming will stand the test of time alongside consoles and @entity197 " it 's just one more place to experience games , " he said			1
" games are really taking over the world			0

@entity1 designed " civilization , " one of the most popular computer strategy games ever
the game allows players to build and develop their own cities , countries and civilizations
@entity1 is ready to take on the social gaming *network*
