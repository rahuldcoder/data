@entity1 , @entity0 -- the web site of the @entity0 secretary of state was back up and running tuesday , a day after officials pulled the site partially offline when it was hacked by unknown outsiders			1
@entity0 secretary of state @entity8 says her office has received death threats			1
secretary of state @entity8 told @entity2 that " fortunately " no sensitive material was breached in the incident			1
" we found it in time that we were able to mitigate any problems , " she said			0
however , @entity8 said it was n't the first time her office , which has been embroiled in an ongoing dispute with the state @entity19 over alleged voter registration fraud , has been targeted and that death threats have been part of the package			1
" there 's been a concerted effort to barrage the office with e-mails and phone calls , " she said , " not just to our elections division but to business services division			2
my employees have been real troopers here			0
" @entity33 is alive and well in the @entity34 , and you know that , and they 're not coming just from @entity0			0
a lot of times , they 're coming from other states			0
but this is all part of the process			0
and my employees are doing a fantastic job of staying focused on what they need to do			0
" @entity8 said the @entity45 is investigating the hack , the calls and e-mails , as well as a suspicious package with a message that said " death to @entity53 supporters " and an unidentified powder			2
that package , addressed to an old office building , was delivered by her office by mail last week , she said			0
the secretary attributed the troubles to the " contentious nature " of the litigation begun by the @entity63			0
last week , the @entity34 @entity64 blocked a lower court order directing @entity8 -- a @entity66 -- to update the state 's voter registration database after information provided by some newly registered voters did not match up with @entity71 and driver registration numbers			1
the state @entity19 had asked for enforcement of a temporary restraining order , but the justices , in an unsigned order , denied that request			0
@entity8 and other elections officials had appealed an earlier ruling from the 6th @entity34 @entity82 in @entity83 siding with the state @entity19			2
the state @entity19 contends that there is widespread voter fraud in @entity0 , considered by many to be a crucial battleground state for the 2008 presidential election			1
officials also allege @entity8 " turned off " its process for verifying voter registrations while allowing @entity93 to cast ballots on the same day they registered			2
@entity96 @entity19 chairman @entity95 has accused @entity8 of concealing fraudulent voter registrations in hopes of swinging the state to sen. @entity53 , the @entity100 presidential candidate			1
voter registration fraud involves submitting registration forms for people not eligible to vote , and rarely turns into the more serious crime of voter fraud , in which people knowingly vote illegally in an attempt to defraud the election system			1
most voter registration fraud cases involve registrars , hired by non-profit organizations to register people to vote , who submit forms they filled out themselves rather than collected from actual potential voters , according to the @entity115			1
cases of actual voter fraud are themselves extremely rare , the center said			1
@entity19 officials are challenging voter registration in several swing states in this election cycle , prompting charges from some @entity100 that the @entity19 is attempting to suppress the @entity100 vote			2
similar charges were leveled in 2004 when @entity126 narrowly defeated @entity127 in @entity0 to secure a second term , but the @entity129 failed to uncover any evidence of intentional vote suppression			0
@entity2 's @entity132 contributed to this report .			0
