" i say clearly and now -- the @entity4 people should leave their beloved land of our ancestors and escape the premeditated ethnic cleansing			1
this is better than having them killed one by one , " said @entity16 , according to prepared remarks he sent to @entity0			2
speaking at a service in @entity30 , he also asked the @entity3 government , and those in other @entity34 countries , to grant asylum to @entity4 living in @entity5			1
" the @entity5 government is weak , biased , if not extremist			1
it does not protect us and the other minorities			2
it has ignored our legal rights			0
we ask the @entity3 government , the @entity43 and the @entity44 to protect us , " he said			1
" i ask the @entity3 government again to help the @entity5 @entity4 and grant them the rights of humanitarian asylum in order to preserve what is left of the victims who do not carry a weapon to fight and kill , " said @entity16			1
his call came a week after the brutal siege on a @entity9 church			1
the @entity55 , which has local ties to @entity57 , claimed responsibility for the attack , which was set off when gunman stormed the church and took worshippers hostage			2
security forces rushed inside hours later , ending the standoff			0
the radical group has said all @entity65 are " legitimate targets			0
" on sunday , evidence of the horrific clash still clung to the walls			0
blood stains , bullet holes and black residue from an explosion smeared the sides of the church			0
parishioners came to celebrate @entity77 and to place candles in the shape of a cross on the floor to honor those who died			1

" my nerves are frayed			0
i ca n't feel my body			0
i feel like my blood dried up			0
my whole body is shaking because what i am seeing is unimaginable , " said @entity88 , a congregant			0
the church , which before the attack was open for morning and evening @entity77 on sundays , will be open daily now			2
elsewhere in @entity9 , at @entity95 , about a dozen worshippers attended evening @entity77 , significantly less than a typical turnout , the parish priest said			2
father @entity97 said @entity4 in @entity5 are scared of more attacks			1

we consider what happened last sunday in the church an effect of what they are doing now , and we want all the good people to move and put an end to this situation , " he said			2
@entity113 also responded to @entity16 's call for @entity4 to quit @entity5			1
" staying or leaving -- we will leave it to the people to decide ... i can understand this bishop , this priest , i can understand him			0
