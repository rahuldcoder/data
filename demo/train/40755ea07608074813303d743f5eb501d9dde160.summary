-- on january 6 , 1367 , at the @entity2 in @entity3 , a royal baby was born			2
his father was the @entity7 , @entity8 ( known to history as the @entity8 )			2
his mother was a fabulously glamorous princess called @entity11			0
the child 's grandfather was the aging @entity14 , and although at the time of his birth little @entity16 had a brother , the elder child would die , and @entity19 would grow up to be king of @entity21 himself , crowned as @entity19 in 1377 , when he was just 10 years old			1
his reign would be more or less a disaster , but we need n't delay ourselves too much with that right now			0
@entity16 's birth was a moment of broad international interest			1
it mattered to the @entity28 , with whom the @entity21 were engaged in the @entity30			0
it mattered in what we now call @entity33 , where the @entity8 was waging a brutal military campaign			0
it mattered to the other dignitaries of @entity38			0
@entity19 's baptism was attended by three monarchs : @entity41 , king of @entity42 ; @entity19 , king of @entity44 ; and @entity45 , the deposed king of @entity47			2
in short , insofar as a medieval royal birth could be a world news event , this was			1
@entity51 : how to raise a royal baby where i stood today at @entity55 in @entity56 , @entity57 , where @entity58 , @entity59 , monday gave birth to a baby boy , there were no foreign kings and queens hanging about to take part in the pageantry			1
but the birth of the royal baby was a world news event all the same			1
there were rolling news crews from all over the world , beaming back to every inch of the globe pictures of ... well , of rolling news crews from all over the world			1
they knocked shoulders with tourists and well - wishers , who ranged from idle passersby to devoted monarchists wanting to drop off gifts for mother and baby			0
a few actual patients of the hospital leaned in doorways or rolled around in wheelchairs , looking bemused			0
it was a sweaty , heaving scrum			0
why ? how is it that when the power of the @entity21 royal family is a nano - fraction of what it once was , that the @entity98 ' celebrations and reproductions still captivate the world just as the births of @entity102 and @entity103 babies once did ? ' wicked ' author : royal baby stands for hope the news crew with which i was filming today told me that they had also interviewed a sweet couple from @entity113 , who said they thought that the @entity117 monarchy was marvelous			1
given half a chance , said these beaming visitors and arbitrary bellwethers of @entity123 sentiment , they would gladly have a king and queen of the @entity123			2
did someone say 1776 ? no ? thought not			0
i ca n't speak for the rest of the world , but in @entity117 it is fairly easy to analyze our own continuing fascination with , and popular enthusiasm for , the monarchy			2
trite as it is to say , the royal family is a living link with our national history			1
our history is built -- or taught , at any rate -- around reigns and dynasties			2
our wonky constitution has largely evolved around the monarchy , from @entity144 in 1215 to this year 's @entity145 , which provides ( now , it seems , unnecessarily ) , for a girl to inherit royal power on equal standing in precedence to a younger brother			1
opinion : why i would n't want to be royal baby culturally , monarchy has also become a form of very upmarket reality tv show : a magazine - shifter and a newspaper - seller , whose present season has some really good characters , both old and young			1
there is human sympathy for the royals as " real people " who have been through " tough times , " but there is also the sneaking voyeurism attached to a family anointed , inescapably , with mystical celebrity			0
who needs the @entity172 ? we have the @entity174 , and they 've been going for nearly a millennium			0
and then , of course , we secretly recognize that the royal family is virtually the only surviving relic of the rigid class system of the @entity117 past			1
even if ( most of us ) do n't miss it in practice , there is a shared snobbish pride among swathes of the conservative middle @entity117 in being able to present ourselves to the world as a land of ranks and titles , blue blood and high birth , a nation that still has a nonsensical strain of privilege at its heart			1
opinion : baby helps make a monarchy better the very fact that this seems to fly in the face of every liberal credo of our times -- equality , democracy , meritocracy , openness , transparency , fairness -- only makes it more delicious			0
there is something medieval at the core of modern @entity117 , and i think we rather like the fact that the whole world is still prepared to sit up and celebrate it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity220 .			2

@entity220 : royal births in past were world news events , as they were *key* to world *politics*
he asks : why , when @entity98 have so little sway now , does a birth still captivate world ?
he says brits care : royal family a link to nation 's history ; @entity123 ' interest less clear
@entity220 : monarchy like reality show ; a tie to old class system . brits jazzed that world cares
