while the @entity1 and the @entity2 cheered a deal that world powers reached with @entity5 over its nuclear ambitions , @entity0 was fierce in its criticism sunday			1
" what was concluded in @entity11 last night is not a historic agreement , it 's a historic mistake , " @entity0 prime minister @entity8 told reporters			1
" it 's not made the world a safer place			2
like the agreement with @entity19 in 2005 , this agreement has made the world a much more dangerous place			1
" " for years the international community has demanded that @entity23 cease all uranium enrichment			2
now , for the first time , the international community has formally consented that @entity23 continue its enrichment of uranium			2
" @entity29 said the changes called for in the agreement will make @entity23 less of a threat to @entity0			1
" we believe very strongly that because the @entity23 nuclear program is actually set backwards and is actually locked into place in critical places , that that is better for @entity0 than if you were just continuing to go down the road and they rush towards a nuclear weapon , " @entity2 secretary of state @entity34 told @entity36 's @entity35			1
the deal , @entity8 argued , leaves @entity23 " taking only cosmetic steps which it could reverse easily within a few weeks , and in return , sanctions that took years to put in place are going to be eased			1
" " this first step could very well be the last step , " he said			0
" without continued pressure , what incentive does the @entity23 regime have to take serious steps that actually dismantle its nuclear weapons capability ? " @entity57 , a spokesman for @entity8 , said easing pressure will remove any motivation for @entity23 's leaders to make difficult decisions			1
" it 's like having a small hole in your tire , a small hole in the sanctions regime , " he said			0
" in the end , like with your tire , you 'll get a flat			0
" @entity70 discusses deal with @entity8 @entity2 president @entity70 tried to ease the close @entity2 ally 's concerns on sunday , calling @entity8 to discuss the deal			1
@entity76 spokesman @entity75 said @entity70 focused on conveying a key point : the @entity2 remains committed to closely consulting with @entity0 throughout the negotiations with @entity23			1
the roughly 30 - minute conversation between the two leaders was a " useful discussion , " @entity75 said			0
" the president underscored that the @entity2 will remain firm in our commitment to @entity0 , which has good reason to be skeptical about @entity23 's intentions , " the @entity76 said in a statement describing the phone call			1
@entity70 also stressed that the @entity2 and @entity0 share a common goal , making sure @entity23 never obtains a nuclear weapon			1
@entity34 : ' very little relief ' for @entity23 @entity34 argued that the deal will make @entity0 safer by freezing some @entity23 nuclear development and removing its stockpile of uranium enriched to 20 % purity			1
and he said the sanctions part of the agreement is hardly a boost for @entity23			2
" there is very little relief			0
we are convinced over the next few months , we will really be able to put to the test what @entity23 's intentions are , " @entity34 told @entity36 chief political correspondent @entity101			1
the deal says that the @entity2 will provide $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion in sanction relief -- just a drop in the bucket compared to the roughly $ 100 billion in foreign exchange holdings that are inaccessible to @entity23 because of sanctions , the @entity76 says			1
@entity23 insists its nuclear program is purely for civilian purposes , with no long - term goal of developing a nuclear weapons arsenal			2
but such assurances have n't quelled sharp skepticism from @entity0			2
" if in five years , a nuclear suitcase explodes in @entity121 or @entity122 , " said @entity118 , the @entity0 minister of trade and industry , " it will be because of the agreement that was signed this morning			2
" @entity125 , @entity0 's president , sounded a different note			1
" this is an interim deal			0
the success or failure of the deal will be judged by results , not by words , " @entity125 said in a statement			0
" i would like to say to the @entity23 people : you are not our enemies , and we are not yours			1
there is a possibility to solve this issue diplomatically			0
it is in your hands			0
stop the development of long - range missiles			0
@entity0 , like others in the international community , prefers a diplomatic solution			2
" but i want to remind everyone of what president @entity70 said , and what i have personally heard from other leaders			0
the international community will not tolerate a nuclear @entity23			2
and if the diplomatic path fails , the nuclear option will be prevented by other means			0
the alternative is far worse			0
" spokesman : @entity0 reserves the right to defend itself to be sure , there is no love lost between @entity23 and @entity0			1
@entity23 , which in the past has questioned @entity0 's right to even exist , continues to push @entity0 's buttons with incendiary statements			1
@entity0 , which says it has the most to lose if @entity23 develops a nuclear bomb , has repeatedly warned the @entity171 to tread warily when dealing with @entity5			1
so finding that their greatest ally , the @entity2 , has struck an interim deal with @entity23 brought condemnation from @entity0 lawmakers			1
" @entity0 can not participate in the international celebration , which is based on @entity23 deception and the world self - delusion , " said @entity177 , minister of strategic and intelligence affairs responsible for international relations , and a member of the @entity182			1
lawmakers stopped short of saying whether @entity0 would go it alone militarily , if the need arose			0
but @entity0 officials told @entity36 's @entity189 they would not rule out a strike against @entity23 -- and @entity8 certainly did n't mince words			1
in a written statement , he said @entity0 " is not obliged to the agreement			0
" " the regime in @entity23 is dedicated to destroying @entity0 and @entity0 has the right and obligation to defend itself with its own forces against every threat , " he said			1
" i want to make clear as the prime minister of @entity0 , @entity0 will not let @entity23 develop a nuclear military capability			1
" @entity0 bombed a reactor construction site in @entity202 in 1981			0
asked by @entity36 's @entity204 about the possibility of an @entity0 airstrike on @entity23 's nuclear facilities in the next six months , @entity8 's spokesman did n't rule out that option			1
" we , of course , would like to see a diplomatic solution			0
we 'd like to see a peaceful dismantling of the @entity23 nuclear program			0
if that can be achieved , that 's obviously preferable , " @entity57 said			0
" but @entity0 always reserves the right ... to defend ourselves , by ourselves , against possible threats			0
" @entity0 leaders ' sleep with one eye open ' it 's hard for most @entity2 to understand why all @entity0 prime ministers are said to sleep with one eye open , said @entity224 of the @entity225			2
he was a @entity226 negotiator in @entity228 and @entity229 administrations			0
@entity2 , he says , has " nonpredatory neighbors to its north and south and fish to its east and west			0
" @entity0 , on the other hand , is a small jewish state surrounded by antagonistic @entity235 neighbors			0
" i do n't think @entity23 wants nuclear weapons to launch a first strike against @entity0			1
but it 's impossible to ignore , let alone trivialize , @entity0 security concerns and vulnerabilities in this regard , particularly in the face of @entity23 's rhetoric , regional ambitions and support for terrorism over the years , " he said			1
indeed , the verbal attacks have been relentless			0
even as the @entity252 met in @entity11 , @entity23 's @entity251 ayatollah @entity250 unleashed another volley last week in @entity5			1
@entity250 said @entity0 officials " can not be even called humans " and referred to @entity8 as " the rabid dog of the region			1
" when @entity23 president @entity261 described the deal on sunday , widows and children of slain @entity23 nuclear scientists stood nearby as he addressed them in his speech			2
@entity23 officials have long accused @entity0 of planting bombs under the scientists ' cars , and analysts have argued that 's a likely scenario			1
@entity0 generally refuses to comment on accusations and speculation			0
after one such attack killed an @entity23 scientist last year , @entity0 military spokesman @entity272			2
gen. @entity275 said in a @entity277 post that he did n't know who 'd targeted the scientist			0
" but i certainly did n't shed a tear , " he said			0
once a ' honeymoon ' what is often forgotten in this tense relationship is that it was n't always this way			0
after the birth of the nation of @entity0 in 1948 , it and @entity23 enjoyed a " honeymoon " that lasted until just before the 1979 @entity235 revolution , @entity285 , professor emeritus of @entity286 , told @entity36 last year			2
@entity0 's ties with @entity23 were chiefly motivated by " a single word with three letters -- @entity296 , " he said			1
but the @entity235 revolution that overthrew the @entity298 marked a turning point			0
the @entity303 , led by @entity301 clerics in the predominantly @entity301 nation , saw @entity0 as an illegitimate state with no right to exist , certainly not amid @entity235 nations			0
despite harsh rhetoric , though , then - supreme leader @entity313 " did n't want to get into a confrontation with @entity0 , " said @entity307 , a professor of @entity23 and @entity226 history at @entity309 of the @entity310			1
one reason : @entity0 and @entity23 had a common enemy in @entity202 , a country that fought an eight - year war with @entity23			1
@entity0 even supplied weapons to @entity23 to help it fight			2
in the years after the @entity319 , however , @entity0 began to regard @entity23 and its support of global terror as a chief threat			2
and it watched uneasily as @entity23 has gained influence in the @entity226 since the first @entity324 began eroding @entity202 's power			2
those concerns escalated when international inspectors found traces of highly enriched uranium at a power plant in @entity23 in 2003			0
in the escalating conflict , the @entity2 has always said , in the words of @entity70 last year , that it has " @entity0 's back			1
" " the @entity2 has no stake in concluding an agreement with @entity23 that leaves @entity0 angry , aggrieved and vulnerable			2
so , the two sides will find a way to work this through , " @entity224 said			0
" but for now , buckle your seat belts			0
we could be in for one bumpy ride			0
" how to enrich uranium into fuel			0

@entity76 : @entity0 " has good reason to be skeptical about @entity23 's intentions "
the deal makes the world " a much more dangerous place , " @entity8 says
" you are not our enemies , " @entity0 's president tells @entity23 people
last week , @entity23 's supreme leader said @entity0 officials " can not be even called humans "
