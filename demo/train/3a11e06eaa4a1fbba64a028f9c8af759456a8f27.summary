" he said it had been owned by @entity27 of @entity28 but was declared abandoned by the state in november 2008			1

" @entity49 's overflight this morning confirmed the pipeline / well - head is discharging a mist of orange and brown oil about 100 feet in air , " @entity25 said			2
" this is the same thing we viewed on our flight to the well today			0
the @entity3 does not have a specific flow rate for the well determined yet , although there have been early reports that there is natural gas and mud mixed in with oil coming from the well			1
" @entity67 councilman @entity66 said that while oil was gushing from the well in 6 feet of water , it was too dangerous to get close enough to estimate how much oil was leaking out			2
however , @entity66 said he does n't " expect it is going to be a huge problem to contain it or cap " the leak , because " it is n't uncommon			0
" " until we know the condition of it , the quickness of plugging the well is uncertain , " said capt. @entity77 , chief of incident management for the @entity3 's @entity79 in @entity0			2

" @entity49 is also beginning oil spill response actions at the site -- deploying hard and sorbent boom both north and south of the oil release , " @entity25 said			1
" @entity110 assets have also been deployed to ensure response personnel are not working in a flammable atmosphere			2
once the leak source is secured , the @entity3 will ramp up their skimming operations to collect free - floating oil			0
" we know this well is close to important marshes in the @entity120 , so it is important that this well is cut off quickly and the oil is contained and removed , " he said			0
a safety zone has been established 2 miles around the site to protect vessels and mariners from the hazards associated with the release , the @entity3 said			0
