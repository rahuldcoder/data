-- when @entity4 and @entity5 take to the field at @entity8 's @entity7 on friday , memories of a bloody , war - torn history between the neighboring countries will be brought sharply into focus			1
the 2014 world cup qualifying tie will be the first time the two teams have played each other since the break up of the former @entity15 and then the @entity16 , which raged between 1991 and 1995			1
the break up of @entity15 in the early 1990s caused the bloodiest conflict on the @entity20 continent since @entity21 , with an estimated 140,000 people killed			0
as the wounds of war continue to heal , @entity5 coach @entity23 has urged fans not to use the game as an attempt to settle old scores			1
" i implore the @entity34 fans to back us with their love for the national team and not hatred for our opponents , " @entity23 , who picked up 53 caps for @entity5 between 1990 and 2002 , told reporters ahead of the match			1
" all those who turn up should support us in the most dignified manner and if they do , they will put the much - needed wind in our sails to get the result we want in this historic match			1
" this is a great chance to show everyone , including @entity47 and @entity48 , what we are really like			0
both teams have the capacity to keep this event a football match and show the world that they are great football nations			1
" cursed war a @entity5 victory on friday would effectively end @entity4 's @entity59 qualification hopes			1
@entity5 currently sit second in the group , level on 10 points with leaders @entity64 , while @entity4 are on four points and would be nine points behind @entity23 's side should they lose the much - anticipated game			1
like @entity23 , @entity4 coach @entity69 wants his players to inspire passionate support from their fans			1
and like @entity73 , @entity69 is keen to move away from the past			0
" this game is n't a continuation of the war , " the former @entity15 player told @entity77 's @entity76 earlier this week			1
" we 've already witnessed the real , cursed and horrid war and we 're still carrying the wounds and the scars			1
" this is just a passionate , important football match that stirs up a lot of emotion in people : an important game for our position in the group table and for the continued development of my players			2
" if we win , we 'll cut the gap to three points and we 're still in the running for qualification			2
" both @entity69 and @entity73 played when @entity5 and @entity15 were drawn together in the qualifying tournament for @entity101			1
the first match in @entity103 in august 1999 was drawn 0 - 0 , while the return fixture in @entity8 later the same year was crucial to both their hopes of reaching the championships in @entity108 and @entity64			2
" the stadium in @entity8 was like a volcano , " recalls @entity69 , who played in the match , while @entity23 missed out			2
" there were police everywhere			0
" there were lots of former teammates who had played alongside each other for @entity15 now facing each other			0
now no longer on the same side			0
" there was a banner there ' @entity124 ' , the city that was so symbolic of the war , " added @entity69 , referring to the @entity34 city that was heavily damaged during a siege in the conflict			2
@entity130 was the birthplace of @entity69 , who was the son of a @entity34 mother and @entity4 father			1
these days about one third of @entity130 's population is made up of @entity4 , though the two ethnic groups remain segregated			1
" all the @entity4 will be watching at home ; we 've had bad experiences in the past when we 've tried to watch @entity4 games and @entity34 have come and thrown stones at the cafes we 're in , " @entity137 , president of the town 's @entity138 , told the independent newspaper			1
" every time i went up to take a free - kick or a corner , tension was high , " continued @entity69 , as he recalled more memories from that @entity8 game in 1990			0
" i hit the woodwork twice , once the post , another time the crossbar			0
" and i also played a part in the goals from ( @entity160 ) @entity159 and ( @entity162 ) @entity161 : 2 - 2 , we qualified , @entity5 were knocked out			1
" bloody history @entity69 and his team is likely to encounter a similarly vociferous atmosphere at the @entity7 on friday			2
no away supporters will attend either of the @entity59 qualifying matches between the two teams			1
the @entity7 has its own bloody history			0
it was the scene of an infamous encounter between @entity34 club @entity173 and @entity4 team @entity174 in 1990 which saw a riot break out and a number people stabbed and wounded			1
friday 's game will serve as a barometer for the mood of fans , with those who remember the conflict and those too young to have witnessed the fighting being brought together			2
" i 've been to @entity8 and @entity103 and both cities , both countries , view this as something much bigger than football , " @entity185 , author of when friday comes : @entity192 in the @entity193 , told @entity0			2
" in the past the game has really been the canary in the mine in terms of the political dynamics on the ground			0
" it is a little different now			0
the older generations , of course , remember the horrors and this is an extension of that in some respects			0
" but younger people are different			0
few of the players , especially in @entity4 , have much experience of life before 1990			1
for them this is a game			0
" it is the people around it that have long memories and remember what was a particularly vicious civil war			2
every year the hatred gets a little less			0
" both @entity23 and @entity69 called for calm ahead of the contest and will be expected to set a dignified tone on friday , but the two coaches did not always see eye - to - eye during their playing careers			1
" @entity73 and @entity69 have a long dislike of each other , stemming from the 1991 yugoslav cup final between @entity229 and @entity174 , " explained @entity185			0
" it took place just as war was breaking out			2
they both got sent off bad mouthing each other			0
they have both said ridiculously nationalistic things in the past			0
" but the two have buried a 20 - year feud by meeting and agreeing to lead by a positive example			0
it 's up to everyone there on friday night to follow suit			0
