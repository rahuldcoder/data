-- tv sets , computers and smartphones are hard to find in @entity4 , @entity5 , but farmers here are using an age - old mass communication tool to learn the tricks of their trade : radio			1
in a country where the vast majority of the population lives off the land , scores of smallholders in rural communities tune in to @entity5 to get valuable information and share ideas on how to improve their yields -- from fertilizing techniques and cultivation tips to harvesting practices and weather forecasts			1
" most of our farmers ... are illiterate , " says @entity27 , executive director at @entity5			1
" they 're not able to read newspapers or pamphlets or booklets , and even televisions are not out there in the community			0
so radio is actually the only source of critical information to our farmers , and statistics are showing right now that over 60 % of the rural populace at least own a radio			2
" @entity5 is one of the partner stations of @entity46 , a non-profit organization that 's been teaming up with @entity48 radio broadcasters since the late 1970s			1
the @entity50 - based group offers its hundreds of partners in @entity52 a wide array of resources , including a weekly electronic news service and an online community that connects broadcasters across the continent			0
it also researches and writes radio scripts covering issues such as crop production , farm management and community health			0
the scripts , which are offered for free , are translated in local languages and read in 38 countries , according to the group			0
in rural parts of @entity5 , farmers often gather at radio listening clubs to tune in and discuss what they 've heard			1
" the issue of radio listeners ' clubs is very critical to our model , " says @entity27			0
" we do understand that when farmers come together in a group to listen together to a radio program , thereafter they are able to discuss and dialogue on what they 've listened to and then they 're able to use that in their various fields , " he adds			1
@entity5 , a landlocked country in southeastern @entity52 , has one of the largest rural populations in the continent			2
agriculture accounts for about 80 % of the country 's labor force , which is why local farm programming can make a big difference in people 's lives			2
" right now we are promoting groundnut growing , not only for food , but for income , " says @entity27			0
" so we say that if our farmers are able to produce good groundnuts , which can fetch good prices at the market , then that is very beneficial to their income security			0
" one of the groundnut farmers who benefited from receiving the station 's audible agriculture advice is @entity107 , who relies on his agriculture income to pay for his children 's school fees and clothing			2
he says he expects his harvest to increase this year after following the radio station 's advice , which enabled him to plant two groundnut rows on a ridge instead of one			2
@entity5 's head of state : ' why i 'm selling presidential jet ' @entity121 , a government agriculture advisor in @entity5 , says the radio programs have been very successful in helping farmers improve their skills and harvest their produce at the best time			1
" most often they used to harvest in june , but after listening on the radio they ... harvest their crops in may , which was very important because whenever there 's a late time of harvesting , there 's a loss of products , " says @entity121			0
from preventing the loss of produce to increasing harvests , the broadcasters believe that the lessons learned over the radio airwaves can help fight food insecurity and improve lives in @entity5 's rural communities			1
" we know that if they improve their famine situation , then their income improves , but also the nutrition improves , and their whole livelihood changes for the better , " says @entity27 .			0
