-- vacationers at @entity4 and @entity5 national parks this summer should make extra efforts to wash their hands , the @entity1 urged wednesday , after noting a spike in sicknesses among visitors so far			1
in a news release , the park service noted " greater than normal reports of gastrointestinal illness " among those visiting the park in northwestern @entity17 as well as areas in @entity19 outside the two parks			1
that includes an incident june 7 , when members of a tour group visiting @entity25 -- a part of @entity4 that 's located on the @entity19 / @entity17 border -- began complaining of stomach and other issues			1
park employees who had been in contact with this group reported similar symptoms within 48 hours			2
subsequent tests indicated that they were suffering from norovirus , which the @entity37 notes is " a very contagious virus that ( can be contracted ) from an infected person , contaminated food or water or by touching contaminated surfaces			0
" in addition to visitors , there have been more than 100 suspected cases of norovirus among @entity4 employees and another 50 suspected cases among @entity5 workers , the @entity1 said in a press release			1
the park service and businesses servicing visitors are taking special steps given the surge in illness , including more frequent cleaning and disinfection of public areas			2
as part of these measures , park employees showing signs of infection must be symptom - free for 72 hours before returning to work			0
news of the spate of norovirus cases spurred a wide range of comments on @entity4 's @entity73 page , including some offering appreciation for the update and others expressing concern to hear of the illness before their planned trip to the park			1
one woman said she was among the visitors who got sick around june 7 , calling it " the worst pain i have ever had			0
" " i 'm going this weekend and will be washing my hands like crazy , not to mention using disinfecting wipes after leaving public areas , " another woman wrote			0
" this sounds like a quick way to ruin a trip hope everyone is ok ! " this is n't the first time that illnesses have plagued national parks out west			1
last summer , at least eight visitors to @entity99 contracted hantavirus pulmonary syndrome			0
another @entity99 camper dies in hantavirus outbreak officials at that park , which receives about 4 million visitors a year , reached out to all people who stayed between mid-june and the end of august at the " signature tent cabins " that quickly became the epicenter of the investigation			0
rare but serious , hantavirus pulmonary syndrome has symptoms that mimic a cold or the flu and can be spread through contact with the urine , droppings or saliva of infected rodents , primarily deer mice			0
this year , national parks are saddled with another problem : $ 113 million in budget cuts tied to the federal government " sequester			2
" but there 's been no indication lower funding will have any impact on how officials from @entity99 and @entity5 parks tackle the rise in norovirus cases .			2

the @entity1 notes " greater than normal reports of gastrointestinal illness "
they have *occurred* in @entity4 and @entity5 national parks and other areas
