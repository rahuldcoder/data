when @entity1 charged onto the stage , palms clasped high and a broad grin greeting his supporters , he could have been mistaken for the election winner			0
in fact @entity1 , leader of the @entity7 party , had conceded defeat to @entity10 just half an hour earlier			1
his radical left party will not support the center - right election winner , but remain in opposition			1
the outcome sent a shudder of relief through the markets and @entity18 , whose leaders applauded @entity10 's win as a showing of courage and resilience from the @entity26 people			1
but sunday 's result -- delivering nearly 27 % support for @entity7 -- has upended the @entity26 political landscape , splintering the duopoly which has controlled the country for almost four decades			1
as negotiations over a new government continue , questions are being raised around which party -- or parties -- will emerge as the country 's dominant center - left force			1
@entity41 , under the @entity40 dynasty , has long staked that claim			1
but now , with its vote collapsed to just over 12 % from almost 44 % in 2009 , it faces a fight for survival			0
for many @entity7 supporters , sunday 's results were a triumph			1
beyond its six-fold increase in support in three years , the party is now set up to be an active agitator on the opposition benches			1
read about the human cost of @entity26 's recession and @entity7 does not have to run a country in deep recession , with unemployment over 20 % and that faces a real risk of toppling out of the euro -- a challenge for the most experienced political hands			1
sunday 's results were an " enormous success , " said @entity66 , a 36 - year old architect and @entity7 supporter			1
" i think @entity1 will become prime minister in the next couple of years			0
" @entity1 is 37 , born the year @entity26 's military dictatorship fell , and as such represents a political future unfettered by history , according to @entity66			2
" he has n't been brought up in this corrupt political system , " she said			0
" this is what we hope for			0
" as for @entity10 and @entity41 : " no one wants them			1
" instead @entity1 , who had sworn to tear up the austerity plans because he believed it was sending the country to " hell , " will likely be a strident voice against the country 's leaders			0
he has said the party , from its position as opposition , will continue to demand the bailouts be scrapped and believes it will be " vindicated " for that position			0
" even if it did n't manage to take the first place , @entity7 is now the most basic body representing the average individual , the progressive and the anti-memorandum [ anti-bailout ] portion of our population , " @entity1 said			2
@entity26 's economic orphans according to @entity103 , a @entity26 journalist and political commentator , @entity7 has corralled not only those angry at austerity , but the youth who may be voting for the first time			1
that age group remembers @entity7 's backing of their protests during the riots of 2008 , which followed the fatal shooting of a teenage boy by police , @entity103 said			2
but much of the party 's recent success is down to @entity1 , who @entity103 describes as " very bright , and very ambitious , and a little bit ruthless too			0
" a trained civil engineer , who joined the @entity121 as a high school student , @entity1 shot to prominence in 2006			0
after being put forward as a candidate for the mayor of @entity126 , he swept 10 % of the vote to come third -- far more than previous left - wing candidates had managed			2
at that point , he became a " media darling , " @entity103 said			0
he has since built a young guard around him , who are of " another generation ... new , fresh and different , " @entity103 added			0
@entity7 can now try to establish themselves as a " true , center - left " party which is " young , radical and clean ... with no skeletons , " @entity103 said			1
but it could face competition from a @entity41 and @entity138 coalition , should they choose to work together			2
@entity1 faces an entrenched political system and a @entity18 desperate to dampen instability as it continues with its austerity plan -- even one which may be diluted			0
former prime minister @entity40 , who negotiated the country 's first bailout after revealing the country 's 2009 budget deficit would be most than four times higher than the @entity149 limit , told @entity150 monday he believed @entity41 's moves to cut the deficit had enjoyed wide support			1
" i do n't consider mr. @entity1 a progressive , " the former @entity41 leader said			2
" i think our agenda was actually a progressive agenda , in reforming the country and changing the country and making the necessary changes in order to be a viable economy and a very transparent and just state , " he said			0
@entity40 said lessons could be learnt , such as pushing stimulus packages alongside austerity			0
but a key destabilizing factor , he said , is " the deep sense of uncertainty			0
for the last two ... two and a half years , what [ has been ] most corrosive in the @entity26 society but also in the @entity26 economy is the sense of this lack of certainty ... that we may be in , or out of the euro			2

@entity7 increases its support six-fold in @entity26 elections
it has said it will not support @entity10 in government
its *dramatic* rise in support comes at the cost of @entity41
the shift could signal a battle for the center left
