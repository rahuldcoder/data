-- a @entity2 - appointed commission in @entity3 could turn the 2012 @entity2 presidential nominating calendar topsy - turvy friday if it goes ahead with plans to shift the state 's primary to january 31			1
the move would flout @entity10 rules that forbid any state -- other than the first four early voting states -- from holding a contest before march 6 , likely sparking a chain reaction as those states move their contests into january to protect their roles in the process			1
@entity3 's representatives on the @entity10 approved the current calendar rules at a meeting last year			2
but top @entity3 @entity2 have since demanded that their state go fifth in the 2012 process , after the first four " carve out " states of @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			1
@entity10 officials had been hoping to allow the @entity3 to move its contest to feb. 21 , which would still violate party rules but satisfy @entity3 's desire to go fifth			1
@entity3 @entity2 told @entity0 this week , however , that the prospect of states like @entity35 and @entity36 also holding caucus or primary contests in february forced their hand			1
what do you think of the candidates ? a spokeswoman for the @entity10 said they were still working to keep the calendar intact			0
" we 're going to continue working with @entity3 and other states until the deadline on october 1st to ensure they remain within the party rules , " said spokeswoman @entity46			0
" any state that violates the rules will lose 50 % of its delegates			0
" @entity3 @entity2 , who want a primary date all to themselves , are not budging , even in the face of penalties from the @entity10			1
" nothing has changed , " said @entity3 house speaker @entity58			0
" i believe jan. 31st is the right day for @entity3 and anticipate the committee making that date official			0
" under committee rules , states in violation of the calendar can be stripped of half their delegates to next august 's @entity67 in @entity68			0
@entity10 members are also mulling stiffer penalties for rule - breaking states , like banishing those delegations to far away hotels in the @entity68 area and giving their delegations the worst seats inside the convention hall			2
a spokesman for the @entity2 of @entity3 brushed off the threats			2
" if there is some process in 24 hours time that ensures @entity3 as fifth , then i think the commission could be swayed , " said @entity81 spokesman @entity80			0
" but short of that , the speaker 's prediction seems accurate			0
" @entity91 chairman @entity90 issued a joint statement thursday with his counterparts from @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 , promising to leap ahead of @entity3 and into january if the @entity3 commission moves ahead with its plan			0
" the four sanctioned , early states have been very clear that we will move together , if necessary , to ensure order as outlined in @entity10 rules , " @entity90 said			1
" if we are forced to change our dates together , we will			0
" the first four states would also face penalties if they move from february into january , but @entity28 @entity2 chairman @entity103 dared the @entity10 to punish his state if @entity3 triggers the chaos			1
@entity103 said he would wait until after @entity3 finalizes its primary date before naming @entity28 's date			1
@entity108 , which had flirted with moving up its primary date , decided to hold its primary on march 6 , in compliance with committee calendar rules .			2
