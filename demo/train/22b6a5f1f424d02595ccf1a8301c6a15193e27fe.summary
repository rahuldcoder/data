@entity0 , @entity1 -- we 're at the peak of @entity5 in the middle of southern @entity1			1
it 's about 85 degrees , the coolest it has been all week , and there 's a slight breeze that carries voices before we can see the singers			1
" this land is your land			2
this land is my land			2
" more than 600 dusty , sweaty people are singing as they hike through the hardwoods up the mountain			1
their protest signs -- " @entity21 " and " @entity22 " -- poke through the leaves			2
the song is a @entity26 tune , the one that became a folk anthem of sorts in the 1960s , and it seems very appropriate for this moment			0
" as i went walking that ribbon of highway , i saw above me that endless skyway , " the marchers continue			0
see a preview of " @entity38 : working in @entity39 " about 150 people in this group have been walking the twisting mountain highways through @entity1 's coal fields for six days			1
the 50 - mile march is re-creating the 1921 march on @entity0 that led to a bloody battle between thousands of coal miners and coal company supporters			1
the fight eventually brought unions , along with respectable wages , to the coal mines of @entity1			1
but this time , the march is n't about unions			0
it 's about saving a mountain			1
it has been organized to oppose " @entity62 , " or mountaintop removal , a highly effective type of mining that involves blasting away slopes to get at the profitable coal seams underneath			1
coal companies own most of the land rights on @entity5 now , and they have fought national historic landmark status for the site , which would protect it from being destroyed			1
" if you stand for preserving our cultural heritage instead of destroying it , you stand for @entity5 , " @entity68 said to his followers before he led marchers out of @entity71 , @entity1 , last week			1
@entity75 is a history professor at the local community college , and the great grandson of @entity78 , one of the organizers of the original march on @entity0			0
@entity68 believes in replacing mountaintop removal with more traditional underground mining , which he says will employ more people			1
" if you stand for more jobs instead of fewer jobs , you stand for @entity5 , " he says			1
but this is coal country , where families and fortunes depend on coal jobs , and most people who live here believe the opposite of what @entity75 says			1
" why do n't they get a job , instead of taking ours , " one young coal miner watching from his porch asks			0
ten miles from their destination , group organizers , and even miners opposed to the march , tell us that the protesters have now entered " the belly of the beast			1
" " @entity107 ? ... sit in the @entity112 ! ! " reads one of many homemade signs hung on fences and porches along the route			0
coal is used to generate about half of the electricity consumed in the @entity39 , and @entity1 is the second largest producer of that coal			1
" i do n't want to ruin the entire @entity1 economy , which is based on the coal industry			1
that is not my goal , " a young activist said during the march			0
" i just do n't want to see coal mining that destroys rivers , drives away the biodiversity of such a beautiful place and also drives away other jobs that could be in place of coal mining			1
" she is surprised when told that her environmental stance against coal is interpreted by local miners as attempt to take away their jobs			1
@entity139 is a union miner watching the march from his front porch			0
he lost his job when the coal company near his home was denied a mountaintop removal mining permit by the @entity147			1
" mountaintop removal is what built this house , sends that little girl to school , provides insurance for my wife , bought two cars and that motorcycle i showed you in the garage			1
i 'm not real impressed , " he says as the marchers pass			0
@entity161 is one of a handful of miners who have joined the protest			0
the retired miner believes more miners would be involved in this march if they were n't afraid			0
" this is a tough situation here			0
this is the only game in town , " he tells us			0
" that is why these people are yelling at us today , because they are brainwashed to think ' oh , i ca n't have a job unless it 's a mountaintop removal job			1
' " " welcome to @entity182 " says a sign greeting the marchers as they cross the @entity181 line			0
three generations of protesters gather at the entrance to a public lake where the marchers plan to camp that night			2
what toddlers , parents and grandparents scream and shout at the protesters can only be described as hateful			2
they seem almost oblivious to our cameraman			0
one mother utters in earshot , " i wonder if they hate us as much as we hate them ? " a toddler at her feet screams , " go home , go home , " as the long line of marchers file by silently			0
we find @entity204 , the wife of a retired miner , at the counter-protest			0
she has defended coal for more than a decade and feels strongly that coal has provided for her family and her community			0
we have met with @entity204 before and visited a mountaintop removal site with her			1
she told us she does n't cry when she sees a mountain being dismantled because she sees " a job in the making			2
" " it 's been wonderful to talk to the opposition with no violence , " @entity204 said along the marchers ' route			2
" peace -- it 's all we want			2
from what i 'm told , they 're not allowed to say anything back			0
we just told them to go home or leave our state alone			0
that 's what we want and that 's from the heart			2
" the marchers arrive at their destination and host a large rally before climbing @entity5			1
one of the speakers is @entity237 , an environmental activist and son of the late sen. @entity239			0
standing nearby , listening to @entity239 , is @entity240			0
he remembers when @entity239 's father came through @entity181 in 1960 campaigning for @entity242 during the presidential election			2
@entity240 is the son of a miner			0
his grandfather died in a @entity181 mine			0
he lives on the same land where he grew up , just behind where @entity204 lives now			0
but his view of mountaintop removal is completely different from hers			1
he is touched when he hears @entity239 's speech , and tells us that it shows people beyond @entity181 care about an issue so important to him			2
" having all these folks come in here gives me hope we can put an end to this type of mining and save our homelands , " he said			2
the new " march on @entity5 " ends in song and celebration at the top of the mountain			1
organizers erect a homemade monument to commemorate the original battle for @entity0 and congratulate the crowd for their long journey			0
in a final act of protest , about 100 marchers break off from the larger group as part of a planned act of civil disobedience			0
they climb over a gate that blocks a dirt road running along the ridge line			0
they attempt to walk out to the edge of a mountaintop removal site that has already encroached on the historic battlefield			1
state police officers pursue the protesters but only arrest one person for trespassing and littering on coal company property			2
march organizer @entity68 sums up the march as a success for raising awareness , but wants to do more to make sure there is no mountaintop mining of @entity0			1
" if you ca n't save this mountain , " he said , " you ca n't save any mountain			2

protesters marched to oppose mountain removal mining on @entity1 's @entity5
supporters say mountaintop removal creates jobs and energy
