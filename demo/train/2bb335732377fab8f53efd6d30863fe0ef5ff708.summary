-- during the weeks of debates triggered by @entity3 and his release of information about a classified @entity6 spying program , the story has moved further and further from the actual surveillance and centered instead on the international cat - and - mouse game to find him			1
what has been remarkable is how @entity12 have expressed little opposition to the surveillance program			1
many @entity12 have simply remained silent as these revelations have emerged while others , like @entity18 sen. @entity17 , have openly defended the program			1
president @entity24 , while initially acknowledging the need for a proper balance between civil liberties and national security , has increasingly focused on defending the government and targeting @entity3			1
when former president @entity28 offered comments that echoed much of the president 's sentiment , some of his supporters could n't help but cringe as these two one - time adversaries came together on the issue of counterterrorism			2
the loss of a @entity37 opposition to the framework of counterterrorism policy has been one of the most notable aspects of @entity24 's term in office			1
although @entity24 ran in 2008 as a candidate who would change the way the government conducted its business and restore a better balance with civil liberties , it has not turned out that way			0
@entity24 has barely dismantled any of the @entity28 programs , and sometimes even expanded their reach in the use of drone strikes and the targeting of @entity59 citizens			0
he has also undertaken an aggressive posture toward those who criticize his program			2
opinion : why we 're all stuck in the digital transit zone with @entity3 equally notable has been how silent many liberals , who once railed against @entity28 for similar activities , have become in recent years			1
whenever @entity24 has encountered conservative pushback for minor efforts to change national security operations , there has been little pressure from liberals for him to move in a different direction			2
if there was any moment when liberals might use a scandal to pressure the president into reforms , this was it			0
but there is little evidence that this will happen			0
where is the outrage ? where has the @entity37 opposition gone ? part of the story simply has to do with political hypocrisy			2
whether or not we like it , partisans tend to be harder on the opposition party than their own			1
this was clear when @entity97 opponents of a strong national security system , who gave then - president @entity101 trouble when he went after home - bred white extremists in 1995 and 1996 in the wake of the @entity106 bombing , remained silent when president @entity28 took the same steps against terrorism after 9/11 -- such as in the use of roving wiretaps on cell phones			1
@entity12 have been reluctant to weaken a president who has moved forward on domestic policies they care about by giving him trouble on an issue where their party has traditionally been vulnerable			0
the silence on national security is also a product of presidential leadership			2
one of the functions of a president , as party leader , is to send strong signals about what the party should focus on			0
when @entity24 backed away from closing @entity131 early in his first term , and has been reluctant to do much about the issues of interrogation and aggressive use of @entity59 power , he made it much harder for @entity37 liberals to do this on their own			2
by embracing so much of president @entity28 's national security program , @entity24 has forged a bipartisan consensus that further marginalized the left and made it harder for them to gain much traction			1
opinion : @entity3 , want my advice ? finally , liberals have been split on this issue			1
the intense animosity toward @entity28 created the appearance of unanimity , but , in reality , divisions loomed all along			0
now that @entity12 have been able to debate national security with their own president in the @entity159 , it is clear that many liberals , like @entity17 , believe the government needs to take these steps			2
efforts to attack the @entity59 , ranging from the failed plot to bomb the @entity166 subways to the @entity168 bombings , have offered a reminder of the chronic risks the nation faces			0
" what do you think would happen if @entity174 was successful ? " @entity17 asked , referring to his effort to bomb a @entity177			0
" there would be unbridled criticism			0
did n't we learn anything ? ca n't we protect our homeland ? " but @entity12 must also remember that too much consensus can lead to bad decisions			0
during the late 1940s and early 1950s , many @entity12 feared being seen as " soft on communism , " and allowed reckless and random attacks on @entity59 accused of allying with the @entity188			0
this dangerously eroded civil liberties and destroyed many lives			0
during the early 1960s , @entity193 's refusal to listen to the many critics of his @entity196 policies led him deeper and deeper into the quagmire of that war			1
and during the late 1990s and early 2000s , @entity37 fears of being seen as weak on defense led to a ratcheting up of concern about @entity203 that helped give @entity28 the political space he needed to send @entity59 troops off to war			0
it is possible that further revelations supplied by @entity3 to @entity211 newspaper 's @entity209 will energize liberal opponents of national security policy and build pressure in @entity215 for serious investigations and possible reform			1
but the odds are slim			0
opinion : @entity59 intelligence community is out of control it 's more likely that most liberal critics of the administration will remain silent and our equivalent of what president @entity227 in 1961 called the military - industrial complex -- the intricate web connecting defense contractors , the military , members of @entity215 and the executive branch -- will continue to grow			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity237 .			1

@entity237 : there 's less *emphasis* on @entity6 spying than @entity3 's *whereabouts*
@entity237 : *democrats* silent on *intrusion* of the surveillance program ; some defend it
@entity237 : partisans are harder on the opposition , but this can be dangerous
he says liberal critics of @entity6 will probably remain silent as *excesses* in security grow
