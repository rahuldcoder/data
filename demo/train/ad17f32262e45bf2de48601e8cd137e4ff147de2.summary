-- it 's no secret that corporate branding is big business			2
but in the age of social media , staying ahead of consumer conversations is an increasing challenge			1
enter @entity8 and his company , @entity9			2
it works on predictive social intelligence -- identifying and predicting emerging topics and conversations before they trend on the internet			1
the company 's propriety technology , aptly named @entity17 , gathers 100 million conversations a day , across six social networks and 50,000 news sources in real time			1
@entity22 , @entity23 - based blab then classifies those conversations into topics			1
companies pay for the predictive data related to each topic			1
@entity0 spoke with @entity8 to find out more about blab and the merits of using predictive technology			2
@entity0 : give us an example of @entity9 and how it works			2
@entity8 : so let 's say you 're an airline and you 're going into spring break , and you 've got a lot of business riding on flights into @entity39			0
all of a sudden , there 's a shark attack in @entity39			0
and the news is something that 's going to move from the news world into the blog world and start resonating with your target audience			1
blab is able to tell that airline this is just a news blip it 's going to last 12 hours and it 's going to not go further than that , or this is going to be a big issue and it 's going to be pervasive 72 hours out			1
so we are really truly a crystal ball , saying here 's how people are going to be dealing with this story that 's hitting the press right now			0
@entity0 : why do companies need to predict conversations on social media ? @entity8 : there 's been a fundamental shift in the way that marketers need to engage customers and it comes down to this : customers are happy operating in real time			1
i learn , i 'm engaged , i 'm excited about living my life in real time			1
but businesses are scared to death to operate in real time ! because when you 're spending millions of dollars in media , you do n't want to be in a reactive state			1
you do n't want to say , " hey , i 'm caught off guard			0
" what we do for them is we shift time			2
we say here 's what will be resonating with your target audience up to 72 hours in the future			0
@entity0 : you say that you 're the first company to do this kind of predictive social intelligence			0
what are the challenges of being an early adopter of new technology ? @entity8 : every start - up has issues it has to overcome			1
with @entity97 , it was my background in advertising			1
i had a vision but i was n't a technologist			0
so i could n't get in my garage and start building this			2
i did n't have venture capitalist connections			0
so it was n't about calling up a friend and saying , fund us without the proof			0
that was the barrier i had to solve in building @entity9 , bring the right founding technology team together , the right angel investors together who would believe in a vision			0
@entity0 : what advice do you have for others who are starting a business ? @entity8 : my advice for entrepreneurs is if you 're driven by a passion and an industry understanding , do your research around financing and investing			0
that is key , that 's the success to getting a company off the ground			0
and keeping a company going .			0
