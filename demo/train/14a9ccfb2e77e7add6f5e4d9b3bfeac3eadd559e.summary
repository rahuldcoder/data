-- how to weigh whether to have another child -- and what to know about raising an " only " couples feel more pressure to have second child than first , says one expert			1
my husband and i decided to be a one - child family long before our son @entity9 was born			1
with several years of reproductive - health scares behind me , conceiving a child felt like a @entity14 win ; i did n't need another chance at the jackpot			1
@entity17 thought we could avoid the inevitable slings and arrows of sibling warfare			2
we both hail from large families , in which continuation of the family name is assured through siblings and cousins			2
we were content with our decision , and our families took it well , too			2
a few months after @entity9 was born , i bagged up my maternity clothes for a tag sale , and @entity17 started researching permanent birth - control options			2
but one afternoon while absentmindedly sorting through blue and green baby clothes , the thought hit me like a punch : " i 'll never sort through pink clothes			2
" for years i 'd imagined myself the mom of a daughter			2
after all , it had been a popular refrain throughout my adolescence ( " i 'll never tell my daughter what i think about her clothes , " i 'd intone to my mother )			2
and i secretly hoped that my daughter would continue the tradition of attending my all - women alma mater			2
it was n't that i was disappointed with a son			1
to be honest , i was relieved the day we found out we were having a boy because i could work the experience of being the older sister to three younger brothers to the fullest			2
hearing the door clang shut on my fantasy daughter , however , made me doubt			2
when acquaintances asked , " so , are you having any more ? " my voice quivered when i answered no. a woman in my local mothers ' group worried aloud , " how would you feel if something happened to @entity9 and you did n't have any more children ? " did i really need another child as an insurance policy ? one night when the anxiety felt particularly overwhelming , i asked @entity17 , " is it okay if we hold off on that vasectomy for a while ? " " it 's normal to wonder if you 're making the right choices and decisions , no matter how many kids you have , " says @entity79 , @entity80 , author of i 'm ok , you 're a brat ! setting the @entity81 and freeing you from the guilt and @entity83			1
" even if you decided to have two or more children , you 'd wonder if your life would have been easier with only one child			1
" choosing to have one @entity88 of @entity89 , @entity90 , mom to @entity92 , 2 , has long planned to have one child			1
" once i understood how much work it takes to have a career and raise a child at the same time , i pretty much decided one was all i could handle , " she says			1
@entity98 says being a one - child family allows her the right balance			1
" it gives me the joy of being a mother , but it 's not too overwhelming to the point where i do n't have any time for myself or my husband , " she says			1
financial barriers were also a factor in their decision			1
" with a mortgage , skyrocketing taxes , and two cars , we have to be a two - income family			2
having another child is financially just not an option for us , " she says			1
at some point , parents will need to ponder : can we cope emotionally and physically with another child ? how will we juggle another child with our jobs ? where do we want to be in three years ? five ? how will another child affect our finances ? what about our marriage ? if we wait any longer to decide , will our choices be limited by our age ? there are social and emotional pressures to consider , too			1
" if your friends are having second -- and third -- children , you can feel left out , " says @entity132 , @entity80 , author of parenting an @entity133			0
" or you or your spouse may want more kids , but the other does n't			1
" sorting out our feelings on most of these things was actually easy for me and @entity17			0
( it was the emotional pull that gave me second thoughts			1
) we have similar goals for the future , and we realized that with our temperaments , one child would be best for our marriage			1
we 're happy for our friends who are having second and third children , but for us , @entity9 completes our family			0
when you do n't have a choice sometimes the twists and turns of life narrow your choices or eliminate them completely			1
@entity161 of @entity162 , @entity163 , always thought having four kids sounded perfect			0
but when her daughter @entity166 was born with life - threatening health problems and @entity161 's uterine fibroids compromised future pregnancies , she and her husband knew @entity166 would be their only child			1
@entity161 says , " raising our daughter was going to take a lot of emotional , physical , and financial resources			1
if i had any more children , i did n't think i could handle it			1
" @entity175 made the situation easier			0
" it 's a process of acceptance , " says @entity161			1
" one thing that was helpful for me was not to focus on the past or the future			0
i put my energy toward making this the brightest moment			0
there were times when we thought @entity166 would n't live , talk , or walk			1
she 's done all those things , so i feel relief and gratitude			0
" answering to everyone as you work out what 's best for your family , you 'll face some tough questions all around : from yourself : @entity195 of @entity196 , @entity163 , mom to @entity197 , 6 , is undecided about having more children			0
" if finances and circumstances ever allow , we might have another child , " she says			1
" but we 're happy the way our family is now			0
" she admits she still has fears			0
" my husband and i both have brothers and sisters -- i ca n't imagine not having them to lean on			1
but after we 're gone , @entity197 will be alone			0
" in my darkest moments , i 've been known to worry about the unthinkable : with no other children , what would i do if i lost @entity9 ? but , of course , parents of onlies do n't own the front and center on worry			1
" parents fear for all their children , " says @entity220			0
" families with a number of children are equally devastated and blown apart when a child dies -- the pain is no less just because you have others			1
" we need to accept that something so dramatic as death is highly unlikely and try not to live our lives in a state of anxiety			0
from others : " the pressure to have a second child is often greater than for the first , " says @entity220			1
but the fact is that the friends , family , and even strangers who are exerting pressure are n't the ones who 'll be caring for these future children till they reach adulthood			1
after @entity161 's daughter was born , she answered her questioners with " we 're going to take care of @entity166			0
" sometimes intrusive questions and opinions can drive us nuts , which is why it can be helpful to look within before lashing out			0
" when you are affected by this pressure , it means you 're looking for that person 's approval , " says @entity255			2
" ask yourself , ' why am i reacting this way ? am i afraid of criticism from this person ? ' as soon as you stop needing their approval , you can relax and appreciate the decision you made			0
" once a mom is feeling calmer , she can answer the critics with , say , " i understand you really want this , but it 's not right for me " or " well , thanks for passing on your ideas			0
" from your child -- it happens : many onlies will ask -- loudly , often -- for a little brother or sister , or wonder aloud why they 're stuck being an only child			2
a straightforward answer is the best bet , says @entity282 , @entity80 , associate director of the @entity283 at the @entity284 in @entity285			0
" the last thing parents want to do is get into a negotiation , " she says			0
instead , respond with something like " we 've decided that our family size is just right			0
there are lots of different kinds of families , and this is how ours is			0
" with an older child , you can point out that many of the advantages he enjoys as an only -- his own specially decorated bedroom , for instance , or the one - on - one time he has with @entity303 -- may be things he would n't have with a brother or sister			1
you can also try asking your child what he thinks would be the benefits of having a sibling			2
it could be as simple as having a bunk bed			0
if a child 's demands do n't abate , @entity255 points out that " children complain , period			1
" parents with two or three kids sometimes hear , " @entity319 , it 's time to send the baby back to the hospital			0
" in my case , it took me time to say goodbye to my fantasy daughter , but when @entity9 was 18 months old , i finally said to @entity17 , " let 's do it , " on the vasectomy			0
i 'm very happy with my son and our decision , and i 've looked for other ways to indulge my daughter needs			0
i volunteered as a big sister and counseled a 15 - year - old on boyfriends			0
when i spot cute girly - girl dresses , i buy them for my friend 's daughters			0
and i console myself that when i go through menopause , there wo n't be two hormonal women under this roof			2
