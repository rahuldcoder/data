-- clinging to @entity2 's rugged east coast is a golf course so tough it once reduced @entity5 to tears			1
just imagine what it could do to a hopeless weekend hacker			2
aspiring basketball players may struggle to ever play at @entity11 , but one of the world 's most historic golf courses is open to all comers			1
@entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 have walked its fairways			2
and so have i. that 's the beauty of golf ; you do n't have to imagine			1
if you 've got $ 220 spare you can take your clubs to @entity27 and discover firsthand why the locals call it " @entity29			1
" " we get golfers of all abilities , from pros to relative beginners , " said @entity30 , who 's been a caddy at @entity27 for 30 years			1
" you just hope they can relax and enjoy it			2
" this relative beginner was far from relaxed as i stood before the packed clubhouse terrace , preparing for the most terrifying tee shot of my life			1
" watch out for the thick rough on the right , the out of bounds to the left and the bunkers up ahead , " said my caddy with no hint of irony			2
she did n't mention that there were also a hundred or so people standing by ready to burst into laughter if the predicted shank ensued			0
" it 's all about having realistic expectations , " said @entity55 , who caddied for @entity18 at the 1996 @entity56			1
" the problem a lot of golfers have is they want to go home and tell their friends ' i shot a 69 at @entity27 , ' but it 's not going to happen			1
" i 've had golfers throwing clubs in frustration -- and even heard of people walking off the course in the middle of a round			0
they want to play to their handicap , but they do n't realize how much more difficult that is here			1
" @entity27 has hosted seven @entity79 opens and is regularly ranked the most difficult golf course on the planet			1
in 1999 conditions were so tough a 19 - year - old @entity5 had to be comforted by his mother after shooting an 89			1
but that does n't put off the thousands of golfing tourists who make the pilgrimage every year			0
" amateur golfers want to play famous courses like @entity27 and @entity92 whatever the weather , " said @entity88 , who owns tour operator @entity89			1
" they know to expect a tough time on the links courses , but they 're prepared for it			1
and they must be enjoying it , because they keep coming back			0
we 've never had an unsatisfied customer			0
" my round started with a double - bogey six , which my caddy tactfully told me was still one better than @entity5 managed in 1999			1
but that was where the rain started and the comparison ended			0
@entity111 - zagging the fairways and finding almost every pot bunker on the course , i got the full " @entity29 " experience			2
my poor caddy was put through quite an ordeal , but as it turns out it could have been worse			0
" i once had a guy turn up on a corporate day who 'd never hit a ball in his life , " @entity30 said			0
" he was wearing @entity125 work boots and he really hacked it up the first			0
i think he scored 160 - odd in the end , and that was without me calling any of the penalties on him			2
" caddies actually enjoy that kind of thing			0
we have a warped sense of humor and we like to see who can caddy the worst score			0
the all - time record is something like 180 i think			2
" my @entity27 experience culminated in a sunset walk down the last , the scene of @entity146 's infamous implosion at the 1999 @entity147 , where the likes of @entity16 , @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 lifted the iconic @entity152			1
suddenly a torrid day on the golf course made perfect sense			0
when a weekend hacker gets the chance to walk in the footsteps of golfing legend it really does n't matter what your card looks like ( for the record this 20 handicapper hit 108 )			0
if it does , you 're in for a miserable time			0
" some golfers beat themselves up when they should be relaxing and enjoying it , " @entity30 said			0
" but at least they do n't take it out on the caddies			0

@entity27 's @entity172 was named the most difficult in the world by @entity174
