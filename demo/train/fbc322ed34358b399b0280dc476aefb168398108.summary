she is n't forgotten but it 's safe to say that @entity3 has n't been in tennis ' spotlight in the last year			1
@entity3 only played 15 matches in 2014 after last year 's @entity8 thanks to injuries to both feet and a right knee			1
and unsurprisingly , her ranking has tumbled from no. 2 to outside the top 40			2
twice a champion in @entity16 , the 25 - year - old entered her first - round encounter against @entity19 unseeded			1
@entity19 has also seen better days , including in 2013 when the pair met not in the first round but in the semifinals at the year 's opening major			1
it was perhaps the most enticing first - round tussle of the tournament but @entity3 ensured the hype bettered the actual match as she eased past the @entity28 -- whose tag of next - big - thing in women 's tennis is n't yet materializing -- 6 - 3 6 - 2 in 75 minutes			1
@entity3 wo n't be in the shadows much longer if she can replicate tuesday 's performance			1
" from the beginning i started to be pretty focused and just maintained that intensity , " @entity3 told reporters			1
" so that was a good opportunity to just really at the beginning take my chances because she 's the kind of player that likes to take her chances			2
" there is a lot to build from here			2
" indeed @entity3 can take heart from her display but she knows she wo n't have much time to dwell on it , since her second - round foe is longtime pal and @entity52 finalist @entity51			1
the @entity53 upended another young @entity28 , @entity54 , 7 - 6 ( 7 - 2 ) 6 - 2			1
" being an unseeded player , it 's not a surprise that i have a tough draw or tough opponents in the early round , " said @entity3			1
" i just need to go through that			2
" she was showing some great tennis in the end of last year			0
i know she 's very dangerous			0
we always had some of tough matches			0
i would like to focus on myself and what i can do to build my game , to prepare as best as i can , and just compete			0
" that 's my key word for this tournament : compete			0
" besides being former no. 1 players , @entity3 and @entity51 share another thing in common -- going through high - profile splits last year			1
whereas @entity51 and golfer @entity76 broke up , @entity3 and artist @entity77 went their separate ways			1
@entity3 trails @entity51 4 - 3 in their head - to - heads , although they 've only played one full match since 2010 , a victory for the @entity85 in @entity86 in 2013			1
" it 's going to be tough , " @entity51 said			1
" she 's won here before			0
not the easiest on paper			0
" but at the same time i 'm just going to focus on myself , my own game			0
honestly whether you have to beat her in the second round or fourth round , whatever , does n't matter if you want to win the tournament			1
" women 's top - seed @entity96 began with a 6 - 0 6 - 4 win over @entity101 's @entity100 -- escaping a 0 - 30 hole on serve at 4 - 4 in the second set -- and reigning @entity105 champion @entity104 eliminated @entity107 qualifier @entity108 6 - 1 6 - 4			1
@entity104 was relieved , since she fell to an outsider in the first round last year			2
" i 'm glad that i did better than last year , " @entity104 told reporters			0
" of course , i mean , the nerves were there			0
" during all match , i was still feeling the tightness and the legs were suddenly so heavy and i could n't really move			0
it was difficult , but i 'm glad i did it			0
" @entity122 , @entity121 move on on paper , world no. 1 @entity121 and defending champion @entity122 are due to meet in the semifinals , and both began with three - set wins			1
@entity122 , who stunned @entity121 last year on the way to opening his grand slam account , routed @entity130 's @entity129 6 - 1 6 - 4 6 - 2 while @entity121 defeated @entity132 's @entity131 -- a runner - up to @entity122 in @entity134 this month -- 6 - 3 6 - 2 6 - 4 after a slow start			1
" i was happy to be back on the court , " @entity122 told reporters			2
" i can feel that i have a lot of support here , and it 's always nice to come back like that and to feel the crowd behind you			0
" for sure it 's great , but it 's still the beginning of the tournament			0
it 's just one match , now i need to be ready for the next one			0
" @entity52 finalist @entity149 , meanwhile , downed 2013 quarterfinalist @entity150 of @entity152 6 - 4 7 - 6 ( 1 ) 6 - 2			2
@entity150 , whose ranking has plummeted from the top 15 because of foot and shoulder injuries , hit 50 unforced errors			0
home fans had plenty of reason to cheer monday after the likes of @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 won , and tuesday brought more success			0
@entity167 's top - ranked player , @entity166 -- who has struggled at the @entity8 -- beat @entity169 's @entity168 6 - 4 6 - 1 , with @entity170 getting the better of @entity172 's @entity171 6 - 3 1 - 6 6 - 0 6 - 4			2
@entity170 , 33 , set a tournament record when he stepped on court , making his 19th straight appearance			2
he continues to play tennis in the aftermath of several serious injuries .			0

@entity3 crushes @entity19 in @entity16
@entity3 now faces @entity51 , who topped another young @entity28
@entity122 begins his title defense with a straight - sets win
@entity121 , @entity96 also ease into the second round
