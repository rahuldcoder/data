@entity0 -- whatever one thinks of @entity4 's expletive - laced rant about moneyed newcomers inhabiting once - blighted corners of @entity8 's most populous city , the millionaire filmmaker could be considered a dubious messenger for such sentiments			1
" you personally turned @entity12 into the hottest spot creatively and politically and you move out , " @entity11 , a @entity12 resident and political anchor at @entity1 affiliate @entity14 , said thursday			1
" what did you think was going to happen ? you got rich selling this place			0
this is your brand and people who have a little money want to sort of take you up on it , and somehow that 's a problem			0
" the famed director 's lengthy tirade on the dickensian ills of gentrification during an @entity29 lecture tuesday has drawn mixed reactions from various sectors of a rapidly changing city			1
" you ca n't just come in the neighborhood like you 're @entity38 and kill off the @entity39 , " @entity4 told his audience after a @entity12 resident raised the subject of the " other side " of gentrification			1
@entity42 , in an opinion piece in the @entity41 on wednesday , called out @entity4			2
" it 's the sacred right of every @entity0 to bewail , blame and bemoan the arrival of the folks who arrive in the neighborhood five minutes after we do , but somebody has to call bull on @entity4 's complaints about gentrification , " he wrote			1
" this is a man who has made epic contributions to the phenomenon he finds so troubling			1
" case in point : @entity61 , @entity4 's 9,000 - square - foot mansion on @entity60 's ritzy @entity59 , @entity11 writes			1
the filmmaker bought the palace from artist @entity64 for $ 16 million in 2006 and recently put it on the market for $ 32 million			0
@entity4 bought a five - story townhouse in @entity67 -- where the director grew up -- for $ 650,000 in 1990 , according to published reports			2
@entity4 sold the place in 1999 to a banker married to an attorney for about $ 1 million and moved to his @entity59 mansion			2
@entity4 also put his 40 acres headquarters , a converted former firehouse in @entity12 , up for sale at $ 6 million in 2008 , published reports said			1
" he 's like a one - man marketing organization and he 's brilliant at it , " @entity11 , who has lived in @entity12 for three decades , told @entity1			2
on wednesday , @entity4 told " @entity82 " that he 's not against new people moving into areas that were once predominantly poor and predominantly @entity81			2
" my problem is that when you move into a neighborhood , have some respect for the history , for the culture , " @entity4 said			0
@entity89 , a professor of urban policy and planning at @entity93 's @entity92 , said some of @entity0 's most dilapidated neighborhoods have benefited from the city 's enormous recovery since 2001			1
for example , many renovated sections of now trendy @entity101 , @entity12 , were vacant industrial spaces			0
abandoned buildings in @entity104 have been turned into attractive apartment houses			0
" in many cases , " @entity89 said , " we have populations that are growing where there were no people before			0
" @entity112 , the @entity12 homeowner and tech start - up director who asked the question that triggered @entity4 's tirade , on thursday said that he looks forward to possibly partnering with the filmmaker to keep the gentrification debate going			1
" people are concerned about the issue of affordable housing , " he said			0
" where are people going to go ? @entity123 made the point , ' i do n't want to live in a city where every house is a $ 1 million or $ 3 million			0
' first of all , it 's not going to be much of a city			0
we 're going to lose the part of the city that makes it vibrant			0
" he added : " i imagine there are many elitists who would love to be in a city where the cheapest house is $ 1 million , but what kind of city would that be ? it certainly would n't be @entity12 , and it certainly would n't be the @entity0 we have now			1
