-- it was a horrifying front - page photo in every sense of the word			0
it felt cheap , degrading and exploitative in a way that words could never match			1
the photo captures a @entity9 man , @entity10 - @entity8 , after he had been pushed onto the subway tracks monday as an oncoming train roared toward him			1
the screaming headline says it all : " doomed			0
" but the @entity16 had every right to run the picture			1
this is what tabloids do -- milk tragedy for every ounce of emotional impact			0
no @entity25 straphanger should have been surprised to see the photo			1
perspective : ' outraged ' at @entity29 death photo a typical reaction : " sickening rubber - necking front page from the @entity16			1
imagine how this man 's family feels , " tweeted an editor at @entity33			2
that , of course , is the normal human response			1
it also explains why @entity41 's paper did it , knowing that everyone in @entity25 would be gripped by the image			1
watch : is the @entity16 harassing @entity45 in alleged stalker case ? no one would dispute that the story is newsworthy			1
it is , in fact , every @entity25 's nightmare			1
perhaps you have to have spent much of your life crowding onto narrow platforms with total strangers and trying to squeeze onto overcrowded subway cars , to understand the every - day fear that you could be groped , mugged or pushed into danger			2
watch : @entity60 's @entity59 courted @entity61 for possible presidential run why , then , the visceral sense of revulsion ? it 's fine to look down your nose at the @entity16 for showing such a horrific picture , to say it was grossly unethical			1
but what about all the media outlets that show equally horrific pictures from war zones ? we 've seen bloodied children in @entity76 , @entity80 police machine - gunned by the @entity79 , bodies being thrown off roofs in @entity82			0
and we 're horrified by a picture of a man who is about to die in @entity25 ? what 's the difference ? is it any worse because it happens in the @entity88 ? the truth is that this picture seems more monstrously unfair because we can easily imagine being in the victim 's place			1
we may complain about it , but if it 's so clearly out of bounds , why have so many websites and television networks now run it ? for the @entity16 to run it was unfair to @entity8 's family , but the media do n't usually worry about such things			1
it was accurate and captured an important story			0
watch : are tv newsbabes dressing sexy for ratings ? it was insensitive -- hard to imagine the photo running in the @entity109 -- but people buy the @entity16 for punch - in - the - gut tales , for the " headless body in topless bar , " not for astute foreign policy analysis			2
the story is so sickening that we want to turn away but ca n't			2
the picture makes us so uncomfortable that we 're mad at the @entity16 for inflicting it on us			2
there are pictures of murder victims in the paper every day , part of the sad toll of urban life			0
but the difference is that we 're not watching them being shot or stabbed			0
watch : media embrace cop who bought boots for homeless man one aspect of this tale that makes my blood boil is the role of the freelance photographer , @entity136			0
instead of snapping two pictures of a man about to die , why did n't he try to pull him to safety ? @entity136 claims he hoped the flash would warn the subway driver			1
i 'm not buying it			0
his first instinct was to record death , not prevent it			0
every editor has to strike a balance between depicting ugly reality and the sensibilities of readers and viewers			0
there are those who believe that the @entity88 media should run more pictures of dead or wounded soldiers , that we -- especially in television news -- sanitize war by shying away from showing its victims			0
would i have run the front - page photo of @entity8 ? no way			0
but the @entity16 has a different mission , to shock and sensationalize , especially when it comes to crime			2
on that point , the tabloid succeeded , which is why so many people are angry -- and everyone is buzzing about it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity176 .			2

@entity176 : @entity16 ran degrading , exploitative pic of man about to be hit by subway
human response is one of horror , and reason paper did it : to grip @entity25 , he says
he says it 's newsworthy for a tab , but worse offense is photog who did n't seem to help
@entity176 : @entity16 sensationalizes to sell papers and succeeded , but he would n't have run it
