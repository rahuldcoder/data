-- i 've always found amusement parks very unamusing , for it 's hard to justify standing in a hot , 40 - minute roller - coaster line so i can promptly lose my car keys and barf up a churro			1
that 's what whiskey is for			1
but lots of people dig this kind of entertainment			0
and it seems all the theme parks around the world try to out - amuse each other with technologically advanced new rides promising wild and exciting fun			2
" hey kids ! come try the @entity22 ! it will literally give you second - degree steam burns to the face ! " you see , when it comes to roller coasters these days , they have to be @entity32 extreme to stand out			0
and , right now , thrill seekers on the @entity34 are all talking about @entity35 at @entity36 in @entity37			1
the ride opened last weekend to rave reviews , and it 's being touted as the " world 's tallest and fastest looping coaster			1
" which sounds pretty amazing , save for the part about it being tall and fast and looping			0
my ideal roller coaster is a hammock			2
nevertheless , this thing goes up to 70 mph , reaches a height of 160 feet and uses something called a linear synchronous - motor magnetic launch system			1
i do n't know what that means , but i 'm fairly certain it causes diarrhea			0
" did anybody else just ... ? " " yes			0
" @entity35 also prides itself on having the world 's first ever " top hat " loop , allowing riders to fly across the outer rail of the circle as well as the inside			1
everything i 've read suggests that this is actually a rather big deal when it comes to roller - coaster engineering			2
though , to be fair , i 'm still trying to figure out button - fly jeans			0
so , in my book , pretty much anything more sophisticated than a ballpoint pen counts as an major scientific accomplishment			0
hell , my ceiling fan is certifiably magic			0
anyway , never mind all the wild technology			0
just know that @entity35 is really big and really fast , and if the train ever flies off the rails , there 's a pretty good chance you 'll end up somewhere near @entity82			1
now that 's what i call being thrown for a loop ! " " shut up , @entity87			1
" and if the overall speed and height were n't wild enough , @entity35 also minimizes the protective harnessing that prevents you from dropping painfully to your death			1
which , to some , might be slightly concerning			0
here , there 's nothing covering your chest -- just a simple lap bar to keep you and your bladder snugly in position			2
but it 's said to be very advanced , and the limited upper - body protection totally enhances the fear factor when , at one point during the ride , you apparently almost slow to a stop along a curve			2
it 's a terrifying pause that lasts just long enough to make a deathbed confession to the stranger sitting next to you			2
" these are the dirty secrets we share when roller - coaster technology rises to the next level			0
@entity120 , director of maintenance , construction and engineering for @entity36 , was the project lead for creating @entity35 , and told @entity124 that , " anyone can take a track and flip it			1
i 've done it a million times -- it 's easy to do			0
but to build an actual loop , with all the supporting structure , and the dynamics you have to do to be at 160 feet , that is a much ( more ) difficult thing			1
" if this all sounds completely amazing , it is			0
roller - coaster engineering continues to test the limits of your lunch , and @entity36 has quite literally raised the bar			1
so , if you 're an adrenaline junkie and you make it out to @entity37 , make sure you head over to @entity36 to give this thing a shot			1
because i 'll be in my hammock , confidently eating a churro .			0
