-- i 've never been one to attend the performances of symphony orchestras , but off and on , for more than 35 years , i gave myself the gift of something even better : @entity6 received the @entity7 from president @entity8 in 2005			1
i would go and sit with @entity6 as he broadcast his radio show			1
it was music ; it was thrilling			1
i met him in the early 1970s , when i was a young newspaper reporter in @entity12 , and that 's when he allowed me , for the first time , to sit silently in his studio as he did his work			2
over the years , whenever i felt a need for a @entity6 fix , he was always welcoming , and we came to know each other well			1
i would sit there wordlessly and observe absolute excellence			2
he would invariably be wearing a smock when i arrived -- he had been working since well before the sun came up , and the smock would cover his shirt and tie			2
it was the kind of smock a jeweler might wear , or a watchmaker -- it was crisply pressed , the uniform of an expert craftsman			1
i never asked him why he wore it , but i suspect that was the reason -- pride in craftsmanship			2
he would be at the typewriter , honing his script			2
he was famed for his voice , but the writing itself was so beautiful -- his respect for words , his understanding of the potency of economy , his instinct for removing the superfluous			1
the world heard him speak , but the world never saw him write , and i think he honored both aspects of his skill equally			2
he would walk down the hallway to his studio just minutes before airtime			2
the studio itself -- when i first knew him it was on the west side of @entity61 , and in later years he moved it to the east side of the street -- was far from lavish			0
it was impossible to equate the spartan surroundings with the idea that his voice was leaving this little room and traveling around the world			0
maybe that was the point : he worked for the illusion of unfussy intimacy			0
he would make these warm - up noises -- voice exercises , silly - sounding tweets and yodels , strange little @entity79 - like sounds -- and he showed no self - consciousness about doing it in front of someone else , because would a @entity84 linebacker be self - conscious about someone seeing him stretch before a game , would a @entity73 forward be worried about someone seeing him leap up and down before tipoff ? this was @entity6 's arena , and he would get the voice ready , loosening it , easing it up to the starting line			1
and then the signal from the booth , and			0
" hello , @entity97 ! this is @entity6 ! stand by			1
for news ! " and he would look down at those words that had come out of his typewriter minutes before -- some of them underlined to remind him to punch them hard -- and they became something grander than ink on paper , they became the song , the @entity6 symphony			1
he would allow me to sit right with him in the little room -- he never made me watch from behind the glass -- and there were moments , when his phrases , his word choices , were so perfect -- flawlessly written , flawlessly delivered -- that i just wanted to stand up and cheer			1
but of course i never did any such thing -- in @entity6 's studio , if you felt a tickle in your throat you would begin to panic , because you knew that if you so much as coughed it would go out over the air into cities and towns all across the continent -- so there were never any cheers			1
the impulse was always there , though -- when he would drop one of those famous @entity6 pauses into the middle of a sentence , letting it linger , proving once again the power of pure silence , the tease of anticipation , you just wanted to applaud for his mastery of his life 's work			1
ireport.com : share your memories of radio legend @entity6 he probably would n't have thought of himself this way , but he was the ultimate singer - songwriter			1
and then he went onto his stage and performed them			0
the cadences that came out of his fingertips at the typewriter were designed to be translated by one voice -- his voice -- and he did it every working day for more than half a century : did it so well that he became a part of the very atmosphere , an element of the @entity97 air			0
he had difficult years toward the end			0
at one point there was a problem with his vocal cords , and he had to leave his broadcast for an extended period ; when he came back he told me he had felt fear and the deepest kind of despondency , because he thought he might be finished			0
he was n't ; he was able to work again , and then in the last 12 months he became ill , and his beloved wife , @entity174 , died ; he turned 90 and he was n't on the air as much			0
i was in @entity176 last fall to cover the vice presidential debate , and i was taking a morning walk through the suburb of @entity180			0
i was on @entity181 , on a sidewalk beneath some old and thick trees , and the cell phone in my pocket rang			0
i did n't know exactly why he was calling that day , and i still am not certain , but my sense was that he just felt a need to talk			0
this was during the time when his radio appearances had become sporadic ; i knew how lonely he was without mrs. @entity79			0
the voice , of course , was much older , and not as strong , but it was his voice , arriving out of the air in yet another @entity97 town , and what i said to him then is what i will say to you now : it was wonderful to hear it again			0
i walked down the street , his voice in my ear			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			1

@entity206 : i was *privileged* to watch @entity6 prepare and deliver the news
he says @entity6 wrote his own scripts and was a master of spare language
@entity206 : @entity6 was a craftsman who words were flawlessly delivered
