-- how can it be that the number of vulnerable and abandoned children is increasing and the numbers of children finding their " forever families " through adoption is decreasing ? i can not get my head around this shocking fact			1
what happens to all these kids who desperately need someone to advocate for their very existence ? where do they go ? who do they turn to ? how do they survive ? there are an estimated 151 million orphans in the world , which @entity22 defines as a child that 's lost one or more parent			1
if they were a country , they would together form the 10th largest nation in the world			0
an estimated 18 million of those have lost both parents -- a figure which would represent 80 % of the population of my home country , @entity36			1
i try to imagine what that visual looks like , if one were to @entity39 it and hone in on one face staring back at you , wondering if there is anyone out there that cares about them and their circumstance			0
i am not a learned scholar or professional worker in international adoption			1
i am not even an adoption advocate -- i am a child advocate			1
i am an individual who has witnessed what life is like for children who do n't have anyone to watch their back , or teach them right from wrong , to care about what they think or feel , or the basic human need to feel loved , to feel safe and secure and to feel that they actually matter			1
i believe everyone deserves be the object of someone 's affection			0
this journey for me began six years ago when i addressed an article i read in my local newspaper in @entity36 about adoption			1
after speaking with the paper and getting the headline the next day , i realized this issue needed a voice in @entity36			1
many people from the community implored me to keep speaking as there was so much frustration surrounding adoption			1
the main grievance for families was the difficultly to adopt in @entity36 , where couples could wait as long as 10 years			1
i am still talking six years on , having established @entity84			1
it 's a no brainer for me : you have loving families wanting to care for these kids and kids that desperately need a loving home			0
we just have to work out a way to put these two together			0
in my mind one of the greatest crimes of humanity is to take away the innocence of a child , and this is in essence what we are doing if we do not step up and take a look at what is happening to abandoned children all over the world			2
these kids have literally no self - esteem , they are depressed and without hope and often in extreme danger of exploitation and abuse			0
if they are not able to be placed with a permanent family , they are either on the streets and prey to abusive predators or being institutionalized and therefore subject to serious mental health and developmental issues			0
many are caught in the foster care system , whereby they are always vulnerable to being moved from family to family and never have a sense of belonging			2
the lack of permanency for these kids has a huge effect on their safety and security			0
sadly , the trajectory for many kids who age out of the foster care system is homelessness , crime , drugs and incarceration , to name a few of the horrors			0
these kids are stuck , because governments can not work out how to parent them			2
intercountry adoption is vulnerable because of corruption of the system			1
profiteering and child trafficking has understandably caused great concern and is the reason why @entity150 on @entity151 was created to combat such abuse			0
but it should not be the reason to close down programs that serve so many children			2
greater measures of accountability need to be in place to combat the rotten part of the system , but do n't throw the baby out with the bathwater			0
what needs to be addressed is the systemic core of the sending countries			0
we need to assist countries that have been rife with poverty and war and lack of education for decades			0
until we can get at the core of why there are so many young women and unborn / newborn babies with no real support , they will always be vulnerable			2
by getting to the root of the problems , there is the possibility of creating an environment that will serve families and there will be fewer abandoned children that need to find another family			1
my dream would be that there would be no need for adoption and that every child could remain with birth families			2
when adoption is the best option for these kids , i totally advocate for a well - run system that serves these children and families i believe the biggest reason that intercountry adoption does not work at an optimum is because we have not put in the mind power and energy and resources needed to create a system that works ethically and expediently			1
some governments do n't rate abandoned childrens ' issues high on their agenda , unless children are being used as a political pawn , as we witnessed late last year when @entity214 closed down their program with the @entity216 even the @entity214 children 's rights commissioner made a statement saying " i think any foreign adoption is bad for the country			1
" bad for the " country , " not specifically bad for the " children			2
" thousands of children will have to pay the hefty price of that decision , as they will be institutionalized for the remainder of their childhood , never finding a family of their own			2
i implore everyone to speak up on this matter			0
you do n't have to adopt a child to show that you care			0
just by acknowledging their existence and maybe doing something as simple as taking a minute to think about their plight may lead to a movement , a change , a chance for a better life .			0

@entity245 : number of children *globally* who have lost both parents nearly equals population of @entity36
while vulnerable to corruption , the problems of *overseas* adoption should be solved , not *shuttered*
governments like @entity214 have used international adoption as a political chess piece with the @entity216
@entity245 established @entity84 to shed light on the orphan plight
