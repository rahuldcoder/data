-- the parties activists organized to watch president @entity3 's immigration speech were supposed to be festive affairs			1
but @entity5 said he did n't feel much like smiling thursday night , even though @entity3 's new plan will give him a chance to avoid deportation and find a better job			1
" people are crying , " he told @entity0 in a phone interview from @entity11			0
" i ca n't celebrate this , because there are a lot of people left out			1
" the @entity17 estimates nearly 5 million people will benefit from @entity3 's new executive action			1
but that 's less than half of the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country , @entity5 said			2
before the highly anticipated speech thursday night , reactions were already mixed -- even among the millions of people directly affected by his announcement			2
the president 's plan to bypass @entity31 is a controversial move that has riled @entity34 leaders who say @entity3 is overstepping his constitutional bounds			1
it has also come under fire from those who want a more extensive overhaul and drawn swift opposition from critics , who call it an unfair amnesty that rewards lawbreakers			0
after the speech , confusion surrounding what comes next showed no sign of slowing			2
cheers erupted at a rally outside the @entity17			0
some people seemed stunned ; others , overjoyed			1
" i want to cry tears of happiness , " said @entity53 , a 32 - year - old mom from @entity54 who watched the speech at a party in @entity57			1
because her 6 - year - old daughter is a @entity61 citizen and she 's been in the @entity61 for more than five years , @entity53 is among the millions who @entity3 said can step out of the shadows if they submit to a background check and pay back taxes			1
after years of living in constant fear of being deported , she said @entity3 's announcement gave her hope that she will watch her daughter grow up and succeed			1
" this is a great relief , " she said , " a victory , an obstacle that we have overcome			0
" ' my head hurts ' at another watch party in @entity78 , @entity76 said his head was spinning			0
for years , the @entity81 immigrant has been on the front lines of immigration activism in the @entity61 , pushing for reforms in @entity78 while continuing his graduate studies at @entity86 , where he also ran for student body president			1
in 2012 , he was elated after qualifying for @entity3 's program that stopped the deportation of the so - called dreamers , young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the @entity61 as children			1
" now , maybe i will be able to work without being afraid that someone may deport me , " he told @entity0 at the time			0
" there is no fear anymore			0
" on thursday , he hoped he 'd be able to call his mother and giver her the same good news			0
but the parents of @entity91 were n't included in new rules @entity3 outlined			1
" my head hurts , because my mother does n't benefit from this			2
and i am where i am because of my mother			0
and everything that i do is because of her , " @entity76 said			0
" i just got off the phone with her , and those five minutes seemed so long			0
but she told me , ' we 've got to keep fighting			0
' " ' it 's what we were waiting for ' at first , @entity110 did n't believe it			1

" they 've been talking about this for years , " he said			0
" i do n't take it very seriously			2
my wife is happy about it			0
but we are always realistic			0
" on thursday night , the 48 - year - old undocumented immigrant , who asked that only his first name be used , said he 'd listened to the speech with his family in their south @entity125 home			2
" i feel good , a little excited , not just for me , but for many others , " he said			0
" it 's what we were waiting for			2
" @entity110 has been living in the @entity61 for 14 years after leaving his home in @entity54 in search of better job prospects			1
he found them , and he 's worked on farms harvesting onions and packing pine straw for more than a decade			2
his 9 - year - old daughter , the youngest of his three children , is a @entity61 citizen , making him and his wife eligible under the new measure			0
and they plan to speak with an immigration lawyer and apply to use @entity3 's plan as soon as possible			1
still , he said , they know everything could change with the stroke of a future president 's pen			1
later they could change their policies and deport us more easily , or something like that			0
it 's difficult because we do n't know what ideas others will have , " he said			1
@entity110 's 18 - year - old daughter @entity159 is among the more than half a million @entity91 who received deferred action under @entity3 's 2012 rule			1
but without relief for her parents , she told @entity0 last year it was " like being out in the cold and me having the only blanket in the family			0
" after thursday 's speech , she said she was hopeful things might change dramatically soon			1
" the fear of being separated wo n't be there anymore , and that 's the biggest thing we just want to get rid of , " she said			1
but she 's still waiting			2
" i wo n't be truly happy until i can see it happen , " she said			2
" one thing is to hear it , and the other thing is to actually see it			0

" i have been here since i was 12 -- 21 years			0
for somebody to just say , ok , now it is ok			0
