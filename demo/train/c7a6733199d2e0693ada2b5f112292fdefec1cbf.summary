-- february 10 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 transcript this is a @entity9			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity13 , @entity14 : dedicating today 's show to our @entity17 fans at @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21			1
thanks for your " likes " at @entity17 / @entity24 ! i 'm @entity26 , your captain of current events on this february 10th , 2011			2
first up : @entity4 in crisis @entity29 : for @entity4 president @entity31 , things are going pretty much like they normally would			1
yesterday , he met with members of his government and officials from other countries			2
but on the streets of @entity37 , things are anything but normal			2
thousands of protesters jamming the downtown area for the 16th day in a row			2
these people are mad at the government and they want @entity31 out of office now			2
the @entity4 vice president met with some of these protesters and promised that things will change			1
but there are concerns -- and not just from @entity4 -- that those changes are n't happening quickly enough			1
here 's @entity0 's @entity50			1
( begin video ) @entity52 , @entity0 pentagon correspondent : with crowds swelling in @entity37 's @entity54 , a greater sense of urgency from the @entity57 that the @entity4 government needs to show change is coming			1
in a phone call , @entity57 vice president @entity60 telling @entity4 vice president @entity62 there must be a transition with " immediate , irreversible progress			1
" @entity66 , white house press secretary : vice president @entity62 made some particularly unhelpful comments about @entity4 not being ready for democracy , about not seeing a lift of the emergency law			1
and i do n't , i do n't think that in any way squares with what those seeking greater opportunity and freedom think is a timetable for progress			2
@entity81 : but a calmer approach from the @entity83 , where sources say they are easing back from crisis atmosphere			2
@entity86 , @entity57 secretary of defense : i think the @entity4 military has conducted itself in exemplary fashion during this entire episode			1
and they have acted with great restraint			2
@entity81 : @entity94 analyst @entity93 says the @entity57 government message has changed from immediate action to a more protracted process			1
a process that is unclear			2
@entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 : president @entity102 has been calling for a transition to begin now			2
on the other hand , we hear secretary @entity106 a couple of days ago saying we support the process laid about by vice president @entity62 , which is not a process the opposition has agreed to at all			0
@entity81 : there is a growing concern the man the @entity57 is supporting , the new @entity4 vice president , is not on the same page @entity116 : up until now , the @entity102 administration was saying that this had to be a negotiated transition , that the @entity4 government had to deal with the opposition and that the opposition had to be a partner , so to speak , in this transition			1
what @entity62 is offering right now is not that at all			0
( @entity126 ) more @entity127 @entity29 : weather report is starting to sound like a broken record , and that does n't make dealing with it any easier			0
yes , there is yet another round of winter storms moving across the country			0
this is what @entity137 looked like on tuesday , parts of the city getting up to 12 inches of snow			0
and this is just one week after that massive winter storm we reported on hammered the region			0
there are winter weather alerts from @entity6 all the way to the @entity149 , with forecasts for rain , wind , snow and sleet through the rest of the week			1
@entity156 @entity157 , federal reserve chairman : the economic recovery that began in the middle of 2009 appears to have strengthened in the past few months , although the unemployment rate remains high			0
state of the economy @entity29 : well , you 've heard of the president 's @entity167 speech			1
yesterday , @entity168 chairman @entity157 gave a kind of " state of the economy " address to @entity173			0
and as you heard , he did n't really offer a simple thumbs up or thumbs down			0
it was kinda like a " thumbs sideways			0
" talking to the @entity179 , chairman @entity157 said @entity173 needs to make big changes to help stabilize the economy			0
the @entity168 has taken its own steps to try to get things going in the right direction			0
but some members of @entity173 , including the chairman of the budget committee , disagree with the @entity168 's actions			1
and they let @entity157 know how they felt during yesterday 's hearing			1
@entity191 @entity192 , @entity14 : today 's shoutout goes out to ms. @entity195 's class at @entity196 in @entity197 , @entity196 ! name the region in @entity21 that 's home to many of @entity57 's high - tech industries			1
is it : a ) @entity203 , b ) magnificent mile , c ) @entity205 or @entity206 ) @entity5 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! @entity5 is where you 'll find a center of @entity57 information technology			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity5 's projected growth @entity29 : the name comes from silicon being a main component in computer circuits			1
you heard chairman @entity157 a moment ago mention the economic recovery			0
there are signs of that in @entity5 , and it has to do with web sites that a lot of us visit every day			1
@entity228 looks at some of the businesses that are on the rise in the valley			0
( begin video ) @entity234 , @entity0 correspondent : @entity17 is getting a new home address , the company announcing that it 's taking over nearly eighty acres of property here in @entity238 , @entity21			1
it 's taking over the former campus , which was held by @entity240			1
@entity17 also announcing that it 's going to be adding about a thousand workers over the next twelve months			1
and industry observers say it 's sort of a barometer of what you 're seeing here in @entity5			1
@entity248 announcing just last week it 's adding six thousand people to its workforce			1
and what you 're seeing is basically three sectors where the hirings are taking place			0
when it comes to social networking , of course led by @entity17 and @entity257 , mobile computing			0
we 're talking about smart phones and all the applications that go on those smart phones , a lot of expansion there			0
and when you talk about cloud computing , any information or data that you get on your phone or pc that comes from the cloud			0
i had a chance to talk to @entity276			0
he 's a senior writer for @entity278			2
he says this is one of the most exciting periods he 's ever seen here at @entity5			1
@entity282 , senior writer , @entity278 : i think it is on fire if you 're in the right part of the industry			0
so clearly , social networking like @entity17 , @entity248 , the internet cloud , mobile			0
those things are all going like gangbusters			0
if you 're a mobile app developer in @entity5 , you can pretty much write your own ticket			1
@entity294 : economic figures released from the state of @entity21 show that @entity5 added a little more than eight thousand jobs in 2010			1
that trend expected to continue into 2011			0
but the question is is what broader impact will that have , not only here in @entity21 , but across the rest of the @entity57			1
@entity228 , @entity0 , @entity238 , @entity21 ( @entity126 ) @entity304 on @entity305 @entity29 : the state of @entity6 is considering a new law focused specifically on the issue of " sexting			1
" the @entity6 attorney general says the goal of this proposed law is to educate instead of criminalize			1
right now , sexting can lead to some very serious consequences			2
@entity316 explains how and why the state is thinking about making this change			2
( begin video ) @entity320 , @entity0 correspondent : when being social turns into sexting , that 's when many teens could run into problems			1
a new proposed law in @entity6 is aimed at addressing teen sexting , punishing teens who send the texts and their parents			1
@entity331 , @entity6 attorney general : they are exposing themselves ' round the world forever more			1
@entity335 : a new survey shows one in five teens admitted sending or posting suggestive images of themselves			2
nearly four in ten teens admitted sending sexually suggestive messages			2
the proposed law would charge the teen with a misdemeanor , forcing a court appearance , and require parents to enroll in an educational program			1
eventually , offenders could wipe the slate clean at 17 years old			0
@entity349 : our goal is not to put more teens behind bars , but to try to prevent this type of conduct from taking place			2
@entity335 : right now , teens can be charged with possessing or trafficking in child pornography , an offense which carries the potential of decades of prison time and being on the registered sex offender list for life			2
still , the new proposed law is aimed at helping teens think twice before they click and hit send			1
@entity367 : people do n't really care			0
teenagers do n't really care			0
@entity370 : they do n't think about it at all			0
they 're not thinking when they do it			0
@entity335 : in @entity196 , @entity316 for @entity0			0
( @entity126 ) before we go @entity29 : all right , we need to set the scene for you for today 's before we go segment : high school basketball game , third quarter 's winding down			1
and that 's when he grabs a rebound , one of the players just lets it fly			2
it made it ! all the way across the court			0
this was n't half court ; this was full court			0
i do n't think he was even trying to score			0
the buzzer beater still counted			0
and those three points , actually the winning margin in the game			0
this @entity404 video of the last - second shot is getting a lot of hits			0
goodbye @entity29 : which means the shot is generating a lot of buzz - er. we 'll try to rebound from that pun tomorrow			0
and we hope you 'll give us a shot			0
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity26 .			0
