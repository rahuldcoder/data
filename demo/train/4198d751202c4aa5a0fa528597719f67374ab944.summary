-- the parents of a @entity3 toddler are struggling for answers days after their young son mysteriously disappeared from a house full of people			1
@entity8 , the 18 - month - old 's mother , said she believes the boy was abducted -- insisting it would have been all but impossible for her boy to go outside			1
even if he did , @entity8 said , the toddler would have been smart enough to try to get back in or would have been spotted by now			0
but @entity14 lt. @entity13 said as of monday , it 's most likely that young @entity16 left the home without anyone noticing or taking him			1
" the first scenario that we are looking at is that somehow the child was able to exit the house ... and basically disappear into the night , " he told @entity20 's @entity19 on monday			0
@entity8 , also speaking on @entity20 , said she was watching " @entity29 " with @entity16 shortly before 8 p.m. friday when he left the room , heading toward where six other adults and another child were			1
about 10 minutes later , when the boy had n't come back to watch the video or pick up a toy , @entity8 asked the others about his whereabouts			1
but @entity16 was nowhere to be found , neither inside nor outside the house			2
within minutes , family members called police -- who investigated the scene and sent an alert to 2,500 nearby residents			1
one individual came in and out of the house between when @entity8 last saw the toddler and reported him missing , but that person is not considered a suspect			0
@entity13 said police do n't think anyone at the house took the child			2
no @entity48 has been issued for @entity16 because such an alert typically requires solid evidence that an abduction took place			2
" if for some reason somebody came and took that child , not only would ( the people inside ) have seen the child leave the residence , but they would have seen somebody come inside and take him , " @entity13 said			0
still , @entity8 said her toddler could n't have gotten outside himself , noting he was n't tall enough to turn a doorknob			2
" the only way that the baby would have gotten out the door is ( if ) the front door ( was ) open , " she said			0
" but we had the doors closed			0
" ice covered the steps outside , leading @entity8 to believe that there would be signs of @entity73 if he did get out			0
still , as of monday , police searches involving people , helicopters and dogs had n't led to any signs of the boy			1
" they had scent dogs out here , and ( they ) said there was no scent of him leaving the yard , " the toddler 's father , @entity16 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity81			1
" so i do n't see how he could have wandered off , or else they would have picked something up			0

family members and @entity3 police are looking for 18 - month - old @entity16
@entity16 's mother says the boy went to another room and has n't been seen since
she *fears* the toddler was abducted , while police say the boy most likely left *unwittingly*
