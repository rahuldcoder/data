-- @entity1 might be the most educated pastry chef you 'll ever meet			1
@entity1 left her career in medicine at age 38 and became a pastry chef			1
@entity1 attended @entity7 , followed by medical school at @entity9 , then practiced for eight years as an obstetrician / gynecologist before realizing that baking , not medicine , was her calling			1
" everyone would say , ' you 're a doctor ; it must be so great to be able to save lives , ' " she says			0
" but i felt like i was just pushing papers and feeling pressure to see more patients in less time			0
it just was n't fun anymore			0
" so in 2004 , at age 38 , she swapped her stethoscope for a rolling pin and enrolled in the pastry program at @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31			0
" i had always been interested in pastries -- mostly interested in eating them , " she says with a laugh			0
@entity1 now owns @entity35 , a bakery and catering company in @entity37 that specializes in pastries for people with food allergies -- it 's rewarding , she says , to make birthday cakes for people whose dietary sensitivities had forbidden such treats			1
she 's one of thousands of career changers who have left their cubicles for culinary school			1
enrollment has risen 40 percent since 2000 at the @entity51 , and it 's up 15 percent this year at @entity52 , which operates 30 culinary programs across the country			1
the trend is helped by a growing cultural interest in gourmet food and a proliferation of cooking - themed tv shows like the @entity61 's " @entity60 " and @entity63 's " top chef			1
" plenty of possibilities students attending the grueling programs , which can last six to 38 months , can dole out as much as $ 30,000 to $ 40,000 for the diploma			0
and then the real work begins			0
@entity70 , 44 , was technical director at a graphic design firm in 2003 and felt like he no longer fit the mold			0
he quit his 18 - year career and attended the @entity74 in @entity75			1
" i 've always loved to bake , " he says			0
" but baking in a professional kitchen ? i was n't sure that i could handle it			0
" in his first professional experience after pastry school , he found out how tough it can be : " i came very close to tears			1
" yet he persevered , and five years later became head pastry chef at @entity84 's @entity83			1
" you 're not a chef as soon as you finish culinary school , " says @entity85 , author of " the making of a chef , " an inside look at life at the @entity51			1
" you 're a chef only after spending several years further honing your craft and learning the ropes			2
to say otherwise would be like saying grads of medical school could instantly be called pediatric neurosurgeons the day after graduation			2
" and becoming a chef is n't the only option			2
" there are so many possibilities today , " says @entity51 president @entity100			0
" catering , sales , manufacturing -- we even have graduates who have launched clothing companies ( or ) become food scientists			0
" @entity110 , 38 , and @entity111 , 40 , testify to that			0
in 2004 , they quit their jobs at @entity115 and followed their palates to @entity117			2
using the proceeds of their house sale , the couple attended a five - month culinary program in @entity123 , then a nine - month course in @entity125			1
all the while , they had no idea where their gastronomic education would take them			0
" some of our friends and family seemed to think we were a bit insane , " @entity110 recalls			0
but with their newfound culinary know - how , @entity110 and @entity111 launched @entity138 , a boutique public - relations and marketing firm in @entity140 , @entity141 , that focuses on restaurants , hotels and other food - related clients			1
do n't quit your day job just yet think carefully before writing your resignation letter -- culinary school is no cakewalk , says @entity70			1
it 's high - stress			1
it 's a pressure cooker			2
" i ca n't even tell you how many people have read my book and thanked me for saving them from going to culinary school , " he says , " because they had no idea how hard it really is			1
" before taking the plunge , @entity70 and @entity85 suggest getting a feel for the job via a culinary vacation , like those offered through gourmetontour.com and @entity167 , or by shadowing a chef			1
for the second option , " go to a restaurant that you like and respect and ask if you can spend a day in the kitchen , " suggests @entity85			0
it 's called trailing , and some restaurants are open to it			2
if you have some food experience , you might be able to stage ( pronounced stauge ) , which entails working in a kitchen alongside a chef , without pay , for a day or two			2
" you get to see what life is really like in a professional kitchen , " he says , " and it will really open your eyes			0
" looking back , @entity70 says leaving his job for the culinary world was a bold move , but worth every deflated souffl√© along the way : " i 'm much more excited about what i 'm doing now			2
" e-mail to a friend @entity0 provides original and syndicated lifestyle content to web publishers			0
@entity197 's work has appeared in " gourmet , " " health , " " @entity200 , " and many other publications .			2

thousands leave their jobs to attend culinary school
chef : school is " hot . it 's fast . it 's high - stress "
trend is fed by tv shows " @entity60 " and " top chef "
