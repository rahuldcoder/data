-- " we will finish the race			0
" that 's the simple but resilient statement framed by dozens of running shoes forming the shape of a heart on the cover of @entity9 's may cover			1
design director @entity10 and deputy design director @entity11 came up with the idea on april 15 , the night after the @entity13 shook the city -- and nation -- just a few blocks away from the magazine 's offices near @entity19			1
the staff decided to scrap the magazine 's previously planned may cover , and with the new concept in hand utilized social media and personal connections to ask runners who took part in the marathon for their shoes			1
with each pair of shoes came a story , which the staff packaged into a feature called " the shoes we wore			1
" only 15 stories would fit in the print issue ; the rest will live online			0
" every pair became precious , " said editor - in - chief @entity40			2
on thursday , @entity10 packed his car with 120 pairs of colorful sneakers and drove to @entity45 so photographer @entity46 could bring the concept to life			1
" everyone on staff came together to make this happen , " @entity11 told @entity2 's @entity49 and @entity50			2
@entity40 explained on the magazine 's website that the cover is about " perseverance and unity			2
" " by itself , each shoe in the photograph is tiny , battered , and ordinary			0
together , though , they create something beautiful , powerful , and inspirational , " he said			0
" remove just one shoe and you begin to diminish , in some small way , the overall effect			0
collectively , they are the perfect symbol for @entity71 , and for our response to the bombings			0
" each person who donated shoes for the project will get them back , @entity11 said			1
as for the project 's overall message : " it just represents that we 're a strong city , " @entity11 added .			0
