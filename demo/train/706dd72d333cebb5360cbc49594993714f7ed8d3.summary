@entity1 , @entity0 -- the decision of @entity6 giants @entity5 to ban their players from signing autographs at the team 's training ground wo n't affect the sports memorabilia market significantly , an industry expert says			1
sorry kids : @entity5 will no longer be giving autographs at their @entity14 training ground			1
the move to ban autographs was announced by sir @entity16 in the team 's match day program for saturday 's 2 - 1 win over @entity20 at @entity21			2
@entity16 said in the program he wanted to put a stop to memorabilia dealers using the autographs for financial gain			1
" i offer apologies to fans who come to the @entity14 training ground looking for autographs , he wrote			1
" the problem is that we have had too many opportunists selling on signed merchandise			2
they are not fans at all , " @entity16 said			0
while the @entity40 declined to comment on the issue , a spokesman from a @entity38 - based supporters ' club " @entity39 " said he was happy to agree with the manager 's decision			0
" if @entity16 ( sir @entity16 ) likes it then it 's good for us all , " the spokesman told @entity2			0
do you feel autograph - hunters need to be targeted or is this unfair on other fans ? tell us in the @entity51 box below			0
the decision comes at a time when the market for replica jerseys and other autographed football memorabilia continues to grow significantly			1
a quick trawl of the @entity59 's version of auction site @entity61 shows almost 16,000 autographed football items for sale			0
these items include signed jerseys , cards , photos , books and prints			0

vice-president of operations at @entity75 , @entity73 , speaking to @entity2 , estimated the autographed memorabilia industry was worth about $ 4 billion a year			1
" it has definitely been growing , it 's big business			0
in the past , people had n't realized the price they could get for some of these items			0
" the power of the @entity85 has changed this			0
however , with more players signing more autographs , the market is a little flooded with the items , " he said			1
@entity73 said less accessibility to players for some fans should n't alter the market too much as the items sourced from official routes were usually the most popular			2
" people who want a 100 percent genuine item will buy through a company where they can verify the authenticity , " he said			0
a spokeswoman for @entity61 said the trading of football memorabilia was very popular on the site and had grown in recent years			2
more than 90,000 items had been listed in the last three months , and @entity61 had noticed " a shift in people starting to sell their memorabilia on the site to make money , " the spokeswoman told @entity2			2
