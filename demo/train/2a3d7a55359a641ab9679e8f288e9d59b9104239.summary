-- a @entity2 judge on thursday postponed a ruling on whether a former judge 's self - professed racial bias led him to wrongly convict a man of murder nearly 15 years ago			1
the case is being revisited because former @entity10 judge @entity9 , a longtime champion of civil rights , has since said he believes he denied a fair trial to a white man who claimed he killed a black man in self - defense			1
@entity9 now says that in the years after he convicted and sentenced @entity16 , his decision began " haunting " him			1
testifying during a hearing in december on a motion to set aside the conviction , the former judge said he was convinced at the time that the defendant who stood before him was a racist who wanted to kill a black person			1
as a result , @entity9 now says , he ignored evidence that @entity16 had acted out of fear and not hatred			1
@entity2 criminal court judge @entity31 on thursday continued the case until september 22			1
@entity31 , who presided at the december hearing , already had postponed making a ruling in the case twice this year			0
@entity36 said he was armed out of fear in a bench trial in october 1999 , @entity16 said he was acting in self - defense when he shot @entity40 , 23 , during a confrontation at a @entity43 movie theater 11 months before			1
@entity9 , who is white , did n't believe @entity16			2
the judge found him guilty of second - degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon			2
@entity16 was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison , where he remains today			2
@entity9 , now 86 , said in an exclusive interview with @entity0 earlier this year , " i could n't get out of my mind the look on the lawyer 's face when i said i found him guilty			0
and the defendant on the stand , like he was pleading to me , ' it just happened , it just happened , ' and that was sort of haunting me			0
" @entity16 testified during the two - day trial in 1999 that he had been afraid of @entity40 , who was black			1
he said he came to the theater armed because the neighborhood had a reputation of being unsafe			0
@entity40 , according to the trial record , had been confrontational with a number of people that night before the encounter with @entity16			2
when their paths eventually crossed , words were exchanged and they scuffled			0
@entity40 was shot and killed , and @entity16 was charged with murder			1
@entity9 landed the bench trial			0
@entity9 said it may have been his own reputation for fairness that persuaded @entity16 to put his fate in the judge 's hands and not a jury 's			1
@entity9 : ' i think i made a mistake ' in his opinion , @entity9 wrote , " the circumstantial evidence convinces the court that when [ @entity16 ] , in response to [ @entity40 's ] verbal taunts , pulled out his gun for the second and last time , he fully intended to kill [ @entity40 ]			1
'' he said later that he did not give much weight to the self - defense argument presented by @entity16 's attorney			1
@entity9 always had his pulse on the cause of civil rights			0
he stuck up for the underdog in his personal life and professionally , as a lawyer and former state legislator , before becoming a judge			0
was he so influenced by his civil rights passions that he had assumed the only reason @entity16 shot @entity40 was because @entity40 was black ? had he given @entity16 a fair trial ? @entity101 , the judge 's wife , told @entity0 earlier this year , " he said , ' i really feel i need to revisit this case			1
i need to get the transcripts			0
i do n't feel comfortable with this			0
it 's been haunting me			0
' " finally , in 2011 , @entity9 called @entity16 's defense attorney @entity107 and made an amazing admission : " i think i made a mistake , " he told him			1
he asked the attorney to send him the transcript of the trial			0
very unusual motion for reversal after reading his own trial record , @entity9 came to the conclusion that in his quest for equality between the races , he completely ignored the trial evidence that had to do with @entity16 's claim of self - defense			1
he realized he really had n't considered whether @entity16 felt an imminent fear for his life during the confrontation			2
that began the process of a lengthy new legal battle , with the defense filing a motion to set aside @entity9 's murder verdict based on one of the most unusual claims the courts would ever hear : the trial judge was admitting he had not given the defendant a fair trial			1
the judge -- who by then had retired and no longer had jurisdiction in the case -- became , in effect , a witness for the defense of the man he had convicted years earlier			2
@entity146 ex-prosecutor denies wrongdoing in @entity150 death penalty case @entity40 's family : ' it 's not fair ' @entity9 testified at the december 2013 hearing and was cross-examined by the prosecution , who questioned the judge 's memory of events in an effort to discount his admission of racial bias			1
the family of @entity163 , including his now - grown son , attended that hearing , too			2
they were angry that the justice they felt they received with the verdict so many years ago could possibly be taken away			0
one month later , @entity40 's family returned to court to hear arguments on the issue by both sides			0
in an impassioned plea , the prosecution told the court the conviction should stand , that 14 years ago judge @entity9 thoughtfully issued a very well - reasoned opinion			2
they said even if his personal beliefs colored his perception of the case , that was not grounds to overturn the verdict			2
" it 's not fair , " said @entity188 , who was @entity40 's girlfriend and the mother of his child			1
" my son grew up without a father , it 's not fair			0
[ @entity16 ] pulled out the gun and he murdered that man			0
" @entity40 's family told @entity0			0
after testifying last year , @entity9 said , " it was n't difficult to come forward			0
it is painful to know i sent an innocent man to jail			0
" @entity16 , now 39 , becomes eligible for parole in november			0
