-- @entity1 , the " happiest baby in the world , " according to his mother , is blissfully unaware that a judge ruled that his birth name promises to offend many in his @entity9 community			1
his mother , @entity11 , and father , @entity13 , who are not married , could n't agree on a last name for their baby , now 7 months old			1
that 's why they ended up in the courtroom of @entity21 magistrate @entity20			1
@entity20 ruled last week that not only should little @entity23 's last name be changed -- from @entity24 to @entity13 -- but also that his first name should be changed			1
in her ruling , @entity20 wrote : " ' @entity27 ' is a title that is held only by @entity28 " and that naming him this " places an undue burden on him that as a human being , he can not fulfill			1
" her ruling also noted the large @entity35 population in the @entity36 where the child was born			0
speaking to @entity0 affiliate @entity38 , @entity20 , wearing earrings in the shape of a cross , said this was the first time she had ordered a name change			0
@entity24 , whose family is @entity46 , said there was no religious motivation behind her pick ; rather she 'd heard the name on one of her favorite tv shows and thought it 'd be a good name for her son			0
she also wanted another " m " name to go with her other two sons , @entity57 and @entity58			0
@entity0 could not reach @entity13 for comment			0
heartbroken and shocked , @entity24 told @entity60 gave the parents a one - hour recess to pick a new name and then issued the new name when she and the baby 's father could n't come up with one			2
the judge 's pick : @entity24 @entity70			1
@entity24 said that she 'll keep calling her son @entity23 and that she has heard from supporters all over the country			2
she 's also upset about reports she is being attacked online as a bad mother			2
the @entity77 is following the case , saying it supports @entity24 and calling the judge 's ruling unacceptable			1
" the bench is not a pulpit , and using it as one , as this judge did , violates the parents ' rights and our sense that people of all faiths will be treated fairly in the courtroom , " executive director @entity81 said			2
according to @entity95 @entity94 statistics , @entity23 was the fourth - fastest growing name for boys in the @entity95 from 2011 to 2012			0
it ranks at @entity99 , between the decidedly traditional names @entity101 and @entity102			0
@entity20 declined @entity0 's request for comment			0
@entity24 has appealed the court 's decision ; it will go before the @entity108 chancellor next month .			1

@entity23 's parents could not agree on his last name , so they ended up in court
the judge *objected* to his first name , saying it is " a title that is held only by @entity28 "
the stunned mother has appealed the @entity9 judge 's ruling
