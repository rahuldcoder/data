-- a @entity4 woman missing for nearly a year and believed to be dead may still be alive and living in the @entity7 , @entity8 , area , detectives from @entity2 said thursday			1
investigators have spent about six weeks checking out a high - school classmate 's report that he saw @entity14 at a hotel casino , and are " unable to show that it is not a good lead , " @entity2 police capt. @entity9 said			1
and detectives have talked to several witnesses since then who believe seen her in the area , he said			0
" it is not a verified sighting of her here , but we feel good enough to come up here and spend a good deal of time to get the information out to the community that we believe she might be here , " @entity21 told reporters at a news conference in @entity7			1
but @entity14 's mother , who is suing the @entity36 over her daughter 's disappearance , cast doubt on the report			1
@entity41 told @entity46 's " issues with @entity47 " that the man who reported the sighting has n't seen her daughter for a decade			2
@entity14 , who would be 25 now , is a former beauty pageant contestant who was last seen leaving a @entity36 's station in @entity49 in the early morning hours of september 17 , 2009			1
she had been arrested the previous evening at an upscale restaurant for allegedly not paying for her meal , and patrons at the restaurant said @entity14 exhibited strange behavior			2
her family has said the college honors graduate suffered from mental health issues and should have been kept at the sheriff 's station until a relative arrived to pick her up			2
investigators are now asking the public in and around @entity7 to report any possible sightings , and urged @entity14 herself to come forward			1
" she 's not in any type of trouble , " said capt. @entity64 , of the @entity36			0
" she 's not subject to any type of arrest we would like her to approach her family , approach us , and please let us know that she 's ok			0
" a high - school classmate now living in @entity7 reported seeing @entity14 at the @entity71 in early june , sparking the new effort by detectives to check out his report			1
" he walked up and said , ' hi , @entity75 , " @entity64 said			0
" she basically looked at him with kind of a shocked look and left the location			0
" the casino 's security cameras did n't have video of the incident that was of a high enough quality			1
but since then , investigators have talked to more than 70 people who say they have seen her , said @entity87 , chief of the @entity89 detective division			0
those accounts were " based on a photograph and some passage of time , in most instances , " @entity87 said			0
" but that volume causes us to beleive we 're on the right track			0
" but @entity41 told @entity46 on thursday , " i do not believe it was her			0
" she said hundreds of similar reports in @entity2 have failed to pan out , while the man who reported seeing her in the casino had n't seen her daughter since high school			1
and she questioned why police considered that report believable after dismissing an earlier report by @entity108 , the missing woman 's father , that he had spotted his daughter in @entity7			1
" someone who has n't seen @entity14 in 10 years , they consider him now more credible than the biological father ? @entity41 asked			2
" i do not believe this is @entity14			2
@entity14 was last seen at the sheriff 's department			1
" last month , @entity41 sued @entity89 and several sheriff 's officials for wrongful death and negligence in her daughter 's disappearance , according to court documents			0
@entity41 argued that the sheriff 's department failure to administer psychiatric or medical evaluations and the fact that @entity14 was released " alone in an unfamiliar area without money , a cellular phone or means of transportation amounts to negligence			1
" the lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages			0
@entity136 , a spokesman for the sheriff 's department , told @entity0 in september that the decision to release @entity14 was made because " she was not intoxicated , she did n't exhibit any mental issues , so when we were done running her fingerprints and criminal history , then we are obligated by law to release her from custody			1
" he also has said that a female jailer " offered to her to stay the night			0
she could have stayed , but she wanted to leave			0
" police have not discounted the possibility that @entity14 may not want to be found , but her family believes that would be " out of her character " @entity21 said			2
" we could find that out , but we 'll never know that until we actually talk to @entity14 , " he said			2
@entity0 's @entity155 contributed to this report .			0
