-- @entity1 may just have found another paralympian to inspire a nation -- and perhaps the world			1
after " @entity11 " @entity11 became the first double - amputee runner to compete at an @entity13 , and @entity14 excelled in the pool , @entity6 -- who lost both his legs and most of his right arm when he fell under a train aged 12 -- became the first @entity1 to win a title at tennis ' @entity16			1
" @entity14 made a huge impact on @entity1 sport , the same as @entity11 , " the nation 's @entity19 captain , @entity18 , told @entity0			1
" @entity6 can play the same role			2
" judging by the welcome he received in @entity25 following his historic victory in @entity27 in september , @entity6 is well on his way			1
a large crowd greeted @entity6 at @entity30 , where he signed posters that read , " @entity32			2
" reflecting on the scene , @entity6 was still genuinely surprised			2
and why would n't he be ? such receptions for wheelchair tennis champions are highly unusual			0
" i was n't expecting it but at the end of the day i was happy to be honored like that , " the 27 - year - old told @entity0			1
" people were calling my name and it was nice to get recognized even if i 'm only in wheelchair tennis			0
it was actually awesome , man			0
" later on , even when i went from my house to the shop to buy bread , people still recognized me			0
i have no problem with that			0
" boost for @entity1 tennis his emergence as a tennis ace comes at a good time for @entity1 , since the country 's no. 1 in the @entity59 ranks , @entity56 , has n't played in the @entity19 for two years			1
@entity56 is married to an @entity61 and last year in an interview with the @entity63 did n't rule out representing the @entity61 in the future			0
@entity65 , a former no. 1 in women 's doubles , already changed her nationality , becoming an @entity61 citizen six years ago			1
she has since won three @entity16 doubles titles			2
and some will say @entity6 can take over from @entity11 in capturing the hearts of @entity1 after the latter 's fall from grace			1
there is no doubting that @entity11 ' exploits on the track led to plaudits and a massive following -- without the use of half his legs he reached the semifinals at @entity83 competing against able - bodied athletes -- but his reputation has suffered since he was accused of murdering his model girlfriend , @entity86			2
" @entity6 is fortunate that people in @entity1 have already recognized athletes with a disability probably stronger than other countries , " says @entity6 's coach , @entity87			1
@entity1 's president , @entity92 , sent @entity6 a message of congratulations for his achievement at @entity96 when he downed @entity97 on the latter 's home soil			1
" it was no small feat , " @entity92 said in a statement			0
" he has made both the government and the people of @entity1 immensely proud			0
" even if the attendance on @entity106 could n't match the buzz for the men 's final between @entity110 and @entity111 on gargantuan @entity112 , the atmosphere was nonetheless raucous			1
shouts of " @entity61 , @entity61 " were meant to encourage @entity97 but @entity6 rallied from a set down to beat the world no. 1 in three sets , shedding tears of joy when the finale concluded			1
a left - hander like @entity110 , @entity6 also hits with heavy spin on his forehand			2
prior to his accident -- @entity6 said he preferred " not to go back there " when the incident was brought up in this interview -- he had n't seen anyone play tennis			2
he picked up his first racquet only about seven years ago			0
" certainly i thought that @entity6 could be a force in the future but i just did n't know how long it would take him , " @entity97 , who plays with his racquet taped to his right hand , told @entity0			1
" he 's very quick around the court and has good chair skills and some big shots			0
" @entity6 and @entity97 -- who are occasional doubles partners -- developed a rivalry in 2013 , meeting nine times in singles since the end of may , and more battles are expected next year given they are the top two in the quads rankings			1
thinking further ahead , @entity6 aims to be on the podium at the 2016 paralympics in @entity148			0
@entity97 beat a then unseeded @entity6 in the first round of the @entity147 in @entity150 a year ago			1
' double bagel ' start @entity6 contested his first international wheelchair event in 2006 in the @entity154 , home to the most dominant wheelchair player of all time , @entity156			0
@entity97 beat him in doubles and @entity6 lost his opening singles match by the dreaded " double bagel " score of 6 - 0 6 - 0			1
" he 's done exceptionally well to get to where he is now in a short time , " said @entity87			0
" his character is the thing that drives him the hardest and he relishes playing on the big stage			0
" if you look at @entity6 physically you 'd think of all kinds of reasons he 'd struggle to do stuff but when you get to know him , you see that he takes on challenges			0
he lives his life to the fullest			0
" attending a primary and secondary school for the physically disabled changed @entity6 's mindset for the better as he saw fellow students thriving			2
and that has come full circle , as pupils from one of his former schools were among those who saluted him at the airport			0
amassing more grand slam titles will only strengthen @entity6 's profile , said @entity18 , who rose to no. 11 in the world in doubles after overcoming a heart condition at birth			1
" i think it 's going to be key for him now to keep improving and try and win some more big tournaments , " he said			0
" i think if that happens it would be huge for tennis in @entity1 , especially wheelchair tennis			2
