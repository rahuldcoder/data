-- payday lenders are n't the most scrupulous of operations			1
preying on the desperation of people who do n't have enough money to make it to their next payday , these lenders dole out short - term loans with exorbitant interest rates , forcing already cash - strapped customers deeper into debt			1
and while many have tried to reform the payday lending industry , we 're still awaiting the right answer			1
@entity17 has a new approach			0
he wants to solve the problem at its root , by eradicating the payday altogether			2
according to @entity17 , the real culprit here is the very concept of the payday			2
the way he sees it , there 's no reason people who already have done their work should have to wait several days , or even weeks , to get the money they 've rightfully earned			1
so , in may , @entity17 launched @entity33			1
the @entity35 startup , which recently raised $ 4.1 million , makes an app that allows hourly workers to immediately access pay they 've already earned , without having to wait for their employer 's standard pay cycle			1
what 's more , there are no fees			2
instead , @entity33 makes money on tips , asking users to pay what they want			1
" we 're trying to build something that 's completely aligned with the consumer , unlike what people are used to today in typical financial services , where it 's , in some ways , adversarial , " he says			0
@entity17 is far from the only entrepreneur who sees opportunity in creating an alternative to the payday loan			2
@entity62 , for instance , has raised $ 64 million to offer loans with lower interest rates that become cheaper over time			2
@entity65 , launched by an @entity66 , is similar			0
but even these players still rely on fees , both for profit and protection			2
in this demographic , after all , there tends to be a high rate of delinquency , so even the most upstanding lenders typically account for those losses upfront			0
but with its no - fee model , @entity33 is a radical departure			1
the company is betting that when given the choice , its customers -- already struggling financially -- will still pay for the service it provides			1
" some people look at the model and think we 're crazy , " @entity17 says , " but we tested it and found the model is sufficient to building a sustainable business			0
" unlocking the money you 've already earned this is not @entity17 's first financial services company			1
in 2004 , he launched @entity94 , a startup that allowed people without access to a traditional bank account to get their paychecks loaded onto a prepaid atm card			2
the goal was to offer the so - called " under - banked " an alternative to going to @entity103 or other check cashing businesses , which take a large cut of every transaction			0
while @entity17 was working at @entity94 , though , he learned that an employee working in the call center had recently taken a payday loan			2
he immediately wrote her a personal check and told her to pay it off as soon as possible			2
" i did n't want anyone who worked for me to have to use payday loans , " he says			2
that 's when he realized that there should be an easier way for employees to unlock the money they 'd already earned			2
when he left @entity94 in 2012 after selling it to a private equity firm , he began experimenting with ways to automate such a service			2
it 's a complex process that requires verifying who an employee is , where he works , how much he 's worked , and what his hourly wage is			2
then there 's the equally difficult process of integrating with banks to deposit and withdraw funds from each user 's existing bank account			0
@entity17 and several of his @entity94 team members spent about a year developing the technology and launched the app publicly in may			0
back then , @entity33 was handling transactions for employees from 100 different employers			1
today , it 's 250 employers , including the likes of @entity144 , @entity145 , and even major banks like @entity147 and @entity148			0
how it works employees can sign up for @entity150 on their own , providing their bank account number			0
they use the app to upload a photo of their electronic time sheets ( paper time sheets are n't allowed )			0
@entity33 knows which systems are used by most employers , so it uses a photo of the system to verify the timesheet is real and checks the hours logged against past deposits made into the user 's bank account			1
@entity33 also uses geolocation to ensure the user was at work when he took the photo			1
once a user has been approved , he can see how much money he 's already earned and transfer any percentage of it into his bank account			0
@entity33 essentially gives the user a cash advance and deposits it into the user 's account the next day			1
when payday rolls around , @entity33 withdraws the same amount from the user 's account			1
and at the end of it all , users can opt to pay @entity33 a couple bucks -- or nothing at all			1
unusual as that may sound , @entity17 is n't the only one who believes in the concept			0
@entity33 has caught the attention of @entity191 , a financial services investment firm that typically only invests in late stage companies			1
according to @entity195 , founder of @entity191 , what @entity17 and his crew are building is so special , though , the firm was compelled to join @entity33 ' seed round			1
" it 's a very powerful concept , " @entity198 says			0
" as we move into this on - demand economy , your payroll should be the same way			0
" the threat of abuse still , not everyone is as convinced			0
according to @entity208 , assistant professor of finance at @entity211 's @entity210 , @entity33 is a smart idea that 's meeting a very real need for low cost alternatives to payday loans			1
and yet , she says , @entity33 may be overly vulnerable to abuse			1
although people are only borrowing money they 've already earned , @entity208 says it 's still possible that when @entity33 tries to withdraw money from a user 's account on payday , the money will already be gone			1
then , there 's the fact that @entity33 relies on donations , meaning it 's susceptible to what economists call the free rider problem			1
" people assume someone else is better able to step up and contribute , " she says			0
" this whole idea of donations sounds great , but we 're talking about people who are constrained			0
they do n't have savings			0
" and , if the donation model does n't work , @entity208 points out , @entity33 reserves the right to change its fee structure at any point			1
but @entity17 says that , so far , such abuses have not been a major issue			0
the bigger problem , he says , is convincing people @entity33 is n't just another payday lender tricking people into a cycle of debt			1
" people are n't used to the model , so they think it 's too good to be true , " he says			0
" they 're judging us with a standard that 's completely terrible			0
what we 're doing is not too good to be true			0
it 's what we 've been living with that 's too bad to be allowed			0
