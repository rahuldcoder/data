@entity2 's hottest destination for tourists , @entity0 offers more than bargain - priced nightclubs and @entity6 nostalgia			1
some of the most interesting sights in @entity8 are just a few hours away -- and with the deregulation of the intercity bus system , getting around is cheaper than ever			1
here 's a shortlist of three great day trips from @entity0			1
@entity13 the site of the famous " @entity15 " that negotiated the end of @entity17 and a series of opulent @entity20 palaces , @entity13 lies only about an hour from the center of @entity0 , with all the major attractions easily reachable by public transport			1
it 's a day trip not because of the travel time , but because there 's so much to see			1
highlights include the breathtaking @entity28 ( @entity29 , @entity13 ; +49 331 9694200 ) , the former summer residence of @entity30 -- who ruled the @entity32 from 1740 to 1786			2
a pale and beautiful @entity36 villa , its name means " without a care " and reflects the idyllic atmosphere of tranquil reflection @entity30 sought to create with a grand , terraced vineyard to the south and sweeping views of the surrounding countryside			2
an audio tour covers the palace interior , where most of the original furnishings remain just as the @entity32 king preferred them , and on a fine day the huge gardens are perfect for an impromptu picnic			2
hardcore palace fans may have enough energy for a gander at the @entity54 and the @entity55 , or " toy fortress " -- a miniature fort , complete with a working cannon , built for @entity30 's son			2
but in our opinion it makes a better write - up than it does a visit , and it 's better to take the audio tour of the @entity67 ( @entity68 11 , @entity13 ; +49 331 9694 200 ) this mammoth , @entity70 - style mansion is where @entity73 president @entity72 , @entity75 prime minister @entity74 and @entity77 leader @entity76 negotiated the partition of post-war @entity8 in 1945			1
( as always in @entity82 museums , it 's advisable to spring for the headphones unless you 're a history professor )			1
depending on where else you 're headed , the @entity85 of @entity13 itself can be underwhelming -- cluttered as it is with garden - variety shopping			2
the varied architecture of the @entity90 and @entity92 quarters -- built in @entity8 's first , misguided effort to attract " desirable " immigrants in the 18th century -- is , however , worth strolling through			1
getting there pay an extra 2 euros over the standard charge for the @entity97 and get free travel and discounts for various attractions in @entity13 ( not the biggies )			2
otherwise , day passes for the @entity103 zones of the @entity0 transit system -- which covers buses and trains within @entity13 , as well as the so - called " regional train " -- are available for 7.20 euros			2
@entity108 in the wake of the recent 25th anniversary of the fall of the @entity112 , the nearby cultural capital of @entity108 -- which was the real nerve center of the peaceful @entity114 , as well as the longtime home of @entity117 composer @entity116 -- makes an especially compelling day trip			1
it 's two hours by bus or 70 minutes by train from @entity0			2
though it was virtually destroyed by @entity125 bombs in @entity17 , the reconstruction of @entity108 's old town is so seamless that it 's difficult to recognize the @entity128 churches and old market square as reproductions			0
meanwhile , a growing community of artists and hipsters have created a mushrooming bar , dance club and arts scene that has some people calling it " the new @entity0 " ( or , more disparagingly , " @entity139 " )			0
for a tribute to the movement that brought down the @entity147 , visit the @entity148 ( nikolaikirchhof 3 , @entity108 ; +49 341 1245380 ) , the church where a small , @entity82 prayer group known as " swords into @entity142 " grew into a protest involving thousands of people			1
founded in 1165 , the church is a mash - up of @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity117 architectural styles , but its moment in history gives it an atmosphere that ca n't be beat			0
you can get a glimpse of @entity161 at the @entity162 ( @entity163 7 , @entity108 ; +49 341 4980200 ; guided tours by appointment ) -- a 19th century cotton mill that was converted into an artists ' collective in the 1990s			0
put on the map by the so - called " @entity170 " -- which includes the post-reunification works of @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 and others -- the complex now comprises artist studios , workshops and galleries			0
for classical music fans , the @entity180 -- or " @entity181 " -- links prominent sites from the city 's musical history along a 5 - kilometer ( 3 - mile ) walking route			0
it includes the homes of the renowned 19th century composers @entity190 and @entity191 as well as museums devoted to @entity116 and @entity193			0
regardless of your take on literature -- or deals with the devil -- it 's worth enjoying a meal at the @entity200 ( @entity201 2 - 4 , @entity108 ; +49 341 216100 )			0
one of @entity8 's oldest restaurants , it 's where 18th century poet @entity204 , a frequent patron , imagined @entity206 downing a few with his eponymous hero , @entity208			1
getting there : tickets on the high - speed train to @entity108 can currently be had as cheap as 29 euros ( around $ 40 ) from @entity212			0
luxury coaches with snacks , toilets and @entity216 can get you there almost as quickly , starting at just 7 euros			0
try @entity219 ( +49 180 5 15 99 15 ) or @entity220 ( +49 30 338 448 0 )			0
@entity221 @entity222 little @entity221 , about three hours from @entity0 if you time the connections right , is a bit more off the beaten track			1
but the number of @entity229 productions shot here -- " @entity231 , " " @entity232 " and " @entity233 , " among others -- testify to its status as perhaps the most picturesque prewar @entity82 town , even if it does n't make many guidebooks			1
in many respects , it 's a place to witness @entity8 's @entity241 -- despite thriving larger cities like @entity108 , many areas are struggling to make a comeback			1
there 's not a lot in the way of tourist infrastructure , so it 's best visited when the weather is good			0
it 's the kind of place where the renovation team at the famous @entity252 ( @entity253 21 , @entity221 ) -- once an icon in the style of @entity256 's @entity255 or @entity258 's @entity257 -- and more recently the setting for @entity260 's " @entity232 " -- will drop what they 're doing to give guided tours			1
in nice weather , there are walks along the @entity267 and across the bridge into @entity269 -- still fun even if the days of passport stamps are long gone			0
for some traditional @entity273 food , such as pork cooked in plum gravy , the town has several fine sidewalk restaurants			0
other highlights include a series of late @entity154 merchant houses , some of which still have interior fittings dating back to the 1500s , a stunning @entity284 , or town hall , built in 1526 , as well as a street where local glassblowers still ply their trade			0
the real joy of the place , though , is the feeling of discovery from exploring the streets -- which really do look like , well , a film set			1
getting there : from @entity0 , regional trains run from @entity297 more or less hourly for around 40 euros ( about $ 60 )			0
but consult the schedule to avoid a wait when transferring in @entity300 .			0

@entity221 was the film set for " @entity231 , " " @entity232 " and " @entity233 "
president @entity72 , prime minister @entity74 and @entity77 leader @entity76 negotiated the partition of post-war @entity8 at @entity67
@entity148 was the *birthplace* of the @entity82 movement that instigated the collapse of the @entity112
