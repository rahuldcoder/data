@entity0 , @entity1 -- hip - hop artists do n't often smile , so it was no surprise that @entity1 rapper @entity5 scowled suspiciously when i first walked into his cramped , cigarette smoke - filled studio in a former government building in @entity0			1
this is where @entity5 , 23 , has been writing scathing lyrics about the @entity14 regime ever since @entity1 's uprising began in february			1
@entity1 musicians and artists probably have a right to be wary of strangers			1
for decades , they say , they feared agents and paid informants of @entity14 's repressive regime who reported to the government any work they deemed hostile to the state			0
when asked what would happen if he rapped his anti-regime lyrics prior to @entity1 's uprising , @entity5 said , " i would be shot to death like @entity32 , " referring to the @entity30 rapper killed in 1996			1
but here in @entity0 , the opposition 's de facto capital , there 's no sign of @entity14 's loyalists anymore -- or the fear that kept artists like @entity41 quiet for so long			2
a newfound freedom of expression has sparked an explosion in revolutionary music and art. much of it takes place in a five - story building -- a government building turned cultural center -- that is steps away from the @entity54			1
the building 's hallways are covered with art and anti-regime cartoons , and the rooms are often buzzing through the wee hours of the morning with dozens of young revolutionary artists at work			2
" tomorrow we will take over our land , " @entity62 raps in his second - floor studio , his dj and machine gun - toting friend by his side			0
" @entity14 , we 're coming with a mass revolution			0
" a few doors down , 26 - year - old @entity71 sketches a giant caricature of @entity14			0
on the third floor , the rock band @entity74 practices its latest song dedicated to the revolution			0
" when you get in this building , you 're going to find yourself in another world , " said @entity78 , the lead singer for @entity74			0
" it 's like being @entity83			0
it 's an amazing feeling i 've never had in my life			1
" " it feels like we 're touching freedom , " said @entity5 , who often sleeps overnight in his studio			2
the revolution 's young artists say they represent the real @entity1 , and they bristle at allegations that @entity1 's rebels include elements of @entity96 and @entity98 extremists			1
" you can find men with beards , but they 're respectful @entity102 , " @entity5 said			0
" they 're not terrorists			2
you can see they have weapons , but they 're fighting for our freedom			1
" @entity112 said , " we were buried for 42 years , but this is the true @entity1			0

a newfound freedom of speech has been embraced by @entity1 musicians and artists
one @entity1 rocker : " it 's an amazing feeling i 've never had in my life "
the artists say the @entity1 rebels have weapons , but they 're not terrorists
