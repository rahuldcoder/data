-- " nice guys finish last " is a mantra often preached in sport and business			2
where golf is concerned , it would seem " nice guys " finish second			2
and they even manage to smile			2
@entity10 and @entity11 both won plenty of admirers for their sportsmanship and grace during two of the sport 's blue riband major tournaments this year			1
the only drawback was , all that praise came after agonizing defeats			2
for @entity10 , an @entity24 ranked sixth in the men 's game who has long been tipped for major success , july 's @entity23 tested his ability to swallow the bitter pills so often served up on golf 's greens and fairways			1
he held a four - shot lead going into the final round , but bogeyed the last four holes and handed the title to veteran @entity39 @entity38			1
his capitulation followed in the tradition of his compatriot @entity42 , one of the greatest golfers of the 1980s and early ' 90s -- but a player who famously " choked " on several big occasions			2
" i think the emotions shown in golf are different to other sports , " the 32 - year - old @entity10 told @entity0 when asked about how he was able to remain dignified in the face of abject disappointment at @entity48 and @entity49			1
he congratulated @entity38 with a brave if rueful smile and carried out his duties to face the seemingly endless stream of media requests			2
" it has always been referred to as a gentleman 's game , but i think it has got more to do with how you 're brought up and your influences , " @entity10 said			1
" i certainly feel like my parents have brought me up well , but also i had good role models that i looked up to as a kid			2
" certainly @entity42 , i saw him win hundreds of tournaments and lose some big ones , but i think he handled himself well in those situations too , so like you do when you 're a kid you always try to mimic those you look up to			2
" @entity42 won his first major in 1986 , a decade after turning professional			1
however , that year he led all four majors going into the final round , but came away with just a @entity23 victory -- his first of two @entity75			1
the " @entity78 " was runner - up at no less than seven major tournaments			1
@entity10 , who tied for second at last year 's masters , collapsed over his putter at @entity48 after blowing his biggest chance yet of a breakthrough win			1
" i think i was a little numb from shock that i might have lost , " he explained			2
" i felt like i played like a winner the whole week and even with a couple of mistakes coming in it did n't feel horrendous out on the course			2
" there is only one shot i was really , really disappointed with and that was the shot into the 17th green			0
i was n't really in that much trouble on the last few holes other than the 17th where i was in the long grass			0
" that ends up putting me in quite an awkward position to close the tournament			0
that is probably the one shot i would like to take over again			0
but other than that i do n't think i would do anything different			0
" @entity11 , known as " @entity104 , " is one of a troop of promising female golfing talents emerging from @entity107			1
the @entity108 looked set to announce her arrival on the world stage when she was stood over a one - foot putt at the 18th to win her first major at the @entity113 in april			1
the ball rolled around the lip of the cup but refused to sink , coming to a stop outside of the hole			0
somehow @entity11 had missed and , in a cruel coincidence , she was forced into a playoff with compatriot @entity122 which she duly lost			1
" i was disappointed right after it happened , " the 24 - year - old told @entity0			1
" i get this question a lot ... i am competitive , but from my point of view you ca n't really attach your emotion to a result			0
it is something you ca n't control			0
" separating her emotions from her golf is something @entity11 has worked on throughout her career , using a mental coach to help her hone her craft			1
" all we can control is the process and how hard we work , which we do every day , " the world no. 18 explained			0
" i feel like i worked really hard through that tournament and i stayed with my process and everything was good			0
" these techniques involve learning to appreciate the good and the bad			0
" to smile more often , to enjoy , " @entity11 said			1
" i sometimes forget what i can control and what i ca n't -- they remind me			0
" @entity11 's ability to perform in golf 's most pressurized situations has been called into question			1
the playoff at the @entity113 was the third of her career , and her third defeat			1
" i 've always been really bummed out after the 18th hole and gone into the playoff without preparing , " @entity11 said			1
" that is something i have been working on , to control emotion after whatever happened			0
" after you have finished it is tough to go and do a playoff , there is nothing you can think about before			0
that is something i have to work on			0
" it has been two and a half years since @entity11 last won an event , the @entity172 in november 2010			1
@entity11 picked up a cool $ 220,000 for winning the tournament in @entity174 , and she chose to donate all of it to charity			1
" i like competition , but it is just a different feeling helping someone , " said @entity11 , who has earned more than $ 5 million since turning pro in 2007			1
" i feel like i can help by playing golf			0
" without a lot of good people around me i would n't be able to do it , so i 'm fortunate and i wanted to share the win			0
i always dreamed about helping other people and i had an opportunity			0
" like @entity11 , @entity10 is also without a win in 2012			1
the @entity191 native still has the chance to address that -- this week he lines up at the $ 7 million @entity196 event in @entity197 , then goes to @entity198 before returning home for two of @entity24 's biggest tournaments			0
" playing at home is a big deal for me , i certainly want to perform , " said @entity10 , who has earned more than $ 28 million on the @entity203 @entity202			1
" i 'm also quite motivated because i feel like i 've played a lot of good golf this year to not have a win and i 'd really like to finish the year off by winning one , or two or more of these tournaments			2
" i still view ( the @entity23 ) as the highlight of my year			1
to play so well , that 's what i 've been trying so long to do in majors , and finally it has happened			0
" i did n't come out as a champion , but if i can repeat that kind of preparation and play then i 'm sure if give myself another chance i 'm going to win a major or two			2
" @entity11 has won three times on the @entity221 , and once on the @entity223 ' circuit , but is cautious about her chances of ending her title drought			1
" @entity228 is a mystery , " she said ahead of this week 's @entity226 in @entity227			0
" nobody knows how to play this game perfectly and i do n't think anyone has ever done it			0
you play four rounds every week and it is very hard to keep that momentum going			0
" you have to do a lot of work , it might come out this weekend , you never know			0
i 'll do my best , there are things i need to improve but there are things i 'm doing well			0
" you want to win , but it 's difficult , being reminded it has been two years since you won ! it 's not easy , but for me i work really hard			0
i 'm very happy with everything , so hopefully i can win more tournaments by the end of this year			2
