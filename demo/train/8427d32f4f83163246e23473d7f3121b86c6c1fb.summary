-- an 11 - year - old from @entity2 said he is going to really wow his schoolmates friday with the " coolest " show - and - tell item anyone 's ever brought to the sixth grade			1
after all , it 's not every day you get to show off a 13,000 - year - old mastodon bone you and your cousin found in a stream behind your backyard			1
" i thought it was a rock at first , but a couple minutes later i looked more at it , and i did n't think it was a dinosaur bone , but i was n't sure , " @entity13 of @entity2 told @entity0 on thursday			1
he and @entity16 , 11 , from @entity17 , @entity2 , were hunting for crayfish in the stream that extends from the middle branch of the @entity20 , as they often did , when they " got bored " and decided to build a dam			1
they made an extraordinary discovery that june day			1
@entity26 , a geologist and paleontologist at the @entity28 confirmed in early november that what the " kids just being kids outside " discovered was not a rock at all , but an axis , a specialized second vertebrae behind the skull in the spinal column of an @entity38 mastodon			1
" these animals have been extinct for 10,000 years , " @entity26 told @entity0			2
he works extensively on subjects in this time period , and noticed the distinct bone from the prehistoric elephant - like mammal right away			1
" oh my gosh , we were like psyched , " @entity13 said of learning it was a real mastodon bone			1
" i was like i think we are the first people in @entity2 to find a bone ( who ) are only 11 years old			1
" the mastodon , which is @entity50 's state fossil , is common to the geographic landscape , according to @entity26			1
he said more than 200 discoveries have been made in the southern half of @entity50 over the past 150 years , usually by farmers or construction crews			2
the large mammals became extinct because of nomadic hunters causing new stress for the population and a very abrupt climate change , dubbed the " @entity63 " period , when temperatures reversed to glacial conditions			0
" there are just incredible stories beneath us , about how @entity69 changed in the past , " @entity26 said			0
" every once in a while -- by construction workers , or exploring 11 - year - old boys and girls -- something like this comes to the forefront and reminds us of the incredible history of @entity69 's landscape			0
" @entity79 , @entity13 's mother , said when the boys stumbled in the house with the discovery her first thought was " oh my goodness , what did they bring home ? " she told @entity0 she thought it was a cow 's bone			2
" it 's been sitting on dining room shelf since last june , " @entity13 said			0
she reached out to the paleontologist in november			0
" @entity26 , dr. @entity26 the scientist as my son calls him , was over my house within an hour after me e-mailing him to say ' you wo n't believe what you discovered ' " the mother explained			0
when they first discovered the mass with a large hole in it , @entity16 told @entity0 , " i said it 's obviously a dinosaur bone , but my cousin said ' no. ' " " i told @entity13 , you really want to go there ? i bet 100 bucks it is a dinosaur bone , because i have always been fascinated with bones , " @entity16 continued			2
the bet has n't been settled because the boys have since learned it 's not a dinosaur bone , but that of an extinct mammoth			1
@entity16 said this experience has him thinking about maybe becoming a paleontologist , but he is still considering being a lawyer " and other things too			0
" @entity13 said he is a bit nervous about his presentation friday			2
" i am bringing the bone tomorrow , and i am going to make a poster and explain to every science class in sixth grade what a mastodon is , " he told @entity0			1
" i feel really special			0
people said it 's just amazing how i found this			0
" the boys are mulling over what they are going to do with the fossil			0
" @entity16 said maybe we can sell it , and that we could be famous ... but i guess we are famous already , " @entity13 said			0
" we are still in the thinking process of putting it on @entity135 or giving it to the museum , " @entity16 clarified thursday			0
" i have been thinking of selling it and making money off it , " @entity16 continued , " but who is going to pay 2,000 bucks for a bone ? " read more : scientist describes fruit - loving , housecat - sized dino			2
