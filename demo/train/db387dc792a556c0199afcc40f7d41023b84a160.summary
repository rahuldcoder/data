@entity2 the day before @entity1 came out as the original voice of @entity5 in the @entity6 , she lost her @entity7			1
but that 's just one smile - inducing twist in a less - than - two - week journey that 's left this suburban @entity2 voiceover actor " gobsmacked " and feeling like " some strange tropical bird " on display , she said			2
" i had no idea this would be such a big deal			2
" on october 4 , exactly two years after @entity22 's virtual " assistant " was introduced to the masses with the release of the @entity20 , @entity3 revealed her identity			1
hours after our in - depth story was published online , she was sitting on the @entity27 set of @entity3 's " @entity28 " morning show			1
and a new day it was for @entity31 , who -- without her phone -- had no idea how much her world was about to change			1
at her airport gate to head home from @entity27 , she got a sense			2
a man who kept staring at her finally approached with a question : " are you that @entity5 person ? " coming forward , in itself , had been cathartic			1
she 'd grappled with the idea , mostly at the urging of her son , ever since she was surprised to find out she was the voice behind @entity5			1
the recordings used for the @entity5 voice had been laid down by @entity31 in 2005 , long before anyone outside of @entity22 knew that something called an @entity7 was even on the horizon			1
" i ca n't tell you how freeing it was to make that decision , " she said			2
" i 'd been torturing myself for two years			2
" after a whirlwind 10 days of travel and newfound exposure , @entity31 sat down over coffee and talked about what her life has been like since she took the leap from anonymity			1
the media frenzy to say that she got slammed with media requests would be an understatement			1
by the time @entity31 got back to @entity2 from her morning tv appearance on @entity3 's " @entity28 , " between 400 and 500 e-mails were waiting for her			1
most of them were requests for interviews			1
meanwhile , her husband , @entity77 , sat at home fielding phone calls as they poured in and asking , through the front door , for a local tv crew to leave			2
" i thought i might get a couple e-mails			2
maybe the ( @entity83 ) would want to do a little story , " @entity31 said			1
" 15 of @entity5 's best ( and worst ) jokes the requests have been global , coming from places as far - flung as the @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92			1
she stared at what was in front of her , knowing she was in over her head			2
she had no idea where to begin			2
fortunately , a hot - shot publicist in @entity100 , @entity101 of @entity102 , was prepared to take over			2
@entity31 would quickly go on to read a top 10 list for @entity104 and make appearances on " @entity106 " and @entity108 's " @entity107			1
" she 's done interviews with a handful of media outlets , including @entity113 and the @entity114 , and hit the radio morning show circuit : 18 programs in three hours alone			1
a new stable of handlers the publicist is just one person helping @entity31 navigate her new normal			1
she 's also landed @entity120 of @entity121 , one of the top voiceover agents in the nation and someone she hopes will help her reach her ultimate dream : to voice a cartoon character			1
@entity31 does n't want to discuss details but said after last week , that dream finally feels possible			1
and then there 's her son , @entity31 , a photographer in @entity100			1
on a four - day trip @entity31 recently took to @entity134 , her son played chauffeur , schlepping his sleep - deprived mother from meeting to meeting			1
he also has stepped in to manage his mom 's growing social media presence , something she 'd never focused on before			1
and that 's how her new @entity142 handle , @ @entity143 , was born			2
finding comfort in the spotlight when asked to appear on @entity3 's " @entity28 , " @entity31 was at first reticent			1
years earlier , she 'd done on - camera work , mostly for corporate videos			0
but in a world where appearance -- and , by association , age -- matters , she found herself being phased out			0
as a voiceover actor , she does n't have to worry about looks and can wear what she wants			0
there 's tremendous comfort in that			0
so the decision to step in front of live cameras was n't immediate for her			0
but she then realized that coming out as the voice of @entity5 had been the big hurdle			1
that was the scary part			0
once she did walk onto the set of " @entity28 , " she was surprised by how comfortable she was			0
" all of a sudden , that old memory of how to behave on camera came out , " said @entity31 , who declines to give her age			1
" i was n't nervous at all			0
" the caked - on makeup , though , she can do without			0
by the time she got back from her @entity134 jaunt , she said , her skin -- what with all the makeup , the drier air , the lack of sleep -- felt like it had aged 10 years			0
she got home and said all she wanted to do was face - plant into a tub of moisturizer			0
well , that and sleep			0
over four days in @entity134 , this night owl thinks she got no more than 18 hours of sleep			0
" i felt really proud of myself that i was able to do everything i was asked to do , " she said			0
" it was exciting but also exhausting			1
" unexpected -- and moving -- messages in the past 10 days , @entity31 has heard from old friends , people she has n't been in touch with for decades			1
and while most close family members were privy to her @entity5 secret , some distant relatives were not , which has meant some reconnecting that way , too			1
strangers have written , begging her to record their outgoing messages for them			0
and wannabe voiceover actors seeking advice have reached out to @entity31 , who 's trying to make a point to answer each and every e-mail -- which at last count numbered more than 600			1
but the most moving responses have come from members of the blind community			0
@entity31 has long been a voice of many @entity217 , or text - to - speech , services , beyond the technology used to create @entity5			1
for the first time , she 's received thank - you notes from people she 's served , people who 've relied on her but did n't know her name until now			0
their common message : " thanks for enabling us to do all we do , " she said			0
one writer specified that she 'd helped him work his computer , use his phone and " read " textbooks			0
realizing the tangible difference her voice has made in other people 's lives made her cry			2
" this can be a thankless business , " she said			0
" it 's so nice to know my voice is being used in a good way			2
" what 's next @entity31 feels blessed to love what she does in @entity2			1
she came home to her loving guitarist husband , her kitties , the lush trees and her quiet home			0
she 's back with her community of colleagues , musicians and friends she could n't appreciate more			0
between resting her voice from all the recent attention , she 's getting back to work -- serving the same clients , recording in her home booth , laughing with the engineers who feel like family			2
she does n't expect this flood of attention to last forever			0
she suspects that most of her " 15 minutes of fame " already came and went			0
if she continues doing what she does , she says , she 'll be fine			0
but she 's open and excited to see what might happen next			0
" life is change , " she said			2
" there 's talk of a book deal and a speaking tour , two ideas that make her shake her head in amused disbelief			0
she 's already been asked to give a keynote address at a big telecommunications conference next year			0
and if other new jobs come out of this experience -- like a cartoon offer , perhaps -- she would , of course , be thrilled			0
" i 'm grateful for all of it , " she said			0
" it 's absolutely surreal			0
" but , @entity31 insisted , none of this has changed or will change who she is			1
she looked down at her new @entity291 , the one she ca n't seem to figure out -- " why ca n't i get e-mail ? " -- and headed back to real life .			0

on october 4 , @entity3 revealed @entity1 as the original @entity6 voice of @entity5 on the @entity7
since then , @entity31 has faced a whirlwind of change
media requests , travel and new *opportunities* have been " exciting , exhausting "
