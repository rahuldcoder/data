-- six @entity2 investigators have been sentenced to between four and 14 years in jail after they drowned a local official during a botched interrogation that has shone light on @entity8 's secretive extrajudicial processes			1
@entity9 , the deputy director of the @entity10 in the eastern city of @entity12 , received the longest sentence of the six for his role in the death of @entity16 , according to a copy of the court verdict given to @entity0 by the victim 's wife			1
all the defendants pleaded guilty			0
@entity16 , 41 , the chief engineer at a state - owned company in the same city , died at a local hospital on april 9 , a month after being detained over his role in a land deal			1
after early interrogations failed to yield any admission of guilt , @entity9 summoned other investigators april 8 and ordered @entity16 to strip naked and sit in a bathtub filled with icy water			1
at @entity9 's behest , three other investigators -- @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 -- grabbed his neck , arms and legs and held him under the water			1
the two other defendants -- @entity45 and @entity46 -- entered the room later the same evening , the verdict said			0
when @entity9 left he told his subordinates : " i 'm leaving now ; you all have fun with it			0
" @entity16 was sent to hospital an hour later and died at 3am the next day , the verdict , which has not been officially released , said			2
the court said that the six interrogators attempted to drown @entity16 in order to force him to admit that he had violated the law			0
@entity16 's wife , @entity58 , told @entity0 the sentences handed down were not long enough , adding that many important facts about the case had not been aired in court			2
she said she wanted to plan for her late husband 's funeral but the @entity65 had not returned his remains			0
@entity67 , a lawyer acting on behalf of the deceased man , said that he had heard the six defendants had appealed their sentences as they believed they were too harsh			0
@entity16 was placed under investigation as part of a secretive process known as shanggui or dual designation that allows for @entity2 members to be detained and interrogated by party investigators			1
it is based on the party 's own regulations rather than laws and procedures , making it even less transparent than @entity8 's judicial system			1
legal experts view the prosecution of @entity16 's interrogators as a step forward but say that the key to preventing similar abuses is to address the root cause of his death - the rarely publicized shanggui system			2
" the six investigators arrested were mere scapegoats , " @entity94 , one of the lawyers representing the @entity16 family , told @entity0 in september			2
" @entity98 is an illegal process -- abuse and torture during interrogation have become standard operating procedure			0
" with reporting by @entity0 's @entity105 bureau			0
