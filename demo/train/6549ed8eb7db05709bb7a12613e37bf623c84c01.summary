-- adhesive in the shape of a heart was found on a corner of a piece of duct tape that was covering the mouth portion of 2 - year - old @entity11 's skeletal remains , an @entity2 latent print examiner testified monday in the capital murder trial of the girl 's mother , @entity11			1
@entity15 explained the find to jurors by asking them to think about when they remove an adhesive bandage from their skin and some of the adhesive remains in the shape of the bandage			0
instead of a bandage , however , the outline was the shape of a heart , she said , and about the size of a dime			0
although it has not been mentioned in testimony , court documents in the case have stated that a sheet of heart - shaped stickers , with some missing , were found by police executing a search warrant at the @entity39 home			1
a photograph of a page of stickers , found in a search of the home the day after @entity11 's remains were found , was admitted into evidence in the trial saturday			1
a line of investigators and forensic experts have been called to the stand by prosecutors in an effort to prove their theory that @entity39 , 25 , killed her daughter by knocking her out with chloroform and putting duct tape over her nose and mouth			1
they allege the @entity63 woman then put the body in black garbage bags and stored it in her trunk before dumping it in woods near her home			0
the skeletal remains were found in december 11 , 2008			1
@entity11 was last seen june 16 , 2008 , but her disappearance was not reported until july 15 , 2008 , after @entity39 's mother demanded answers about the little girl 's whereabouts			1
@entity39 faces seven counts in her daughter 's death , including first - degree murder , aggravated child abuse and misleading investigators			1
if convicted , she could face the death penalty			0
she has pleaded not guilty			0
her attorneys have said @entity11 was not killed but rather that she drowned in the family pool shortly after her family last reported seeing her and that @entity39 and her father , @entity39 , panicked when they discovered the body and covered up her death			1
@entity39 rejected that scenario in his testimony the first week of the trial			1
the trial is ahead of schedule , @entity95 , @entity96 , chief judge @entity93 told jurors as they took a break for lunch			2
prosecutors are down to their final witnesses , he said , but they wo n't be available until tuesday afternoon , they said			2
the prosecution may rest tuesday or wednesday , @entity93 said			1
the defense anticipated beginning its case thursday but is trying to accelerate that process and begin wednesday , the judge said			1
he said he believes testimony in the case could conclude by the end of next week , although he can not say for sure			1
deliberations could begin by june 25 , he said			0
the court recessed until 1 p.m. tuesday			2
@entity15 said she found the heart - shaped adhesive while examining the three pieces of duct tape found on @entity11 's remains for fingerprints			1
she said she did n't find fingerprints but did n't expect to , given the months the tape and the remains had been outdoors and exposed to the elements			2
any oil or sweat from a person 's fingertips would have long since deteriorated , she said			0
asked whether she tried to photograph the heart - shaped adhesive , which she saw under an ultraviolet light as part of her testing , @entity15 said she did not			2
" when i observe something is unexpected , i note it and continue with my examination , " she said			0
she said she tried to photograph it later after subjecting the tape to dye testing , but the adhesive was no longer visible			2
she testified she did show it to her supervisor			0
earlier monday , jurors heard more testimony about a hair found in @entity39 's trunk and hairs found with @entity11 's remains			1
however , @entity93 would not permit @entity145 , a hair and fiber examiner for the @entity2 , to show jurors a @entity150 presentation dealing with a study he is conducting on hair decomposition			1
@entity39 's defense attorneys protested vigorously , saying they had not received a copy of the presentation or had a chance to adequately review it			2
" the court does find it troubling that the state , at the ninth hour , provides a powerpoint with color photographs that was not provided to the defense , " @entity93 said			0
the dispute over the presentation was heard outside the jury 's presence			0
@entity93 did allow @entity145 to testify about the study			0
@entity145 told jurors that he examined the hair and a " hair mass " found with @entity11 's remains and that he came to the same conclusion as @entity2 trace evidence examiner @entity172			1
@entity174 previously testified that a 9 - inch piece of hair from the trunk appeared similar to a piece of hair recovered from the little girl 's hairbrush and had a dark band that she had seen only in hairs that remained in the scalp of a decomposing body			2
@entity145 said he agreed with @entity174 's findings , adding that the " hair mass " found with the remains had a " brushlike " appearance associated with a later stage of decomposition			2
@entity145 noted , however , as @entity174 did before him , that hair identification is not an exact science and that he can not say the hair was @entity11 's , to the exclusion of all other people			2
in addition , the " hair mass " " is not a suitable normal hair sample , " he said , and he can not say with certainty it was @entity11 's hair , only that it was found with her remains			1
@entity145 said that in his study , he was attempting to recreate banding in hairs taken from living people			0
while he said some of the hairs -- which were put in varying indoor and outdoor locations -- showed evidence of decomposition , none showed postmortem banding			0
however , under cross-examination by defense attorney @entity215 , @entity145 admitted he can not state definitively that postmortem banding is exclusively seen in hair taken from dead people			0
two independent examiners as part of his study both analyzed the hairs , and each in their initial findings identified a hair as banded from a live person , although they both discounted that in their confirmed findings , he said			0
but @entity145 estimated for prosecutor @entity227 that he 's seen thousands of hairs in his career and that he has never seen a hair with a decomposition band that did not come from a corpse			0
@entity215 also elicited testimony from @entity145 that it was his first time testifying in court about such evidence			2
on saturday , an insect expert testified that tiny flies found in the trunk of the @entity63 woman 's car fit the theory that @entity11 's body was stored there -- perhaps for three to five days			1
the flies suggest that something began to decompose inside the trunk but do not prove that the material was a human body , said @entity249 , a forensic entomologist from @entity250 in @entity251 , @entity252			0
such flies will feed on many things , he said			0
based on his analysis of temperatures and the reproductive habits of the small flies found on paper towels from the trunk that another scientist found were soaked in fluid from decomposition , @entity249 said it appeared that whatever attracted the flies had been in the car for three to five days			2
@entity215 , in his cross-examination of @entity249 , tried to show that the flies could have been attracted by common garbage or leftover food			0
numerous witnesses have testified to a foul odor emanating from @entity39 's trunk after her daughter 's disappearance ; a bag of garbage left in the trunk for weeks has been suggested as the source of the smell , but prosecutors allege it was the smell of human decomposition			1
saturday 's testimony also included a crime scene investigator who collected a piece of @entity289 brand duct tape from an area near where @entity11 's skull was found			1
@entity292 , a forensics supervisor for the @entity293 , also testified that despite a thorough search of the house , the only piece of @entity289 duct tape investigators recovered from the home @entity39 shared with her daughter and parents was attached to a gas can			1
last week , jurors saw graphic photos of @entity11 's bones and heard testimony that they had been gnawed by animals as her body decomposed during as much as six months in the field			1
they also watched a video superimposing an image of @entity11 's skull over her living face and an outline of a strip of duct tape in an effort to prove tape could have been , in effect , the murder weapon , @entity227 said			1
@entity215 tried to prevent jurors from seeing the presentation , which he called " disgusting			0
" but @entity93 ruled that the role of duct tape in the girl 's death is " highly relevant			1
" he also rejected a defense motion for a mistrial based on the video at the close of friday 's session			0
in @entity333 's @entity332 and @entity334 contributed to this report			0
