-- general @entity1 , one of the finest soldiers of his generation , performed a final act of service for his country when he fell on his sword			1
it was a sad moment but , as a life - long patriot , he knew he had to resign as secretary of veterans affairs			1
as good an officer as he was , he could no longer expect to lead his huge department , a bureaucracy second in size only to @entity15 and representing nearly 15 % of the entire federal civilian work force			2
evidence has been piling up that he and his top lieutenants knew shockingly little about misdeeds within the department , despite years of negative reports			2
and he was rapidly losing the confidence of @entity23 , the public and most importantly , veterans			2
now , attention can rightly expand from investigations of the past -- though they must go on -- to how to fix the future			0
a @entity31 that has hardly covered itself with glory needs to get on top of the problem and stay aggressively there			2
the place to start is to appoint a world - class leader to run the place and recruit a squad of young , talented veterans from @entity41 and @entity42 as a personal support team			1
unfortunately , the best person in the country to run the @entity46 is the least available : @entity47			1
no one knows more or as has been more effective in running large , massive public institutions than @entity47			0
he was not only superb at running the @entity50 but was then successful in running @entity51 ( the seventh - largest university in the country ) and went on to serve with great distinction as secretary of defense , winding down two wars for presidents @entity56 and @entity58			2
@entity59 : @entity58 defeated by bureaucracy ? but @entity47 is now happy in retirement in @entity66 , thousands of miles away from @entity64 if you have seen him on a book tour , you may have noticed the neck brace he had to wear for a few months			0
he jokes that one morning over breakfast he told his wife he was thinking of returning to @entity64 and the next thing he knew , he woke up in the hospital with a broken neck			0
the point is that the @entity46 desperately needs a leader who can overhaul an agency notoriously resistant to change , someone who knows a lot about military culture			1
after @entity81 , the next best choice is likely to be his last deputy at @entity83 , @entity84			1
( disclosure : @entity84 is a friend and esteemed colleague from the @entity87			1
) @entity84 won very high marks among civilians and military as deputy secretary , the person who " runs the building			1
" the @entity31 may also find a retired four - star general who would be a good fit ; retired gen. @entity95 , whom the president tapped to help out with negotiations in the @entity98 , quickly comes to mind			1
but the roster of people who would be strong choices is actually quite limited , so the search must be relentlessly tough - minded			0
even so , this is not a one - person job			0
a new secretary will need reinforcements			0
there are none better than some of the veterans who have come back from @entity41 and @entity42 , peeled off their uniforms , and volunteered to continue their service as civilians -- rightful heirs of the @entity117 generation			1
a smart @entity31 would recruit some of the best among them and put them to work fixing the @entity46 in some imaginative way -- possibly in full - time stints , possibly in consulting teams			1
an obvious candidate as leader : lt. cmdr			0
@entity127 , a @entity128 , @entity129 , veteran of several tours , best - selling author , founder of the veterans group , @entity135 ( i serve on its board )			2
in recent years , i have had the privilege of teaching a number of veterans who have pursued graduate degrees at @entity142			0
they are extraordinarily talented and ready to help			0
start with @entity144 , for example : @entity147 undergrad , @entity148 officer in @entity41 , graduate of the @entity149 and @entity87 , now rising in leadership ranks at @entity151 and serving on a federal veterans advisory board			0
top talent is ready and willing			0
why not ask them for help ? @entity41 and @entity42 veterans have had too little voice in the @entity46			1
it 's time to call on the best to serve their country again .			0

@entity162 : an *admirable* @entity1 performed *selfless* act of service be resigning @entity46 post
@entity46 needs world - class leader with support team of ex-servicemen and women , he says
@entity162 : it 's a narrow field of *qualified* . @entity84 . retired general @entity95 would be good
@entity162 most crucial is recruiting top - *flight* veterans who can help imaginatively pull @entity46 into shape
