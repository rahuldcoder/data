-- in the history of the modern @entity4 few , if any , performances have captured the popular imagination in quite the same way as that of @entity9 @entity8 at the @entity10			2
@entity8 defied @entity11 by winning four gold medals in @entity13 in 1936			1
his haul of four gold medals -- in the 100 meters , 200 meters , long jump and 4x100 meters relay -- would have been a notable achievement under any circumstances , especially since two of his victories resulted in new world records			1
what gave his feat its unique resonance , however , was the fact that it took place at a games organized by @entity11 's @entity30 , and specifically designed as a showcase for white @entity33 talent			1
as a black man , @entity8 ' quadruple triumph was a huge embarrassment to the hosts , and a defiant snub to the @entity40 's theories of white racial supremacy			1
no other sporting performance before or since has achieved quite the same level of symbolism			0
the 11th olympiad had been awarded to @entity46 in may 1931 , two years before @entity11 and his @entity30 party came to power			2
their overtly racist policies -- including the exclusion of all jews and gypsies from @entity46 sporting facilities -- led to widespread calls to either move or boycott the competition , especially in @entity57 and the @entity9 despite that the @entity29 went ahead , with 49 countries and a total of 4,066 athletes participating , more than in any previous @entity4			0
from the outset the @entity30 propaganda machine made the most of the opportunity presented by the @entity29			2
for their two - week duration -- from august 1 - 16 -- houses and monuments throughout @entity13 were decked with @entity30 flags and banners , while posters and magazine spreads lauded the ideal of the white @entity33 athlete , making an overt link between the racial purity of modern @entity79 culture and that of classical @entity81			1
director @entity82 -- dubbed " @entity11 's film - maker " -- was employed to capture the anticipated @entity46 triumphs on camera			1
at the same time stringent efforts were made to play down the darker aspects of @entity30 ideology , including the removal from @entity13 's streets of all anti-jewish signs , and an order that foreign nationals were not to be subject to @entity46 's oppressive anti-homosexual laws			2
@entity30 showcasing it was against this background of tightly regimented @entity30 showcasing that , on august 3 , @entity8 started competing in @entity13 's 100,000 - seater @entity99 , winning his first gold medal in the 100 meters ( equaling the @entity4 record with his time of 10.3 seconds )			1
over the next six days he would take a further three golds , in the process setting two new world records -- for the 200 meters and 4x100 meter relay -- and incensing the @entity30 authorities ( @entity112 , the minister for propaganda , privately described his victories as " a disgrace " )			0
the @entity8 myth is admittedly not quite as clear - cut as it has sometimes been presented			0
@entity46 spectators were open in their admiration for the @entity9 , and he would probably have not won the long jump gold had it not been for advice given to him by his main rival in the event , the star @entity46 athlete @entity125			0
his place in the 4x100 meter relay team , meanwhile , was only secured when @entity9 team managers dropped two @entity131 athletes -- @entity132 and @entity133 -- allegedly at the behest of @entity11 himself			0
claims that the latter refused to shake hands with @entity8 were also unfounded -- the @entity46 leader had been told at the start of the @entity29 that he should either shake every athlete 's hand or none , and had chosen the latter option			1
despite that , and the fact that @entity46 still came top of the overall medal standings , the domination of a black athlete at a games so overtly dedicated to promoting the ideal of @entity33 physical perfection proved hugely symbolic for , and satisfying to a world increasingly alarmed at the activities of the @entity40			0
there is a depressing coda to the @entity8 story , however , for the hero of the @entity10 subsequently returned home to an @entity9 that was itself tainted by profound racial discrimination			0
although he received a @entity163 ticker - tape parade , he was snubbed by president @entity164 , and , because of his color , failed to attract the commercial sponsorship deals awarded to his fellow white athletes			0
as @entity8 himself commented : " although i was n't invited to shake hands with @entity11 , i was n't invited to the @entity170 to shake hands with the president either			2

@entity11 's @entity30 designed the @entity29 as a showcase for white @entity33 talent
@entity176 won his first gold medal in the 100 meters
@entity8 ' quadruple triumph was a huge embarrassment to the hosts
