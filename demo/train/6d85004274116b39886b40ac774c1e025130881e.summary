-- the power of any pastor over his or her parishioners is derived from their " calling " to minister the gospel from @entity10 , or as some call it , the anointing by the @entity8			2
but the role of a pastor -- the @entity13 speaks to being a shepherd of a flock -- also comes from the belief that it is their moral standing as the earthly representative of @entity10 to lead their congregations spiritually			2
if you read the writings of @entity24 in 1 @entity25 ( @entity26 ) , he offers the following instructions : " here is a trustworthy saying : if anyone sets his heart on being an overseer , he desires a noble task			0
now the overseer must be above reproach , the husband of but one wife , temperate , self - controlled , respectable , hospitable , able to teach , not given to drunkenness , not violent but gentle , not quarrelsome , not a lover of money			0
he must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him with proper respect			0
( if anyone does not know how to manage his own family , how can he take care of @entity10 's church ) ... he must also have a good reputation with outsiders , so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil 's trap			2
" as we witness the salacious and troubling sex allegations leveled this week against @entity56 megachurch pastor bishop @entity55 , it is clear that many are confused to hear four young men come forward and allege that the man of the cloth , the husband and father , sexually coerced them and used the power of his prophetic position to engage in sex with them			1
it is even more shocking considering @entity55 has preached with conviction against homosexuality and gay marriage			1
the details outlined in three lawsuits -- a fourth man stepped forward on friday -- have rocked the @entity74 community			2
bishop @entity55 is n't just a preacher with a storefront church			1
he oversees a massive 240 - acre complex in @entity78 , @entity79 , just outside of @entity56 , a congregation of 25,000 members , schools , and an international ministry that is seen on @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and online			0
he is widely respected as a strong man of @entity10 who ministers annually to fellow pastors , men , youth and a mega women 's conference			0
his influence is tremendous and far reaching , even in the areas of education and politics in @entity79			1
with all that said , and i fully understand that he has vigorously denied the allegations , there is no doubt in my mind that for the sake of the church , @entity55 and his family , he needs to remove himself from the pulpit as the leader of @entity111 in order for the issue to be resolved to its conclusion			1
in an interview with me on thursday on the @entity116 , @entity55 's attorney , @entity117 , said his client would speak for the first time on sunday at 11 a.m. and address the issue before his congregation			1
while i disagree with waiting five days since the allegations were revealed -- if someone accused me of doing this and i know in my heart i did n't do it , i would be screaming from the top of @entity79 's @entity128 -- long first and foremost owes an explanation to his personal family , and then his church family			1
if he does indeed stand before the @entity111 family , @entity55 should be honest and forthright , not mince words or engage in double talk			1
and after whatever he says , he should take it upon himself to " sit himself down			0
" in the @entity143 , when a pastor is accused of wrongdoing , going through a divorce or violating the biblical call to be above " reproach , " the senior pastor orders them to be " sat down			0
" that means they do n't carry out their ministerial duties			0
the point is to protect the integrity of the @entity150 , as well as to allow that pastor to get his or her affairs in order			0
as the leader of @entity156 , there is no human authority above @entity55			1
but he has a heavenly father that he has to answer to , and he must not allow his personal travails to interfere with the good and expansive works of the church			2
souls still need to be saved , people still need to be healed , the sick still must be cared for , and the naked clothed			0
yet i also hope that when @entity55 speaks , he does one of two things : if in his mind and heart he has done no wrong , he will launch a vigorous defense of his name and integrity and vow with every fiber in his body to fight the charges , even if that means spending every dime he has and not settle the lawsuits			1
but if he is guilty of what is alleged , i pray that @entity55 does n't stand before his church as its spiritual father and continue the charade of saying " i did n't do it " and tear into his accusers			1
@entity10 , @entity55 and those young men know what took place , and as someone who has listened to many of his sermons and read his books , @entity55 has often talked about the need for @entity194 , especially men , to be accountable for their actions and confess their sins			1
if guilty , and if he truly cares about his enormous flock , he will stand before them and admit to the error of his ways , and not put them through more pain and heartache			2
he is a charismatic pastor who has always been known to preach an uncompromising @entity204 , unwilling to say what folks want to hear , but instead , what they need to hear			0
@entity209 , your congregation and the world do n't want to hear excuses			1
they do n't want ambiguity			0
your motto at @entity111 for years has been " taking @entity216			0
" this is the time for you to live that credo out before your flock , no matter what the outcome will be			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity225 .			2

four lawsuits have been filed against bishop @entity55
@entity225 says @entity209 has tremendous influence in the black church and beyond
he says @entity209 should step down to deal with the allegations
@entity225 : he should vigorously defend his name or admit the *misdeeds* if they *happened*
