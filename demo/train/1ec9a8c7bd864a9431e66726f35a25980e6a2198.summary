@entity0 as parents , we want to be careful to protect our children from the wrong influences			2
just because someone is famous and has a following among a certain segment of society does n't mean they 're a good role model for youth			0
one group in particular comes to mind			0
they 're essentially minimally talented narcissists who are starved for public attention , and they will say and do shocking and inappropriate things to get it			0
truth be known , many of them are not the best people in the world			0
i speak , of course , of politicians — and , in particular , of @entity27			1
the former @entity29 governor and @entity31 presidential candidate is rumored to be interested — along with about 14 other @entity31 hopefuls — in making a @entity34 bid in 2016			1
it will be a long , hard slog for @entity27 , a second - tier candidate , who — if he enters the race — is likely to find himself battling former sen. @entity38 of @entity39 , retired neurosurgeon @entity40 , and sen. @entity41 of @entity42 for the votes of evangelical @entity44			1
@entity31 believe that president @entity45 is in over his head , and they want to restore adult supervision to the @entity34			1
@entity27 , who until recently hosted a cable television show , has a juvenile habit of shooting from the lip with commentary that is unplugged and unfiltered			1
in the process of making the press rounds for his new book , " @entity55 , @entity56 , " @entity27 has already said a few things — about the first family and pop star @entity58 — that are hostile , hurtful , hateful and harmful			1
in fact , in a recent interview for @entity62 , he did n't just step on one minefield but a whole lot of them			0
concerning the @entity67 , @entity27 is shocked that the president and first lady @entity69 allow their daughters , @entity67 and @entity71 , to be part of @entity58 's fan base			1
as an ordained baptist minister , @entity27 does n't approve of some of the performer 's songs and on - stage behavior			1
and now , music critic			0
the @entity31 sees a conflict between how conscientious the @entity67 are about most things concerning their daughters , and this one area where the girls have the freedom to idolize one of their favorite entertainers			0
@entity91 : @entity58 , what have you done ? " i do n't understand how on one hand they can be such doting parents and so careful about the intake of everything — how much broccoli they eat and where they go to school , and making sure they 're kind of sheltered and shielded from so many things , " @entity27 told the magazine			1
" and yet they do n't see anything that might not be suitable for either a preteen or a teen in some of the lyrical content and choreography of @entity58			2
" @entity27 was just getting warmed up			2
his next target : @entity110 , music mogul and @entity58 's husband			1
about @entity110 , @entity27 wonders : " does it occur to him that he is arguably crossing the line from husband to pimp by exploiting his wife as a sex object ? " @entity118 did not just go there			1
for someone who communicates for a living , you would think that @entity27 would know enough to avoid taking one of the most successful @entity127 - @entity126 businessmen in the country and comparing him to — of all things — a pimp			2
really ? while @entity31 like sen. @entity131 of @entity132 talk about the importance of reaching out to african - americans , @entity27 may have reached a new low in terms of offending them			2
so where did @entity27 go wrong ? first , if you have a problem with the president , take it to him but leave his kids out of it			1
second , if you want to come across to the rest of @entity126 as a serious candidate , try talking about serious things and avoid these @entity148 - @entity147 moments where you try to score points off something in popular culture			0
third , if you do n't see the problem with comparing a prominent and successful @entity127 - @entity126 businessman with a pimp , you had better check your common sense tank but you 're running low			2
fourth , leave the music reviews to the professionals , and , the next time you decide to attack a performer , try choosing an outlier and not someone so embedded in the mainstream that she has sold more than 75 million records — just as a solo artist			0
and fifth , you can critique the other side 's policies all day long but you should really skip the parenting advice since it 's one thing to accuse someone of being a bad president , and quite another to say they 're a bad parent			1
you just do n't go there			0
even in the brass - knuckled world of politics , there are rules to be followed and lines that should not be crossed			0
for that , he ought to be ashamed			0
and he ought to be apologetic			0
then he ought to be quiet .			0

@entity27 is rumored to be interested in running for president in 2016
