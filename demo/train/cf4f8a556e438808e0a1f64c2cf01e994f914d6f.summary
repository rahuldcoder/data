-- over the course of her remarkable life , @entity1 was many things to many people -- an accomplished jazz singer , a saxophone player , an actress and the first black woman to play on the professional golf circuit			1
for @entity11 and tennis fans around the globe , however , @entity1 will always be best remembered as a towering figure of their sport			1
and not just because of her imposing stature			2
" i saw @entity1 play ( tennis ) for the first time when i was 13			1
because she was already one of my ' she - roes ' i was very excited " says @entity11 , who herself won 12 grand slam singles titles as well as founding the @entity26			1
" her story is quite unexpected and quite wonderful at the same time , " she told @entity0 's @entity29			2
@entity1 won an impressive 11 grand slam crowns ( five singles , five doubles and one mixed doubles ) between 1956 and 1958			1
" she was so exciting to watch , " @entity11 says			0
" she was almost six feet and she had long arms , long legs -- very intimidating to the other players , you could tell			0
" while @entity11 herself is rightly lauded as one of the all - time tennis greats , the achievements of her idol @entity1 are often overlooked			1
perhaps this is to do with fading memories , the inaccessibility of the grainy black - and - white footage that recorded her in action , or the fact that tennis remained an amateur sport during @entity1 's playing days			1
for tennis historians , however , her legacy remains an important part of the sport 's history			2
@entity1 inspired prominent black players including three - time men 's grand slam winner @entity62 , 1990 women 's @entity66 finalist @entity65 and modern day greats like the @entity70 sisters			1
@entity70 once said she had all the opportunities she has today " because of people like @entity1			1
" for @entity1 to achieve what she did , however , she had to scrap , battle and overcome barriers that few of her contemporaries would have been faced with			1
forgotten legend born in @entity79 in 1927 before being raised in @entity82 's tough @entity81 district , @entity1 spent much of her youth playing ping - pong or practicing on local tennis courts			1
aware of her special talent , the tight - knit @entity81 community raised funds to help pay for coaching lessons			0
according to friend @entity94 , former mayor of @entity82 , her ability was obvious from a young age			0
" ( @entity96 ) learned her tennis much like @entity11 , just hitting against walls and she was pretty damn good , " @entity94 says			2
" she was tall and she had a good serve / volley ... she was tough			0
" she had to be			0
@entity100 in the late 1940s and early ' 50s was a very different place than it is today			0
the dark specter of racial segregation still hung over many parts of the country			0
" it was @entity100 apartheid , like @entity108 , " @entity94 says			0
" but that 's the way we were			0
most tennis was played at country clubs and places that did n't admit people of color , so it was tough for her			2
" but the young @entity1 was nothing if not resilient			1
with the backing of family , friends and the @entity123 -- an organization that identified and helped talented young @entity125 - @entity100 players -- she graduated high school before being admitted to @entity127 on a full athletic scholarship in 1949			0
" she had a community that really loved her and made a huge difference in her life , " @entity11 says			0
" these people really were there for @entity1 , as a person			1
you do n't have to have the whole world behind you but if you have a nucleus of friends who care , i think that 's probably what got her though it			0
" @entity1 would also find she had advocates within the game as she progressed from playing in local and regional tournaments			1
an impassioned appeal from 18 - time grand slam winner @entity149 is widely credited with ensuring @entity1 became the first black player to receive an invitation to appear at the @entity153 ( the forerunner to the @entity154 ) in 1953			1
" if tennis is a game for ladies and gentlemen ... it 's time we acted a little more like gentle - people and less like sanctimonious hypocrites , " @entity149 wrote in @entity155			2
impressive performances ensured appearances at other championships and tournaments soon followed			0
@entity1 's first major triumph duly arrived at the 1956 @entity169 in @entity170			1
@entity66 and @entity100 @entity172 titles followed a year later as she became first @entity125 - @entity100 player to win at any of these tournaments			1
" i do n't know if she appreciated fully the magnitude of what she had accomplished , to be the first at anything is by definition an achievement , " @entity94 says of the breakthrough victories			0
on returning to @entity82 after winning @entity66 in 1957 , @entity1 became only the second black athlete after 1936 @entity185 hero @entity184 to be granted a ticker tape parade through the city 's streets			1
" i think as an african - american winning @entity66 in the mid- ' 50s and having the @entity190 present on @entity191 with the whole world watching , it had to be so joyous , " @entity11 says			0
" i can tell you for people that cared about desegregation and wanting to get us all together , what an uplifting moment that had to be			0
" @entity1 herself , however often tried to distance herself from issues of race , and disliked being seen as a pioneer for the @entity125 - @entity100 community			1
the @entity208 wrote in her obituary in 2003 that " when a reporter asked if she was proud to be compared to ( baseball player ) @entity213 as an outstanding representative of her race , @entity1 replied : ' no. i do n't consider myself to be a representative of my people			1
i am thinking of me and nobody else			0
' " early retirement @entity1 would repeat the feat of winning @entity66 and the @entity100 @entity172 titles in 1958 but would retire soon after at the age of just 31			1
while the 2014 @entity154 winner can expect to pick up $ 3 million as well as the coveted silver trophy , there was no prize money for the major champions in @entity1 's era			1
" she would always answer truthfully about how it was difficult and that everything with her after she finished , " @entity11 says			0
" it was just difficult to make a living			0
" @entity1 was a fine singer and recorded an album upon retirement in an effort to cash in on her fame			1
she also appeared in the movie " @entity241 " with @entity242			1
she then decided to take up professional golf and in 1962 became the first black woman on the @entity245			1
despite being the possessor of a powerful swing , @entity1 never won a tournament and golf was never a lucrative endeavor for her			1
a number of roles in sports administration soon followed , as well as in local government bodies in @entity256			0
by the late ' 80s and early ' 90s , however , a series of illnesses had struck			0
medical bills mounted and her inability to work left her struggling to afford rent and medication			0
upon learning of @entity1 's plight , @entity11 decided to step up to help her " she - ro			2
" " we all tried to get people to pitch in a few dollars because we heard she was n't doing well , and we certainly did not want her to go hungry or not have shelter , " she says			0
" i think we raised at least $ 50,000 to give to her so she could live in the way she deserved to live , being such a great champion			0
" for @entity94 , however , that @entity1 's situation ever got to requiring donations from fans to keep her going is a damning indictment of both the sport in @entity1 's day and wider society			2
" it 's too bad that we as a society failed to recognize those among us who should be revered and whose accomplishments should be praised , and that has been the case with @entity1 , " he says			2
" there 's so many people who have never heard of @entity1			2
tennis fans ... they think tennis started with @entity11			2
in many ways it did , but it 's sad that more people do n't know about her ( @entity1 ) and who she was			2
" @entity11 agrees wholeheartedly with this sentiment			0
although @entity1 died over a decade ago , aged 76 , @entity11 remains keen to publicize the seminal role she played in the sport of tennis and how she inspired a generation of black athletes to pick up a racquet			1
" because of @entity1 , people like @entity62 , @entity311 and all these different people of color would n't have had the opportunity , " the 70 - year - old says			2
" we need people to pay attention now and preserve her legacy to her , we all owe her big			0
i just hope we will continue to honor her			0
