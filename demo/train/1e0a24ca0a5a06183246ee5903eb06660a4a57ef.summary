@entity0 -- just five days into his arbitration hearing , @entity2 filed suit friday in @entity5 against @entity6 and its commissioner , @entity7			1

" the lawsuit claims that in its investigation of @entity14 and his @entity14 anti-aging clinic in @entity16 , @entity6 engaged in vigilante justice to prove that @entity2 was using performance enhancing drugs			1
attorney : @entity2 had ' consulting relationship ' with @entity14 " they have ignored the procedures set forth in baseball 's collectively bargained labor agreements ; violated the strict confidentiality imposed by these agreements ; paid individuals millions of dollars and made promises of future employment to individuals in order to get them to produce documents and to testify on @entity6 ' s behalf ; bullied and intimidated those individuals who refused to cooperate with their witch hunt ; and singled out ( @entity2 ) for an unprecedented 211 - game suspension -- the longest non-permanent ban in baseball history , " the suit says			1
@entity2 , 38 , is fighting to overturn the suspension and has hired a high - priced team of lawyers , publicists and investigators			2
he has shown up each day during this week 's arbitration process at @entity6 's @entity48 headquarters			0
his lawsuit outside the arbitration process is an effort to save his reputation and his $ 25 million salary for the 2014 season			0
@entity2 says the investigation , which was supposed to stay private , has permanently harmed his reputation and ensured that he will never again secure any endorsement contracts			0
the 31 - page document includes a litany of allegations , including that @entity6 went around collective bargain agreements to make an example of @entity2 and to " gloss over @entity7 's past inaction and tacit approval of the use of performance enhancing substances in baseball and to secure his legacy as the savior of @entity72 's pastime			1
" @entity2 fights suspension there are accusations that a representative of @entity6 purchased stolen documents for $ 150,000 in cash , documents presumably that would document @entity2 's use of performance enhancing drugs			1
in addition , the document says the same @entity6 representative engaged in an inappropriate sexual relationship with a witness in the case against @entity2			2
the suit suggests that in exchange for @entity14 's assistance , @entity6 promised to provide him security , pay his legal bills , and indemnify him for civil liability that may arise from his cooperation			1
it accuses @entity7 of conducting a witch hunt , and attacks his tenure as commissioner , mentioning the strike in 1994 - 1995			0
it also gives says steroids were used by other players , including @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106			0
the suit says that in its investigation of @entity2 in the @entity14 case that is currently before an arbitration panel at @entity6 headquarters in @entity0 , baseball officials paid millions of dollars to individuals and bullied and intimidated them to produce documents that incriminated @entity2 and to testify on @entity6 's behalf			1
the document alleges that the lawsuit filed by @entity6 against @entity14 is a sham aimed at obtaining information about @entity6 players			2
@entity2 : ' i 'm fighting for my life ' @entity2 is seeking compensatory and punitive damages from @entity6 , which he accuses of leaking stories to the media during the @entity14 investigation			1
he also says an appearance by @entity7 on @entity129 's show turned what was supposed to be a confidential disciplinary and appeal process into a public trial			0
" taking down mr. @entity2 , " the suit contends , " would vividly demonstrate that commissioner @entity7 had learned from the errors of his previous explicit or tacit tolerance of steroid use			0
" @entity6 's actions were " done solely with the intent of harming mr. @entity2 and interfering with his business relationships , " the suit says			2
in response , @entity6 issued a statement friday calling the lawsuit " a clear violation of the confidentiality provisions of our drug program " and an attempt to circumvent the collective bargaining agreement that laid out how @entity6 and the @entity151 handle the grievance process			1
" while we vehemently deny the allegations in the complaint , none of those allegations is relevant to the real issue : whether mr. @entity2 violated the @entity158 and @entity159 by using and possessing numerous forms of prohibited performance - enhancing substances , including testosterone and human growth hormone , over the course of multiple years and whether he violated the @entity166 by attempting to cover up his violations of the program by engaging in a course of conduct intended to obstruct and frustrate the @entity172 's investigation			2
" in a statement to @entity1 , @entity2 said , " the entire legal dynamic is very complex , and my legal team is doing what they need to in order to vindicate me and pursue all of my rights			0
this matter is entirely separate from the ongoing arbitration			0
i look forward to the arbitration proceedings continuing , and for the day to come when i can share my story with the public and my supporters			0
" @entity2 's suspension was far longer than the punishment handed down to 13 other players connected to @entity14			1
the others , including stars @entity190 of the @entity192 and @entity193 of the @entity194 , accepted their suspensions and did n't fight the league			0
