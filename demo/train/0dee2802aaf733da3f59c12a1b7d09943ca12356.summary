the latest wound is largely self - inflicted			0
@entity3 and the new @entity1 exchanges are competing for the same young and healthy customers that @entity1 needs to survive -- and @entity3 's winning			1
president @entity7 and the entire @entity8 have nobody else but themselves to blame			0
in its hubris , the @entity8 members assured the country again and again in 2009 and 2010 that it knew enough to be able to forcibly reorganize one - sixth of the @entity16 economy without causing millions to lose their current health insurance coverage , without triggering skyrocketing costs and without causing a host of terrible unintended consequences			1
the problem is that it is impossible			0
the information that would be required to competently manage @entity16 's health care economy is too vast , complex and dispersed throughout the economy and among millions of people			1
it is impossible for anyone to know or control			0
and repeated assurances by @entity7 and virtually every @entity31 that it was possible are the greatest lie perpetrated by the supporters of @entity1			2
consider the latest illustration of this destructive hubris of the @entity8			0
to make @entity1 work , the @entity37 needs to attract 2.7 million @entity16 under the age of 35 , out of 7 million uninsured , into the new @entity1 health insurance exchanges next year -- the young invincibles most averse to buying insurance in the first place			1
if the young do n't sign up in big numbers , the cost of insurance premiums and government subsidies balloons to pay the expense of taking care of older , sicker enrollees			1
an actuarial death spiral begins , with increasing costs leading to fewer and fewer young people signing up and making the problem worse and worse until the insurance companies can no longer afford to manage the program and exit the market			2
but what the architects of @entity1 apparently failed to take into account is that many young people are also eligible for @entity3 and will enroll in that government program instead , in the 25 states that have agreed to expand @entity3			1
according to a study by the @entity68 , more than half of the total uninsured population qualified for @entity3 since they earn less than 138 % of the federal poverty level in the states that have expanded @entity3			2
since income grows with education and experience , the younger these uninsured are , the more likely they are to qualify for @entity3 because they are also poorer			2
and since @entity3 is free for these young people , that means no premiums are going to the insurance companies to subsidize the older enrollees			1
the other challenge in signing up young people is that the @entity1 law also made it possible for young people to stay on their parents ' plan until the age of 26 , further reducing the pool of the eligible young who can subsidize the old and sick			1
only 21 % of the uninsured population are in the target age bracket of 26 to 34			0
this has set up an enrollment battle between @entity3 and the new insurance exchanges for this same pool of customers			2
early evidence from @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 suggests that the young who do sign up are enrolling overwhelmingly in @entity3			1
according to an article in the @entity106 , figures released in october showed that most of the young enrollees were signing up for @entity3			1
data from @entity102 tell the story ; 47,966 residents enrolled via the exchanges , but only 8,780 signed up for insurance			0
the remaining 82 % went to @entity3			0
worse still , only 19 % of the @entity113 who bought insurance were between 18 and 34 years of age			0
in the @entity102 , eight times as many of the young cohort enrolled in @entity3 as insurance plans			2
if these trends hold up , @entity1 's exchanges will implode financially			2
instead , we need a " breakout			0
" technology and the entrepreneurial spirit of @entity16 have the capability to deliver better health care at lower cost for all @entity16			1
we need to replace @entity1 with reforms designed to allow us to live longer , happier and healthier lives far into the future			0
it all starts with an honest recognition that a one - size - fits - all model of health care can not work in a country as large and diverse as ours			1
we need reforms tailored for individuals who can choose what is best for them			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity145 .			0

@entity145 : @entity3 and @entity1 exchanges compete for the young
@entity149 : @entity16 health care is too vast and complex for one - size - fits - all program
he says the young must sign up to offset the cost of older , sicker enrollees
@entity149 : technology , entrepreneurial spirit could deliver better health care
