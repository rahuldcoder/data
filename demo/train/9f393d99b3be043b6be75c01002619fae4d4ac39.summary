@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 does n't mince words when she looks back at herself five years ago			1
" i was basically a crackhead , " @entity5 said			2
" i literally was getting arrested every other week			2
i got pregnant by a drug dealer			2
... i was seven months pregnant , and i was still smoking crack			2
" when she finally gave birth to her daughter , @entity5 was behind bars , serving a 90 - day jail sentence for possessing crack cocaine , violating her probation			1
it was a wake - up call			2
" that was the most traumatizing experience of my life , " @entity5 said			2
" to go see my beautiful , healthy baby girl in an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs and shackles ... i was embarrassed that was the way i brought her into this world			2
" i knew i was changing my life			2
i just did n't know how i was going to change my life			1
" fortunately , @entity5 connected with @entity27 , a nonprofit that reaches out to convicted mothers at five correctional facilities in @entity1			1
now , at 38 , she says she is drug - free , has a job she loves and is raising her daughter in an apartment of her own			2
" when you see what ( these women ) can do with support and love and education , it 's miraculous , really , " said sister @entity34 , who founded @entity27			1
" they do n't believe in a future and are hung up on the mistakes of their life			1
and life is not about a mistake			0
we all get a gift of life , and we have to live it			0
" over the past 25 years , @entity54 's group has provided life - changing assistance to more than 9,000 mothers both behind and beyond bars			1
its goal is to reintegrate former inmates into society by helping them with common post-release stumbling blocks , such as reuniting families and finding safe , affordable housing			0
it also provides the women with free counseling , education and employment support			1
" everybody loves children , and they 're an easy sell , " @entity54 said			1
" but the mothers , for many of them , their lives were so horrific growing up , and they did n't have what children deserve			1
they ended up on the negative side of life			0
" if you do n't get the support and tools , you ca n't give it to your child			1
... it 's a dead end all around			0
" hour children -- named in part because jailed mothers get only an hour at a time to visit with their children -- begins counseling women at least three months before their release			1
women are referred to the group by corrections workers , or they can reach out directly			1
most have family histories of substance abuse , physical abuse , mental illness and other types of trauma , @entity94 says			0
according to the @entity1 @entity103 , 29 % of the state 's female ex-convicts are eventually re-arrested			0
but @entity94 says that for women in its program , that rate drops to 3 %			1
" no woman comes out of prison and says ' @entity109 , i really want to mess up again , ' " said @entity54 , 65			1
" you talk with these women ... about the skills that they need and the perspective and the possibilities of change			1
that 's the key here : that change can happen			0
" do you know a hero ? nominations for 2012 heroes close august 31 @entity5 admits she initially had little faith that @entity27 would live up to its promise to meet her upon her release from @entity128 in @entity1			1
but the organization picked up her and her baby and brought them to one of its transitional homes in @entity135			0
" from the moment i walked through the doors , it was like home , " @entity5 said			0
" i knew i was going to be ok from that point on			0
... " if i had n't found this organization ... my family would have taken my baby			1
... i 'd be dead , in prison , smoking crack or doing heroin			0
" in @entity135 , the group maintains several affordable , sober - living transitional homes as well as permanent homes and offices			0
@entity27 also offers affordable day - care and after - school programs , a food pantry , a community garden , thrift stores and a salon -- all of which are open to the general public			0
these opportunities can mean a great deal , because women leaving prison have limited options			1
reuniting with children who 've been in foster care can be contingent upon the mother finding income and a stable home , but some ex-offenders are n't eligible for public housing in @entity1			1
and offenders on state work - release programs have eight weeks to find work			1
" employment and housing can be daunting because so many doors are closed to our mothers , " @entity54 said			1
" we all know who they are , so they do n't have to defend the fact that they have been in prison			2
women without that help , going out there on their own , have a huge challenge			2
" @entity54 knew nothing about the prison population in 1985 , when a fellow nun asked her to escort a young child to @entity128 so she could visit her mother			1
witnessing the consequences of the forced separation on the child , mother and family moved @entity54 to rededicate her life to repairing and strengthening broken bonds			1
she and four other nuns began taking in children who were born behind bars and raising them until their mothers ' release			1
this work continues today , with children regularly placed with @entity27 community members who coordinate regular visitations with moms inside			0
each visit an inmate receives offers her greater incentive to make a change			0
" little steps matter , " @entity54 said			1
" they sit in prison , and they can hardly imagine how to get from here to there			0
" nothing happens in isolation			0
when you come out and you have a community of support that encourages you to use your time well to make little steps that turn into big steps , you see the hope there			1
... they show each other they can do it			0
" women applying for housing are required to enroll in the group 's employment and training program			2
they must also be willing to comply with sober and communal living restrictions and responsibilities			0
they 're welcome for as long as they feel they need support and continue to progress			2
some have stayed for a few months , others as long as 15 years			2
" we welcome people in , " @entity54 said			1
" when they are here and it 's clear they are not using the services and progressing , then you can say to them : ' we invited you			0
if you 're not utilizing what we offer , you have to move on			0
' we hold them to their commitment			0
" the group functions on private donations and small grants and says that more than 60 % of its staffers , including @entity5 , have come through the program themselves			0
@entity5 runs the group 's youth mentoring program			0
she says that thanks to @entity54 , she 's proud of who she is today			1
" i want people to admire me , and i want to help people the way she 's helped me , " @entity5 said			0
" if i could know i 'd change a life like she changed mine , it gives purpose to the years i ran the streets			2
... it makes it all understandable then			0
because @entity282 put me through it for a reason			0
" that 's precisely the dignified spirit that @entity54 says carries this population forward			1
" they admit to their mistakes , and i admire that because i know a lot of people on the outside who do n't , " she said			2
" but they want to move beyond the mistake			0
and they want to rise up almost from the ashes and say : ' wow ! look at me			0
' " want to get involved ? check out the @entity27 website at www.hourchildren.org and see how to help .			0

for 25 years , sister @entity34 has been reaching out to mothers behind bars
