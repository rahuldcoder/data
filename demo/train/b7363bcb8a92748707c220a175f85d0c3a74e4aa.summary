@entity0 -- eight weeks after the massacre of 20 @entity8 first - graders , a ban on the kind of semi-automatic rifle used by the killer remains elusive -- if not impossible			2
such a ban became a rallying cry for victims ' families , advocacy groups and politicians supporting tougher gun laws in the emotional aftermath of the @entity18 shootings in december			1
president @entity19 still calls for updating a 1994 assault weapons ban that expired 10 years later as part of his package of steps intended to reduce chronic gun violence in @entity26 , especially in major cities			1
however , fierce opposition by the powerful @entity29 and millions of @entity26 gun owners has shifted debate away from prohibiting specific weapons to making it harder for criminals , terrorists and the mentally ill to obtain guns			1
along with a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons , @entity19 also wants to limit magazine clips to 10 rounds , expand background checks to all gun sales , crack down on gun trafficking , and strengthen efforts to prevent firearms from falling into the wrong hands			1
the multi-faceted proposal provided @entity48 with options on legislation , enhancing chances of passing some provisions , said @entity53 , director of social policy and politics at @entity56 , a @entity0 think tank that proposes policy compromises on major issues			2
gun violence plans : what 's in the works while her group supports a renewed ban on military style weapons , @entity53 said " political reality " dictated a different approach			1
" keeping guns out of the wrong hands is not only more politically palatable but also more effective to stop gun violence , " she explained			2
that strategy reflects " an understanding of gun crime in the country , " she added			0
opinion polls back up her assertion			0
a @entity78 survey released thursday showed that 92 % of respondents support expanding background checks to all gun sales			1
in households with guns , support was 91 %			0
however , a majority of households with guns opposed a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons , while the full survey showed 56 % of respondents backed the provision			2
the poll also found that 46 % of respondents believe the @entity29 better reflects their views on guns , compared to 43 % for @entity19			1
@entity18 calls on @entity8 to ' show @entity26 the way ' on gun control diverse views in @entity26 @entity19 acknowledged on thursday that @entity26 have diverse views on the issue , depending on where they grew up and how they live			1
" there are different realities and we have to respect them , " he told @entity102 at their policy retreat , noting rural hunters and urban dwellers come from distinct gun cultures			2
at the same time , the president called for action , saying " there are commonsense steps we can take and build a consensus around , and we can not shy away from taking them			0
" earlier this week , @entity117 spokesman @entity116 made clear that the goal was progress on reducing gun violence , rather than any specific provision			0
@entity116 called proposals backed by legislators from both parties " the first progress we 've seen in many , many years dealing with gun violence			0
" but none of the measures he mentioned -- expanded background checks , cracking down on gun trafficking , criminalizing " straw " purchases in which legal buyers obtain weapons for those unable to do so -- included a new ban on semi-automatic weapons			1
gun debate : where is the middle ground ? @entity29 president @entity142 said he expected few substantive changes in law because " people are smarter than politicians , " which means " common sense ultimately prevails			1
" " they hope that they can use emotion to achieve an anti-firearms agenda that they have n't been able to achieve in the past , " @entity142 told a recent @entity150 breakfast event			0
" i am convinced that as these things are discussed , that we 're going to come out about where we have come out in the past , " he added			0
his organization keeps a scorecard for each @entity0 legislator on gun issues , and spends millions on campaign contributions to favored candidates			0
in the nearly two months since the @entity18 shootings , @entity19 and the @entity117 have sought to maintain public attention on the issue			1
loaded language poisons gun debate vice president @entity171 will take part in a roundtable discussion on gun violence on monday in @entity175			2
four days later , @entity19 will award the @entity176 -- the nation 's second - highest civiian honor -- posthumously to the six educators killed with the 20 first - graders at @entity181			1
in @entity48 , some influential democrats join virtually all @entity183 in opposing , or at least questioning , a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons like the @entity188 - style rifle used in the @entity18 shootings			1
senate majority leader @entity189 , who gets high marks from the @entity29 for his opposition to past gun control efforts , has indicated support for expanding background checks but refuses to endorse a new weapons ban			1
according to @entity189 , a bill from the @entity197 was unlikely to include an updated weapons ban , but he would allow a vote on the provision during floor debate			1
weapons like the @entity203 mimic the appearance and some features of fully automatic military rifles , though they technically do not meet the definition of an assault weapon because they are semi-automatic -- meaning each shot requires a trigger pull			0
supporters of a ban say such weapons have no place in the general public because they are designed solely for rapid - fire killing capacity , rather than hunting or sport shooting			2
opinion : nothing stops a bullet like a job right to bear arms the @entity29 and other opponents contend that any limit on private gun ownership violates the constitutional right to bear arms			2
even partial steps in that direction , such as prohibiting specific models , are considered a path to potential confiscation or other future elimination of @entity236 rights , they argue			0
in recent decades , the @entity29 has led lobbying efforts that shifted the discussion away from stronger gun controls -- such as an outright ban on handguns and a national registration of gun ownership pushed by top @entity102 in the 1980s and 90s -- to the incremental measures under consideration now			1
@entity53 of @entity56 noted examples of the @entity29 's influence in the last significant gun legislation -- the @entity250 of 1993 that required background checks on guns purchased from licensed dealers , followed by the limited assault weapons ban a year later			1
while the @entity250 led to the background check system in use today , the @entity29 made sure it did n't apply to private sales , such as those at gun shows , she said			1
how the violent mentally ill can buy guns @entity19 and other @entity102 now want to close what they call a loophole to make background checks a requirement for any gun sale			1
the issue gained prominence after the @entity270 in 1999 in which three guns used by the two underage killers had been purchased by 18 - year - old @entity273 at a @entity275 gun show to avoid a background check			2
@entity277 later told a @entity279 committee that the gun purchases had been " too easy			0
" " i wish it had been more difficult , " she said			0
" i would n't have helped them buy the guns if i had faced a background check			0
" the 1994 weapons ban targeting military style weapons was gone 10 years later , when @entity48 let it expire in the administration of president @entity289 -- an outcome sought by the @entity29			1
@entity142 and other @entity29 officials argue the ban failed to reduce gun violence because it targeted firearms used in only a fraction of the nation 's gun violence			1
they also contend the government is n't properly enforcing the background checks created by @entity250 , making an expansion illogical			2
" we are not willing to support measures we feel unduly burden innocent and law - abiding @entity26 , and on the other side do not have any real impact on the problem we 're trying to solve , " @entity142 said			0
to @entity53 , the goal is to get laws on the books that make it harder for criminals , terrorists and the mentally ill to obtain guns -- either through private sales or from traffickers through straw purchases			0
minor exceptions would apply to family members giving guns to each other , or people borrowing guns on a hunting ground , she said			0
" how are they going to stop somebody who 's a gun trafficker if there 's no federal law against that now , " she wondered			0
january 's @entity333 gun background checks are second - highest limits on magazine rounds a tougher issue involves proposed limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds , she said			1
larger capacity magazines allow semi-automatic weapons to fire dozens of rounds in seconds			0
at a @entity197 hearing on gun control last week , @entity345 argued that the proposed limit could have prevented the death of a young girl in the @entity352 , @entity353 , attack that seriously wounded his wife -- former rep. @entity356			0
according to @entity345 , the 13th shot fired killed 9 - year - old @entity358 , and the shooter got tackled when trying to reload			0
with a 10 - round limit , @entity361 might still be alive , he said			0
@entity363 and @entity345 : the new ' @entity364 ' of gun control the @entity29 and its supporters say larger - capacity magazines are popular , with millions already in the possession of @entity26 gun owners who want them to feel secure against criminals armed with similar firepower			2
they also contend citizens have the right to such weaponry to protect against future government tyranny , which they say was the intent of the @entity236 's right to bear arms			0
@entity53 rejected any inference by the @entity29 or its supporters that @entity19 's proposals or other measures being discussed in @entity48 amount to taking away people 's guns			1
she praised the president 's strategy of presenting a broad package for @entity48 to consider , saying : " it behooves people who are working on this issue to keep the @entity29 arguing about lots of different issues , rather than allowing it to concentrate on one and defeat it			2
" @entity399 sings praises of gun ownership @entity1 's @entity402 contributed to this report .			0
