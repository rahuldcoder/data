@entity4 doctors prescribed thalidomide for expectant mothers from 1958 to 1962 to control the symptoms of morning sickness			1
the drug , developed by a @entity24 firm , was used internationally as a sedative and hailed because overdose simply caused prolonged sleep , not death			1
thalidomide also was combined with other drugs to create medications for asthma , hypertension , and migraine , according to the @entity35 , which supports victims			0

the money will be distributed by the @entity35 , he said , and will help reduce further degeneration of their health as the victims grow older			0
" the government wishes to express its sincere regret and deep sympathy for the injury and suffering endured by all those affected when expectant mothers took the drug thalidomide between 1958 and 1961 , " @entity79 said in the @entity89			1
" we acknowledge both the physical hardship and the emotional difficulties that have faced both the children affected and their families as a result of this drug , and the challenges that many continue to endure , often on a daily basis			2
" the problems caused by the drug led the @entity4 government to review the marketing , testing , and regulation of drugs , @entity79 said			1
that included the enactment of the @entity115 , which introduced more testing for medicines prior to licensing to make sure they meet safety standards			0
the @entity121 , which was created in 1962 by the parents of thalidomide victims , said it welcomed the government 's apology			2

" for them , i think , it 's something to be very grateful for and it 's welcome			0
