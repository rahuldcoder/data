-- there 's a lot that will happen in 2013 with respect to health care , but the truth of the matter is that most of it will be in preparation for 2014			1
that 's the year the @entity10 really kicks into effect			1
here are my guesses for what to watch in 2013 : 1			0
the @entity16 expansion much of this year 's election was fought over whether @entity16 should be cut			1
now the big decision is how much @entity16 will be expanded			1
about half of the uninsured who hope for coverage under the @entity10 will do so under @entity16 , an estimated 16 million to 17 million people			1
but june 's @entity25 ruling made the expansion optional , and states get to decide if they will participate			1
at last count , 17 states have said yes , and nine have said no. the rest will need to commit in 2013			1
my guess is that most will			0
the @entity36 administration has decided to play hardball , and leaving that money on the table will be met with screams by the uninsured and providers alike			0
medicaid provider payments these are going up			0
part of the @entity10 makes medicaid payments to physicians look more like @entity49 payments			1
there is such a difference that many physicians will see fees for primary care services go up by 73 %			2
those who think @entity16 costs too much already will not			1
the health insurance exchanges in 2014 , the other half of the uninsured will need to go to the health insurance exchanges to get their insurance			1
these are tightly regulated marketplaces where individuals will be able to get community - rated insurance and ca n't be turned down even if they have chronic conditions			2
people who make between 133 % and 400 % of the federal poverty line will get subsidies in the form of tax credits to help defer the cost			0
but many states are choosing not to form local exchanges , leaving it to the federal government			1
for those states that opt for exchanges , there 's a ton of work to do next year to get them ready to go			1
the federal government will be responsible for all the states that are opting out , and it has even more work to do			1
expect a lot of news on their development			2
october 1 , 2013 , is the date they 're all supposed to go live			0
@entity49 taxes taxes are going up			0
right now , employees pay a tax of 1.45 % for @entity49 ( employers pay an equal amount )			0
starting next year , for couples making more than $ 250,000 that tax will go up by 0.9 % on income above the threshold			2
additionally , investment income will also be taxed at 3.8 % for people above the threshold			0
this is the first time that unearned income will be subject to a @entity49 tax			0
@entity49 reform this got a lot of attention in the election , and in the first few rounds of fiscal cliff negotiations			2
talk of raising the eligibility age is dead for now , and discussions of turning @entity49 into a voucher program are in the dustbin of history as well			0
i do n't think that any huge changes will happen on this front , short of those already put in place by the @entity10 and quietly re-embraced by @entity123 post-election			2
the @entity36 administration has proposed some new cuts , but almost none of those will affect 2013			0
insurance transparency a small but important benefit of the @entity10 will start in 2013			1
from now on , insurance companies are mandated to describe all plans in easy - to - understand @entity132 in a standardized format			2
here 's a sample ( @entity135 )			0
this will make things easier for many people , although insurance policies will still be hard to understand			0
health care spending although many believe that health care costs will rise more slowly in 2013 , at about 3.8 % , we will still be spending $ 2.9 trillion			1
that 's a lot of money			0
as we continue to fight over the budget deficit and the debt , expect the costs of health care to continue getting a lot of attention			1
that should account for most of the excitement next year			0
whether i 'm right or wrong , we 'll be covering it here on @entity0			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity158 .			2

@entity160 : next year will be in preparation for 2014 when @entity10 kicks in
@entity158 : most states will probably commit to participating in the @entity16 expansion
he says forming health insurance exchanges will take a lot of work to get ready
@entity158 : expect the costs of health care to continue getting a lot of attention
