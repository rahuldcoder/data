@entity2 @entity0 , july 1941			2
@entity3 , a charismatic , @entity4 art student on assignment for @entity6 , was traveling on a busy train alongside peasants and @entity10 soldiers			1
suddenly , an old women leaned over			2
" @entity14 , my brother had beautiful @entity16 shoes like yours , " she said			2
" c'est extraordinaire , " he replied , affecting nonchalance			0
luckily , none of the @entity10 soldiers overheard this conversation , and he lived to fight another day			0
and , after surviving three @entity23 prisons and five @entity25 concentration camps , he became one of the most prominent fashion illustrators of his age			1
@entity3 , of course , was not his real name			0
rather , it was a cover used by @entity32 , a @entity33 spy and talented artist who had parachuted into @entity4 the month before as part of the legendary @entity36 ( @entity36 ) , a clandestine espionage and sabotage unit			1
on landing in @entity4 , his radio transmitter had become tangled in a tree , and his first few days had been wasted trying to retrieve it without attracting attention			0
thereafter , he had gone to ground for two weeks , living on nothing but stolen peaches -- a diet which had left him with acute dysentery -- before risking the train journey to @entity49 to make contact with a spy network known as " ventriloquist "			2
@entity32 had been trained as a clandestine radio operator , and given the @entity54			1
on the train that day he was carrying a paintbox that had been specially adapted to contain a secret transmitter -- the one he had managed to rescue from the tree			0
a most dangerous mission at that time , the life expectancy of an @entity36 radio operator in occupied @entity4 was just six weeks			0
knowing that something as insignificant as a @entity33 button on his jacket could give the game away , @entity36 's @entity63 had painstakingly made @entity70 's clothes using @entity4 fabric , styles and techniques			1
but for some reason , he was still wearing @entity33 - made shoes			1
" he told the story to his sister , but she is n't sure how the mistake occurred , " says @entity77 , managing director of the @entity79 art dealer in @entity2 , who has collected @entity32 's work			1
" maybe he was wearing @entity4 shoes to start with but they got ruined , so he changed them at a safe house			0
either way , he was lucky to escape			0
" that @entity70 was nearly given away by his clothing is ironic : after the @entity89 he enjoyed a stellar career as a fashion illustrator , becoming one of the leading artists for @entity6 and @entity94			1
he even painted a portrait of @entity33 's queen mother , which hangs in the @entity97 in @entity2 to this day			1
but this was not before he had spent almost three years in captivity			0
in october 1942 , the @entity100 were able to triangulate his position during a secret transmission , and @entity32 was arrested			1
he spent the rest of the war in various prisons and camps , including in the notorious @entity108 concentration camp			1
he survived only because he was able to draw the guards ' wives and mistresses in exchange for extra food and shelter			2
from rags to riches immediately after the @entity89 , @entity32 returned to @entity108 to make sketches of the crematoria , in order to " bear witness " ( these drawings are currently held at the @entity122 in @entity2 )			1
he was also able to use his exceptional visual memory to serve his country one last time			0
officials from @entity36 were trying to find out what had happened to four of their female officers ; @entity32 was able to draw from memory four well - dressed women that he had seen being taken to their deaths by the @entity131 the year before			1
his sketches matched their photographs			0
as a result , their files were closed and their families were informed of their deaths			0
it was while @entity32 was acting as a witness at the @entity140 that he met the @entity142 socialite @entity143 , then a major in the @entity144			1
@entity145 persuaded @entity70 to move to @entity146 to join the large number of @entity89 émigré illustrators who were shaping @entity142 's fashion trends			1
with @entity145 's help , @entity70 quickly became part of the high society scene , rubbing shoulders with @entity154 and his fourth glamorous wife , the @entity157 baroness @entity156 , as well as members of @entity160 's circle			1
in 1952 , @entity161 , an editor at @entity6 , made @entity70 the first new illustrator to be taken on by the magazine since 1939			1
" in those days , there was a belief that illustration showed how the clothes should be worn better than photography , " says @entity77			0
" the magazines were split evenly between photographs and illustration			0
it was the golden age of fashion illustration			2
" @entity174 , tailor , artist , spy @entity32 died of a heart attack in 1998 , and his pictures have been brought together for the first time at @entity79 , where they can be purchased			1
they have also been collected in a new book , " @entity32 , @entity184 , 1918 - 1998 " , by @entity185 and @entity186 ( @entity187 , $ 24.95 )			1
" normally , fashion illustrations of the period were thrown away after they had been published , " says @entity77			2
" but something inside @entity191 made him keep everything			0
" six years ago , members of his family discovered a box of his pictures and brought them to a @entity198 road show in @entity199 to be evaluated			0
eventually they were auctioned , and i recognized their rarity and purchased them			0
" since then , @entity203 has become increasingly fascinated with @entity70 , becoming acquainted with his surviving family and several of his friends ( including 83 - year - old @entity156 )			2
@entity77 believes that the same qualities lay behind @entity191 's aptitude as an artist and as a spy			2
" he was a perennial outsider and an observer , " he says			0
" he was illegitimate and was brought up largely by his mother in @entity4 , and never became part of mainstream society			0
" but despite these challenges , he had shown the inner strength to remain balanced in the face of adversity			0
he was incredibly handsome , charismatic and well - liked , and throughout his life , people noticed him -- from his commanding officer to the editor of @entity6			2
" that is what must have caught the attention of @entity33 spy masters			1
" behind the scenes at the legendary @entity229 unseen photos of @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 and others lethal beauty in the @entity236 : @entity238 's rare bejeweled show guns			0

@entity32 was a @entity33 spy in @entity89
he was arrested in 1942 and survived three prisons and five concentration camps
@entity70 later *emigrated* to @entity142 and became a top fashion illustrator for @entity6 magazine
