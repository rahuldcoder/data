the jolt created by @entity5 ' invasion of @entity6 could n't happen today			1
we 're just too connected			2
in today 's world , the @entity5 's frenzied @entity9 and @entity10 concerts would be all over @entity12			1
@entity13 would be abuzz about this new group with the funny hair and the screaming fans			2
countless cell phones would be raised in glory at their every move			2
there would be no element of surprise , no sense of unveiling			2
but 50 years ago , it was revelatory			2
5 things to know about @entity28 on february 9 , 1964 , @entity5 made their @entity6 debut on " the @entity30			1
" @entity31 was a sunday night staple , one of the great variety shows , a tv version of vaudeville with comedians , acrobats and song - and - dance acts			1
into this staid carnival came four fresh - faced englishmen with their hair and guitars			1
@entity6 had heard their music in the first few weeks of 1964 -- " @entity55 " was already the no. 1 song in the country and other @entity5 numbers were making their way up the charts -- but @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 were essentially unknown , two - dimensional photos at best			1
the @entity31 appearance kicked off the @entity6 strain of @entity28 , a fever that had already infected their native @entity59			2
it would last for years , morphing along with the band as they performed in stadiums , retreated to the studio , experimented with drugs , married , divorced , bickered and eventually broke up			2
the @entity5 of myth , @entity5 of reality now , a half - century later , @entity5 are back -- and @entity28 has struck again			1
@entity68 is airing a special devoted to the group			2
@entity71 , @entity5 ' label , is re-releasing the band 's 13 @entity6 albums			1
@entity75 is airing " the @entity76 , " a look back at the musical revolution the band spawned			1
it 's co-produced by @entity81 , who expertly recreated the time in his 1996 film " @entity83 ! " everybody with a memory -- not least @entity51 and @entity53 , the surviving members of @entity5 -- is making the rounds			1
at the @entity88 on sunday night , @entity51 and @entity53 reunited for a song and were frequently singled out by presenters			2
@entity91 and @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity95 's respective widows , presented the album of the year award			2
the audience , invariably , cheered			2
in many ways , the @entity31 appearance marked the beginning of a cultural revolution			1
the @entity103 ' @entity102 perhaps said it best on the @entity88 red carpet			2
" @entity5 , " he observed , " are the foundation of everything we do			1
" ' it was an unreal situation ' but first came the hair , the girls , the screaming			2
" it began with shrieks , sirens and total panic , " wrote @entity112 in @entity113 of their arrival at @entity117 's @entity116 -- renamed just weeks earlier for the fallen president -- rarely failing to mention a " mop of hair " or " beatle haircut			2
" visually , they are a nightmare : tight , dandified @entity130 beatnik suits and great pudding bowls of hair , " the magazine wrote			2
the hair , to a postwar world used to crew cuts and short back - and - sides , was novel			1
reporters asked to touch it			2
fan clubs gave away snippets , like pieces of the @entity142			2
but the screams ? they had screamed before -- for @entity145 , for @entity146 , for @entity147 -- and they would scream again			0
but they had never screamed like this			0
the scene at @entity116 , the crowds around @entity117 's @entity154 , the jet - engine squeals inside @entity68 ' @entity156 for the debut appearance on " the @entity30 " -- they were , literally , unheard - of			1
" i did ( cue ) cards for @entity147 , and i remember kids yelling			0
but nothing close to what happened ( then )			0
you ca n't compare the two , " says @entity163 , at the time a 29 - year - old production assistant for @entity31			1
" it was an unreal situation			0
" did you get swept up in @entity28 ? share your memories here the @entity5 were like aliens dropped into the @entity6 of 1964			1
@entity172 's assassination 10 weeks earlier had left a gloom on the land			0
together , the two events created a dividing line between @entity177			0
" a lot of people do n't understand why ( @entity31 ) was a seminal moment in the history of @entity6 and , for that matter , the history of the world , " former @entity179 governor and presidential candidate @entity178 recalled in a recent speech			0
" the country had just gone through a very painful time of mourning			1
... there was an extraordinary amount of despair , heartbreak , disappointment , " he continued			0
" i think people forget that we were still grieving as a nation			0
" @entity5 brought something to @entity6 more than music			1
" as former @entity205 editor @entity204 told @entity75 's @entity206 this week : " they were a novelty			0
and they were so good and they were so charming and they were so cute			0
" at the time , though , only the true insiders -- visitors to @entity59 , @entity31 's scouts , international correspondents -- knew what to expect			1
they knew that something was happening , but even they did n't know just what it was			0
' you could buy this stuff ? ' the @entity6 was a different country			0
it 's somehow appropriate that @entity5 ' appearance was in black - and - white			1
the mod , colorful ' 60s were partly a result of their handiwork			0
" when we got here , you were all walking around in f * * kin ' bermuda shorts , with @entity231 crew cuts and stuff on your teeth , " recalled @entity93 in 1970			0
" we just thought , ' what an ugly race			0
' " the effect was immediate -- and overwhelming			0
in a country of 192 million , more than 73 million people saw @entity5 on @entity31 -- a record for an entertainment program and an incredible figure even in a three - network era , when 25 million viewers was a good performance			1
other shows would surpass it -- " who shot @entity248 " on " @entity249 , " the finale of " @entity251 " -- but in our fragmented cable - and - internet world , only the @entity252 gets bigger audiences nowadays			1
the @entity5 also helped revive rock ' n ' roll			1
yes , @entity258 and surf music and girl - group pop were making inroads , but in their retooling of @entity263 riffs , r&b grooves and @entity266 harmonies , @entity5 carried it to another level			1
" back at the radio i caught ' @entity271 ' and was instantly convinced it was the most exciting rock ' n ' roll i 'd ever heard , " rock critic @entity273 , then a @entity275 college student , wrote in " the @entity276			0
" when a friend showed him the freshly purchased single , he was agog			0
" you could buy this stuff ? " he asked			0
back to @entity5 buy it they did			1
the @entity5 dominated the charts			1
they had been booked on three straight @entity31 shows ; the second one , broadcast from @entity285 , had ratings almost as high as the first			0
by april 4 , they had all five of @entity290 's top five singles			0
the next week , they had 14 songs in the top 100			0
both are records likely never to be broken			0
indeed , so much of what @entity5 did is now unassailable			1
radio stations are n't as wide open as they were back then ; nobody would ever program so many songs by the same artist			1
the @entity300 charts seem to change hour by hour , so trends are washed away within days			0
music has splintered into countless microgenres			0
so much of popular music -- both the business and the artistic inventiveness -- can be traced to @entity5			1
if they 're back , they 've never really gone away			0
three years ago , the group 's 1969 album " @entity309 " was the best - selling vinyl album of the year			1
thirteen years ago , the greatest - hits package " 1 " was the no. 1 album in the country , wrapping up an eight - week stint at the top			1
almost 20 years ago , all three of the " anthology " volumes went to no. 1			0
the @entity5 are part of our cultural dna			1
the hair ? it 's now the norm			0
the squeals are dedicated to the boy band du jour			0
in february 1964 , though , who could know what the future would bring ? not even @entity5 imagined becoming household names			1
and most observers -- besides the cheering fans -- could only see another fad , there to entertain the masses and make way for the next one			0
" the only thing that 's different is the hair , as far as i can see , " @entity336 , @entity31 's musical director , told a reporter			0
" i give them a year			0

50th *anniversary* of @entity5 on " @entity30 " is february 9
event was most - watched entertainment program of its time
@entity5 ' performance helped kick off cultural revolution
