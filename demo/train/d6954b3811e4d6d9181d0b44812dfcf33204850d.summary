-- " it 's a woman 's world , " @entity1 contributing editor @entity0 said as he prepared an installation of little black dresses for a new exhibit at the @entity5			1
men do n't commonly wear little black dresses , which is why @entity0 asked some of his favorite female designers -- plus @entity13 , himself known for slipping into a tiny black number -- to help define this iconic piece of clothing in the exhibit 's accompanying catalog			1

but as a @entity5 trustee and now curator of a museum exhibit consisting entirely of black dresses , @entity0 is inarguably an expert on the matter , too			1
the 81 dresses in his collection represent the glamorous and the practical , the revealing and the forgiving			1
the exhibit opened september 28 and will remain on display through january 27			2
little black dresses , as designer @entity42 puts it in the exhibit 's catalog , " take us to parties , job interviews , weddings and funerals			1
we experience all of life 's big events in the little black dress			1
it can be respectful or empowering , depending upon the design			0
" read more : how to dress for any occasion for @entity0 , the dresses represent the evolution of design , the achievement of world - class artists , glamour , even bravery			1
but perhaps just as striking as the elegance of these dresses is the fondness and pride with which @entity0 views them			1
many of his friends either wore or designed the pieces in his exhibit , and in some cases , as with @entity69 and @entity70 , it 's both			2
@entity0 believes that the woman wearing a little black dress can give it special meaning			1
" wearing clothes should be a personal narrative of emotion			0
i always respond to fashion in an emotional way , " @entity0 said			2
" i was sitting in @entity82 's store at @entity84 's @entity83 last year , " he said , " and @entity86 was the first celebrity to breeze into the store			2
" what stood out to @entity0 even more than his friend 's fluid leather @entity90 skirt or the embellished bodice was the fact that @entity95 wore white pony - skin stilettos with the ensemble			2

" the late @entity103 says you can never wear white shoes after @entity106			0
but of course , in today 's world , that does not exist			0
and there was @entity86 with white shoes , with a black dress , after @entity106			1
and i just said , you know , this is the example of how fashion goes forward			0
" designer @entity118 's black strapless wool cocktail - length dress , with a kick pleat in the back of @entity121 , which she wore with black gloves , surprised @entity0 as well			1
" i was at the @entity125 the year she wore this dress , and she came up the carpet with @entity130 , and i thought , ' mmm , this is a @entity131 dress			0
' and i was talking to @entity70 about another dress in the exhibit , and i said , ' oh , do you remember you wore that fabulous @entity131 dress to the @entity125 ? and i thought it was so elegant ; i 'm sure you picked out the dress for @entity138 and you decided to wear it yourself ! ' that was not the case			2
she had designed the dress the night before , " he said			0

" @entity69 , not only is she a designer , she is a mother of four , and she lives for practicality			0
she understands what a woman needs to wear to work and what a woman needs to wear when it 's time to go out and put on the @entity161 ! " not least , a little black dress allows the wearer to accentuate her physical gifts , @entity0 said , like supermodel @entity165 in a satin @entity167 dress			1
" the thermometer of @entity165 , in a satin peplum dress , looking every bit as aristocrat as a royal @entity174 duchess or princess , is amazing to me , " he said			0
" you know , it just does n't get any better than that			0
you see the way the person is wearing the dress , and you see the inherited quality of the design of the dress			0
" read more : look fashionable for less @entity187 , of @entity188 , achieved that coup , @entity0 said , when designer @entity13 wore her black lace shirt dress with nothing but white boxer shorts underneath			1
the daring look opened the doors to the possibilities of men 's fashion			0
" i think , in today 's @entity198 , there is a great leverage and a great sense of liberation " in men 's fashion , @entity0 said			2
" and i chose this dress with great care			0
i was there when @entity13 wore it ; it was a very shock value moment , " but it was also a statement of elegance and confidence by a provocative designer			0
" there is room in today 's world for men to wear dresses , " @entity0 said			1
" i 've seen students on this campus going to classes wearing the most extraordinary kilts i 've ever seen			0
" @entity0 learned the students were wearing kilts that construction workers wear to hold their tools			2
" but it 's really a skirt ! " he said			0
@entity0 believes that if men are willing to put on utility kilts , sooner or later they 'll be putting on black lace dresses , like his friend @entity13			1
he said so in all seriousness			0
" this was not a frivolous moment here			0
this was not a moment of slap - dash			0
this was a moment where he knew what he was doing , was going to send signals around the world that you can , in fact , if you want to , wear a lace dress			0
if you want to go to the gym and spend hours buffing your body , if you want to be glamorized to the hilt with a lace dress and go to a show party dressed like this , it 's fine , " @entity0 said			1
