@entity0 , @entity1 -- a 19 - year - old prostitute working in an apartment that doubles as a brothel said she has up to eight clients a day			2
a woman awaits customers at a @entity0 barber shop in 2008			0
sex workers also ply their trade in barber shops			1
working in the southern boom city of @entity15 , a special economic zone just north of @entity17 , she told @entity2 she worries about getting @entity18 , but has her own prevention measures			0
" i always use condoms or take an injection			0
the medicine can prevent sexually transmitted diseases , " she said			0
" some girls do not use prevention measures , but we do n't talk about that in public			0
" this young woman , who would not give her name , is part of a group that @entity1 and international health authorities are concerned could potentially spread @entity34 and @entity18 in the world 's most populated country , so officials have stepped up efforts to educate them about the virus and dispel misconceptions about so - called " injections " that can prevent infection			1
" i think sex work is probably one of the most important factors for the potential of @entity34 spreading in @entity47 and also in @entity1			1
there is no doubt about it , " said @entity48 , @entity49			0
" one of the things that we have seen in @entity1 is that knowledge about @entity18 is very low in the general population and certainly also in the sex work industry			1
that is a big , big problem , " @entity48 said			0
it is estimated that some 700,000 people are living with @entity34 in @entity1 and there are about 50,000 new infections every year , according to the @entity1 government and @entity49			1
the @entity67 agency believes a significant number of those new infections include sex workers			1
prostitution is officially illegal in @entity1 , but very loosely addressed by the government			2
it is estimated that there are between two and four million sex workers in @entity1			1
as the country 's economy has boomed , so has the sex industry , especially in prosperous cities like @entity15			1
many clients flock there from @entity17 which is just an hour away , some of them businessmen with money to spend			0
condom use in @entity1 can range anywhere from about 20 percent to 80 percent , according to @entity49			2
people think that they can avoid hiv infections by taking a pill			2
people think that they are not at risk for @entity34 infections because they do n't know anybody ( who has it ) , because you ca n't see it , you ca n't touch it			1
and clearly , this is something that we have to change very rapidly , " @entity48 said			0
historically , @entity34 and @entity18 have been taboo topics in @entity1 , another reason awareness can be so low			1
prevention in the gay community has also been difficult because of traditional stigmas against homosexuality			0
but the @entity1 government is now conducting educational campaigns to inform higher risk groups , including sex workers , about how to prevent the transmission of @entity34			1
" after years of these campaigns , we found out through survey that condom use is constantly increasing , especially in urban areas , the condom use can reach 70 percent or even up to 80 percent , " said @entity119 , deputy bureau chief of the @entity121 's @entity120			0
but other areas are proving difficult			0
in rural parts of the country , the proportion of condom use among sex workers is less than 50 percent , @entity119 said			1
" when we go to investigate in rural areas , the proportion of people with this knowledge ( of aids prevention ) is still very low , " he said			0
" in addition to that , the proportion of change in their activities is also very low , which means that the condom use rate is still low			0
" about one in 200 sex workers nationwide currently has @entity34 , @entity48 said			1
but in one part of @entity145 province in the country 's far southwest , seven percent of the sex workers -- or as many as 14 in every 200 -- have @entity34 , according to @entity49			1
" the sex workers living in remote areas and rural areas have played an important role in @entity18 spreading			1
we do not have a precise figure for the proportion that sex workers make up in it ( the spread of @entity18 ) , but we can say that they are making up a significant proportion , " @entity119 said			1
the government has a long - term plan to educate the general public and to strengthen intervention in the high - risk populations , particularly sex workers , @entity119 said			2
when @entity34 initially began to spread in @entity1 , infections were concentrated among people who injected drugs , @entity48 said			1
campaigns among this group have been effective , while infections among other groups have risen			0
one of those groups , @entity119 said , was men having sex with men , which accounts for 5.9 percent of infections , according to the @entity121			2
a majority of the infections are concentrated among drug users , men having sex with men , and sex workers and their clients , @entity48 said			1
" society and communities have been able to curb the spread of @entity34 , also in sex work , and that is what we have to do , " @entity48 said			2
as @entity1 's economy grows , it is likely the sex industry will as well			1
current estimates show that some 30 to 50 million people are at significant risk for @entity34 infection , @entity48 said			2
" @entity1 is a society which is in quite a significant transition			2
there is a huge increase in disparity of income between the rich and the poor , and all these are very well - known factors that drive the sex industry forward , " @entity48 said			2
" clearly , in @entity1 , i think that the sex industry is a rising industry			1
we will see an increase in the number of sex workers due to these factors in the future			2
" a 22 - year - old prostitute in @entity15 , who did not want to give her name , said she knows the risk but needs the work			0
" @entity18 is the number one killer for my job			0
i can not let this disease destroy my life			0
this is only a short - term business			0
i do n't have any relatives in @entity15 and ca n't borrow any money			0
i can only rely on myself			0

some people in @entity1 believe injections or a pill can prevent infection
some 700,000 people have @entity34 in @entity1 ; about 50,000 new infections yearly
about one in 200 sex workers nationwide currently has @entity34
as @entity1 's economy has boomed , so has the sex industry
