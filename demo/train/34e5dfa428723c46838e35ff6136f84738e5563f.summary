-- invisible children , which produced a hugely popular half - hour documentary about notorious @entity4 warlord @entity3 , released a new video monday to try to address criticisms about its nonprofit organization , its approach and its goals			1
the group 's " @entity12 " video had been viewed more than 74 million times on @entity14 by monday			1
invisible children , which is based in @entity16 , said it hopes the film and other efforts will make @entity3 a household name and drum up international support to halt killings , rapes , abuses and abductions committed by his group the @entity27 , or @entity27 , in @entity28			1
the 30 - minute video became a sensation thanks to thousands of posts on @entity32 and @entity33 , including from celebrities including @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39			1
but in dramatically introducing @entity3 to many for the first time , the video also spurred a flurry of questions about @entity15 's intentions , its transparency and whether the social - media frenzy was too little , too late			1
" i understand why a lot of people are wondering is this some slick , kind of fly - by - night , slacktivist thing , when actually it 's not at all , " said @entity15 ceo @entity48 on the 8 minute , 32 second video released monday			1
" it 's connected to a really deep , thoughtful , very intentional and strategic campaign			1
" @entity3 has operated in @entity28 for two decades and is wanted for crimes against humanity by the @entity60			2
in october , the @entity61 sent 100 combat - equipped troops on a mission to kill or capture @entity3			2
@entity64 , who spent three harrowing years in captivity after the @entity27 abducted her in 2001 , said last week that she agreed that @entity3 needs to face justice and she hoped the documentary would help make that happen			2
but she said she worried that a military campaign against @entity3 might bring more injury to children who have suffered enough			1
@entity64 was severely disfigured after a military bombing targeting the @entity27			0
" they should open their eyes more on the people affected by the war , " she said of @entity15			0
" and the children -- they need to find a way to protect them			1
they have no hope , no way to escape			0
" @entity48 said on sunday that @entity15 was acutely aware of those risks			0
" any approach to stop the @entity27 needs to be sensitive to that , " he said			0
" it needs to do everything possible to protect those innocent women and children			1
" and again , on the video released monday , @entity48 said that while most agree that @entity3 needs to be stopped , how to accomplish that is far more complicated			1
" that 's not that easy			1
it 's actually really difficult , " @entity48 said			2
" therefore , the effort to stop the @entity27 has to be comprehensive , and it has to be huge			0
" @entity48 did not directly address criticisms from several observers , who have urged caution and said @entity15 has manipulated facts in the past			0
a student blog called " @entity99 " linked to a photograph of @entity15 's founders -- @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 -- posing with hard - core weaponry with members of the @entity107 , who have battled the @entity27			2
" the group is in favor of direct military intervention , and their money supports the @entity115 government 's army and various other military forces , " the @entity99 blog post said			2
" both the @entity115 army and @entity107 are riddled with accusations of rape and looting , but @entity15 defends them			2
" in monday 's video , there was no mention of arming any one group			1
@entity48 said only that " our goal has always been the same ... to stop the violence of the @entity27 permanently			0
" @entity48 added that a large mass advocacy campaign , that ideally would spur public pressure on government leaders worldwide to act in some way , was one pillar of @entity15 's three - pronged approach			1
the other two were producing media , such as the films , and funding development programs to directly help people in @entity28			0
@entity48 was particularly adamant in defending his organization against criticisms it had not been open about its finances			1
" any claims that we do not have financial transparency or that we 're not audited every year by an independent firm or that we do n't have financial integrity just are n't true , " @entity48 said			1
on its website , @entity15 said it spent 80.46 % on programs in 2011 , 16.24 % on administration and management costs and 3.22 % on direct fundraising			0
@entity48 also noted that " audited financial statements , tax returns and our annual report " are all online			2
invisible children spokeswoman @entity157 has said money generated from the film will go to help build schools in @entity115			1
money will also go to support a high - frequency radio station that @entity15 operates , which broadcasts @entity164 messages to fighters urging them to defect			0
@entity0 was unable immediately to verify this information or any of @entity15 's activities in @entity4 nations			1
@entity48 defended some line items that have drawn scrutiny in recent days			0
they include " travel and transportation expenses " related to staging 3,000 free screenings annually of the group 's films at high schools and colleges , as well as production costs to create items like dvds and t - shirts " that fund all of our work			2
" @entity104 , the video 's director , on sunday told @entity0 that @entity15 had chosen @entity3 as a focal point to get its larger message out about ending violence and promoting peace in the region			1
because of the zeitgeist of the culture and the world , we need an enemy , " he said			0
" we need to know who the worst is			0
" on april 20 , the group plans to paper cities with @entity3 posters			0
but the media attention on @entity3 may actually hamper efforts to catch @entity3 , said @entity203 of the @entity204 , a @entity206 think tank			0
the film comes after a regional -- and covert -- military operation that has been under way for several months			0
the attention could prompt @entity3 to go on the move again and may set back @entity4 and @entity61 efforts to catch the warlord			1
" all i can say is , it could n't have happened at a more unhelpful moment when you look at it strategically and operationally , " said @entity203 , a civilian adviser to the military command that sent the @entity61 troops			2
@entity0 's @entity220 spoke with @entity221 , a @entity115 featured in the video			1
@entity223 returned with @entity221 for exclusive access to go to the exact spot where he says @entity27 rebels took him in the middle of the night years ago			0
@entity221 was able to escape a few days later , saying his life would be very different if he had n't			2
" i reached a point when i said , ' i can even die now ' because i thought it would be the immediate resolution of my suffering , " @entity221 said			0
the @entity115 called criticism against the documentary unfair			0
" the same thing that was happening here is going on in other parts of the country , " @entity221 said			0
" i feel like it is not good for a human being , for any other child , for any other village to be suffering , " he said			0
while millions around the world have viewed the first documentary , many people in remote areas of @entity115 have n't been able to see it because they do n't have access to the @entity250 or a television			1
the @entity252 said it will have a community screening of " @entity12 " on tuesday in northern @entity115			1
organizers have said their purpose is to help victims of war			0
the @entity27 terrorized @entity115 for years in a failed attempt to overthrow the government			0
but since 2006 , when it was pushed out of northern @entity115 , it has largely operated in the @entity260 and @entity261			0
the @entity263 refugee agency said last week that 3,000 people were recently displaced after fresh @entity27 attacks in @entity260 's @entity266			2
the agency reported 20 new attacks since the start of the year , with one person killed and 17 abducted			0
the cultish rebel group stands accused of using vicious tactics to recruit and force thousands of children into taking up arms			2
there are reports of child soldiers brainwashed into killing their own parents			0
actress @entity279 , a good will ambassador for @entity280 who has visited areas attacked by the @entity27 , commended invisible children for bringing " unprecedented focus " to a horrific situation but urged people to donate money to agencies like the @entity288 and @entity280 that work to help victims			1
@entity115 government spokesman @entity290 was more critical , saying @entity15 's campaign portrayed @entity28 as a dark and incessantly troubled continent			1
" invisible children , if it is using such images to dupe the international community into , into ensuring that they contribute financially into its works , i 'm afraid to say it is a wrong approach , " @entity290 said			1
" and indeed its activities in northern @entity115 will be further questioned , in as far as the amount of money they receive vis - a - vis the actual interventions that they make in northern @entity115 where he thinks he is concerned about			0
" in the video released monday , @entity48 said he understood why people might challenge @entity15 's model and strategy			1
at the same time , he vowed that his group plans to answer questions in the coming days -- urging people to tweet @ invisible , including # askicanything , so that he and others can respond			2
" we want you to know all about the next steps , so we 're going to be sending details in the coming days , " said @entity48			0
" and we want to answer any question that you have , that maybe was n't addressed in this video			1
" @entity0 's @entity220 , @entity321 and @entity322 contributed to this report .			2
