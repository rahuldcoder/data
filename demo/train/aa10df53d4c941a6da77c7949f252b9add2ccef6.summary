@entity0 denied he picked on girlfriend @entity1 , his murder trial heard thursday , as the chief prosecutor sought to portray the track star as an arrogant hothead who is reckless with guns			1
in a second day of blunt and aggressive questioning , prosecutor @entity8 accused the double amputee of blaming other people for his mistakes , as he sought to prove the @entity13 and @entity15 athlete murdered @entity1 on @entity16 last year			1
@entity17 began by picking apart message exchanges between the couple , accusing the runner of screaming at his girlfriend and acting selfishly toward her			0
" i did n't treat her badly , " @entity0 replied			1
asked if @entity1 had lied when she said he picked on her incessantly , @entity0 replied : " she never lied			1
" he later added : " @entity1 was never scared of me			1
" @entity17 highlighted an incident in which @entity1 complained in a message that @entity0 asked her to stop chewing gum			1
he also read a message in which she defended herself against @entity0 ' accusations that she flirted at a party			1
" you were strong enough in that relationship to say stop your voices , stop your accents , stop chewing gum , " @entity17 said			0
but @entity0 replied he gently told her to stop chewing gum before they got on camera at an event			1
@entity17 said @entity0 never responded to @entity1 's message in which she said , " i 'm the girl who fell in love with you			1
" " we did a search ... the phrase ' i love you ' appears twice on her phone , to her mother , " the prosecutor said			2

police capt. @entity93 gave evidence earlier in the trial , saying the weapon could fire only if the trigger was pulled			0

" now you blame counsel mr. @entity100 , " @entity17 said			0
@entity0 , the most composed he has been in days , said he repeatedly took the blame for the incident , but the prosecutor tried to poke holes in his declaration			1
you never touched the trigger , the gun went off			0
you took the blame , you took responsibility , but no one remembers , " @entity17 said			0
@entity0 also said two witnesses , an ex-girlfriend and a friend , were lying about an incident in which the runner is alleged to have fired his gun out the sunroof of a car			1
and he said he was n't guilty of a fourth charge against him : illegal possession of ammunition found in a safe in his home after @entity1 's death			2
" you just do n't want to accept responsibility for anything , " @entity17 told @entity0 , whose answers to the accusations were short denials			2
' you shot and killed her			0
say it ' a day before , a defiant @entity17 bluntly barked at the @entity13 star on the stand : " you shot and killed her			0
say it -- ' i shot and killed @entity1 , ' " no one disputes that @entity0 killed @entity1			1
but the prosecution is trying to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he did so knowingly and intentionally			0
the runner has admitted to the killing , but he said he mistook @entity1 for an intruder in the bathroom when he fired through the door and killed her			2
before @entity17 went after @entity0 , @entity100 had tossed his client a question to drive that argument home			2
he asked @entity150 if he intentionally killed @entity1			2
" i did not intend to kill @entity1 or anybody else for that matter , " he replied			2
in a dramatic opening to his cross-examination wednesday , @entity17 shocked the @entity157 court when he confronted @entity150 with a graphic photograph of @entity1 showing the side and back of her skull , her hair matted with blood			1

" i keep thinking , ' let me see how he 's taking this			0
