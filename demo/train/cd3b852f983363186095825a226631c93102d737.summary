-- businesses exist to make a profit			1
that 's why they 're businesses			2
but , in their quest to make money , there are certain invisible lines they should be careful about crossing			2
making a profit is one thing			2
going over the line and insulting your customers is another			2
it 's the kind of thing that can put a business out of business			0
almost every airline has been charging passengers to check bags for quite a while now			0
when the fees were first instituted , there was considerable grumbling , but travelers have become accustomed to it , even if they still do n't much like it			0
executives who run the airlines know that passengers will always flock to a low fare			0
that 's the primary reason the airlines began charging to check bags : operating an airline is tremendously expensive , and to keep the basic ticket price as low as possible , the revenue had to be made up somewhere			1
fees to change reservations , fees for meals , fees for early boarding , fees for pillows and blankets , fees for seats with a little extra legroom			0
. reporter @entity52 of the @entity53 recently wrote that " airlines are likely to keep looking for new ways to nickel - and - dime customers on formerly free items			1
" she quoted @entity58 , an airline industry consumer advocate , as saying that " he would n't be shocked if big carriers eventually adopted fees for carry - on luggage			1
" that 's not a typo			0
fees for carrying on bags , not checking them			0
now , that could never really happen , right ? that 's just speculation , is n't it ? but in fact , there is already precedent in the @entity76 aviation industry			0
low - cost carrier @entity78 charges its passengers a fee for their carry - on bags ; based on when and where they purchase their tickets , the fee ranges from $ 25 to $ 50 per carry - on bag			1
on its website , @entity78 says that to provide " ultra-low basic fares , " it gives its passengers " freedom to choose only the extras they value			0
" if the price wars continue to escalate , would the major airlines ever dare to tell their passengers that carrying their clothes along with them on a trip is an " extra " feature of flying for which the customers should be expected to pay an additional fee ? because that 's what the choice would come down to			1
if you buy a ticket and are told that you have to pay more to check your bags , and that if you do n't check your bags you also have to pay more to carry them with you , your only alternative , if you object , would be to leave at home any clothes except the ones you are wearing			1
that 's where the invisible line between trying to make a profit , and insulting your customers , comes in			1
more than a decade ago , @entity116 , which became @entity117 , decided that it would be a bright idea to charge customers a fee -- $ 3 -- every time those customers interacted with a teller			1
banks were already charging fees to use atms -- people getting cash from the machines were paying a convenience fee			2
but then @entity116 instituted the rule that , if customers with less than a certain amount of cash in their accounts went to a teller window , the conversation and transaction with the teller would cost them that $ 3			1
customers with whom i spoke at the time said that even when they were making deposits , they would be charged for handing over their own money			2
to some customers , that constituted robbery -- by the banks			0
there are a few things in this world , even in the world of business , that people should not be expected to pay for			0
when you walk into a bank , no matter what , dealing with a teller should be free			2
during the extensive public and media conversation over the issue , i expressed the opinion that any bank that charges any of its customers a penny to interact with a teller does n't deserve to have any customers			1
first @entity168 became @entity117 , and installed a new top man who had not made the original decision , but had inherited it			2
he was a fellow by the name of @entity176 , who has , of course , since moved on to bigger things : as chairman , president and ceo of @entity180 , @entity176 is one of the most powerful and influential financial figures in the world			0
back when he was newly at @entity117 , he called me , saying he wanted to explain the business rationale for the teller fee			1
if you should ever unexpectedly receive a phone call from @entity176 , you will immediately recognize ( at least i did ) that he is smarter than you , that he is 100 % certain that his position is the correct position , and that he is confident that he can persuade you to come around to his side			0
but , world - class persuasiveness notwithstanding , in the case of teller fees the policy was destined ultimately to fail , because it crossed that mythical line : it insulted the customers			1
two years after that conversation , @entity117 announced that it was dropping the fee			0
one of its top executives told a reporter : " why have it ? i was n't here when we started it			0
i really do n't understand why we 'd have it			0
" ( yet , as some readers already are thinking , there are banks around the country that have figured out new ways to charge for dealing in person with tellers without using the label " teller fee			1
" it usually shows up on the monthly statement , under some arcane heading			0
the desire to make that extra buck never seems to end			0
) will you eventually be paying to carry your bag onto a plane ? @entity221 has garnered a lot of good will , and a lot of business , by holding out against the movement to charge for checked bags -- @entity221 still checks the first two bags for free			1
@entity229 does n't charge for the first checked bag			1
if some major carriers announce that they are instituting a fee for carry - ons , the best counteroffensive will likely come from one or more of their competitors , who may choose to proclaim : " come fly with us			1
we do n't charge you to carry your own bag			1
" for the beleaguered traveling public , that may even sound like a victory			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity244 .			2

@entity244 : businesses exist to make profit . but would airlines stoop to charging for carry - ons ?
at least one small carrier does , he says . such a business move insults customers
he says @entity168 bank once charged $ 3 to bank with a teller . they had to drop fee
@entity244 : for *exasperated* public , " we do n't charge you to carry your bag " can seem a bargain
