@entity0 -- the @entity3 government cried foul tuesday after a @entity0 panel said it has found credible allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by both sides during the final stages of the country 's civil war			1
a government spokesman called the panel 's report " unacceptable , " while @entity3 's @entity16 said the report is " fundamentally flawed " and based on " patently biased material			1
" the @entity19 , the main @entity20 opposition party in parliament , once dubbed as a " proxy " to @entity24 rebels during the conflict , said it concurs with the findings			1
in the @entity0 report released monday , the three - member panel recommends the government of @entity3 immediately conduct an investigation into the alleged violations of international law and take other measures to " advance accountability			1
" in a statement , @entity0 @entity37 ban ki - moon 's spokesman said @entity37 " sincerely hopes that this advisory report will make a contribution to full accountability and justice so that the @entity3 government and people will be able to proceed towards national reconciliation and peace			1
" human rights groups have already alleged that both government troops and @entity24 rebels violated humanitarian laws and that thousands of civilians were killed during the war , which ended in may 2009 after the government declared victory			1
the rebels had fought a 26 - year bloody separatist war that left thousands dead and large numbers of others internally displaced , according to the @entity0			1
the @entity0 panel started investigating in september 2010 and submitted its report april 12 , the @entity0 said			1
the decision to release the report now was made in order to be transparent and serve the public interest , @entity37 's spokesman said			0
@entity3 's government " strongly rejected " the report by what it called an " illegal advisory committee			1
" in a response posted last week on the country 's official government news portal , it called the report " biased , baseless and unilateral			0
" the report focuses on the final phase of the military campaign to defeat the rebels , a phase that has been shrouded in controversy in part because local and international media were barred from access to the battle zones			1
@entity3 's government and the rebels have denied war crimes allegations			1
@entity3 president @entity84 has also said " not one civilian was shot dead " by government troops			2
the panel , however , said its findings reveal " a very different version " of events than that maintained by the government			2
it said it found " credible allegations , which if proven , indicate that a wide range of serious violations of international humanitarian law and international humanitarian rights law was committed both by the government of @entity3 and the @entity24 ( rebels ) , some of which would amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity			1
" in the war 's final stage , which lasted from september 2008 to may 2009 , the @entity3 army advanced into an area of northern @entity3 known as the @entity111 , where about 330,000 people were trapped by fighting			1
the report said the government used " large - scale and widespread shelling " that left large numbers of civilians dead			0
some of the shelling happened in no - fire zones where the government had encouraged civilians to congregate , the report said			0
government forces also shelled a @entity0 hub , food distribution lines and near ships belonging to the @entity130 that were picking up the wounded and their relatives from beaches , the report said			1
the government also shelled hospitals on the front lines , some of them repeatedly , the report said			0
" most civilian casualties in the final phases of the war were caused by government shelling , " it said			2
while government forces screened civilians for suspected rebels , some civilians were summarily executed and some of the women may have been raped , the report said			2
others disappeared , and some of those detained in camps were tortured , it added			0
the rebels , meanwhile , used civilians as hostages or human shields during the fighting , the report found			0
@entity24 rebels also used forced recruitment -- including of children as young as 14 -- and forced civilians to dig trenches and other military positions , blurring the distinction between combatants and civilians and exposing the latter to further harm , it said			0
starting in february 2009 , the rebels also started " point - blank shooting of civilians " who tried to flee the conflict zone , the report found			2
" i pray to @entity181 every day to give strength and courage to the secretary general of the @entity0 , for him to do the right thing for the sake of tens of thousands of men and women , young and old , able and disable , ( who ) died in vain or have disappeared without trace , " father @entity178 , head of the @entity179 , said from @entity180			0
" in my opinion for any meaningful and sustainable reconciliation to succeed , accountability for the past is mandatory			0
" @entity3 's president has already appointed a @entity197 , saying it would be sufficient to investigate allegations of war crimes , but the @entity0 panel called the commission " deeply flawed " and ineffective			1
" the government 's notion of accountability is not in accordance with international standards , " the panel said			0
instead , the panel recommended the government start " genuine investigations " into the allegations			0
it also said @entity3 should take other immediate measures including facilitating the recovery and return of human remains to their families ; provide death certificates for the dead and missing ; release all displaced people and facilitate their return ; and disclose the fate and location of people reported to have been " forcibly disappeared			0
" for suspected rebels , the panel said , the government should publish the names of all those detained ; allow detainees regular access to family members and legal counsel ; and either charge or release detainees			2
the @entity0 itself did not escape some criticism			0
the panel recommended a review of @entity0 actions during and after the war , looking at how it implemented humanitarian and protection mandates			2
@entity37 's spokesman said he would " respond positively " to that recommendation			0
journalist @entity246 contributed to this report .			0

the opposition party says it concurs with the findings
the @entity0 panel says both the government and rebels likely committed war crimes
it recommends an immediate @entity3 investigation
the report focuses on the final stages of the war , which ended in may 2009
