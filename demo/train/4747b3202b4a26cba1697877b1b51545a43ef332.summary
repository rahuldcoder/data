-- @entity2 , the teenager whose body was found rolled in a wrestling mat in a south @entity6 high school in january died from blows to the neck and elsewhere , not from accidental suffocation , a newly released , independent autopsy report says			1
the report , obtained exclusively by @entity0 , directly contradicts the finding of an autopsy conducted by the @entity13 that determined @entity2 's death was the result of " positional asphyxia			1
" the @entity17 determined it was accidental			0
the new report blames " unexplained , apparent non-accidental , blunt force trauma			2
" @entity2 , 17 , was found january 11 in a rolled wrestling mat in a @entity22 gym in @entity23			1
inconsistencies in the initial official reports on the condition of @entity2 's body led the family and community to question the ruling on the cause of death			1
the family 's attorney , @entity37 , has sent the independent autopsy report to the @entity35 @entity41 's @entity40 , the @entity13 , the @entity35 attorney for @entity6 's @entity36 and the @entity22 coroner for review			1
the coroner has the power to call an inquest , a process that resembles a grand jury proceeding			1
after reviewing evidence and testimony , a jury would decide the cause of death , although the findings alone would have no civil or criminal consequences			0
" coroner 's inquests are not something you do every day			2
i can not tell you the last time a coroner 's inquest was done in this office , " @entity22 coroner @entity58 told @entity0			1
" i want to do the right thing by the people and the county and all concerned , i 'm just not sure we have enough information , " he said			1
" i 'm not about to refute anybody 's findings because i 'm not a doctor			2
" on may 1 , a judge granted the @entity73 ' request to exhume their son 's body for the purposes of a conducting an independent autopsy at their expense			2
that autopsy , conducted june 15 , found blunt force trauma to the right neck and soft tissues " consistent with inflicted injury			0
" that supports the narrative of the initial patient care report , written january 11 , the day @entity2 's body was discovered , citing " bruising noted to the right side jaw			1
" however , the january 25 report by the @entity23 - @entity91 cited " no signs of blunt force trauma on @entity2 's face or body			1
" the may 5 autopsy completed by the @entity13 identified " no significant injuries " a spokesperson for the @entity13 told @entity0 it stands by its report after reviewing the findings of the independent autopsy			2
@entity35 attorney @entity102 said his office has been " working on this for some time			0
i 'm sure at the appropriate time i 'll speak with his pathologist			0
" @entity102 is reviewing the case but has not launched a formal investigation			0
" there are some members of the community that question the result			0
i want to make sure members of the community and the family and everyone involved has confidence in my work and my decision , " @entity102 told @entity0			0
there was no immediate response to @entity0 's request for comment from the @entity41 's @entity40			0
the @entity73 ' attorney told @entity0 he will respond at a later date .			0
