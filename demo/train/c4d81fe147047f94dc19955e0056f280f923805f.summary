-- women stood at the forefront of the @entity3 , taking to the streets shoulder to shoulder with men in an effort to overturn oppressive old orders			1
but while their efforts have seen dictators ousted and reforms introduced , the greater rights for women many hoped would emerge from the upheaval have not materialized			1
indeed , says @entity14 activist @entity13 , the rise of political islam throughout the region in the wake of the uprising has raised the specter of hard - won gains for women being lost			1
@entity13 and four other women 's rights activists across the region started a campaign , the uprising of women in the @entity25 , on @entity26 in october 2011 , to highlight injustices against women throughout the region			1
" @entity3 took place under the banner of freedom , dignity and equality , and the three ca n't be established if women are left behind , " said @entity13 , 28 , a laboratory supervisor			1
" at every stage of history we have been given the excuse , ' it 's not the time to discuss women 's issues -- we are at war , it 's a revolution , ' or whatever			1
it 's our time to say ' we need our rights , ' " she added			1

two campaigns are currently running : one asks people to submit photos with a message of solidarity with women in the region written in @entity62			2
the other , launched on @entity64 ' @entity65 on november 25 , encourages women to share their stories of violence , abuse and harassment , in an effort to shine a spotlight on such incidents			1
dozens of women have given their accounts , with a recurring theme that they have felt unable to speak out or hold the perpetrators to account			2
" the revolution wo n't take place in secrecy , it will take place in the light , " said @entity13			0
" we have to start sharing our stories and concerns and aspirations publicly			0
it can prove that these incidents ... are not exceptional cases but part of a whole society that we should work to cure from this violence			0
" one account of abuse on the website is given by @entity96 , a 22 - year - old @entity97 woman , who writes of being sexually molested aged nine by a man who she says has never been held accountable			0
" in our culture , these issues are taboos and it is better to suppress them for the sake of the family 's ' honor , ' " she writes			2
" what an absurd honor			0
" @entity13 says the campaign is trying to challenge patriarchal cultural attitudes surrounding " honor , " often enshrined in discriminatory legal systems that punish the victims of sexual crimes			2
" we have to get rid of the blame that society inflicts upon us when it comes to issues of sexual harassment , rape and domestic violence , " she added			0

the charges were eventually dropped ( although the prosecutor has appealed the ruling ) , and the woman was offered a state apology , but not before the case attracted large protests and criticism that the woman 's treatment reflected the attitudes of the country 's new @entity147 leaders			1
earlier this year , international outrage erupted over the plight of a 16 - year - old @entity152 girl who committed suicide after a court ordered her to marry her rapist			0
read more : my heart is still in @entity158 a rise in sexual violence in the form of mob attacks on women on the streets was a pressing issue in post-revolutionary @entity166 , said @entity13 , as was the concern that women 's equality would not be enshrined in the sharia - influenced draft constitution			1
@entity13 added that the campaign was targeting other issues across the region including the persistence of patriarchal personal status laws , honor killings , female genital mutilation and forced marriages			1
@entity178 , 16 , from @entity179 , @entity180 , submitted a painting to the campaign			0
" i have a friend my age who was forced out of school into marriage , " she told @entity0			0
her paintings were an attempt to " express the injustice suffered by women , because they live in darkness and constraint , " she said			0
but @entity13 said it is still " too early " to say that the @entity3 has failed women and that could only happen if women allowed it			1
" they ca n't betray women as long as we stand up for our rights and take advantage of this moment in history , " she said			2
" if we consent to this it will happen , but if we do n't it will never happen			0

women took to the streets during the @entity3 demanding greater rights
but activists say women 's rights have fallen off the agenda after the uprising
the say the *success* of @entity147 parties is further *jeopardizing* the status of women
an online campaign is fighting to keep women 's rights in the spotlight
