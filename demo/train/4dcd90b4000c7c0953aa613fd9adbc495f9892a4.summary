-- every day , you have a close personal encounter with methane , a key ingredient of something we do n't usually mention in polite company : farts			1
perhaps that 's why methane is also called " natural gas			2
" unfortunately , neither propriety nor intestinal discipline can suppress its unpleasantness lately , because now not just us , but the @entity16 itself is farting			1
recently , three new craters , one of which measured approximately 100 feet wide and over 200 feet deep , were discovered in the @entity21 permafrost			1
the explanation for them is even more alarming than asteroid strikes : apparently , after two consecutive summers averaging 5 degrees @entity27 hotter than normal , frozen methane is not merely thawing , it 's exploding			1
scientists fear that , like chronic bad digestion , this phenomenon could be ongoing			0
methane in the air surrounding these craters already measures 53,000 times the normal concentration			1
then , just a week into a research trip , a team from @entity37 found " vast methane plumes " shooting from the sea floor off the @entity21 coast			1
columns of gas bubbles , they reported , were surfacing around their icebreaker in waters saturated with 10 to 50 times more methane than usual			2
this was the marine equivalent of melting permafrost , the undoing of frozen crystals called methane hydrates , locked solid for millennia by the pressure and temperature of deep oceans			1
the @entity59 @entity58 calculates that methane hydrates hold trillions of tons of hydrocarbons , from two to 10 times the amount as all conventional deposits of fossil fuels , but they 're probably too costly or unsafe to harvest			2
now , as ocean temperatures rise , they 've begun collapsing , spewing as much gas skyward as the thawing tundra			0
airborne methane produces 86 times the heat - trapping greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide			1
although @entity75 remains in the atmosphere far longer , after 100 years methane is still 30 times more potent			1
with sea level increases from 3 to 6 feet already predicted by the century 's end , such stunning global flatulence is n't merely embarrassing , but devastating for civilization			1
so what do we do ? first , we recognize that the reason this is happening involves a misleading term : positive feedback loop			0
it 's misleading because for us there 's nothing positive about it			0
it means that as temperatures rise , warming land and seas fart ( belch , if you prefer ) more methane -- which then warms things further , so dangerous eruptions accelerate			2
feeding back on itself , warming begets more warming			0
second , we admit that this loop began with us			0
by now , the link between fuel that jet - propels our industrialized civilization and excess co2 and methane in the atmosphere is challenged only by those who profit obscenely from it			2
third , we stop compounding the problem by ceasing to pretend that energy derived by shattering our bedrock to squeeze even more natural gas from it is somehow " clean			2
" not only does burning methane crank planetary heat higher , but fracking wells also inevitably leak			0
at least 2 % of their methane output , the @entity121 conservatively estimates , seeps into the atmosphere , thickening the gas layer that 's already turning @entity16 into a hothouse			1
nor will the other 98 % go to heat our homes			0
enormous pipelines are now proposed to transport fracked methane through @entity130 's conservation lands and orchards , through northern @entity133 's prime tourism and wild rice lake districts , and across the @entity136 - fed farms of our nation 's heartland			0
each will terminate at a port , where its gas will be exported , not used domestically			0
what will remain is scarred land and the methane that escapes or explodes ( most recently on june 26 , in @entity145 , @entity146 , into 150 - foot flames )			1
such pipelines will be subsidized by rate - payers , not by vastly wealthy corporations that own them -- unless we refuse to let them be built , and instead commit our energy funding henceforth to truly cleaner options , like wind and solar			0
the last time there was this much atmospheric @entity75 was 3 million years ago , when seas were 80 to 100 feet higher			0
since the @entity161 , atmospheric methane has more than doubled , and the amount now gushing from the seas alone is 34 times what we thought just seven years ago			0
until we stop putting more carbon dioxide and methane overhead , prepare for more rude farts to foul your air , and our future			0
with coastal cities , fertile deltas and much of the world 's rice crops threatened by floods or salination from encroaching seas -- and with grain harvests predicted to fall 10 % for each added 1 degree c of average temperature -- passing greenhouse gases is n't merely vulgar -- it 's deadly .			1

recently , three mysterious craters were discovered in the @entity21 permafrost
@entity187 : hot summers caused @entity16 to spew methane , resulting in explosions
he says airborne methane is more potent in producing greenhouse effect
@entity187 : such stunning global flatulence is deadly if we do n't embrace green energy
