-- " the sequester is coming , the sequester is coming , " cries @entity3 , speaking of the across - the - board spending reductions set to kick in next friday			1
as a result , much of the @entity9 establishment , politicians of both parties , and the media are bracing for the apocalypse			0
@entity14 worries about poisoned meat going uninspected , the air traffic control system shutting down , and schools being forced to close			0
meanwhile @entity16 is afraid that national security is threatened because our military will be gutted			0
and @entity20 is concerned there will be massive job losses and our economy will crash			0
the reality , though , is that most of what we are being told about the sequester is just a fairy tale			1
here 's why : the sequester imposes savage spending cuts actually , the sequester does n't cut federal spending at all , or rather it cuts it only in the @entity9 sense of any reduction from projected baseline increases is a cut			1
in reality , even if the sequester goes through , the federal government will spend more every single year			1
in fact , in 2023 it will be spending $ 2.39 trillion more than it does today			0
ok , but at least the reductions in projected spending are big , right ? hardly			0
this year , the sequester would slow the growth in federal spending by just $ 85 billion , from an expected , pre-sequester budget of $ 3.64 trillion -- less than a 2.3 % reduction			1
to put that in perspective , the federal government borrows $ 85 billion every 28 days			0
in fact , this actually overstates the size of this year 's cuts			2
because of ongoing contracts and the @entity59 labyrinth of federal budgeting , only $ 44 billion of that $ 85 billion will actually be cut from this year 's budget			2
the rest will be cut in future years , but attributed to this year 's budget			2
so , the real reduction in federal spending this year is just 1.2 %			0
if the federal government ca n't reduce spending by less than a penny - and - a - half on the dollar without throwing us into the dark ages , something is truly wrong			2
but are n't the cuts larger for domestic discretionary spending ? it is true that the cuts are not spread equally across all types of federal spending			1
entitlement programs , such as @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 are generally exempt -- @entity81 's @entity79 check wo n't be cut -- meaning that discretionary spending takes a disproportionately larger hit			1
still , we are talking about a reduction of less than 9 %			0
that would leave domestic discretionary spending , after adjusting for inflation , at roughly the same level as 2009			2
you recall 2009 , do n't you ? the starvation , the mass closure of our schools , the shutdown of the transportation system , the burning cities ? what about defense ? surely , the sequester guts defense defense does take the biggest cut under sequester , nearly 13 % of planned spending			1
in fact , defense spending would really be cut , in the sense of actually spending less , over the next two years			1
still , it would never fall below the level of spending we had as recently as 2007 , a year we managed to survive without @entity111 wading ashore in @entity112			1
beginning in 2015 , defense spending would start rising again , in real terms , and would exceed current levels by 2019			1
keeping all this in perspective , over the entire 10 - year period covered by the sequester , defense spending would average roughly $ 100 billion more each year ( after adjusting for inflation ) than we spent at the height of the cold war			1
i 'm still worried about the impact on the economy			0
some economists believe that the sequester will cost thousands of jobs and throw us into another recession			2
true or not ? the proposed spending reductions amount to less than 0.03 % of our gross domestic product			2
if our economy ca n't survive spending cuts of that size , we truly are @entity137			1
of course , in the short term , there will be some layoffs and furloughs			0
this will be hard on some communities that depend heavily on government spending , and even harder on those workers directly affected			1
however , most of the numbers cited about the numbers of jobs at risk come from industry groups with a vested interest in making the cuts look as bad as possible			2
this entire argument buys into the @entity156 conceit that government spending creates jobs over the long term			1
but the resources necessary to create those jobs have to be extracted from the private economy either through taxes or borrowing			0
that means the private sector then has fewer resources to invest in job creation			0
given that the private sector generally puts those resources to a more productive use , it is likely that government spending destroys more jobs over the long run than it creates			1
we can and should have a legitimate debate about the best way to cut spending			0
but let 's not be distracted by fairy tales about how the sky is falling			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			0

@entity187 : most of what we are told about the sequester is just a fairy tale
@entity185 : some think the sequester imposes savage spending cuts , but that 's not true
he says although defense spending will be cut , it would never fall below 2007 level
@entity185 : government spending may destroy more jobs in the long run than it creates
