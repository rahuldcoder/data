-- earlier this week it was reported that former @entity3 slam - dunk champion , @entity4 was planning to become head coach of @entity8 's @entity7 stripper team			0
from the moment i read it i cracked up laughing , knowing full well that my longtime friend and golf buddy , who also happens to be president of basketball operations for the @entity16 ( an @entity3 @entity17 team ) would never do such a thing , and the press release was a joke			0
i even left him a voicemail wednesday saying it was funny and ridiculous at the same time , and the next day his publicist released a statement calling it an " ill - fated attempt at humor			0
" no harm , no foul @entity4 , and anyone taking it seriously needs to really learn to laugh			0
so when i began to see tweets friday about the maniacal real estate mogul @entity32 moderating a @entity34 presidential debate in @entity35 on december 27 , i had the same reaction as the @entity16 press release : this is a bad joke			1
but according to the conservative website newsmax.com , they really have asked @entity32 to be the moderator of a real @entity34 presidential debate , hoping the men and women who desire to be commander - in - chief will show up to be quizzed by a reality tv show star			1
if this " debate " is real , it will represent one of the stupidest ideas in the history of presidential politics , and if the @entity52 has any decency , they would quickly denounce this madness and say none of its candidates will bother even responding to this stunt			1
as i 've written before , @entity32 is a political chump who should not be taken seriously			1
to watch all of these @entity34 candidates make a pilgrimage to meet with him is ridiculous			2
it 's not like he 's disgraced former president @entity66 , who often hosted candidates wanting to discuss foreign policy , especially as it related to @entity70			0
the only thing the late @entity66 and @entity32 have in common is both are disgraceful			2
it 's time that real @entity34 and conservatives put an end to this silly infatuation with @entity32			1
a question has been raised about whether he 's actually a billionaire , and he 's gone to court over the issue			0
his ideas about politics are about as useful as @entity84 's marital advice			2
and discussing the issue of character and the presidency would make @entity32 a laughingstock to the world			2
but let 's just call this what it is : a publicity stunt by newsmax.com to gain more subscribers to its growing media empire and a chance for @entity32 to bask in the glow of being taken seriously by the candidates who want to occupy the @entity101			1
if we have reduced the presidency of the @entity104 to a reality show , we deserve to get our butts kicked economically by @entity70 , and we might as well let @entity107 become the world 's biggest superpower			0
any candidate that would even consider showing up to take questions from @entity32 should have his or her head examined and summarily booted out of the race			2
in fact , let 's go ahead and let @entity32 moderate a debate			1
this will allow us to quickly narrow the field of candidates , " @entity121 " - style			0
for every candidate that shows up to get quizzed by @entity32 , we would immediately vote them off the @entity34 presidential island			1
there is no way anyone could take them seriously			0
let 's not even start with the idea of @entity32 moderating a newsmax.com debate			1
i 'd rather tune into strippers playing basketball than seeing the @entity34 presidential candidates stripped of their dignity			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity142 .			0
