-- the best chocolate cake i ever ate in @entity3 was tucked away on a discreet corner near the city 's diplomatic area			1
@entity7 , the well - known and loved @entity8 owner of @entity9 , made sure every visitor to his restaurant had a piece of gooey cake on the house , and then some			1
on saturday , the @entity15 attacked the cozy @entity8 restaurant in @entity18 's capital			1
one man detonated a suicide vest while two others stormed into the restaurant and fired at those inside , killing 21 people , 13 of them expatriates			1
one of them was @entity7			2
@entity26 had a decent security routine in place : visitors drove up and knocked			1
the @entity18 guard slid open the peep hole to take a look			0
the patron was searched before being let in to the restaurant a short distance away from the metal - door entrance			0
but unlike many other establishments visited by @entity3 's foreign residents , @entity26 had one less door , one less pat down and lacked a long corridor away from the street			1
the restaurant and its owner were what security experts call soft targets -- semi-armored and lightly guarded			1
i walked through that aluminum metal door many times during my two years living in @entity3 and working for an @entity18 media company			2
one of those times , i was on my first date with the man who 's now my husband			0
another night , after a leisurely dinner with friends -- most of it on the house under @entity7 's watch -- i was left alone to wait			2
my ride was nowhere to be seen , and @entity26 had closed			2
not wanting to bother the servers , who were ready to leave , and @entity7 , who looked tired , i slipped outside to the front of @entity26 to wait			1
@entity7 tried to lure me back inside , but i also enjoyed the rare few moments outside in @entity3			1
when i told @entity7 i would be fine , he brought out a plastic chair and sat with me			2
@entity7 was originally from @entity8 , but it was clear from all our conversations that he loved @entity18			2
that night , we laughed , talked about @entity69 , and watched his cat slink up and down the muddy street			0
forty - five minutes later , my ride showed up			0
i went back to @entity26 dozens of times after that visit , always catching a smile and laugh from @entity7 -- with a hunk of chocolate cake			1
it seems like almost everyone who has lived in @entity3 has a @entity7 story			1
after the attack , friends , family and frequent patrons of the restaurant immediately took to social media to express their concern			2
" any word on @entity7 , the owner of @entity26 , or his staff ? " development worker @entity87 wrote in a @entity89 post			1
once security officials confirmed his death , photos popped on @entity96 as people who knew @entity7 and his restaurant shared their memories			1
albums with titles like " @entity26 " were filled with pictures of groups of smiling people gathered around long , wooden tables			2
@entity7 , like most nights that he was in the country , was in the building the night of the attack , wandering around the restaurant with a cigarette or in his office , most likely			1
he lived above the @entity8 restaurant , keeping a loving eye on the falafel , staff and visitors			0
for many of us , it 's hard to believe someone who loved @entity3 so much -- and who was so much a part of the @entity3 we loved -- has become a casualty in a deadly attack			1
@entity7 's restaurant allowed for quiet dinners or raucous get - togethers after long work days			2
@entity3 , known to the foreign diplomat , aid worker and journalist inhabitants as the " @entity134 , " was a relatively safe place compared to the rest of the country			0
much of my two years there were spent haphazardly throwing on a headscarf , walking down to the nearest supermarket to buy potato chips or use decent wi - fi at a cafe			0
the city never felt unsafe			0
only one similar event comes to mind in recent years			0
in january 2011 , a suicide bomber blew himself up in a supermarket popular with expatriates and middle - class @entity18 alike			0
those of us in the @entity154 were thrown off for a few days , left jarred , vowing it was time to get out			0
after a few weeks riddled with lockdowns , the event faded into the city 's memory -- a moment of violence that had passed			0
this attack seems different , though			0
perhaps not for the @entity18 civilians who have lived through similar attacks for the last decade			0
but for the people who live in and love @entity18 out of choice , it does change something			0
i do n't know what this means for the country 's upcoming election , for @entity18 after the @entity175 troop withdrawals scheduled for later this year , or for the foreigners who flock to the country , investing themselves in the nation and its people			0
but i do know that without @entity7 in @entity3 , the city is a darker place .			1

restaurant owner @entity7 was among 21 people killed in a @entity15 attack
his @entity26 du liban was a beloved spot for expats to gather in @entity3
visitors got smiles and laughs from @entity7 -- with a hunk of chocolate cake
