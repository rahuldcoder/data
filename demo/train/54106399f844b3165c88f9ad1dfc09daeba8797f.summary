guns are an @entity2 pastime			1
a way to feed a family			2
a way to protect a family			2
those are some of the words gun owners use to describe their relationship with firearms and the powerful emotions that stir up when they talk about them			1
in the days after a gunman killed a dozen theater - goers in @entity20 , @entity21 , talk turned to gun ownership , access and restrictions , as it often does after mass shootings			1
@entity26 went to the firearms owners and asked for their perspective			1
we received more than 400 ireports from gun owners			1
the stories of gun ownership in @entity2 and the feelings behind it are diverse and not so easily explained			1
here are five things they want the world to know : " owning a firearm is not a right that i take lightly			2
" -- @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 @entity42 , a firefighter and information technology director in @entity43 , @entity44 , grew up around firearms and now owns guns for protection , recreational shooting , competition , hunting and investment			1
when seconds count , he feels confident knowing he could defend himself against a violent criminal			2
he is aware that gun ownership comes with heavy responsibilities			1
that has meant attending hunter safety courses , shooting workshops , specific training for pistols , rifles , shotguns and self defense , among other instruction			1
@entity66 drives opposition to gun control @entity42 is the father of a toddler , who he already talks to about guns			1
when the time is right , he will teach his boy how to properly handle firearms so the child can pass on the family tradition			1
" he does n't touch them , he does n't play with them , and there is no free - willy - nilly pointing toy gun at people , " @entity42 wrote			1
" he asks questions when they are out or when i am cleaning and doing work on them and they are answered			2
most importantly my guns are secured			2
" " if you love your children , you will teach them how to handle a real firearm			2
" -- @entity89 , @entity20 , @entity90 too many children are exposed to the fantasy weapons of video games and not real ones , says @entity89			2
he calls himself a " @entity101 liberal " but also feels strongly that the more he can take the mystery and glamour out of firearms for his 11 - year - old son , the safer his child will be			1
he thinks other parents should do the same			0
debate : gun owners go head - to - head in wake of @entity20 tragedy he knows how that sounds -- an 11 - year - old who has his own guns and a mother who allows it			1
but maybe , he says , " if more families worked towards how to safely handle firearms , we would have less firearm accidents			1
" " @entity118 being exposed to a real weapon by someone who loves them does not allow them to learn what an improperly handled weapon can do , " @entity89 said			0
" with all the video games , kids have become too desensitized to what a firearm really is and what it does			0
all they get to do is just shoot away ... score some points and never really think about what it really does			0
" " firearms are a way of life			1
" -- @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 @entity137 , 29 , grew up fearing guns			0
but as she grew older and spent time with hunters and shooting sportsmen , she learned " they are vital tools for survival and have a special culture attached to their use			1
" living in @entity139 , she now owns pistols , shotguns and rifles for hunting and sport shooting , and says guns " can be a gateway to a wonderful sportsman lifestyle			1
" she believes gun owners have a responsibility " to be kind and sensitive to folks who do n't have exposure to firearms			1
there is so much fear surrounding this issue and i think mutual understanding and respect can replace this fear if people try			0
" @entity169 @entity168 , a lawyer , pistol instructor and competition shooter in @entity172 , @entity173 , echoed the sentiments of other gun owners when he wrote , " shooting is about more than hunting and self defense			1
it is about having fun			0
" " fun is the reason many people purchase these so - called ' assault rifles , ' because let 's face it , the @entity185 is incredibly fun to shoot , " he said			0
" nobody ' needs ' a @entity188 either -- but a @entity188 is a heck of a lot more fun to drive than a @entity192			0
" " as a young woman who lives alone and lives in a rather rough area of town , guns are what allow me to sleep at night			0
" -- @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 self - described country kid @entity199 , 24 , has never had to use a gun for self - defense			1
but she keeps a loaded handgun in her nightstand and an unloaded revolver in her vehicle			0
" some people might say move , find a better city to live in , whatever			0
i 'm happy where i am and i 'm happy with my ability to protect myself , " she said			0
" those skills come from a lifetime of safe gun training and ownership			1
" in @entity216 , @entity44 , @entity217 did n't know anything about firearms until she bought her first gun and learned to shoot a couple years ago			1
she felt that was her duty as a mother , " in a world where fewer and fewer people take responsibility for their own thoughts , words and actions			0
" putting her gun into its holster each morning has become as routine as slipping into a pair of pants or shoes , says @entity235 , a mother in @entity236 , @entity173			2
she got her concealed handgun permit about a year ago			0
when she 's with her daughter , she no longer worries that something bad will happen to either of them			0
" i know there are still bad people out there , " she said			0
" i feel a peace of mind knowing that the bad people that commit crimes now have one more person secretly fighting against them			0
" @entity249 works the night shift			0
it comforts him to know his wife sleeps next to a revolver			0
" and it comforts her as well , " said @entity249 , 22 , of @entity254 , @entity255			0
" she knows how to be safe with a gun , and how to use it			2
" " it disturbs me when i hear people say things like , ' if someone in the crowd in @entity21 had been armed , the whole thing could have been stopped			1
' " -- @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity255 it 's a point we heard many times			0
if a gun owner could have carried his weapon into the theater that night , he might have wounded or killed the shooter -- or at least saved some lives			2
commenters debated it at length on @entity26			1
commenters debate guns , ' what if ' " i would have shot back , " @entity283 , 28 , a veteran in @entity284 , wrote in his @entity26			1
" if nothing else , the attacker would have to focus on the civilians shooting at him instead of all the unarmed people running around			2
but more likely , it 's wishful thinking to believe " you could have stopped the whole thing , if only you had been there with your .38			0
" said @entity266 , an airline pilot who owned his first gun at 13 years old			2
" as someone who has some firearm and self - defense training , i find it laughable to think that the average @entity301 , in a dark theater filled with teargas , could take out a well armed and armored assailant with a five - round .38 special , " he said			0
" arming more people will only eventually end in an accidental death			0
" cash said he rarely fires weapons now , except for at the shooting range , and believes there should be strict rules for firearm purchases			2
" i do not think the solution is to arm more people			0
i think the solution is to figure out what is triggering these people to do this , and to work on that			0
" what 's your take ? see all of the @entity26 submissions here and add your thoughts in the comments			1
we tried something new with this story and posted the quotes from gun owners on @entity331			1
we encourage you to pin the quotes you like best and keep the conversation going .			0
