-- a group of indigenous @entity3 protesters made headlines for a second day in a row friday after they gathered outside the @entity3 @entity6 and set fire to the country 's flag			1
the move came a day after security officers dragged prime minister @entity12 out of a @entity14 restaurant after scores of angry protesters surrounded the building during a luncheon ceremony			1
aborigine leaders on friday criticized the actions of the group , saying they jeopardized efforts to reconcile indigenous australians with the broader society			1
video on the website of the @entity26 showed a circle of protesters outside @entity6 in @entity14 setting light to an @entity3 flag and chanting , " @entity32 was , always will be @entity34 land			1
" " i think it was totally uncalled for , " said @entity35 , a co-chair of @entity36 , which promotes the improving of relationships between @entity38 and the wider @entity3 community			1
" it 's just not acceptable that they burn the flag of @entity3			1
" the police are investigating the lighting of a fire in an unauthorized place , a police spokeswoman said			1
she said the act of burning the @entity3 flag is not a criminal offense in @entity14			1
the move by the protesters , connected to a long - running @entity34 demonstration known as the " tent embassy , " was likely to add to dismay across the country after the disturbance involving @entity12 on thursday , @entity3 's national day			1
security officers took @entity12 and opposition leader @entity60 out of the restaurant after between 50 and 100 protesters circled it during a lunchtime ceremony , bashing windows and brandishing sticks and rocks , according to the police			1
@entity12 was presenting medals to emergency service workers during an event for the national day			2
a spontaneous protest erupted nearby among an @entity34 rights group commemorating the 40th anniversary of the tent embassy			0
protesters were chanting " shame " and " racist " as they banged on the restaurant 's three glass sides , according to the @entity26 they were apparently upset about remarks @entity60 made earlier thursday suggesting it may be time to reconsider the tent embassy 's relevance			2
the makeshift embassy was set up 40 years ago by four @entity34 men who planted a beach umbrella on the lawn in front of @entity89 in @entity14 to protest the failure of the coalition government at the time , led by prime minister @entity92 , to recognize @entity34 land rights			1
it has endured despite successive government attempts to close it			0
" i think the indigenous people of @entity3 can be very proud of the respect in which they are held by every @entity3 , " @entity60 had said in response to a question about whether the tent embassy was still relevant , according to a transcript of the comments posted on his website			1
" and yes , i think a lot has changed since then and i think it probably is time to move on from that			0
" local media reported that @entity12 was visibly shaken , and stumbled during the encounter			0
photographs showed her being led to a waiting vehicle by a group of at least seven security officers , losing a shoe in the process			0
@entity116 showed her being hustled into the vehicle , surrounded by security officers , some carrying shields , as protesters shouted , " shame on you			1
" the shoe was collected by protesters , who proclaimed it a trophy			2
but @entity34 leaders were unimpressed			2
" it 's pretty appalling behavior , " said @entity127 , the commissioner for @entity34 and @entity129 social justice at the @entity130			2
" and while we enjoy the right to protest and raise issues in this country , i do n't think we should be resorting to that type of violence , " he said friday on @entity26 radio			0
there was also criticism of the protesters ' actions in the @entity3 press			1
" those who want to preserve the embassy should make their point in a peaceful , respectful way , " said an editorial on friday in the @entity3 , a national daily			1
" their actions yesterday can only have damaged their cause			0
" there were no injuries thursday , and no arrests were made , the police said			2
video from the @entity26 showed some minor struggles breaking out between the authorities and protesters			2
a spokesman for the tent embassy , @entity162 , said @entity60 's remarks and the police 's behavior had incited the disturbance			2
speaking friday on @entity26 radio , @entity162 said that news media coverage of the events had overly dramatized the protesters actions			0
" there was no threat to them at all , " he said , referring to @entity12 and @entity60			0
the episode took place against the backdrop of efforts to change the nation 's constitution to give better recognition to indigenous australians , often referred to as @entity34 and @entity129 peoples			0
last week , a panel issued a government - commissioned report suggesting ways the constitution could be altered to achieve that aim			0
@entity34 have suffered at the hands of later settlers and the government they established			0
@entity3 politicians have since apologized for the past mistreatment , but @entity38 remain disadvantaged socially and economically compared with the overall population			1
explicit references to @entity38 in the original @entity195 , drafted in the late 19th century , were subsequently deemed to be negative			0
@entity3 voted overwhelmingly to remove those points in a 1967 referendum , but many people say the document can be further improved to acknowledge the role of the country 's indigenous population			1
the panel -- which included @entity34 leaders , business executives , legal experts and members of the main political parties -- has handed over its report to @entity12 , whose government has promised to hold a referendum on the matter by the next general election			0
the events of the past two days may have made that process more complicated for those in favor of the referendum			0
" i think it 's going to increase the challenge , " said @entity35 of @entity36			0
" there was always going to be a challenge to get people on board with the constitutional changes			0
" he said the tent embassy protesters ' actions would detract from " successful advocacy taking place between indigenous groups and the government at the moment on reconciliation			2
" @entity0 's @entity235 and journalist @entity236 contributed to this report .			0
