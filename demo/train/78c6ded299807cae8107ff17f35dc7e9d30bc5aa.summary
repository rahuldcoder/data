-- the co-founder of @entity2 , an online - annotation website , has been fired after marking up the 137 - page manifesto of @entity5 killer @entity4 with comments that are being called tasteless and creepy			1
@entity7 used his site , which lets users post notes interpreting rap and hip - hop lyrics , to comment on @entity4 's exhaustive autobiography , which includes his reasons for killing six people in @entity16 , @entity5 , on friday before apparently turning a gun on himself			1
in more than one note , @entity7 called @entity4 's writing " beautiful , " and in another he speculated on the attractiveness of @entity4 's sister			1
in a journal and in a video posted online , @entity4 had expressed frustrations about not finding women to date and resentment toward couples who kissed in front of him			2
he also wrote that his anger toward women intensified after he overheard his sister having sex with her boyfriend			0
" my guess : his sister is smokin hot , " @entity7 wrote			1
@entity7 also made comments about a girl @entity4 described as the only female his age he ever saw naked			1
" @entity40 will go on to attend @entity41 and become a spoiled hottie , " @entity7 wrote , before adding , " this is an artful sentence , beautifully written ...			0
" @entity2 has removed the notations			0
but they were captured and reposted online by @entity46 , re / code and other news sites			0
why # @entity48 took off on @entity49 on monday , @entity2 co-founder and ceo @entity50 released a written statement saying that @entity7 had resigned			1
" @entity7 , one of my co-founders , annotated the piece with annotations that not only did n't attempt to enhance anyone 's understanding of the text , but went beyond that into gleeful insensitivity and misogyny , " he wrote			1
" all of which is contrary to everything we 're trying to accomplish at @entity2			0
" @entity65 continued : " @entity7 is my friend			0
he 's a brilliant , creative , complicated person with a ton of love in his heart			0
without @entity69 would not exist , and i am grateful for all he has done to help @entity2 succeed			0
" but i can not let him compromise the @entity2 mission -- a mission that remains almost as delicate and inchoate as it was when we three founders decided to devote our lives to it almost 5 years ago			1
" @entity50 said the site , which describes its mission as helping users " discover the meaning of rap lyrics , " decided to post @entity4 's writings in hopes that users ' annotations " will eventually be a good resource for people looking to understand this tragedy			1
" part one of @entity4 's writings currently appears on @entity2 between breakdowns of the lyrics to " @entity90 " by @entity90 and @entity91 's " @entity92			1
" in december , @entity93 penalized @entity2 after a user exposed what he called a scheme to manipulate search results and drive traffic to the site			2
the site removed the offending links and regained its @entity93 ranking			0
as is frequently the case in today 's digital world , the social - media backlash against @entity7 's comments was fast and brutal			1
" appalling use of technology by already questionable behaving site , " re / code co-executive editor @entity105 wrote on @entity49 with a link to that site 's story			0
" what 's most newsworthy about the story of the @entity2 founder is n't that he was fired but that he did n't think his words were wrong , " tweeted author and tech journalist @entity112			2
observers also criticized @entity7 's own @entity49 feed , which features many posts that could be viewed as crude at best and sexist at worst			2
on monday , @entity7 took to @entity49 to beg forgiveness for his comments			2
" i want to apologize to everyone , " he wrote			0
" i need to hear these criticisms , reflect for real , and work on becoming a better person			0
