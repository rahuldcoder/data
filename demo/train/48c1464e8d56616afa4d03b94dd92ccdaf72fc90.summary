-- the case of three women held as slaves in south @entity4 has shocked not just the @entity6 public , but people across the world			1
what makes this particular case stand out is the length of time these women are said to have been held captive - over 30 years			1
although this is an extreme example , this type of slavery is not uncommon in @entity4			1
figures from the @entity16 and @entity17 for this year show that there were 389 potential victims of trafficking in the capital			0
although the women in this case are not believed to have been trafficked , the case shows that hidden slavery is taking place around us , within our everyday environments , whether it be on construction sites , mobile soup runs for the homeless , at cheap takeaways , in nail bars and in domestic homes in our neighborhoods			1

i recently published a report called " @entity42 -- exposing human trafficking in everyday @entity4 " that uncovered just how diverse that trafficking is , and that no matter where you live you are probably not that far from someone who is being exploited			1
sadly , authorities are still blind to this			2
things need to change , urgently			0
an overstretched anti-trafficking unit in @entity4 's @entity52 , and a figure - driven culture , means police are focusing on large - scale organized cases , and neglecting the informal cases that take longer to find , but are sometimes more serious			1
in this case the three victims were lucky			0
they are said to have contacted a charity that was able to successfully rescue them			0
many are not so fortunate			0

of course budgets are tight , but if the money made in trafficking exploits is recuperated through the use of specialist teams , then these investigations could pay for themselves			0
in my report , i made some recommendations that could help tackle the lack of action on informal types of slavery			2
these included the @entity52 's anti-trafficking unit being urgently protected from further integration into other units , additional human trafficking units to be established in other police forces across the @entity6 , human trafficking to become part of the core syllabus for training new police recruits , and special points of contact to be established in every borough 's police force			2
the police are not the only agency that needs better systems put in place			0
it is also vitally important that social workers , teachers , health professionals and benefit agency staff receive training on how to spot signs of trafficking and slavery , and who to consult if they have concerns			0
for too long many @entity115 have assumed that trafficking happens elsewhere , and statutory agencies have concentrated too much resource into trafficking that happens through organized crime with a concentration on drugs and sex workers			0
the case in south @entity4 shows that slaves could be living next door			1
