-- over the past several years , researchers have noticed an odd pattern in the relationship between body weight and alzheimer 's disease : middle - aged people have a higher long - term risk of developing the disease if they 're overweight or obese , while older people have a lower risk of the disease if they 're carrying excess weight			1
a new study , published this week in the journal @entity15 , may offer a clue to this so - called obesity paradox			0
non-overweight individuals in their late 60s , 70s , and early 80s who have no outward symptoms of @entity22 's are more likely than their heavier peers to have biological markers ( or biomarkers ) of the disease , the study found			1
this finding raises the possibility that weight loss or a low body mass index ( @entity33 ) later in life may be an early warning sign of mental decline , the researchers say			2
" weight changes or body composition changes may actually be a manifestation of disease , which would explain the obesity being an apparent protective factor , " says @entity36 , @entity37 , the lead author of the study and the associate director of the @entity40 , in @entity41			1
@entity0 : 25 signs and symptoms of @entity22 's disease well before memory loss and other symptoms appear , @entity22 's may trigger metabolism changes that promote weight loss , @entity36 says			1
" in general , we think of @entity22 's as a brain disease , but this is evidence that there are systemic problems throughout the body in the early stages of @entity22 's			2
" @entity36 and his colleagues analyzed data from the @entity64 , a huge study spanning 58 hospitals and universities that 's funded by the @entity68 and an array of nonprofit organizations and drug companies			0
the goal of the initiative is to find ways to measure the progression of @entity22 's and the precursor condition known as mild cognitive impairment			1
the researchers looked at 101 people who underwent brain scans designed to identify the plaques and abnormal tangle of proteins that are the hallmark of @entity22 's , and another 405 people whose cerebrospinal fluid was analyzed for fragments of these proteins ( beta - amyloid peptide and tau )			0
each group included some people with @entity22 's disease , some with mild cognitive impairment , and some with no signs of mental deterioration			1
@entity0 : 7 ways to protect your memory there was no connection between @entity33 and @entity22 's biomarkers in the patients who actually had @entity22 's			2
but in the other two groups , lower @entity33 was associated with higher levels of biomarkers and a higher likelihood of having brain plaques and tangles			0
among people with mild cognitive impairment , for instance , 85 percent of non-overweight individuals had signs of these brain abnormalities , compared to just 48 percent of those who were overweight or obese			0
( a bmi of 25 or above is considered overweight			0
) @entity115 , @entity37 , an attending neurologist at @entity116 , in @entity117 , who was not involved in the new research , agrees with the authors that the findings suggest that @entity22 's can affect the entire body early on			1
" the most obvious manifestations of alzheimer 's disease are in the brain , but @entity22 's disease has a large number of effects on the body as well , " says @entity115 , the principal investigator of a long - running study on aging and @entity22 's			1
" the brain regulates blood pressure and respiratory rate and pulse and hunger and satiety and blood flow to various organs in the body , so it would n't be surprising if a widespread disease of the brain had effects on many , many different aspects of bodily function			0
" @entity0 : aging workforce means dementia on the job could rise the study shows only an association , not cause and effect , so @entity36 and his colleagues ca n't be sure that @entity22 's directly causes weight loss ( or prevents weight gain )			1
in fact , the researchers found no association between @entity33 changes and @entity22 's biomarkers in a subset of study participants whose weight was tracked for two years			2
may @entity160 , @entity161 , a staff scientist at the @entity162 who studies risk factors for dementia , described the study as " very strong " overall			0
but , she says , " the results would have been a lot stronger if they found weight loss over time is associated with increased @entity22 pathology , also over time			2
" the relationship between weight loss and the progression of @entity22 's is likely a two - way street , @entity115 says			1
people who start to experience declines in mental function may shop for groceries less regularly , cook less frequently , and eat less -- and the poor nutrition that results could in turn accelerate the progression of the disease , he says			0
@entity0 : foods that may help save your memory " it seems pretty likely to me that both things are true -- that good health practices prevent illness , and health practices may fall apart in the early stages of illness and accelerate cognitive and physical decline , " @entity115 says			0
