-- it 's been a long time between wins for @entity3 , but the @entity5 skier is determined to prove he is over his injury problems			1
on saturday @entity3 celebrated his first @entity8 victory since 2006 , having recently returned to top - level action after missing all of last season			1
the 30 - year - old had placed 29th in friday 's @entity13 race at @entity14 , but stormed home in saturday 's downhill after starting 39th in the @entity18 event			1
his triumph came in the same @entity21 race where he earned his only other career win six years ago , as he earned a podium place for the first time since 2007			1
the two - time @entity26 took advantage of improving conditions to head off @entity30 's surprise second - placer @entity31 by 0.19 seconds , with @entity34 @entity33 finishing third from @entity36 's @entity35			1
@entity37 : inside @entity8 venues " @entity39 was a huge factor but hats off to @entity33 and @entity35 who ran in the snow and the fog , " @entity3 said			1
" when i heard @entity31 coming into the lead i said , ' right on , it 's on , it 's open ! ' " i 've always believed i had the speed			1
i hope to prove it through the year			2
but i guess no points to 100 points is n't that consistent			2
" i 'm just happy to feel good again			0
my body 's feeling good			2
i had the flu , but battled that off			0
i had rib issues the first few races because i put it into the fence while training in @entity60			0
the @entity65 last year , the knees years before that and the back -- this is the best gift i could have			2
" friday 's race winner @entity66 was fifth , extending his overall lead to 177 points from absent @entity5 @entity69 , who will return to action for sunday 's giant slalom across the mountain at @entity73			1
" having trouble because of too much snow is in many ways a good thing , " the @entity36 wrote on his blog on saturday			0
" @entity79 is good for ski business			0
and we 're all a part of the business			0
but as a racer and an athlete days like todays like today are tough			0
" we want to compete under equal and fair conditions			2
but sometimes that 's not possible in the mountains			0
we didnt have good conditions but it could have been worse			0
the poor guys that started first had no chance			0
racing is less fun on days like today			0
" meanwhile , saturday 's women 's @entity8 @entity13 race at @entity97 was called off due to heavy snow at the @entity100 resort			1
@entity97 is the traditional host of the start of the main @entity104 swing of the @entity8 season , having staged men 's races last weekend as part of the traditional @entity109 ( " races of the first snow " ) .			1

*history* *repeats* as @entity3 wins second @entity8 race of his career
the @entity5 skier 's only other victory came at the same @entity18 downhill event in 2006
the 30 - year - old beat second - placed @entity30 @entity31 , with @entity34 's @entity33 third
@entity66 was fifth in *difficult* conditions to extend his overall lead to 177 points
