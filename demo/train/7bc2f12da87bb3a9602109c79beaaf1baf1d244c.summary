the @entity7 crashed out to @entity8 in 2013 -- his first ever opening - round loss at a grand slam -- yet was able to see off @entity12 's @entity11 4 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 3 6 - 3 this time around , despite an early scare on @entity14			1
the @entity15 came into the competition in good form having claimed a ninth @entity19 championship just a few weeks ago , yet the @entity7 found himself one set down after @entity11 , ranked 51st in the world , managed to break to take a 5 - 4 lead in the opener			2
that early sting , however , seemed to awaken @entity4 from his slumber as the tournament 's second seed began to find his rhythm and went on to claim three straight sets to wrap up the victory			2
" for me , always emotions are so high when i 'm able to play on this @entity14 , " @entity4 told reporters afterwards			0

his reward is a second - round tie against @entity121 @entity120			0
