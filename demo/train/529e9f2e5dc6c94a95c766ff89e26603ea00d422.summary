-- @entity2 car manufacturer @entity1 is returning to @entity3 in 2015 as an engine partner with @entity6 racing team @entity5 , a deal which will renew one of the most successful partnerships in motorsport 's elite class			1
their previous five - year collaboration powered @entity13 and @entity14 to a clean sweep of world titles between 1988 and 1992			0
the 1988 car , the @entity1 mp / 4 , has gone down in @entity3 legend after winning all but one of the 16 races that season			1
@entity1 ran its own team from 2006 until the end of 2008 when it dramatically withdrew from the sport because of the global economic crisis			2
there is currently no @entity2 representation in @entity3 and @entity1 's comeback to the grid with the multi-year @entity5 technology partnership will mark an important step for the island nation , which has a long and successful history in motorsport			1
" it 's fantastic news for everyone who loves @entity3 to be able to welcome @entity1 back , " said @entity5 team principal @entity36 as the news was announced in @entity38			1
" together , we 're about to embark on a new and extremely exciting chapter in @entity5 's history			0
together we have a great legacy -- and we 're utterly committed to maintaining it			0
" like @entity5 , @entity1 is a company with motor racing woven into the fabric of its heritage			1
whilst both companies are fully aware that we 're embarking on a very demanding journey together , we 're hugely committed to the success of the partnership			0
" we 'll spend the next 18 months working together to ensure that we 're fully established and competitive ahead of our first grand prix together in 2015			0
" @entity5 has used @entity57 engines since 1995 and will honor its contract with the @entity60 company -- which now owns the defunct @entity62 team -- to use its equipment in 2014			1
hybrid technologies next season will see the @entity66 -- motorsport 's governing body -- introduce major new rule changes affecting engine technology			0
the new regulations include the introduction of a 1.6 - liter turbo engine with increased reliance on the hybrid kinetic energy recovery system known as @entity76			0
@entity77 , president and ceo of the @entity79 , said the chance to explore new technologies in elite racing was one of the attractions of returning to @entity3			1
" ever since its establishment , @entity1 has been a company which grows by taking on challenges in racing , " @entity77 said			2
" @entity1 has a long history of advancing our technologies and nurturing our people by participating in the world 's most prestigious automobile racing series			2
" the new f1 regulations with their significant environmental focus will inspire even greater development of our own advanced technologies and this is central to our participation in @entity3			0
" we have the greatest respect for the @entity66 's decision to introduce these new regulations that are both highly challenging but also attractive to manufacturers that pursue environmental technologies			0
" many engine manufacturers see @entity3 as an opportunity to showcase the hybrid technologies they are developing on their road cars			2
@entity2 renewal the return of @entity1 means there will be four car manufacturers supplying engines to @entity3 in 2015 , the others being @entity116 's @entity115 , @entity118 luxury brand @entity117 and the @entity119 - owned @entity57			1
@entity1 blamed the economic crisis for its decision to pull its team out of @entity3 in 2008 with then @entity1 president @entity123 saying in an emotional press conference : " this difficult decision has been made in light of the quickly deteriorating operating environment facing the global auto industry ... and the sudden contraction of the world economies			1
" the new venture with @entity5 is important for @entity2 motorsport and for the country , which is still regaining confidence following the earthquake and tsunami in 2011			2
@entity2 is the world 's third - largest car manufacturer behind @entity139 and the @entity140 and in 2011 @entity1 's operations were severely disrupted by the disaster			1
returning to @entity3 also represents an opportunity to restore confidence in both the brand and the @entity2 motorsport industry			2
the economic downturn also affected motorcycle manufacturer @entity148 , which pulled out of the @entity149 following @entity151 's withdrawal in 2009			0
@entity1 first entered a works team in @entity3 in 1964 but withdrew at the end of the 1968 season following the death of @entity156 , who had been driving a prototype vehicle at the @entity116 @entity158			1
the company returned to @entity3 in 1984 , providing turbo engines to @entity161 before agreeing a partnership to supply @entity5			1
in 2004 @entity1 bought a stake in the @entity165 team before taking sole ownership ahead of the 2006 season			0
the highlight of this second era running its own team was @entity172 's win at the @entity173			0
the company had poured huge amounts of capital into @entity3 and ironically the team was on the verge of great success before pulling out in 2008			0
team principal @entity180 led a rescue package to buy out the team and continue work on @entity1 's 2009 car design -- the car would help @entity172 win the world drivers ' title and the constructors ' championship for @entity190 that season			1
@entity57 then bought the team , based in @entity193 , @entity194 , in 2010 and it is once again on an upward curve , taking three pole positions and two third - places on the podium so far in 2013			0
@entity62 chief @entity200 has now backed @entity1 to return to the front of the grid in partnership with @entity5 , which lost former world champion @entity204 to @entity190 's @entity57 team after last season and has struggled this year			1
" it is a great pleasure to see @entity1 back in @entity3 , " he said			2
" their engine technology and passion for motorsport make them a natural contender			0

@entity2 car giant @entity1 will return to @entity3 as an engine supplier in 2015
@entity1 will renew its successful partnership with @entity6 racing team @entity5
@entity5 will continue using @entity57 engines in 2014 when new rules come in
@entity1 says new engine rules in @entity3 will help it develop " greener " technologies
