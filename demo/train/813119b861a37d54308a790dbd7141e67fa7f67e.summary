@entity1 @entity0 is a lanky , 26 - year - old from @entity4 , @entity5 with a good job on @entity7 and a healthy adoration for @entity9			1
and every day , he pretends to be @entity10 on the @entity11			2
as @entity10 's in - house digital strategist , it is @entity0 's job to channel the freshman senator online , engage activists on @entity17 and @entity18 and promote @entity10 's media appearances and speeches			1
in just a few years , @entity10 has gone from working as the state @entity21 and as a corporate attorney to become one of the most talked - about politicians on the @entity26			1
@entity10 began traveling to @entity27 and @entity28 in 2013 — and his many conservative fans are eager to see him run for president			1
@entity0 joined @entity10 in the early days of his @entity32 campaign in 2011 , when @entity10 was an unknown candidate with little hope to defeat the establishment - backed lt. gov. @entity34			1
@entity0 's responsibilities on the campaign were two-fold : help manage @entity10 's online presence and drive him to events around the state			1
on the day of @entity10 's first debate , @entity0 was driving @entity10 in @entity42 when he ran a red light while fiddling with a gps			1
an oncoming vehicle slammed into the driver 's side of his @entity48 with a brutal crunch			0
no one was seriously injured , but it left $ 8,500 in damage to his car			0
@entity0 says he was " unceremoniously promoted " after the accident -- to behind a computer			2
" it was amazing how quickly we decided i should focus full - time on just the digital stuff rather than driving him around as well , " recalled @entity0 , who had driven @entity10 around the state for ten months			1
while @entity10 says he 's on @entity17 " constantly " through his @entity62 , the senator leaves much of the leg work to his old driver , @entity0 , who condenses the long - winded lawmaker into 140 - character bites			1
" out of any staff in the office , @entity10 trusts josh the most with his voice , " @entity10 spokeswoman @entity67 told @entity2			1
" @entity0 understands his voice and understands what he would want to promote			2
" according to data from @entity18 and @entity17 provided to @entity74 in december , @entity10 is mentioned more on social media than any other politician			2
between sept. 1 and dec. 1 , @entity10 's accounts were mentioned on @entity17 , 4.5 million times , which is 1.7 million more than former secretary of state @entity79 and 2.6 million more than the closest @entity80 , @entity81			2
@entity10 's most popular tweets , unsurprisingly , tend to be when he sounds the most uncompromising			2
his most retweeted post in 2014 included a call to impeach attorney general @entity85 ; on @entity18 , a joke about president @entity87 being the worst president in history received nearly 80,000 " likes " and more than 18 million impressions on the site , according to data provided by @entity10 office to @entity2			1
that cohesion between @entity10 and @entity0 dates back to the countless hours the duo spent alone together crisscrossing @entity5 during the campaign			1
@entity0 accompanied @entity10 to scores of events and quickly memorized every line of @entity10 's old speeches			1
@entity0 , who prefers to stay behind the scenes as much as possible — he declined to be interviewed on camera -- says part of the secret to @entity10 's success online is his willingness to engage on issues that supporters are eager to discuss			1
" half the time if you try to force issues and force messaging that 's not what your activists want to talk about , you 're doing damage to yourself , " @entity0 said			0
" if you had somebody who did n't speak as well [ as @entity10 ] or have the same type of personality , i could see it being a lot more difficult			2
i think that 's definitely a big part of it			0
but you 've also got to know who your audience is and speak to them			0
" that approach , however , has left @entity10 with a list of enemies in @entity1 , where some in his own party sees him as a rabble - rouser and an ideologue who refuses to compromise			2
" if you 're from @entity5 , that 's the right thing to do			0
that 's what they expect you to do , " @entity0 said			0
it 's easy to see why @entity10 and @entity0 get along so well			1
in college , @entity0 was a member of the " @entity140 , " a group traditionally known to be more conservative than the @entity142 at the @entity143 in @entity144			0
as a point of personality , @entity0 also knows a thing or two about being a troublemaker : late last year , he logged onto @entity150 's @entity17 account when she was away from her desk and posted a string of silly tweets full of emojis and a solicitation of advice for where she could get a good dye job in @entity1			2
" do n't ever leave your computer unlocked around him , " she tweeted after the prank			0
@entity0 got his start with the @entity165 before joining @entity144 - based @entity166 , a digital strategy firm founded by @entity80 strategist @entity168 , who directed @entity10 's digital operations until late last year			1
last november , @entity168 , a digital whiz who deserves a great deal of credit for @entity10 's success online , made a surprise move to work for @entity176 sen. @entity81 , a potential future rival if both men run for the @entity80 presidential nomination			2
@entity0 said he did n't see it coming			0
" we had just been meeting about some of the stuff that we would 've liked to get done and then it just came out of nowhere , " he said			0
" it 's been a little interesting since he left to go do @entity81 's stuff , but we still talk			0
" in an email to @entity2 , @entity168 praised @entity0 's work , but predicted that @entity10 would face serious competition in the online space if he competes in 2016			1
" @entity0 has always worked incredibly hard and he has done a great job of remembering the importance of engagement when it comes to social , " @entity168 said			0
" it has been a space that senator @entity10 has excelled in since 2011 but i 'm certain that it 's going to get harder for them as other big names with big brands join the fray			0
" while @entity168 ' departure came as blow to @entity10 's operation , it put @entity0 in a position to play a stronger role in the senator 's day - to - day online operation			1
@entity10 's online break - out moment came in september 2013 , when the senator began a 21 - hour filibuster in protest of the presidents health care law on the @entity32 floor			1
not knowing that his boss would remain on the floor for such a long time , @entity0 manned the @entity17 feed through the night			0
watching from a tv in his office that broadcast the @entity32 floor proceedings , @entity0 spent the night tweeting @entity10 's best lines			1
@entity10 had mentioned his admiration for how @entity81 had spent part of his filibuster earlier that year to read tweets from supporters			2
so before the speech , @entity0 put out a call on @entity10 's @entity17 account asking people to tweet at his account about @entity234			1
@entity0 printed out the best submissions and ran them to the @entity32 cloak room near the door of the @entity32 , where another staffer picked them up and put it in front of @entity10			1
" @entity234 , " @entity10 said , reading from the tweet on the paper			0
" ai n't nobody got time for that			0
" @entity0 immediately clipped a video of @entity10 reciting that quote — a reference to a popular internet video about a woman who described escaping a fire -- from the @entity32 floor feed , uploaded it to @entity254 and tweeted the quote from @entity10 's official account			1
today , it has nearly 900 retweets			0
@entity0 remembers the moment fondly as his contribution to @entity262 political history			0
" no matter what else happens , ' ai n't nobody got time for that ' is in the congressional record because of lowly ol ' me , " he said			0
it would n't be the last time @entity0 would thrust @entity10 into the pop culture conversation			1
@entity0 is an obsessive @entity9 fan — and yes , this began before she branched out from the country music scene , he 'll have you know — and he uses every opportunity he can to incorporate her into his work			0
in november , @entity10 tweeted an auto - tuned video of @entity278 , the @entity279 professor who helped construct @entity234 , using the beat from @entity9 's " @entity281			2
" during @entity10 's @entity32 campaign , @entity0 made a point to see four @entity9 concerts in @entity5 in less than two months			1
colleagues say he even logs into @entity9 fan message boards , and his personal @entity17 page is full of @entity9 music videos , gifs and photos			0
" i admit i probably like @entity9 more than i should , " he said			0
his adoration seems to be spreading throughout the @entity10 office , where a 2015 @entity9 calendar — courtesy of his colleague , @entity150 -- hangs on the wall			0
in december , the @entity10 staff @entity17 account posted a @entity300 clip from the " @entity301 " music video of @entity9 , dancing in a leotard while singing , " ca n't stop cruising ... " when he 's not thinking of @entity10 or @entity9 , @entity0 's head is in space			1
@entity0 , a self - declared @entity307 geek , originally planned to study aerospace engineering in college , but he switched to political science			2
the shelf near his desk is decorated in toy spaceships that he 's collected over the years , and his personal @entity17 page , beneath the bio , " i like space life is better in @entity317 pardon my @entity5 " is full of pictures of space shuttles ( interspersed between @entity320 and emojis			0
) in early december he even traveled to @entity323 , @entity324 to watch the @entity326 space shuttle launch , which , of course , he live - tweeted			0
@entity0 's space knowledge may come in handy next year , because @entity10 is next in line to be the chairman of the @entity332 and @entity333 subcommittee			1
that , however , may not be the most exciting part about @entity10 's year in 2015			2
@entity10 is considered a possible presidential contender , and if he runs , @entity0 said he believes @entity10 's digital groundwork that has served him so well in @entity5 would be ready to go national			1
" should it go that way , " he said , " we 'd be in a good place to do it			0
" and for that campaign — if it happens -- @entity0 wo n't be anywhere near a steering wheel .			0

26 - year - old @entity0 is the person @entity10 trusts most to speak for him online .
@entity10 is a possible contender for president in 2016 , and the most talked - about politicians on the @entity26 .
