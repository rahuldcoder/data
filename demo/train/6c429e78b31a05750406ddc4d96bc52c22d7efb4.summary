-- the atmosphere is hushed and quiet as about 150 people take their seats			2
they 're each clutching a folder and a tiny @entity7 flag			1
a few whisper about being nervous , but ca n't quite articulate why			2
it 's the ubiquitous butterflies in the stomach that seem to come with any big day , any big decision			2
as big days go , this is one of the biggest			2
all these people are about to become citizens of the @entity7			1
they 'll gain the right to vote , to work certain jobs , to serve on a jury and to run for office			2
in about an hour , at the end of their citizenship ceremony in @entity24 , they 'll officially be @entity7 by choice			1
@entity26 remembers that jittery feeling well			2
she was naturalized in 2000 in @entity29 , where she still lives , and is one of several @entity0 ireporters who spoke about why they chose to become @entity7 citizens			1
" everyone arrived too early and we found ourselves standing and waiting , hardly able to contain our excitement , " she said			2
" everyone seemed to speak at the same time as they shared their stories with one another			2
" there was a soldier from @entity42 , and @entity26 herself , a political refugee from @entity44			1
as a writer with dissenting views , @entity45 said she had been thrown in a @entity49 prison under former dictator @entity50			0
her father showed her a photo of the @entity53 , telling her , " this is the place where freedom lives			0
" after her release , she said she made it to @entity58 and , eventually , to the @entity7 in 1990			1
ten years later , she became a @entity7 citizen			1
" for me , @entity7 citizenship means freedom of expression and to live and work in a free country ... and not have to be afraid of being arrested or harassed because of owning certain common books or pictures , " said @entity45			1
she also feels a sense of responsibility to her adopted country			0
" to be an @entity7 is not just a great honor , but also an obligation to do more and reach higher			1
" naturalized citizen : four reasons why " @entity7 is the best " it has been a long wait in the @entity24 heat for the immigrants waiting to be naturalized this morning			1
the first in line arrived around 8 a.m. for a ceremony that starts at 9:30			0
but this is just the last stretch of the years - long marathon that most of them have been through to become @entity7			1
for most people , it takes at least five years to become a citizen , and that 's after you already have a green card -- permanent residency status -- a process that can take years itself			1
many people at the ceremony have been in the @entity7 for 10 years or more			1
one woman moved here in 1978			0

" i 'm thankful for the opportunity to stay , study and work [ in the @entity7 ] , but it was not free by any means , " said @entity93			1
" the process was a nightmare that never ended : thousands of dollars and many years of fear and hopelessness			2
" would he do it again ? yes , he said			0
even though the @entity7 did n't quite live up to all his expectations -- he feels society judges him based on " race , color , origin , looks and , yes , marital status " ( @entity93 is gay ) -- he still said , " i love you @entity7			1
you 're home at the end			0
" it 's almost time			0
friends and family start to stream in to the ceremony room -- they had to wait until all the candidates for citizenship were seated -- and the atmosphere relaxes a little			0
there are waves and smiles , a few excited babies and children			0
the room is now full with the candidates and their loved ones			0
the cameras start to come out			0
@entity134 is one of those who clicked his camera all during his naturalization ceremony , too			2
he became a citizen in 2007 , having moved to the @entity7 from @entity139 13 years earlier			1
" i 'd just graduated from high school , the political situation in @entity139 was evolving into a multiparty system , the country 's currency had been devalued , the banks were failing , unemployment was at its highest , university officials and professors were constantly on strike , " he said			2
" it was a simple decision			0
" @entity152 : " i am accepted for what i am , not for what i represent " once in the @entity7 , @entity134 earned his @entity155 in computer science and went on to get an mba			1
today , he 's a senior project manager for a large health care company			0
" i do n't know if my achievement could be reversed for an @entity7 moving to @entity139 , " said @entity134			1
three officials approach the podium and the ceremony begins			0
lights are dimmed , and the audience rises as a recording of the national anthem comes over the speakers			0
the officials say 54 countries are represented in today 's naturalization ceremony			2
they list each one , asking the people from said country to rise , and every nationality mentioned is met with applause			0
@entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179 get the loudest cheers			0
everyone is standing now , all their countries ' names having been listed			0
" ladies and gentlemen , please raise your right hand			0
" cameras flash , phones shoot video			0
friends and family of the naturalization candidates surround them in the room , capturing the oath of citizenship			2
they finally finish the lengthy oath and there are claps and cheers			0
they are now @entity7 , citizens of the @entity7			1
many are holding and waving their little @entity7 flags			1
now it 's time to say the @entity206			0
they stand with their hands over their hearts and face the flag			0
" pledging allegiance to the flag was one of the proudest moments of my life , " remembers @entity211 , who attended his own naturalization ceremony in 2005			2
originally from @entity218 , he moved to the @entity7 to be with his wife , who is from @entity220			1
the pair met online and decided to build their new life together in the @entity7			1
@entity224 had a green card , " but that was n't enough for me , " he decided			0
" i believe strongly in the @entity228 of this country and just having the right to work here was n't enough			0
i wanted the right to vote and i wanted the right to call myself @entity7			1
" " no other country gives you the right to pursue happiness , and that is the right that i have grabbed firmly with both hands , " @entity211 said			0
" a lot of people complain about this country ... but try living elsewhere without all the rights that you take for granted			0
in some ways , we immigrants are the lucky ones ; we see more clearly the opportunities that this great nation affords all its people			1
" immigrant : becoming @entity7 does n't mean giving up native culture the citizenship ceremony only takes about 40 minutes in total			1
the new citizens grin as they are each handed their certificate of naturalization			1
most stick around to take photos in front of the large @entity7 flag next to the podium , or a portrait of president @entity264 that is hanging on the wall			1
they proudly display their certificates of naturalization and wave their flags for the camera			2
they 're @entity7 now -- @entity7 by choice .			1

this @entity275 , we ask naturalized citizens why they chose to become @entity7
some wanted a better *education* or career opportunities
others needed to escape political or *economic* turmoil
