-- believe it or not , there are a fair number of people in the " top 1 % " who think that the existing distribution of wealth and opportunity is grotesque			0
they believe that an @entity11 's place in this distribution is too dependent on irrelevant factors ( race , creed , color , etc. ) and relevant ones ( educational attainment , intelligence ) ; that inequality is bad not only because poverty sucks and the wealthy can do more but also because it is corrupting fairness in politics , education , health , national service and employment			1
they think it degrades social relationships , weakens national solidarity and drives the @entity11 down international league tables in important areas			0
and these " rich egalitarians " believe that government can and should do far more to reduce inequality and mitigate its effects			1
@entity37 : the most unequal place in @entity11 @entity40 egalitarians are often accused of weakness by the left for not voluntarily giving up more of their treasure , judged irrational by the right for not giving up their idealism ( in the interest of self - interest ) , and suspected of self - righteous hypocrisy by people who doubt that they sincerely want to reduce an inequality whose fruits they seem to enjoy very much			1
despite these attacks , for the last 20 years , it 's been pretty easy for rich egalitarians to live by following this simple playbook : in politics , vote for @entity56 , support progressive policies yet still sleep easy ( though with some guilt ) in the knowledge that even when @entity56 are in power no policy truly hostile to the economic interests of the rich can pass ( e.g. the @entity63 or some other mechanism to tax capital gains sensibly and the " carried interest " earned by investment managers ) ; gnash teeth when the @entity69 are in power ; generally ignore state and local politics			1
in philanthropy , give significant money and time to organizations working domestically with disadvantaged people or providing public goods available to everyone			0
in personal matters , eschew ostentation and the cloistered world of private planes and country clubs ; live a normal upper middle - class life , in a liberal city , of parks , subways and economy - class travel ( but private school for the children )			0
in business , remain committed to the core public / private division of labor where private markets , technology and business provide innovation , efficiency and effectiveness while the government redistributes otherwise excessive outcomes ( through taxation and income support ) , mitigates ill effects ( through regulation ) and provides " public " goods such as education , parks , public transportation and health care as well as the core functions of the " watchman " state ( contract enforcement , rule of law , national security )			0
opinion : mobility , not income inequality , is the problem but across the board , rich egalitarians are being tested			1
in politics , the emergence of the populist left poses a dilemma			0
although they share some common policy ground , egalitarians believe in fairness ( everyone doing what they reasonably can and should ) while populists believe in taking ( from those fat cats )			2
and remarkably , some populists seem to believe that we live in a neo-agrarian economy where the poor are poor because the rich are rich , whereas egalitarians see broader structural causes			1
and rich egalitarians , while acknowledging that part of the policy remedy will require the rich become considerably poorer , also think it will require a long - term commitment to investments in education , health care , infrastructure and the other public goods			2
@entity148 : @entity150 's 85 richest own as much as the poorest 50 % so in @entity151 , where rich egalitarians were originally heartened by new mayor @entity153 's early focus on inequality , they now worry , given the tone of the inauguration , that he may prove to be a populist in egalitarian clothing who asks the wealthy , rightly , to do their fair share ( higher taxes to expand affordable housing and pre-k ) without asking others to do the same ( reforming arcane work rules and unsustainable benefits for public sector unions , etc. )			1
and it is easy to imagine something similar at the federal level if tax rates on the wealthy were increased without any of the structural changes -- increasing the total tax base , investing in public goods , curbing the growth in entitlements -- required to create a more egalitarian , yet fiscally sustainable , society			2
of course even rich egalitarians ca n't fully embrace a populist movement whose defining narrative tars the wealthy as villains , but should they nevertheless support the populists because of the short - term policy overlap , or abandon them on principle ? in philanthropy , charities clamor more than ever for support while pundits tell the wealthy to discard " band - aid charity " to focus on " solving " problems through various types of " impact " investing ( where they might also make a buck )			1
but if charity is out and problem solving is in , should n't " merely wealthy " egalitarians cede that terrain to @entity201 , @entity63 and other @entity203 billionaires with the individual resources to make a difference ? in personal life , the " normal " option -- just fine in the past -- continues to be hollowed out to make room for an ever - expanding set of gold and platinum tiers that are becoming the norm not only in credit cards and air travel but everywhere ( $ 315/hour @entity217 anyone ? )			2
worse yet , the bar rises each year with respect to what wealthy children see as " normal " given the increasingly perverse lengths to which many parents will go in the attempt to lock in high socioeconomic status by turning their children 's lives into grueling , yet luxurious , 17 - year , all - expenses paid , @entity230 applications			2
does the commitment of rich egalitarians to a " normal " life require explicit acts of self - sacrifice and restraint on a daily basis ? and in business , the debacles of the last decade -- gun control , insider trading , the financial crisis , @entity242 , etc. -- force rich egalitarians to question whether their commitment to markets / technology / business has become anachronistic in an era where business seems incapable of self - regulation while relentlessly absorbing hitherto public goods and defeating even sensible efforts at regulation			0
( and in the absence of campaign finance reform , rich nonegalitarians are now free to use their de facto control of corporate assets to fight against redistribution on the personal side as well			0
) but since rich egalitarians ca n't abandon the commitment to the market ( rich egalitarians are not socialists ) , should they pin their hopes on nascent forms of " social enterprise " that are far from proving they can deliver the goods ? how will rich egalitarians respond to these challenges ? a few will ride the tide to become self - loathing populists			1
others will give up their egalitarianism and retreat to bucolic suburbs where they 're less likely to have awkward run - ins with old friends or feel picked on by the mayor			0
but i hope most discover that their convictions prove up to the challenge ; that they 'll explore new avenues of impact investing in addition to , not in lieu of , charity ; that they 'll continue to live in the city , ride the subway and fly coach ; and that they 'll engage with the populists despite their differences , showing them that the rich are n't so bad , arguing strenuously for sustainable fairness , not opportunistic taking , paying newly higher taxes without complaint and serving as a fifth column within the ranks of the wealthy to help the city and nation take at least baby steps in the direction that they 've always claimed it should go			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity308 .			0

@entity308 : @entity40 egalitarians are being tested as never before
he says those 1 *percenters* who oppose inequality do n't share views of populists
@entity317 : poor are n't poor because the rich are rich ; there are structural causes
he says wealthy should pay more in taxes but as part of a plan to invest in society 's *future*
