never underestimate the capacity of the @entity1 to shoot itself in both feet			2
" breath - taking , " " staggering , " " @entity4			0
" just some of the adjectives we could use to describe the latest @entity1 fiasco where the troika -- made up of the @entity10 , the @entity11 and the @entity12 -- has managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory			2
the decision to " bail - in " depositors in @entity18 -- to make ordinary people pay for the mistakes of the banks -- is extraordinary			1
nothing like this was done in @entity25 , @entity26 or @entity27			0
why , oh why , it should be up to the @entity18 to test drive this dangerous and maverick policy remains unknown			2
to be sure , the presence of large @entity32 and offshore funds in @entity18 banks is cause for a different format than those used in other peripheral countries			1
for example , you could not realistically have the money of @entity42 housewives bailing out @entity32 oligarchs			1
there were more sophisticated and rapier like ways to achieve the same goal , taxing deposits under € 100,000 at over 6 % is effectively punishing the @entity18 people			1
cypriots are already going to feel the ferocity from the effects of a recession caused by lower wages and high unemployment , they do not need the additional confiscatory measures of their deposits being taken			0
once again the @entity1 has shown it is better at creating crises than confronting them			1
in the past few hours , i 've spoken to bank ceos and top economists			0
words like " great mistake " and " disastrous " are being used			0
so far i have not spoken to anyone who thinks this is a good idea			0
at all levels , for depositors , future foreign investors and @entity1 policy , the decision on tiny @entity18 is going to have huge ramifications .			1
