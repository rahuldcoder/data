-- the disclosure saturday by @entity3 authorities that milk and spinach have shown higher - than - normal levels of radiation contamination has raised concerns about food safety and supplies in one of @entity3 's most heavily populated regions			1
tainted milk was found 30 kilometers ( 18 1/2 miles ) from the @entity15 nuclear plant and spinach was collected as far as 100 kilometers ( 65 miles ) to the south , almost halfway to @entity17			1
the plant was badly damaged after a 9.0 earthquake and subsequent tsunami hit the coast on march 11			0
but chief cabinet secretary @entity22 stressed to reporters saturday afternoon that the levels were not extremely high : a person who consumed these products continuously for a year , he said , would take in the same amount of radiation as that of a single ct scan			0
the @entity31 said that equates to 7 millisieverts , more than double the 3 millisieverts that a person in an industrialized country is typically exposed to in a year			0
health effects would become more evident , he said , if such products were taken in daily for a lifetime			0
@entity22 said high radiation levels were not systemic for all spinach and milk tested , and that more data would be collected and analyzed under the @entity3 health ministry 's watch to help determine what steps to take next			1
the @entity15 prefecture , or province , is just to the northeast of @entity17			1
according to the prefecture 's website , @entity15 plays an important role in supplying food , not only to @entity17 , but also to the nation			2
the prefecture is @entity3 's fourth - largest farmland area and ranks among the top producer of fruits , vegetables , rice , tobacco and raw silk			1
the favorable climate lends itself to an active agricultural industry that includes livestock farming			0
the website also states that the prefecture 's 159 kilometer - long coastline is home to a thriving fishing and seafood processing industry , and the area 's haul of fish is among @entity3 's largest			1
neighboring @entity76 prefecture supplies @entity17 with a significant amount of fruits and vegetables			2
@entity76 is the largest producer of @entity81 melons in @entity3 , according to the prefecture 's website , as well as the country 's third - largest producer of pork			1
the impact on rice production in the area is also a source of concern			0
@entity91 is @entity3 's largest crop			1
rice paddies account for 55 % of @entity3 's farmland , and about 85 % of the 2.3 million farms in @entity3 plant rice annually			1
while the value of the rice industry relative to the national economy has declined in recent years , rice production is culturally significant and an important part of @entity3 heritage			2
@entity15 prefecture contributed 4.5 % of @entity3 's total rice production in 2010			1
@entity76 prefecture is the country 's second - largest producer of @entity108 , a gourmet variety of rice			1
according to the @entity112 , @entity3 's rice - growing season starts in april ( depending on the region ) and this year 's crop could remain unaffected , depending on how much radiation is released and in which direction , as well as how long it takes to clear farmland of contaminated soil			1
@entity122 , @entity0 consultant and international security expert at the @entity124 , warned that should a reactor suffer a meltdown and radiation reach ground water , the situation would be much worse , as it would be impossible to tell where the contamination starts and stops			0
so , how does food become contaminated ? according to the @entity137 , the surface of foods like fruits and vegetables or animal feed can become radioactive by the deposit of radioactive materials falling on it from the air or through rainwater			2
over time , radioactivity can also build up within food , as radionuclides are transferred through soil into crops or animals ( and thereby tainting milk ) , or into rivers , lakes and the sea , where fish and shellfish could take up the radionuclides			2
radionuclides are elements in an unstable form that emit radiation			0
the severity of the risk depends on the radionuclide mix and the level of contaminant released			0
the health organization says packaged food is not susceptible to radiation contamination as long as the food is sealed			0
the organization warned that " food contaminated with radioactive material will not appear spoiled , but consuming such food will increase the amount of radioactivity a person is exposed to and could increase the health risks associated with exposure			0
" it went on to recommend that people avoid consumption of locally produced vegetables and milk , as well as fishing , hunting and slaughtering animals			2
as of right now , @entity3 appears to have adequate stockpiles of staples such as rice , but getting food to some of the hardest - hit regions is proving difficult			2
if current radiation levels hold , the farming community , while affected , could be spared			0
with the situation being so fluid , however , it 's impossible to tell what impact this disaster will have on an already devastated population .			0

the @entity15 province is the top producer of fruits , vegetables , rice
its fish haul is among @entity3 's largest
