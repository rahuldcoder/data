@entity0 -- @entity2 announced on december 12 the trial and execution of @entity5 , former vice chairman of the powerful @entity6 and uncle to @entity9 leader @entity8			1
although @entity8 has already purged hundreds of officials during his two year reign , @entity5 's ouster is highly unusual , even by @entity9 standards			1
@entity5 is married to the sister of the late leader @entity15 and it had been expected he would be safe from a purge until after her death			2
in the past , when members of the @entity9 senior leadership strata were purged , they usually simply stopped appearing in @entity9 media			1
instead , the @entity23 and other media reports showed that @entity5 was first erased from existing official photos and videos in tactics reminiscent of the stalin - era @entity28			2
@entity9 stability fears after execution @entity5 was arrested during a special meeting of the leadership with the photos and lengthy list of his crimes promulgated to the @entity9 public			1
that @entity5 was executed was also rare for someone in the inner circle of power			2
while @entity8 is emulating the power politics of his father and grandfather , he has taken it to new levels of brutality			0
in addition to @entity5 -- previously referred to as the " second most powerful man in @entity9 , " @entity8 replaced both the minister of defense and chairman of the general staff			1
clearly , no one is safe from @entity8 's wrath			1
according to @entity56 media reports , @entity53 , the vice minister of the army , was executed last year per @entity8 's dictate to leave " no trace of him , not even his hair , " though it is not clear exactly how he was killed			1
some reports suggest he was executed with a mortar round during the official mourning period after @entity15 's death			0
@entity5 -- the " despicable human scum who was worse than a dog " -- was accused of plotting a coup to " overthrow the state [ and ] to grab the supreme power of our party and state			2
but had @entity5 wanted to grab the ring of power he would have had more success immediately after @entity8 's father 's death in december 2011 , before his son acquired the six titles conferring power over the state , party , and military			1
how @entity8 got rid of his uncle it is more likely that the accusation of treason -- as well as the litany of his personal foibles of gambling , drugs , womanizing , pornography , and drinking -- were to undermine @entity5 's reputation and justify the execution			1
an uncle 's ambition cut short the young @entity8 also used the purge to make @entity5 the scapegoat for @entity9 's economic problems			1
@entity5 was described as controlling all major economic fields of the country and accused of scheming " to drive the economy of the country and people 's living into an uncontrollable catastrophe			2
" @entity5 was then able to be blamed for the disastrous currency revaluation of 2009 , poor construction in @entity2 , selling off of the @entity112 economic zone and precious resources at low prices , and creating " a great confusion in financial management system of the state			0
" so much for the political and economic reform that some experts predicted @entity8 would implement , as they had similarly predicted about his father			0
@entity5 's accusation emphasized the " the unitary leadership ( and ) absolute authority " of @entity8			1
" the military court derided @entity5 's " despicable true colors as ( economic ) reformist known to the outside world			1
" @entity5 's " cunning and sinister means " were compared with the " strategic patience policy and waiting strategy of the @entity131 and the south @entity9 puppet group of traitors			1
" if there was any lingering naive doubt that @entity8 would be just as merciless as his father and grandfather , it died along with @entity5			2
during his two years in power , he has escalated the subjugation of the populace			0
he has increased public executions , expanded the gulags for political prisoners , and increased government punishment for people caught with information from the outside world			0
photos show scale of @entity9 's repressive prison camps earlier this year , @entity8 showed that he is willing to go even higher than his father in raising tension on the @entity154			1
@entity2 threatened @entity131 military bases in the wider region with nuclear attacks			0
he also warned of tactical attacks on @entity56 targets			0
he defied @entity161 resolutions by conducting nuclear and long - range missile launches and was credited by the official @entity9 media as being the mastermind behind @entity2 's two deadly attacks on @entity56 in 2010			2
threats of annihilation normal for @entity56 the @entity131 should have no illusions about @entity8			0
his government vows it will never abandon its nuclear weapons and @entity2 continues to augment and refine its nuclear and missile arsenals			0
@entity56 's minister of defense believes @entity2 's missiles can already reach the continental @entity131			0
the @entity9 threat -- always high -- has gotten worse under the young leader			0
he is just as dangerous as his father -- and less predictable			0
the opinions expressed in this article are solely those of @entity181 .			0
