-- you 've built a cannon			1
now you just need a willing participant to crawl inside			2
@entity5 's uncle always seemed like a bit of " a mad scientist			1
" and growing up next door to him in @entity10 , @entity11 , she did n't think much of the fact he was building a giant cannon in his basement			1
that was just @entity18 , a math teacher and trained gymnast who was so fascinated by circus cannons , he went ahead and made one			2
then he fired himself , his two children , and his niece out of it			1
it was the beginnings of one of the world 's most remarkable human cannonball families			2
@entity30 is celebrated for such spectacular stunts as being fired over the @entity33 border			1
while son @entity34 holds the world record for the highest shot in the air , a whopping 26 meters			2
cannonball couple but the cannon is more than simply an unusual career choice for niece @entity5 , who today goes by the stage name " @entity42			1
" it 's how she met her husband @entity45 , better known as " @entity46 " who blasted into the sky at the @entity49			1
for over two decades the cannonball couple , now in their 40s , have traveled the globe shooting each other into the blue yonder			2
it 's a nomadic lifestyle , and they currently live in @entity58 with their two daughters , working with the @entity60			0
where they could be called to perform next , is anyone 's guess			0
but @entity45 is used to the giddy heights -- he is the fifth generation of a flying trapeze family from @entity68			1
that 's how he met @entity5			1
" he was a trapeze artist in the same circus show as my cousin , " she explained			0
" we fell in love and wanted to do something on our own			0
" that special something was cannonballing , and the loved - up teenagers enlisted the help of @entity30 to build them a five - meter - long aluminum and stainless steel cannon , which @entity5 still uses to this day			1
force of nature seeing @entity5 flying through the air in her luminous catsuit , red helmet gleaming like a candy @entity87 , she appears like a retro superhero zooming 12 meters above the gasping crowd below			1
yet even after all these years she still finds the experience nerve wracking			0
why does she do it ? " the actual flight , free flying through the air with nothing attached to you , is amazing , " she says			0
there 's no denying it 's an awesome spectacle			0
but not one without serious injuries and fatalities , including a man who died in the @entity102 in 2011 when his safety net collapsed			0
before @entity5 slides down the barrel , there are landing calculations to be done , and sand - filled dummies to be test launched			1
" people do n't realize how much time it takes preparing , taking into consideration things like the weather , the humidity , temperature , wind , and doing your math formulas correctly , " said @entity5 , who must land flat on her back in the middle of a giant air - filled target			1
" i use an airbag , so i have an electric fan that fills it with air			0
that means the electricity has to be very safe and secure and no one can unplug it -- which has happened to me before			0
" luckily for @entity5 , someone plugged in the fan again just in time			1
staring down the barrel showmanship is a huge part of the performance , and seeing @entity5 work the crowd before the big bang , is a bit like witnessing the dramatic entrance of a wrestler before a fight			1
but after she slides down the darkened barrel , just what goes on inside ? " you have to make sure that you have every muscle tight , and your neck and spine aligned , " she explained			0
" you have to be completely up against the mechanism that fires you through the air -- because if you 're away from it , or not ready , or your body is loose , then it would be like being hit by a semi truck			0
" the shorter the barrel , the more violent the impact , meaning @entity5 tends to take more of a blow than @entity45 in his 10 - meter - long cannon			1
" you could never in your wildest dreams imagine the kind of impact it takes to fire you out of a cannon , " she says			2
your take - off is in the blink of an eye			0
you go from nothing to 80 kilometers per hour			2
" trade secret when it comes to explaining how the cannon works though , @entity5 is less forthcoming			1
" it 's a trade secret , " she said			0
" it 's not just our family , but all human cannonballs are pretty secretive			1
" that said , the only gunpowder you 're likely to find in modern cannons is in creating the bang and puff of smoke			0
instead , compressed air or a bungee cord are used to propel a small platform -- which launches the performer sky high			0
but the gasp - inducing performance seems to have lost none of its magic , with audience members telling @entity5 after the show : " it was the best six seconds of my life			2
" does that mean she and @entity45 will be encouraging their children to also enter the trade ? " no , i do n't think so , " she says with a nervous laugh			2
" i 'd like them to remember their cannonball parents -- but that does n't mean i want them to be ones themselves			0
" inspire : for $ 150k you could be @entity205 learn : @entity207 's incredible circus contortionists			0
