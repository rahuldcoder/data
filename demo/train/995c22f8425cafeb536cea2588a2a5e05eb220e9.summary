@entity0 -- @entity3 sources say they 're in a @entity5 situation on how to reply to senate majority leader @entity7 's claims that @entity9 presidential candidate @entity8 went 10 years without paying taxes			1
they understand that they 're taking @entity7 's bait and that responding to his unsubstantiated claims against @entity8 keeps alive the issue of @entity8 's refusing to release his tax returns			1
still , these @entity9 sources say they feel that if they do not respond to such a serious charge from such a high - ranking @entity18 , it will look like a tacit admission @entity7 is right			1
republicans stepped up attempts to undermine @entity7 's unsubstantiated allegations monday , saying @entity7 and other @entity23 ' accusations are being orchestrated by president @entity25 's campaign -- specifically his senior campaign adviser , @entity26			1
to that end , @entity28 spokesman @entity27 noted that @entity26 visited @entity23 for their weekly lunch last tuesday			0
later that afternoon , a @entity32 story was published with @entity7 's allegations about the presumptive @entity9 nominee not paying any taxes			1
opinion : why wo n't @entity8 release more tax returns ? " you 've got to wonder if the so - called source is @entity26 himself , " @entity27 said			2
" hours after meeting with @entity26 , @entity7 comes out and makes baseless accusations ? " @entity26 flatly denied that allegation , calling it " completely false " and saying he " never had any such discussion			1
" " instead of pointing fingers in every direction , they can put the whole matter to rest by simply observing the standard @entity48 and a generation of candidates have set by releasing the returns , " @entity26 said			0
in a separate article posted monday , the @entity32 reported that it interviewed @entity7 days before @entity26 's visit , making any influence from the top @entity25 official 's @entity55 visit impossible			2
by trying to tie @entity7 's remarks to the @entity25 campaign , @entity3 are trying to hit democrats where it could hurt most : the president 's credibility			1
that comes after the @entity9 response to @entity7 got increasingly hostile and personal over the weekend			1
" i 'm not going to respond to a dirty liar who has n't filed a single page of tax returns himself ( and ) complains about people with money but lives in the @entity74 here down the street , " @entity28 chairman @entity65 said on @entity66			0
" and the fact that we 're going to spend any time talking about it is ridiculous			0
" sen. @entity80 of @entity81 also used the " l " word to describe @entity7 's statements , which were repeated on the @entity23 floor later in the week , saying the majority leader is " making things up			1
" " what he did on the floor of the @entity23 is so out of bounds			0
i think he 's lying about his statement , of knowing something about @entity8 , " @entity80 said sunday on @entity1 's " @entity90			2
" @entity9 convention roles revealed as for @entity7 , he tried to turn the focus right back to where he wants it			1
" this whole issue is not about me , " @entity7 said in his home state of @entity98 on monday			2
" @entity8 's the first presidential candidate since his dad ran not to release his income tax returns			2
he 's released one income tax return , and that points toward the @entity105 , @entity106 and a few other foreign countries			0
this whole controversy will end very quickly if he releases his income tax returns , like everybody else has done			0
" @entity8 has released his tax return from 2010 and an estimate from 2011			2
he has vowed to release his full 2011 return once it 's completed , but he will not release past years ' , as previous presidential candidates have done			0
meanwhile , @entity7 chief of staff @entity114 insisted monday , again , that he knows who @entity7 's source is -- and that the source is credible			1
" i know who this person is , and if i thought this person was not credible , i would say something to sen. @entity7			0
i would try to shut it down			0
this person is credible , " @entity114 said			0
" this person has asked @entity7 to protect the confidentiality of this person , but it 's real , " he continued			2
" this person told him this			0
this person said it to sen. @entity7			0
" multiple @entity134 sources insist that @entity7 made the allegations against @entity8 on his own but also admit the @entity25 campaign is not telling him to back off			1
sources close to @entity7 say he knew full well he would be challenged by @entity3 and the media for accusing @entity8 of not paying taxes for 10 years but not offering any proof			1
but these sources say @entity7 did n't care -- in fact , he was eager to do it			2
growing up impoverished in a trailer with no running water in @entity146 , @entity98 , @entity7 literally fought his way out as a boxer			0
as a politician , he has never been afraid to punch below the belt , especially when he dislikes someone personally , and by all accounts @entity7 has a strong personal disregard for @entity8			1
@entity25 debuts ' @entity154 ' through the years he has called president @entity155 a loser and a liar , named then - @entity159 chairman @entity158 a political hack and gone after sen. @entity161 during the 2008 presidential race as someone too temperamental to be president			0
but @entity3 say this time , @entity7 took it too far , not only because he wo n't back up his accusation beyond citing a confidential source but because he chose to attack @entity8 on the issue from the @entity23 floor			1
@entity8 himself pushed back against @entity7 's accusations twice last week , insisting that he has paid a lot of money in taxes -- and telling the majority leader to either " put up or shut up			1
" @entity1 's @entity176 contributed to this report .			0

senate majority leader @entity7 says @entity8 went 10 years without paying taxes
@entity3 push back against @entity7 's unsubstantiated claims , calling him a liar
@entity9 sources say they know they 're playing into @entity7 's hands by responding but feel they must
@entity7 often pulls no punches when going after an *opponent* , especially one he dislikes
