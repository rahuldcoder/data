-- an analysis of the sickest swine flu patients in @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 , and @entity6 suggests that relatively healthy adolescents and young adults are among the most likely to get very sick after an h1n1 infection , a pattern similar to that seen in the 1918 influenza pandemic			1
the most important message is that children should get the @entity17 vaccination , dr. @entity13 said			2
almost all critically ill patients in the studies were sick for only a few days before rapidly progressing to more severe symptoms and respiratory failure , which required treatment with a breathing machine , according to three studies published in the @entity25			0
the mortality rate ranged from 14.3 percent to 41.4 percent , depending on the country			1
the findings may help shine some light on what the 2009 @entity17 flu season may bring , and who may be hit the hardest by the swine flu during the next few months			1
" these studies are telling us that young people are at risk for bad complications of @entity17 and under usual circumstances , [ seasonal ] flu does not cause acute respiratory failure in younger people , " says dr. @entity13 , the medical director of the respiratory care department at @entity36 , in @entity37 , and the author of @entity40 's guide to @entity41 and @entity42			1
the analysis of cases in @entity3 and @entity6 looked at people who developed severe acute respiratory distress syndrome ( a condition in which the lungs fill with fluid ) and were put on a life - support system known as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( @entity62 )			0
this artificial heart and lung machine system , which puts oxygen into the blood and then carries this blood to the body tissues , is considered risky and expensive ; as a result , it is not readily available in every hospital			0
the mortality rate was 21 percent for these patients , although it may have been higher without this treatment , the authors say			1
@entity0 : 8 ways swine flu is changing society " these studies provide important signals about what clinicians and hospitals may confront in the coming months , " dr. @entity79 , and dr. @entity80 , of the @entity81 , write in an editorial accompanying the new studies			0
in young , healthy patients , @entity17 can quickly cause respiratory failure that ca n't necessarily be reversed with mechanical ventilation , although such patients are not currently a priority group for @entity17 vaccination , they note			1
in the @entity4 study , about 30 percent to 40 percent of the patients had lung disease , were obese , or had high blood pressure , a history of smoking , or diabetes			2
overall , 14.3 percent of 168 critically ill people with confirmed or suspected @entity17 died within 28 days			1
the mortality rate in the @entity5 study was strikingly higher			1
in @entity107 , where the @entity17 pandemic was first reported , 41.4 percent of 58 critically ill people died within 60 days of developing the flu			1
@entity0 : 10 best big cities for people with asthma those people who died from @entity17 got sicker earlier in the course of their illness , had extremely low levels of oxygen in their blood , and had multiple organ failure			1
their average age was 44 years old , and 54 of 58 patients needed mechanical ventilation			2
other signs of more severe @entity17 included fever and severe trouble breathing			2
@entity0 : 10 ways you put yourself at risk for swine flu ( without realizing it ! ) in the @entity4 study ( in which the average age was 21.4 ) , the critically ill tended to be hospitalized within four days of developing flu symptoms , and there was about a one - day lapse between hospital admission to intensive care unit ( @entity140 ) admission			0
as in the @entity107 study , younger patients with low blood oxygen and multisystem organ failure were hardest hit			0
what 's more , the critically ill tended to require mechanical ventilation and rescue therapies to aid in breathing			0
@entity0 : 8 causes of chronic cough in both countries , the @entity17 outbreak lasted about three months			2
" it is not clear of hospitals ' need to invest in this @entity62 technology because this has not proven very successful in other respiratory illnesses , " says @entity13			0
" we do know that treating @entity17 with antivirals such as @entity161 ( oseltamivir ) and @entity163 ( zanamivir ) did help improve mortality			1
" the most important message is that children should get the @entity17 vaccination , which is safe , he says			2
" the technology for making swine flu vaccine is no different than that used to make the regular flu vaccine , so in principle , there should be no differences in terms of safety , " he explains			0
" recent surveys have shown that @entity180 are iffy about whether they will let their children receive this novel vaccine			0
" dr. @entity183 , the director of @entity184 at the @entity185 , in @entity186 , @entity187 , notes that the studies focused on the sickest of the sick patients			0
@entity0 : 7 surprising triggers of lung trouble " the mortality rate can be high for a small subset of people , but the overall death rate is closer to seasonal flu than the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( @entity199 ) outbreak of 2003 , " he says			1
" this is a serious flu and there is mortality , but it is about the same as with the seasonal flu -- maybe a little worse			1
" as to why younger people seem to be hit hardest , the current school of thought is that perhaps a similar virus circulated 50 or 60 years ago , so older people could have immunity to @entity17			1
@entity183 's advice ? " definitely get the vaccine , " he says			0
( he says his own children have already received the @entity17 vaccination			0
) the editorialists write that the burden is on the public health system to heed the warnings in the new studies and prepare for the coming flu season : " any deaths from 2009 influenza a ( @entity17 ) will be regrettable , but those that result from insufficient planning and inadequate preparation will be especially tragic			2
" such planning should include widespread availability of antivirals , antibiotics , and mechanical ventilation systems			0

in sickest h1n1 patients , mortality rate ranged from 14.3 percent to 41.4 percent
overall death rate is closer to seasonal flu than @entity199 , **doctor** says
older people could have immunity to @entity17 because of virus 50 to 60 years ago
**doctor** : " definitely get the vaccine "
