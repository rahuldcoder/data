@entity0 -- the @entity6 military 's @entity4 will practice protecting the @entity6 from a simulated @entity8 missile attack next month in an exercise using the agency 's newest missile - killing technology , @entity3 officials said friday			1
previous tests have been focused on a missile trajectory that mimics an attack from @entity15 , but the january test will have a trajectory and distance resembling an intercontinental ballistic missile launch from @entity8			1
at the same time , the agency will be testing its new " @entity22 " technology , with upgraded software and sensors loaded inside an interceptor missile that will be fired at the fake @entity8 missile			1
the capability - 2 technology is designed to eventually replace the existing hardware the @entity6 has in its two missile defense bases in @entity30 and @entity31 , according to @entity32 , a spokesman for the @entity4			2
while intelligence assessments of that country 's capabilities now suggest an @entity8 icbm threat is as far away as 2020 , this test was planned more than three years ago , when the threat seemed much closer , @entity32 said			2
in the january test , the fake icbm is slated to originate from the @entity4 's launch facility in the @entity40 in the @entity41 while the interceptor missile will be launched from @entity43 in @entity30 , according to @entity32			1
missile defense tests have been likened to hitting a bullet with a bullet			0
this test will be even more difficult : it will be like hitting a bullet head - on with another bullet , because any launch from @entity8 would have a trajectory that would require a @entity6 interceptor missile hitting the target directly , @entity32 said			1
the missiles will be flying at speeds of between 17,000 and 18,000 miles per hour , according to @entity32 , about 3,000 mph faster than tests involving mock @entity15 missiles			2
the speed will reduce the strike window , meaning the interceptor , also known as the " kill vehicle , " will have to work even faster at identifying and striking the target missile			0
the @entity6 has only two missile defense bases , one at @entity43 , with three missiles , and the other at @entity66 , @entity31 , with 20 interceptor missiles at the ready			0
@entity32 said that if @entity8 were to launch an @entity70 attack against the @entity6 , the most likely defense option would be firing a missile from @entity31 , because of the shorter distance around the globe			0
the @entity6 was prepared to put a third missile defense site in eastern @entity75 , but the @entity77 administration scrapped that option because of the reduced icbm threat from @entity8			0
in its place , the administration said it will move ships with the capability of shooting down short - and medium - range missile from @entity8 which , they say , pose a greater threat to @entity8 's neighbors and @entity6 bases in the @entity88 .			0

previous tests have been focused on a trajectory that mimics a @entity15 attack
this test is made more difficult by the different trajectory of the *incoming* missile
in the january test , fake icbm will be launched from the @entity40
interceptor missile will be launched from @entity30 , agency spokesman says
