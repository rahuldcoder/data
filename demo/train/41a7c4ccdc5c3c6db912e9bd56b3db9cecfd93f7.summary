-- my father was murdered			1
shot down on the street in @entity4 in the 70s			1
i never had a chance to know him			2
his name was @entity10 , and he was in his 20s when he was killed			2
my grandmother , his mother , fell apart after he died			2
he was her only child			2
but kids are curious , regardless of the pain their questions may cause grown - ups			2
i always wanted to know more about my father			1
my mother was n't talking			0
so at 9 years old , i asked my grandmother to tell me about my dad			0
the first thing she did was show me photos of her son stretched out in his coffin with bullet holes in his head			0
house speaker @entity28 and those who support unrestricted gun rights should take a long look at photos like this -- or talk , just once , to mothers who 've lost loved ones to gun violence -- before they utter one word about gun control laws			1
the experience does n't have to change their position , but i guarantee it will help shape their perspectives and permit more intelligent conversations on the issue			1
staring at those photographs , i was horrified			0
i had nightmares for years about getting shot in the head myself , or what my father thought about as he was dying			1
my grandmother only saw the handsome , charismatic young man her son once was			0
fortunately for me , i have since seen photos of him in happier times : as a chubby baby boy ; smiling with his prom date			0
who knew why my grandmother showed me			0
maybe she wanted me to see the violence that took his life			0
or what guns do when not used responsibly			0
i know she wanted the person who killed her son caught and punished			0
coming from this tragic place has given me an awesome respect and healthy fear of guns			0
i know how one shot can change lives forever			1
in my 40 - plus years , hardly a day has gone by that i have n't thought about my father and missed the man i never knew			1
opinion : gun control is on all of us i have lived in a city for the past 25 years , where always i assume anyone can be armed at any time in any place			1
and i grew up in @entity77 , where is it common to hear gunshots echoing through the woods and see a gutted deer carcass hanging from a tree draining blood			0
despite my father 's violent death , i vigorously support our right to bear arms			1
honestly , i 've seen collector guns that are beautiful pieces of craftsmanship			0
and i 'm quite convinced that if i ever felt my or my son 's life was in danger , i 'd use a gun to protect us both from harm			1
i pray that i will never have to make that decision			0
guns are a part of my world			0
and it was the unanswered questions about my father 's murder , in part , that drove me to become a journalist			1
i was determined to write about people like my father whose stories would never be told			1
i 've spoken to neighbors , athletes and colleagues , those who own guns and those who never have , about the gun issue , and all seem to fall in the middle			1
so , i do n't quite buy the hard line we 're told exists between those @entity118 for and against gun control			1
we are not as far apart as @entity120 or lobbyists would have us believe			0
none of the people i 've spoken to think like gun - crazed @entity125 lobbyists or gun - hating liberals			2
real life is never black and white			0
the time has come for @entity118 to take over this conversation and demand sensible solutions that help keep us safe while protecting our constitutional rights			1
we are smart enough to do both : to understand that gun ownership comes with huge responsibility			2
not everyone is qualified to own or have access to guns , just as not all of us are qualified to drive a car , without some regulation			0
as president @entity141 said earlier this week in his news conference : " with rights comes responsibility			1
" it 's common sense , he said			0
as predicted , the backlash has begun over the president 's executive orders , which call for strengthening current gun laws and taking related steps on mental health and school safety			2
he also called on @entity120 to reinstate an assault weapons ban that expired in 2004 , to restrict ammunition magazines to no more than 10 rounds and to expand background checks to anyone buying a gun , whether at a store or in a private sale at an auction or convention			2
the president has begun a much - needed , difficult conversation			1
@entity120 should come up with its own common - sense solutions to curb gun violence if it does n't like what 's on the table			1
to do nothing would be a national disgrace			0
do we really want to live in fear of one another , praying our gun is bigger than the next person 's , or that we are quick enough to shoot first ? there is no common sense in those gun - happy solutions			1
@entity179 has come for us all to stop politicians and lobbyists from turning our great democracy into a nation where it is easier to buy a gun than to exercise our right to vote			2
somehow , i think our forefathers had something greater in mind for us when they wrote the @entity191			0
we owe it to them , our children , our mothers and our fathers to try and live up to those great expectations			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity200 .			1

@entity200 says her father was shot to death in the 1970s
she says if **leaders** opposed to gun control saw *victims* , their perspective might change
she says she backs right to bear arms ; @entity118 not so far apart on issue
@entity214 : @entity141 has started needed conversation ; **leaders** must offer sensible solutions
