thousands of @entity0 are now in line to receive part of a $ 3.4 billion settlement with the federal government , ending a long - running dispute over government mismanagement of tribal lands and accounts			1
after an initial agreement was outlined in 2009 , @entity9 approved it in november 2010 and it spent the last two years going through an appeals process			0
it was finalized saturday , with government officials announcing and touting it on monday			1
" i welcome the final approval of the @entity18 settlement agreement , clearing the way for reconciliation between the trust beneficiaries and the federal government , " president @entity14 said in a statement			1
the settlement is named after the late @entity24 , a member of @entity26 's @entity25			0
the deal follows a class - action lawsuit , filed in 1996 , which accused the @entity30 @entity29 of failing to account for and provide revenue from a trust fund representing the value of @entity35 assets managed by the government			0
the missing funds at the center of the class - action case involve what are called @entity42 accounts , which are supposed to represent the property of individual @entity0			2
the accounts are held by the @entity30 as trustee			0
the lawsuit had accused the government of failing to account for the money , failing to make proper payments , and converting tribal money for the government 's own use			0
in making the announcement monday , @entity14 remembered @entity24 for " her honorable work			2
" in 2009 , she said that many represented in the class - action lawsuit " subsist in the direst poverty , " and that the settlement is " significantly less than the full amount to which the @entity0 are owed			1
" " it 's not fair , " @entity24 said then of the long process to reach a settlement , but " in the future we may be treated more fairly			0
" the agreement calls for $ 1.5 billion to be distributed among those who were part of the lawsuit			1
another $ 1.9 billion will go into a " land consolidation program " that will allow people to sell fractions of land they own , which are slivers of once larger ancestral plots that have been divided and subdivided over generations			1
the group ownership of land by @entity0 dates back more than 100 years , before @entity0 were permitted to write wills			1
as a result , the government says many pieces of tribal lands are held by many owners -- possibly hundreds , if not thousands of people per parcel			2
officials have said the project allows individual landowners to receive greater value for their share , while cutting administrative costs for the federal government , which manages the @entity35 land trust			2
interior secretary @entity94 said he hopes the agreement helps the government and @entity30 @entity0 turn the page on the ordeal			1
" with the settlement now final , we can put years of discord behind us and start a new chapter in our nation - to - nation relationship , " he said			0
who 's a @entity105 ? it 's complicated opinion : just say no to @entity35 dress - up crazy horse memorial not done after 64 years activist @entity110 dies			0

thousands of @entity0 sued the government for financial mismanagement
under the finalized settlement , $ 1.5 billion will be distributed among individuals
another $ 1.9 billion will go toward *buying* some @entity0 ' slivers of land
@entity14 says the settlement clears " the way for reconciliation "
