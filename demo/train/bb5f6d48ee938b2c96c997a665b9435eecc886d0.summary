-- these pictures were taken within one week of each other in the center of @entity4 and show the incredible resilience of some of its residents in the face of @entity11 's bloody civil war			1
photographer @entity13 's home in the historic area of @entity4 has been badly damaged by gunfire			1
yet , amid the crossfire between opposition and government forces , @entity13 is still organizing the international photography festival he holds every year			1
@entity13 , who owns a gallery in @entity4 , has been running the exhibition for 11 years and was determined that the show would continue despite fighting reaching the center of the city on august 19			1
the festival was due to open on september 15			1
" before that time we were continuing preparations for the festival in the normal way because we did n't think the middle of the city would be affected by the war , " said @entity13			1
" but life changed quickly			0
shooting started to come from every direction , " he added			0
@entity11 's largest city , in the north of the country , has become a key battleground between the @entity40 , which controls parts of the city , and forces loyal to president @entity44 aiming to drive them out			1
until august , the fighting was confined to the countryside surrounding the city , but has since moved closer and closer to the center			1
on august 27 , @entity13 's home in a historic area of the city was badly damaged by gunfire and he says he was trapped inside for nine days while fighting raged outside			1
" the @entity40 's lines were in front of my house , " he said			2
" those nine days were so terrible			0
" " after nine days both sides stopped firing for a short moment to let the civilians out			0
" there was no food in my fridge by then			0
i will never forget those nine days in all my life			0
" @entity65 said in a report on august 23 that civilians had borne the brunt of air strikes , mortar and artillery attacks on residential areas , with scores of people not involved in the conflict killed and injured			0
the @entity76 estimates that 19,000 people have been killed across @entity11 since the uprising began 18 months ago and that 1.2 million people -- half of them children -- have left their homes and become refugees in their own country			2
also on inside the @entity85 : @entity87 artist graffitis minaret , fights intolerance @entity13 is now living with his parents in the center of @entity4 and considers himself lucky			1
he said : " many people are living in the street or in the entrance of buildings , in schools , in churches , in gardens , many families are living together without much space			0
" all night we ca n't sleep because most of the war happens at night			2
sometimes the water cuts out for two or three days , sometimes electricity cuts if they are shooting the cables			0
" many practical problems made organizing a photography festival a near impossibility , he added : there was no communication or internet connection in the city for almost a month , the building where the festival was due to take place was inaccessible and artworks that had been sent by artists around the world had not arrived			1
" it 's almost an impossible situation but we wanted to go on because if we do n't go on people will lose hope , " said @entity13			1
so he organized a smaller scale exhibition in his own gallery -- which had not been damaged -- and 60 people attended the symbolic opening			1
the 870 photographs he has from 48 artists around the world will be shown gradually in a changing display in @entity13 's gallery , rather than all together in a large building as planned			1
a few other galleries in the city have also offered to show parts of the exhibition			2
" people were really happy at the opening , " said @entity13			2
" it 's been really important for everybody			2
" " it all has to change depending on the situation , nothing is certain			0
it all depends on which direction they are shooting in , whether we can get in touch with people to advertise			0
" also on inside the @entity85 : @entity11 artists fight @entity44 regime with satire @entity13 said that many of his traditional audience had fled @entity11 , and instead many of the people coming to the festival had never been to a gallery or been interested in photography before			1
in march , he also launched a peace project called @entity160 in response to the war , which has been dividing the country since protests against @entity44 began in march 2011			2
it is a series of art , music and photography workshops , often aimed at refugees or people who have never been interested in art before			0
" people talk about the refugees in @entity174 or @entity175 , but most refugees are inside the city , " said @entity13			1
" all around @entity4 is war and more and more people are coming to the center			2
" " the center is so crowded , you ca n't imagine how many people are living in the city			2
" " when people do programs for refugees , they give them food and medicine , but not culture or anything to keep them busy			0
" it 's very important to everybody that there 's heart in society still alive and that they still have some hope			0
" these are people who have had to leave their homes , who have never been to a gallery before and now they are turning up to do art and see art. " now about 500 people have taken part in @entity160			0
not altogether , but different people have done different workshops			0
" follow the @entity209 the @entity85 team on @entity211 : presenter @entity213 , producer @entity214 , producer @entity215 , writer @entity216 and digital producer @entity217 : @ mairicnn .			0
