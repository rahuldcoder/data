@entity0 -- the @entity2 finally made it official : @entity0 will be the site of its next multibillion dollar casino and hotel complex and not @entity7 , which just hours before the announcement said it would build its own , smaller gambling resort			1
" @entity7 is an outstanding tourism destination and choosing @entity0 over @entity7 was not an easy selection , " @entity2 chairman and ceo @entity15 said in statement late friday in @entity11			1
@entity16 have dubbed the project " @entity24 " and news media have focused almost daily headlines on the fierce competition between @entity0 , the nation 's capital , and @entity7 , the second - largest city , to win the project			1
the battle came amid the nation 's deep economic crisis , with an unemployment rate of more than 24 % overall and more than 50 % for @entity16 youth			1
the @entity2 project promised to generate up to 250,000 jobs , reports say			2
plans indicate the project would be an approximately 18 billion euros ( $ 22 billion ) development with 12 hotels including 36,000 rooms , six casinos and three golf courses to be built over a decade			0
but @entity2 would provide only up to 35 % of the equity , and the company said the final size of the project , its specific location in @entity0 and financing options still need to be determined			0
@entity16 is in the process of receiving up to a 100 - billion euro bailout from @entity49 authorities for some of the country 's weakest banks , which ran up huge debts when the decade - long property boom crashed			1
even at the healthiest banks here , credit is still tight			0
critics of the gambling complex say it 's the wrong kind of development model for a country trying to pull out of recession			0
the hotel and casino jobs , critics say , would be mainly low - skilled and low paying , besides attracting organized crime to @entity16 , which is already one of the world 's top tourist destinations			1
earlier friday , the @entity72 regional government , whose capital is @entity7 , announced its own gambling resort , called @entity76 , to be built near the city around an existing amusement park			2
@entity76 would be a 4.5 billion euros ( $ 5.7 billion ) investment , with six hotels and six casinos , enough to generate 20,000 jobs , about a fourth of the investment of @entity24 in @entity0			2
weeks ago , @entity2 indicated it would say in early september whether it had chosen @entity0 or @entity7 for the project			1
a @entity0 opposition politician tuesday got a jump on his adversaries in the @entity0 regional government and the @entity2 announcing that he was certain the casino resort would come to @entity0			0
that set off several days of official denials and no comments			0
on thursday , @entity72 officials in @entity7 revealed that their offer to host the @entity2 project expired on august 31			1
and it came down to friday , with @entity72 officials first , and hours later the @entity2 , announcing their gambling resorts for @entity7 and @entity0 , respectively			2
@entity15 , a major donor to the @entity100 , has built @entity2 into a leading global developer of gambling , entertainment and convention resorts			0
the company has the @entity106 and @entity108 gambling resorts on the @entity11 , and has expanded into @entity110 markets , with the @entity112 resort in @entity113			0
on @entity106 , through its majority - owned subsidiary @entity2 , it has the @entity106 and @entity116 properties .			0

@entity16 have dubbed the project " @entity24 "
