-- a powerful explosion rocked @entity3 , @entity4 's most populous city , late friday , killing a guard at an office of president @entity8 's ruling @entity7 , opposition groups reported			1
the cause of the blast was not immediately known			0
heavy gunfire was heard in its aftermath , the @entity12 - based @entity11 reported			0
earlier , @entity4 authorities foiled a suicide bombing in the city , state media said			1
the action comes a day after suicide attackers killed dozens in the capital of @entity22 , a strike that heightened tensions in a country caught in the grip of a popular uprising			1
authorities " intercepted a stolen booby - trapped minibus " that an attacker tried to detonate in @entity3 's densely populated neighborhood of @entity34 , the state - run @entity28 reported			1
a @entity28 correspondent quoted a source in @entity3 province as saying that " competent authorities intercepted the terrorist after he hit two policemen , then he blew himself up with an explosive belt , killing himself , " the news agency said			1
the source said that authorities searching the minibus found four tanks with " a big quantity of explosives			0
" an initial state tv report said the forces killed the bomber before he detonated his vehicle carrying 1,200 kilograms , or 2,645 pounds of explosives			2
@entity22 and @entity3 have been the scene of a flurry of attacks in recent months			1
@entity3 , a commercial center and long a bastion of support for @entity8 , had been largely spared in @entity4 's 14 months of bloody uprising			1
but recent protests and violence there could signal a significant shift			0
elsewhere friday , a number of explosions were reported in cities across the country , including four in @entity68 and several in @entity69 , according to the @entity70 , an opposition group			2
at least 20 people , including the @entity3 security guard , were killed across the country , the @entity11 said			1
@entity4 's foreign ministry underscored the urban violence in identical letters to @entity77 secretary - general @entity76 and @entity79 president @entity78 , who is the @entity80 ambassador to the @entity77			1
the letters said that @entity22 , @entity3 and other @entity4 cities " witnessed several terrorist bombings over the last weeks " that left dozens of innocent people dead , the state - run news agency reported			1
the letters said the country is facing " terrorist " assaults spearheaded by groups that get arms and money from entities encouraging the actions			1
the letters said the " armed terrorist groups " are violating international envoy @entity96 's peace plan and attacked a convoy from the @entity77 observer team wednesday in @entity68 province			1
there were no injuries in that bombing attack			0
maj. gen. @entity104 , the head of the observer team , was in the convoy			0
" @entity4 will move forward to combat terrorism and defend its people and sovereignty and preserve security and stability in it , " the letters said			2
@entity4 blames " terrorists " for the attacks , the term it uses to describe the opposition and rationalize security forces ' crackdown			1
some analysts said the attacks raise concerns about the presence of jihadist elements in @entity4 , noting thursday 's @entity22 strikes resemble suicide car bombings during the sectarian violence in @entity128 in the past decade			1
but opposition groups have said the regime is responsible for the violence that erupted after it began a crackdown on peaceful protests in march 2011			1
that fierce clampdown spurred a grassroots uprising against the regime			0
the @entity77 estimates that at least 9,000 people have died in the conflict , while opposition groups put the death toll at more than 11,000			1
the opposition @entity140 said @entity8 's regime staged thursday 's deadly suicide bombings in @entity22 " to spur chaos , disrupt the work of the international observers and divert attention away from other crimes being committed by its forces elsewhere			2
" " in orchestrating such acts , " the council said friday , " the regime seeks to prove its claims of the existence of ' armed terrorist gangs ' in the country that are hindering its so - called ' efforts of political reform			2
' " more than 55 people were killed and 370 were injured in thursday 's two car bombings near a military intelligence center in the @entity163 neighborhood of @entity22 , the nation 's capital			0
it was the deadliest attack since the uprising against the regime began			0
but the council questioned how the bombers could have made it past security to conduct the bombings			0
" the security branch is heavily guarded and surrounded with cement barriers at a distance from the exterior fence			0
it would be reckless to carry out such an attack , because it would in no way impact the security building			0
" one of the cars was loaded with a large amount of explosive materials			0
how is it possible that these explosives made it past hundreds of security checkpoints surrounding the entrance to the capital ? " with the focus on the attacks and their aftermath , " the regime carried out arbitrary arrests across the country , most notable in the @entity22 suburb of @entity196 , " the council said			2
the latest bombings did n't deter @entity4 from taking to the streets in protest across the country friday , the day opposition groups have been staging nationwide protests			1
but the attacks cast doubt on the effectiveness of the @entity77 - @entity209 initiative to impose a truce and a six - point peace plan , forged by @entity96 , the former @entity77 secretary - general			2
since the cease - fire went into effect on april 12 , the @entity70 reports more than 1,000 people have died			0
an unarmed @entity77 observer mission has been monitoring the adherence to the cease - fire and peace plan			2
the mission now has 145 observers and 56 civilian staff deployed in @entity4 and is carrying out patrols , a @entity77 spokesman said friday			1
three hundred observers are expected within weeks			0
@entity96 is weighing an invitation to meet with @entity8 in @entity4 , his spokesman said as the deadly blasts in @entity22 drew widespread condemnation			2
@entity4 's foreign minister invited him days ago , and the invitation is not tied to thursday 's attacks , a @entity77 source said			1
@entity234 , meanwhile , condemned thursday 's suicide bombings and accused outside nations of instigating violence			0
" some countries are inciting outside forces to interfere into the @entity4 situation , which is unacceptable , " @entity234 foreign minister @entity238 said , according to @entity240 state media			0
@entity238 , in @entity244 for talks with his @entity240 counterpart , did not specify the countries			0
" such acts aim to push the country to a new bloody and extremely dangerous wave of violence , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity252 , @entity253 and @entity254 contributed to this report .			0
