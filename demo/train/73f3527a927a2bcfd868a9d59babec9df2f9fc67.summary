-- on a blazing summer 's day in 1961 , a race horse called @entity2 decided enough was enough and took an impromptu dip in a nearby lake			1
the only problem ? he was racing at the @entity7 at the time			2
jockey @entity8 was sent flying as the horse made a sharp detour for the scenic infield lake			0
adding insult to injury , wilful @entity2 n boots had been winning the race at the time			0
the fabled plunge has gained almost legendary status in @entity18 , with @entity7 now holding an annual @entity19 -- ending with a traditional leap into the lake by the winning jockey and trainer			1
but as @entity18 government funding cuts take their toll , it seems the jockeys are not the only ones trying to stay afloat			1
the picturesque 115 - year - old @entity7 track now looks set for closure after controversial changes to gambling taxes			1
" the whole racing industry in @entity36 is in trouble , " @entity7 economic development and tourism corporation manager , @entity34 , said			1
" @entity7 is on a closing plan for the end of this year			2
the only thing that would interrupt that plan would be if we increased our business from cad $ 30million ( $ 30.6million ) to cad $ 35million ( $ 35.6million ) a year			0
" @entity34 said the outlook was fairly bleak for the historic track which employs 240 people			0
it is thought another 600 jobs could be lost through support services if it is forced to close its doors as planned in december			0
at least 25,000 racing jobs in @entity18 are under threat from the controversial new laws , says the industry			2
under the plans , funding sourced from a tax on government - owned slot machines at race tracks will be redirected			1
the result ? around cad $ 345million ( $ 351million ) of funding coming into the sport will be lost			0
currently , race tracks and horse owners receive 10 % each of this fund to invest in facilities and thoroughbreds			1
but from march , that money will instead be directed into the government 's general revenues			2
legislators in @entity72 have offered cad $ 50 million ( $ 51million ) of ' transitional funding ' to the industry to ease the burden			0
but @entity76 , president of the @entity77 , said many in the industry are bracing for the worst			0
" we have 17 race tracks in @entity36			1
three of them have already had the government slot machines removed and one has said that they are unable to stay in business after the end of the year , " she said			0
" if that is the way it is going to be when the funding program fully closes in march , we will be down to nine race tracks at most			1
" she added : " it 's about jobs , sure , but it 's also about the welfare of the animals too			0
who is looking after the horses if no one is buying them ? what level of care will they get if the amount of money is cut ? " amid austerity , the @entity36 provincial government says it was compelled to overhaul its tax system on slot machines			2
" given our current economic situation our government is committed to reviewing all programs in order to reduce the rate of spending growth , " said ministerial spokesman @entity109			0
" the slots at @entity118 is no exception			0
since 1998 the horse racing industry has received cad $ 3.7billion ( $ 3.77billion ) in government support -- that 's more money than we spend on water and road safety			1
" at the end of the day we need to ask ourselves whether the government should be in the business of healthcare and education or horse racing			1
" @entity134 's @entity133 and it 's not just the @entity18 racing industry feeling the pinch			1
since the 1960s , when off - track betting was legalized in @entity134 , the racing industry has benefited from a direct payment from bookmakers called the @entity133			1
but that @entity142 is now under threat as some firms take advantage of a loophole which allows them to base online wagering units outside the @entity134 and pay no money -- despite taking bets on @entity134 races			2
" the @entity142 has almost halved in value between 2009 and 2011 to Â £ 34 million ( $ 53 million ) and this is starving the sport of prize money , which is its lifeblood , " says @entity134 member of parliament @entity152 , who is trying to close the loophole			2
" i speak to owners who now can not cover their fuel costs to get to the race tracks , even when their horses perform well			2
" he says if no action is taken to reform the @entity142 , it could put at risk the livelihoods of some of the nation 's 100,000 horse racing employees			1
in response , @entity134 betting companies say a change in the rules would lead to extra costs for them and the possibility of 2,000 betting industry workers losing their jobs			2
one of the ' offshore ' companies at the center of the issue , @entity183 , has tried to strike a balance by signing a five - year , Â £ 40 million ( $ 63 million ) funding deal with the @entity186			1
future of horse racing ? with betting and gambling proving to be a source of funding headaches , could racing bodies walk away from wagering as a main source of revenue and look to make it in other ways ? " relying on handouts is not the way forward and it is all about trying to harness all the assets you have in racing and not sit back on a single funding mechanism , " says @entity197 , development director of @entity198 , an organization looking to boost race track attendances and revenues			1
" it 's about making the product on the track far more attractive to corporate sponsors and families alike so they want to be part of it			0
" that includes marketing to a new audience -- when they come they wo n't just pay at the gate , they will eat here , drink here , bet here and each day adds to the diversification of our income			0
" and it seems to be working			0
the number of people visiting @entity134 racing meetings rose by 5 % in the past year , according to @entity134 horse racing commercial group @entity235			1
meanwhile , the @entity186 will also help deliver Â £ 50 million ( $ 79 million ) worth of improvements to racing facilities , through the sale of the former state bookmakers			0
even the owners of @entity7 in @entity36 are now turning away from gambling in a bid to secure its future			1
plans for a hotel and tourist resort have overtaken the battle to secure government state funding , as @entity34 explained			0
" we are nine miles from @entity250 and just over the border from the @entity252			0
we could build a place to stay which encourages tourists to come here and still see the horse racing , " he said			2
" things are tough with the removal of the slots revenue , but there still is hope that we could get funding to build something different here and keep racing alive			0

half of @entity36 's race tracks could close when government pulls funding scheme
feeling the pinch is 115 - year - old @entity7 in @entity36 , @entity18
@entity134 racing starts finding new revenue sources to offset fall in betting money
future of horse racing may lie in marketing to family *friendly* audience
