he must like competing in @entity14 , since he captured the @entity10 10 years ago in the same state			0
@entity1 struck 11 birdies and an eagle in his second round			1
although he cooled after firing a 28 in his first nine holes , @entity1 birdied the ninth -- a short putt -- to tie the record that was last matched in 2010 by @entity23 and @entity24			1
the crowd at @entity26 roared its approval and @entity28 was one of those rooting for @entity1			1

" it 'll sink in later , " the 43 - year - old added			0
the second part of that is i 'll have to calm down later on tonight and realize i 've got myself in contention in a golf tournament			0
i 'll enjoy this one for a few hours at least and have fun with it			0
" indeed based on his first - round showing , there was no hint of what was to come			2
@entity1 , now the world 's 15th - ranked golfer , struggled thursday , carding a one - over - par 72 , and he was nine shots behind overnight leader @entity53			1
now he is tied for the lead with his fellow @entity55			0
the highlight of @entity1 's round had to be an eagle on the 15th			1
" i watched the gallery and they started standing up and the arms went up , and that 's how i knew it went in , " said @entity1 , who won the last of his 16 @entity8 titles in 2010			2
" usually on sundays i do n't ever sleep , whether i play good or poorly			0
i 'm always running back the moments of the day i could have improved -- there 's not much i could have improved today so i think i 'll sleep well			0
" @entity1 and @entity53 hold a three - shot lead over @entity70 while world no. 1 @entity71 is seven shots behind			2
@entity74 's poor season continued as he 's in 70th -- last place			0
