@entity1 quarterback @entity0 and head coach @entity3 on thursday said they did n't deflate footballs at sunday 's @entity6 , a controversy that 's cast a shadow over their team as it prepares for the @entity11			1
" i did n't alter the ball in any way , " @entity0 said at a press conference			1
" i have no knowledge of wrongdoing			0
" " i have no explanation , " @entity3 said of the controversy dubbed " @entity18			0
" the @entity20 is investigating why game balls the @entity1 provided for sunday 's @entity6 were underinflated			1
@entity24 , citing @entity20 sources familiar with the probe , reported that 11 of 12 game balls that the @entity1 used on offense were found to be underinflated by about 2 pounds per square inch each			1
a ball with lower inflation is said by some to be easier to grip and may give the passer a competitive advantage			0
what the heck is " @entity35 " anyway ? @entity0 said he picked the footballs he wanted to use five hours before the game , feeling the laces and the leather but not paying attention to the inflation level			1
the @entity20 mandates balls should be 12.5 - 13.5 psi			2
" it 's not like i squeeze the football , " he said			0
" i grip the football			0
" @entity0 said he did n't touch the balls again until the game began			1
the referees inspect footballs about two hours before kickoff and deliver them to " ball attendants " who take them to the sidelines , according to @entity20 rules			2
the @entity1 ' opponent , the @entity57 , provided their own footballs			2
@entity0 also said he could n't tell any difference between the balls in the first and second halves			1
internet reacts to @entity0 's press conference radio station @entity64 in @entity66 reported that the underinflated balls were discovered in the first half and replaced with properly inflated balls in the second half , when the @entity1 expanded their lead over the @entity57			1
the final score was 45 - 7			0
ball inflation may not be a problem at the february 1 @entity11 game between the @entity1 and the @entity76			1
@entity77 , the @entity20 's vice president of football communications , said @entity80 equipment manager @entity79 will oversee the game balls			1
dressed casually in a sweater and a wool hat , @entity0 seemed amused by the controversy at times during the 30 - minute press conference			0
@entity0 , 37 , is the handsome face of the @entity1 , one of the @entity89 ' most successful sports franchises			1
the team has won three @entity11 , all with @entity3 and @entity0 , and won its division , the @entity91 , 12 times in 14 years			1
his stardom reaches far beyond football fans , since he 's married to model @entity95 and has worked as a model himself			0
his net worth is $ 120 million , according to @entity98			0
though @entity0 himself has a clean image , suspicions of the @entity1 remain because of a 2007 cheating incident -- called " @entity103 " -- in which the team stole defensive signals from the @entity106			1
@entity3 was fined $ 500,000 and the @entity20 took away a first - round draft pick			1
some people are suspicious of @entity0			0
speaking thursday morning on @entity2 affiliate @entity111 , former @entity110 quarterback @entity109 said , " its obvious @entity0 had something to do with this			2
for the balls to have been deflated , that does n't happen until the quarterback wants that to happen , i can assure you of that			1
" @entity120 coach @entity119 told @entity121 he believed @entity3 was clueless about the ball pressure , but " i can see -- and you hate to make examples of what you can see because that sounds like you are accusing someone -- but i can see that being between the quarterback and the equipment guy			2
" though the @entity20 announced its investigation on monday , @entity0 said nobody from the league has questioned him			2
@entity0 said he did n't know anything about @entity18 until a monday interview with @entity64 , in which he said the idea of tampering with footballs is " ridiculous			1
" on thursday , he said , " i was surprised as anybody when i heard monday morning what was happening			0
" when a reporter directly asked @entity0 whether he was a cheater , the quarterback replied : " i do n't believe so			2
i 've always played within the rules			0
" he added that he does n't have all the answers , but does n't know of anybody in the @entity1 organization who might have done something wrong with the ball			2
" i do n't know what happened over the course of the process with the footballs			0
i was preparing for my own job , doing what i needed to do , " he said			0
earlier on thursday , @entity3 said he was " shocked " to hear allegations that his team 's footballs were underinflated			1
he said that he 's learned more about the football inflation process in three days than he has known or talked about in his 40 years in the league			0
" in my entire coaching career , i have never talked to any player ( or ) staff member about football air pressure , " the @entity1 coach said at a press conference			0
" that is not a subject that i have ever brought up			0
to me , the footballs are approved by the league ... pregame , and we play with what 's out there			0
" @entity3 -- one of the most successful head coaches in @entity20 history with three @entity11 rings and 211 regular - season wins -- insisted he had no explanation for how the footballs his team used sunday might have gotten deflated			1
but " in the future , " @entity3 said , @entity1 's game balls will be inflated at high - enough levels -- so closer to 13.5 psi than 12.5 psi , when they may naturally drop to below acceptable levels -- " to account for any possible change during the game			1
" his comments come days after @entity190 reporter @entity189 broke the news after sunday 's game that the @entity20 was looking into whether the @entity1 used underinflated footballs during the @entity6 championship contest			1
the underinflation came to light on the field after @entity57 linebacker @entity198 intercepted a pass thrown by @entity0			0
for all the talk by unnamed sources , the @entity20 's official statement on the controversy is succinct : " we are continuing our review and will provide information as soon as possible			2
" @entity18 is not the @entity20 's only scandal this year			2
the league established a six - game unpaid ban for personnel who violate the league 's policy on domestic violence after several players were arrested			0
@entity3 talks @entity18 in front of @entity217 ad @entity2 's @entity218 , @entity219 and @entity220 contributed to this report .			0
