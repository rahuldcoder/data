@entity0 's been a fictional hero for decades , but in @entity3 , @entity4 , today there 's a hero named @entity0 who is definitely real -- only he 's 8 years old and has four legs			1
this @entity0 , a @entity8 retriever - husky mix , is being hailed for pulling a 9 - year - old girl from an icy river on @entity11			1
his owner , @entity12 , 27 , is getting similar praise			2
" if that man and dog were n't there -- i just try not to think of it , " @entity17 , the mother of @entity19 , 9 , and her 10 - year - old sister , @entity20 , said in an interview with @entity23 affiliate @entity22			1
" i just want to give him a big hug and tell him he 's my hero			0
if he was n't there i would n't have my girls , " @entity28 said			0
" doctors said two more minutes and @entity33 would have been gone			0
" @entity0 and @entity12 's heroics played out on the icy @entity35 in @entity3 on sunday afternoon			1
the girls were tobogganing in a riverside park when they ended up on ice extending from the riverbank , their father , @entity36 , told @entity23 affiliate @entity41			2
" from what i was told was , one of the toboggans came off the snowbank and onto the ice and they were trying to come back and the ice broke , " he said			0
@entity12 said he was walking on a bridge over the river when he heard screams			1
looking down on the river he saw one girl in the icy water and her sister trying to pull her out			2
by the time he and @entity56 sprinted down to the river , both girls were in the water			2
he was able to pull @entity20 up onto the ice , but the current was carrying @entity33 downstream , about 4 or 5 feet from the edge of the ice , her head going in and out of the water , @entity12 told a press conference monday			2
he asked the girl if she could swim to him			0
" she said she could n't move her arms , could n't move her legs , " @entity12 said			2
he tried throwing @entity0 's leash to her but it did n't reach			1
then , as he tried to get closer , the ice gave way beneath him and his dog			0
" he managed to get his front paws on the ice and i pushed his back end up so he was on the ice , then i used the leash and him to kind of pull myself up onto the ice , " @entity12 said			1
by this time , @entity33 had drifted 50 or 60 yards farther down the river , still bobbing in and out of the ice - cold water			0
@entity12 and @entity0 ran to her again , but she was still out of reach			0
" i put the leash around @entity0 and pushed him to get in the water and i told her if she could get ahold of his leash , we could get her back to the ice , " @entity12 said			1
" he jumped in right beside her , " he said , and the girl managed to get both hands on @entity0 's leash			1
" i called him back and he swam toward the ice , " @entity12 said , getting close enough that he could grab both the girl 's arm and his dog and drag them away from the water 's edge			1
fire rescue crews arrived shortly thereafter and took the sisters for treatment			0
on monday , they were home with their grateful mother , and @entity12 and @entity0 were being honored at the fire station -- @entity12 with a fireman 's hat and @entity0 with a giant rawhide bone he grabbed from fire chief @entity109 before @entity109 could take off its plastic wrapper			1
" these two young ladies are very , very fortunate that such a family happened along and were able to intervene , " @entity109 said			0
@entity12 could n't dispute that			0
" i guess it 's just a bit of a miracle that everything worked out perfectly , " he told @entity22 .			0
