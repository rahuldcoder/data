-- federal authorities have launched a criminal investigation into the practices at the company linked to a fungal meningitis outbreak blamed for 23 deaths , @entity8 gov. @entity7 told reporters tuesday			1
in addition , the @entity10 has voted to revoke permanently the @entity13 's license to operate in @entity8 as well as the licenses of the company 's three principal pharmacists , @entity7 said			1
the announcements came in the wake of a damning nine - page report , released tuesday by the board , which is part of the state 's @entity21			1
investigators for the state 's @entity21 , working with their counterparts at the @entity34 , " identified serious deficiencies and significant violations of pharmacy law and regulations that clearly placed the public 's health at risk , " it said			1
according to the investigator 's preliminary findings , the @entity13 : -- distributed large quantities of its products to facilities , " apparently for general use rather than requiring a prescription for an individual patient " as state law requires			1
-- distributed two recalled lots of methylprednisolone acetate before it had learned the results of sterility tests			0
-- did not follow proper sterilization standards			0
-- produced vials of methylprednisolone that were later recalled that contained " visible black particulate matter			0
" -- failed to thoroughly clean powder hoods , which are intended to protect pharmacists from inhaling substances while medication is being prepared , which " may subsequently lead to contamination of compounded medications			2
" -- used " visibly soiled " mats outside " clean rooms , " potentially leading to their contamination			0
-- failed to repair a leaking boiler adjacent to the clean room , which resulted in a pool of water around the boiler and adjacent walls creating an unsanitary condition			0
@entity7 said the state would begin making unannounced inspections of pharmacies that prepare injectable medications and require that they submit annual reports detailing what they produce , how much of it and where it is distributed			2
" it is now clear that the @entity13 violated state law and endangered the health of countless patients , " said @entity83 rep. @entity82 , @entity8 , in a statement			1
the senior member of the @entity90 , which has jurisdiction over the @entity34 , vowed to introduce legislation to improve safety of drugs made by compounding pharmacies			0
the incident began unfolding on september 24 , when the department said it was notified about a cluster of six rare fungal meningitis cases in @entity100			1
the patients shared several risk factors , including an epidural injection of a steroid -- methylprednisolone acetate 80 mg / ml preservative free -- that had been compounded at @entity13 in @entity107 , @entity8			1
the department soon learned that the suspect product had been distributed to more than 14,000 patients in 23 states			0
investigators arriving at the company on september 26 " found @entity13 employees cleaning sterile compounding areas and and conducting environmental testing , " the report says			2
" @entity21 investigators also detected signs of bleach decontamination in the compounding areas			2
" @entity21 has asked two other companies -- @entity123 and @entity124 -- to cease all pharmacy operations based on their shared ownership and leadership with @entity13			2
on october 15 , federal authorities said that another @entity13 steroid injection , triamcinolone acetonide , might have caused a patient to acquire fungal meningitis , and they began contacting all 192 state facilities that received any @entity13 injectable products			1
three days later , the @entity34 confirmed that sealed vials of methylprednisolone acetate had been contaminated with fungi			0
on monday , the board authorized @entity21 staff to seek the permanent surrender of the licenses of the @entity13 principals , who are prohibited from practicing pharmacy throughout any appeals			1
" @entity13 's transparency in dealing with the board since inception in 1998 demonstrates its good faith intention to operate in compliance with the requirements of its license , " said @entity146 , a @entity147 - based lawyer representing the compounder , in a statement on tuesday			1
" furthermore , the company 's intention and best efforts at compliance are equally applicable in every other state in which it has been licensed			1
" tuesday 's events came a day after the @entity34 posted on its website a list of more than 1,200 hospitals and clinics that it said had purchased drugs from the compounding center that , if contaminated , would be especially dangerous			0
but the agency took down the list after discovering inaccuracies			0
" @entity34 has found some technical problems with the list and the data are incorrect , " the agency said in a statement on its website			0
" @entity34 is working to correct the list and will re-post when we are sure it is accurate			0
" @entity100 has been the hardest - hit state in the meningitis outbreak , with 70 cases as of tuesday , according to the @entity184			1
@entity185 is a close second , with 68 cases as of tuesday			0
in all , 308 cases have been tallied			0
