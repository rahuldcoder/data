@entity1 's @entity0 has passed a controversial bill that would allow business owners , as long as they assert their religious beliefs , to deny service to gay and lesbian customers			1
the bill , which the state @entity9 passed by a 33 - 27 vote thursday , now goes to gov. @entity12 , a @entity13 and onetime small business owner who vetoed similar legislation last year but has expressed the right of business owners to deny service			1
" i think anybody that owns a business can choose who they work with or who they do n't work with , " @entity12 told @entity18 in @entity19 on friday			1
" but i do n't know that it needs to be statutory			0
in my life and in my businesses , if i do n't want to do business or if i do n't want to deal with a particular company or person or whatever , i 'm not interested			1
" as expected , the measure has drawn criticism from @entity39 and business groups who said it would sanction discrimination and open the state to the risk of damaging litigation			1
on friday , the @entity47 group @entity46 staged a protest march to the governor 's office that drew about 200 people			1
some carried signs with messages " @entity55 created us all equal " and " @entity56 on @entity1			0
" @entity59 - based @entity58 's @entity57 posted a photo on its @entity62 page of a sign with a message for state lawmakers : " we reserve the right to refuse service to @entity1 legislators			2
" " it 's a ridiculous bill , " pizzeria manager @entity69 told @entity18 on friday			1
" @entity1 has much bigger problems than allowing businesses to discriminate against people			2
" in a statement , @entity74 , the state senate @entity39 minority leader , said : " with the express consent of @entity13 in this legislature , many @entity77 will find themselves members of a separate and unequal class under this law because of their sexual orientation			2
this bill may also open the door to discriminate based on race , familial status , religion , sex , national origin , age or disability			2
" the @entity94 , in a letter to @entity12 on friday , urged the governor to veto @entity96 , saying the " legislation will likely have profound , negative effects on our business community for years to come			1
" " the legislation places businesses currently in @entity1 , as well as those looking to locate here , in potentially damaging risk of litigation , and costly , needless legal disputes , " council president @entity101 wrote , adding that four unidentified companies have vowed to locate elsewhere if the legislation is signed			0
he added , " with major events approaching in the coming year , including @entity113 , @entity1 will be the center of the world 's stage			0
this legislation has the potential of subjecting the @entity113 , and major events surrounding it , to the threats of boycotts			0
" on @entity18 's " the lead with @entity124 , " @entity1 state rep. @entity122 , a @entity13 , said the bill would not allow hotel clerks or waiters , for instance , to turn away customers , unless there was a " substantial burden on their sincerely held religious beliefs			1
" the bill is being pushed by the @entity135 , a conservative group opposed to abortion and same - sex marriage			2
the group has justified the measure on grounds that the proposal protects people against increasingly activist federal courts			1
" as we witness hostility towards people of faith grow like never before , we must take this opportunity to speak up for religious liberty , " the group said on its website , asking people to contact @entity12 and urge her to sign the bill			1
" the great news is that @entity156 protects your right to live and work according to your faith			2
" @entity135 , the center 's president , told @entity18 on friday , " the @entity1 bill has a very simple premise , that @entity34 should be free to live and work according to their religious faith			1
it 's simply about protecting religious liberty and nothing else			0
" @entity135 said the bill 's opponents are " showing unbelievable hostility toward religious beliefs			2
" " @entity34 still stands for the principle that religious beliefs matter ( for ) something in this country , that we have the right to freely exercise our religious beliefs , " she said			0
but @entity177 , a spokesman for the @entity19 - based @entity178 , told @entity18 the legislation would " fling the door wide open to discrimination , not just against gay people , but basically to any class of individuals that a religious fundamentalist decides he or she does n't want to deal with			1
" he added , " a woman who is pregnant out of wedlock , for example , ' well , out the door , you do n't get served in my business			2
' " the @entity1 legislation was passed as conservative states work to counter laws legalizing same - sex marriage			0
@entity1 voters approved a ban on same - sex marriage as a state constitutional amendment in 2008			0
the @entity203 of @entity1 called the bill " unnecessary and discriminatory			0
" " what today 's bill does is allow private individuals and businesses to use religion to discriminate , sending a message that @entity1 is intolerant and unwelcoming , " the group said in a statement			0
some @entity13 legislators have defended the bill as a @entity215 issue			0
@entity39 dismissed it as an attack on gays and lesbians			1
" it 's a very bad day for @entity1 , " rep. @entity220 , a @entity222 @entity221 who voted against the legislation , told @entity18 friday			1
he added , " let there be no doubt about what this bill does			0
it 's going to allow people to discriminate against the gay community in @entity1			0
it goes after unprotected classes of people and we all know that the biggest unprotected class of people in the state is the @entity47 community			0
if we were having this conversation in regard to african - americans or women , there would be outrage across the country right now			0

not sure this needs to be a law , governor tells @entity18
@entity96 allows business owners to deny service to gays , lesbians
critics say the measure sanctions discrimination
*proponents* of the bill say it protects people against activist federal courts
