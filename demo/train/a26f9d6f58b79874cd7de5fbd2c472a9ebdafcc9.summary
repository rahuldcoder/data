-- the suspected mastermind of the deadly 2012 attack on the @entity5 mission in @entity6 , @entity7 , is expected to be brought to @entity5 soil as soon as this weekend , a senior law enforcement source told @entity0 on thursday			1
@entity10 was lured earlier this month to a location south of the city in eastern @entity7 and grabbed without a fight by @entity5 commandos and @entity16 agents , multiple officials said			1
he 's spent most of the past two weeks aboard the @entity17 being interrogated by the @entity16 - led @entity18 , known as @entity19 , that includes agents from the @entity16 , @entity20 and the @entity21			2
as that vessel -- an amphibious transport dock ship -- nears the coast , it is expected that @entity10 will be flown off of it on a @entity28 aircraft to an undisclosed location , where he will be held as he awaits prosecution in a federal court in @entity32			1
the @entity33 is expected to announce a formal indictment of @entity10 soon after he arrives in the @entity5			1
already , a federal judge has unsealed charges accusing @entity10 of killing a person in the course of an attack on a federal facility with a firearm and dangerous weapons , as well as attempting and conspiring to provide material support to terrorists resulting in death			2
@entity10 is accused in connection with the september 11 , 2012 , attack that left @entity5 ambassador @entity48 and three other @entity5 citizens dead			1
president @entity50 has described @entity10 as " one of the masterminds of the attack			1
" " it 's a message to the world , that when @entity5 are attacked , no matter how long it takes , we will find those responsible and we will bring them to justice			2
regardless how long it takes , we will find you , " the president said earlier this month			0
republicans , though , have hammered @entity50 and members of his administration on @entity6 -- claiming they did n't do enough to protect the diplomatic mission and have since covered up what happened			0
some @entity61 lawmakers criticized the @entity33 for failing to bring @entity10 to justice even as he taunted @entity5 authorities in a meeting with @entity0 's @entity70 at a well - known luxury hotel in @entity6 in may 2013			1
chief among those targeted by @entity61 is @entity74 , secretary of state at the time of the attack and now the overwhelming favorite for the 2016 @entity79 presidential nomination , if she opts to run			0
she and administration officials have repeatedly denied the @entity61 allegations about @entity6			0
after news broke of @entity10 's capture , @entity83 said she was " very pleased " and hopefully it will shed more light on what happened			0
" i 'm still looking for answers , " she added			0
" we 're doing our best we can to find out what happened			0
