@entity1 , @entity0 -- prejudice is a funny thing			2
i was prepared not to like @entity7 's @entity6			2
not that i thought it would be a bad car -- @entity7 , as a rule , is n't prone to making duff automobiles -- it 's just i was n't entirely sure what it was supposed to be			1
an executive coupe with a 5 - liter v10 engine and 500 bhp ? with a price tag that could buy you a @entity18 or most of an @entity19 ? what fresh nonsense was this ? but prejudice is there to be challenged			1
the aggressive front air intakes , 19 " alloy wheels and carbon fiber roof mean that this is n't any ordinary 6 - series taking delivery of the @entity6 at my home in @entity31 , southern @entity0 , i felt the car looked ever so slightly out of place			1
after all i live in an electoral ward which elected three @entity36 representatives to the city council and is predicted to deliver the first @entity39 member to the national government at the next general election			2
muscular sports cars are n't common sights on my street ( someone once parked a @entity46 here but he got a dirty look for it )			1
an acquaintance , @entity49 , strolled past			0
" hello , " i said , " it 's not mine "			0
second - guessing his likely prejudices i added , " it 's rather ostentatious , i know			1
" " i do n't know , " replied @entity49 , " i think it 's quite understated , quite elegant			0
my wife and i then filled the surprisingly roomy trunk with our luggage and various gifts ( the weekend being the occasion of my father - in - law 's 70th birthday ) and prepared for our journey to the @entity65 in central @entity0			1
you can spend a lot of time preparing for a journey in an @entity6			0
you can choose a location for the sat - nav to direct you to and whether the directions are displayed as a map or as a perspective diagram			1
you can choose to listen to @entity74 , radio or an external audio source and then modify the acoustic properties with a graphic equalizer and various surround sound settings			0
you can program the " m " button on the steering wheel so that the various suspension , gearing and power settings can be switched between sedate motorway driving and utter lunacy			0
you can adjust the seat 's height and rake ; inflate , deflate and position the lumbar support so the small of your back is just so and adjust the seat wings to hold you as tight as a doting grandmother , should you wish			0
the car is started with a start / stop button			1
this is best done with the window open because the @entity6 is front - engined and the general cabin ambience is too refined to be invaded with the brutish noises of the 5 - liter @entity98			1
even so , the hood 's sound insulation means that you never get the eviscerating snarl that juvenile men -- such as myself -- expect from a supercar			0
the automatic gearbox can be put in a fully - automatic mode , or gears can be selected by nudging the sequential gear lever , or flipping the paddle - shifts behind the steering wheel			2
the car is surprisingly civilized at low speeds			1
it does n't feel like you 're taming a monster			0
if anything there 's a slight lag between pushing the throttle and the forwards crawl			0
navigational and speedometer readings are projected onto the windscreen by the head - up display , creating the impression of a floating screen a few feet in front of the car			1
this omnipresent reminder of speed is good news for my ( unblemished ) driving licence as it is horribly easily to drive way too fast in the @entity6			0
it is so stable that 30 mph feels like a walking pace and i would n't want to incriminate myself by stating the speed i found myself doing on the public highway while thinking i was driving at just about the speed limit			0
naturally the head - up display can also be customized and , in " m " mode displays speed and a graphic display of rev ranges , in favor of navigational instructions			2
put simply the @entity6 is perfect on the highways , which would make up the majority of my journey ( much of it , coincidentally , on a highway called the " @entity6 " )			0
you are under no compulsion to drive like a hooligan			0
with the power button off ( meaning you have only 400 not 500 horses at your disposal ) , and at its least - sporty setting , the @entity6 drives like a perfectly ordinary @entity7 -- composed , sturdy but able to accelerate out of trouble when necessary			1
on country roads it handles diligently , holding corners reassuringly but without the physical sensation you get driving smaller , lower sports cars			2
i 'm assured that you can drive the @entity6 like a hooligan if you wish , taking advantage of the @entity163 -- a torque - sensing differential that can provide between zero and 100 per cent of the drive forces to either driven wheel -- and the @entity168 mode which allows the car to perform on the edge for as long as possible before kicking in the dynamic stability control to keep the car in line			1
sadly time , conditions , and my wife 's insistence that we arrived in one piece , prevented me from testing these attributes			0
the point of the @entity6 , then , is that it 's both a refined , four - seater grand tourer and a sports car			1
it has , as the car wash attendant in a supermarket parking lot in @entity186 suggested " too much electronics " but those electronics are necessary for performing the car 's dual roles			2
the car 's not without niggles : the indicator stalk is too short ( and would it hurt to put an indicator display on the head - up ? )			1
it 's very thirsty ( officially 19 mpg , but we managed rather less ) and the 70 - liter tank is insufficient for long journeys			2
the lag between gear changes at low speed is rather annoying			0
and the compromise between sports car thrills and autobahn civility means that it does n't sound , or look , like a schoolboy 's fantasy			1
but perhaps that 's the point			0
far from being ostentatious , the @entity6 is the devil dressed as middle - management : it does bad things very respectably			2

500 bhp @entity98 - engined variant of the @entity215
seats four *adults* in *comfort* , while providing sports car thrills
surprisingly *practical* , but offers *disappointing* fuel economy and range
