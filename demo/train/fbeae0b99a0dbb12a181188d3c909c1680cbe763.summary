@entity0 -- in the past 15 years , @entity2 has helped pull more than 67,000 tires from the @entity4 and other waterways across the @entity6			1
but that 's just scratching the surface			2
he 's also helped retrieve 218 washing machines , 19 tractors , 12 hot tubs , four pianos and almost 1,000 refrigerators			2
" people intentionally dumped ( these ) in the river and also littered , " @entity2 said			1
" even 100 miles away , ( trash ) will find its way into a creek or a storm drain and into , ultimately , the @entity4			1
" for @entity22 , removing this debris has become his life 's work			2
sometimes called " the @entity28 ' @entity27 , " he lives on a barge about nine months out of the year with members of his 12 - person crew			2
together , they organize community cleanups along rivers across the country			1
" the garbage got into the water one piece at a time , " @entity2 said			1
" and that 's the only way it 's going to come out			2
" it 's a dirty job , but @entity22 , 38 , took it on because he realized that no one was doing it			1
it began as a solo effort , and over the years his energy , enthusiasm and dedication have helped it grow			0
to date , about 70,000 volunteers have joined his crusade , helping him collect more than 7 million pounds of debris through his nonprofit , @entity52			1
@entity22 grew up in @entity53 , @entity54 , where the @entity4 was in his backyard			1
as a teenager , he worked as a commercial shell diver and began to notice the heaps of debris in the fabled waterway -- one that supplies drinking water to 18 million people in more than 50 @entity6 cities			1
" i saw thousands of barrels , thousands of tires , cars , trucks and tops of school buses			0
... i got sick of seeing it and just wanted to do something about it , " he said			0
with persistence , sincerity and a lot of chutzpah , @entity22 got a small grant from @entity82 in 1997 and spent that summer cleaning a 35 - mile stretch of the river by himself			1
he would transport the trash by boat and sort it on his parents ' lawn to be recycled			0
by year 's end , he had single - handedly pulled around 45,000 pounds of trash out of the river			0
his operation has become much more sophisticated since those early days , as his nonprofit now has a fleet of boats			1
and while he has resources and know - how , he depends on each community he visits to supply the manpower needed to get the job done			1
on average , @entity22 says he organizes 70 cleanups a year in 50 communities			1
the cleanups are posted on the nonprofit 's website , @entity107 and other outlets so people know where and when they can volunteer			1
at the cleanup sites , @entity22 's passion for the work is contagious , and his humor creates an upbeat atmosphere -- something he knows is necessary for the work that they do			2
his team uses skits , mock motivational speeches and music to get the volunteers amped up , and sometimes they might find themselves doing a little karaoke on their @entity126 boat			2
" we do everything in our power to get people excited about it , " @entity2 said			1
" we want people to leave feeling good about what they did so they 'll come back			0
" teams also compete to see who can find the " best " garbage -- a poker - like game in which two bowling balls tops three refrigerators and a message in a bottle trumps everything			0
@entity22 has accumulated what he believes is one of the world 's largest message - in - a - bottle collections , having collected 64 over the years			0
" picking up garbage , it 's tough , miserable and hot			0
we try to make it fun , " he said			1
at the end of the day , the volunteers head back to shore and make a human chain to bring the day 's haul onto the barge and sort it out			1
close to 90 % of what they recover is recycled ; @entity22 says the rest gets disposed of properly			0
he believes that volunteers get a huge sense of accomplishment from seeing the garbage piled up at the end of the cleanup , and he considers that just as important as the amount of trash they help collect			1
" ( i 'm ) creating a chance for people to go out there and do something positive , " he said			0
" talking is great , but it does n't do much at all			0
action is what i 'm about			0
" throughout the year , @entity22 's flotilla travels on rivers throughout the @entity181			0
for the past three years , the group has visited @entity0 , each spring to help clean up a harbor on the @entity4 where the waters are thick with debris			1
during their most recent visit , they collected more than 120,000 pounds of garbage in 14 working days			0
" it 's a really negative deal , the worst thing i 've ever seen ... ( but ) i 've never been to a city that 's had more people coming out saying , ' let 's do something about this			0
' it 's a cool thing , " @entity2 said			1
in addition to the river cleanup , @entity22 has launched a floating classroom barge , where his staff educates high school students and teachers about the damages of pollution on river ecosystems			1
and in 2007 , his nonprofit implemented a program to plant 1 million trees along river shorelines to protect and restore the natural environment			0
the group is halfway to its goal			0
@entity22 says his nonprofit has already held more than 700 cleanups on 23 rivers , but he says that he 's just getting started			2
he views his work as a different kind of service to the country			2
" a lot of people call me a conservationist or an environmentalist , but the thing is i 'm no different than anybody else , " he said			0
" i just want to be known ( as ) a hardworking @entity6			1
" ultimately , @entity22 says , his message is about much more than cleaning rivers			2
he believes his story is proof that anyone can make a difference : " if i had one thing to say , it would n't even be about rivers necessarily			2
it would be about finding ( a ) cause that 's dear to you and taking action			0
... " @entity237 is slow , like a barge or train , ( but ) once it builds momentum , it 's hard to stop			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity52 website at @entity243 and see how to help .			0
