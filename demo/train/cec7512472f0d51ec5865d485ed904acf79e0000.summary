-- to his credit , @entity1 has framed the question just about right			1
on thursday night he said : " how many days have you woken up feeling that something really special was happening in @entity6 ? many of you felt that way on @entity9 four years ago			0
hope and change had a powerful appeal			0
but tonight i 'd ask a simple question : if you felt that excitement when you voted for @entity15 , should n't you feel that way now that he 's president @entity15 ? you know there 's something wrong with the kind of job he 's done as president when the best feeling you had was the day you voted for him			1
the president has n't disappointed you because he wanted to			2
" @entity1 can not win unless thousands of people who voted for @entity15 four years ago abandon him in november			1
@entity15 can not win by asking people if they are better off now than they expected to be four years ago			2
for most @entity6 , myself included , that is surely not the case			0
the expectations for @entity15 , again mine included , were so off - the - charts as to be unachievable			1
nevertheless , we reveled in the fantasy			0
and it was a fantasy			0
how could @entity15 possibly have accomplished much more than he did , given the complexity of the problems , the little power the president has over either the world situation or the domestic economy , and , of course , the deep commitment the @entity48 voiced from the beginning of his term to deny him any progress that required congressional support ? ( the @entity48 @entity54 leader @entity53 was clear			1
in the run - up to the 2010 election he said : " the single most important thing we want to achieve is for president @entity15 to be a one - term president			1
" he was candid at least , defeating @entity15 was more important to him than , say , making progress on the economic challenges facing the country or the seemingly intractable disputes in the @entity65			2
) @entity15 himself began to understand this dilemma near the end of the 2008 campaign			1
he began to talk about the multiple , unreachable and sometimes conflicting dreams and hopes that the electorate had put on him , a process with which he had readily colluded in his quest for power			0
so , from day one of his presidency , the challenge for @entity15 was not what he could accomplish , but whether he could do the tough work of leadership			2
in two dramatic cases , he showed he could -- launching the risky mission that killed @entity82 and plowing ahead with the comprehensive health care bill after @entity85 's win in @entity86			0
the work of getting elected is about pandering to your own people , telling them what they want to hear			0
@entity15 in 2008 and @entity1 in 2012 have pandered with the best of them , albeit with different approaches			1
@entity15 pandered by talking about his aspirations so abstractly ( " hope and change " ) that everyone could believe he was talking to them individually			2
@entity1 did it by taking any position on any issue that the @entity48 base wanted to hear , regardless of whether it was consistent with his past views or made any sense			0
the work of leadership is about telling your own people the hard truths they need to hear or , to say it more sharply , disappointing your own people at a rate they can absorb			0
@entity1 is counting on the possibility that the inevitable disappointment in @entity15 that many people feel and the gap between their always unrealistic expectations and the hard realities are so large that he can wean enough of them away and sneak into the @entity125 where if he and @entity113 really try to wrestle with the tough issues they , too , will repeat the same syndrome , disappointing their own people at a rate they can absorb			1
the advantage that the @entity1 / @entity113 team will have over @entity15 is the expectations for them will be so low that the inevitable disappointment will be much less four years from now			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity133 .			0

@entity133 : @entity1 drew attention to 2008 expectations for president @entity15
inevitably , he says , @entity15 could n't meet the high expectations his *followers* had
@entity1 in 2012 and @entity15 in 2008 pandered to their *audiences* to gain votes , he says
@entity133 : pandering is how you get elected ; leadership is about what you do in office
