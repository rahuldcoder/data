@entity0 -- @entity3 's campaign will stop advertising on several web sites that have vilified @entity5 as unpatriotic and , in one case , compared the @entity8 nominee - in - waiting to @entity9			1
@entity3 's campaign says it 's getting its ads off web sites that vilify @entity5			1
a spokesman for @entity3 said monday the campaign was not aware its ads were running on the pro-hillary @entity15 sites			2
he said the campaign has taken steps to block those sites from its online advertising network			0
" when we find stuff like this , we take care of it , " said @entity3 spokesman @entity20			0
@entity3 has made it known he is reaching out to former @entity15 supporters , and there are nearly two hundred well - trafficked blogs and online communities run by former @entity15 supporters who refuse to support @entity5			0
but the three sites on which @entity3 's ads appeared are particularly hostile to the @entity35 senator			1
one web site , called @entity37 , is a group blog written by disaffected @entity15 supporters , some of whom are now supporting @entity3			0
a banner ad featuring @entity3 standing side - by - side with @entity44 was running on the site until monday			0
a recent post on the blog outlined the " simple parallels " between @entity5 and @entity9 , and accused @entity5 's audiences of having the same cult mentality that characterized followers of the @entity52 dictator			1
@entity3 's ads have also shown up on a pro-clinton web site named " @entity55 " that accuses @entity5 of being " spineless , " having " communist influences , " " courting jew haters " and being " in the pocket of @entity58 haters			1
" @entity61 , another anti-obama site that has run @entity3 ads , has called @entity5 a " bold faced liar , a thief , a sexist and a racist			2
" the @entity3 campaign pulled the ads after being notified by @entity1			2
@entity20 said the campaign often has no control over where their ads show up on the @entity72			0
that 's because the campaign uses a third - party vendor -- in this case , @entity77 -- to distribute their banner ads across a broad array of political web sites by searching for certain key words			1
when the campaign is made aware of ads appearing on offensive or irrelevant web sites , @entity20 said , they notify the ad distributor and have the sites added to a list of blocked urls			1
he noted the @entity3 campaign has already blocked " tens of thousands " of such sites			1
it 's not the first time @entity72 ads have placed a campaign on the defensive			0
@entity99 's campaign found itself in the politically awkward position of advertising on the web site @entity103 in late 2007 , prompting the web site to pull the ad shortly after it was discovered			0
last september , @entity5 's campaign removed a campaign advertisement that appeared on the @entity109 page for the controversial book " the @entity116 , " which asserts that a network of influential @entity113 activists hold undue sway over @entity58 foreign policy			2
@entity1 's @entity117 and @entity118 contributed to this report .			0
