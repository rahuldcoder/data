@entity0 -- the leading contenders in @entity4 's upcoming national election kicked off their 12 - day campaign tuesday near the seaside prefecture that was at the heart of last year 's nuclear disaster â € ” and is now a powerful symbol of @entity4 's deepening economic woes			1
the man polls suggest will become the country 's next leader appealed for votes in @entity15 , some 50 kilometers ( 30 miles ) from the site of last year 's nuclear meltdown at the @entity19 power plant			1
@entity20 , leader of the opposition @entity21 ( @entity21 ) , has said that , if elected , he 'll decide within three years whether to restart the nuclear plants that were shut down after an earthquake and tsunami triggered nuclear devastation in march 2011			1
he 's a former prime minister who stepped down in 2007 after just one year in power citing health reasons			1
in his first official campaign speech tuesday , @entity20 focused on economic arguments , saying he will act to counter deflation , weaken the yen and promote economic stability			1
" we 'll regain economic power in @entity4 , " he said			1
nearly two years after the nuclear meltdown , hundreds of thousands of people remain in temporary homes as the government , led by the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) , sees its support slip away			2
the economy is weakening , and policymakers are under enormous pressure to restore communities affected by the disaster			0
since assuming power in september 2011 , current prime minister @entity48 has faced fierce resistance to his plan to raise government revenue by doubling the 5 % sales tax by october 2015			1
he 's dealing with an economy that 's contracting -- by 3.5 % between july and september -- after years of economic malaise			2
if @entity57 continues to shrink this quarter , the country will officially enter another recession			0
" any prime minister who has seriously taken up the cause of instituting or increasing an existing consumption tax rate -- if they succeeded or failed -- has lost power , so in that sense you have to give @entity48 his dues , " said @entity59 , founder of consultancy @entity60			1
last month , @entity48 agreed to dissolve the lower house of parliament , clearing the way for an election on december 16 , as part of a deal to secure support for a crucial financial bill from the @entity21			1
it was a risky move , and one that a poll released on monday suggested would lead to @entity48 's removal from power , just one year after assuming office			2
the poll , conducted by @entity84 last weekend , suggests the @entity21 retained a 5 % lead over the @entity40			0
twenty percent of respondents said they 'd vote for the @entity21 if the lower house election was held now , compared to 15 % who 'd vote for @entity48 's @entity40			1
@entity48 also launched his re-election campaign in @entity19 prefecture , at the @entity92 station , where he told supporters they faced a clear choice			2
" the question in this lower house election is whether we can move forward with what we should do or whether we turn back to the old politics , " he said			0
he has promised to phase out nuclear power by 2040 , seizing on a popular backlash against the energy source since last year 's nuclear disaster			1
it 's a policy pledged by other smaller parties vying for votes in an election that 's expected to see 1,500 candidates compete for 480 lower house seats			0
according to the polls , neither party is expected to win a majority , although @entity60 says a survey of polls shows that the @entity21 is on track for a coalition win , with its traditional ally the @entity118			2
amid flagging support for the major players , smaller parties have proliferated including the @entity122 , led by @entity123			0
the controversial former governor of @entity125 is perhaps best known outside the country for triggering a diplomatic spat with @entity128 over his move to buy disputed islands in the @entity131			0
earlier this year , he urged residents to donate cash to fund the purchase of the islands @entity4 calls @entity135 and @entity128 refers to as @entity135			2
the @entity4 government eventually stepped in to buy the islands from private owners , provoking a sharp rebuke from @entity139 and @entity141 protests across @entity128			2
in the @entity84 poll , 9 % of respondents said they 'd vote for @entity123 's @entity122 , the same proportion who said they 'd give him their vote last week , indicating that his rising popularity may have stalled			0
@entity59 said that it 's unlikely that this election will give marginal parties enough votes to influence the parliament			0
" i 'm convinced that these minor parties are going to remain minor parties , " he said			0
" they grab the attention of the media , they 're old style curmudgeons but they wo n't gain any political influence			0
" whether the combined leadership of the @entity21 and the @entity118 is able to introduce policies to contend with @entity4 's major structural challenges ` remains to be seen , @entity59 said			1
if it ca n't , more political waves could be made when the upper house votes in an scheduled election next year , he said			0
@entity1 's @entity168 contributed to this report .			0

@entity4 's 12 - day election season begins with campaign speeches in @entity19
polls show the @entity21 is likely to return to power , led by @entity20
@entity20 is a former prime minister who stepped down citing health reasons in 2007
