uncertainty normally comes with the new			2
this year 's @entity2 presidential elections , though , have been like no other			2
after sunday 's polls gave president @entity5 , from the left - wing @entity6 ( @entity8 ) , another four - year term with a narrow margin of victory , @entity2 embarked on a guessing exercise about what her next government will look like			1
on the surface it does n't seem a vote for change , but the president knows it should be			1
there were exuberant celebrations in the @entity8 camp and frustration in the faces of supporters of the defeated centrist candidate , @entity27 , from @entity28			2
but no one could say for sure what the result means for the next four years			1
since massive street protests in june 2013 called for change in @entity2 politics and economy , that word has been around in almost every political statement -- including @entity5 's victory speech on sunday night			1
as she addressed supporters in @entity41 , the president said she had not forgotten the message from the streets			2
" the most repeated word in these elections has been ' change '			2
and i know that i have been re-elected to make the big changes the @entity2 society demands			2
" @entity5 had already hinted that her second term will be different from her first -- " new government , new ideas " was her campaign slogan			1
" i want to be a much better president than i 've been so far " , she said on sunday , while also talking about " building bridges " with political opponents			2
the challenges , in the economy and in politics , are huge			0
so what should @entity2 expect ? in her speech , she mentioned wide - ranging political reform			0
a new direction in the economy ? unlikely			0
a friendlier approach towards a fragmented @entity67 ? who knows			0
a more positive dialogue with the private sector ? possibly			0
or nothing of that sort			0
@entity73 is still to be revealed			0
almost half of the country wanted a different outcome			0
@entity5 won with 51.6 % of the valid votes , while @entity27 received 48.4 % -- the closest presidential election result in 25 years			1
the president 's performance was 1.4 million votes short of the 55.8 million she got four years ago , while the opposition increased their base from 43.7 million in 2010 to 50.9 million			1
@entity2 endured three months of a fiercely fought campaign -- or as some have called it , " dirty " and " shameful " after a number of personal attacks that were both baseless and tasteless			2
many voters lost their composure too , with political differences ruining friendships and keeping relatives apart			0
a wish that something new would come out of this battle was evident in late august when , after the tragic death of socialist candidate @entity101 in a plane crash , his running mate and environmentalist @entity99 took the helm on their ticket			0
in a few weeks opinion polls showed @entity99 ahead of @entity5 in a second round simulation			1
but the scaremongering from the government 's camp that @entity99 's lack of political support could lead her government to collapse made her support drop as quickly as it had risen			0
the task of trying to dethrone @entity5 in the second round fell to @entity27 , with support from a defeated @entity99			1
@entity2 watched the sixth edition of the same pt vs. @entity28 face - off that has marked every @entity2 presidential election since 1994			0
@entity5 was re-elected thanks to her party 's record in power			1
in the 12 years that the @entity8 has governed @entity2 , extreme poverty has been reduced by more than half			0
social programs that increased the income of the poorest now reach 14 million families , most of them in northern regions			0
in those areas , @entity5 easily won the trust of the voters , beating her opponent by margins that reached 70 %			1
but she came close to losing the election due to poor recent economic results and the word that many today associate with her party 's red star : corruption			0
although the unemployment rate remains low , at 5 % , analysts expect layoffs to increase in the months to come			2
@entity2 's economy is technically in recession -- its gdp fell in the last two quarters -- and the @entity151 predicts only 0.3 % growth in 2014			1
members of @entity154 's @entity142 were convicted and jailed for illegal campaign funding and the bribing of congressmen			0
and a new ( and still ongoing ) corruption scandal at the heart of @entity160 , the @entity2 state oil company , hit the government at its core			0
poor economic data and sleaze are issues that tend to shock and concern the better - off and well - educated , mainly located in the south of @entity2 , where @entity27 performed very well			0
in the @entity167 , the richest and most populated , he got 64 % of the vote			1
massive street protests , a stalled economy , corruption ; @entity5 survived it all -- just			1
her main tasks now are to unite a divided nation , find a way of making @entity2 's economy grow again , bring down an inflation rate that is stubbornly high ( 6.75 % ) and change something			1
the @entity2 president knows that she has not won this contest because of what she 's promised to do in the future , as she did n't even present a formal plan for her second term			1
she 's won because of the past , and the future is still being planned			1
in opinion polls , 70 % of @entity2 have repeatedly said they wanted change in the federal government			1
unsure about how to achieve that , they decided to close their eyes , keep things as they are and hope for the best .			0

with more than 99 % of votes counted , *incumbent* @entity5 had 51.59 % of the vote
@entity198 : result was n't a vote for change , but the president knows she must make changes
@entity198 : @entity5 did n't win because of her plan for the future -- she won for past performance
