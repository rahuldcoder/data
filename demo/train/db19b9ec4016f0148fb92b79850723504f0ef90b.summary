@entity0 -- remembering @entity2 , who died this week , is n't hard , because first of all , who can forget a name like that ? @entity2			1
perfect , that is , after you 've won two terms as leader of the @entity11 of @entity12 and a @entity13 , traveled the world , acquired celebrity friends like @entity16 and become one of the most famous @entity18 on the planet			1
not so perfect in 1969 , when you 're 25 years old and a soon - to - be - divorced mother of two living in @entity23			0
try making a dentist appointment with a name like @entity2 or @entity26 or @entity27 : half the time people would think it 's a crank call and hang up on you			1
but that was the least of her problems			0
@entity2 's biggest problem was being an @entity18 in 1969			1
we were so square , and so invisible			0
why was she in @entity23 then , instead of @entity12 ? she had moved there with her family ( she was one of 11 children ) because the @entity40 said there was n't any future in @entity18 living on reservations			1
so it began a program imaginatively called @entity46 , which moved @entity18 to cities			1
it was n't a terrible idea , just a bad one , at least for most @entity18			1
was life better in @entity52 or @entity53 or @entity23 than life in @entity55 , @entity56 , or @entity57 ? sometimes yes , usually no. the thing is , it was n't clear where any of this was going			0
what was even the point of being @entity18 , anyway ? why ca n't there be a future back home ? why is being an unemployed aerospace worker in @entity67 better than being unemployed in @entity68 ? @entity2 may have been pondering these questions when something amazing happened			1
in a daring nighttime invasion , a few dozen @entity18 college students took over the abandoned federal prison on @entity74 and reclaimed it on behalf of a group they had just invented , called @entity18 of all tribes			1
this was electrifying because @entity18 in those days did not stage daring nighttime invasions and break laws and trespass on federal property -- any property , for that matter			1
that occupation of @entity74 in november 1969 lasted for 19 months			1
@entity2 visited the ragtag settlement frequently , and said it changed her life			1
she was n't the only one			0
i moved to @entity23 in 1977 , and met @entity2 and other " veterans " of @entity74			1
the occupation was endlessly debated -- so many good and bad things happened during those months -- but nobody argued how important it was , and how much had changed			0
we were n't so boring , and we were becoming visible			0
more than anything else , @entity74 signaled new possibilities			2
@entity2 saw them clearly and seized every one			2
she finished college , divorced , moved with her two daughters back to @entity12 , and began her own series of audacious takeovers : running and revolutionizing community development projects for the tribe , then successfully running for principal chief of the @entity11			0
she served two terms and became an icon			0
just like @entity74 , none of this was supposed to happen			2
did i mention she was a woman ? we @entity18 in the @entity40 talk a good game about being matriarchal and so forth , but it was no accident that in the 20th century no woman had lead a major tribe before her			2
( the unofficial logo of the @entity119 was the @entity121 bunny			0
@entity122 ! ) so she had no chance to lead her nation , but did so anyway			0
the other reason none of this was suppose to happen is her near - fatal car crash in 1979 , her kidney transplant , her battles with breast cancer , lymphoma , and numerous operations			0
she beat them all -- all except pancreatic cancer			0
the health disasters were horrible and unrelenting , but i bet you dollars to donuts @entity2 would tell you it was n't nearly as bad as the tribal politics			1
@entity74 feels like a million years ago			2
we have profitable @entity18 casinos and a @entity145 museum and many strong women leading our tribes and communities			2
@entity18 college students are getting @entity150 's instead of criminal records			2
some people , including me , wonder if we 've lost the kind of daring that would lead college kids to break into an abandoned prison seeking some kind of justice , and a woman to find a calling there that would change a piece of the world			0
and this is where i write she was tough as nails and one of a kind , and we wo n't see the likes of her ever again			0
it 's all true , but there 's something more			0
her life made a new future possible one that is still unwritten			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .			2

@entity181 says @entity2 was one of the most *accomplished* , famous @entity18
she was *inspired* by the @entity74 occupation in 1969 to become politically involved
he says she endured health disasters , other *challenges* and *persevered*
@entity181 : her life made a new future possible
