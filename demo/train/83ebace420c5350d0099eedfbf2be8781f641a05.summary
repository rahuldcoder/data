-- @entity1 , a terror suspect who has been held at @entity2 , @entity3 , pleaded guilty wednesday to all charges as part of a deal that requires him to testify against other detainees			1
@entity1 , 32 , is expected to spend up to 19 years behind bars in exchange for the agreement , according to @entity13 col. @entity12 , the presiding military commission judge			1
" if i keep my side of the bargain , they 'll keep their side of the bargain , " @entity1 said during the proceeding wednesday			1
he was charged with conspiracy , murder and attempted murder in violation of the law of war , providing material support for terrorism and spying			1
@entity12 pronounced @entity1 guilty wednesday and said the sentencing is expected to take place in four years			1
the defendant will be required to provide testimony against his fellow detainees during those years leading up to the sentencing			0
he 'll then receive credit for time served , leaving up to 15 years on his sentence , @entity12 said			0
in the deal , @entity1 -- who had faced the prospect of life in prison -- has agreed to be interviewed by government investigators without his own legal counsel present , provided that the government gives his attorney reasonable notice			1
he also agreed not to disclose information about his capture or the conditions surrounding how he and other detainees were treated			0
@entity1 , who attended high school in @entity53 , was held for more than three years at secret @entity55 prisons and " subjected to an aggressive @entity55 detention and interrogation program notable for its elaborate planning and ruthless application of torture , " his lawyers have said , according to court documents			1
details of @entity1 's torture claims were redacted in the filing , but @entity1 's attorneys have said he suffers " severe physical and psychological trauma from which he is unlikely ever to recover fully " as a result of his ordeal			1
asked earlier about @entity1 's claims , then @entity55 spokesman @entity71 told @entity0 , " @entity55 's terrorist interrogation effort has always been small , carefully run , lawful and highly productive			1
fewer than 100 hardened terrorists have gone through the program since it began in 2002 , and of those , less than a third required any special methods of questioning			0
the @entity79 does not conduct or condone torture			0
" as part of the agreement reached wednesday , @entity1 is also no longer recommended to be housed at the island 's facility 's @entity83 , where high - value detainees have been kept			1
" @entity1 was tortured prior to his arrival at @entity2 , but he made a decision despite that , and despite everything that 's transpired in his life , he made a decision to accept responsibility for his actions and to really try to achieve some measure of redemption in his life , " said @entity87 , one of @entity1 's civilian attorneys			1
" the @entity79 government should accept responsibility for what happened to him , just the way that he accepted responsibility today for his actions and the actions of his co-conspirators			0
" another civilian defense attorney for @entity1 said her client has " taken a leap of faith			2
" " and he 's taken a leap of faith that this process will work the way that we 're all intending it to work , " said @entity114			0
but the overall agreement has prompted controversy over @entity1 's treatment and what information can be gleaned after years behind bars			2
" any plea deal and testimony by @entity130 must be seen in the context of his years of secret , incommunicado detention and torture at the hands of the @entity55 , and the prospect of trial by an unfair military commissions system , " said @entity125 , a senior lawyer for the @entity126 who was at @entity2 to observe the proceedings			2
the @entity79 military said @entity1 traveled from @entity53 to @entity140 , @entity141 , in 2002 to help @entity143 plan attacks in the @entity79 and elsewhere			2
the military said @entity1 conspired with @entity144 , the accused mastermind of the september 11 terrorist attacks , to blow up underground storage tanks in the @entity79			2
the government said @entity1 had also recorded a " martyr video " and donned an explosive vest and waited in a mosque where then - @entity141 president @entity150 was expected			0
the plan failed when @entity150 did not show up			0
he also was accused of giving $ 50,000 in @entity143 funds to a @entity155 - based @entity143 affiliate , which then gave the money to @entity157 to fund the august 2003 bombing of the @entity159 in @entity160 , @entity161			0
that incident killed 11 people and wounded at least 181 others			0
@entity0 's @entity165 contributed to this report .			0
