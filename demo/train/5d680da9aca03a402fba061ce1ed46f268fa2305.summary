-- @entity1 is one of @entity3 's most successful stand - up comedians , but fans @entity5 do n't get to enjoy their native son live on stage as much as they 'd like			1
" i have n't really done comedy in @entity3 , " he says			1
" i did it for a year before i moved to the @entity10			2
i go back and do it now for a couple of weeks a year but , to be honest , i do it because you got to visit your mom			2
it was in @entity18 where @entity20 ' career really began to flourish			1
however , success did n't come without a few lumps along the way			2
many people are aware of the 2006 @entity26 incident where @entity1 was viciously attacked on stage			1
he recounts this story in our video interview			0
( and , yes , we 've got the actual footage			0
) but there was also the time ( again in @entity35 ) when he , along with his friend and girlfriend , fell victim to a home invasion that led to having his car stolen and @entity20 being tied up and sliced in the head with a machete			1
this story was told in hilarious detail on the @entity48 radio show , where @entity1 explained that the cops caught the intruders and pretty much nailed them for everything , including grievous bodily harm , aggravated robbery and attempted rape			1
" they also got ' em for possession of drugs , which was brilliant because they were my drugs , " he says of the little bag of weed the robbers took from his house			0
later , when the police questioned him about the drugs , explaining that his fingerprints were all over the bag , @entity1 replied , " they made me touch it			1
" over the years , @entity20 has established himself as one of the funniest and most irreverent comedians on stage			2
and , for a good long while , he was also known as being a bit of a heavy drinker			0
but those days are over ; they ended rather abruptly when his doctor told him he had an enlarged liver			0
to this , he jokes , " you 'd think a large one would be able to handle more pressure			0
" fortunately , his comedy is as strong as ever , and a sober @entity20 is rapidly becoming a bigger name throughout the @entity83			1
of course , he still performs occasionally back in @entity84 you know			0
discussion : watch our video interview above and share your thoughts on racism vs bigotry .			0

@entity1 is a comedian from @entity3 , but he 's discovered more fame in @entity18
@entity20 has *turned* true events , like a home invasion , into *inspiration* for his comedy
his comedy is catching on in the @entity103 , but @entity1 still likes to perform in @entity3
