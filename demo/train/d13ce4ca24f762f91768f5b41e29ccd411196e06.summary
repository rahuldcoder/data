-- three major @entity2 airlines on saturday confirmed that pilots were complying with @entity5 government demands that it be notified of plans to traverse the newly declared air defense zone over the @entity9			1
the demands from @entity11 have resulted in tensions with @entity13 and the @entity2			1
on saturday , @entity15 , @entity2 and @entity16 airlines told @entity0 that its pilots were following @entity19 's advice and complying with @entity11 's " air defense identification zone			1
" a senior official in @entity2 president @entity23 's administration said friday that commercial airlines are being told to abide by @entity11 's instruction , even if the @entity2 government does n't recognize it			2
" we ... are advising for safety reasons that they comply with notices to airmen , which @entity33 always advises , " the official said			0
@entity13 resists @entity5 demand two major @entity13 airlines have refused to comply with @entity5 's declaration			1
the @entity13 government said saturday it has asked the @entity40 to address @entity5 's designation of the new defense zone , the @entity38 reported			1
the @entity43 said the government 's proposal at an @entity40 meeting friday in @entity47 called the @entity5 zone a threat to aviation safety , @entity38 reported			1
@entity38 said @entity51 , @entity52 and the @entity2 supported the proposal , with @entity5 opposed			2
fears of unintended consequences the latest @entity2 advice to comply with the defense zone requirements reflects fears that the back - and - forth between the two sides could have unintended consequences involving not just opposing troops , but innocent civilians as well			1
it 's a subtle change from two days earlier , when the @entity64 said " the @entity2 government generally expects that @entity2 carriers operating internationally " comply with other countries ' mandates , rather than directing them to			0
opinion : @entity5 's balance between sovereignty and stability last saturday , @entity5 announced the creation of the zone over several islands it and @entity13 have both claimed			1
the two countries have been sharply at odds over those isles , which are believed to be near large reserves of natural resources			0
@entity84 rejected the new zone , as well as @entity11 's insistence that aircraft entering it identify themselves and file flight plans			2
they were joined by @entity92 and @entity19 , with secretary of state @entity93 saying the move would " only increase tensions in the region and create risks of an incident			0
" since then , there 's been no backing down			0
on friday morning , for instance , @entity5 scrambled fighter jets after @entity2 and @entity13 military aircraft entered its disputed air defense zone , according to a @entity5 military official			1
@entity2 military flights ' not changing ' col. @entity107 , a @entity5 air force spokesman , said in @entity11 that the two @entity2 and 10 @entity13 aircraft were targets of monitoring in the zone			1
he said the @entity5 air force and navy were identifying and monitoring all foreign warplanes in the zone			2
a @entity2 military official told @entity0 that at least one @entity2 unarmed military aircraft and several @entity13 military aircraft flew through the zone friday without incident			1

" this is status quo , " the official said			0
" we are not changing what we are doing			0
we are not trying to make a point with @entity5			2
we fly @entity2 aircraft daily in international airspace in the region			0
" the official said the aircraft were not b - 52s , though the @entity2 did fly two of those type of planes through the zone monday as part of what the @entity141 described as a preplanned military exercise			0
@entity92 said its military sent a plane on a routine patrol flight into the zone on tuesday without alerting @entity5			1
a @entity149 official said such flights are carried out twice a week and would continue despite @entity5 's declaration			1
can @entity5 keep up the monitoring ? @entity2 officials said they did not know how @entity5 would be able to monitor the flight zone , given its lack of midair refueling capability and limitations of its early warning radar aircraft			2
" it is indeed the right of every country to defend its airspace , and also to make sure that its territorial integrity , its sovereignty , are safeguarded , " @entity158 , @entity5 's ambassador to the @entity159 , told reporters tuesday			0
" this is a normal arrangement			0
" why @entity5 's new air defense zone has incensed neighbors on wednesday , @entity2 ambassador to @entity13 @entity171 offered a different view : " unilateral actions like those taken by @entity5 , with their announcement of an @entity9 air defense identification zone , undermine security and constitute an attempt to change the status quo in the @entity9 , " she told reporters in @entity84			1
" this only serves to increase tensions in the region			0
" @entity13 and @entity5 have a lot at stake in maintaining their delicate relationship : last year , trade between the two countries totaled more than $ 333 billion , according to the @entity191			2
