@entity0 , @entity1 -- horror has given way to acceptance ; it can be seen on people 's faces			1
but desperation surfaces everywhere : in the rubble still strewn about the streets , in the steadily rising piles of garbage , in the 1,300 makeshift camps that still house so many people			1
four months on , the tragedy of the massive january 12 earthquake is fresh			1
relief operations thwarted widespread hunger here and so far , there have been no reports of killer disease outbreaks			2
but @entity0 is very much running in emergency mode			2
no humanitarian worker will argue with that sad fact			2
despite the efforts and good intentions of a host of foreigners and a government that got a wake - up call , progress has been timidly slow			1
the future has a different meaning now for @entity1 such as @entity34 , who worries not about where to enroll her three daughters in school but how to get them up off the floor fast enough when the rains start falling			1
@entity1 earthquake special she poured cement around her shack in the city 's central @entity45 plaza			1
but that does n't keep the water out or her girls safe at night			1
the future means getting through the night and when the sun comes back out , scrounging together a meal			1
on the streets , a bright spot : the sight of schoolchildren in uniforms			2
but only 700 of the 5,000 or so schools around the @entity1 capital have opened			1
some were destroyed ; others are occupied by the displaced			2
another welcomed sight : hundreds of street vendors , many of whom are women , sit under a rainbow of umbrellas to sell mangoes , plantains and coconuts			0
or they display a collision of goods in one basket -- shoe polish , spaghetti , shampoo , cigarettes and molasses			0
these are snippets of life as it was once , before that fatal day			1
give us work -- not handouts in the aftermath of what most @entity1 refer to as " the catastrophe , " people asked for food			1
they patiently lined up for hours to receive a sack of rice , a quart of oil			0
the lines are gone , along with the massive aid drops			1
international agencies are wary that too much help could stymie the local economy			0
now the two million @entity1 living in squalid makeshift camps -- and countless others living in the homes of generous family and friends -- need jobs			1
they do n't want handouts ; they just want money so they can feed themselves			0
" we are willing to work -- work hard -- for money , but we need jobs , " said @entity111 , a coordinator at a new camp in @entity113			0
some earn a few dollars here and there through work - for - cash programs			0
they clear debris off the streets or clean latrines in the camps			1
these are hardly high - quality jobs , but being employed anywhere will earn you envy			0
more than 100,000 @entity1 found work this way			1
but that 's only a sliver of the population			1
almost four million people live in @entity0 , a city designed for 250,000			1
@entity1 lived in congested neighborhoods and shanties before the quake			1
imagine those conditions compounded -- a family of six eating , sitting and sleeping in a space that 's hardly bigger than the sofa in your den. when home is a place of last resort to shield people from the potential danger of the rainy season , aid agencies have started building transitional homes and have relocated thousands to new camps on the city 's perimeter			1
almost 5,000 went to @entity113 , a stark place that evokes images of a military base in the @entity159 desert			0
void of trees , the tropical sun beats down hard , and soaring temperatures make furnaces of the tents			0
it 's not a place residents say they would choose			1
but this is where the government had access to land , so this is where people were brought to ride out the rains			1
here , at least , they are not at risk of being washed away by torrents of water or in mudslides down steep , denuded hills			0
@entity113 has its own problems			0
it 's far from the city , and it can cost a camp resident an astronomical $ 1.25 to take tap - taps , the colorful shared taxis , to central @entity0			1
no one at @entity113 could afford that journey			0
but they said they had to figure out a way to go where the jobs were			0
" we help each other			0
we share food , " said @entity111 , the camp coordinator			0
" but the situation is getting more tense			0
people have nothing so they resort to stealing sometimes			1
" he complained about the lack of services and schools at @entity113			0
but aid agencies do n't want people to get too comfortable here			1
eventually , people have to try and regain their livelihoods in the neighborhoods where they were established			1
" you want people to go home , " said @entity210 , spokesman for the @entity211			1
" the last resort is a place like @entity113			0
" @entity210 said camp managers have been asking @entity1 's homeless this question : what will it take for you to move out of a camp ? the answers are varied , and the problems are n't easily resolved			1
not even the safe places feel safe all over the city , buildings are being marked green , yellow and red			2
some already say : " to demolish			0
" but even after an engineer has marked a home green for " safe , " people are reluctant to return			1
the @entity233 estimates only 9 percent of those with green houses have gone back			0
what if there is another earthquake ? @entity239 , an architect working with the government on relocation , said incentives for people to go home -- $ 50 and a few provisions -- are being created			2
but so far , nothing has been doled out			0
for many , @entity239 recognized , it 's impossible to go back to the spot where their house once stood because there is no place to dispose of the rubble			2
in this city of renters , landlords are refusing to accept people who can not pay the back rent for the four months they have been gone			1
many of the displaced can no longer even afford the monthly amount they were paying before			0
and as time marches on , many landowners want to evict displaced people so the buildings can be used as intended			2
what if your child could not go to school because the classrooms were occupied by the homeless ? what if you were homeless and had no place to shelter your children except at the neighborhood school ? it 's a tough call , especially for humanitarian workers who do n't believe in forced evictions			2
but at the same time , @entity210 said , " we recognize the landowners have legitimate concerns			0
" these are municipal issues that will have to be dealt with by the local government , @entity210 said			0
but it wo n't be easy			0
ask @entity285 , who helps manage a camp in front of the city 's main cathedral			2
@entity285 's response was simple but to the point : why would you leave an encampment that offers you a toilet , a shower , emergency food rations and , yes , even an outdoor movie screen when you have no place to go and no money in your pockets ? he said almost 2,000 people were resettled in february from @entity45 to the cathedral			1
but within days , that many more people from elsewhere had flocked to @entity45			2
" every time we move people , more come because they need services , " he said			2
much is shattered , but not hope @entity1 , who have lived through political turmoil , extreme violence and grinding poverty , will tell you the earthquake was the worst experience of their lives			1
whether a new city can rise from the rubble of @entity0 remains in question , though @entity1 are hopeful something good must come out of an event this tragic			1
they have nothing left but hope			2
that 's why if you peek down lanes on a steamy afternoon , you 'll see a gathering of people under a tent , their arms stretched skyward , their eyes closed			1
and you 'll hear the @entity334			0
you 'll hear it , too , every sunday morning , before the sun gets hot , at @entity337 , the main cathedral in @entity0			0
the building is shattered , but not the congregation 's faith			2
they still come to the place where , every week , they are re-energized by their belief in @entity347			0
several @entity1 said they feared the world 's goodwill would quickly fade now that the throngs of media have left and the spotlight has turned elsewhere			1
@entity353 was one of them			0
she worried she was forgotten , lying on a smelly mattress under three tattered bed sheets that serve as a roof in the @entity45 tent city			0
last month , she gave birth to @entity360 , asleep in a plastic tub under a foldable umbrella			0
life with a newborn in this congested camp , she said , was unbearable			2
" i want to go somewhere else , " she said			0
but where , she worried			0
and who would help her reclaim her life ?			2

four months after massive quake , progress in @entity1 is *painfully* slow
people are *afraid* to return to their homes , even if they *'ve* been *deemed* safe
life in camps is difficult , but for many , it 's the best *option* they have
despite their *tremendous* suffering , many @entity1 hang onto the hope of a better future
