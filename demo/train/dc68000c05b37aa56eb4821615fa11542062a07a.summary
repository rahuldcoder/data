-- it 's a big dilemma : be with your wife for the birth of your first child , or stay at work with the hope of an $ 11 million payday			1
for golfer @entity10 , it 's a no - brainer			1
" there was n't much discussion			0
i brought up the question , she said : ' you 're staying			0
' " @entity10 is one of five players who can claim the $ 10 million jackpot for topping the @entity21 's @entity20 playoff series by winning the $ 1.44 million @entity23 finale in @entity24			1
the 27 - year - old made the best possible start thursday as he tied for the first - round lead with longtime friend @entity28 , who heads the @entity30 standings from second - placed @entity10			1
@entity10 won last week 's @entity31 and was joint runner - up in the second of the four playoff events , so his hopes are high that he can secure his family 's financial future this weekend			1
" my wife is totally on board , " he told the @entity21 website after his four - under - par 66			0
" she 's a golfer			2
she understands what it all means			0
i 've probably got the greatest wife out here			0
" their daughter , to be named @entity46 , is due on september 27 but could arrive earlier			0
@entity10 said if his wife @entity47 does go into labor in the next few days , he does n't want to be told until he completes his round			1
then , with a private jet standing by , he will make the one - hour flight back to @entity52			0
because of the tournament 's restricted 29 - man field -- there would usually be around 150 players for the first two rounds of a regular @entity21 event before the halfway cut -- he will have time to get back to resume playing the next day			2
" i wo n't find out on the course , because my focus may be taken away from the task at hand , " @entity10 said			2
" but after the round 's over with , i will be flying home , spend a few hours and then flying back later that day or the next morning before the round of golf			2
" having a chance to win $ 10 million and our first child on the way -- it 's pretty amazing			1
" last year , @entity74 -- who carded 74 thursday to be well off the pace -- withdrew from the @entity76 while he was leading to be at the birth of his first child			0
" @entity74 did a great thing last year pulling out , " @entity10 said			0
" but i would think if he was in my position with winning , having a chance to win , roughly $ 10 million more , if you had the @entity23 winner 's check and everything , i think it would be maybe a no - brainer to stay put and keep playing and go home in between rounds			1
" impending fatherhood is only adding to the excitement for @entity10 , who partnered the comparatively calm @entity28 in the final group to go out thursday			1
they have known each other since playing at rival schools and progressing through the amateur ranks			0
" he looks like he 's a @entity101 walking slow and nothing affects him , " @entity10 says of the 29 - year - old @entity99 native			2
" and i think i walk slow , but as i 've seen on the coverage last week , it looks like i 'm sprinting around the greens and the golf course ... the emotional level is a little bit different			0
" they were one shot clear of another four players tied for third : masters champion @entity112 , fellow @entity114 @entity113 and @entity115 , plus @entity117 @entity116			0
world no. 1 @entity118 -- who like @entity28 , @entity10 , @entity112 and @entity74 can secure the bumper jackpot with victory sunday no matter where any other player finishes -- was tied for 11th on 69 with @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125			1
if none of the top five win , then the permutations get complicated , but it 's possible for any player in the entire field to claim the $ 10 million with victory .			1
