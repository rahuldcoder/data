-- @entity2 's enemies must be laughing			1
but most of the world is just baffled , mystified at the sight of the world 's most powerful country tangled in a crippling web of its own making			1
the government shutdown is weakening the @entity2 before its allies and its foes			1
it is eroding @entity2 standing and prestige while reducing @entity2 power and influence			1
the democracy that once inspired the world now leaves observers perplexed			1
this , to put it mildly , is not a time when @entity2 can say they feel pride in their government			1
it is a time when @entity2 's partners worry about how much they can rely on the commitments from a nation that claims to be a bastion of democracy and freedom , not to mention efficiency and competence			1
for politicians in @entity38 , and for the @entity2 people , angry and frustrated with the increasingly partisan and dysfunctional government , the shutdown that started on tuesday looks like a battle over domestic politics			1
for the rest of the world , the closure of @entity2 government institutions says @entity2 is growing small , small - minded and unreliable			1
a small band of extreme right - wing politicians could n't win the debate , or the vote , or the legal argument over health care , so they decided to close down the government instead			2
a system that allows that to happen is dangerously flawed and in urgent need of repairs			0
the self - destructive tactic is undermining @entity2 strategic interests while the country 's rivals make strides on the global stage			1
while @entity66 's @entity65 unabashedly strengthens his position , while @entity68 expands its global influence , while @entity2 faces enormous challenges , the president of the @entity2 and countless top officials are expending energy on a futile exercise			1
in recent days -- while @entity74 burned , @entity73 maneuvered and @entity75 wondered if the @entity2 will send the global economy back into recession -- @entity2 government officials were busy making plans for a shutdown : deciding what offices will be open , what employees would write on their e-mail autoreplies during the shutdown			1
in the final hours before the deadline , the @entity85 was in session and @entity88 was meeting with world leaders			1
but his mind was presumably on the blackmail and on the impending shutdown			2
americans were also distracted , irritated			0
in a world filled with crises , the ego - massaging spectacle from @entity38 managed to steal the spotlight			1
@entity2 strategic considerations now take a back seat			1
@entity2 efforts to counter @entity68 's influence by strengthening ties with @entity106 countries have to wait			1
the long - planned visit to @entity106 by the president was cut in half to attend to this unnecessary crisis			1
an aide to @entity112 in @entity75 gen. @entity113 said the general would cut his travel because of the shutdown			2
defense secretary @entity117 correctly noted the shutdown would raise doubts among key allies and would damage @entity2 credibility			1
it is impossible to fully calculate the ways in which this hurts @entity2 's standing			1
@entity2 officials cooperate on important projects in every field with international organizations			2
their partners are learning they can not rely on them			0
the @entity2 used to have one of the most respected forms of government on the planet			2
@entity38 was never morally crystalline and pure , but enough respect for the principles of democracy made people in other nations yearn to build a similar system , one in which people with differing opinions debated their positions , voted , and accepted the outcome			0
who would want to copy the @entity2 system now ? the last time the government shut down , in 1995 , i was in @entity150			1
back then , as we awaited the arrival of @entity154 forces , we heard of the shutdown			0
it seemed inconceivable such a thing could happen during a time of crisis			0
but at least president @entity160 and the @entity161 led by house speaker @entity162 were willing to compromise			0
and they were n't fighting over an issue that had already been triply settled in @entity165 , in the courts and at the ballot box			0
and back then the economy was strong , more resilient , better able to withstand the showdown			0
today 's dogmatic politicians , protected by like - minded zealots in their districts , are looking at their job in the narrowest possible way			2
they may want to hurt @entity88 ; they may want to blackmail the president into doing away with his health care program			0
what they are doing is weakening @entity2 and its alliances			2
they are hurting those people in other lands who are trying to make the case that democracy is the best system			0
from travel agents in @entity188 to newspaper columnists in @entity190 , people are trying to explain the inexplicable			0
tourists from overseas have been blocked from visiting the @entity192			0
international meetings have been canceled , research delayed			0
the @entity190 columnist @entity195 tried to break down for his readers how one side would close down the government to stop the health insurance that other countries take for granted			0
but he concluded that it all " seems mad			0
" a journalist in @entity203 wrote about her driver and translator laughing at the @entity2			2
" so much for the world 's great superpower , " she tweeted , " it 's closed			2
" @entity2 looks weak , flailing			2
set aside for a moment the impact of the shutdown on 800,000 federal workers and their families			0
forget just for now the anguish of the people accepted for clinical trials on cancer drugs at the @entity217			0
forget the businesses that rely on income from providing services to government workers , or from tourists visiting national parks			0
forget the parents who have no place to take their children with the closure of @entity229 - funded programs			0
put to the side for a moment the ripples of damage caused within the @entity2 by this exercise in political extremism			2
think instead about the impact this has on @entity2 's international standing and global interests			1
the people who caused this travesty are diminishing their country			0
perhaps the knowledge that @entity2 's enemies are enjoying the spectacle will give them pause ; probably not			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity248 .			0

@entity2 's enemies may rejoice , but the rest of the world is mystified , writes @entity252
how can the most powerful country get tangled in a web of its own making ?
she says it *discourages* the champions of democracy around the world , *encourages* *dictators*
@entity252 : @entity2 leaders wasting time on shutdown , rather than *focusing* on long - term strategy
