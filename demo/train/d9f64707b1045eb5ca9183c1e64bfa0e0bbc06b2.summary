@entity0 -- police in @entity3 said friday they have seized what could be the parts for @entity7 's first firearm made using @entity9 printing -- but later said more testing is needed to establish if this is the case			1
an initial news release from @entity2 said officers had found " a 3d printer and what is suspected to be a @entity15 and trigger which could be fitted together to make a viable 3d gun " when they searched locations thursday in the @entity20 area , near @entity21 in northwest @entity3			1
but after doubts were raised , the force released a second statement stressing that the parts were still being examined			2
" we need to be absolutely clear that at this stage , we can not categorically say we have recovered the component parts for a 3d gun , " assistant chief constable @entity26 said			2
" what we have seized are items that need further forensic testing by national ballistics experts to establish whether they can be used in the construction of a genuine , viable firearm			2
" we will also be conducting a thorough analysis of computers we have recovered to establish any evidence of a blueprint on how to construct such a weapon			0
" @entity45 - based tech blog @entity43 reported that it appeared the items police suspected of being gun components were in fact spare parts for the 3d printer			1
the raid that netted the items was part of a planned week of action against criminal gangs in @entity21 , police said			2
a man has been arrested on suspicion of making gunpowder and is being questioned			1
@entity9 printed guns a boon for criminals ? in his statement , @entity26 said the seizure had prompted discussion around the potential threats posed by 3 - d printing			1
" clearly the fact we have seized a 3d printer and have intelligence about the possible production of a weapon using this technology is of concern			0
it ( is ) prudent we establish exactly what these parts can be used for and whether they pose any threat , " he said			0
" what this has also done is open up a wider debate about the emerging threat these next generation of weapons might pose			0
" printing instructions others have also raised concerns about the potential for 3 - d printing to be used to create weapons			1
@entity45 requires group to remove @entity9 gun instructions from its website this year , the @entity94 ordered @entity95 , a nonprofit group set up by a @entity97 law student , to remove instructions for printing a handgun with a 3 - d printer from its website			1
video shows test - firing of @entity9 printed handgun the group 's founder , @entity104 , had posted a video online showing a single shot being fired from " @entity108 , " a plastic handgun that , with the exception of a metal firing pin and a piece of metal included to comply with the @entity114 , was assembled entirely from parts made with a @entity9 printer			1
@entity104 complied with the order , but not before the design had been downloaded more than 100,000 times			0
the @entity120 in @entity0 subsequently acquired two models of the @entity123 pistol , which were put on display last month as part of a design exhibition			0
the @entity127 in @entity0 also has a liberator on display			0
