-- the " mommy war " between stay - at - home and working mothers is in danger of being overshadowed by another maddening contest : the one between mothers in the @entity4 and @entity5			1
two recent books , @entity10 's " @entity15 " and @entity17 's " @entity16 , " make the case that @entity5 parents raise kids who behave and eat far better than their @entity4 counterparts			1
this month , the @entity19 debut of the @entity21 bestseller by @entity5 philosopher @entity22 , " the conflict : how modern motherhood undermines the status of women , " is already causing a stir			1
@entity22 argues that overwhelming numbers of @entity5 mamans manage to work full - time and have several kids because they have n't succumbed to intensive ideals of motherhood , most of all @entity4 - style " natural mothering			1
" think extended breastfeeding , nonmedicalized birth , co-sleeping , and cloth diapers			0
commentators are already jumping on @entity22 's polemic as mommy war fodder			1
does @entity40 oppress women ? is the environmental movement , or feminism , to blame ? it 's been a busy season indeed for chroniclers of the faux mommy wars			2
but as usual , that war is more farce than reality			2
the global battle between mamans and mamas , just as the one between stay - at - home and working moms , is largely staged			1
the sometimes jazzy headlines -- such as " the conflict attacks progressive parenting as anti-feminist " on april 10 in the @entity61 -- do a disservice to the complex lives of women			2
creating two categories of mothers pits one against the other , and obscures the way traditional mommy - dividing categories often overlap			1
women frequently opt in and out and back from paid work			0
conversations about that fabricated domestic war and the latest international one obscure real differences linked to factors such as class and education			2
and of course , " @entity5 " and " @entity4 " simplify the lives of millions of mothers in both countries			1
if , instead , we actually read these books , we would realize that these authors are trying to offer solutions to the same problems in different ways			0
we admit it 's hardly as sexy as the @entity91 - @entity90 showdown , whereby stay - at - home motherhood became partisan fodder after the @entity95 strategist @entity91 criticized @entity96 for turning to his wife , who has " never worked a day in her life , " for counsel on the economic issues working mothers face			1
but we ought to slow down long enough to hear what these authors say before pulling our guns			0
there are kernels of wisdom here			0
@entity22 , for example , wants all women ( and particularly those who are @entity5 ) to resist ideals of mothering that view women as the primary , more " natural " caregiver , which can make it all the more difficult to balance motherhood with work and a full , adult life			1
we applaud the way she asks us to examine these intensive ideals of motherhood and their reach			0
no woman should feel shame because she fails to breastfeed or give birth without an epidural			0
more fundamentally , we agree that care - giving should n't be the province of women alone			0
we disagree with @entity22 , however , that the obstacles are merely in our heads			0
we think they 're in political structures , too			0
despite @entity22 dismissing as irrelevant the @entity5 policies that make health care and day care accessible and affordable , here in the @entity4 , we lack such support for parents , mothers in particular , who work and do the second shift at home			1
the battle for @entity144 stations and flextime seems a worthier cause than the trumped - up war between those who breastfeed and those who do n't			2
surely natural mothering practices would not be so oppressive and disadvantageous to women if we set up society to accommodate them			0
and while we 're on it , the focus on breasts is a diversion			0
as a mother said in an interview when @entity22 's book came out in @entity5 , the real conflict is not between the mother and the woman , but the woman and the company			1
when @entity22 rejects breastfeeding so mothers can retain their sexuality , one could argue she is merely replacing the tyranny of " breasts for bébé " for the tyranny of " breasts for men			0
" still , @entity22 has good points , and we should n't be so offended as to let the criticism of our parenting overshadow the reality that we , in the @entity4 , have a long way to go			2
perhaps there is something to @entity4 mothers ' nostalgia for the @entity5 way of life , like authors @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity10 , all who have raised children in @entity5			1
you do n't have to be an anthropologist to know that other cultural perspectives can shed light on how we 've constructed particular ideals of motherhood and family , how our government and workplaces value -- or do n't value -- motherhood			0
perhaps the @entity5 experience might be a reminder that , with a revolution , structures can , and do , change			2
the solution to the challenges of @entity4 parenting is hardly as simple as making children eat spinach , or privileging disposable diapers over cloth			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers .			0

writers : the first " mommy war " pitted stay - at - home against working mothers
now , three books extoll the *virtues* of the @entity5 mothering style , they say
these *divisive* conflicts over a mother 's role ignore *extenuating* circumstances , they say
writers say that @entity4 face challenges in child - rearing that are more complex
