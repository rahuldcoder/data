there was some good news this week			2
the @entity4 state attorney general 's office has told four major retailers -- @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 -- to cease sales of their store - branded herbal supplements because their products do not actually contain the herbs purportedly listed on their labels			1
these herbal supplements contain mostly fillers and in some cases potential allergens			1
but other supplements are more worrisome			1
as a nutrition expert , i am horrified by the daily barrage of outrageous and unsubstantiated claims touting cures from everything from @entity27 to @entity28			1
if you do a web search on just about any disease , you will find carefully worded ads promoting unproven nutritional therapies			2
worse , some of these can be harmful			2
for example , people have suffered liver damage from green tea extract that is so severe that they have needed a liver transplant			2
and the frequency of harm from dietary supplements is on the rise			1
dietary supplements are not miracle pills			1
extremely few of the claims are supported by good science , even when the substance on the label is actually in the bottle ( which we 've learned we do n't know for sure ) , and many others have been proven ineffective			1
fortunately , some recent developments are heartening			2
the @entity56 won a settlement against @entity58 , llc and its owner , @entity60 , who shamefully claimed that the company 's dietary supplements , which are mostly fish oil , will treat speech problems in autistic children			1
the @entity56 also won a large settlement against @entity67 and @entity68 , llc. this company is infamous for promoting its green tea product as a weight loss miracle by sending paid spokespeople disguised as objective experts to appear on " the dr. @entity75			2
" the outrageousness of these claims knows no bounds			1
and there are no bounds since the law that regulates the industry , the @entity84 of 1994 , took all control and oversight of these products away from the @entity88			2
powerful politicians , in partnership with the supplement industry , created ad campaigns so effective that more people wrote to @entity94 in support of the bill than wrote about the @entity97			1
as a result , there is little regulation of anything called a dietary supplement			1
it is left mostly to the @entity56 to prosecute companies for fraud for their unsubstantiated claims about supplements			1
these companies are crafty in how they make their claims when the health effect , and safety , of their supplements are unproven			1
but those of us in the health community are at least in part to blame for the confusion that drives the enormous market for alternative medicine			2
first , we contradict ourselves every time we issue a new set of guidelines			0
for example , the @entity122 @entity121 issues new dietary guidelines approximately every five years			0
since the 1980s , there have been the @entity126 , the @entity127 , the @entity128 and @entity129			0
each of these guidelines has substantially changed how we are supposed to think about our diets			0
the @entity121 plans to publish another guideline next year			0
and there are dozens of additional dietary guidelines published every year by professional organizations on everything from preventing cancer to controlling diabetes			0
flooded with all of these different guidelines , consumers may feel overwhelmed and think that health experts do not have all the answers , hence they turn to health fads and supplements			1
second , there are no controls in place , where supplements are concerned , to regulate how we might be biased by conflicts of interest			2
this is illegal when it comes to pharmaceuticals			0
for example , @entity157 claimed to be a nutrition expert despite having no credible education or degree to support it			0
currently , he is being sued by the @entity164 attorney general on allegations of falsely representing himself as a doctor			1
the authors and supporters of nutritional quackery are often quick to claim that there is little potential harm			0
after all , we are talking about nutrients			0
we all need nutrients , so of course they are safe , right ? the magical thinking that nutrients or herbs that we take into our bodies have no potential for harm often goes unchallenged			0
but we have seen time and again that nutritional interventions that sound great can turn out to be harmful			0
for example , in large randomized trials , beta carotene increases the incidence of lung cancer			0
in other studies , vitamin e and selenium significantly increased the incidence of prostate cancer			0
nutritional science is very complex			0
if these substances are effective , they are acting as drugs and should be regulated as such			0
given the clear potential for harm , and even death , from these unregulated supplements , and the lack of ethics in the absence of strong prohibitions , it is time for better laws			1
but meanwhile , let the buyers beware .			0
