-- in a poll published last week by the @entity3 magazine @entity2 , 71 % of adults polled confessed to being very concerned about @entity6 companies abusing their personal information			0
but what this poll failed to ask was whether we fear governmental abuse of our online data as much as abuse from private companies			1
so who do you fear more taking advantage of your online information : private internet companies or the government ? forget @entity20			1
forget the totalitarian @entity21 in " @entity22			0
" for a more prescient glimpse of our electronically networked future , read " surveillance , " @entity28 's chilling 2007 novel about a paranoid society where everybody , particularly the snooping government , has become a voyeur of other people 's lives			1
" we 're all spooks now , " one character tells another			0
" look at the way people @entity37 their prospective dates			0
everybody 's trying to spy on everybody else			0
" yes , in our creepy social media world of @entity45 , @entity37 + and @entity46 , we can all become spooks			0
indeed , as @entity50 founder , @entity48 noted , @entity45 -- with its nearly billion members spewing out massive amounts of personal data -- " is the most appalling spying machine that has been ever invented			0
" but , in today 's radically transparent networked world where even spookery has been democratized , nobody does surveillance quite as effectively as the government			1
and in a contemporaneous political culture shaped by paranoia about crime and terrorism , governmental surveillance may be threatening to undermine our intrinsic individual rights to privacy			1
@entity70 's " surveillance " is permeated by this paranoia			1
" it 's the t - t - t - talk of terrorism that t - terrorizes me , " one character in the novel confesses			0
yes , and it 's this t - t - t - talk of terrorism , i 'm afraid , that is now being used by the paranoid @entity80 government to justify its creation of an electronic surveillance state			1
described by critics as the online " snooping " plan , the @entity80 government is trying to give the @entity87 's monitoring agency , @entity86 ( @entity86 ) , new powers to " in certain circumstances " monitor our @entity89 calls , instant - messages , emails and other online communications			1
the intended legislation requires " communications service providers " ( @entity96 and email providers ) to install " @entity99 " ( @entity99 ) technology hardware which would give @entity86 the ability , without a warrant , to monitor and intercept the times , dates , frequency and addresses ( but not the actual content ) of our online calls , emails and instant - messaging communications			1
so why ? how is the @entity80 government justifying such a flagrant disregard of its citizens ' basic right to privacy by giving @entity86 the right to inspect the details of our private online correspondence ? it 's the t - t - t - talk of terrorism			1
as @entity0 reported last week , the @entity87 argued that these intended laws were vital " in certain circumstances to investigate serious crime and terrorism and to protect the public			2
" and , a " highly placed source " told @entity125 about its fear of losing terrorists on the @entity6 , " we need to take action to maintain the continued availability of communications data to the police and other agencies investigating criminality			2
" it 's not just @entity80 , however , where government surveillance is threatening to undermine our right to private online communications			1
as the @entity141 noted last week , @entity86 is run " in close collaboration with the @entity143 ( @entity143 ) in the @entity3 "			0
and as @entity125 notes , both the @entity143 and the @entity145 are already using @entity99 technology -- in the name , of course , of the war against terrorism - to monitor internet traffic in the @entity3			2
worse still , a privacy group called @entity153 has identified @entity80 , @entity3 , @entity154 and @entity156 companies who are exporting spooky technologies like @entity99 hardware and equally sophisticated software products like " optical cyber solutions " that enable mass surveillance of large scale populations , to repressive regimes in the @entity166 such as @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170			1
as @entity171 , the editor of @entity172 , asks , " how can @entity174 democracies back the fight for freedom in the @entity166 while @entity174 companies supply surveillance equipment to authoritarian governments in the same region ? " the use of surveillance technology by authoritarian regimes is n't , of course , only limited to the @entity166			1
in @entity187 , for example , dissidents like the artist @entity188 are under constant state surveillance 24 hours a day			2
indeed , last week , the @entity187 authorities shut down a website , @entity192 , through which @entity188 was streaming live video of his own home via four webcams as a satirical statement against the surveillance regime in @entity198			2
" byebye to all voyeurs , " @entity188 tweeted after his self - surveillance cameras were switched off			2
if only we could really bid adieu to all voyeurs			0
but the truth is that digital technologies such as @entity99 are enabling governments -- in the name of investigating criminals or terrorists -- to snoop more and more intimately upon us			2
and this is only going to get worse as we invent more and more invasive technologies that capture our most personal data			0
take , for example , @entity37 's augmented reality glasses which , with their ability to follow us everywhere we go , the @entity220 columnist @entity218 suggests , could " make a persistent , pervasive surveillance state inevitable			2
" i 'm not so sure about the inevitability of this surveillance state			0
but just as we need laws to protect us from @entity6 companies that seek to abuse our personal data , so we also need protection from today 's snooping state			0
the @entity230 commissioner of @entity231 , @entity228 is pressing for the @entity232 to establish " right to be forgotten " legislation that would establish strict rules for how private companies use our data			1
" worries about online privacy are one of the most frequent reasons for why people do n't buy goods and services on the @entity244 , " @entity228 wrote in february			0
" our confidence in a digital future will depend on whether we know that our data will be safely protected			0
" yes , @entity228 is correct			0
there is definitely a need to regulate private companies like @entity45 and @entity37 whose appetite for our most intimate data appears insatiable			0
but as we begin to worry about the snooping state , perhaps we need to consider the idea of broader " right to be forgotten " legislation directed against intelligence services like @entity86 or @entity143 , that would protect our private data in a digitally networked age where everyone , especially the government , is becoming a spook			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity265 .			1

the @entity80 government has suggested new powers for monitoring of digital communications " in certain circumstances . "
@entity265 : such surveillance is threatening to undermine citizens ' rights to private online communications .
the use of surveillance technology now extends beyond authoritarian regimes , says @entity265 .
@entity265 backs digital " right to be forgotten " legislation proposed by some legislators
