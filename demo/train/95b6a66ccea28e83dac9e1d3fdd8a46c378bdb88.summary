@entity0 -- was the sound of @entity3 striking the water captured by ocean devices used to listen for signs of nuclear blasts ? it 's a long shot , but an @entity10 university is studying records from underwater listening devices in an effort to help find the missing plane			1
" one signal has been detected on several receivers that could be related to the crash , " said @entity15 of @entity17 's @entity16 ( @entity16 )			1
researchers are studying a very low frequency sound to see if it was " the impact of the aircraft on the water or the implosion of parts of the aircraft as it sank , " @entity15 said			1
" but ( the source of the noise ) is just as likely to be a natural event , " he said			0
low frequency signals can travel thousands of kilometers through water under favorable circumstances , @entity15 said			2
but " at the moment ( the sound ) appears to be inconsistent with other data about the aircraft position , " he said			2
@entity39 , the chief commissioner with the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) , the organization leading the search into @entity3 at the request of @entity44 , agreed with @entity46 analysis of the sound			2
" we think that those detections may have been interesting from the point of view of the direction they came , but other characteristics make it unlikely that they are associated with @entity3 , " he said			0
the @entity40 first referenced these signals in a document posted on its website on monday			0
the research is continuing , @entity15 said , and investigators may release additional information about their findings in the coming days			0
as was the case with the @entity64 satellite -- a communications satellite whose data was analyzed by @entity3 investigators as a navigational aide -- this study involves the use of technology for a purpose that it was not originally intended for			0
one of the devices , operated by @entity17 and located some 20 kilometers off @entity75 , is designed to listen to whales and other marine life			0
the other is for signs of underwater nuclear explosions , one of 11 operated worldwide by the @entity83 - chartered @entity82 ( @entity82 ) as part of the @entity85			1
search area ' can now be discounted ' gleaning the data early in the search for @entity3 , the @entity83 reported it had not detected any explosions or plane crashes on land or water from its sensors around the globe			1
but the recent efforts involve pairing @entity82 data with other sources to see what can be gleaned , officials said			0
" one can always be hopeful , " said @entity101 , a seismic acoustic analyst with the @entity82			1
the @entity82 's hydro - acoustic stations detect low frequency sound in the 0 - 100 hz range , and ca n't detect black box " pings " in the 30 - 40 khz range , officials said			1
" it 's possible ( to detect a plane crash ) , but the circumstances that would allow it would have to be very particular , " said @entity109			1
prior said some of those circumstances might include a sloping sea bed			0
another possible scenario : the origin of the sound would need to be near the listening device			0
the @entity82 's system near @entity122 , the southwestern-most point of @entity10 , regularly captures signals of ice breaking noise from @entity126 and seismic activity from @entity128 , he said			1
" there are other scenarios that would allow ( the hydrophones to detect a crash )			2
but it 's not certain if there was an impact we would detect it , " @entity109 said			1
attempts were made following the 2009 crash of @entity139 447 in the southern @entity140 to see if underwater listening devices had detected the plane 's impact			1
no data could be found			0
years later , after the plane was located , @entity82 again checked its data , and still was not able to identify signals related to the crash			2
on friday , @entity151 put pressure on @entity44 to start a new search , @entity150 state news agency @entity149 reported			0
" we expect @entity44 to take the leading and coordinating role , come up with a new search plan for the jet at an early date , and take the investigation seriously , " premier @entity154 told @entity44 prime minister @entity155 , who was on a diplomatic visit			2
the largest contingency of passengers on board @entity3 were from @entity150 .			0

an @entity10 university is studying underwater listening devices to help find the jet
early in the search , the @entity83 said it had not detected any explosions or crashes from its sensors
" it 's not certain if there was an impact we would detect it , " says seismic acoustic analyst
an *re-examination* of data relating to @entity185 could not detect crash signals from under water
