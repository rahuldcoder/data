-- a pro-palestinian college professor 's tenure offer at the @entity3 was allegedly rescinded after he made anti-israel tweets about the war in @entity6			1
dr. @entity11 's case " is sort of unprecedented in a way , " said @entity7 , the legal director for the @entity8			1
the organization 's legal team has advised @entity11 as they consider potential legal avenues			1
in october 2013 , the university offered @entity11 a tenured position in the @entity17 , which @entity11 accepted , according to @entity7			1
but on august 1 , 2014 , @entity11 received a letter from chancellor dr. @entity19 terminating the appointment			1
by then , @entity7 said , @entity11 had resigned from his tenured position at @entity22 , rented his home in @entity24 and was preparing to move his family to @entity26			1
@entity28 chair @entity27 confirmed @entity11 had resigned and would not be returning in the fall			2
according to @entity3 protocol , once an offer is made , the chancellor 's office must make a recommendation to the board of trustees for final authorization			1
@entity7 said @entity37 rescinded the offer before it went to the board			2
@entity7 said he believes the reason was @entity11 's " political expressions " in social media			1
@entity44 's @entity43 feed includes messages like " # @entity47 's message to # @entity48 and # @entity49 : we 'll kill as many @entity50 as we want , when we want			0
: f --- you , pay me			0
# @entity6 " another post reads , " only # @entity47 can murder around 300 children in the span of a few weeks and insist that it is the victim			2
# @entity6 # @entity57 " @entity3 spokeswoman @entity58 said , " as a matter of university policy and practice , we do not comment publicly upon nor discuss generally any personnel matters , including matters involving employment or tenure			1
" in an open letter sent to @entity37 , @entity7 cites " viewpoint discrimination " as the reason for the dismissal , calling it a " serious @entity70 violation			0
" " he resigned from a job that gave him tenure , the pinnacle of academic achievement , with the expectation that he would have tenure at the next university and it was taken away in an unlawfully retaliatory way for his political views , " @entity7 said			0
@entity0 was not able to reach @entity44 but spoke to his wife , who declined to comment other than to confirm her husband had been consulting with @entity7			0
@entity0 also was unable to reach @entity37 for comment			0
@entity90 did not clarify why last month she defended @entity11 's right to tweet his views during an interview with @entity95 , a local newspaper			1
she said then , " @entity96 have a wide range of scholarly and political views , and we recognize the freedom of speech rights of all of our employees			0
" @entity11 's controversial views were no secret at the time the university made him an offer			1
he is the author of six books , including " @entity47 's @entity107 " and the " @entity108 in the @entity109			0
" @entity11 's opinions , @entity7 said , constitute the basis for his scholarly research , which was the reason he was offered the position to begin with			1
@entity11 believed the principles of academic freedom " would permit him to share his views without fear of censure or reprisal , " said @entity7			2
@entity37 's move to block the appointment has drawn criticism and support			2
@entity123 , a longtime @entity124 professor at the university and a past president of the @entity127 , supported @entity37			0
he said , " i believe the decision not to offer him a job was the right one			2
" " i find many of his tweets quite loathsome â € ” as well as sophomoric and irresponsible , " he said , adding that " while universities need to study all positions on an issue , even the most outrageous ones , i see no good reason to offer a permanent faculty position to someone whose discourse crosses the line into anti-semitism			2
" @entity123 has written on the topic of academic freedom in the past			0
in an essay posted on his website , he said academic freedom " is the principle that guarantees faculty members the right to speak and write as they please without interference from the university , the state , or the public			0
" the @entity158 on @entity159 and @entity160 released a statement supporting @entity11			2
" professor @entity11 's words while strident and vulgar were an impassioned plea to end the violence currently taking place in the @entity167 , " the statement read			1
" the @entity3 can not cancel an appointment based upon @entity43 statements that are protected speech in the @entity109			0
" a @entity172 petition created by an @entity109 professor of @entity175 descent in support of @entity11 had garnered over 11,000 signatures			1
@entity7 said he had not received a response from @entity37			0
meanwhile @entity11 's professional future remained in limbo			1
" i do n't think he knows what he is going to do , " @entity7 said			0
" he is a scholar and scholars should be in university setting			0
" celebs step into @entity47 - @entity6 pr minefield @entity187 ' stands behind ' @entity6 quotes : ' @entity188 '			0

dr. @entity11 quits job , rents house for move to @entity26
but professor 's job offer at @entity3 is rescinded
