@entity0 , @entity1 -- like cholera itself , @entity1 's protests against the @entity4 spread thursday to the capital , @entity0 , as angry people took to the streets demanding the global body get out of their country			1
similar demonstrations erupted earlier this week in the northern coastal city of @entity14 after assertions that @entity4 peacekeepers from @entity17 were responsible for starting the cholera outbreak that has claimed more than 1,100 lives and spread to eight of the nation 's 10 departments			1
the @entity4 has denied that its forces were responsible for the outbreak			1

several threw rocks at a campaign poster for presidential candidate @entity43 , whose candidacy has been endorsed by outgoing president @entity45			2
others threw @entity48 cocktails at the poster			2
some @entity1 have said @entity43 is a symbol of what is not working in the country , and that @entity45 's endorsement of him means the election -- set for november 28 -- will not be fair			2
near the presidential palace , which was destroyed in the january 12 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people and left more than 1 million homeless , stores were closed and few cars were in the streets , though pedestrians were moving about freely			2

" the @entity1 government is never do nothing for us , " said @entity68 , a protester who lives in the camp			2
" and we know the international government is still spending a lot of money for the @entity1 people			0
but @entity45 , with his government , he still keeps their money to take back to the @entity79 to buy some house			0

the @entity79 government strategy for aid in @entity1 is to focus on prevention , he said , citing the need for clean drinking water , the addition of chlorine to the water supply , the ready availability of oral rehydration salts , education of the populace about how to protect themselves from getting the disease , and money to expand treatment centers			1
" we 're going to invest a lot of money in their health system in the next five years , " said @entity133 , special coordinator for @entity1			0
" every hour that the efforts of medical and relief workers are obstructed means more deaths of @entity1 from cholera , " said dr. @entity138 , director of the @entity139 ( @entity139 )			2
" we understand the frustration of many @entity1 with the tragic situation that has developed as a result of systemic poverty , the january earthquake and now the cholera epidemic			2

" the last shipment of medical supplies was delivered over the weekend , and we had to postpone distribution planned for monday , " said @entity172			0
" the airport was closed , and many roads remain blocked			0
we have not been able to ship new supplies to the area at all this week			0
" beginning monday , residents of @entity14 , which has been hard hit by the outbreak , began demonstrations against @entity4 peacekeepers			1
the northern port city is in the @entity186 , the @entity1 province that has the highest fatality rate from cholera , 7.5 percent			1
