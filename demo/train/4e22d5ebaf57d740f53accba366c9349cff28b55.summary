@entity0 -- president @entity2 on wednesday signed a law that makes it a federal crime to assault an individual because of his or her sexual orientation or gender identity			1
the expanded federal hate crimes law , hailed by supporters as the first major federal gay rights legislation , was added to a $ 680 billion defense authorization bill that @entity2 signed at a packed @entity14 ceremony			1
the hate crimes measure was named for @entity16 , a gay @entity18 teenager who died after being kidnapped and severely beaten in october 1998 , and @entity19 , an @entity20 man dragged to death in @entity22 the same year			1
@entity16 's mother , @entity23 , was among those at the ceremony that also included vice president @entity25 , defense secretary @entity26 , attorney general @entity27 and leading members of @entity29 and the @entity30 , who were on hand for the appropriations bill signing			1
to loud applause , @entity2 hailed the hate crimes measure in the bill as a step toward change to " help protect our citizens from violence based on what they look like , who they love , how they pray			1
" he cited the work of the late sen. @entity46 of @entity47 and others " to make this day possible			0
" later wednesday , @entity2 stood with @entity16 's parents and relatives of @entity19 at a separate @entity14 event honoring passage of the expanded hate crimes law			1
noting reports of 12,000 crimes based on sexual orientation over the past 10 years , @entity2 called the bill another step in the continuing struggle for protecting human rights			1
" because of the efforts of the folks in this room , particularly those family members standing behind me , the bell rings even louder now , " @entity2 said			0
when he finished his remarks , he hugged the weeping relatives as the audience applauded			0
several religious groups have expressed concern that a hate crimes law could be used to criminalize conservative speech relating to subjects such as abortion or homosexuality			2
however , @entity27 has said that any federal hate - crimes law would be used only to prosecute violent acts based on bias , not to prosecute speech based on controversial racial or religious beliefs			1
former president @entity82 had threatened to veto a similar measure , but @entity2 brought a reversal of that policy to the @entity14			1
when the bill won final congressional approval last week , @entity87 president @entity86 called the hate crimes measure " our nation 's first major piece of civil rights legislation for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people			1
" earlier this month , @entity2 told the @entity87 , the country 's largest gay rights group , that the nation still needs to make significant changes to ensure equal rights for gays and lesbians			2
" despite the progress we 've made , there are still laws to change and hearts to open , " he said in an address at the group 's annual dinner			0
" this fight continues now and i 'm here with the simple message : i 'm here with you in that fight			0
" among other things , @entity2 has called for the repeal of the ban on gays serving openly in the military -- the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy			0
he also has urged @entity29 to repeal the @entity121 and pass the @entity122			0
the @entity121 defines marriage , for federal purposes , as a legal union between a man and a woman			0
it allows states to refuse to recognize same - sex marriages			2
the @entity122 and @entity130 would extend family benefits now available to heterosexual federal employees to gay and lesbian federal workers			2
however , some advocates for stronger rights for the lesbian - gay - bisexual - transgender community have complained that @entity2 's administration is moving too slowly on his legislative promises			1
opponents of the expanded hate crimes bill challenged the need to specify one particular community in federal legislation			2
they contended that existing federal hate crimes laws were sufficient to protect the rights of people based on sexual orientation and gender identity			0
more than 77,000 hate - crime incidents were reported by the @entity151 between 1998 and 2007 , or " nearly one hate crime for every hour of every day over the span of a decade , " @entity27 told the @entity154 in june			1
at wednesday 's signing , @entity2 also praised what he called a bipartisan effort to start changing the culture of military spending through the annual appropriations bill			2
he noted that @entity26 had worked with congressional leaders to end what @entity2 called wasteful projects like the f - 22 fighter bomber and a new presidential helicopter that would have cost " almost as much as @entity167			0
" " i wo n't be flying on that , " the president said			0
noting that cost overruns in military projects total tens of billions of dollars , @entity2 called for further " fundamental " reforms in how the government and @entity30 do business			0
" we all know where this kind of waste comes from , " he said , citing " indefensible " no - bid contracts and special interests pushing unneeded weapons systems			0
such actions are " inexcusable " , " unconscionable " and an " affront to the @entity20 people " as the nation faces two wars and an economic recession , @entity2 said			1
" today i 'm pleased to say that we have proved that change is possible , " he said .			0
