-- the changing black and white mri images resembled a @entity3 test			2
somewhere in these patterns was the story of my pain			2
i knew there was something wrong with my shoulders because it felt as if my arms were attached by rusty nails			2
looking at the scans , the surgeon made it clear : i needed surgery in both shoulders			1
i could n't accept this reality			2
these surgeries are n't just a giant setback for my career as an acrobat , they could pose a threat to my sobriety			1
i am a recovering heroin addict who can not take opiate painkillers			1
i have witnessed many recovering addicts relapse after surgery			1
i 've traveled this path myself after a few terrible root canals from another medical experience , and came crawling back to heroin			1
i 've learned not to take any risks			2
how can i wager my recovery on the scales of justice ? on one side sits surgery with the possibility of relapse			1
on the other sits an injured body in pain			2
how could i bargain the one element that has given me a beautiful and free life ? addict goes under the knife my first fear revolves around the actual pain itself			1
narcotic painkillers are the number one prescribed medication after surgery because painkillers kill pain			1
during my active addiction , i lived many years with the ability to eradicate pain at my own whim by simply pushing the end of a syringe			1
now , in recovery , i must bow down and surrender to it			1
is there a difference between eradicating pain and pain management ? do all opiate addicts have to suffer through physical painful situations ? i 've played this scenario out many times			2
i am prescribed narcotic painkillers after surgery , while holding on to the absolute perspective that no matter what , after six years of sobriety , i will not return to the madness of addiction			1
depending on strength and dosage , i 'm instructed to take one to two pills every four to six hours			0
it takes about 20 minutes to feel the effects of the first pill			0
can 20 minutes destroy a lifetime achievement ? as the pill dissolves , the thought slowly waltzes in , as it did in my past			0
to the outsider , i would appear fine , maybe a little drowsy			0
but the imperceptible secret would live behind the thick fog of my thoughts			0
nobody can see the addiction 's contemplation : " this feels good			1
... oh @entity98 , i remember this			0
" as the disease melodically whispers -- as if six years of sobriety never passed -- i cling to the memories of my lifelong struggle with heroin and remember i 've got to stay sober at all costs ! the secret grows , traveling back to memories of my most powerful highs , wrapping its venomous arms into my mundane reality			1
" @entity113 , you are in pain			0
it 's too much pain			1
maybe you should take two pills ( as prescribed ) , " it says			0
two pills seems reasonable , but four to six hours is just too long because the pain seems to be returning quicker			0
maybe an extra pill would n't hurt , i think , eventually cutting back the indicated time by an hour			0
in the final stage of my imagined scenario , the addiction begins to caress my insecurities			0
perfectionism is my great destructor			0
i 'm terrified of making mistakes or being imperfect because i do n't want to be judged or laughed at ( like so many of us )			0
drugs quiet this enormous desire to be perfect			0
the power of these opiates temporarily relieves these stresses , and i find solace in the darkness once again			0
now that the secret is alive and thriving , i go straight to heroin , as the most effective and seductive drug i 've ever known			1
surgery and sobriety is a controversial topic , even among those in recovery			1
it 's such a gray area because nobody really knows how to treat such a delicate situation			1
i think it would be helpful to combine @entity151 and @entity152 medicines , to find some concrete solutions to pain management			0
medication in combination with techniques such as acupuncture or frequency specific aricular therapy			1
it 's not only the recovering addict who is at risk , but others who can end up addicted to narcotic pain medication			1
many years ago , i was in rehab with another patient who was also being treated for opiate addiction			2
he had cancer and was in a lot of physical pain			0
one night he was crying , not because of the pain , but because the doctor had prescribed him @entity175			0
i could n't understand why he was upset			0
we were addicts : a constant flow of opiates is winning the devil 's lottery			2
what more could anyone ask for ? in recovery , i understand his suffering			2
his situation is terrible because , like myself , he can not stop once he begins			0
he is faced with the endless temptation of his addiction because his medication resembles his drug of choice , forever keeping his addiction alive			0
if i am my own worst enemy , and my thoughts are the only voice i hear , what options do i have ? the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity198 .			1
