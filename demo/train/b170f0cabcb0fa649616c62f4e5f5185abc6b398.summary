-- tv commentator and @entity3 favorite @entity2 defeated @entity5 rep. @entity4 in @entity9 's @entity8 @entity7 primary tuesday			1
@entity2 won more than 53 percent of the vote in the bitter campaign that displayed internal @entity8 warfare			1
@entity2 on tuesday night thanked her supporters , including @entity3 groups , saying they " rallied everyday @entity5 outside of the political establishment , [ got ] them involved and created a grassroots network that made all of this possible			1
" " do n't ever underestimate the power of we , the people , " @entity2 said to raucous cheers from her supporters			2
" we , the people , will have our voice heard in @entity24 , once again			0
" @entity4 , a former @entity9 governor who has served nine terms in the @entity26 , thanked supporters in a concession speech tuesday night			2
" the last several weeks have been spirited , shall we say , and the voters of the @entity8 primary have spoken , and i respect that decision , " @entity4 said			1
in the closing days of the primary campaign , @entity2 got a boost with an endorsement by former @entity36 gov. @entity35 and more than $ 150,000 in late contributions from the @entity38			1
the @entity8 establishment is concerned @entity2 has no chance of winning the seat -- once held by @entity42 for 26 years before he became vice president -- in november			1
a top @entity8 official warned tuesday night that national @entity8 will be slow to rally around @entity2			1
" until she demonstrates some viability in the polls , we are not going to have any money for her , " the official told @entity0			0
" it is now incumbent on @entity35 , [ @entity5 sen. ] @entity53 [ of @entity54 ] and the @entity38 to help support her			0
" @entity2 told @entity0 's @entity57 on tuesday night that she 'd " love [ establishment @entity59 ' ] support , but they 're the same so - called experts who said i could n't win the primary			1
" " if we just had that throw - in - the towel mentality every time there was a fight that needed to be fought , our country would n't be what it is , " @entity2 said			2
" there 's a lot of visionaries and leaders ... in this room who believe we can win , and if [ establishment @entity8 are ] too lazy to put in the effort that we need to win , then so be it			1
we 're going to win without them			0
i 'd love their support , but we 're going to win without them			2
" @entity2 positioned herself as a conservative gate - crasher			2
" we 're breaking up the backroom deals , " she told @entity0 before tuesday 's primary			2
" we 're restoring the political process back to the hands of the people			0
" she refers to @entity4 as the " anointed one			0
" in an interview before the primary , @entity2 told @entity0 : -- the @entity8 is behind " false accusations and attack ads " against her and accused party operatives of " fighting for not only my opponent 's political career but their own political career			1
" -- she believes it 's " a shame " that @entity105 , the @entity106 group that backs @entity3 candidates , declined to endorse her but disagrees with the organization 's view that she ca n't win the general election , saying , " no one even thought we could get this far			1
" -- @entity35 's endorsement " is helping a lot " because " it gave my supporters an extra boost of encouragement			0
" and it helped her , too : " gov. @entity35 can relate to the politics of personal destruction , and she 's survived them and they did n't get her down			0
" -- and she says she 'd love support from one well - known @entity120 : " i would love @entity122 's endorsement			0
when i saw her presidential ads , i said , ' you go , girl ! ' i 'm a @entity8 , so i probably wo n't vote for her , but i do admire her			0
" democrats were positively gleeful at the prospect of an @entity2 victory on tuesday			0
many had written off vice president @entity42 's old @entity7 seat as a loss			1
but with @entity2 the projected winner , @entity126 believe they can hold the seat in november , which could save their majority in the @entity7			1
the big unknown heading into tuesday was voter turnout			0
there are fewer than 183,000 registered republicans in the state			0
it 's a closed primary -- meaning neither @entity126 ( about 293,000 registered voters ) nor independents ( 146,000 registered as " other " ) can vote			1
and in an off - year primary , few voters tend to turn out			0
so this race -- and perhaps the balance of power in the @entity7 -- was decided by fewer people than usually turn out for a @entity35 rally			2
@entity0 's @entity149 contributed to this report			0
