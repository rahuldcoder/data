@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the 6 - 1/2 years @entity4 spent in @entity6 prisons between 1998 and 2004 , he produced an estimated 250 paintings			1
he credits prison guards with helping to save most of his work			2
@entity4 stands beside " @entity11 , " which alludes to last year 's @entity6 protests and @entity13			2
they became his audience during his time in prison			2
in what @entity4 called " the smuggling painting project , " he said eight to 10 guards provided him with house paint , acrylics , or colored powder from the prison factory where inmates made items			1
they were too scared to provide a brush , however ; so , @entity4 improvised by resorting to his fingers , hands , soap , sometimes his face			2
his canvases were his dinner plate and white cotton prison uniforms			0
it was while working on the cotton uniforms , the absorbency of which made controlling lines difficult , that @entity4 discovered monoprinting as a useful technique			2
he would take his dinner plate , apply glue and color to its backside , use his finger as a brush , and then press the finished image against the cotton			0
@entity4 would show the prison guards his paintings , explain their meaning and solicit their opinions : " how do you feel ? " he 'd ask			1
" one year later , they appreciate my art , " he said			0
the more paints they brought , the more he painted , and this was how he was able to prove he was an artist , not a politician , @entity4 said			1
eventually , the guards would want to share the secret with their friends , other guards			0
and this is how the " network " grew , @entity4 said			2
these men took a big risk , facing demotion or possible imprisonment themselves , but their jobs were for a living , not for any particular belief , @entity4 explained			2
moreover , there was some relish for the secrecy of " the game			0
" today , most of those cloth paintings are housed in @entity77 , @entity78 , at the @entity79 , a repository for documents concerning the @entity6 opposition movements			1
in the past year , @entity4 , now 41 , has rendered those same images onto canvas , a dozen of which have been the focus of an exhibition at the @entity89 in @entity0 , @entity1			1
his work next heads to exhibition at the @entity93 in @entity94 , @entity95 , from mid-may to early july			0
his " @entity97 " series shows the use of plate bottoms , his hands and blocks -- the same tools he used while in prison			0
in " @entity105 , " a single white line is used to trace the body of the prisoner as well as the walls of his prison , while smaller blocks of prisoners surround it			0
further inscribed is a window with bars			0
the original cloth " prison paintings " are not for sale , however			1
@entity4 was imprisoned for a month in @entity117 , two years at @entity118 , and 4 - 1/2 years at @entity119 in the south			2
he was sentenced after being charged on the basis of a letter by a " former comrade " listing him as a potential recruit for @entity6 opposition events in 1998 , the 10 - year anniversary of landmark democracy protests , according to @entity4			1
although he was involved in the 1988 democracy protests as a young law student , his arrest occurred when he was not involved in politics , he said in a follow - up e-mail			0
" i was making a living as an artist and an actor			0
" " you are very nice			0
why are you in prison ? " he recalled the prisoner guards as asking			2
they tended to be uneducated and had little knowledge of politics much less art , @entity4 said			1
some prison guards would ask , " could you write a very lovely poem to my girlfriend ? " or " can you do a design for my tattoo ? " @entity4 said			1
" so i draw for them			0
" @entity4 , who performed in the streets in @entity117 before his arrest , would also keep an eye out for prisoners about to be released ; he wanted their prison uniforms			1
many uniforms were used for portraits of other political prisoners , of @entity157 , and of @entity4 's father , who died while the son was still in prison			1
eventually , @entity4 had to get rid of the paintings he was accumulating to avoid attracting attention from the prison superiors			1
the most he had in his cell were 10			0
as he befriended his guards , beseeching them to safeguard his paintings until his release , they would haul away the works in bags that carried prisoners ' scraps for the pets at home , @entity4 said			1
the cloth would be folded so as not to be dirtied			0
in one instance , however , a sergeant who 'd agreed to smuggle paintings out of prison got very confused while looking at them and thought they included a map of a prison , @entity4 said			1
" he destroyed 20 of my paintings			1
" in 2005 , a year after @entity4 's release from @entity119 , one guard came to @entity4 's solo exhibition in @entity117 featuring the cotton paintings he did during his prison years			1
the guard felt pride , @entity4 said			1
the exhibition was called " 00235 , " the prisoner number @entity4 was assigned by the @entity195 during its visits			1
just weeks ago , @entity4 painted " @entity197 , " which unites the history of the 1988 pro-democracy movement and the pro-democracy protests in august and september of last year			2
rimming three borders of the paintings are feathers of the " fighting peacock , " the longtime symbol for @entity6 students later adopted for the flag of the @entity208 , the party of @entity157			0
the painting took him a couple days			0
gallery owner @entity210 said she offered him a solo exhibition right after hearing him give a talk last year			0
" clearly , his art is formed by his prison experience			2
but what i like about him is his realization that he needs to move away from this ... in order to develop as an artist , " she said			0
since moving to @entity220 , where he lives with his wife , former @entity222 ambassador to @entity6 @entity223 , he 's painted a series of three " how do you find @entity220 " paintings in response to questions about his new city			0
the series " how do you find @entity231 " was painted for the @entity232 in which he participated last year			0
other cities he 's traveled to and roads he 's traveled on since he left @entity6 have been rendered in paint , an activity he enjoys while his wife is driving , @entity4 said .			1

eight to 10 guards provided paints to @entity4 , smuggled his paintings out of prison
@entity4 said he was able to use art to demonstrate he is an artist , not a politician
original cloth paintings not for sale ; were rendered onto canvas now on exhibition
one guard destroyed 20 paintings , thinking one showed a prison map , @entity4 said
