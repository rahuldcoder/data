-- @entity1 may be known for its earthquakes , but so far this year it has been surpassed by an unlikely state : @entity4			1
experts say wastewater wells are likely linked to the big increase in the number of quakes recorded in @entity4			1
between 1978 and 2008 , @entity4 experienced an average of just two quakes of 3.0 magnitude of greater			2
in 2014 , as of thursday , there have been about 207 such quakes recorded in the state , according to the @entity17			0
the upward trend started in 2009 , with 20 quakes of 3.0 magnitude or greater , then 43 the following year , and jumping every year with the exception of 2012			2
@entity4 has now surpassed @entity1 in quakes , and seismologists see no end in sight , @entity0 meteorologist @entity22 said			1
@entity1 has recorded about 140 3.0 - magnitude quakes or greater , compared to 207 in @entity4			1
the oil and gas industry 's injection of wastewater deep into the @entity31 apparently is linked to the shift in seismic activity in @entity4 , @entity22 said			1
the fracturing fluid seems to be lubricating existing faults that have not moved in recent years , he said			0
the fracturing process is not creating new faults , but are exposing faults that already exist , he said			0
on wednesday , at least seven earthquakes were recorded in @entity4 , according to the @entity17			2
there were no reports of significant damage , but that does n't mean that these quakes are not of concern to scientists			0
" the fact that the number of earthquakes in @entity4 is even comparable to @entity1 is unusual , " @entity17 geophysicist @entity47 said			1
" we 've seen swarms of earthquakes over the interior of the @entity55 , but this is on a completely different scale , for the area where all the earthquakes are occurring is bigger than any previous swarm , " he added			0
" it 's not really a swarm , it 's really a collection of swarms			0
" it can not be ruled out that the spike in earthquakes is a once - every - 10,000 - years thing , but scientists do n't know and a surprised by the numbers			0
" given the rate of earthquakes over the last six months , it 's concerning enough to be worried about a larger , damaging earthquake happening , let alone what might happen in the future , " @entity47 said			0
many of these quakes are being linked to wastewater injection , he said			2
some earthquakes have been linked to hydraulic fracturing , or fracking , but for the most part , the @entity4 earthquakes are linked to wastewater wells , @entity47 said			1
geophysicists have not been able to gather data to pin down the certain set of wastewater wells that are causing the earthquake problem , but they 're hopeful to learn more about the problematic wells in the future			1
research into the links between the wastewater wells and quakes started about four years ago , @entity47 said			1
to better gauge the increased quakes , @entity17 and @entity4 officials have added monitoring stations , which now stand at 15 permanent facilities and 17 temporary stations			2
the @entity102 last month urged a wait - and - see approach in judging the @entity17 's assertions on links between wastewater disposal and earthquakes			0
" because crude oil and natural gas is produced in 70 of @entity4 's 77 counties , any seismic activity within the state is likely to occur near oil and natural gas activity			0
the @entity102 and the oil and gas industry as a whole support the continued study of @entity4 's increased seismic activity , but a rush to judgment provides no clear understanding of the causes , " the industry group said			0
measuring the magnitude of earthquakes what to know about earthquakes the place where two earthquakes hit every hour feds : energy mining 's disposal wells may have role in @entity4 's earthquakes @entity0 's @entity135 and @entity136 contributed to this report .			1

so far this year , there have been more quakes in @entity4 than @entity1
experts : wastewater wells appear linked to many quakes
scientists worried about a major earthquakes
