@entity0 , @entity1 -- web sites come and go , but the short bursts of text you publish on one web site in particular -- @entity8 -- may end up having a longer shelf life than the company itself			1
the @entity11 announced this week that it will archive the billions of tweets published since @entity8 launched in march 2006			1
yes , that @entity8 , the social networking site mocked and trash - talked in the press , late - night talk shows and by retro - minded pundits as 21st - century navel gazing for fidgeting geeks ( @entity20 : " you know what it reminds me of ? oh yeah , a waste of time			1
" ) but that 's not the way the library sees it : if you use @entity8 and your status updates are public , they should be in the archive			1
@entity8 haters can go on scoffing that tweets are only ephemeral bits of frivolous information , but the @entity11 has just ratified the importance of social media in recording history			1
what else does this mean ? only that future generations will have an unprecedented amount of firsthand data ( in 140 - character bites ) about what people from every corner of the world were doing , thinking and feeling at every moment starting four years ago			2
there will be a record , for example , of the torrent of tweets that brought news from street demonstrations during the @entity58 elections last year , when @entity59 and mobile lines were cut off			0
there will be a record of the devastation and the relief efforts out of @entity65 and @entity66 after the earthquakes ; and of a certain historic presidential inauguration			0
( http://twitter.com/barackobama/status/992176676 " we just made history			0
all of this happened because you gave your time , talent and passion			0
all of this happened because of you			0
thanks " ) more on the @entity11 plan to archive tweets thoughts and ideas written by people who would n't necessarily be in a position to write them into books ( some for good reason ) will be immortalized just the same			1
current and future academics , historians and anthropologists will have a simple but deep dataset to analyze in new ways they have n't thought of yet			1
the @entity11 is the nation 's oldest federal cultural institution			1
its mission is to " sustain and preserve a universal collection of knowledge and creativity for future generations			0
" it does n't sound like the right place to archive messages thumbed on a cell phone or dashed off in the web page text box of a web site			1
or as one of my own twitter followers put it : " since when does banality & frivolity warrant cultural preservation ? " - @ matty_g http://twitter.com/matty_g/status/12187504242 but amidst the " craving a chocolate bar " or " watching my cat throw up a hairball " tweets , there is a serious reflection of historical context -- a real - time timeline written by regular people			0
even a small sampling of archived tweets yields insights			0
" breaking : @entity125 just passed ! ! ! ! this is one small step for health care , one giant leap for @entity129 ! " @entity130 another , when @entity131 won the @entity133 gold : " oh my @entity134 ! @entity131 was amazing in the half pipe ! landing the double mctwist / big mac / white snake / giant tomato ! sweet ! " @entity138 and this week the @entity139 ( @ whitehouse on @entity8 ) solicited ideas from citizens about what the @entity129 ' next major technological or scientific achievement should be			2
the archive of tweeted replies is intended to help prioritize the president 's to - do list			2
finally , three things about @entity8 's dataset particularly suit it for the library 's archive : 1			1
a tweet is small and has a simple structure			0
billions of public tweets are already available , and millions of new tweets go into the system every day			0
while @entity8 itself and certain partners maintain copies of the data created with the service , the library will preserve that data regardless of what becomes of those businesses			2
perhaps the most amazing thing is that the tweet archive gives many more people entrée into a collection historically reserved for a select few			1
getting your words and ideas included in such an important cultural archive is a privilege			0
@entity8 users may cringe at the thought that their tweet about the cat getting sick will outlive them like this , but they should celebrate , then make their next tweet really good			2
it will be around for awhile			0
or as a twitter follower put it : « @entity11 archiving tweets should remind us all that once it is in the ether , it 's forever			1
» - @ itwalkabout http://twitter.com/itwalkabout/status/12187791303 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			2

@entity11 will archive all @entity8 messages since site started in 2006
the move , @entity192 says , *validates* social media 's role in recording history
archive gives academics , historians , anthropologists a simple , deep dataset , she says
@entity192 : many more people will have entrée into a collection usually reserved for select few
