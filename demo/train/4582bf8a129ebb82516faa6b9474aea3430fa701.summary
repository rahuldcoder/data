-- three years ago , a federal court found the @entity2 responsible for the catastrophic flooding of @entity4 during @entity5 in 2005			1
on monday , an appeals court threw that decision out			1
the new court decision , which potentially gets the government off the hook for tens of millions of dollars in damages , is based on a legal provision specifically designed to keep courts from second - guessing government decisions when the government is sued for its actions or inaction			1
residents of @entity4 , where more than 1,000 people were killed and many thousands made homeless in one of the worst disasters in @entity24 history , have been suing the corps , arguing that it failed to maintain a @entity27 river canal and did n't protect the city properly from the storm			1
a federal judge issued a blistering decision against the corps in 2009 , accusing it of negligence over a period of 40 years because of " insouciance , myopia and short - sightedness			1
" the real trouble begins after the storm @entity24 district court judge @entity40 awarded hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages to each of five families that lived in the worst - hit sections of the city : the @entity47 and @entity48			2
the ruling opened the way for about 100,000 other homes and businesses in the affected area to claim compensation , theoretically making the government liable for tens of millions of dollars			2
but a higher court reversed the decision monday			2
the appeals court found that the government could not be held responsible because of a provision known as the discretionary function exception , or @entity62 , which says the government ca n't be sued for actions that an agency or government employee makes , or fails to make , if the function is discretionary			1
the @entity62 is intended to prevent courts from second - guessing government decisions " grounded in social , economic , and political policy " during the course of lawsuits , the appeals court said			1
" our application of the @entity62 ... completely insulates the government from liability , " the three judges hearing the case wrote			2
monday 's ruling is not final			0
plaintiffs can ask the full 5th @entity81 to rehear the case , or they can appeal to the @entity24 @entity83			0
@entity5 made landfall on the morning of august 29 , 2005 , between @entity85 , @entity86 , and the mouth of the @entity88			0
a few hours later , the storm again crossed over land on the other side of the river , its winds only slightly diminished			0
once a category 5 storm , it had weakened to a category 3 storm with 127 mph winds when it hit			0
@entity5 devastated @entity4 when the city 's levee system failed and widespread flooding occurred			1
more than 1,800 people died in the storm , nearly 1,600 in @entity86			0
overall , the storm damage covered more than 90,000 square miles and displaced nearly 300,000 people , causing more than $ 81 billion in damage			0
the @entity106 called @entity5 " the single most catastrophic natural disaster in @entity24 history			0
" the plaintiffs who sued the government said the @entity2 ' failure to properly maintain the @entity112 made the flooding significantly worse than it would otherwise have been			1
in the 2009 district court ruling , @entity40 wrote that because the corps failed to maintain the shipping channel , erosion widened it , and its banks -- which helped protect the levees -- deteriorated , leaving the levees unprotected , undermined and more vulnerable to waves coming off @entity122			2
the corps also failed to take other actions , such as armoring the banks with rocks , attorneys for the plaintiffs said			0
@entity0 's @entity129 and @entity130 contributed to this report .			0

an appeals court says the government is *immune* from the lawsuit
residents of @entity4 sued the corps , saying its failures made flooding worse
an earlier ruling *blasted* the *engineers* for " myopia and short - sightedness "
the new ruling could get the government off the hook for potentially huge bills
