just like any other night in the @entity0 , the starting lineups of the @entity2 and visiting @entity3 were introduced over the public address system			1
but wednesday was n't just any night at @entity6 's @entity5			1
and the loudest ovations were not for members of either team			2
@entity10 , 12 , who is rapidly losing his eyesight due to retinitis pigmentosa , was in the house to fulfill his final seeing wish : watch his beloved @entity2 play a game			1
" @entity19 ! " flashed on all four sides of the @entity17 to thunderous applause			2
" i 'm quite excited to be here for the game , " @entity20 told @entity22 affiliate @entity21			1
while the reason for his long journey from @entity31 , @entity32 , was distressing , the circumstances that brought two communities on opposite sides of the planet together were extraordinary			2
@entity20 's progressive disorder will eventually deteriorate his vision			1
faced with the grim reality that he will soon lose the ability to see the world around him , his parents wanted to give their youngest of five children an international sightseeing tour			1
" this year we 're going to try and fill his world with as many beautiful images as we can , " his mother , @entity42 , told @entity22			1
@entity20 was instructed to make something of an ocular bucket list -- things and places he 'd like to see for the first , only and likely last time			2
he picked places such as the @entity51 , @entity52 , the @entity53 and , in a sign of the times , @entity57 headquarters in @entity58			2
but the thing he wanted to experience the most was n't a landmark or a national park			2
an avid sports fan , @entity20 wanted to take in a game			1
and not just any game -- the @entity2			1
" for some reason , he really got hooked on @entity69 basketball , " his mom said			2
" he cares about nothing else			2
he is really quite passionate about it			2
" making the list was the easy part			2
getting there , however , would be trickier			0
with @entity20 's eyesight rapidly fading -- by 50 % in the past year alone -- the trip was going to have to be soon			1
like , matter - of - weeks soon			0
@entity77 , the ceo of a @entity6 - based software firm , stepped in with a hefty donation and the promise to raise even more			0
the fact that @entity77 's company is based in @entity6 -- the very place @entity20 was headed -- had nothing to do with why he got involved			0
" that was a random coincidence , " he told @entity22			0
" i did it because the @entity87 are my next - door neighbors			0
" @entity77 makes the 24 - hour - plus trek from his @entity31 home to his office in downtown @entity6 every six weeks			0
he got @entity91 to pick up @entity20 's airfare tab and donated his own points as well			0
@entity77 and his partners at @entity95 agreed to pay for the trip no matter how much was raised while friends and strangers from opposite sides of the planet donated about $ 25,000 in just four weeks			1
" it is so touching , " @entity42 said			0
" people are just so supportive			0
" the fundraising campaign soon picked up steam on social media , reaching strangers far and wide			0
" somebody tweeted me an article about this boy in @entity32 and told me i should read it , " said @entity107 , who lives outside of @entity6			0
@entity112 is the incoming chair of the trustees at the @entity115 , one of the oldest schools for the visually impaired in the country			0
her son , 21 - year - old @entity119 , was blinded by a condition similar to @entity20 's			0
" i completely understood where the @entity87 were coming from in wanting to build a visual memory bank for ( @entity123 ) , " @entity107 said			0
" it 's an incredibly difficult thing to have to go through			0
" but that was n't the only coincidence ; @entity107 's husband just so happens to own the @entity2			1
" of course when i read about how he was a big @entity2 fan , i knew that we had to have him come for a game , " she said			1
the coincidences did n't end there			0
when @entity112 learned that the @entity87 would be coming to @entity6 for their game on march 5 , she realized she would be unable to give @entity20 her seats because she had given them away			1
" march 5th had coincidentally been scheduled as @entity136 at the @entity5 ( home of the @entity2 ) , " she said			1
" we 'd already given away our seats to the school 's students , families and donors			0
" while @entity112 made sure @entity20 and his family had great seats -- practically on the @entity2 bench -- she says the real show was the @entity149 chorus singing the national anthem			1
" i think for a 12 - year - old like @entity20 , for him to be able to watch visually - impaired kids perform the national anthem on a national stage , for him to see what blind people can achieve , that 's going to give him the lasting memory , " she said			1
and his @entity6 trip was filled with other coincidences as well			1
he spent the day tuesday at the @entity161 , whose cutting - edge ocular research may one day turn @entity20 's " farewell to vision " tour into simply one heck of a trip			1
those odds might be long , but smart money would n't bet against @entity20			0
he seems to have serendipity on his side .			0

*doctors* say @entity174 , 12 , will soon lose his vision due to rare *disease*
