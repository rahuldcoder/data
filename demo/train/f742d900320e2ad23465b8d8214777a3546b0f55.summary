finally going back home to @entity1 this month after toiling for 13 years in @entity3 , migrant worker @entity2 was looking forward to being reunited with her child			1
but as she waited at the airport departure gates she could n't help noticing the distressed condition of one of her compatriots			1
with blackened skin and obviously in pain , @entity9 told @entity2 her condition was due to a skin allergy exacerbated by the winter cold			1
but when she could n't stand up to walk to the departure gate , @entity2 knew that something was seriously wrong			1
@entity9 was so weak , @entity2 put her on a trolley to wheel her to the gate			1
eventually , she had to help her onto the plane			0
allegations of torture " she said , ' i 'm scared			0
' i asked her why and told her she did n't need to be scared because i was there to help			0
i immediately took photos of her hands , her body			0
i asked again , are you sure these are really from allergies ? " @entity2 told @entity30			1
" then she told me : ' the truth is i was tortured by my employer			0
she beat me up and did n't give enough food to eat			0
i got very weak so she sent me home			0
' " i told her we should report it to the police but she said ' no , i 'm scared because she threatened to have my parents killed by her husband 's friends			2
' " @entity2 , one of four @entity1 workers who came to the aid of @entity42 at @entity43 , traveled with the ailing domestic helper to her home in @entity46 , @entity47 , and stayed on to help her			1
" because i 'm already involved , i refuse to be silent , " @entity2 said			1
" i ca n't accept what happened , that kind of torture			0
how she suffered while she was walking , while she was sitting ( at the airport )			2
i wonder what she went through during the months she worked there			0
" despite abuses , foreign domestic workers still flock to @entity3 arrest made @entity9 's case is now at the center of an investigation and protests by thousands of people who rallied in @entity3 on sunday to demand justice for the young @entity1 maid			1
allegedly beaten by her employer in a case that has sparked outrage and a police investigation into accusations of torture , @entity9 's plight has drawn attention to the risks faced by migrant workers in @entity76 and the @entity78 regions			1
the employer also threatened to kill @entity9 and her family if she revealed the abuse she suffered , @entity82 , head of the @entity1 @entity84 , told the @entity85			1
on monday afternoon police arrested a 44 - year - old housewife believed to be connected with the case at the @entity3 airport			1
police combined @entity9 's case with that of another @entity1 maid who was allegedly abused by the same person			1
after finding similarities in the cases , officers decided to pursue both investigations together , said @entity98 , the police chief of @entity99 , a district of @entity3 , in a press conference monday night			0
@entity9 is now recovering from her injuries at a hospital in @entity103 , a city in @entity105 , after flying out from @entity3 in early january			1
the maid had suffered extensive injuries but her condition was stabilizing , the @entity85 reported			2
' live - in law ' questioned at the heart of the issue is a @entity3 law that requires domestic helpers to live with their employers			1
while domestic helpers in @entity3 are guaranteed a minimum wage of hk $ 3,920 ( $ 505 ) a month under heavily policed labor laws , support groups say the live - in law contributes to abuse			2
@entity3 's @entity121 ( @entity121 ) released a study last year based on interviews with more than 3,000 foreign domestic workers			2
it found that almost one third had no proper accommodation within the house			0
" they do not have their own room provided and have to either share the bedroom with other members of the household or sleep in common areas of the apartment , such as the living room , study or playroom where there is very little privacy , " the study reported			0
" some even sleep in unsuitable spaces such as the bathroom , toilets , veranda , corridor , kitchen and storage rooms , with only makeshift beds on top of ovens , cupboards or bathtubs			0
there are foreign domestic workers that are forced to share the room with young adult male members of the household , " it added			0
@entity121 director @entity160 told @entity3 media that the government requirement that maids must live with their employer meant they had nowhere to run when they were abused			2
she said the decision should be left to the employers and the maids whether they live together			2
she also urged the government to scrap a policy that requires domestic helpers to leave @entity3 just two weeks after their contracts expire , saying it did not give workers enough time to find new work			2
" it often forces the helpers to endure abuses so they can hold on to their jobs , " she said , adding that they needed the jobs to support their families back home			0
