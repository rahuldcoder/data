@entity0 , @entity1 -- critics and supporters of the @entity12 administration alike , others concerned foremost about national security , the so - called whistle - blowers of @entity4 , and both @entity6 allies and enemies believe the released diplomatic documents contain significant revelations about @entity6 foreign policy			1
but is this perception accurate ? this convergence of opinion from such conflicting groups is based on the premise that a document stands on its own			2
read a memo , and you have the whole story			2
but if historians and other scholars believed raw data mean nothing more than what appears on the page , they would have little need to write analyses creating or challenging conventional wisdom , nor would they need to spend long shifts in archives poring over aging documents			1
in fact , revisionism of any sort would be unnecessary unless , of course , new documents emerged			0
the influence of social forces , economic interests , history , bureaucracy and the many other factors responsible for shaping information would be relegated to the margins or unconsidered			0
@entity4 and the @entity53 , among others , claim they must analyze documents before publishing them to determine which names and facts to redact and how much context to provide			1
this is not how historians practice their craft , and the absence of careful analysis may prove to be as harmful to national security as the revelation of sensitive material			1
historical analysis cautions against accepting a single document as a smoking gun			1
it compels the investigator to study primary and secondary sources , and it is a reminder that what is left unstated in a document may be far more revealing than what is stated			1
i confronted this when i delved into the private papers of president @entity79 nearly 15 years ago			0
@entity79 gave me access to her husband 's papers on the end of the @entity84 , but that research took a sharp detour when i discovered thousands of pages of @entity79 's handwritten drafts covering more than 70 years of his life			0
before the publication of my co-authored books on @entity79 's writings , it was not widely known that the 40th president wrote thousands of letters throughout his life			0
one letter , written in november 1986 , illustrates the importance of historical context			1
frustrated by accounts in the press , @entity79 wrote to @entity102 , then publisher of the @entity103 : " i 'm really upset by what so many of your contemporaries have done			0
@entity107 -- n it yes we sold them a few spare parts and weapons but the stake was a contact that could give us a chance at a relationship with @entity117 and we were succeeding			0
a plus on the [ other ] side was return of three hostages and could have been five if the media had n't blown our cover			2
" if you read only this letter , unaware that it had already been revealed that the @entity6 had sold arms to @entity117 in hopes that the @entity117 government would cease support for terrorism and thus facilitate the release of @entity6 citizens held hostage in @entity134 , and that @entity79 had publicly discussed the issue on several occasions , you might see the quote as revelatory			0
it has significance , but not in the sense of it being news never heard before			2
under a mountain of readily available information , we are gradually losing the art of understanding			0
we face a different kind of threat to national security , perhaps the most dangerous threat of all			0
the historian 's craft must be part of the public debate about the documents released by @entity4			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity158 .			1

@entity160 says historians know raw data need to be analyzed and put in *perspective*
primary and secondary sources and historical context must be considered , she writes
she says *undifferentiated* @entity4 material does n't make sense without analysis
@entity158 says *jumping* to ready conclusions will lead to *misunderstandings*
