-- people have strong views about the way police officers treat minorities -- and they 're eager to share those opinions			1
that became clear after @entity0 asked people on @entity9 to use # @entity10 to pose questions to police officers			1
police conduct has been in the spotlight since the deaths of @entity16 and @entity17			0
the idea was that the network would use that hashtag to mine social media for questions to ask current and former police officers for a show that aired tuesday night			1
people on @entity9 responded in force , making # askacop a trending hashtag well into wednesday			1
people posted message after message -- but many of them were eager to make a point rather than ask a question			0
this reaction was not necessarily what was intended when the network asked : " are you curious about the police point of view re : recent @entity41 protests ? " for the show on tuesday night			2
the show featured a calm , civil , evocative conversation with police officers			1
what unfolded online was a different story , with the proposal stirring up a lot of raw emotion			0
a majority of these tweets echoed the views of protesters in recent weeks , who have loudly railed against police in @entity41 for -- in their opinion -- profiling african - americans			2
many of them claim that @entity16 , @entity17 and other unarmed black men who died at the hands of white police officers might still be alive today if not for the color of their skin			1
some were sarcastic , like one man who asked , " if 1 black man has zero guns , zero knives and 2 hands , how many bullets does it take to disarm him ? " another on wednesday openly wondered , " if i 'm only a quarter black do i get the benefit of the doubt before you shoot me ? " others expressed the distrust some minorities have for police nowadays			2
for example , a " young black / @entity83 woman " asked , " any tips for who i 'm supposed to teach my future children to go to if they need help ? " some slammed what they called the " senseless , excessive force and police brutality " of some officers			2
one person suggested that the words " @entity93 " rather than " serve and protect " should be on cruisers			0
and one wrote , " when you were a child , did you want to grow & do heroic things ? what went wrong ? " of course , even if such voices dominated # @entity10 , this debate is anything but one - sided			0
many have defended police , saying they put their lives on the line daily and must make difficult , split - second decisions intended to save others			0
they say police are civil servants who work , day and night , to make this country safe -- not to divide it			0
that sentiment was reflected some on @entity9 , like one person who posted a picture of three white officers surrounding a young , handicapped black boy with the words , " defend our first responders			1
" another wrote , " @entity121 if they know people are praying every day that they make the right choices in their stressful jobs			2
" at the least , the @entity10 hashtag showed that , while grand juries have their made decisions on the deaths of @entity16 and @entity17 , this debate is n't over			0
whether intended or not , this social media endeavor became another forum for people to voice their strong views on this topic			0
as one man tweeted , " if you really want to see what the public thinks of police officers just take a look at # @entity10			1

@entity0 starts # @entity121 so people can pose police questions amid great debate
many @entity9 users pick up on the hashtag , using it to vent at police officers
some suggest black people are treated differently , more at risk from police
" just take a look at @entity121 " to see public *'s* view of police , one man tweets
