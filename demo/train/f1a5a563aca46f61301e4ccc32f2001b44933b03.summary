-- in 1999 , @entity1 was unexpectedly catapulted to stardom as a co-creator and costar of the indie horror film " the @entity5 " -- who memorably filmed herself crying in terror in the genre - breaking flick			1
a few short years later , just as unexpectedly , her acting career stalled			1
and soon she was embarking on the most peculiar of second acts -- that of marijuana grower			1
" i took all my stuff into the desert related to my acting career and burned it all , " @entity1 , who turns 37 on thursday , tells the @entity14			1
well , she did spare one thing : the blue ski cap from the " @entity5 " poster			1
" that 's the only thing i kept , " she says			2
" i figured if things got really bad , i could always sell it on @entity24			2
" at the time of " @entity5 's " release , @entity1 told people that her newfound fame was " hilarious and overwhelming			1
" but soon she became disillusioned			0
" the acting projects i was lucky enough to work on were n't always things that i felt good about putting out into the world , " she says now in a q&a on her website			2
" i did n't see that getting better as i got older			0
i wanted to change my life , see what else was out there for me , what else i might become			2
" she ended up following her then new boyfriend into a strange new life of growing marijuana , mostly for medical purposes -- a journey she relates in her forthcoming memoir , " @entity44 : how @entity45 went to @entity46 " @entity1 ended up living for a year in @entity47 , @entity48 , with a bunch of growers and their " pot wives , " helping to build grow rooms and tending to the crops			1
she tells the @entity14 that she was " always an avid gardener " and quickly fell into a routine , becoming " a solitary country girl " after her years in the fast lane in @entity57 she gave up growing pot after deciding to write about it -- and after a friend got busted by the feds			2
@entity1 , who is now on a book tour , is torn about whether marijuana should be legalized			1
on the one hand , she 's worried that corporations might run over the mom - and - pop growers			0
but at the same time , she thinks it 's foolish to outlaw it			0
" cannabis has been intertwined with human culture for thousands of years , " she says on her website			0
" it 's here to stay as medicine , as an industry , and as a component of the culture			0
the idea that such a hearty , useful plant could be legislated out of existence seems pretty foolish , especially in retrospect			0
