asked whether he could go on another run like the one at the start of the 2011 season that saw him unbeaten for 43 matches he said in an on - court interview : " yes i am definitely am ( on a streak )			2
" but i am not thinking about it or trying to better the one i had in 2011 , because it 's really hard to ask from myself something which may be impossible			0
" but knowing that i have done it gives me that mental edge and confidence i need in to approach every tournament with self - belief			0
" @entity1 enjoys an impressive record over @entity7 , losing just once in their last 13 encounters , and broke his opponent 's first service game to set the tone for the match			1
though the world no. 44 put up a better fight in the second set , @entity1 rarely looked in any danger as he wrapped up the match in just over an hour			1
" because i have not played for a while i was extremely focused and committed to starting well , " @entity1 added			2
" i played really , really well in the first set			0
i read his serve well , and i was aggressive in the court			0
so altogether i am satisfied with my performance and i hope i can continue			0
" elsewhere , the no. 4 seed @entity63 was forced to save three match points during a hard fought 4 - 6 6 - 4 7 - 6 victory over @entity67 @entity66			1
the @entity68 , who won the 14th @entity17 title of his career in @entity72 recently , came close to losing the contest at 4 - 5 in the deciding set but battled back to take it on a tiebreak			2
he 's a great player , " @entity63 told the @entity17 's official website			0
" he fights like me every point , and we had fantastic rallies			0
i 'm so glad to beat him tonight in @entity11			0
" i played fantastic forehands to keep playing this match			0
then in the end , of course , you need a little bit of luck to win these kinds of matches , and i think i played solid on important points in the third			0
" @entity92 , the no. 3 seed , had no such problems as he accounted for @entity97 wild card @entity95 6 - 1 6 - 3 in less than an hour			1
