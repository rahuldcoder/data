-- this year is on track to be the worst for measles in more than a decade , according to new numbers released thursday by the @entity4			1
and people who refuse to vaccinate their children are behind the increasing number of outbreaks , health officials say			1
there were 159 cases of measles in the @entity13 from january 1 through august 24 , according to the @entity4			1
if that trend continues , there will be more cases in 2013 than in any year since 1996 , when some 500 cases were reported			2
the number would also surpass that of 2011 , when there were 222 cases			1
measles cases in the @entity13 numbered in the hundreds of thousands before the advent of vaccination , and dropped dramatically throughout the 1960s			1
the disease was thought to have been eradicated in 2000 , but the numbers have recently crept back up , largely because of visitors from countries where measles is common and because of vaccine objectors within the @entity13			1
nearly two - thirds of the reported cases happened in three outbreaks in communities where many people do n't vaccinate their children for religious or philosophical reasons			1
" this is very bad			0
this is horrible , " said dr. @entity38 , a pediatric infectious disease expert at @entity40 who was on a telephone briefing with the @entity4 thursday morning			0
" the complications of measles are not to be toyed with , and they 're not altogether rare			2
" according to the @entity4 , one to three out of every 1,000 children in the @entity13 who get measles will die from the disease , even with the best of care			1
even if complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis are n't deadly , they can make children very sick ; in 2011 , nearly 40 % of children under the age of 5 who got measles had to be treated in the hospital			1
@entity60 usually starts with a fever , which can get very high , followed by a cough , runny nose and red eyes			0
soon a rash of tiny , red spots will start at the head and spread to the rest of the body			0
the rash can last a week and coughing can last for up to 10 days			0
@entity38 said he 's concerned younger physicians might not be quick to recognize the signs of measles , since there have been only pockets of the disease since 2000			0
" many young pediatricians might not know what measles looks like , " he said			0
among those who have been stricken with measles this year , 92 % were not vaccinated or had unknown vaccination status			2
the largest outbreak was in @entity85 , where 58 people contracted measles in a community where many refuse to be vaccinated for religious reasons			2
those who choose not to vaccinate put other people 's babies at risk , since babies can not be vaccinated until their first birthday , and are therefore vulnerable to the disease			2
" i hope that those who are vaccine hesitant or vaccine avoidant realize there are consequences to their actions , " @entity38 said			0
" none of us lives in isolation			0
" ex-staffer : @entity107 counseled faith , not shots , for measles			0

nearly 40 % of children under the age of five who get measles have to be hospitalized
