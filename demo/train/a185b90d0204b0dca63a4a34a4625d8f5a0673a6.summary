-- @entity4 election officials can go ahead and enforce a controversial voter identification law opposed by the @entity8 administration and civil rights groups , the @entity2 @entity1 said early saturday			1
the decision comes just two days before early voting begins in the state			0
@entity2 attorney general @entity12 said it was " a major step backward to let stand a law ... ( that was ) designed to discriminate			1
" @entity12 : my work on voting rights most important " it is true we are close to an election , " @entity12 said saturday , " but the outcome here that would be least confusing to voters is the one that allowed the most people to vote lawfully			2
a civil rights leader reacted harshly to the ruling , calling it an " affront to our democracy			1
" " today 's decision means hundreds of thousands of eligible voters in @entity4 will be unable to participate in november 's election because @entity4 has erected an obstacle course designed to discourage voting , " said @entity32 , president of the @entity33			1
a spokeswoman for the @entity4 attorney general 's office , however , lauded the decision			1
" we are pleased that the @entity2 @entity1 has agreed that @entity4 ' voter id law should remain in effect for the upcoming election , " spokeswoman @entity42 said			1
" the state will continue to defend the voter id law and remains confident that the district court 's misguided ruling will be overturned on the merits			1
the @entity2 @entity1 has already ruled that voter id laws are a legal and sensible way to protect the integrity of elections			1
" while the court offered no reasoning for its decision , it backs up a federal appeals court ruling tuesday saying that voting procedures should n't be upended so close to the election			2
that decision came in response to a federal judge 's ruling after a nine - day trial that a @entity4 law requiring voters to show photo id at the polls is unconstitutional			1
" the @entity1 has repeatedly instructed courts to consider the importance of preserving the status quo on the eve of an election , " the @entity71 said			2
proponents say the law will help prevent voter fraud			0
critics say such practices make it harder for poor , minority and disabled people to vote			0
minority and civil rights groups who banded together to oppose the law said it was among the most restrictive in the nation			0
some 600,000 people in @entity4 lack state - issued ids , according to the @entity91 -- which rejected the law as a violation of the @entity94			2
nationwide , the @entity33 says 25 % of african - americans and 16 % of @entity96 of voting age lack a current government - issued photo id			0
saturday 's decision does n't speak to the constitutionality of the law -- only whether it can be enforced in this fall 's election			2
continued legal challenges are a certainty , @entity32 said			0
while the court 's majority did n't offer any explanation for the ruling , justice @entity107 wrote a nearly seven - page dissent , joined by justices @entity113 and @entity115			0
@entity107 said the costs associated with the law -- obtaining identity cards and the documents needed to get them -- are n't as insignificant as backers claim , and argued they harken back to the use of the poll tax in the late 1800s and early 1900s as a method of preventing blacks from voting			0
" the greatest threat to public confidence in elections in this case is the prospect of enforcing a purposefully discriminatory law , one that likely imposes an unconstitutional poll tax and risks denying the right to vote to hundreds of thousands of eligible voters , " @entity107 wrote			0
the first day of early voting in @entity4 is monday			0
voters will choose a new governor to replace outgoing gov. @entity142 , new lieutenant governor , and new attorney general , in addition to voting on one of the state 's @entity148 seats and several @entity151 districts			1
