it was @entity1 : wave upon wave of allied troops storming the coast of northern @entity5 to liberate the country and its people from @entity9 occupation , in the largest seaborne invasion in history			2
braving everything from heavy seas to machine gun fire and grenades , soldiers clambered ashore at beaches codenamed @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 and began to fight their way inland			1
thousands died in the attempt ; today their bodies fill military cemeteries along the @entity29 coast			1
some of their former comrades make the trip back to @entity5 every year			0
" i do n't want them to be forgotten ... it 's too early , " explained retired staff sergeant @entity32 , laying a wreath at the @entity35 cemetery			1
but with each year that passes , fewer and fewer survive to keep the memory of what happened alive			0
for @entity43 , there is an added reason why landing at @entity45 is something he could never forget : it was his 21st birthday			0
" i landed in @entity29 on my 21st , " he says			1
" i remember saying to a friend -- it 's my birthday today @entity50 , and he said : ' it seems a pretty good day to have it			2
' but of course once you are on those boats you are n't thinking about birthdays			2
" a gunner with @entity58 's @entity57 , @entity43 was there to support troops who had captured the beach three days earlier			2
" we were going to join the division that landed on d - day which required more support from guns , and that was our job			2
we landed on the 9th , we were there in support of the infantry division ; within about an hour of landing we were firing guns			0
" @entity43 lost some of his closest friends in the fighting that followed			2
just weeks before the end of the conflict , he was captured by the @entity80 -- his family were told he was missing in action , and presumed dead -- before being freed by @entity35 soldiers			1
" i have often wondered since , many times , how my mother must have felt having a telegram from the @entity87 saying [ i was ] missing , believed killed , and then a voice comes on the phone and says ' @entity91 , ' " he says			0
" it must have been stunning			0
" seventy years on from d - day , preparations have been in full swing for months : new flags and banners have gone up , the grass at the cemeteries has been neatly trimmed , and everything has been given a spit and polish ahead of the anniversary visit by world leaders including @entity104 and @entity35 president @entity105			1
@entity106 from @entity29 was planning to plant red , white and blue flowers in front of his house when @entity110 visited -- his flags were already flying proudly			1
" with me they are up every year , " he said			0
" it is an honor for me to decorate and commemorate all the soldiers who died			0
" the cathedral at @entity117 has a new bronze bell to mark the anniversary			1
local priest , father @entity120 , said it celebrated " peace and reconciliation between the different countries , and between @entity5 and @entity80 , and the friendship between the @entity35 and @entity5 and @entity126			2
" but @entity120 said not all of those in @entity29 have completely positive memories of the liberation -- some ca n't forget how destructive it was			1
@entity133 , 87 , told @entity110 his village never joins in the commemorations , because it was almost completely destroyed by the fighting			0
this year , @entity5 president @entity137 has ordered that attention be focused on the civilian losses as well as the military ones ; it is estimated that , during the @entity29 campaign alone , 20,000 @entity5 civilians lost their lives			1
three - quarters of @entity145 , where @entity137 and more than a dozen heads of state and government will gather this week , was destroyed by the fighting when @entity80 troops held out there in the months following @entity94 , prompting the @entity150 to lay siege to the city			1
scars left by the conflict remain , 70 years later			0
but many of today 's residents of @entity29 are simply grateful for the actions of those soldiers -- in some cases , decades before they were even born			1
" my gratitude is huge , " says law student @entity160			0
" i am blessing every day the heroes who came to rescue us			0
" on june 6 , others will say thank you in their own way			1
@entity35 jazz pianist @entity167 will perform alongside more than 100 teenagers from schools across the @entity35 and @entity5 , offering a musical tribute to those who fought in @entity171 " it 's a tiny and fairly insignificant way of giving back to a lot of veterans who went before us and died , fighting for an idea , a very important idea that i think some of the modern wars somewhat lost , " he explained			1
" the landings in @entity29 were an important moral event			2
it was n't a war for oil , prestige or power			0
it was for an idea -- maybe the last time in our history that i can think of that it has been the case			0
" for decades since the war 's end , @entity43 has declined to take part in events commemorating @entity94			1
" it is n't me , " he explains			0
" it 's like wearing medals , you know			0
i do n't want to walk up and down with medals on saying : ' look at me			0
' " but this year , on the 70th anniversary of the decisive battle , @entity43 will be in @entity29 to pay tribute to those who fell , alongside other elderly veterans and world leaders			1
" i am extremely fortunate to be as fit as well as i am , but obviously it ca n't last forever -- [ i 'm ] 91 on june 9 , " he says			2
" in so much as it could well be the last time , i shall go			0
" as one of the last remaining soldiers who can recall those bloody days in june 1944 , he hopes that such battles remain firmly in the past			1
" it would be a dream to say stop wars but at least reduce them , because at the end of a war what have you got ? no - one 's won anything			2
millions dead and you still have the same problem			0
" what to know about d - day @entity94 - myth and reality @entity229 's ' soul - racking ' @entity94 decision			1

world leaders , veterans gather to mark 70th anniversary of @entity94
on june 6 , 1944 , soldiers stormed the beaches of @entity29 to take on the @entity237
many killed in battle and fighting which followed ; military cemeteries line coast
