-- it 's a mind - boggling surprise in whodunit mysteries and soap operas , but a soldier in @entity6 is using the dramatic ploy for real in a criminal courtroom : his " evil twin " may be responsible for the sex crimes against girls that he 's now accused of			1
the soldier 's defense rests partly on the fact he and his identical twin brother have virtually the same dna , an attempt to undercut authorities ' allegations that the dna from the crime scenes belongs to the soldier			1
the defendant , @entity23 , 32 , is also a suspect in sex crimes in two other states , authorities say			1
in addition to raising his twin brother as a suspect , @entity23 also claims that a third man may be the culprit in some of the crimes , court papers say			1
a @entity6 judge in @entity34 ruled last week that @entity23 will be allowed to name his twin brother , @entity35 , as a suspect in his defense			1
the judge also allowed the defense attorneys to use the name of a third man as a suspect , too			2
the twin brother , who has n't been charged in the any of the crimes , could not be reached by @entity0 for comment			2
so - called " evil twin " defenses have been used before in courtrooms , experts say			0
defendants with an identical twin have sometimes accused the sibling as the real culprit to try to create reasonable doubt and seek acquittal , but the finger - pointing is n't a sure - fire strategy , said @entity0 legal analyst @entity58 , who 's also a criminal defense attorney			2
" no two of us have the same set of dna -- with one exception and that is identical twins , " @entity58 said			0
" cases like this are interesting , " he added			0
" each twin essentially has to come up with an alibi , and we 're seeing that in this case and seeing it in other cases			0
it comes down to whose alibi is a little bit better			0
you can imagine the complexity if both twins are in the same geographic area at the same time of the crime			0
" in fact , both @entity23 brothers lived in @entity85 and @entity86 , where the other sexual assaults occurred , but authorities in @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity6 say @entity89 is the focus of their investigations , @entity6 prosecutors said			1
@entity35 has been to @entity6 only once in the past decade and did n't visit @entity34 , according to the @entity92 , citing a police detective 's testimony last week			0
@entity89 , a decorated @entity96 officer assigned to @entity97 in @entity92 , is accused of trying to lure 11 girls between ages 6 and 9 and sexually assaulting three of them , authorities said			1
in all , @entity89 faces 27 charges in six cases , officials said			0
prosecutors want all the cases to be heard together , but defense attorneys do not			0
a hearing is scheduled for tuesday to address the prosecution 's request			0
the 27 charges include two counts of second - degree kidnapping with a sex offense on a child ; one count of kidnapping with enticement of a child ; two counts of aggravated sexual assault on a child ; four counts of attempted sexual assault on a child ; one count of sexual assault on a child ; and other charges			0
@entity89 is also charged with being a fugitive from justice in the @entity85 and @entity86 cases			1
the @entity6 crimes occurred in @entity132 , @entity92 and unincorporated @entity34 from summer 2010 until late 2012 , when @entity89 was arrested , @entity0 affiliate @entity130 reported last year			2
the @entity6 crimes began at the same time that @entity89 was first stationed at @entity97 , the affiliate reported			2
both of the @entity86 and @entity85 cases " involve dna evidence that the prosecution states matches the dna of @entity89 , " defense attorneys said in court papers			1
when @entity89 was arrested last year , @entity6 authorities took his dna and ran the findings in a national law enforcement database , said police in @entity146 , @entity85 , and @entity147 , @entity86			1
his dna matched samples found in unsolved sex crimes in those jurisdictions , police said			2
but @entity89 offers a different interpretation of those findings			0
" @entity89 has an identical twin brother , @entity35 , who has ( a ) similar dna profile , " @entity89 ' attorneys said in court documents			1
" additionally , witness statements from the @entity85 case describe a vehicle matching that of @entity35 being in the area of the attack prior to the assault			0
" the defense believes that mr. @entity35 contributed the dna in the @entity85 and @entity86 cases and that it is his dna that was found during those crimes , not @entity89 's			1
" @entity89 also argues that some of the @entity92 sex crimes may have been committed by a man who had been arrested for indecent exposure , defense attorneys said in court papers			1
that man , whose name is listed in court papers , also " bears a striking resemblance to the descriptions provided by several of the complaining witnesses ( and ) owned and drove vehicles matching the descriptions of the vehicles driven by the alleged perpetrator , " the attorneys said			0
@entity89 's attorneys said it is unclear whether the twin brother will be compelled to appear during the trial , expected to begin in january .			2

@entity89 is charged with trying to lure 11 girls and sexually assaulting three of them
he is also a suspect in sex crimes in @entity85 and @entity86
but @entity23 ' defense attorneys say the dna could belong to his brother , an identical twin
a @entity6 judge allows @entity23 to cite his twin brother as a *potential* suspect
