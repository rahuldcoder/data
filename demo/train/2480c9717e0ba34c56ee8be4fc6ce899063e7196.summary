@entity0 , @entity1 -- a judge has concluded that 13 - year - old @entity4 , who suffered complications after tonsil surgery , is brain dead			1
but it 's unclear what will happen next to the @entity1 teen			2
an attorney representing her family told reporters they have n't decided yet whether to appeal the judge 's decision , which came after a court - appointed doctor testified tuesday that @entity4 was brain dead			1
the judge has ruled that @entity4 will remain on life support at least until december 30			1
family members said they planned to spend @entity22 in her hospital room , opening gifts and sipping hot chocolate			1
earlier tuesday , @entity27 argued that the court should lift a restraining order that requires life support for the girl			2
" because ms. @entity4 is dead , practically and legally , there is no course of medical treatment to continue or discontinue ; there is nothing to which the family 's consent is applicable , " the hospital wrote in court papers			1
standing outside the courthouse on tuesday , family members said they were hoping for a holiday miracle while @entity4 remains hospitalized			1
" @entity22 is tomorrow , so it 'd be great if she woke up tomorrow			0
... if this was your daughter , would n't you want her to wake up in the next five minutes ? " said @entity46 , the girl 's uncle			1
mother : ' i wo n't stop fighting ' for daughter complications after tonsil surgery @entity4 was declared brain dead december 12 , three days after tonsil surgery			1
the case has drawn national attention and sparked protests from some local leaders who say the hospital should have provided better care			0
on monday , a judge appointed dr. @entity65 , chief of pediatric neurology at @entity67 , to evaluate @entity4 as an independent expert			1
@entity65 testified tuesday that @entity4 meets the criteria for brain death			1
@entity72 judge @entity71 previously ruled that the hospital must hold off on any decisions regarding discontinuing life support until december 30 and encouraged both sides to work together			1
" this is a very , very charged case			0
the stakes are very high			0
there is a young girl involved , and i think it would suit both parties well if you would speak with each other about how we are going to get through the next few days , " @entity71 said			0
attorney : family needs to process judge 's ruling attorney @entity90 said family members need to evaluate what the judge said on tuesday before they decide on their next move			1
" this involves some very serious religious beliefs about life and death , " he said			0
but he said he hoped the judge 's decision sends a message to hospitals everywhere : " the parents come first			2
" " what this case represents legally is that parents can say no when a hospital says , ' we 're pulling the plug			0
' they thought that a hospital should n't tell them their child was going to be removed from a ventilator , " @entity90 told reporters			2
@entity116 vows to keep fighting mother @entity118 has said she 'll keep fighting no matter what			2

any mother would do it , " @entity118 said in an exclusive interview with @entity2 's " @entity124 " on monday			2
" i just want her to have more time			2
there are so many stories of people waking up in her situation			0
" doctors say people do n't wake up from @entity4 's situation and that in her arguments , @entity118 has pointed to cases in which the patient had brain activity			1
" children 's is currently merely preserving ms. @entity4 's body from the natural post-mortem course of events			1
there is no legal , ethical or moral requirement that it continue to do so or that the family consent in the decision to stop doing so , " the hospital 's filing said			2
" we have the deepest sympathy for @entity4 's mother , who wishes her daughter was alive ; but the ventilator can not reverse the brain death that has occurred and it would be wrong to give false hope that @entity4 will ever come back to life , " dr. @entity149 , the hospital 's chief of pediatrics , said in a statement monday			1
@entity118 told @entity2 on monday that she 'd seen recent improvements in her daughter 's condition			0
a hospital monitor suggests her daughter is trying to breathe on her own , she said			0
" they told me without your brain , you ca n't take your own breath , " @entity118 said			1
" well , she 's trying , so that means something 's working			0
" hospital says they 're investigating @entity149 said monday that hospital officials are looking into the matter and are " committed to learning what led to this catastrophic outcome			0
" " we are sorry that @entity4 suffered tragic complications from her complex surgery , " he said			1
" our hearts go out to the grieving family and community about this sad situation			2
" in its court filing tuesday , the hospital also fought against a request by @entity118 to bring in dr. @entity189 as an expert to study the case			0
@entity189 , a neonatologist and pediatrician , wrote on the website @entity194 that he believes " @entity4 is not truly dead			1
" the political site pushes its view of the @entity197			0
he is " a crusader with an ideology - based bias , " and is " neither a neurologist nor a @entity1 physician , " the hospital argued			2
