-- what 's the best way to find great links on the web ? is it algorithmic search engines like @entity9 , people - powered decision - making , or a combination of both ? this has been the perennial question online ever since @entity15 's human - organized directory of web links lost the battle to @entity9 's automated crawlers			1
and yet now , in some circles at least , the pendulum appears to be swinging back : @entity9 is broken , say some technologists , and people - power is the best fix			1
what 's the problem with @entity9 search ? spam , say the critics			1
or rather , a new genre of not - quite - spam			2
so - called " content farms " have sprung up to produce thousands of articles per day with titles that match popular search terms -- dig in to the content however , and you 'll find it anything but useful			2
this @entity9 - fatigue began as early as december 2009 , when venture capitalist @entity38 remarked that using @entity9 to search for a new dishwasher delivered nothing but spam results			1
" info - krill " , @entity38 called it , " identify some words that show up in profitable searches -- from appliances , to mesothelioma suits , to kayak lessons -- churn out content cheaply and regularly , and you 're done			0
" it 's a concept that was revisited this month by prominent @entity53 blogger @entity52 , who remarked : " this year it really hit home just how badly @entity9 's systems have been spammed , as typically anything on page 1 of the search results was some form of @entity62 spam "			1
others have come to the same conclusion			0
prominent software developer @entity65 this month declared " @entity68 " , while entrepreneur @entity66 outlined his reasons " why we desperately need a new ( and @entity69 ) @entity9 " , namely " spammers and marketers "			2
developer @entity72 , meanwhile , decried the " apparent explosion recently of cheap - ' content ' sites " , which have contributed to " @entity9 's apparent defeat by spam			2
" while the problem is clear , do technologists agree on the solution ? it appears they do			2
@entity65 asks : " are we seeing the first signs that algorithmic search has failed as a strategy ? is the next generation of search destined to be less algorithmic and more social ? " @entity38 too proposes a human - powered solution , declaring that " curation is the new search			1
" @entity66 , meanwhile , points to new search engine contender @entity89 , which searches within sets of websites defined by human editors			0
and @entity72 proposes a combined approach : " one solution may be for @entity9 to radically change their algorithms and policies for web search to de-emphasize phrase - matching and more strongly prioritize inbound links and credibility			1
and , in what 's probably a huge departure for them , have human employees use their opinions of site quality to manually adjust the relevance of domains			0
" while i 'm inclined to agree that human - powered decision - making may increase the quality of search results , it 's worth noting that the path to " curation " is littered with bodies			1
in december 2010 , news leaked that @entity15 was looking to close down the social - bookmarking site @entity119			0
@entity15 later clarified that the company was instead looking to sell the service , which had pioneered wide - scale , people - powered categorization of web links			1
@entity15 's attempts to jettison the site are hardly a shining example of the rise of human curation			0
last year also saw the downfall of another web 2.0 pioneer -- @entity132 , which enables users to vote on web links and ranks the most popular results , saw its web traffic plummet after a redesign that aimed to keep pace with @entity139 and @entity140			0
it 's there , i think , where we might finally see curation bloom : on @entity139 and @entity140 , where users share millions of links per day without even the mildest sense that they 're " curators " of the web			0
to these everyday internet users , they 're just sharing cool websites with friends ; to those who seek to make sense of an increasingly complex web , these millions of social signals are gold dust			0
the solutions will come in many forms , from @entity162 's integration of @entity163 " into its search results to @entity139 - and @entity140 - powered newspapers like @entity166 and the @entity167			1
but ultimately , and with a few stumbles , we 'll find numerous ways to combine human judgment with the efficiency of algorithms .			0

@entity9 is broken , say some technologists , and people - power is the best fix
spam is the big problem with @entity9 search , critics say
one expert proposes a human - powered solution , says " curation is the new search "
