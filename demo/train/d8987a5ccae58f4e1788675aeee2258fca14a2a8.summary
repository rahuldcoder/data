-- @entity1 has returned to pro sports			1
but not in football -- and not to the standard of success he has been used to			0
the former @entity8 player of the year is competing in his first professional golf tournament as part of the @entity11 in his native @entity12 , but struggled to a 12 - over - par 84 in thursday 's opening round			1
" it 's a completely different game when you are under pressure , but i really enjoyed it still and so happy to be at this tournament , even if my scoring did n't go so good			0
it 's a great experience for me , " @entity1 told the @entity21 website			2
his playing partner , @entity23 @entity22 , was the first - round leader in the second - tier @entity25 event after a sharply contrasting course - record 64			1
" i am not a big fan of football so i did n't really know much about @entity1 but it was great to play with him			2
there were a lot of people watching , " the 28 - year - old said			1
every time i holed a putt he shook my hand or gave me a high five			0
he was really pushing me on to play better and cheering me when i made birdies so that was a really big help for me			0
" i did put it up on @entity41 that i was playing with him and it got a lot of responses , so i knew it was a big deal ! @entity1 , who enjoyed most of his success with @entity48 club @entity47 , retired from football a year ago after @entity12 co-hosted the @entity50 and has since dabbled in politics			1
he entered this tournament as one of several amateurs in the 130 - strong field , having initially taken up golf to help ease the pressure of playing elite football			1
" i come on to a golf course and turn off my phone and just walk the course and hit some balls			0
it 's one of the reasons why i started to play , " he said wednesday			0
" i just found this great game where you have to be focused and balanced and that 's why i like it			0
i like that mental balance			0
" @entity1 did manage one birdie , but he carded a double bogey and dropped shots at 11 other holes at the @entity74 and @entity76 course , which is part of a luxury seven - star facility			2
" to play with @entity22 and see him shoot a course record and play fantastic golf , i learned so much about the game from the two guys , " he said			0
@entity1 is n't the only athlete to try his hand at pro golf following a successful career in another sport			2
former tennis no. 1 @entity88 became @entity90 's national champion in 2011 -- he is also in the field this weekend in @entity12 -- and eight - time grand slam tennis winner @entity92 contested the @entity94 back in 1996			1
after @entity92 struck an 11 - over - par 82 in the first round , he was quoted as saying by the @entity96 that it was " five times worse than playing in a @entity98 final			0
" although similarly unlikely to make the halfway cut , and therefore miss out on the weekend action , @entity1 is nonetheless proud to be participating in his country 's first major golf tournament			1
" it 's the first event for me and also in @entity12 so it 's big for golf here , " he said			1
" i love golf and i 'm so happy that golf is starting to pick up in @entity12 and the people are starting to invest money long term			2
