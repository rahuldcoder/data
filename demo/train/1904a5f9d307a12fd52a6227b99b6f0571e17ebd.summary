-- it 's been nearly two years since @entity2 was shot dead , but the @entity5 teenager 's family still does n't know who pulled the trigger			1
now his mother and the @entity9 say the @entity12 @entity11 agents who they accuse of gunning him down must be brought to justice			1
in a federal lawsuit filed tuesday , they argue that the agents , who have n't been identified , used excessive force when they opened fire			1
@entity19 was 16 when he was found face - down in a pool of his own blood on the @entity5 side of the border in october 2012			2
his family says there 's only one way to describe the shooting : as a crime			2
" we want to know the names			0
we want to know who they are			0
... those who killed him , because they are criminals , " grandmother @entity36 said			1
in addition to demanding a jury trial , the lawsuit also seeks punitive damages and a declaration that the @entity11 agents violated the @entity45			1
at the time of the shooting , the @entity12 @entity11 said agents in @entity49 , @entity50 , opened fire after people on the @entity5 side hurled rocks their way			1
tuesday 's lawsuit , filed by the @entity9 on behalf of @entity19 's mother , describes the 16 - year - old as an innocent bystander , calling his killing " brazen and lawless			1
" " just prior to the shooting , @entity2 was visible and not hiding ; an observer could see that he did not pose a threat			1
he was doing nothing but peacefully walking down the street by himself when he was gunned down , " the lawsuit says			0
" he was not committing a crime , nor was he throwing rocks , using a weapon , or in any way threatening @entity12 @entity11 agents or anyone else			1
" an autopsy report from the state attorney general 's office in @entity76 , @entity5 , last year said @entity19 was shot at least 10 times			2
most of the bullets hit him in the back , according to the report			0
the teen , according to the lawsuit , was walking on a sidewalk along the border -- just a few blocks from his home in @entity49 , @entity76 -- when he was shot dead by the @entity11			1
attorney @entity88 told @entity0 the lawsuit is the family 's only recourse			2
" there is no other way in which the family can seek justice			0
there is no other alternative			0
... what happened was an egregious act of violence and it should never happen again , " he said			0
@entity11 spokesman @entity11 declined to comment to @entity0 en @entity103 on tuesday , saying the agency does not comment on pending litigation			2
the lawsuit is the latest twist in a case that drew sharp condemnation from the @entity5 @entity110 and caught the attention of the @entity113 ' top human rights official			0
@entity114 , a lawyer for the @entity9 , said there 's a key question with national importance at the heart of the case : " can a @entity12 @entity11 agent shoot into @entity5 and kill a @entity5 national and say that the @entity12 @entity45 does n't protect you ? " @entity11 : smugglers spotted before shooting citing preliminary reports of the 2012 shooting , the @entity11 said at the time that agents saw smugglers drop drugs on the @entity12 side of the border in @entity49 , @entity50 , then return to @entity5			1
" subjects at the scene then began assaulting the agents with rocks , " the @entity11 said in a written statement at the time			1
" after verbal commands from agents to cease were ignored , one agent then discharged his service firearm , " the @entity11 said			2
" one of the subjects appeared to have been hit			0
" after the shooting , @entity5 's @entity110 argued that it was the latest in a series of cases that showed @entity12 border patrol agents were unnecessarily -- and unjustly -- using deadly force			0
@entity113 @entity147 @entity146 said in 2012 that the @entity12 was using excessive force along the border			0
" there have been very many , many , young people , teenagers , who have been killed at the border , " @entity146 said then , calling for a swift , transparent investigation			0
in may , @entity155 said it was changing its use of force policies , requiring more training and increased transparency			0
the @entity11 has not released the results of its own investigation into the october 2012 case , nor the names of the agents involved			0
@entity9 : @entity12 agents have ' systemic problems of abuse ' in addition to allegations about the october 2012 shooting , tuesday 's lawsuit also alleges that @entity12 @entity11 agents have " systemic problems of abuse			1
" " @entity11 consistently denies public access to basic information about its operations , including whether agents responsible for abuse are disciplined in any way , thus shielding the agency and individual agents from public accountability for abusive policies and practices , " the lawsuit says			1
" even after many fatal shooting incidents involving @entity11 agents , the agency has refused to release the names of those involved			1
" the lawsuit alleges that @entity11 agents caused 46 deaths nationwide from 2005 to 2014 , citing media reports and government data			1
a report by the @entity194 released by @entity155 in may said investigators had reviewed 25 cases from january 2010 to october 2012 that involved shots fired by @entity11 agents who were attacked by rocks			2
the report did not provide details about the october 2012 incident			0
" some cases seemed to be a clear - cut self - defense reaction to close and serious rock threats or assaults , while other shootings were of more questionable justification , " the report says			0
" more questionable cases , " according to the report , involved shootings that took place through the border fence " at subjects who were throwing rocks at agents from @entity5			0
" @entity5 condemns @entity11 's lethal force against migrant journalist @entity220 and @entity0 's @entity221 and @entity222 contributed to this report .			2

@entity9 : shooting @entity2 was " brazen and lawless "
