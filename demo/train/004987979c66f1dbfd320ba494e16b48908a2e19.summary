@entity0 -- @entity2 had tuition and living expenses to pay when he arrived in the @entity5 from @entity6 to attend college			2
so he started a side business , asking family and friends back home to ship him foreign editions of textbooks that often can be bought more cheaply overseas			1
@entity2 resold them online and made money , but he was sued for copyright infringement and lost			1
that decision was appealed and the case is now before the @entity19 , which will hear arguments on monday in a dispute that has attracted interest from the @entity24 administration , media and publishing companies , and a range of consumer and retail groups			1
competing claims of intellectual property and owners rights in the electronic age have made @entity2 's venture one of the most closely watched business cases at the high court this term			1
" i have to say the @entity19 is faced with a really difficult job here because the text of the [ copyright ] statute really seems to be hard to reconcile -- the two provisions at issue seem to say opposite things , " said @entity38 , a professor at @entity40 's law school and an intellectual property expert			1
corporate giants to yard sales the legal issue is whether copyrighted works made and purchased abroad can then be bought and sold within the @entity5 without the copyright owner 's permission			1
yet the stakes could prove enormous for those who buy and sell books , movies , music , artwork , perhaps even furniture , electronics , automobiles , and clothing -- anything that may be considered " intellectual property			1
" storefront and at - home secondary retailers , libraries , artistic venues , even the local garage sale could be implicated			0
@entity2 came to the @entity5 to study mathematics in 1997 at @entity73 and later at the @entity74 for doctoral studies			0
using the computer tag @entity76 , he sold the imported books online in the @entity5 on @entity79			1
court records show he earned about $ 1.2 million in revenue , but both sides disagree over how much profit he made			0
specifically he sold dozens of copies of eight textbooks printed in @entity86 by a subsidiary of @entity89 publishers			0
@entity2 's lawyers claim his gross revenue from the @entity89 sales was just $ 37,000			0
the company sued and a federal jury found @entity2 's conduct was willful and ordered him to pay $ 600,000 in damages			0
the @entity98 publisher has a thriving overseas business			1
its foreign editions typically have a disclaimer : " this book is authorized for sale in @entity105 , @entity86 , @entity106 and the @entity107 only and may not be exported			0
exportation from or importation of this book to another region without the publisher 's authorization is illegal			0
" the high court will consider the limits of two key interpretations of copyright law -- the " first sale doctrine " and its complex relationship to foreign distribution rights			1
the arcane language can be dense but the justices are expected to use their questioning at the oral argument to zero in on competing principles and whether one overrides the other			1
the first - sale doctrine generally gives copyright holders the ability to profit only from the original sale			1
it essentially means once you the consumer lawfully buy a @entity135 lithograph or an @entity137 music cd in the @entity5 , you then can sell that copyrighted work in the @entity5 without punishment and without having to compensate the original copyright holder			1
it ensures a distribution chain of retail items , library lending , gift giving , and rentals for a range of intellectual property			0
that stream of commerce includes secondary markets like flea markets and online resellers @entity154 and @entity79			0
' you bought it , you own it ' the idea -- upheld by the @entity19 since 1908 -- is that once a copyright holder legally sells a product initially , the ownership claim is then exhausted , giving the buyer the power to resell , destroy , donate , whatever			1
it 's a limited idea -- involving only a buyer 's distribution right , not the power to reproduce that dvd or designer dress for sale			2
" the rule we want the @entity19 to adopt is simple : you bought it , you own it and you can do with it what you please			1
very clear , very clean , very easy , " said @entity177 , a lawyer and executive director of the @entity179 , which is supporting the bookseller			0
" the copyright holders are getting paid , they 're getting paid on the first sale			2
" the tricky part is whether that first - sale doctrine applies to material both manufactured and first purchased outside the @entity5			0
federal law gives that authority to a purchaser 's work " lawfully made under this title			2
" does " this title " apply to any copyrighted work -- whether manufactured all or in part in the @entity5 and around the world ? @entity89 argues it readily sells its products overseas at a cheaper price -- particularly to countries in @entity86 , the @entity107 and @entity201 -- to satisfy an audience that may have less income than in the @entity5 or @entity105			2
" we 're going to help the global economy with this , " said @entity205 , an attorney with @entity206 hired by the publisher			0
" the whole idea of the copyright laws is to provide people with an incentive to create books , movies , or other works of art. if you take away that incentive , you 're not going to have creators out there doing things that give us pleasure or educate us			1
" such differences in worldwide prices are often exploited by retail and resale firms , especially on high - end luxury and specialized items			2
known as parallel sales or the " gray market " -- foreign - made goods obtained through secondhand sources -- the strategy costs manufacturers tens of billions of dollars a year , according to some business - generated estimates			1
@entity239 will argue a 1978 congressional law gives publishers protection when they sell their works at differing prices in foreign markets , preventing their importation and resale into the @entity5			1
a federal appeals court in @entity249 agreed , ruling last year such " gray market " items are not subject to the first - sale mandate			0
the high court already has ruled in prior cases that copyright holders can not block @entity5 - made goods sent overseas from later being brought back into the @entity5 for resale			1
the issue now is whether copyright laws apply to foreign - made goods imported into the @entity5 market			1
slippery slope ? but @entity2 and his owners rights supporters worry a slippery slope would quickly occur on a variety of fronts , if they lose at the @entity19 : -- domestic manufacturers would have financial incentive to shut down @entity5 plants and produce everything overseas , since they could get a monetary cut and distribution control over every resale			1
@entity2 's lawyers say that amounts to double - dipping , with copyright holders getting paid twice for the same item 's sale			2
-- libraries would have to either purge their stacks of every foreign - printed work , pay a royalty , or essentially go out of the public lending service			0
-- @entity5 consumers would lose access to affordable and differentiated goods , and charitable donations would be stifled			2
-- with a global consumer economy now dominated by digital and cloud - based access and transfer of information and entertainment , the cross-border lines would create chaos and uncertainty when it comes to determining where a particular copyrighted good is manufactured and then resold			2
@entity89 , with the @entity300 in support , dismiss those scenarios , and say @entity303 would be in a position to ensure libraries in particular do not suffer from any high court ruling against them			2
the entertainment industry says a ruling in their favor is vital in the digital economy to ensure they can divide their property and distribution rights across those global markets			0
as for @entity2 , he is a professor back in @entity6 and never responded to @entity1 's efforts for an interview			0
he initially testified receiving advice from friends back home and also consulting " @entity320 , " an online research help service to ensure he could legally resell the foreign editions in the @entity5			0
in court papers , he also stated being unable to afford paying the hefty , pending judgment against him			0
the man 's lawyers say after the initial verdict , he was ordered to give the publisher his golf clubs and computer in partial compensation			0
the case is @entity2 v. @entity89 ( 11 - 697 )			2
a ruling is expected in coming months			0
@entity1 's @entity334 and @entity335 contributed to this report .			0

case involving student who resold books bought overseas is a major copyright test
@entity19 will consider competing views of law at oral arguments on monday
copyright appeal is one of the most closely watched business cases this term
stakes could be high for those who buy and sell books , movies , music , art , other goods
