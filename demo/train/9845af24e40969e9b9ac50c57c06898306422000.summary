-- a single hair that shows evidence of decomposition was similar to that of @entity5 's 2 - year - old daughter , @entity5 , an @entity7 evidence analyst testified at the @entity8 , @entity9 , woman 's trial saturday			1
investigators found the hair in the trunk of @entity5 's car			1
prosecutors are trying to link the hair to @entity5 as evidence that her body was in the car			1
but defense attorney @entity21 attacked @entity7 trace evidence examiner @entity23 's findings as little more than unreliable opinion in a morning of fitful testimony that produced frequent objections and huddles among the attorneys out of earshot of the jury			1
a crime scene investigator , the operator of a towing company and members of @entity36 's family all have testified they smelled a bad odor coming from @entity36 's car after it was found abandoned in a parking lot on june 27 , 2008 , then towed four days later			1
@entity5 was last reported seen by her family on june 16 , 2008 , but no one alerted police until july 15 , 2008 -- after the girl 's grandmother tracked @entity36 down and demanded answers			1
@entity5 's skeletal remains were found in december 2008			1
@entity36 , 25 , is charged with seven counts in @entity5 's death , including first - degree murder , aggravated child abuse and misleading police			1
if convicted , she could face the death penalty			0
prosecutors say she used chloroform on her daughter and then put duct tape on her nose and mouth to suffocate her			0
she has pleaded not guilty and has denied having anything to do with the girl 's disappearance or death			0
the @entity8 woman 's attorneys argue @entity5 drowned in the family pool on june 16 , 2008			1
they say @entity36 and her father panicked and covered up the death			2
@entity36 denied the claim during his testimony last week			2
testimony about the hair marks a departure from the dramatic testimony and evidence of the last nine days , in which friends and acquaintances contradicted @entity36 's claims that she was frantically searching for her daughter during the month she was missing			1
instead , according to evidence and testimony in the case , she was spending time with her boyfriend , shopping and going to nightclubs			0
in dry , scientific terms , @entity7 trace evidence analyst @entity23 testified saturday how a 9 - inch piece of hair sent to the @entity7 lab in @entity89 , @entity90 , appeared similar to a piece of hair recovered from a brush belonging to the girl			1
but she said hair analysis is not as precise as dna analysis , so she could not say with absolute certainty that the hair belonged to the girl			0
the hair had a dark band that @entity102 testified has only been seen in hairs remaining in the scalp of a decomposing body			0
a crime scene investigator , @entity106 , testified friday that he recovered a human hair from the trunk of @entity36 's car , and also that the car smelled of decomposition			1
in cross-examination , @entity21 questioned the validity of @entity102 's testimony , first asking if there was any way to prove how the hair got into the trunk			2
" i could n't say how the hair got there , " @entity102 said			2
" it 's consistent with transfer or contact of some sort , but i do n't know from whom			2
" she also testified under questioning from @entity21 that while the hair is clearly not @entity5 's , it could belong to any other light - haired relative on her mother 's side of the family			1
the kind of dna testing authorities were able to perform on the sample reveals @entity137 passed down only through maternal lines			0
@entity102 also testified there are no standards for identifying the bands and that such decisions are based on her opinion and that of a fellow investigator			0
@entity21 also questioned @entity102 's experience , saying she had failed a 2000 proficiency test and that she has never before testified on hair banding			2
he also questioned the entire premise of hair analysis , citing a 2009 @entity154 report that broadly questioned the use of microscopic hair analysis and other forensic science results in criminal cases			0
@entity102 said she agreed with the report 's findings -- that hair ca n't uniquely identify an individual and that it 's important to send samples for dna analysis , which she said she did in the @entity36 case			1
@entity102 , who is not a @entity137 expert , has not testified about the findings of the those tests			0
the hair in question was recovered after @entity36 's car was picked up from her family 's home , after it had been abandoned in a parking lot , towed to an impound lot and then driven back to the family home two weeks later by @entity36 's father			1
according to testimony , @entity36 asked her boyfriend to pick her up from the parking lot on june 27 , saying the car had run out of gas			1
she also told a friend that she believed an animal carcass was lodged in her car 's frame			2
the car was towed to an impound lot on june 30 , 2008 , where a manager said he also smelled the odor of decomposition			1
an analysis of the car after the @entity201 took possession of it did not show any such evidence , @entity106 testified			0
also on saturday , @entity206 crime scene investigator @entity205 told jurors about collecting air samples from inside @entity36 's car			1
a scientist later found evidence of chloroform and gases associated with decomposition in those samples			0
@entity21 questioned whether the air inside the trunk on august 29 , 2008 , when it was tested , was the same as that in the car when it was recovered in july			2
he also sought to raise a question whether a trash bag found in the car when it was recovered might have been the source of the smell			0
@entity205 also sampled air from the inside of that bag			0
the contents of the bag were dry when @entity205 tested the air inside , he testified			0
the trash might have smelled different when , and if , it was wet , @entity205 said under questioning from @entity21			0
before prosecutors began presenting scientific evidence in the case on friday , jurors watched recordings of jailhouse visits between @entity36 and her parents			1
in one conversation played friday , @entity36 scoffed at a media report her mother brought up speculating that @entity5 had drowned in the family swimming pool			1
" @entity250 , " @entity36 said of the rumor , which is now the primary defense theory in her capital murder trial in @entity8			1
in recordings of visits played for the jury , @entity36 frequently accused the media of failing to accurately report on the case			1
a videotaped exchange , during which @entity36 became agitated with her parents as they pressed her for details of @entity5 's whereabouts , was one in a series shown to jurors the past two days			1
" we need to have something to go on , " @entity5 pleaded during the visit			2
" @entity267 , i 'm sorry			0
i do n't have anything , " @entity5 angrily replied			1
" i 've been here a month			0
do you understand how i feel ? " some legal experts say these taped conversations could hurt @entity36 in the eyes of jurors			2
" these tapes are so devastating to the defense , " defense attorney @entity274 told @entity276 's @entity275			0
" now at this point , there is no way @entity5 can take the stand in the case			2
they can not get an acquittal			0
" prosecutors allege @entity36 was not looking for her daughter during the month she was missing			1
instead , she was staying with her boyfriend , spending time in @entity8 with numerous friends , attending parties , going shopping and hitting nightclubs , including participating in a " hot body " contest , according to evidence in the case			0
her former boyfriend , friends and acquaintances have all testified that she did not mention her daughter being missing during that time and that they noticed nothing different about her demeanor			0
@entity36 's defense team explains her behavior in the weeks following @entity5 's death by saying she had been sexually abused by her father and had been taught to conceal her pain			1
@entity36 has denied abusing his daughter			2
the trial will resume monday morning			2
prosecutors expect their case will take two more weeks , after which @entity21 will begin to mount the defense case			0
overall , the trial is likely to last another four to six weeks , based on initial projections			0
watch @entity275 monday through sunday starting at 8 p.m. et on @entity276			0
