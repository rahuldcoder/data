-- @entity1 , the biggest consumer of cotton , has lodged a formal protest against @entity6 's ban on cotton exports amid signs that @entity6 is rethinking the ban that was implemented a few days ago			1
@entity10 , @entity6 's prime minister , urgently requested a group of cabinet members to review the ban after the country 's agriculture minister said that the curbs on the fibre would hurt farmers			1
the outcome of the review would be made public today , a statement from the prime minister 's office said			2
an official in the prime minister 's office said cabinet members were likely to lift the ban			1
" there is a realistic , high chance that the ban will be lifted , " the official told the @entity0			0
the u-turn is , however , not certain as @entity31 balances its relationship with @entity33 and the interests of its farmers with the concerns of its powerful textile industry			0
the abrupt policy changes are adding further volatility to the cotton market after two years of sharp swings in prices			0
@entity44 rose to an all - time high of more than $ 2 a pound last year amid a shortage in part created by an export ban by @entity6 , only to fall afterwards to less than $ 1 after cotton mills defaulted on contracts			1
@entity44 traders including @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 suffered big losses as a result			1
@entity44 prices have risen this year after @entity6 banned exports for the second time in two years			1
@entity6 , the second - largest producer of cotton , instituted the ban with immediate effect on march 5 , in a move aimed at ensuring sufficient supply of cotton for domestic textile companies			0
@entity6 's move came after @entity1 had aggressively bought bales over the past year for a government reserve as a way of supporting domestic farm prices and buffering against price volatility			2
by late january , @entity1 had bought as many as 5m bales of foreign cotton for the reserve which , along with its domestic purchases , made up 15 per cent of global cotton consumption in the current crop year , the @entity76 @entity75 estimated			0
this week , @entity83 , agriculture minister , wrote to the prime minister the day after the ban demanding that export of the fibre be allowed			2
he complained that due to higher production this year , farmers were already suffering from lower prices than they had expected and needed to export to recover their domestic losses			0
however , @entity6 's commerce ministry , which enforced the ban , said domestic textile companies had been complaining that they were finding it hard to compete with rivals in @entity95 and @entity96 because of rising cotton prices in @entity6			1
the trade regulator 's move is expected to push down cotton prices in the country			2
@entity44 for may delivery was up 0.9 per cent to 90.90 cents a pound on @entity105 's @entity104 exchange			0
futures peaked earlier this week at 94 cents			0
