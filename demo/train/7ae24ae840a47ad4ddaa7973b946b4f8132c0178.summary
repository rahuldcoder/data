-- quick : which @entity3 president has authorized wars of various kinds in seven @entity7 countries ? if you guessed @entity9 , you are correct			1
many did not think it would turn out this way			0
early on in his presidency , on june 4 , 2009 , @entity9 delivered a widely anticipated speech in the @entity15 capital , @entity16 , which was billed as the start of a " reset " with the @entity7 world			1
president @entity19 was , of course , widely reviled among @entity21 for his invasion of @entity23 and the prisons at @entity25 and @entity26			1
many @entity21 hoped that the first @entity28 - @entity3 president , who had opposed the @entity29 as a candidate , would be quite different than his predecessor			2
in @entity16 , @entity9 declared , " i have come here to seek a new beginning between the @entity3 and @entity21 around the world ; one based upon mutual interest and mutual respect ; and one based upon the truth that @entity37 and @entity7 are not exclusive , and need not be in competition			1
" crucially , @entity9 also said in the @entity16 speech : " we will , however , relentlessly confront violent extremists who pose a grave threat to our security			2
because we reject the same thing that people of all faiths reject : the killing of innocent men , women and children			0
and it is my first duty as president to protect the @entity3 people			0
" those who listened to the president 's speech mostly heard that he was extending an olive branch to the @entity7 world and largely ignored the fact that during the same speech he had also made a rather robust defense of the @entity3 war on @entity65 and its allies			1
a similar dissonance happened a few months later when the president went to @entity69 to accept the @entity70			0
the jurors who awarded the prize ( and many who voted for him in 2008 ) seemed to have conflated @entity9 's opposition to the @entity23 war with his presumed opposition to war in general			1
the president was surely the first recipient of the @entity70 to use the opportunity provided by his acceptance speech in @entity82 to explain his philosophy of just and necessary wars			2
at @entity82 , @entity9 said , " i face the world as it is , and can not stand idle in the face of threats to the @entity3 people			1
for make no mistake : @entity89 does exist in the world			0
a nonviolent movement could not have halted @entity93 's armies			0
negotiations can not convince @entity65 's leaders to lay down their arms			0
to say that force is sometimes necessary is not a call to cynicism ; it is recognition of history , the imperfections of man , and the limits of reason			0
" as it turned out , @entity9 was one of the most militarily aggressive @entity3 presidents in decades , authorizing military operations of various kinds in seven @entity7 countries : @entity111 , @entity23 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and , now , @entity116			1
the bombing of @entity116 is the first time the @entity3 has mounted a full - scale war since @entity120 without any one of the following -- a @entity122 resolution authorizing force			1
-- as part of a @entity126 operation			0
-- an @entity128 resolution in favor of military action			2
-- a specific @entity3 congressional authorization for war in another country			0
-- the invitation of the host country to conduct military operations as we have recently seen in @entity23 , where the @entity23 government has been begging for @entity3 military intervention			2
do the thought experiment where @entity19 had gone to war in another @entity143 country without the cover of a @entity122 resolution , or of a @entity126 operation , or of @entity128 approval , or of a specific congressional authorization			1
the howls of protest from @entity3 liberals and the @entity7 world would surely have been deafening			1
instead there have been no protests			0
that 's partly because of the adept manner with which the @entity9 administration assembled a @entity159 coalition of the willing -- @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , the @entity163 and @entity164 â € ” to help with the airstrikes			1
how @entity9 came to launch strikes in @entity116 but it partly must be something to do with the fact that so many of his critics , and even his supporters , regard @entity9 as some kind of peacenik			1
in fact his record shows him to be anything but : consider that he mandated a threefold increase in the number of @entity3 troops in @entity111 , from 30,000 soldiers at the end of the @entity19 administration to 90,000 , a surge of troops that played a critical role in blunting the @entity187 's momentum , which had gathered strength in the final years of @entity19 's second term			0
consider that under @entity19 there were 48 @entity192 drone strikes in @entity113			0
under @entity9 there have been 328 , which have killed some two - dozen @entity65 commanders , according to a count by @entity37			0
consider that under @entity19 there was only one @entity192 drone strike in @entity115			0
under @entity9 there have been 99 drone strikes and 15 airstrikes , which have killed more than three - dozen of the group 's senior operatives there			2
@entity9 is also the first @entity3 president to authorize the assassination of a @entity3 citizen , the @entity208 - born @entity65 operational commander @entity207 , who was killed in @entity115 in a drone strike in 2011			2
the same year @entity9 initiated the alliance that overthrew the @entity112 dictator , @entity212			0
@entity9 has also waged an effective covert war in @entity114 against the @entity65 affiliate based there , @entity215 , whose leader , @entity216 , was killed in a @entity3 airstrike earlier this month			2
and @entity9 , of course , also authorized the risky @entity220 mission that killed @entity65 's founder , @entity221 , in 2011 in @entity222 , a city deep inside @entity113			1
this is not the record of someone who is afraid to use @entity3 power , as his critics would have it , but rather a president who is comfortable exercising @entity3 hard power even in a country like @entity116 , where he has launched a war without the kinds of specific international or congressional authorizations other presidents have sought since @entity120			1

@entity237 : president @entity9 has authorized wars in seven @entity7 countries
although he opposed @entity23 war , @entity9 has *n't* been at all *shy* about using force , @entity237 says
@entity9 's *outreach* to @entity7 world , @entity244 may have given *wrong* idea , he says
@entity249 : latest war in @entity116 launched without support from @entity122 or @entity128
