" this is where it all started , " says @entity1 , gazing out over a sandy shoreline lapped by dying breakers			1
almost 40 years old , @entity1 is one of @entity6 's surfing pioneers			1
picking up his first board at the age of eight , he 's now a professional surfer , owner of multiple surf shops and president of a clothing company , @entity12 / @entity6			1
we 're standing on @entity14 , a five kilometer stretch of white sand that 's one of the most popular tourist areas on the @entity20 island of @entity6			1
once a small fisherman 's village , today 's @entity14 is anything but quiet			0
large commercial airplanes cruising into @entity25 fly over the heads of surfers			0
beach loungers are scattered down the shore as far as the eye can see , fighting for space with the multiple surf schools catering to tourists with " @entity35 " dreams			0
@entity1 walks us over to a little hut on the beach where we meet made @entity39 , a surf shop owner , painter and leisure surfer who also grew up in @entity14			1
" he 's the one , the first generation , the first kid from the fisherman village to surf , " says @entity1			1
@entity39 , tanned from all those hours in the water , sits with one leg propped up as he fiddles with his fishing pole			0
" i started surfing from a fisherman boat			0
they had wood from a chair , so i started kind of boogie boarding with that and then found a few boards left from @entity59 , " @entity51 says			0
@entity6 a late arrival to global surf scene @entity39 and @entity1 are part of the breakthrough generation of @entity20 surfers			1
despite @entity6 being an obvious surf paradise , with its consistent waves and welcoming warm water , it was n't until the late 1960s and 70s that it made its way onto the global surfing map			1
@entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 were the three big players			0
but with the 1971 documentary " @entity77 , " @entity6 finally got its recognition , as scenes of @entity81 's barreling waves caused surfers around the world to grip their wax in excitement			1
with that recognition , @entity20 surfers eventually moved into the sport -- but not before overcoming some cultural taboos			1
" @entity20 believe that the ocean is very , very dangerous and the sea god is going to take you away , " explains @entity1			1
many kids of his generation grew up not knowing how to swim , he says			0
even today , some fisherman still ca n't			0
@entity1 and @entity39 were viewed as rebels when they began surfing , ignoring their family 's objections and defying any fear , he says			2
today , that societal unease is slipping away and fishermen see surfing as a business opportunity			0
using their boats to take surfers out to further breaks inaccessible from the shore -- such as a popular set of reef waves near @entity14 's airport runway -- has led families to accept that surfing can pay the bills			2
@entity112 , a surf photographer based in @entity6 , has seen the evolution of surfing culture here			1
" life 's too good and they know it , " he says			0
" they surf with the best surfers on the best waves on a daily basis			2
" though @entity20 surfers have been gracing the pages of international surf magazines for about a decade , @entity112 believes it takes a certain fire in their bellies to get out of their comfort zone and to the next level			1
@entity128 ca n't recall the first time he photographed @entity1 , but believes it must have been when he was about 16 years old			2
he points out that @entity1 is not balinese but @entity131 , so it 's been even harder for him to be accepted into the local surf scene here			1
" it 's made him have to work harder			0
" and it 's paid off , with @entity1 paving the way for future surfers			1
will a @entity139 surfer ever top the podium ? nowadays , hardcore surfers head for @entity142 in @entity6 's southern @entity81 area			1
filled with high - speed waves , it has some of the best -- and most dangerous -- surf in @entity6			2
just to the left of the rock enclosed beach are those world - famous barrels			0
@entity1 has taken us here for a practice session leading up to the big annual @entity154 tournament , which he 's been chasing every year since its inception in 2004			2
in tow is @entity1 's son , @entity157 , a name which means " god of the sea			2
" @entity157 and his friends beg to go out and try the big barrels			0
the boy finally gets his wish and paddles out side by side with @entity1 , even getting to catch a few waves in between world - renowned pros like @entity170			2
@entity112 figures this new generation of balinese surfers -- boys and girls -- is the best yet to come out of @entity6 , but it still could be another 20 to 30 years before a @entity139 tops the surfing world			1
but they 'll find their way there with style and grace , he says			0
" it 's not very often you see an ugly @entity139 surfer , " says @entity112			1
" if you could build a surfer , the @entity185 are close to perfect			0
they can jump to their feet effortlessly			0
they 're beautiful to watch			0
