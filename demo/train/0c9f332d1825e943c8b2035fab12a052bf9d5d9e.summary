-- as the fallout continues from the release of thousands of diplomatic cables on the @entity7 website , @entity2 's prime minister is threatening to file a lawsuit over comments made about him in one of the messages by the @entity14 ambassador to his country			1
@entity16 says he plans to sue over remarks from then - ambassador @entity18 in 2004 suggesting that the prime minister concealed his wealth in @entity22 bank accounts			1
visibly angry , @entity16 told an audience in @entity24 , @entity2 , wednesday that he wanted the @entity14 administration to take action against the diplomats who had " slandered " him			1
" the @entity14 should ask its diplomats to make an explanation because no diplomat can accuse a country with slanders and misinterpretations , " he said			0
" this is the @entity14 ' problem , not ours ... those who have slandered us will be crushed under these claims , will be finished and will disappear , " @entity16 said later , according to @entity2 media reports			1
in a cable dated december 12 , 2004 , the @entity14 ambassador in @entity24 at the time wrote a less - than - flattering profile of @entity16 , who had recently become prime minister amid anxiety among @entity47 governments about his " @entity49 tendencies			1
" the note sent to @entity51 by @entity18 said the new prime minister 's " hunger for power reveals itself in a sharp authoritarian style and deep distrust of others			2
" @entity16 's advisors were characterized as " sycophantic ( but contemptuous ) " in the missive			0
the cable also spoke of the prime minister 's " susceptibility to @entity49 theories			2
" " he indulges in pronounced pro-sunni prejudices and in emotional reactions that prevent the development of coherent , practical domestic or foreign policies , " the cable added			0
@entity0 calls to @entity18 for comment were not immediately returned			0
the cable then discussed the alleged bank accounts			0
while apparently offering no evidence they existed , it continued : " we have heard from two contacts that @entity16 has eight accounts in @entity22 banks ; his explanations that his wealth comes from the wedding presents guests gave his son and that a @entity2 businessman is paying the educational expenses of all four @entity16 children in the @entity14 purely altruistically are lame			1
" @entity16 vowed to resign if it could be shown he had bank accounts in @entity22			2
" i do n't have a @entity91 's penny in @entity22 banks to prove			0
now , i am telling the leader of the opposition and others , if such a thing would be proven , i would not stay in this position , i would not remain a parliamentarian			0

@entity16 calls on the @entity14 to take action against those who " slandered " him
