@entity0 -- senate majority leader @entity2 said tuesday he 's not sure a potential government shutdown at the end of the month can be avoided because of a stand - off between the @entity6 and @entity7 over how much to spend on disaster relief			1
" i heard reports that @entity13 ( @entity12 said there will be no shutdown , " @entity2 told reporters in the @entity10			2
" i 'm not that sure			0
i 'm not that sure because the @entity16 - driven @entity6 has been so unreasonable in the past			1
i do n't know why they should suddenly be reasonable			0
" at issue is a short - term bill to fund government agencies through november 18 that the @entity22 - controlled @entity6 will vote on wednesday			1
it allocates fewer resources to the @entity25 and the @entity26 for disaster response than the @entity28 - led @entity7 approved last week			1
additional funds are needed because recent major floods from @entity31 along the @entity32 and wildfires in @entity34 exceeded the amount these agencies have left in their coffers to support recovery and rebuilding efforts			0
both the @entity6 and @entity7 are scheduled to take a weeklong recess next week and the current government funding expires september 30			1
the @entity22 measure includes a total of $ 3.6 billion -- $ 1 billion in emergency funds available when the bill is enacted and another $ 2.6 billion to be budgeted for those federal response agencies for the 2012 fiscal year			0
the @entity7 bill that passed with bipartisan support last week includes $ 6.9 billion for @entity25 and other federal agencies for immediate disaster relief and for relief in 2012			1
earlier this month , president @entity53 asked @entity54 for a total of $ 5.1 billion in additional disaster aid â € ” $ 500 million of which was for immediate relief			2
in addition to the disagreement over how much money these agencies should get , @entity6 @entity22 leaders are insisting that the $ 1 billion in their bill that those agencies would get right away to cover recovery costs be offset with $ 1.5 billion in cuts to a loan program that helps automakers retool their operations to make more fuel - efficient cars			1
earlier tuesday , @entity2 announced that if the @entity6 passes its stopgap - spending bill , the @entity7 will add the higher amount -- $ 6.9 billion -- it passed for disaster relief to that bill and send it back to the @entity6 , in an attempt to force the @entity6 @entity22 to accept the higher level			1
@entity2 's tough stand comes partly because he feels emboldened after 10 @entity79 , mostly from disaster - hit states , voted with the @entity28 last week to approve that aid			2
however , @entity6 majority leader @entity82 made it clear the @entity22 wo n't budge , and accused the @entity28 of using the issue for political gain			2
" it 'll be on leader @entity2 's shoulders because he 's the one playing politics with it			0
no one wants to stand in the way of disaster relief money that is needed			1
there is nothing else but politics going on with that move , if that 's what happens , " @entity82 told reporters tuesday			0
@entity2 accused @entity6 @entity79 of " pettiness " in their allocation of disaster relief and said it would be " illogical " to expect the @entity7 to go along with it or to accept the blame if the government shuts down			1
despite the sound and fury between @entity2 and @entity82 , @entity104 expressed some optimism that a deal will be struck			0
" there wo n't be a government shutdown , " he said			0
" the @entity54 always responds appropriately to disasters			0
we 're having a discussion about the appropriate way to do that and i 'm confident it will be resolved			0
" the @entity6 @entity22 spending bill keeps federal agencies funded at the rate set in the debt deal enacted last month			2
earlier this year @entity54 averted a government shutdown at the 11th hour when @entity6 speaker @entity122 and @entity2 negotiated a compromise on overall spending levels			2
many on @entity126 believed a similar showdown would be avoided this fall because the debt deal already established how much would be cut			0
but this battle over disaster aid revives the possibility of a shutdown			2
a group of close to 70 @entity6 @entity28 sent a letter to @entity6 @entity22 leaders urging them to bring up the @entity7 measure without any spending offsets for the @entity25 money in it			1
" the families that remain without homes in shelters are not interested in seeing more gridlock in @entity0			0
the farmers who lost their crops and livestock do not care about debates over deficits and offsets			0
the entrepreneurs who lost their small businesses can not afford to see us play politics , " the letter states			0
but @entity6 @entity22 whip rep @entity158 , @entity160 , predicted tuesday the @entity7 bill would n't pass in the @entity6			1
" if @entity2 does what he does , i do n't see the votes on the floor			0
" the top @entity165 on the @entity166 , rep @entity167 , @entity169 , said last week he objects to the practice of offsetting emergency money for natural disaster , but said he would support the bill because he wants to avoid a potential shutdown			2
but the @entity28 ' vote - counter in the @entity6 , rep @entity176 , @entity178 , predicted the @entity22 plan to offset additional disaster aid wo n't get much @entity28 support , " i think @entity28 will be loath to support that effort , because we think it 's counterproductive			1
" @entity176 maintained that cutting the loan program run by the @entity190 by $ 1.5 billion " puts at risk some 30,000 to 50,000 jobs that would be created we believe by that investment			0
" in addition to the fight over the disaster money , @entity6 @entity22 leaders are also dealing with a rebellion from a group of about 50 @entity6 conservatives who oppose the spending measure because the overall funding level is $ 24 billion above the level @entity199 included in the 2012 budget they passed earlier this year			1
despite the blowback on both sides of the aisle , @entity82 predicted the @entity6 would pass the spending bill when it comes up for a vote on wednesday			1
@entity122 declined to answer a question tuesday about whether he was worried about @entity54 heading for a shutdown			0
but his spokesman @entity210 continued to press for the @entity7 to accept the @entity6 bill , saying , " we believe the best approach is for the @entity7 to pass the @entity6 ( measure ) to ensure we get disaster relief to those affected communities as quickly as possible			1

@entity25 , @entity26 would get more money from @entity7
@entity6 wants some disaster relief funding to be offset by cuts
