@entity0 , @entity1 -- coach @entity4 's worried pacing along the sidelines of a recent game does n't even begin to tell the story inside his mind			1
but the wound over his right eye gives you a sense of his pain inside , two weeks after he was caught in the middle of a post-game melee that sent him to a hospital			1
some say he was intentionally targeted by the other team			1
others say it was trash talking run amok -- including a text message by a coach -- all set against a raging high school football rivalry in rural @entity1			1
either way , a lifelong high school football coach now has bolts holding together his eye socket after it was shattered by a player 's football helmet			1
" it was like if you had crushed up cornflakes , that 's what all this bone looked like , " @entity4 said , motioning to his right eye			2
on the night of october 14 , @entity4 's team , the @entity38 of @entity39 , defeated the @entity41 of nearby @entity42			1
as the @entity38 returned to the visiting team 's locker room , they found the door locked			1
while waiting for a helper on their team to return with the key , the losing home team walked by , on the way to their locker room , and that 's when it all began			1
no one seems to know who or what started the incident , but officials from both schools say both teams threw and swung helmets			2
" it only took one to get the brawl started			2
someone did not make the right decision , " @entity66 superintendent @entity65 said			2
" whether it came from our side , or @entity39 's side , i do not know			2
" @entity39 schools superintendent @entity73 said it was hard to tell what was going on because so many people were involved			2
" we just saw this sea of people , and it was moving like waves , " @entity73 said			2
" then all of a sudden , we saw a helmet go up			2
" during the melee , sheriff 's deputies pepper sprayed the players , and a player from each team suffered a concussion			1
after the incident was broken up , no arrests were made			2
@entity4 says he was struck in the head with a helmet as he tried to intervene			0
he does n't remember much about the incident			0
he lost a tear duct , and it 's possible that he may need more surgery			0
" it just makes no sense			0
i do n't understand it , " he said			0
@entity73 , the @entity39 schools superintendent , wants a full investigation to determine if @entity4 was the target of an attack			0
" i 'm not making any judgments right now ... i just have questions about how it could have happened and unfolded like that , " she said			0
" i think using a helmet , to smash somebody 's face in , is using a weapon			0
and we are very lucky the hit did n't move over just a little bit , and we could have had a dead coach			1
" those involved agree that the incident started a week before , with trash talking about the game in the community and on @entity119			0
all of the @entity119 chatter has been pulled off of the site , but school administrators in both counties say it was alive and well in the week leading up to the game			1
" there was talk on @entity119 before this game			1
there was some back and forth on @entity119 , maybe some text messages , " @entity73 said			1
" i 'm sure that if you 're a team and you keep seeing either side trash talk here or there , or back and forth , i 'm sure it gets you riled up inside			1
" the heated exchange also continued after the incident on october 14			1
according to a @entity39 school affidavit , a former coach for the @entity141 who is now a volunteer assistant coach with the @entity143 team sent text messages to his former players following the game , including this one : " better stay yo stupid ass in wc ( @entity39 ) , @entity148 get really hurt			1
" and later that night , another text message , " how th [ e ] [ expletive ] i kno [ w ] about yall bull [ expletive ]			2
@entity156 started this [ expletive ] last week			0
" a few days after the melee , @entity42 sheriff @entity160 called in the @entity162			2
but he told @entity2 that he does not believe that @entity4 was targeted , and he said the locker room 's door was not locked on purpose			0
" it takes time to investigate anywhere from 100 to 120 - some people that has to be investigated , " the sheriff said			0
" this is not something that is done in two days			0
" state law enforcement officials say the investigation could take months			0
" we have no time frame			0
there are too many circumstances beyond our control to get a large number of witnesses to be interviewed , " said @entity175 of the @entity162			0
state law enforcement officials say they 're looking into all aspects of the case including what role social media played in escalating the trash talking			1
the investigation will take place in these two rural northeastern @entity1 counties , about 22 miles apart , both poor farming communities with high unemployment			1
" the kids know each other			0
there are family members on both teams , " said coach @entity194 of @entity143			2
@entity194 is also among those blaming social media for fanning the flames of the two schools ' rivalry			1
" @entity119 kinda keeps everything going			0
... so if i make a comment on @entity119 that it was a great game , somebody may make a comment and say , ' y'all gon na get your butt whooped , ' and they go back and forth , and then , when they see each other , they 've had this long conversation i have no idea about , " he said			0
one school safety expert says that social media chatter and threats have a nationwide ripple effect that is forcing school officials to spend more time , money and energy on school security , at a time when dollars are hard to come by			1
" social media is increasing the communication speed to the point where threats that used to spread in hours and days now spread in minutes and seconds			1
and it 's escalating very quickly , and the violence can escalate along with it , " said @entity234 , a school safety consultant			1
" school administrators now find themselves dealing with things that start at night and at home , that can spread to athletic events			2
" but who threw the first punch in the fight that sent two teenagers and a coach to the hospital ? " i have no idea			1
they say we did , we say they did , " @entity194 said			0
in addition to the social media issue , @entity194 says another part of the problem is peer pressure to retaliate -- whether it 's in person or through social media -- and what 's being taught at home			1
as for @entity4 , as he faces the possibility of more surgery to repair his crushed eye socket , he 's in pain and still has severe headaches			0
" people want me to be hateful , and i ca n't do that			0
i ca n't do that , " he said			0
" i think it all goes back to what 's taking place in their home and who cares about them			0
i 'm not going to paint these kids as different or bad			0

on october 14 , a melee broke out between two @entity1 high school football rivals
one coach , trying to break up the fight , suffered serious injuries
a player from each team suffered a concussion
some say the violence was *fueled* by talk via text messages and social media
