@entity0 , @entity1 -- acknowledging strong public anger and skepticism over the government 's handling of a deadly bullet train collision last weekend , @entity1 premier @entity3 promised a thorough investigation into the accident and its aftermath			1
@entity13 made the pledge on the crash site near @entity0 in eastern @entity17 province , where a bullet train was struck from behind saturday night by another train , killing at least 40 people and injuring almost 200			1
" our investigation has to answer to the people , " @entity13 said after laying a bouquet of flowers at a makeshift memorial on the scene			2
" there will be a thorough probe into the accident , including all relevant aspects from equipment failures , management problems to manufacturing issues			2
" " if corruption is found during the investigation , we will take it seriously and punish those responsible to the fullest extent of the law , " he added			0
earlier the state - run @entity42 news agency quoted the @entity45 railway bureau as saying design flaws in the railway signal equipment led to saturday 's fatal collision			1
before addressing reporters at the crash site , @entity13 met victims ' families and visited injured passengers at a local hospital			0
he said the government must show compassion in dealing with people affected by the tragedy , reminding officials that " money would not bring lost loved ones back			0
" state media tuesday reported that local authorities would offer bonus money to victims ' families who settle early with the government , which has capped the total compensation at 500,000 yuan ( 77,000 @entity68 dollars )			1
local officials later denied the story amid fierce criticisms online			0
@entity1 netizens have also been fuming over the railway ministry 's decision to end search - and - rescue operation after less than six hours , and its move to crush and bury one of the six derailed train cars when the investigation had barely started			1
in a nod to such sentiment , @entity13 said railway officials owed the public an answer while stressing the importance of an open and transparent investigation			2
" the key to the handling of the accident is whether we let people know the truth , " he said			2
" during the process , we should release information to the public timely and accurately			0
" @entity13 , @entity1 's third most senior official after president @entity96 and legislative chief @entity97 , has long been the public face of the top leadership in times of disasters and tragedies			1

the government plans to pour over $ 400 billion into rail projects in the next five years and also wants to export its technologies to markets that include the @entity68			0
the massive investment and rapid construction have long raised public doubts on the new lines ' safety and commercial viability , and last saturday 's accident has only bolstered critics ' arguments			2
" i think the bullet train system is not stable and may break down in extreme weather conditions , " said professor @entity127 , a transportation expert with @entity128			0
" the previous railway minister developed high - speed rail irrationally and unscientifically , and this accident was the consequence of that ' great leap forward ' strategy			1
" @entity13 assured skeptics home and abroad that the government would learn its lessons and do its utmost to restore people 's faith in @entity1 's high - speed rail			1
" if safety is compromised , there is no credibility to speak of , " he said			0
