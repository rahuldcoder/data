-- the @entity1 is in the midst of a historic debate over what role it will play in immigration reform			1
should the @entity1 change course and support a path to citizenship for some 11 million unauthorized immigrants , hoping this will reverse the party 's declining fortunes among @entity13 , the fast - growing group of voters ? or should it double down on its opposition to reform , kill the legislation and hope to hang on by strengthening loyalty among a declining share of white voters ? while all the attention has been focused on what to do about the southern border with @entity26 , @entity1 would be well - advised to take a careful look north			1
in @entity32 , the @entity28 , which lost two of every three elections to the @entity31 during the 20th century , has turned the tables by embracing immigration and reaching out to @entity32 's immigrant communities			1
there is no reason @entity1 can not do the same			1
i lived in @entity32 for many years , as an immigrant from the @entity40 growing up in @entity41 and then as a newspaper reporter for several publications			2
throughout my time in @entity32 , the @entity44 was the party supported by most immigrants			1
under a series of leaders , most notably @entity48 and @entity49 , the @entity31 formed an unbeatable coalition based on @entity52 - speaking voters from @entity53 and the rapidly growing immigrant population in the big cities of @entity56 and @entity41			0
mostly white @entity28 voters from the heartland grumbled and called for more provincial autonomy , but their party was usually relegated to the opposition benches in @entity62			0
under prime minister @entity64 , however , conservatives have turned that landscape upside down			0
in @entity32 's 2011 election , the @entity63 outpolled the @entity31 decisively among voters who were n't born in @entity32 , a historic transformation that was the result of a strategic decision by @entity64 during the 2000s to reach out to @entity32 's immigrant communities			1
the party , which won a minority government in 2006 , made small gestures such as reducing the arrival fee for immigrants , and larger historical ones such asapologizing and compensating descendants for the notorious @entity80 " head tax " levied to discourage @entity80 immigration in the 19th century			2
in the 2011 campaign , conservatives also promised targeted tax cuts for families that appealed to suburban immigrants , recruited more minority candidates than any other party and ran campaign ads in @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and other languages			2
of the 23 seats picked up by the @entity96 , 20 were in the greater @entity56 region and none had an immigrant population of less than 30 %			0
just a decade ago , in the 2000 election , the @entity44 had won more than 60 % of the immigrant vote			0
the 2011 election was no fluke either			0
the @entity28 has increased its share of the overall popular vote in each of the past four elections			0
the chief architect of this shift was an @entity110 bunny named @entity111 , who looks like he walked out of a meeting of the young campus republicans			0
in nearly five years as @entity32 's minister of @entity116 ( yes , that 's " multiculturalism " with a capital m ) , @entity111 has spent almost every weekend in immigrant constituencies attending parties , visiting temples and mosques , and embracing , sometimes literally , thousands of recent immigrants			1
" people from the communities like to touch you , to embrace you , to hug you , and physical contact is n't my strong suit , " he told @entity125 's magazine recently			0
@entity111 has not only embraced immigrant communities , he has championed immigration policy as a tool of @entity32 economic development			1
indeed , if the @entity1 were looking for an actual policy on immigration rather than just saying no to the @entity137 , @entity111 and the @entity63 are creating a more market - driven , decentralized scheme that could be a model for the @entity1			1
under the @entity96 , who won a majority in 2011 , @entity32 is trying to overhaul its immigration system to increase benefits to the @entity32 economy			1
the country 's historic " points system , " in which the government selected immigrants based on a set of broad skills such as education , work experience and language , has not worked very well in choosing immigrants who succeed in the job market			2
so the @entity28 government is creating a new scheme , modeled after successes in @entity159 and @entity160 , in which the credentials and language skills of immigrants will be assessed by an independent third party , and those who pass muster will become part of a pool of potential immigrants to @entity32 that is available to employers			1
but they wo n't get on the plane until they have a job offer			0
the provinces , too , are playing a bigger a role in immigrant selection , unlike the @entity40 states which have no say at all			0
that has gradually shifted new immigrants away from the overcrowded cities to the sparsely populated @entity182 and the @entity183 , where immigration provides a bigger economic boost			0
at a speech to the @entity28 faithful after the 2011 election , @entity111 said the @entity63 had proved it was possible to create " a new durable and diverse @entity28 electorate " based on " values like freedom , enterprise and hard work , personal responsibility , equal opportunity , and respect for law and order , family , faith and tradition			2
" while many in the @entity1 believe a similar message could sell the party to immigrants here , the @entity1 remain focused on not rewarding any of the roughly 11 million immigrants living illegally in the @entity40			1
that led to @entity210 's support for " self - deportation , " which appealed to primary voters but sent immigrants fleeing to the @entity137 in the general election			0
while @entity32 does not have the same illegal immigration problem , the @entity96 did face the same dilemma reaching out to immigrants while holding on to white voters who see @entity32 's immigration system as far too porous			1
the response was to crack down on the refugee admittance scheme , which was rife with fraud , and to tighten immigration rules in other areas as well			0
conservatives showed that toughness on immigration policy could go hand - in - hand with welcoming immigrants			2
while it has been a balancing act , the @entity63 have so far pulled it off brilliantly			2
" @entity32 of all backgrounds are drawn to our party , " @entity111 said , " not in spite of our values , but because of them			1
" that sounds like a slogan for the @entity1 -- if anyone is paying attention			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity243 .			0

@entity243 : @entity1 in the midst of historic debate on immigration reform
republicans can learn from transformation of @entity32 's conservatives on immigration
by adopting *pro-immigrant* views , the @entity63 became a dominant party
