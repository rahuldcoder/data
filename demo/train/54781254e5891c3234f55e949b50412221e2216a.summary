in defiance of @entity2 's law that every action has an equal and opposite reaction , any discussion of legitimate controls on the use , handling and sale of firearms routinely yields an explosive overreaction of opposition			2
i learned that firsthand when i organized a voluntary gun buyback program for january 8 in @entity14 , @entity15			1
it was the tipping point for me to change my party affiliation from @entity19 to @entity20			1
on january 8 in 2011 , a seriously deranged young man murdered six people , including a 9 - year - old girl , and wounded 13 , including rep. @entity24 , during a 45 - second shooting rampage in @entity14			1
he was finally subdued when he stopped to change clips in his semiautomatic weapon , after firing 31 rounds			0
in the immediate aftermath , our community came together as one in our grieving over the deaths and in our resolve to do what we could to prevent a repeat of the tragedy			0
but the irrational fears of the gun lobby succeeded in shouting down the debate , and in the intervening two years not a single piece of meaningful legislation has been adopted that would even begin to solve the problem			1
i was the target of some of that violent overreaction in the two weeks leading up to the buyback			2
thinly veiled threats were leveled at me			0
i was referred to as " @entity51			0
" the response made it clear the event i was planning hit a nerve among a group who evidently believe the proper disposal of a firearm is tantamount to the desecration of a holy icon			0
opinion : a father 's murder , a plea on gun control guns are not fetish objects			2
the buyback was simply an offer to people who were uncomfortable with having a weapon in their homes to trade those weapons into the @entity74 in exchange for a $ 50 grocery gift card			1
more than $ 10,000 in gift cards were distributed during the event			0
the money i used to buy those cards was donated in just under two weeks by @entity14 residents , who still cling to the hope we will re-engage on the topic of rational gun control			1
they showed that the loud voices are not going to shout down the discussion this time around			2
but on the periphery of my buyback , and on the periphery of rational discourse , was a group of gun and @entity97 enthusiasts holding a " cash for guns " firearms flea market			1
they held it on the boundary of the police department parking lot in which my buyback was taking place			2
@entity107 's gun violence measures : would they work ? in @entity15 , it is legal for a person to walk up to another on a street corner , hand him cash for a firearm and simply walk off with it , with no need for a background check into his psychological or criminal history			2
that was exactly what happened with those who came to my buyback to " score some deals " on weapons by outbidding the gift cards i was offering			2
i was a @entity19 at the time , but less than one week after the buyback , i chose to switch parties			1
i believe there is a centrist element among the rank and file in the @entity19 , but the leadership is led by the far right and openly beholden to the @entity97 and the gun lobby			1
it is that rigid ideology that is driving the party into irrelevancy			0
the overreaction to the gun buyback made it clear that , in @entity14 at least , the @entity19 is out of touch with the values of the community			1
the cash for guns event clearly highlighted that anyone , a criminal or someone who is mentally ill , can immediately buy a gun with no questions asked in @entity14			1
it 's obvious that public safety demands that background checks be incorporated somehow in private , person - to - person purchases of guns			0
newspaper removes online data of gun permits that really is low - hanging fruit in the regulation of weapons sales			0
legislators have got to stand up to the gun lobbyists who resist even this minimal change in the law and adopt it -- federally and immediately			0
consider if the @entity14 shooter had needed to change clips after just five rounds had been fired , or even 10			1
the carnage of the day would have been significantly decreased			0
lives would have been saved			0
the size of gun magazines is also low - hanging fruit in this conversation			0
so is the need to stop selling armor - piercing ammunition on the open market			0
unless the goal is to kill a police officer , certainly rational people can agree that restrictions on the manufacture and sale of this sort of ammunition is in order			0
@entity97 draws heat over shooting game over the past three years , the @entity190 , with a @entity19 supermajority , has adopted statutes that have been offensive to @entity192 , women and youth			1
i have openly resisted those bills , and after the recent elections in which those three demographic groups rejected the @entity19 brand , i had hoped things would change , and that the party leadership would resist the continuing lurch to the far right			1
but even after 20 schoolchildren were killed in @entity206 , leaders of the @entity19 have shown no inclination to resist the gun lobbyists who fund campaigns , but who come empty - handed when asked to craft reasonable gun legislation			1
until the @entity19 hemorrhages more and more centrists , leaders will not wake up to the damage they 're doing to themselves and the party			2
the debate over rational gun control legislation is an opportunity for them to engage in a productive manner to make this nation safer .			0

@entity223 organized a gun buyback in @entity14 , the city where @entity24 was shot
he was *vilified* and *threatened* by *pro-gun* people , who staged a " @entity229 " flea market
this *spurred* @entity223 to leave the @entity19 , which he says is beholden to gun lobby
@entity223 : discussion of sensible *reforms* is *drowned* out by *extremists*
