-- @entity2 gov. @entity1 on tuesday night tried to sell the @entity4 public on the virtues of having the @entity6 in charge of states			1
in a speech at the @entity10 , @entity1 said that unemployment was lower in states led by @entity10 governors than in those headed by @entity15			1
@entity0 @entity16 : @entity17 misleads on ' dependence ' the statement : " in states with @entity10 governors , the average unemployment rate is a full point lower than in states with @entity15 governors			1
@entity10 governors lead seven of the 10 states with the lowest unemployment rates			1
and 12 of the 15 states that have been ranked ' best for business ' have @entity10 governors			2
" the facts : a quick check of the governors ' party affiliations shows 29 states with @entity6 governors , 20 states with @entity15 governors , and one state headed by an independent			1
according to the @entity42 ' preliminary , seasonally adjusted data for july 2012 , 7.84 % of the civilian labor in the 29 states with @entity10 governors were unemployed ( 6,680,400 out of 85,155,600 )			2
the same data set shows that 8.77 % of the 20 states with @entity15 governors were unemployed ( 6,032,500 out of 68,792,500 )			2
the national unemployment rate was 8.3 %			0
@entity0 @entity16 : @entity45 and @entity47 's energy policies the difference between 7.84 % and 8.77 % is n't a full point , though it is close			0
however , there 's nothing in the data itself to show a causal relation			0
it 's also worth noting that in 11 of the @entity10 - led states , the party has had control of the governorship for less than 19 months			2
it is true that , according to the july 2012 bls data , seven of the 10 states with the lowest unemployment rates have @entity10 governors , led by @entity66 , with 3.0 %			1
: 1 ) @entity66 ( r ) 3 % 2 ) @entity67 ( r ) 4 % 3 ) @entity68 ( r ) 4.4 % 4 ) @entity69 ( r ) 4.9 % 5 ) @entity70 ( @entity71 ) 5 % 6 ) @entity72 ( r ) 5.3 % 7 ) @entity73 ( @entity71 ) 5.4 % 8 ) @entity74 ( r ) 5.6 % 9 ) @entity75 ( @entity71 ) 5.8 % 10 ) @entity2 ( r ) 5.9 % in four of those @entity10 - led states ( including @entity1 's @entity2 ) , republicans have held the governorship for less than 19 months			1
the same is true for two of the three @entity81 - led states			0
as for the " best for business " claim , a @entity1 spokesman said the governor was referring to " @entity85 's @entity87 " list			0
the criteria include rankings for workforce , quality of life , economy , infrastructure and transportation , access to capital and cost of living			0
we 'll not go deeper into how @entity85 arrived at its rankings , or how much governors ' actions affected those rankings , but @entity1 's statement that 12 of the list 's top 15 states have @entity10 governors is correct			1
in five of those states , @entity6 have held the governorship for less than two years			2
the same was true for @entity15 in one state			0
verdict : true , but incomplete			0
@entity0 @entity16 : @entity47 's welfare claims wrong @entity0 's @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 gov. @entity1 : unemployment lower in states with @entity6 governors
government data *backs* this up , but in many states , @entity6 is new to office
seven of 10 states with lowest unemployment have @entity6 governors , but party is new to office in four
