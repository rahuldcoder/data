@entity12 is one of five @entity79 soldiers from the 5th @entity80 accused of killing civilians for sport and staging the deaths to look like legitimate war casualties			1
in all , officials charged 12 @entity79 soldiers in what they called a conspiracy to murder @entity4 civilians and cover it up , along with charges they mutilated corpses and kept grisly souvenirs			1
five of the soldiers face murder charges , while seven others are charged with participating in a coverup			2

@entity27 is charged with three counts of murder			0
he is accused of killing @entity4 civilian @entity19 in january with a grenade and rifle ; killing civilian @entity19 in may in a similar manner ; and shooting to death @entity19 in february			1

several soldiers are charged with taking pictures of the corpses , and one soldier is charged with with stabbing a corpse			2
@entity12 ' civilian lawyer , @entity140 , has said his client did not kill any civilian and was ordered by his supervisor , @entity115 , to keep a human finger			1
" there is no proof that ... @entity12 caused or conspired to cause the death of any human being unlawfully , " @entity140 said			2
during a break in the hearing monday , @entity140 told journalists , " the government , as they often do in some these of cases , casts a net entirely too wide			0
" @entity140 has said he plans to ask serious questions about the @entity60 's command of a platoon that everyone agrees went terribly astray			0
" the only way these kind of allegations can occur is the command is completely derelict in supervising , meaning not there , or they 're ignoring that this kind of conduct may be occurring , " @entity140 said			0
" and i do n't know which one it is at this point			0
" the @entity60 refuses to comment on any aspect of any of the cases and has sought to limit circulation of evidence , especially since videotaped interrogations of some of the soldiers and alleged written confessions by some soldiers were obtained and reported by media outlets , including @entity0			0
but it was the @entity60 's own charging documents that portrayed a platoon gone rogue			0
in explicit detail , the @entity60 wrote how killings were staged -- how a fellow soldier was beaten and how @entity115 allegedly threw human fingers at another soldier believed to have snitched about the group 's hashish smoking			0
the @entity60 moved to restrict attorney access to what has been described to @entity0 by some who have seen them as a series of gruesome photos of dead @entity4 by allowing inspection of the material only at a secure facility at @entity6			1
a number of attorneys have objected , telling @entity0 the @entity60 is limiting their ability to defend their clients because it is more concerned how the charges are being played in the media and perceived in @entity4			2
