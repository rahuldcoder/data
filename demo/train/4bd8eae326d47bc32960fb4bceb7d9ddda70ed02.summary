-- as the world watched and waited for little @entity3 to make his royal way into the world in @entity7 , @entity1 was among those wishing the baby would hurry up			1
the reason ? " i 'm going on holiday , " the queen said days before the @entity12 gave birth to the future king on july 22			2
thankfully , @entity3 was born just in time for the queen to begin her official holiday last week at the royal family 's @entity18 retreat , @entity20			1
the queen and members of the royal family will spend the next two months at her 50,000 - acre estate in the @entity18 highlands			1
the castle was originally built by @entity28 and by all accounts of both historians and those who work on the estate , it holds a very special place in the queen 's heart			1
that 's likely because it offers her a level of privacy that she can not find anywhere else			0
every year at this time she travels to the heart of the @entity43 in @entity44 , just outside the small town of @entity46			0
here , behind large metal gates that keep the public outside for most of the royal family 's visit , she has the privacy to stroll with her corgis around the gardens , catch up on correspondence at her @entity55 ( a pine summer cottage that was a gift from the @entity58 government and is one of the queen 's favorite spots on the estate ) , go fly fishing on the @entity63 , or take in a round of golf on her private course			1
but here 's a secret that few people seem to know : you can have the same vacation			0
i 'm not talking about visiting the estate for the day , as many people do when it 's open to the public			1
nope , you can move in			0
settle down in one of five cottages on the estate , and you 'll have access to everything that makes @entity20 so special			1
i speak from experience , having just returned from two weeks in one of the @entity84			0
it was n't my first visit to the castle ; i 've visited every year since i first learned about the holiday cottages four years ago			1
while the @entity84 are the smallest cottages available to rent , they are my favorite because of their close proximity to the castle -- just a couple hundred yards away			1
if you are looking for more room , there are larger cottages to choose from , all rented on a weekly basis			1
the largest cottage is @entity100 , which sleeps up to 13 people and sits farther away from the castle on the shores of @entity104			0
rent for the cottages start around $ 750 a week ( 480 pounds ) , and vary depending on which cottage you choose and the time of the year			1
and you do n't have to leave your dogs at home , they are welcome during your stay			0
the cottages are closed for most of august , september and early october for the royal family 's official visit			1
the cottages are charming , comfortable and fully equipped , but do n't expect crystal chandeliers and marble bathrooms			2
although you 're at @entity20 , it 's more rustic than the @entity123			1
people often ask me what i do for two weeks in the highlands			2
like the royal family , my vacation at the castle is spent outside , enjoying the natural beauty of the region			1
practice your fly fishing on the @entity63 by hiring the queen 's ghillie as your guide for the day			0
bring your clubs and play a round of the estate 's private golf course			2
or just wander around the estate , past waterfalls and through the ancient @entity144 forests			2
thanks to the fact that this area is so far north ( same latitude as southern @entity148 ) it stays light until around 10 p.m. during the summer			0
so grab a book and a picnic basket to enjoy dinner on the castle lawn			0
grill some fresh fish and have a barbeque on the banks of the river			0
these excursions are only available to you , as a guest on the estate			2
after a couple of days it 's hard not to feel like royalty			0
when you are finally ready to leave the estate , you can mingle with the locals at any of the cafes and pubs in the nearby villages of @entity46 and @entity169			2
in addition to offering fresh , locally sourced food , both offer remarkably good shopping			0
there are several art galleries showcasing local artists , bookshops stocked with everything you 'd want to read about the region and country shops where you 'll be able to stock up on @entity182 , @entity184 boots and @entity186 coats			0
if you want a real taste of @entity190 whiskey , there are tours and tastings at the @entity193 , less than a mile from the estate , which has been producing whiskey since the mid 19th century			2
it 's when the castle closes to the public at five o'clock that you really appreciate the uniqueness of staying at @entity20			1
without " tourists " around , the castle grounds are all yours to explore			2
the only thing you might worry about is running into your landlord			0
that 's exactly what happened to me this summer while taking an evening walk around the castle			0
several loud barking corgis ran up to say hello			0
it took a minute to realize that the elderly woman walking the dogs was @entity1 but this was n't a typical celebrity sighting			1
i did n't take out my camera for a picture or ask for an autograph			0
we just waved , she called the dogs back , and both of us went back to enjoying our vacation at @entity20 .			1

cottages on the grounds of @entity20 are available to the public for rent
the royal estate in the @entity18 highlands is a favorite retreat of @entity1
sightings of the royal family are possible for visitors to the estate
the cozy cottages are more rustic than the royal digs
