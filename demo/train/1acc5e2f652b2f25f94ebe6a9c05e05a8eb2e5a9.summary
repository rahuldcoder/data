-- @entity2 's announcement that he wo n't run for an unprecedented fourth term as @entity5 governor next year increases already rampant speculation that he 'll launch another bid for the @entity9 in 2016			1
considering how the @entity12 's 2012 campaign faltered , there 's plenty of skepticism about the viability of a possible second presidential run			1
@entity2 : 2016 ' certainly an option ' the longest - serving governor in @entity5 history did n't reveal much about his political future as he announced on monday that he would n't seek re-election			1
" i will also pray and reflect and work to determine my own future path , " @entity2 told friends and supporters at an event in @entity25			2
he added that " any future considerations i will announce in due time and i will arrive at that decision appropriately			2
" advisers hint at future as @entity2 exits as governor @entity0 national political correspondent @entity33 asked @entity2 after the event about his plans for time off			1
" no time off , man , " @entity2 replied			1
he acknowledged on @entity37 -- the day before his announcement -- that he is keeping his eye on the next presidential campaign calendar , saying that is " certainly , that 's an option			0
" @entity2 advisers also are not shooting down suggestions that the governor is aiming for the @entity46			1
the ill - fated 2012 run is the only black mark on a successful 30 - year career in politics			2
can @entity2 overcome his last presidential run ? he officially jumped into the race the previous august , later than the rest of the @entity12 field and announced his candidacy the same day of the @entity12 's @entity57 straw poll in @entity58 , won by rep. @entity59			1
the best days of his campaign were the first ones , when he quickly topped polls for the @entity12 nomination			1
but the effort soon swooned due to weak debate performances and gaffes			0
@entity68 's most damaging episode was the " oops " moment at a @entity71 debate when he could n't remember the third federal agency he pledged to eliminate if elected president			0
" he was supposed to be the conservative coming in from @entity5 , the new @entity75			2
he bombed in the debates , and i 'm being kind when i say he bombed in the debates , " said @entity0 chief national correspondent @entity76			0
@entity2 continued to fade and posted distant finishes in the @entity57 caucuses and the @entity83 primary			2
he suspended his bid in mid-january , prior to the @entity86 primary			0
if @entity2 could n't handle competitors like @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and other candidates in what was considered a weak @entity12 field last time out , would he fare any better in 2016 ? the roster could be stronger if @entity12 stars like @entity97 gov. @entity96 , sen. @entity98 of @entity99 , sen. @entity100 of @entity101 , former @entity99 gov. @entity102 , and @entity104 gov. @entity103 jump in			1
but if he runs , @entity2 would presumably enter the race at a much earlier date and would n't be fighting high expectations , which were placed on his candidacy from the start last time			1
he can also cite history			0
" i would remind you of this : @entity75 ran more than once ; @entity113 ran more than once to get the nomination , @entity88 ran more than once to get the nomination			0
there 's still a conservative base of the @entity12 that likes @entity2 , " @entity76 said			1
" would he need to do a hell of a lot better if he ran again ? yes			0
but should you rule it out completely ? no. " @entity12 strategist and @entity0 contributor @entity122 also said experience matters			0
" there 's nothing that helps a candidate run and win a nomination like the experience of having run and lost a nomination			0
the benefit of experience for candidates that have gone through the brutality of the process is a crucial advantage			0
that knowledge of what went right and what did n't could serve @entity2 well this time around , " said @entity122			2
@entity122 was a top adviser and spokesman in @entity88 's unsuccessful bid for the 2008 @entity12 nomination , and the 2012 edition , in which @entity88 captured the nomination before losing the president @entity147 last november			1
he said @entity88 's campaign leadership took @entity2 seriously since he could raise money and would make a splash entering a fluid competition for the nomination			1
" but he was destined to fade			0
the entire campaign had the feeling of being thrown together at the last minute			0
you simply can not just waltz into a presidential campaign and win without painstakingly planning it out well in advance , " @entity122 said			0
if @entity2 runs again , his first big test with @entity12 voters would be in @entity57 , where the caucuses traditionally kick off the presidential nominating calendar for voters			1
@entity164 knows something about @entity57 politics			0
he served as the state 's @entity12 chairman in the last presidential cycle			2
" with a wide open @entity12 nomination contest and an unsettled a @entity12 electorate , it would be foolish to write off a candidate with governor @entity2 's record of economic success , " @entity164 told @entity0			1
" @entity176 love a comeback story			0
and a successful @entity2 presidential campaign would certainly be that , " added @entity164 .			2

longest - serving @entity5 governor announced this week he would not seek re-election
decision opens speculation that @entity2 might seek the 2016 @entity12 presidential nomination
@entity2 has had a strong political run , but presidential bid last time out was a flop
competition could be *tougher* , too , if @entity12 stars like @entity98 , @entity96 jump into race
