-- for a recovering addict , reveling at a party or having pills in your room can be seen as a sign you are in control , having successfully defeated your demons -- or just as likely , experts say , a sign of weakness that could lead to a dangerous , if not deadly , outcome			1
on any given day , an estimated 23.5 million @entity13 need help to overcome chronic substance abuse , according to the @entity16 and @entity17			1
by her own admission , @entity18 once was one of them -- until her still unexplained death last saturday in her @entity22 , @entity23 , hotel room			1
funeral for @entity18 set for saturday she had admitted in the past having done marijuana and cocaine , spoke about her mother staging an intervention for her and made several trips to rehab			1
yet more recently , many of her friends contended that @entity18 's spirits , and her health , seemed good			1
authorities have not yet ruled on why the iconic singer died			0
the @entity38 coroner 's office has downplayed the suspicion that drugs played a major role			0
assistant chief coroner @entity42 said monday that " not many prescription bottles " were found in the singer 's @entity44 hotel room after her death			1
the amount of medications recovered by investigators was less than usually present in deaths attributed to overdoses , @entity42 said			0
@entity54 @entity53 told @entity0 that " @entity18 was partying , she was happy ... maybe a little tipsy because she had champagne " at an event two nights before she died			1
mixing pills and drinking can be a " bad , bad combo , " former musician , admitted junkie and now addiction specialist @entity63 said			1
whether or not substance abuse had anything to do with the songstress 's death , her well - chronicled struggles with drugs are a part of her story , just as they were a part of her life			1
@entity74 : death sad , but no shock what is addiction , what it can do to people , and what can be done about it ? the good news , say experts , is that addicts can get better			1
to do so , one critical element is having self - awareness -- understanding the roots of one 's problems , and often pain , plus knowing what environmental or personal triggers might set off a relapse			2
another is control , by being strong enough to resist temptations and to accept one 's vulnerabilities			0
and a third factor is vigilance , given that addiction is a relentless and unforgiving condition , for which any slip - up can be potentially fatal			2
" it is incurable , but it 's treatable , " said @entity105 , a vice president of the @entity108 - based @entity107 treatment center			1
" ( but ) recovery is only possible if the addict or alcoholic is part of the solution			0
" having himself gone to rehab four times in one five - year stretch , @entity105 -- a former journalist who worked at @entity0 in the early 1990s -- stressed that for a @entity18 or other recovering addict , willpower alone does not work			1
nor is recovery as simple as deciding , from here on out , to say no to drugs or alcohol			2
he also disputes the notion that addiction " is a reflection of a bad upbringing ... or a lack of faith			1
" reverend : the @entity18 i knew yet an addict must believe he has a problem			2
while it is more straightforward to tell a patient that a tumor is malignant , a doctor is often more hard - pressed to tell someone they have a serious addiction -- even though it can be deadly , like cancer -- said dr. @entity145 , founder of the @entity147 center			0
and rarely is that first step the last one , addiction - recovery experts say			0
relapses , and repeated visits to rehab centers and treatment programs , are common for addicts before it sinks in how grave their problems are and what they can do about them -- unless the addiction kills them first			0
@entity18 herself admitted in a 2009 interview with @entity161 that she once " did ( her ) 30 days " in one rehab facility , got out , and yet her drug use continued			1
she said she was finally convinced to get serious about her recovery when her mother , renowned gospel singer @entity166 , came to her door with a sheriff and a " court injunction , " saying , " you do it my way or we 're not going to do this at all			0
" @entity18 : a mother , a daughter , a friend aside from any physical challenges , overcoming addiction is hard work mentally and emotionally			1
and if you let down your guard , warns interventionist and " how to help the @entity184 " author @entity183 , it can come back with a vengeance -- as bad , if not worse , than before			2
that 's why specialists say it is so imperative that an addict know what places , situations , smells are more likely to set him or her back			0
they generally recommend that those who have been hooked before -- on whatever substance -- avoid situations like a raging party or raucous club scene , as well as that they take pains to limit their exposure to prescription drugs or alcohol			1
" relapse is just around the corner , but it 's your responsibility as a recovering person to know all your trigger points , " said @entity145			2
the @entity211 executive director , for one , says that relinquishing some control and admitting your limitations -- including what you can handle and can not , at least without help -- is critical to success			0
@entity54 @entity217 said about her good friend that @entity18 was " strong " and " smart as a whip , " yet hesitant to let anyone else make decisions for her			2
" she was her own woman , she made her own choices , and she was adamant about that , " said @entity223			0
it is inevitable , and in many ways essential , that addicts at some point draw up their own boundaries			0
experts say it is not necessary or logical for them to carry on feeling like they are trapped in a bubble , adding it is important that they eventually take ownership of their lives and their problems			0
still , for those with an addictive history , making those decisions comes with great risk			0
" each person gets to decide what their own baseline is , " said @entity183			0
" and it changes for different people , at different times			0
but it 's really a slippery slope , especially if you start taking any drug ( including alcohol ) again			2

before her death , @entity18 had a history of substance abuse issues
an interventionist calls her partying and pills found in her room " a bad , bad combo "
one expert calls drug and alcohol addiction " incurable , but ... treatable "
recognizing , and avoiding , situations that might trigger a relapse is important
