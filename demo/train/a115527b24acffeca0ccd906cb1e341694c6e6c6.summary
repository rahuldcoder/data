-- i know i 'm supposed to be outraged by the @entity3 cover that depicts @entity4 as a dreamy young man , with its implicit resonances with the famous @entity9 photo			1
when taken with the words that overlay it , the photo presents a mystery that we need to explore			1
so , i am not outraged			1
in fact , i am discouraged by the outrage itself			0
i feel obligated to begin by stating that i have no sympathy for a murderer of children , that i was horrified by such actions , and that i feel deeply for the @entity24 bombing 's victims			1
i live in @entity24 and have written about the sense of solidarity @entity27 felt after the attack , and especially on the day we sat still so that suspects could be tracked and caught			0
i rooted for @entity32 's capture , and i hope the alleged killer spends a long time miserable in jail , after a fair trial , of course			1
but the very fact that we have to gain entry to the conversation by stating our bona fides like this disturbs me			0
culture is based on shared values and beliefs			0
having to state that you 're against the killing and maiming of families and the loved ones they were cheering on creates a rift where there is n't one , as if this value were not a settled part of what binds our culture			0
could we even come up with a stance that more quickly and surely means that you 're not a part of the lives we share together ? the @entity3 cover correctly assumes that there is no such rift			1
it assumes that of course we all hate what the @entity4 and his older brother , the late @entity69 , are accused of doing ( @entity4 has pleaded not guilty to federal charges in connection with bombings )			1
the words on that cover state what many of us — the " us " that covers our culture — believe : he was a bomber			1
there is n't even an " alleged " there , and the premise of the article stated on the cover also denies that qualifier : " how a popular , promising student was failed by his family , fell into radical @entity87 and became a monster			1
" in case you were unclear about where @entity3 stands on @entity4 , the words " bomber " and " monster " should make it clear			1
but you should n't be unclear			0
that 's why we have a culture -- a shared set of values and beliefs			1
the words are not causing the outrage that the photo has engendered			0
but when taken with the words , the angelic photo makes exactly the point that needs to be made and that our culture of @entity109 obscures			0
when a terrorist was raised in a foreign land , and especially when to the mainstream the terrorist looks foreign and repellent — for example , the photo of an unkempt , grim @entity111 that has become so iconic that it 's even used at @entity113 , a site that takes a " neutral point of view " as its mantra — we feel safe in simply assigning the person to a category			2
" he 's a terrorist , " we say , as if that were a biological species that completely explains the person			2
such categories shut down thought			0
terrorist ? ' @entity132 said			0
but it 's not enough			2
understanding is important not only so that we can help prevent the sort of despicable @entity139 bombers and the @entity140 of our fractured world , but also so we can see our human species — and thus ourselves — more clearly			0
the cover photo of @entity4 taken with the stark words overlaying it speak to the mystery that was laid bare when the brothers were first identified			1
the media turned to his friends , interviewing young men and women who were profoundly shocked that someone they knew as helpful , warm , and open to diversity could be accused of so deeply betraying their values			0
i felt like i knew many of those friends , for they were so like our children and the children they know			0
that was the mystery that was presented to us when the @entity163 were identified not only as murder suspects , but as a threat to the humane innocence that is the heart of @entity168 culture			2
we need that mystery explored			2
to counter our natural desire to think that those who attack us so vilely must be totally unlike us , we need not only the words denouncing them , but images that reminds us that they were n't born as what they became			0
this juxtaposition makes the mystery manifest : someone like us became someone who hates us			2
we need to explore that mystery not so we can sympathize with a despicable accused murderer but so we understand better how he passed beyond sympathy			2
the cover of @entity3 -- words and picture -- puts that awful mystery right in front of us			1
but we seem to prefer the security of outrage			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			1

@entity192 says he 's not outraged about the @entity3 cover
he asks , why must we prove bombings upset us before we can discuss not minding cover ?
he says cover assumes that we all agree bombings were an act of a monster
@entity192 : cover confronts the mystery of someone like us who came to hate us
