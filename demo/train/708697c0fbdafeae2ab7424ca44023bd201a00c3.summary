-- the path that brought @entity3 citizen @entity2 to the point of pleading guilty to involvement in two international terrorism plots is complicated and twisted			1
his life , in many ways , is far from the average @entity3 experience , but he 's also very much a product of a typical @entity3 upbringing			1
he 's an unusual fusion , a product of two worlds , a rare blending of @entity16 and @entity17			1
and because of his unusual background , @entity2 , experts say , is one of the most unusual and important @entity3 - born terrorists			1
even his eyes -- one blue and one brown -- reflect the double life he has lived almost since the day he was born			0
@entity2 pleaded guilty thursday to all 12 charges against him in connection with the four - day siege on @entity29 's financial capital in 2008 that left more than 160 people dead and a planned attack in @entity33			1
@entity2 , the son of an @entity3 mother and @entity36 father , was accused of extensive involvement in planning the devastating attacks on hotels in @entity40 , which the @entity29 government says were carried out by the @entity36 - based terrorist group @entity42			1
at least six @entity3 were among the dead			0
@entity2 , 49 , was indicted last october and charged by the @entity3 government for conspiracy to murder and maim people in @entity29 and provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization			1
he initially pleaded not guilty to the charges , but he has changed his plea as part of a deal with the government to cooperate with investigators and possibly to avoid the death penalty he might have received if convicted on some of the charges			0
in the federal courtroom in @entity60 , @entity61 , on thursday , @entity2 told the judge that he did not dispute any of the 12 charges			2
by pleading guilty , he also gave up his right to appeal in the case			0
he faced six counts of conspiracy to bomb locations in @entity29 and to murder and maim persons in @entity29 and @entity33 , and six counts of aiding and abetting the murder of @entity3 citizens in @entity29			2
the indictment against him charged that @entity2 scouted targets in @entity40 for more than two years to set up the november 2008 attacks			1
he was also accused of planning a terrorist attack on a @entity33 newspaper , which was never carried out			0
the newspaper became the target of @entity81 fury in 2005 after it published cartoons depicting the @entity83 in a manner offensive to @entity85			0
even family asks : who is @entity2 ? now that he 's admitted to conspiracy to murder and maim in the @entity40 attack , even members of his own family are wondering who @entity2 really is			1
" i was really shocked			0
and just did n't expect something like that			0
and i mean such a hands - on accusation , " said @entity97 , his uncle , reflecting on when he first learned of the government 's accusations against his nephew			1
" it was like you had poured cold water inside my chest			0
" @entity2 was born in 1960 in @entity107 , but with a different name : at birth , he was given the @entity111 name @entity2			2
he was the son of an eccentric , flamboyant and rebellious high society mother from @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 ; and a strict , formal @entity36 diplomat father , @entity117			1
the couple met at the @entity119 in @entity107 but moved to @entity120 , @entity36 , when their son was very young			2
" he was the first baby i had anything to do with , " his uncle @entity97 said			0
" he was the first baby i ever touched or held or anything like that			0
and somewhere i have a photograph of me in my pajamas holding little @entity128			0
... he was a nice - looking little baby			0
" @entity131 union of @entity16 and @entity17 after only a few years , @entity133 's parents split up , an early sign of the fractious union of @entity16 and @entity17			1
the separation left @entity133 straddled between his traditional @entity81 father and his very @entity138 , very @entity3 mother			2
for a time , his mother remained in @entity36 , but she eventually returned to @entity114 , where she opened a popular bar called the @entity141			1
the @entity141 is the name of the main passage between @entity36 and @entity144			2
@entity133 remained in @entity36 throughout much of his childhood , and as a teenager he was enrolled for several years at a prestigious and regimented @entity36 military academy , the @entity147			2
but then his mother pulled him out of the school and brought him back to @entity114			1
there , the teen moved into his mother 's apartment above the bar			2
in 2006 , @entity2 changed his name to @entity2 , borrowing the family 's @entity3 name , and even the middle name of @entity97 's father , @entity158			1
the change was made , @entity3 officials believe , to help @entity2 escape detection and travel more easily between the @entity3 , @entity29 and @entity36			1
in an exclusive television interview with @entity0 in january , @entity2 's uncle described his disbelief in learning that his own nephew was connected in any way to the massacre in @entity40 -- disbelief that lingered until he began receiving letters from his nephew in his jail cell			1
" to find an insider in my own family involved [ in terrorism ] -- you 're not responsible for what your family does and yet you have such a close association with it , it 's your blood			0
" @entity2 wrote to his uncle from jail , saying that despite his heritage , he was now 100 percent muslim			1
@entity2 's life has been full of twists and turns , from his dual heritage childhood -- being equally comfortable in @entity36 's @entity81 circles and in @entity114 's social scene -- to his marriage to a blond @entity3 beauty and subsequent divorce , after which he took a traditional @entity81 wife			1
drug trafficking snare in the 1990s , @entity2 became a major drug dealer and turned informant for the @entity199 after being caught , according to his family			2
his involvement with the @entity199 may have been one of the factors that pushed him toward @entity85 extremism			0
in 1997 , he was running a video shop in @entity206			0
on february 7 of that year , he was in a midtown hotel negotiating to bring a large load of heroin from the @entity16 to @entity206			1
but he had walked into a trap			0
the hotel room , on the ninth floor , was wired by the @entity213			0
as @entity2 tried to escape , he found himself surrounded by gun - toting @entity199 agents			1
it was a moment that became the ultimate turning point in his life , said his uncle			1
" @entity133 said ' if i get free of this i 'm going to commit myself to @entity219 , ' " @entity97 recounted			0
" so that is when , i would say , he became a serious muslim			0
" what happened next is somewhat of a mystery			0
while his co-conspirator in the drug deal went to prison for 10 years , @entity2 was out within 15 months			2
his family believes the @entity199 was using him as their own informant , frequently sending him to @entity36 and @entity144 to meet directly with heroin dealers			2
those trips may also have put @entity2 in direct contact with @entity85 terror groups who use the drug trade to finance their operations			2
it was during this time that he may have first encountered @entity42 , the @entity36 group that some say is now second only to @entity238 in its global terrorist reach			1
the indictment indicated that @entity2 had moved among senior figures in @entity42 -- including @entity242 , who 's alleged to have had contacts with @entity238			1
@entity2 case called unique the @entity2 case is unique for many reasons , experts say			2
" it reads like a spy novel more than your typical terrorism cases , " said @entity247 , who heads the @entity248			0
he says @entity2 was a sophisticated and valuable asset for anyone in the terrorist world , because of his ability to move easily between the @entity16 and the @entity17			1
" this is someone who clearly lived in two different worlds and grew up in two different worlds and had an awareness of both the @entity3 -- having spent much of his adult life and later childhood life here -- as well as in @entity36 , " said @entity247			1
" clearly , you have someone who was conflicted , even though he lived in both worlds			0
you get the sense that he never felt at home in either world , searching for his identity ... and we know how , unfortunately , it plays out , " he added			0
@entity2 's uncle still finds it hard to believe			1
he was shocked when @entity0 called to tell him that his nephew was pleading guilty			0
the nephew he knew was not someone who could have been involved in a terrorist plot , @entity97 said			0
" we absolutely can not imagine it , " he said			0
" it 's not at all consistent with anything we know at all			0

@entity2 is a product of two worlds , a rare blending of @entity16 and @entity17
his mother was a fun - loving @entity114 socialite ; his father was a strict , formal @entity36
his arrest in a heroin sting was a turning point in his life , an uncle says
he 's been tied to @entity42 ; @entity29 says group carried out @entity40 attacks
