responsible financial decision was setting up a checking account that rounded up every purchase i made to the next dollar and shuttled the extra change into a mini savings account			0
when a friend from the business school suggested i 'd be better off investing that money , i ignored him completely			2
none of the seemingly complex investing options he proposed made any sense to my 19 - year - old mind			2
i was happy to let my money accrue nickel by dime by penny in what amounted to a glorified piggy bank			0
as it turns out , i was n't all that different from the rest of my penny - pinching generation			0
one recent study by @entity28 called millennials the " most fiscally conservative generation since the @entity37 , " saying they hold the bulk of their assets in cash and view saving , not investing , as the most sound financial strategy			2
often , members of this generation find themselves either unable to come up with a lump sum to meet account minimums for most investment firms , or they 're simply unwilling to pay a financial adviser 's hefty commission fees			2
now , a startup called @entity47 wants to solve these problems with a new smartphone app , hoping it can help millennials outgrow the piggy bank			1
much like the checking account i set up all those years ago , the app links to a user 's debit or credit card and rounds up on every purchase			1
but rather than letting the cash stagnate , @entity47 invests it			1
users can choose one of five portfolios , ranging from conservative to aggressive risk , and the cost is $ 1 a month , plus anywhere from 0.25 % to 0.5 % of their earnings			1
they can also withdraw their funds at any time			2
' fiscally conservative generation ' with this app , @entity47 joins a growing list of startups attempting to create an onramp for a new type of investor , the under - 30 set , which many have referred to as " the recession generation			1
" companies like @entity80 and @entity81 are using behavioral science and automation to reduce human error in investing and charge lower fees than traditional financial advisors			2
but @entity47 takes a more streamlined approach			1
founded by @entity89 and @entity90 , a father - and - son team from @entity92 , @entity93 , the startup is hoping that its dead simple " invest the change " model can serve as a sort of gateway drug to the wider world of investing			2
haunting photos of the children toiling in @entity103 's limestone mines if successful , @entity47 could radically change the narrative of this generation , transforming them from post-recession conservatives to savvy financial risk takers			1
" there are 315,000 financial advisers out there			0
we 're not trying to compete with them , " says @entity111 , the company 's ceo			2
" we 're trying to be the starter account , the farm school , the incubator			0
" that plan appears to be paying off			0
among the more than 10,000 users who tested @entity47 before launch , more than one third of them are under the age of 22 , and a full 85 percent are under the age of 35			1
" we 're really excited to be engaging this young group , " says @entity90 , @entity47 ' coo , a millennial himself			1
' it 's going to happen this way ' the young co-founder is unique among his peers in that he 's been investing in the stock market since he was in high school , something he owes largely to his father 's influence			1
before founding @entity47 , @entity89 launched the investment banking firm @entity138 , now @entity139 , and also started the investment banking arm of @entity141			1
it was during @entity90 's senior year at @entity144 that he and @entity89 began discussing how technology had drastically reduced the cost of trading			1
@entity89 predicted that this cost reduction would usher in a new age of microinvesting in the @entity150 " @entity90 held up his smartphone and he said : ' @entity153 , it 's going to happen this way , " @entity89 remembers			1
why are we so fat ? the multimillion - dollar scientific quest to find out from that day on , the two began brainstorming ways to build an investment platform for a demographic that 's both mobile - first and wary of traditional investing			2
originally , they planned to design a front - end app for existing companies , like @entity165 or @entity166 , but soon realized that the multitude of options those companies offer investors would only overwhelm @entity47 ' potential users			1
" we had to consider people who are ubering home and walking down the street			0
they do n't have a check with them or 15 minutes to pore over a complicated document , " @entity90 says			0
" we wanted to simplify and streamline it			0
" so the team spent the next two years dealing with regulators and becoming their own broker dealer , raising some $ 9 million in funding along the way			0
all the while , they worked on simplifying the technology to enable users to set up an account and start investing in minutes			0
users sign up using their bank username and password , and provide basic details about themselves , including their social security number , income , net worth , and investment goals			0
that allows @entity47 to recommend the right portfolio for them			2
rather than offering an array of investment options , @entity47 only offers users so - called exchange traded funds			2
unexpected shooting targets used by the world 's armies this both simplifies the set up process for users and lowers @entity47 ' own costs , by reducing the number of variables the system needs to contend with			1
" there 's not a place to put in a stock symbol or a price or type of order , " says @entity89			0
" it just sweeps your money into this pre-constructed portfolio , and when you want it , you withdraw instantly			0
" the @entity227 of investing @entity47 has been called the @entity227 of investing			1
just as @entity227 made online dating as easy as swiping left or right , so too has @entity47 simplified the often tedious and complex process of investing			1
but that does n't mean the investment strategy is any less sophisticated			0
the portfolios were designed with help from dr. @entity237 , a @entity238 winner , who is commonly referred to as the father of modern portfolio theory			0
@entity90 met dr. @entity237 through a friend who was a student of his at the @entity243			0
when dr. @entity237 heard about @entity47 , he took a special interest in the company and worked as a paid adviser in the company 's early days			1
" investing in a broadly diversified portfolio for the long term is the right choice for most people , " dr. @entity237 said in a statement			0
" @entity47 enables this to happen automatically in tiny increments with minimal cost			1
this has the potential to help people across all demographics			0
" of course , all by itself , this approach is n't likely to make anyone rich			0
the average user invests about $ .57 per transaction , with three transactions a day			1
that 's about $ 50 a month			1
according to @entity90 , the average expected return of these portfolios ranges from 4 to 9 percent			0
the hope is that as @entity47 ' users become more accustomed to investing , they 'll opt to invest even more of their money in the markets			1
and when that day comes , the @entity276 say , they 'll be ready			0
" we want to make our investors feel comfortable as their accounts grow , so our focus on small accounts is n't at the expense of large accounts , " @entity90 says			0
" we built the platform to handle multimillion dollar accounts			0
