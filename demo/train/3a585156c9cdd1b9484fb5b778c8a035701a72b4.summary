-- where better to while away the afternoon than a communal table at one of these beer halls and gardens , from an old - time @entity7 favorite to a newcomer with all @entity10 brews			1
the tables and benches fill up quickly inside @entity13 , a @entity15 mainstay , whose stripped - down aesthetic sticks to exposed - brick walls , a planked floor , and no kitsch			0
even more desirable is a spot in the patio - like garden in the back , where the concrete walls are brightened with planters			1
do n't come looking for the newest microbrew from the @entity26 : the draft and bottle list here is @entity30 - only			0
try one of the two smooth , light @entity32 , which -- like the owner -- are from @entity34			0
they 're served in traditional narrow glasses that hold about seven ounces ( 200 ml )			0
7 rivington st. , 212/253 - 7077 , @entity36 , beer from $ 3			1
@entity38 , who presides over a growing @entity40 restaurant empire , brings a little bit of @entity42 to the @entity15 with beer garden , @entity44			1
enter by navigating a facade that still looks like a greasy takeout joint -- and come ready to quaff			0
the options on the all - asian beer list are delivered in ice - filled metal pails in batches of six , 12 , or 24 bottles			1
seafood reigns on the street - food - inspired menu ; the shrimp summer rolls ( $ 7 ) and red snapper in a tamarind sauce pack a flavorful punch ( $ 18 )			0
154 orchard st. , 212/780 - 0010 , beer from $ 4.50			1
@entity0 : @entity60 's top college football towns a former candy , tobacco , and spices storage facility , @entity65 & @entity66 became stein central in 2007 , when its long benches , oval tables , and annex with a retractable roof began to draw brew - loving locals : soccer fans , young families , and music lovers			1
a full kitchen means there 's more than just sausages like the kielbasa ( $ 9 ) ; either the schnitzel or the goulash , for instance , make for majorly satisfying eating ( both $ 16 )			0
the dozen - odd draft list , primarily from @entity30 , includes the stellar wheat beer @entity85 and the citrusy @entity87			1
well - priced specials keep both the suds and the good feelings flowing ; on weekdays that vibe 's often abetted by live 1920s - and ' 30s - era jazz			1
113 n. 3rd st. , @entity93 , @entity94 , 718/963 - 3973 , @entity95 , beer from $ 7			1
raise your glasses ! five fall beer fests @entity100 takes the beer garden indoors , with picnic tables , flags , and pennants from all over @entity30 , and a bar with half - liter steins and one - liter glasses at the ready			1
the @entity109 pilsner is a rightfully popular choice			0
requisite sausages like @entity112 and brats are represented , but save some room for the piquant sides , namely the potato and pickled cucumber salad			0
the actual garden out back is small and fills up quickly as workers make their exodus from @entity122 's office towers and locals stop by to shoot the breeze over some wurst			2
a smaller " express " branch is a few blocks away , on @entity128			0
626 10th ave. , 212/977 - 1944 , @entity129 , beer from $ 5			2
@entity0 : @entity132 's weirdest hotels come early to @entity133 , a never - deserted corner in the party - hearty @entity135 -- it 's especially hopping during soccer matches and on weekends , when an exuberant , preppy crowd sits for hours enjoying @entity30 brews and sharing plates of schnitzel , spaetzle , and sausage			1
if you 're in the mood for something mild , opt for a @entity149 ( cyclist ) , a refreshing mix of lager beer and lemon - lime soda that will keep you road - ready ( half - liter $ 5 , one liter $ 10 )			2
107 ave. c , 212/598 - 1098 , @entity154 , beer from $ 4			2
@entity156 is a living relic from the early 1900s , when @entity159 's population swelled with @entity160 , @entity30 , and @entity161 , who made beer gardens an everyday part of city life			1
still owned and operated by its founding @entity160 - @entity161 benevolent society , the beer hall keeps the @entity170 - @entity169 vibe intact with live music and waitresses able to lug an impressive number of steins of @entity175 , a popular @entity160 beer on tap			2

@entity0 : the coolest small towns in @entity60 when beer halls start to seem too rowdy and loud , head to much calmer @entity188 in @entity189			1
although the bare - bones , redbrick courtyard and its metal café chairs and tables wo n't win any design awards , @entity188 's distance from the street makes it a serene locale for sipping one of the @entity200 beers that pair amiably with the mussels and fries -- the only things on the menu			2
the bar 's interior is decorated with a pressed - tin ceiling , hurricane lamps , and a small bar cozied up against a back corner and dimly lit with bare red lightbulbs			0
it 's all quite soothing			0
after a few sips , you could imagine yourself transported to a sleepy side street in @entity217 's @entity216			0
