@entity0 , @entity1 -- two moments have changed @entity5 ' life			1
both occurred on the football field			1
the first happened nearly a decade ago			0
it was november 2 , 2001 , and @entity5 was watching his son 's football game in @entity12 , @entity1			1
@entity13 , a high school senior , had three offers to play college football , and that night , he was having the game of his life			1
with four minutes left in the fourth quarter , he made a touchdown - saving tackle			0
" i could hear my teammates saying , ' @entity13 , come on , let 's go , ' " @entity13 , now 26 , remembered			1
" and i could n't move			0
" at the hospital , doctors told @entity5 and his wife that their son had suffered a spinal cord injury			1
if @entity13 survived , he 'd probably never be able to move anything below his shoulders			2
@entity13 nearly died twice during those early days			2
but his condition stabilized , and @entity5 quit his job to become his full - time caregiver			2
the family adjusted to their new circumstances , but @entity5 , 55 , said it was n't easy			2
" you do n't want to even think that your son may never walk again , " he said			0
" that was a hard pill to swallow			0
" near the first anniversary of his injury , @entity13 was struggling with depression			2
to cheer him up , @entity5 invited him out to do something he 'd always enjoyed -- watching high school football			1
it was the first time @entity13 had been out to watch a game since his injury			2
but that afternoon , as they watched from the stands , the unthinkable happened : a player went down and lay immobilized on the field			0
@entity5 and @entity13 knew immediately that it was a spinal cord injury			1
" @entity13 turned to me and said , ' @entity54 , we 've got to go help him , ' " @entity5 recalled			1
in that moment , @entity5 's life changed again : he found his mission			1
he and @entity13 visited the injured player and his family in the hospital , and within months , @entity60 -- a nonprofit that helps athletes who 've suffered spinal cord injuries while playing high school football -- was born			1
it 's a fraternity that now includes 19 injured players in @entity1			2
many spinal injury organizations raise money for medical research			0
but from the start , @entity5 wanted to provide emotional support to injured athletes and their families			1
whenever a new player joins the group , he and @entity13 drive to visit them no matter where they live in the state			2
@entity5 helps the families face myriad emotional , financial and practical issues , while @entity13 encourages and mentors the athletes			1
" we try to provide information , inspiration and hope , " @entity5 said			2
" we want to make sure they do n't feel alone			0
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2011 @entity90 the @entity91 reports that 79 high school football players suffered spinal cord injuries in the @entity94 between 2000 and 2009			1
while these injuries occur at all levels of the game , @entity5 says that high school athletes are much more likely to suffer extreme financial hardship			1
" someone injured on a professional level is going to be taken care of , " he said			0
" but on a high school level , it 's a totally different story			0
" in the first year alone , these injuries can cost from $ 240,000 to well over $ 800,000 , according to the @entity106			0
when schools or school districts do n't have a catastrophic injury policy -- as was the case with @entity13 and @entity111 , another @entity112 -- injured athletes can receive as little as $ 10,000 to cover expenses			2
@entity5 says that even when schools and families do have insurance , the deductibles and out - of - pocket costs can be crushing to a family			1
while @entity60 was n't started to give families financial support , @entity5 devotes a lot of time to this issue			1
he helps families organize their own fundraising efforts , and @entity60 often pitches in when there 's a specific need			1
the group has helped buy wheelchairs and wheelchair - accessible vehicles , and it has also helped remodel homes , installing wheelchair ramps and wheelchair - accessible bathrooms			0
every month , @entity5 also sends each family a $ 100 @entity138 gift card to help buy necessary supplies			2
@entity5 and @entity13 work on the prevention side , too			1
they drive more than 1,000 miles every month to meet with football coaches and trainers at conferences around the country			0
their goal is to raise awareness about their work and encourage coaches to teach proper hitting technique , which reduces the chances of head and spinal cord injuries			1
@entity60 is a father - son partnership -- a labor of love for @entity13 and @entity5 , neither of whom receive compensation for their efforts			1
while @entity13 is deeply committed to their mission , he 's quick to acknowledge that @entity5 does the lion 's share of the work			1
" we get calls nationwide ... all hours of the night and day , and he wo n't turn anybody down , " @entity13 said			2
" behind the scenes , he gets everything done			0
" the elder @entity5 gets it done from his easy chair in the living room , via his cell phone and laptop			0
it 's a location that not only allows him to be within earshot of @entity13 , who still depends on him for care , but makes it easy for him to keep up with the latest scores on his big - screen tv			1
the rest of the @entity60 share @entity5 ' passion for sports , so get - togethers often involve a game of some kind			1
the activity of choice ? going to a football game			0
" i get the question a lot : ' how can you still support the game of football ? ' " @entity5 said			1
" well , that game is what brings them together			0
" we 're a band of brothers , " he said			0
" our biggest bond is football			0
" web extra : crippling injuries do n't dim players ' love of football @entity5 stresses that he is n't trying to deter anyone from playing football			1
in fact , the father and son believe that the discipline and can - do attitude instilled in @entity13 by his coaches helped him to recover and even regain some movement in his arms			1
" we still love the game of football , " @entity5 said			2
" but we need to do a better job to help these young men when this does happen			0
... we want to make sure these kids are not forgotten			0
" word about @entity60 has spread around the country in the last couple of years , and more than 40 families from outside @entity1 have reached out to @entity5			1
someday , he hopes to set up a national network , with branches to help the injured players in each state			0
he also wants to establish a fund in @entity1 to support high school players who suffer severe injuries			2
until then , he will continue his personal crusade to support these athletes and their families			0
helping these young men -- whom he calls his heroes -- has become his life 's work			0
" they 've never quit			0
they 've never given up , " he says			0
" that 's what keeps me pushing			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity60 website at @entity248 and see how to help .			0
