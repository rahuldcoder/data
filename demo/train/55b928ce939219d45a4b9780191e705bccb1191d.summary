@entity0 -- is it wrong to watch football while the world 's on fire ? is it wrong to love the @entity7 , to get excited about a goal scored in @entity9 while there 's mayhem in @entity12 , destruction in @entity14 , @entity16 troops massing near @entity17 ? the answer is no. @entity19			1
when i was a child i had what i thought was a brilliant idea : instead of fighting all those awful wars , countries with gripes should challenge each other to a soccer game			2
the victor could be declared the winner without all the nastiness of fighting a real war			2
my childhood plan for world peace did n't pan out , but soccer , and the @entity7 in particular , remains the premiere arena for make - believe international conflict			1
it captivates massive crowds , stokes intense rivalries and fills people with surprisingly intense emotions			1
this is true even for the people caught in the middle of real wars			1
in @entity14 , in the middle of a civil war , rebel fighters put their weapons aside to watch the @entity7			1
in @entity54 , as the ruthless @entity52 jihadists march toward the @entity12 capital , cafes are filled with people watching the @entity7			1
in @entity58 , @entity57 officials took a break from nuclear negotiations to watch their team			1
refugees , astronauts , politicians are all watching the @entity7			1
clearly , there 's no need for the rest of us to feel guilty			2
no need for mixed feeling about switching between @entity72 's announcement on @entity12 and the @entity75 - @entity74 match			2
in @entity77 , where nationalism got a bad name after @entity80 , patriotic pride overflows with uncharacteristic fearlessness when the national teams play			0
even people who never pay attention to soccer , known almost everywhere as football , are cheering , bragging about @entity88 's spectacular diving header against @entity89			1
the streets of @entity0 , where i am right now , are filled with the royal colors , with orange streamers , orange flags and toy soccer balls hanging over pedestrian streets and canal boats			0
when the @entity99 plays , everyone watches			0
people love sports , but they love the @entity7 for special reasons			1
like other competitions , it resembles life in that the outcomes are the product of skill , merit , luck and even unfairness			0
all the preparation in the world can come to nothing because of a slip in the grass , an unexpected shove , a referee 's mistake			1
unlike other tournaments , this one puts countries of all sizes on the stage			0
small ones can topple big ones			0
it seems as if entire nations take each other on			0
all the wealth and power in the world can not protect a squad			2
the @entity134 is an underdog			0
@entity137 was defeated by tiny , tight - shirted @entity138			0
the tournament distills human emotions to their essence			2
with so much passion , every point triggers an explosion of unadulterated happiness			0
what can capture human emotions better than those reaction images from the stands ? in @entity0 , when the team scores , i mute my television and hear the entire city roar with exhilaration			0
the tournament may have political resonance , occasionally pitting rival countries , but it also brings out the child in every fan			0
i have seen grown men walk around wearing neon - bright orange wigs , no doubt wishing they were in the stands in @entity163 with their faces painted and @entity166 cheese for a hat			0
another electrifying aspect of the @entity7 is that the entire world is watching , even in countries not playing			1
i have found myself working in a variety of countries during the @entity7 , often during times of conflict			1
for some reason , people everywhere seem to dance in the streets when @entity9 wins a match			0
national pride is tightly wound with every country 's squad			0
when a @entity99 actress tweeted a photoshopped picture making it look as if @entity75 players were snorting the foam marking kick lines , @entity75 protested , and the actress , @entity188 , lost her post as a @entity191 ambassador			0
the idea that there could be a connection between soccer and peace , as it turns out , came up long before i mentioned it to my father years ago			0
one of history 's poignant moments came during @entity201 , in december 1914 -- almost exactly 100 years ago -- when a @entity203 truce was declared and @entity205 and @entity206 soldiers set their guns aside to play a friendly soccer match			1
when the truce ended , the killing resumed			0
unfortunately , soccer is no panacea			0
even violence directly connected to the @entity7 occurs			1
for most , the @entity7 is a wonderful distraction from the difficulties of daily life , from wars and from work , from challenging circumstances and from the knowledge that there is so much else that is serious and troubling in the world			1
it is not wrong to watch , much less to enjoy the event , even if it does not prevent or stop any real wars			1
around the globe , the @entity7 is a source of sheer excitement , except for the moment when one 's favorite team loses			1
but here 's the beauty : when your team loses the disappointment is deep , the sadness is real			1
then you remember it 's just a game			2
it 's really not the end of the world			2
note : an earlier version of this story incorrectly said @entity16 did n't qualify for the @entity7			2
join us on @entity248 / @entity247 .			0

@entity250 : is it ok to watch @entity7 games while the world is in strife ?
she says people everywhere take a break to bask in the emotion of the games
there 's a long history of sport being a *harmless* way to *express* rivalries , she says
@entity267 : it 's just a game , but the emotions are real
