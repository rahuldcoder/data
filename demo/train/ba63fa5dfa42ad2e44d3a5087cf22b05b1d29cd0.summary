this past week , my inbox blew up with e-mails asking whether @entity4 's first amendment rights were violated in the uproar over the @entity8 owner 's racist remarks about black people			1
after all , he was simply expressing his views , however unpopular			0
while he did have some rights violated , his first amendment rights remain intact			1
the @entity14 protects you from the government punishing you because of your speech			1
the @entity18 is a private club , and it can discipline @entity4 all it wants			1
what about the chorus of criticism ? are we all violating his first amendment rights by criticizing him ? we are punishing him for his speech			1
the @entity14 does not insulate you from criticism			0
in fact , that 's the @entity14 in action			2
that is how the marketplace of ideas works			1
we float our ideas in the marketplace , and we see which idea sells			1
most everyone would agree that @entity4 's ideas fail in the marketplace of ideas			1
nevertheless , i reluctantly stand on @entity4 's side today			1
what happened to him may have been illegal and was morally wrong			1
in @entity46 , you ca n't record a conversation without the knowledge or consent of both parties			2
the recording featuring @entity4 and @entity52 may be the result of a crime			1
once she gathered this information , someone leaked it ( she denies it was her ) -- and it went viral			0
this is where i think things went morally wrong			1
we all say things in private that we might not say in public			2
sometimes we have ideas that are not fully developed -- we try them out with our closest friends			2
consider it our test - marketplace of ideas			1
as our ideas develop , we consider whether to make them public			0
should we not all have the freedom to make that choice on our own ? the @entity77 rancher @entity76 made his own stupid and bigoted statements , and he 's been nationally pilloried , too -- but he chose to make those statements to the world			0
he deserves every ounce of obloquy heaped upon him			0
but does @entity83 ? think about what his public character execution means			1
it means that we now live in a world where if you have any views that are unpopular , you now not only need to fear saying them in public , but you need to fear saying them at all -- even to your intimate friends			0
they might be recording you , and then that recording may be spread across the internet for everyone to hear			0
is n't it bad enough that the @entity100 can spy on all of us ? how can we complain when we condone giving our closest friends the ability to do worse -- perhaps just to try and destroy us			0
in the novel " 1984 , " @entity103 wrote of the @entity105 , a device that beamed information into the home but that also spied on people constantly			0
even if we were to stop the @entity100 in its tracks , would we still now live in a world where the @entity105 watches us ? only instead of an oppressive government installing it in our apartments , it is conveniently placed in the hands of our dear friends			0
the @entity83 story is not that we found a bigot and dragged him to the gallows in the middle of the marketplace of ideas			1
the @entity83 story is about how there is no more privacy			1
we live in a world where you can share your intimate photos with your lover , and they will wind up on a " revenge porn " website			0
we live in a world where our intimate conversations will be recorded and blasted to billions of listeners			0
we live in a world where , say a gold digger can spy on her sugar daddy , and the world says that the creepy old guy is the bad guy			0
do n't get me wrong			2
@entity4 does seem to be a bad person			2
but sometimes the bad person is also the victim , and he stands in for us			0
as you applaud @entity52 for bringing the racist old man 's views to light , consider if it were you speaking to a woman friend in what you thought was a private conversation			2
do we now live in a world where we can trust nobody ? where there is no privacy ? in this story , there are two villains			0
@entity4 represents the bad old days			2
but @entity52 's behavior represents the horrifying future			0
should n't we condemn the complete breakdown of privacy and trust at least as loudly as we condemn some old man 's racist blathering ?			2

@entity166 : @entity4 's first amendment rights were n't violated in *scandal*
government is n't punishing speech , he says , but @entity4 's ideas failed in marketplace
he says *problem* was recording of @entity83 may have been illegal , leaking it morally wrong
@entity166 : this could happen to any of our private conversations today and it 's *chilling*
