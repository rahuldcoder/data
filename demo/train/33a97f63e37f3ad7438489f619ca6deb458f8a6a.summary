-- for some reason , moviemakers have n't been falling over themselves to glorify the exciting and heroic lives of bike messengers -- which at least leaves director @entity5 with a clear field			1
and if it 's a two - wheeled , pedal - powered adrenaline charge you 're after , this is definitely the movie to watch			2
yes , the plot is contrived and stretched much too thin			0
yes , the characters are strictly off the peg			0
and yes , this flick is essentially a one - trick pony			0
but at least it 's something different			2
" @entity24 " is loaded with on - road action , scarcely pausing for breath as courier @entity18 ( @entity19 ) criss - crosses @entity20 on his austere steel - frame , fixed - gear , no - brakes bone - rattler			1
@entity18 takes his handle from the @entity26 , but he 's got more in common with @entity27 , zipping through the city 's canyons , slaloming around cabs and pedestrians , oblivious to red lights and traffic regulations			1
@entity19 's an attractive and engaging actor , but motorists may find it challenging to overlook this guy 's reckless and self - centered road sense , which is dressed up here as your typical zen - existential - death - wish trip			1
the @entity26 role -- one @entity42 monday -- falls to @entity43 's current go - to crazy , @entity44 ( " @entity45 , " " @entity46 " ) , who sucks up all the juiciest dialogue as a guy with impulse control issues			0
he 's after an envelope that @entity18 is delivering downtown -- it really does n't matter why -- and he 's not going to take no for an answer			1
frankly , i 'd have liked to have spent more time with this unhinged brother to the " bad lieutenant			0
" i mean , who did n't wish the @entity26 got his bird just once ? @entity5 , who also wrote the screenplay with @entity62 , ramps up the velocity with low camera angles , speeded - up photography and a rag - bag of digital add - ons			0
@entity18 plots intersections with a kind of mental @entity70 , calculating potential wipeouts and collisions like @entity73 armed with a gps			2
this souped - up visual gimmickry is eye - catching but as empty and artificial as @entity5 's story , which skates over several glaring coincidences and absurdities on what must be the unluckiest day in @entity18 's life			1
it does n't have to be " bicycle thieves , " but a more nuts and bolts approach to physical reality would n't have hurt : fewer impossible jumps , more hard landings			0
i can readily believe that a cyclist could stay a step ahead of a car on @entity20 's crowded streets -- just as well , as the movie is essentially a series of long chase scenes stuck end to end - but a modicum of consistency would be nice			0
one minute , @entity18 is racing hell for leather to evade a bike cop ; the next , he 's parking outside a police station to report the bug - eyed motorist trying to turn him into roadkill			1
probably to satisfy the moneymen , and maybe to spin out his slim 75 - minute story to an hour and a half , @entity5 also throws in a romantic subplot			1
it 's an unnecessary distraction from the business at hand			0
@entity5 shifts backward and forward in time when it suits him , but altogether too much of the romantic sparring takes place on the hands - free as @entity18 and @entity118 ( @entity119 ) hurtle in different directions			1
trust me : that heavy breathing you hear has nothing to do with sex			0
an unpretentious throwback to the kind of action movie that had no need of superheroes , " @entity24 " is hardly a classic but fun up to a point , and it 's a b movie for gearheads with no bells and whistles .			2

" @entity24 " is centered around a group of @entity139 bike messengers
@entity142 's character , @entity18 , appears to have a bit of a death wish
there is also a romantic subplot involving @entity18 and another of the bikers
