-- when the verdict came , it was as dramatic as anyone could have imagined			1
a late saturday night , a courtroom of breathless people , the accused man standing , and finally the words : " we , the jury , find @entity9 not guilty			1
" @entity9 blinked and shook hands with his legal team			2
@entity9 fears for life but outside , the reaction was just beginning			2
in the crowd milling near the court , some chanted , " no justice , no peace , " while others spoke about the disappointment they had dreaded			2
an @entity25 man in a white shirt and gray vest stood with his arm around his young son 's shoulders			1
" i believe that there is a family whose heart was broken , who probably believes once again the system has failed them , " he told @entity0 's @entity31			1
" we 've been praying for both families because we know that it has been a hard time for everybody that 's been involved			1
but as far as justice ... personally , i think that the system failed the @entity44 family			2
" common theme @entity46 erupted in disbelief			2
@entity48 wrote , " what kind of world do we live in where an innocent is killed , and the killer is found innocent ? " @entity53 tweeted , " @entity54 has given a free pass to murder @entity56			1
" a @entity46 user by the name @entity59 echoed a common theme among those frustrated with the decision , " @entity63 innocent ... @entity9 innocent ... @entity64 guilty ... racism			1
" suspected racism in the justice system , deep - seated , secretive and historic , was the crux of the case for millions			0
that was what made it a national story , instead of merely a local tragedy			1
what led jurors to this verdict they did not believe it was just about a 17 - year - old named @entity44 being shot on a rainy night			1
they believed it was about generations of young black men targeted , stalked , suspected and brutalized by police , security guards , neighborhood watches and courts			0
" it 's something bigger because @entity44 is all of our sons			1
he 's the son of all people who are african - american and of those who are conscious of what it means to be black in @entity54 , " said @entity89 , a @entity90 associate professor of history and african - american studies			1
after the verdict , his message was somber			1
" i feel for his parents , " @entity89 said			0
" this is a sad day for democracy and for justice			0
" a much harsher statement came around the same time from another professor who studies race at @entity107 in @entity108			1
" this verdict was prepared from day one , " @entity109 said			1
" from the media campaign of demonizing @entity44 , to the selection of a nonblack jury , to the instruction not to refer to race ... his was the chronicle of an acquittal foretold			1
" on and on the outrage went			0
' tragedy for black families ' reaction was swift , and varied			1
@entity9 could still be held responsible for @entity44 's death @entity122 , an online civil rights group , said it highlighted a deep - seated issue			1
" this is another tragedy for black families			1
the verdict sends a clear message about the minimal value place on the lives of young black men and boys everywhere , " the group said			1
rev. @entity132 also weighed in			0
" the acquittal of @entity9 is a slap in the face to the @entity25 people , " he said			0
not all agree despite the fury and frustration on one side of the verdict , others approved the jury 's decision			1
" the actual case against @entity9 was weak			0
jurors should be commended for making the right call , " @entity146 columnist and author , @entity148 , wrote on @entity46			0
does n't mean @entity9 is ' innocent			0
' " @entity153 tweeted , " @entity151 is , the evidence proved @entity9 not guilty			0
" @entity154 wrote , " there is a reasonable doubt and i think our justice system did what it 's supposed to do			1
" many trial watchers , who suspected it would end this way , argued this case should never have been about race			1
it would be unfair to make @entity9 pay for generations of racial inequalities , no matter how real or painful those troubles may be , some said			0
some suggested it was @entity9 who was being pilloried to placate angry @entity25 - @entity25 voters and others who rallied to make the killing a cause			0
@entity44 's dad : my heart is broken , my faith is not two narratives defense attorney @entity182 , even while speaking highly of the civil rights movement , said if his client had been black , " he never would have been charged with a crime			1
it certainly would never have happened if he were black because those people who decided they were going to make him the scapegoat would not have			0
" his partner at the defense table , attorney @entity191 said , " i think the prosecution of @entity9 was disgraceful			0
it makes me sad ... that it took this long under these circumstances to finally get justice			0
" reconciling the two wildly disparate views of this trial is not easy			0
as legal analysts noted in the months leading up to the testimony , so many people made it so clear they saw the killing in substantially different ways			0
to one side , @entity9 was at worst an overzealous citizen just trying to make sure his neighborhood was safe			2
to the other , he was a gun - toting predator , hunting , harassing and provoking a fatal fight with an innocent teen			0
to one side , @entity44 was little more than a child returning home after getting a snack			2
to the other , he was a hulking young man who could have gone inside , talked with @entity9 or called the police , but instead decided to attack with his fists and paid with his life			0
a recap of the trial , verdict and since people on both sides seemed to have decided the case before the testimony was heard , the verdict was bound to be disturbing no matter how it tilted			2
simply put , preconceived notions effectively had people watching two different trials , with every bit of testimony and evidence producing different , and often opposing , reactions in those dueling audiences			0
@entity238 state attorney @entity237 , while standing with the disappointed prosecution team , seemed to tip her hat to that reality			0
" i never could quite understand people , even people with law degrees , who had not read all of the police reports , who had not read all of the witness statements , yet who came up with opinions one way or the other , " she said			0
but that is what happened			0
it director who raised questions about case is fired " a race war in @entity54 is sadly alive and well , " conservative radio host @entity255 says			1
he 's frustrated with the many celebrities , sports figures , and activists expressing outrage			2
" these people do not care about the facts or respect the law			0
they want their form of justice and , more importantly , added fame that commenting on this case can bring			0
these ' professionals ' are race baiting to gain a more loyal following			2
" with the verdict , the winning side felt that justice was served			1
and the other ? @entity90 's @entity89 summed up his thoughts			2
" like @entity44 's father , my heart is broken			2
i am sad to say that i expected this verdict , " he said			2
" there is much to love about our country , but there are also things that happen to black people every day that make you want to put your head down and cry			0
" verdict does n't end debate in @entity44 's death			1

@entity292 : " a race war in @entity54 is sadly alive and well , " radio host @entity255 says
the race factor propelled it into a national story
without the race issue , it would have been merely a local tragedy
despite the frustration on one side of the verdict , others approved of the jury 's decision
