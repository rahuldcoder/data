-- the @entity3 is set to certify that the @entity2 military is prepared to accept openly gay and lesbian service members , and doing so will not harm military readiness , a @entity2 official told @entity0 on thursday			1
according to the official , who spoke on condition of not being identified , an announcement of that certification -- which is required to repeal the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy -- is likely to come friday			2
under a bill passed last year that set up a process for repealing the controversial policy , defense secretary @entity12 and @entity14 chairman adm. @entity13 , along with president @entity11 , have to sign a certification that confirms the military 's ability to accept the integration of openly gay and lesbian troops			1
even after certification , there will be a 60 - day waiting period before the repeal is fully implemented			2
in a statement thursday , one of the leading groups advocating for repeal , @entity27 , said it had expected @entity12 to act on certification after assessing the situation since he succeeded @entity34 as defense secretary on july 1			1
" we are glad to see that just three weeks into his tenure as secretary of defense , he ( @entity12 ) is already confident that this policy change can take place with little or no disruption to military readiness , " said the @entity27 statement			1
repealing the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy would end a convoluted legal battle led by human rights and gay rights groups			0
a gay rights group -- the @entity49 -- had sued over the 18 - year - old ban on openly gay and lesbian members serving in the @entity2 armed forces			1
in september @entity2 district judge @entity53 declared the military 's ban to be unconstitutional and demanded the government immediately stop enforcing it			0
@entity2 officials have been moving ahead with dismantling " do n't ' ask , do n't tell " but had objected to having the courts force the government to officially repeal it			0
the case put the @entity11 administration in an unusual position of supporting a repeal but at the same time filing court motions to prevent it from happening faster than planned			0
last week , a federal appeals court temporarily reinstated the policy , but banned the military services from investigating or discharging anyone under the rule			0
the 9th @entity2 circuit @entity71 in @entity72 issued the order late friday after the @entity11 administration asked it to reconsider its recent order temporarily blocking the policy			0
on thursday , the @entity49 filed a legal challenge to the appellate court 's temporary reinstatement of the policy , arguing that the unconstitutional statute would continue to harm the rights of gay and lesbian service members until it was fully repealed .			2
