@entity0 , @entity1 -- for centuries , the massive sand dunes overlooking the warm waters off the @entity1 east coast have created a majestic scenery , acting as a natural wall between the sea and the land environment			1
lashed by strong winds , the imposing dunes tower above the acacia - dotted landscape , supporting a vibrant ecosystem that thrives along the scenic coastline near the city of @entity0			1
in recent years , mining companies have been eager to dig inside these dunes to extract the valuable minerals they contain			1
at the same time , environmentalists have been campaigning against mining , fighting to keep the dunes pristine and preserve the region 's splendid natural habitat			1
watch : investing in @entity1 's mining sector one mining company operating in the area is @entity30 ( @entity30 )			1
the firm has been extracting minerals from the region 's coastal sand dunes for more than three decades , having set up a massive operation along the shore			1
" these sands are mineralized , " says @entity37 , general manager of mining at @entity30			2
" they 've got a total heavy mineral content in them , which is ilmenite , rutile , zircon , " he explains			0
while carrying its mining operations , the company says it is committed to achieving a high standard of environmental care			2
it has put in place a rehabilitation program that aims to reshape the dunes and bring the forest to its pre-mining state by putting the indigenous plants back into the ground after the extraction process			2
" clearly , this [ mining ] is a large scale operation that 's got significant impact , " says @entity37			1
" what 's important to us is that we can rehabilitate the ground , restore the indigenous forest after we mined it and that the communities around us and the society which we operate receive benefits from being in proximity to this mining area			1
that 's key to our operation			2
" according to @entity30 , the minerals removed from the sand through mining comprise about 5 % of the dunes ' total volume			1
the company stockpiles the topsoil which contains the nutrients , organic debris and plant seeds that are stripped away during mining			2
after the dunes are reshaped , the topsoil is spread over the bare sand in a thin layer , triggering the natural processes that facilitate the recovery of the dunes			1
windbreaks are erected to protect the emerging seedlings from damage and to help in the stabilization of the dune			0

she says the program is being followed by a number of stakeholders , including the @entity103 which conducts studies in the area			0
" there 's a way to lessen the impact and do mining and development @entity110 , " she says			1
" we can prove it [ natural restoration ] is viable			0
it 's a good option			0
" yet , dune mining is being staunchly opposed by many environmentalists who say that the process is damaging the region 's ecosystem			1
environmental lawyer @entity120 is part of a group of eco-activists who successfully blocked dune mining in the area of @entity126 -- north of where @entity30 is currently working -- in the 1990s			0
that area is now a world heritage site			0
@entity120 describes mining operations in the region as " completely destructive			0
" " it 's a major change to the landscape , " he says			0
" the vegetation gets cleared			0
then anything up to 80 meters of dune gets completely mangled up and rehashed			0
they put humpty dumpty back together again and you have this sort of consolation that the shape will be the same			0
" yet , even critics such as @entity120 acknowledge that there are benefits stemming from the post-mining efforts to rehabilitate the ecosystem			0
watch : growing cost of mining gold in @entity1 " i 've got no complaints about that , " he says			1
" not only are they trying very hard , they are producing excellent results , but in my mind it 's too early to proclaim this as a rehabilitation of the dunes back to its natural state			1
" some voices argue that eco-tourism could provide a small but possible alternative to mining , helping local communities generate income and also preserve the ecosystem			1
@entity120 says that eco-tourism has the potential to benefit the area but warns that its development should take into consideration the sensitivity of the local environment			0
" we need to think ahead -- if we 're promoting eco-tourism as an opportunity and form of development , then we 've got to apply all the same controls and look at it critically , like the mining operation , " he says			2
" eco-tourism does have the advantage provided its beneficiaries are local			0
now i 'm talking about everybody -- owners of resorts , people employed , skills development is very important because these tourism ventures are located in areas where people lack capacity and skills			0
" so unless you link tourism in other community - based initiatives and end up having these ventures and all the benefits living in community , eco-tourism has potential to be just as bad as we perceive mining to be			2

some argue that eco-tourism can be a valuable alternative to mining
