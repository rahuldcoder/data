@entity0 -- a bipartisan group of senators on monday introduced a plan for overhauling @entity6 immigration policy a day before president @entity7 was to lay out his plan			1
the eight senators say their plan will secure the border and provide a path to citizenship some undocumented immigrants already in the country			2
critics say the citizenship component is granting amnesty for those who entered the country illegally			0
immigration plan : a new era of bipartisanship or a political necessity ? here are some frequently asked questions on immigration reform : q : what 's behind this latest immigration reform plan ? a : the new push for immigration reform follows devastating poll results for @entity33 presidential nominee @entity32 , who in november won just 27 % of the @entity35 vote			1
that 's down from 44 % for president @entity37 in 2004 and 31 % for sen. @entity38 four years ago			0
the dramatic slide jolted key republicans to act quickly on the complex and emotional issue that has divided the parties for years			0
republicans long have argued that @entity35 voters , many of whom are catholic and pro-life , would find a home in the @entity33 if not for the harsh rhetoric some @entity33 use to debate illegal immigration			2
@entity50 also are under pressure to reach a deal			0
many @entity35 voters were disappointed that president @entity7 did n't work harder in his first term to pass a bill			1
immediately after his election , @entity35 leaders pushed the president to make sure it would be a priority for his second term			2
as a signal of how important the issue is for @entity50 , senate majority leader @entity62 announced last week an immigration reform bill would be labeled s - 1 , meaning it 's @entity50 bill no. 1 of the new @entity68 -- and clearly a top priority			1
why this time ? q : why did the senators announce their plan the day before @entity7 was to present his ? a : the senators decided to unveil their plan ahead of the president in order to give their proposal -- and the entire reform effort -- a bipartisan tone , something they believe is critical to winning passage in the @entity50 and @entity82 , according to sources familiar with the bipartisan @entity50 framework			1
in fact , at a private @entity82 meeting friday , some senior @entity86 members of the @entity87 pushed the @entity82 to hold off introducing its own legislative language out of fear that the specifics , as spelled out by a @entity86 president , could upset the delicate bipartisan balance the negotiators had reached			2
why the time may be right q : will there be enough support in the @entity82 for this plan ? a : it 's unclear because many @entity82 conservatives have opposed allowing undocumented workers an opportunity to gain @entity6 citizenship			1
this controversial issue could prove to be a real test for @entity82 speaker @entity109 's leadership because it splits the @entity82 @entity33 conference			2
if the @entity50 is able to pass a bill , the speaker could again be faced with a decision whether to bring up a measure that has significant @entity86 support but potentially only a minority within his own ranks			2
or @entity109 could decide to move a separate @entity82 immigration plan			0
@entity109 was noncommittal when the details of the @entity50 were unveiled			0
his spokesman put out a brief statement not taking a position , but pointing out @entity123 @entity122 sen. @entity122 , who is popular with conservatives , was part of the group drafting the plan			0
" the speaker welcomes the work of leaders like senator @entity122 on this issue , and is looking forward to learning more about the proposal in the coming days , " @entity109 spokesman @entity128 told @entity1			0
there are also bipartisan discussions going on in the @entity82 on immigration , but one @entity86 aide familiar with the discussions told @entity1 of that effort , " it 's not quite ripe yet			1
" but in a speech last week , @entity109 signaled the @entity82 would act , saying , " it 's time to deal with it			0
i said it the day after the election , i meant it			0
we 're going to have to deal with it			0
" @entity109 also alluded to the @entity82 bipartisan talks , not giving any details , but saying the group was " in my view the right group of members			0
" he also added , " my theory was if these folks can work this out it would be a big step in the right direction			0
" but already , some @entity82 @entity33 are dismissing the most controversial piece of the @entity50 plan to allow a path to citizenship as " amnesty " illustrating the challenge to get a deal through the @entity82			1
@entity169 @entity168 rep. @entity168 put out a statement on monday arguing " by granting amnesty , the @entity50 proposal actually compounds the problem by encouraging more illegal immigration			0
" by the numbers : immigration and naturalization q : could any of the @entity50 plan be a starting point for compromise with the @entity82 ? a : many @entity82 @entity33 have called for strengthening border security , and insist that issue be the top priority before any steps are taken to grant citizenship to those in the @entity6 illegally			1
but the bipartisan immigration framework from the @entity50 ties the two issues together to attract support from both parties			1
if @entity82 @entity33 attempt to separate these it could up jeopardize the chance for comprehensive immigration reform			1
the new @entity50 framework also includes a component that the @entity33 - led @entity82 already addressed last year -- it awards green cards for those foreigners at @entity6 universities studying science , technology , engineering and mathematics , to encourage them to stay and work in the @entity6			1
@entity82 @entity33 passed a bill establishing so - called " @entity204 " visas last fall , but it was largely opposed by @entity50 because it canceled another visa program .			1

push to get immigration reform through @entity68 shows power of @entity35 vote in last election
@entity62 says immigration reform bill would be labeled @entity214 , the @entity50 's first bill in the new @entity68
senators announced their bill ahead of @entity7 to try to convey a bipartisan tone to their effort
*outlook* in the @entity82 is iffy -- some conservatives do n't agree with path to citizenship
