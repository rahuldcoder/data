-- superstorm @entity1 inflicted havoc and heartache throughout the @entity5 , hitting the @entity6 and its surrounding coastal towns hard			1
we have seen this kind of destruction before : i had an up - close - and personal view when @entity13 ravaged @entity14 and the @entity15			2
on august 31 , 2005 , i was designated commander of @entity17 , responsible for coordinating military relief efforts for damaged areas across the @entity15			0
my arrival in @entity14 came after what was widely believed to be a poor performance by the @entity23 and its director @entity24			2
we learned a lot about what really works in our @entity13 recovery efforts -- but @entity28 and @entity29 seem to be ignoring those lessons			1
first , i would like to praise the search and rescue operations in @entity28 and @entity29			2
but they could be doing much better now that they 've entered the difficult part , the recovery operation			0
where is the command center ? who is in charge ? where is the @entity42 ? during the aftermath of @entity13 , @entity42 troops were positioned on every block to establish a sense of safety and source of help for the people in need			1
they did not leave communities till people were safe and sound			0
this has not happened in @entity28 or @entity29			2
opinion : rebuilding after @entity1 is too big a risk the @entity42 has served @entity58 as both a wartime force and the first military responders in times of domestic crisis			1
hundreds of times each year , the nation 's governors call upon their guard troops to respond to fires , floods , hurricanes and other natural disasters			0
why did @entity28 gov. @entity72 only call in half the @entity73 , especially when relief is still not reaching the severely affected communities ? the numbers speak for themselves			2
during the @entity13 disaster , about 20,000 federal troops were mobilized ; 20 ships , including a hospital ship , about 50,000 @entity42 members and 200 helicopters assisted in the relief efforts			1
so far , in @entity1 relief efforts , about 11,000 @entity42 troops were deployed , and only two ships have assisted -- this as people still suffer			1
map : see images of destruction , recovery across the @entity93 instead of @entity96 providing health care to about 300 people in @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 , @entity29 , why was n't the hospital ship @entity95 deployed like it was in @entity13 , when it cared for needy people all along the @entity15 ? opinion : what 's next after the superstorm ? people need food and medical attention			1
people are still without power , people are still homeless and hungry			0
following a logistics model to help those hardest hit is a necessity			0
@entity28 and @entity29 need to establish what is called an " enabler " model for recovery , which we developed during @entity13			1
in this approach , you go in with @entity125 troops and you distribute food , water and medicine , but you also pick up trash , clean out sewer pipes , clean up hospitals , hook up generators , all in order to enable people to live in their communities			0
troops should stay in communities until residents get everything they need to live in their homes , or till they can be evacuated			0
@entity28 went in with food and rescue teams -- but in many cases , community volunteers were left to take up the slack			0
news : @entity23 's answers for @entity28 storm victims -- put them back in their homes some @entity23 officials complain that they must drive hours every day to get to the storm victims because @entity28 has not provided them with any living accommodations			1
what 's needed urgently are more disaster recovery offices in every community , where @entity23 representatives can stay			2
people can easily apply for assistance , food stamps , grants for rebuilding or get food and water			0
this is especially urgent in @entity28 , as poorer communities are at their most vulnerable now , with cold weather coming on and infrastructure still damaged			0
@entity1 was one of the most vicious storm systems to hit the @entity28 area in nearly two centuries			1
the city seems to be treating the storm more like an inconvenience than a disaster			0
@entity13 offered great lessons for successful recovery operations -- why did n't @entity28 pay attention ? the opinions in this commentary are solely those of lt. gen. @entity179 .			1

lt. gen. @entity179 asks why @entity28 has ignored all the lessons learned from @entity13
@entity179 : @entity1 recovery has no command center , nobody in charge and no troop presence
after @entity13 , @entity42 was out in force and hospital ship was available , he says
@entity23 workers complain they have difficulty reaching @entity1 storm victims , he says
