-- images believed to be of @entity3 's next generation of military air power have been buzzing around the internet , but @entity7 officials are insisting it does not mean @entity3 has matched @entity9 air capabilities			1
the new @entity3 stealth fighter jet , known as the @entity11 , is n't supposed to be operational until at least 2017 , but a @entity3 air force commander told @entity3 tv in 2009 that flight testing would begin much sooner			1
stealth jets , such as the @entity9 ' @entity16 , are designed to evade detection by radar and anti-aircraft defenses			1
now unknown sources have posted photos of what appears to be the plane on an airfield runway in southwestern @entity3			2
" we are aware of their plans to develop this fifth - generation fighter , " @entity7 spokesman col. @entity25 said wednesday			1
" the photos that were released recently are presumably of some taxi testing			0
" at a thursday briefing , @entity3 foreign ministry spokesman @entity31 declined to comment on reports on @entity3 testing the jet			1
" @entity3 insists on a path of peaceful development , " he said			2
" we have adopted a national defense policy that is defensive in nature and do not threaten any other countries			0
@entity3 has been an important force in maintaining regional and global peace			2
" the emergence of the photos comes as defense secretary @entity45 heads to @entity3 this weekend to discuss the military relationship between the @entity9 and @entity3			1
and later this month , president @entity47 will go to @entity48 for a summit with president @entity50			0
one @entity3 watcher says @entity53 's failure to censor the grainy images on the web proves the photos are of the new jet and the country wants them to circulate			1
" the @entity3 military and the police could have swept the area around the airfield very easily , but what they 've done is they 've controlled this			2
they 've allowed @entity3 to only take photos with cell phones , meaning that the photos that we have are low - resolution , do not give us a great deal of detail about the aircraft and they 're put on the web with a low - resolution format , " said @entity3 military scholar and author @entity64			1
" the response within @entity3 has been overwhelmingly positive and has spurred national pride to an enormous degree			2
" the @entity7 is taking a low - key approach to the surge in publicity about the @entity3 fighter , saying their existing top - of - the - line warplane has engine problems and that their next plane is years away			1
but @entity64 says that timeline could be sped up if the @entity3 buy an engine from @entity88 as opposed to developing it themselves			2
" it 's something that is in some form of development , as a fifth - generation fighter			0
as i noted , the @entity3 are still having difficulties with their fourth - generation fighter , " @entity25 said in an off - camera question session with journalists in his office			2
and he said that while the new jet was not mentioned in the @entity7 report on @entity3 that was sent to @entity102 in august as an annual update for @entity3 's defense capabilities , the @entity7 has talked about it			1
" we as a department have publicly spoken about it in the past			0
it is not as if we have not acknowledged that they are pursuing a fifth - generation fighter , " @entity25 said			0
" so we are aware of it			0
but it is not of concern that they are working on a fifth - generation fighter			0
" @entity64 , however , says it should be a concern , citing the @entity3 jet 's potential ability to overtake that of @entity9 's f - 22 in thrust and " supercruise " speed , which is the ability to fly supersonically without using fuel - guzzling afterburners			1
" we ca n't say precisely what the capabilities are , but we have a good idea			0
right now , we should be reviving production of the @entity16 and not just reviving production , we should be developing an advance version of the @entity16 , " said @entity64			0
" and sadly , even though it is a troubled program , already the @entity134 needs another rework			0
it needs to be made competitive with this fighter			0
" the @entity16 was scaled back in production in 2009			0
the production of the @entity134 , which is being developed and tested , could be slowed under @entity45 ' budget - cutting initiative			0
in 2009 , @entity45 said that no nation comes close to the @entity9 ' air power , and he anticipated the @entity3 having only " a handful " of fighters that challenge the @entity9 advanced fleets by 2025			1
but @entity64 cautions that this @entity3 jet could cause a change in the balance of power in the @entity150			1
" since @entity152 , the @entity9 military has never gone into battle without the assurance of air superiority			1
@entity3 is a rising power , and it is determined to challenge the @entity9 position globally , " said @entity64			1
" this fighter will allow them to do that on a military level ... and from my perspective , that 's simply unacceptable			0
" @entity0 's @entity165 in @entity53 contributed to this report .			0

grainy web images of what is believed to be a new @entity3 fighter jet create a stir
known as the @entity11 , stealth fighter is n't supposed to be operational until at least 2017
a @entity7 spokesman says the @entity9 is aware of situation , but it is n't *fretful* about it
a military scholar says the development is a threat to @entity9 military superiority in the @entity150
