@entity0 -- when thousands of children fled violence and poverty in @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 and surged toward the borders of other nations , it was seen as a humanitarian crisis and they were considered refugees			1
but a huge influx of young migrants from @entity18 , many telling @entity15 workers they are trying to escape drug cartels , gang violence , murder and rape as they stream across the southern border , have so far not been conveyed the same status			1
the contrast in what politicians on both sides of the aisle and others have characterized as a humanitarian crisis has introduced new complexity to @entity18 's toxic debate on immigration			1
the @entity15 high commissioner for refugees is pushing for the @entity36 , @entity37 , and @entity18 countries to treat many of the children as " refugees , " which could prompt more from @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 to seek asylum			1
however , the @entity46 has said most wo n't qualify as refugees to stay in the country			1
" we do n't want to send people back into harm 's way ... but the more they expand access to asylum , the more people will feel they have a case , " said @entity48 , a senior associate for regional security for @entity50 , a nonprofit humanitarian organization			0
different approaches president @entity61 wants $ 3.7 billion from @entity62 to help address the problem			0
the emergency money would go to detention facilities for housing children while they await hearings and for legal aid to help sift through a backlog of immigration cases			2
there is no appetite for @entity61 's plan among @entity74 in @entity62			0
one of them , @entity77 sen. @entity76 , said it would perpetuate the crisis			0
others said it 's too expensive and it would be cheaper to simply fly the kids home			0
a bipartisan measure by @entity74 sen. @entity85 and @entity87 rep. @entity86 , both of @entity89 , aims to quickly send most young migrants home by changing a 2008 law that now requires all unaccompanied minors who are n't from @entity37 or @entity93 to receive a hearing before deportation			0
the plan , which may have wider support , troubles some lawmakers , especially those in the @entity100 , who worry that children who could possibly qualify for asylum wo n't have time to properly plead their cases			0
" you ca n't in 72 hours go ahead and make the case that your father got murdered in front of you			0
you ca n't make the case that the gang said ' join us or die , ' if you do n't have the time to produce documents , affidavits , certificates and what not			0
and so it is unacceptable to me to basically have a deal that undermines all those rights , " said sen. @entity118 , a @entity119 @entity74			0
a word loaded with political implications there is important nuance and distinction in calling the surge a " humanitarian crisis " while steering clear of deeming the migrants " refugees , " international policy and humanitarian aid experts say			1
the difference determines who gets asylum and who goes back			0
what 's the difference between immigrant and refugee ? it 's a difference the @entity15 is pressing @entity0 to reconsider			2
" we recognize the enormous challenges facing the @entity36 and other countries as a result of this large movement of people , " @entity143 , the @entity15 refugees commission regional representative in the @entity36 , said in a statement advocating broader refugee status			1
" we 're witnessing a complex situation in which children are leaving home for a variety of reasons , including poverty , the desire to join family , and the growing influence of trafficking networks			0
within this movement , there are also children who are fleeing situations of violence at the hands of transnational organized criminal groups and powerful local gangs , " @entity143 said			2
@entity171 , an international migration professor at @entity172 and the author of several books on humanitarian crises , said @entity36 law is ambiguous as to whether the children in this case " meet the definition of a refugee			1
" humanitarian crisis ... in @entity18 ? they would have to prove they fear persecution on the basis of their race , religion , nationality , political perspectives or membership in a particular social group , @entity182 said			1
violent threats , the type many have apparently told @entity15 workers they face from drug cartels and gangs at home , are n't always enough to qualify for asylum , immigration legal scholars and humanitarian aid workers said			1
humanitarian aid groups argue the level of violence by organized crime syndicates in @entity42 , @entity44 and @entity43 is so high that the children are basically fleeing warfare			2
however , some anti-immigration groups have argued that by helping the minors , the @entity36 government is actually aiding cartels profiting from smuggling			2
the @entity61 administration has said it is approaching the situation as a humanitarian crisis and there is no need , beyond a monitoring role , for the @entity15 to get involved			1
the @entity220 will conduct interviews with the kids and their legal representatives to determine who might be deemed " refugees			2
" unintended consequences : 2008 anti-trafficking law contributes to border crisis " obviously , we 're -- we have a far different circumstance than , say , @entity7 , " @entity232 spokeswoman @entity231 told reporters earlier this month the situation was " far different " than similar migrant outflows in @entity7 and other conflict zones			2
typically , she said , the @entity15 refugee agency " conducts these interviews in countries where the host government is not capable or willing to conduct these interviews			2
and obviously , the @entity36 -- that 's a process that we undergo ourselves			2
" the witch 's brew : desperation , hope and children on the border but the problem is a hydra and will be difficult for federal officials to stem the tide , @entity249 , a @entity1 contributor , wrote recently			0
most wo n't be allowed to stay @entity46 spokesman @entity255 has said the children who have been detained " will go through the immigration court process " and it 's unlikely that most who do so " will qualify " for asylum to stay in the country			1
" in the view of this @entity46 , an immigration judge should make the determination about whether someone qualified for refugee status , " @entity255 told reporters on wednesday			2
there 's the matter of perception , @entity182 said , adding that terms such as " refugee " engender sympathy in a way " immigrant " might not			0
for some people , the image of " kids being queue - jumpers " raises hackles , she added			0
" as to why @entity36 are more favorably inclined to aid those who are in need of protection elsewhere than those in their back yard , i think that ambivalence about immigration begins to override the humanitarian instinct when people are seeking to enter the country , " @entity182 said			1
those feelings are reflected in the emotionally - charged protests that have sprung up in such places as @entity294 , @entity295 , and @entity296 , @entity77 , and polls			0
one released this week by the @entity298 found that 53 % of @entity36 surveyed supports expediting the legal process for the @entity18 immigrant children even if it results in kids who could have received asylum being deported			1
a @entity304 poll also released this week showed 58 % of @entity36 surveyed disapprove of @entity61 's handling of the situation			0
@entity89 governor lashes out at @entity61 over immigration crisis still , some political analysts and humanitarian groups have been stunned by the level of political vitriol and lack of broader public outcry			1
" there 's no big outcry , " demanding these kids stay in the @entity36 , @entity48 said , adding that this is surprising since this is " the worst humanitarian crisis in the @entity321			1
" @entity1 senior political analyst @entity322 likened the calls for mass deportation to a boat of @entity327 refugees who sought safety in @entity18 as @entity329 loomed			1
they too , @entity322 said , faced political backlash in an anti-immigration climate and were sent back to @entity333 where one - third of them were killed by @entity335			0
" seventy - five years later , we are faced with a new group of desperate people hovering in our midst -- this time children from @entity18 escaping escalating levels of violence few of us can fathom , " @entity322 wrote in an op - ed for @entity1			1
" while certainly no @entity348 , the growing humanitarian crisis in their home countries is glaring as rising murder rates for youths are a driving force behind the mass exodus			1
how will we respond this time ? " @entity322 asked			0
7 questions : immigration next steps ?			0

there is an important political distinction in calling the surge of migrant children " refugees "
partisan *bickering* over immigration is part of why @entity36 is *reluctant* to coalesce on the issue
@entity15 , humanitarian groups want @entity18 immigrant kids treated as refugees
@entity46 calls it humanitarian crisis and approaches it with immigration - related solutions
