@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity0 's banned @entity4 will apply to become a political party , it announced tuesday			1
@entity19 " envisions the establishment of a democratic , civil state that draws on universal measures of freedom and justice , with central @entity14 values serving all @entity0 regardless of colour , creed , political trend or religion , " it said in the statement			2
although officially illegal , the @entity4 is regarded as one of the most organized groups in @entity0			2
it has said it does not plan to run a candidate for president when elections are held to replace @entity26 , who resigned on friday			1
although officially illegal , the @entity4 is regarded as one of the most organized groups in @entity0			2
experts estimate the group has the support of anywhere from 10 % to 30 % of the population			1
it has said it does not plan to run a candidate for president when elections are held to replace @entity26 , who resigned on friday			1
the group has sparked great controversy in the @entity39 , where some see it as a non-violent , @entity14 social welfare organization supportive of a democratic process while others call it a radical extremist group hellbent on creating a theocracy in @entity0			1
president @entity47 recently downplayed the prospect of the @entity4 playing a major role in @entity0 , saying it is just one faction in @entity0 that does n't have majority support			1
" there are a whole bunch of secular folks in @entity0 , there are a whole bunch of educators and civil society in @entity0 that want to come to the fore as well , " the president said in an interview with @entity55			1
" and it 's important for us not to say that our only two options are either the @entity4 or a suppressed @entity0 people			2
" others , however , distrust the @entity4 's ultimate intentions			0
" they are a powerful force at present , but my fear is that @entity77 groups outside @entity0 , seeing the opportunity in the current chaos , will flood them with support if they back an extremist view , " said @entity2 national security contributor @entity70 , who was president @entity73 's counterterrorism advisor			1
and former cia director @entity83 said the @entity4 , as the best organized opposition group in @entity0 , could " enjoy a disproportionate power in shaping the new government			1
the question is : will it become more radical ? " still , a current @entity39 official characterized the @entity4 as being " not as extreme as @entity90 is			1
" " it 's an organization that supports a civil state which is based in large part on @entity14 law , " said the official			1
" but they do tend to eschew violence and work within the political process			0
" the official cautioned about ambiguity when it comes to @entity0			0
" there are lots of unknowns now with @entity0 , " said the official			0
" you really ca n't make a call on anything , whether @entity26 is going or staying or how the @entity4 figures into the political process			0
and in a recent article in the @entity110 , former @entity108 analyst @entity107 wrote that @entity39 should not fear the group			1
" they should not be afraid of the @entity4			0
living with it wo n't be easy , but it should not be seen as inevitably our enemy , " said @entity112			0
the @entity117 was founded in 1928 to oppose @entity119 control of @entity0 with its goal the creation of an independent @entity14 state			0
although it allegedly engaged in assassination and other violence against the @entity119 and supported the coup that brought @entity126 to power in 1952 , the @entity4 has been illegal since 1954 , when it was convicted of attempting to assassinated @entity126 , charges the group denied			1
@entity126 ruthlessly suppressed the group , and his successors , @entity131 and @entity26 , continued the repression			1
the @entity4 subsequently renounced violence , is engaged in providing social services to the populace , opposes the peace treaty with @entity137 and supports democratic elections			0
on its @entity140 website , the @entity117 calls for establishing an @entity14 state in accordance with the provision of @entity14 @entity145 law			0
@entity146 , a senior fellow at the @entity147 , said the @entity4 " ought to be a welcomed force within @entity0 politics " if it accepts full rights for women and for religious minorities			0
but his colleague at the council , @entity156 , said the group has n't done that , pointing to statements by the @entity4 that neither a woman nor a @entity159 could ever lead @entity0			2
but @entity161 congresswoman @entity161 of @entity162 worried that the government did not see the danger			0
" i 'm very concerned that they 're using the peaceful protests in @entity0 for a power grab and that we in the government does n't seem -- we do n't seem to grasp that threat in the way it concerns me , " she said at a congressional hearing last week			0
" @entity19 is n't a danger just because they 're terrorists , but because they push an extremist ideology that causes others to commit acts of terrorism			0
" ' the 83 - year - old organization has never been placed on the @entity181 's list of terrorist organizations and officially renounced violence in the 1970s			1
the organization was a minor player in the demonstrations that toppled @entity26			2
but the @entity39 chief intelligence officer raised a stir when he referred to the @entity117 as a " largely secular " organization in response to a question from @entity161 at the hearing			1
" the term ' @entity4 ' is an umbrella term for a variety of movements , in the case of @entity0 , a very heterogeneous group , largely secular , which has eschewed violence and has decried @entity90 as a perversion of @entity14 , " said @entity193 , the director of national intelligence			2
" they have pursued social ends , a betterment of the political order in @entity0			0
" @entity193 's office later clarified the director 's comments			0
" in @entity0 the @entity4 makes efforts to work through a political system that has been , under @entity26 's rule , one that is largely secular in its orientation -- ( @entity193 ) is well aware that the @entity4 is not a secular organization			2
" @entity2 's @entity215 contributed to this report			0
