@entity0 -- @entity5 's prime minister @entity4 will learn the fate of a controversial law that would shield him from prosecution on thursday , the country 's @entity2 said tuesday			1
the court heard arguments tuesday about the legality of the " legitimate impediment " law , which would effectively grant top @entity5 government officials immunity while they are in office			1
the @entity4 - backed law says top government officials can not be prosecuted because their officials duties make it impossible for them to attend court hearings			1
the law would suspend criminal trials until the official leaves office			0
the law was approved in march 2010 , but prosecutors in @entity29 challenged the constitutionality of the measure , saying it should be judges , not politicians , who determined whether someone had time to attend court			1
two separate trials against @entity4 are pending , and a third one is in the works			1
he 's accused of bribing a witness to commit perjury in one case , and of tax fraud and other financial irregularities in another			0
both trials began but were suspended when the immunity law was passed			2
@entity4 has called the charges politically motivated			0
a third case against the prime minister , also related to tax fraud , is in preliminary stages			0
@entity4 has been tried on at least 17 separate charges since first taking office as prime minister in 1994 , but remains very popular with the @entity5 public			2
the immunity law was due to expire 18 months after it was passed , which would make it expire in october			0
the @entity2 can rule it is unconstitutional and strike it down , uphold it , or rule it partially unconstitutional and modify it , @entity5 media reported .			0

@entity4 's government passed a law *protecting* officials from prosecution
prosecutors challenged it on constitutional grounds
@entity4 was *facing* two separate prosecutions when the law was passed
