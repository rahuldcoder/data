@entity0 -- the co-author of a study on propofol addiction funded by @entity5 and used in their defense in the @entity9 wrongful death trial lost his medical license for writing illegal drug prescriptions , according to testimony			1
dr. @entity13 was hired to help with the @entity5 study after he lost his job at a pizza parlor and took a job driving a goodwill truck , said dr. @entity19 , who testified wednesday as an expert witness for the concert promoter			1
@entity13 was " destitute , dead broke , and i wanted to help him , " @entity19 , himself a recovering heroin addict , testified			1
the revelation was a bizarre twist in the trial of the billion - dollar lawsuit filed by @entity9 's mother and three children , which is being heard by a @entity0 jury			2
the four - month - long trial is nearing a conclusion			2
@entity5 lawyers will announce if they have any more witnesses to call before playing the video depositions of three more doctors on friday			2
@entity9 lawyers would then take several days to call rebuttal witnesses before closing arguments are heard , which is likely to happened around september 23			0
@entity19 testified that he never disclosed to @entity5 lawyers that his co-author had lost his medical license			1
ironically , the company is being accused of the negligent hiring of dr. @entity47 , convicted in @entity9 's death because it allegedly failed to check @entity47 's background before hiring him			2
@entity9 lawyer @entity50 also grilled @entity19 over his nondisclosure that he was working as a paid consultant in @entity5 's defense when he submitted the study for publication in a medical journal			1
he said the concert promoter did not try to influence his findings , which were published in march in the @entity59			0
nurse details @entity9 's fatal search for sleep @entity9 lawyers are hoping the controversy over @entity19 's work for @entity5 will distract jurors from his conclusion that @entity9 was a drug addict with a " grave prognosis " that would have shortened his life had he not died of an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol on june 25 , 2009			1
each dose of an anesthetic his doctor gave him to help him sleep was like playing " @entity76 roulette , " @entity19 said			0
@entity47 told investigators he gave @entity9 infusions of propofol for 60 nights to treat his insomnia as the entertainer prepared for his comeback concerts			2
lawyers for the concert promoter hired @entity19 in their effort to downplay damages the company might have to pay if found liable in the pop icon 's death			1
how much longer @entity9 might have lived -- and earned money touring -- will be important if the jury decides @entity5 is liable for damages in @entity9 's death			1
@entity9 lawyers contend he would have earned more than $ 1.5 billion touring the world over the next several years			0
@entity96 and her three grandchildren sued @entity9 's last concert promoter , contending the company is liable in his death because it hired , retained or supervised the doctor convicted of involuntary manslaughter			1
@entity5 lawyers contend it was @entity9 , not the promoter , who chose and controlled @entity47 , and say @entity5 executives had no way of knowing about the dangerous treatments the doctor was giving @entity9 in the privacy of his bedroom			2
@entity9 's mom remembers her ' sweet little boy ' @entity19 : @entity9 went ' doctor shopping ' despite writing a blog six weeks after @entity9 's death titled " @entity9 : addiction in the @entity117 , " @entity19 testified tuesday that there " was insufficient evidence that he was addicted to propofol			1
" " he was given propofol initially for appropriate medical procedures , but at some point , he began seeking out physicians who would administer propofol to him , " @entity19 testified			0
the last two instances of " doctor shopping " for propofol were late march and april of 2009 , when @entity9 asked an anesthesiologist to go on tour with him and then asked a nurse to help him find an anesthesiologist , he said			0
@entity19 said there was no evidence @entity9 's search for a doctor to give him propofol continued after @entity5 co-ceo @entity134 sent an e-mail to the singer 's assistant on may 6 , 2009 , telling him @entity47 had agreed to take the job as his personal physician for the " @entity141 " tour			1
" done at $ 150k a month , " @entity134 wrote			0
" sounds like he got it , " @entity19 testified			0
the @entity144 's lawyers contend that @entity5 executives ignored warning signs that @entity9 's health began deteriorating after @entity47 began attending to him on a daily basis			1
show workers sent e-mails describing a paranoid and frail @entity9 who could n't perform his standard dances or remember words to songs he had sung for decades			0
a @entity155 sleep expert , testifying in june for the @entity156 , concluded that the 60 nights of propofol infusions apparently robbed @entity9 of rapid eye movement sleep , which is vital to keep the brain and body alive			2
" the symptoms that mr. @entity9 was exhibiting were consistent with what someone might expect to see of someone suffering from total sleep deprivation over a chronic period , " dr. @entity162 testified			0
@entity5 expert : @entity9 was a drug addict expert 's conflict ? soon after @entity5 's lawyers hired @entity19 as a consultant on propofol addiction in 2011 , they agreed to fund his scientific research , which resulted in his paper titled " addiction to @entity179 : a study of 22 treatment cases			1
" the @entity182 published the study in march			0
@entity19 insisted in his testimony that @entity5 's funding did not influence the conclusions of his study or his testimony in the trial			1
but the @entity9 lawyer hammered the doctor about the lack of disclosure to the scientific journal and his collaborator that he was being paid to be an expert witness in the trial			0
he informed them that he was doing research for the company , but the trial aspect was " irrelevant , " @entity19 said			0
" it 's irrelevant to health care professionals , " he said			0
" it would n't affect their understanding of the paper			0
