@entity0 -- a day after @entity3 mayor @entity2 rankled the administration of @entity6 gov. @entity5 with allegations that his office withheld @entity10 relief funding over her refusal to push through a redevelopment project , @entity2 now says the threat was " a direct message from the governor			1
" " it 's stunning			0
but it 's true , " @entity2 told @entity1 's @entity18 in an interview sunday morning			0
later in the day , she released a statement saying that she had met with the @entity22 for several hours at its request and provided the office with her journal and other documents			1
" as they pursue this investigation , i will provide any requested information and testify under oath about the facts of what happened when the lieutenant governor came to @entity3 and told me that @entity10 aid would be contingent on moving forward with a private development project , " she said			1
@entity2 appeared on @entity37 on saturday to level charges that members of @entity5 's administration pressured her to approve a redevelopment project sought by @entity42 , a real estate developer with ties to the governor 's office			1
@entity2 said lt. gov. @entity47 made the threat on behalf of @entity5 at a may 13 event they both attended in @entity3			1
later recording the conversation in a journal entry she shared with @entity1 , @entity2 recalled the lieutenant governor warned her she had " to move forward with the @entity58 project " and labeled the demand " a direct message from the governor			1
" " she came and made a direct threat to me , " @entity2 said of her conversation with @entity60			2
in light of @entity2 's new claims , a spokesman for the governor 's office , @entity66 , stuck by his initial dismissal of the @entity37 report saturday , saying the mayor 's allegations are nothing more than " partisan politics			2
" " mayor @entity2 's categorization about her conversation in @entity3 is categorically false , " @entity66 told @entity1			1
the @entity3 mayor refuted that characterization			1
" i have n't been a part of the @entity86 machine , " @entity2 said , citing her frequent praise of @entity5 and what she describes as a solid working relationship between the two executives			2
" i did have a really good relationship ( with the governor ) , so i could n't believe they were doing this			2
" " this is wrong			0
this is not fair to @entity3 , " @entity2 added			2
of her conversation with @entity60 , @entity2 told @entity18 she sensed the lieutenant governor felt remorseful for relaying the message that no funds would be given to the city until the @entity42 's project was approved			1
" she felt almost guilty about saying it , " @entity2 said			0
" she knows it 's wrong , " steadfastly clinging to her account , @entity2 predicted that if the matter ultimately gets folded into the ongoing investigation of the @entity105 controversy , @entity60 would confirm her story			0
" if she 's asked to testify under oath , i think we 're going to see the truth come out because i will she be truthful under oath , " @entity2 said			0
@entity2 's claims center around a property owned by @entity115 , which had its plan for " redevelopment " of a three - block area of @entity3 rejected by the city 's planning board			1
instead , the panel voted to classify the area owned by the company as available for " rehabilitation			0
" the " redevelopment " tax incentives offered a much more lucrative deal for the development company			0
in an e-mail to @entity2 , @entity130 , counsel for the @entity42 , lobbied on behalf of the company , asking to speak directly with the mayor regarding the property			0
@entity130 was previously commissioner of the @entity133 for the @entity5 administration			2
asked by @entity18 on sunday why she had not come forward sooner , @entity2 said she was afraid her story -- accusing an overwhelmingly popular governor of the same kind of political corruption he once targeted as a @entity140 attorney -- would have been ignored			0
in a june @entity143 poll , @entity6 voters overwhelmingly approved of @entity5 's job performance , 69 % to 27 %			2
he won re-election in november by a crushing margin over @entity86 challenger @entity148			0
" i did n't think anyone would believe me , " @entity2 said sunday			0
" i probably should have come forward sooner , but i really did n't think anyone would believe me			0
" @entity2 was unequivocal in her allegations the @entity5 administration continues to hold relief funds hostage until she approves the redevelopment project			1
@entity3 was one of the cities hit hardest by the 2012 hurricane , which ravaged the eastern seaboard , destroying an estimated $ 100 million worth of property			2
in its response to @entity2 's charges , @entity5 's office pointed to nearly $ 70 million in federal aid that was approved to help @entity3 in its recovery from the still - visible impact of @entity10 and said more funds are set to be earmarked for the city once the @entity167 approves the next round of funding for the state			1
@entity2 described this claim as a half - truth , telling @entity18 that the $ 70 million @entity173 says the city received is from the federal flood insurance program , not from the pool of cash @entity178 approved specifically to help @entity6 recover from the storm			0
@entity5 took some members of his own party to task when they threatened to deny the state the funds in the name of fiscal responsibility			1
the @entity3 mayor said the governor 's response , thus far , to her claims has danced around the central issue at stake			1
" they did not respond to the no. 1 question : are they linking @entity3 funding to the @entity58 project ? " @entity2 said			1
" the fact is , they are			0
" @entity1 's @entity200 contributed to this report .			0
