-- it is a sunday night in @entity2 , @entity3			2
here on this @entity6 island , and on the others that make up what 's known as the @entity10 , life revolves around one thing -- cricket			1
on this night , locals gather at historic @entity14 , which hosted the 2007 @entity16 final			2
there are no national teams on display this time , but there is a local trophy up for grabs			2
it 's enough to draw a large crowd of boisterous fans			1
in the concourse , a familiar face makes his way through the crowd			2
he is @entity31 , and he is the best to have never played for the @entity10 , all because of one decision he and his teammates made 30 years ago			1
it left each of them -- forever -- branded a rebel			2
in 1983 , the @entity10 cricket team was on top of the world			2
team captain @entity41 , from @entity42 , had led them to back - to - back @entity16 victories in 1975 and ' 79			1
contact ' branded a rebel ' presenter @entity46 on @entity48 overflowing with talent , the islands of the @entity10 could have fielded at least two teams of world - class players			1
but with all the hype and success , money did not follow			1
playing international and club cricket was not enough to earn a living			1
at the same time , a world away , @entity59 was deep in the heart of apartheid			1
its government 's policies had split life into different classifications for whites and so - called non-whites			1
such oppression against the non-white population intensified into violence , landing young protesters like @entity74 in jail			0
thousands more were arrested or killed			0
as the world tried to pressure @entity59 's leadership , sanctions were applied , and sport was no exception			1
in 1970 , the @entity81 banned @entity59 from international competition , leaving the country 's cricket - mad fans deprived of the sport they loved , and their cricketers of the careers they dreamed of			1
" you 're always optimistic , " said former @entity90 cricketer @entity89			0
" the stupidity that existed would change and @entity59 would change much quicker , and we 'd be back playing international sport			1
but it hung on and hung on			0
" ' rebel tours ' to save cricket in @entity59 , the sport 's administrators knew something had to be done			1
so , in secret , they began planning " rebel tours " -- inviting various teams from around the world			0
it was a bold move to defy the @entity81 's ban by offering lucrative contracts			1
in march 1982 , the first rebel team from @entity109 arrived in @entity110			0
" from our point of view , we knew we had the best cricketers in the world , " said former @entity112 president @entity111 , one of the rebel tour organizers			1
" we wanted to show them off to the world so they would see it the same as we saw it			0
" later that year , a team from @entity123 followed			0
and it was n't long before many began suspecting @entity59 was also targeting a team from the @entity10 , the dominant force in world cricket			1
" you heard a lot of whispers around the place that perhaps these guys were going to @entity59 , " recalled broadcaster @entity129			1
" but at that time , we could n't believe that they could assemble a team of @entity10 players given the whole background to the anti-apartheid movement			1
" many big - name @entity10 stars were outspoken in their refusal to play in apartheid @entity59			1
captain @entity41 said no amount of money could get him there			1
future captain @entity147 called it " blood money			1
" but other players were tempted			1
the offers from @entity59 were more than they would likely see in their lifetimes -- estimated to be between $ 100,000 and $ 150,000 per player			1
it was enough to draw in names like batsmen @entity156 and @entity158 , fast bowler @entity159 and wicketkeeper @entity160 -- one of the best in the game			0
also agreeing to take part was @entity165 , hero of the 1979 @entity16			0
" i made the decision because i was n't getting treated right as far as the @entity10 ( team ) was concerned , " said @entity165			1
" and i said to myself , ' well , cricket is my job			0
you 're not picking me , i 'll go play cricket someplace where people will see proper cricket			1
' and that 's why i went			1
" more than just cricket rising star @entity31 was only 23 in 1983 , with a promising career in front of him			0
he had repeatedly turned down offers to play in @entity59			1
but the day the team left , @entity31 had a change of heart			0
" i knew the tour was more important than being just cricket , " @entity31 said			0
" i believe that cricket can make a difference , and i 'm going to be a part of that team			1
" on the plane , @entity31 recalled , some of the players began having second thoughts			1
but it was too late -- they were on their way to @entity59 , to face apartheid head on			1
" when we got to @entity59 , i realized that separation , and it was n't only black and white , " he said			1
" it 's the language that you speak , the area that you live in , and it 's what you 're allowed to do , and where you can go			1
so the divisions were very real when we got there			0
" unsure of how they 'd be received by the country 's mainly white fanbase , the @entity10 rebels prepared for their first test match			2
but their worries soon proved unfounded -- in droves , crowds came out to see the famous cricketers			2
" we packed them in , " said @entity160			0
" we turned out 20,000 in @entity211 , the heart of apartheid			2
" as the tour went on , the players began to believe something more important than just cricket was taking place			2
young kids -- white kids -- were begging them for autographs			0
it seemed @entity90 fans could n't get enough of the black cricketers from the @entity10			1
" for the first time , they were seeing blacks beating whites , " said newspaper writer @entity224 , the only journalist from the @entity6 to go to @entity59			1
" here was a country in which no black man had ever seen a black person in competition with a white person , and beating them			2
to me , that was where the real victory was			0
" ' destroyed as cricketers ' but critics of the tour disagree			2
they say the presence of a team of black men in @entity59 did not help end apartheid , but instead strengthened and supported it			1
even within the country itself , non-whites protested the @entity10 rebels			0
back home in the @entity6 , the reaction was worse			0
a deep sense of betrayal cut through the @entity6			0
cricketers who were once viewed as heroes were now seen as sellouts			2
when the month - long tour was over , the rebel players knew they would have to face the repercussions of their decision back home			1
" i felt sorry for them , " said @entity224 , " because i knew that they would never outlive what they were returning to			0
" the fate of their cricketing careers rested with the @entity270			0
the players were aware they might face a ban -- after all , @entity109 's rebel team had been banned for three years ; @entity123 's was banned for 25 years			1
but they did not expect to be banned for life			0
" many of them were destroyed as cricketers , " said @entity277 professor @entity276			2
" their cricket careers came to an end			0
" @entity160 , once a star , is now drifting , unable to hold a job in @entity3			0
in the years after the tour , he eventually lost more than just his career			0
his wife gave birth to their baby daughter in @entity291 , while @entity160 was playing in @entity59			1
they faced being deported from @entity291 for his role in the rebel tours , and were unwelcome back in the @entity6 , too			0
they had a newborn , and nowhere to go			0
" they did n't want me to return , " @entity160 said			0
" politics got into it			0
" when asked if his current situation resulted from his decision to go , @entity160 answered : " most likely			0
" mercenaries ? for @entity31 , the once - rising star , his cricketing past is behind him			2
he is now a golf instructor at a country club in @entity3			0
but he still finds a way to connect to the sport he loved at the cricket and golf academy he started near his home			0
there , a photo of his rebel team sits proudly on the shelf			0
it is not the memories of the tour he wants to forget , but what came after			0
" nobody looked out for us , " @entity31 said			0
for the players , their lives defined by this single moment in sport history , each day is a reminder of what they lost by going to @entity59			1
but they gained something , too -- strong bonds forged on a tour condemned by the rest of their world , cherished by the participants			0
and to this day , they hold strongly to the belief that being in @entity59 in 1983 made a difference in disbanding apartheid , less than a decade after the @entity10 players were there			1
@entity224 wrote a seven - part series about the tour			2
in the last article , he stated the trip might have started with the players being viewed as mercenaries , but he saw them as missionaries " who converted white @entity90 to accepting that blacks were their equals			2
" " i know i went there as a missionary , " @entity165 said			0
" i do n't see the mercenary part of it or whatever			0
we were just professional cricketers			2
you 've got work to do			0
" " what do mercenaries do ? " @entity31 asked			0
" they go and fight somebody else 's cause			2
" well , yes i was a mercenary for black people 's cause , because wherever i 've been , i 've been an ambassador for my country , my race and the game of cricket			1
so if that 's being a mercenary , then yes i was			2
