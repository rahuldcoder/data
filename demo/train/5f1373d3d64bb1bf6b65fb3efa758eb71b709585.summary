-- the @entity4 graduate student infected two weeks ago with a rare " flesh - eating " bacteria was making progress , albeit slowly , her father said tuesday			1
" she was in high spirits , " @entity7 told @entity0 about his daughter , @entity8 , 24 , who was on a ventilator in intensive care at @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13			1
" she appears to be remembering day - to - day different conversations we 've had			1
we actually referred to some conversations she had yesterday , so her memory is -- short - term memory -- appears to be coming back , which is a very encouraging sign			1
" as a result of the damage done by the bacterial infection called necrotizing fasciitis , doctors have removed part of @entity7 's abdomen , amputated a leg and expect to remove her fingers , her father said on a website run by the @entity31			1
" however , physicians have hope of bringing life back to the palms of her hands , which could allow her the muscle control to use helpful prosthetics , " he said			1
" they are awaiting a safe time before embarking on surgery for this			2
" @entity7 , who has been on life support since may 4 , regained consciousness a week later , according to the school 's website			1
the master 's student in psychology at the school was with friends on may 1 near the @entity53 , about 50 miles west of @entity54 , when she grabbed onto a zip line			2
it snapped and she fell			2
the accident left a gash in her left calf that took 22 staples to close			2
three days later , still in pain , she went to an emergency room , where doctors determined she had contracted the flesh - devouring bacteria @entity66			0
she was taken to @entity12 for surgery			0
but , as of tuesday night , she had not yet fully grasped the extent of her illness , her father said			1
" as far as all the specifics , we steered her away from the experience itself			0
to me , it probably does not good in her healing process to bring up any bad memories , at this point			0
" bored with television , his daughter was reading and trying to communicate with her family , the father said on the website			1
but the ventilator made talking difficult , he said			0
" some of the simplest words can take minutes to decipher when you have a tube interfering with your lips and movement of your jaw			0
" for example , he added , " lamb chop " turned out to be " laptop			0
" @entity7 has been infused with 177 units of blood since she contracted the infection			1
that 's more than 168 pints ; the average human body contains about 10 pints of blood , according to @entity101			1
" you 've got a lot of need , " the father said			2
" we 've got blood drives in @entity12 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , " he added , referring to communities in @entity13			1
the bacteria are " remarkably common in the water and in the environment , " according to dr. @entity114 , an assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases at @entity116			0
" when it gets into those deeper tissues , it has a remarkable ability to destroy the tissues that surround it in sort of this hunt for nutrition , " he said			0
" when it does that , those tissues die , and you see the inflammation and the swelling and the destruction that can be very difficult to control			0
" her wound became infected , " and the infection ( ran ) wild , " @entity114 said			0
the infection is fatal in about one in four cases , the @entity136 says on its website			0
students at the school have rallied to @entity7 's aid			0
a blood drive was to be held tuesday at the student center			2
a second blood drive is planned next week in @entity145 , where the family lives .			2

" she appears to be remembering *...* different conversations , " father says
blood drives are *launched* in several communities for @entity8
she has been on life support since may 4
