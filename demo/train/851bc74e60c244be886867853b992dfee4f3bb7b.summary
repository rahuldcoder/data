-- the only thing that dawned when the official " @entity3 " title was announced on wednesday was how much the @entity4 hated it			1
for months , fans have referred to the upcoming " @entity7 " sequel as just " @entity3 vs. @entity8 , " a placeholder that also recognizes the fact that both superheroes are appearing on the big screen together for the first time			1
but on wednesday , the actual title was unveiled to be " @entity3 v @entity8 : @entity3 , " along with the announcement that production on the project is now underway in metro @entity18			1
immediately , the @entity19 fired back			0
" @entity21 v @entity20 : @entity3			2

" ok , i just clicked on ' @entity3 ' in a panic , thinking it was yet another @entity27 , " said @ @entity24			2
" @entity3 sounds like @entity30 's comeback movie , " quipped @ @entity28			1
" @entity3 ? so that 's why @entity3 looks so sad , " said @ @entity31 , referencing the recently released first look at @entity33 's @entity3			1
( who , yes , does look pretty down			0
) another user thought " it makes it sound like a direct - to - dvd movie you 'd find in a bargain bin , " as @entity37 's @entity36 tried to remind the displeased masses , " it 's always darkest before dawn ( of justice )			0
" " does anyone out there like the title ? " kit asked			0
" anyone ? " well at least one person does -- if he could only figure out why the studio insisted on taking the " s " out of " vs. " " the ' @entity3 ' thing is cool but having it be @entity8 is annoying my @entity57 , " tweeted @entity54			1
" when i see the new title , i read it as ' @entity59 '			0
help me ! " others are more concerned that the movie 's going to have some sort of secret , litigious spin			0
what if ' @entity3 v. @entity8 : @entity3 ' is a law movie ? and ' @entity3 v. @entity8 ' is the lawsuit ? " asked @ @entity67			1
if it is , the @entity71 press release wednesday did n't give any indication of that			0
along with the new title and new logo , the statement confirmed that @entity77 ( " @entity78 " ) is writing the script , which we already knew would be directed by " @entity7 " helmer @entity81			2
in addition to @entity33 , @entity82 returns as @entity8 , and @entity84 is going to play @entity85			2
@entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 are all reprising their " @entity7 " roles , and they 'll be joined by @entity91 as @entity92 , @entity93 as @entity94 and @entity95 in an unspecified , newly created role			0
