@entity0 -- food - safety advocates and survivors of food - borne illness called wednesday for the @entity5 to pass a bill that has been in limbo since last year			1
" when things go wrong with the food supply , consumers sometimes are the last to know but the first to pay , " said @entity8 of the @entity0 - based , non-profit advocacy group @entity9			2
the group released a report wednesday detailing the food recalls that have occurred since july 2009 , when the @entity17 @entity16 passed legislation that would give more power and responsibility to the @entity21 to make the food supply safer			1
in the 13 intervening months , the @entity5 has failed to pass companion legislation , she said			1
during that time , 85 recalls of @entity21 - regulated foods have been announced , she said			1
@entity27 , director of the @entity28 at the @entity29 , which helped prepare the eight - page report , said 14 of the recalls covered all 50 states and the @entity0			2
eighty percent were the result of microbial contamination -- salmonella ( 42 percent ) or listeria ( 38 percent ) -- both of which can prove fatal , he said			0
the recalls were associated with 1,850 reported illnesses -- most from the recent egg recall -- though that likely underestimates the true number since " reported illnesses account for only a fraction of the true number of food - related illness in the country , " he said			2
one of those reportedly sickened by recalled food was @entity50 , 13 , of @entity51 , @entity52			2
four years ago , after eating spinach contaminated with @entity54 , she got pain in her stomach , she said			0
that was followed by bloody diarrhea , swelling around her brain , kidney failure , diabetes and loss of vision and hearing , she said			0
" i am ok now , " she said , looking healthy			0
after recovering from her illness , she started advocating for food safety , she said			1
" my experience has shown me you ca n't assume we are protected , so we have to demand the government does its job well			0
" the proposed @entity72 ( @entity73 510 ) covers many aspects of food safety , including better preventive control measures by manufacturers , more frequent inspections of facilities , and greater @entity21 authority over recalls			1
" we believe it would significantly cut down on the number of recalls and , when they do occur , it would allow the @entity21 to identify the food more quickly , " @entity9 's @entity8 said			1
she said that , despite bipartisan support for the bill , it has not been brought to the floor			0
" we 've been told that the legislation was on the calendar for at least the last six months , " she said			0
" this is an urgent priority for the @entity17 consumer and we need to make it an urgent priority for @entity17 senators as well			0

advocates want the @entity5 to pass a food safety bill when it *reconvenes*
the @entity16 passed the *change* in july 2009
groups detailed recalls that have taken place since then
the proposed act would give the @entity21 more power over food recalls
