-- our @entity2 weekend trip around the " @entity5 " table included @entity7 jitters over @entity8 , the 2016 impact of president @entity11 's immigration deliberations , progressive worries about @entity14 's hawkish foreign policy views , and @entity7 angst about a research project that was designed to help but may have done more harm then good			1
as @entity19 look for 2014 " steals , " there 's no place like @entity8 ? we talked for months about how @entity7 sen. @entity22 of @entity8 was hardly a top performer in his primary race against a tea party challenger			1
but @entity22 survived , and so the first reflex was to say , ok -- it 's @entity8			1
lock that @entity27 seat in for the @entity7			1
a number of top @entity7 strategists who have seen the latest research say it is now hardly a sure thing			1
these strategists are furious with @entity22 personally , and even more so with a campaign team they say has not risen to the challenge			0
so there is mounting pressure on the other @entity8 senator , @entity38 , who just happens to lead the @entity39			1
i 'm told leading @entity7 voices are pushing the @entity39 to get more aggressive , including pushing for a shakeup in the @entity22 campaign team			2
and in the @entity7 super pac community , there are conversations that it might become necessary to spend money in a state that no one thought would be -- or should be -- on a 2014 list of potential @entity19 pickups			2
it 's important because the @entity7 needs a gain of six seats to win the @entity27 majority ; if it lost a @entity7 - held seat , it would have to win another @entity19 seat to net six			1
and while the @entity7 super pacs are seemingly flush with money , the 65 - day clock to @entity60 will force choices -- and if there need to be sudden investments in @entity8 , a few @entity7 challengers in other states could see their outside help shrink			1
maybe not all knowledge is good the @entity7 has a gender problem			2
so the @entity7 did some research on its gender problem			2
makes perfect sense , right ? well , @entity75 's @entity74 took us inside a @entity7 debate on that very question			2
maybe if this private research by @entity81 and the @entity82 had stayed private , it would be viewed as helpful			0
but @entity74 's @entity75 colleagues got hold of it and outlined how some women view the @entity7 as intolerant or stuck in the past			2
" this infuriated a number of @entity7 , who privately said -- and some of them less privately -- they thought this was completely undermining , they could n't understand the purpose of this , that this is at cross ends to what the @entity7 is trying to do in the final couple of months of a very difficult midterm , " said @entity74			1
a " waveless " @entity7 win ? @entity100 of the @entity101 says her analysis suggests @entity7 can not count on a big midterm wave this year -- like the one they enjoyed in 2010 or the one @entity19 rode to midterm gains in 2006			1
but no wave does n't necessarily mean no wins ; @entity107 says it is still more than within reason -- and reach -- that we 'll see the @entity7 get the net gain of six @entity27 seats they need to capture the @entity27 majority			1
" what we have come to find , every election , is that you do n't see it coming until @entity60 , but one side or the other , almost always , the races break disproportionately their way -- 55 , 60 , 65 % , " said @entity107			0
" so that 's more of the question than waiting for a big fat wave to hit us the day after @entity2			0
immigration pressures on @entity19 and 2016 field the @entity126 promises some executive actions on immigration , though there are now indications more controversial decisions might be pushed back until after the november election			0
as we await final word , @entity134 's @entity133 highlighted jitters among some democrats in tight races this year but also said any @entity11 action this year would put pressure on the 2016 class of @entity7 presidential contenders			1
" last week , @entity144 was in @entity145 , " said @entity133			0
" he said it was part of his annual medical mission trip , but he brought his political staff , reporters and a film crew with an aerial drone			0
" @entity133 also pointed out that @entity154 gov. @entity153 is taking his second trip out of the country as governor next week and the destination is -- @entity159			0
@entity161 worries about @entity162 liberals love when @entity14 goes after big banks and pushes her populist economic views			0
but @entity166 of the @entity167 reports that some progressives are now getting a bit wary -- coming to the conclusion that on some big foreign policy questions , the @entity172 senator sounds , disturbingly to them , a lot like @entity176			0
" she essentially said that @entity178 have the right to defend themselves and in the question of sort of civilian casualties , she essentially says that , well , it 's @entity184 ' fault because they have put rocket launchers next to schools and in hospitals , " said @entity177			0
so over these next weeks , @entity19 will watch to see what @entity162 says about @entity189 and @entity190 and what she does on her trip to @entity178 in november .			0

a number of top @entity7 strategists say a @entity7 win in @entity8 is now hardly a sure thing
*republicans* can not count on a big midterm wave this year
any action this year on immigration would put pressure on the 2016 class of @entity7 presidential contenders
