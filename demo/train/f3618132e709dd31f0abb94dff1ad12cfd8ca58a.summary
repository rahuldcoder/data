@entity0 , @entity1 -- driving in @entity1 's @entity0 valley , a region located close to the border with @entity6 , i can sense the difference immediately			1
the faces of young children , women and families who walk around seem relaxed			2
the streets buzz with an air of calm			2
@entity0 is full of life once again			1
it 's a marked difference from the previous times i 've been here			1
the last time was shortly after @entity19 was shot			1
back then , a sense of sorrow and shock hung in the air			0
everything felt still and drained			0
the town was in mourning			1
in these past nine months , we have written and read so much about @entity19			1
it boils down to this -- a 15 - year - old schoolgirl was shot at point blank range for encouraging girls to go to school			1
in pictures : @entity19 's road to recovery the residents have not forgotten the horrific events of october 2012 -- especially the young people who had to return to school			1
in most places going to school does not mean risking your life , but in @entity0 -- that 's exactly what young girls and boys have been doing			1
they defy threats from the @entity52			1
global view the @entity1 @entity52 ran a ruthless campaign of bombing girls ' schools and carrying out public executions in 2007 - 2008			0
then , the shooting of @entity19 last year brought the world 's attention to the issue			1
but how are other young women and @entity0 dealing with the impact of events ? i traveled to the @entity0 to find out			1
in pictures : the world 's other @entity67 it was n't easy finding somewhere to film			1
i contacted several schools and colleges			0
@entity2 asked to film at @entity19 's school but the principal declined			1
she wants to encourage young girls to continue going to school , she does not want them to become a target			1
@entity19 's shooting put the spotlight on @entity0 and the young women there			1
not everyone enjoys that focus			0
they fear the @entity52 will attack them simply for picking up a school book			1
i visited a girls ' college in @entity0 soon after @entity19 's shooting last october			1
the young women i spoke to were adamant they would continue with their education			1
their college was due to be renamed the @entity94 in her honor			0
but days later authorities changed their minds -- the girls and their parents said they would be too scared to attend if it was associated with @entity19			1
girls defiant we were given permission to film at a women 's college for science and technology			1
most of the girls were local , but some had come all the way from @entity112 to study in @entity0			1
it 's a sign of how things are changing here			1
years of @entity52 brutality both in @entity0 and the surrounding areas have clearly left a lasting impact on the people there			1
the young girls i spoke to have not forgotten the images of death and destruction			0
they tell me about what they saw , how it filled them with fear and dread			0
they hug me and thank me for coming to see them			0
@entity132 , 17 , speaks confidently at first , but when asked about the @entity52 , the psychological impact is visible			0
she is breathless and nervous , but determined to speak out			0
" it was a real crisis all over -- especially girls were not allowed to get educated , now it 's completely freedom , " she says			1
we are free to go to our schools or colleges , wherever we want , it 's freedom all over			2
" it makes me really proud and really happy			0
" dreams of educated future i ask another girl , named @entity147 , if her fear of the @entity52 ever made her think twice about coming to school or college			2
she looks me in the eye and says with conviction , " we should not stop education because of someone else			2
or because of the scare [ fear ] of something			0
" she has dreams that extend beyond her education			2
" i want to be an engineer in future , " she says			0
i do n't know why , but i hope to be an engineer			0
" people around the world have heard of @entity19 , but she is not alone			1
she is not the only one fighting for female education			1
every girl i met in those classrooms , every single one is defying the @entity52 simply by going to school			2
some are breaking new ground for their families as the first women to make it to college or plan careers			0
others are breaking cultural taboos			0
all of them are standing up for their rights			0
" yes , there was a time when young girls could n't get an education , but women did n't give up hope or strength , " says @entity184			2
she is just 17 , but her confidence and wisdom belies her young age			0
" we studied in our homes , we hid and came to school in secret			2
@entity1 's females are very strong , and brave , " she says			2
family support of course this would not be possible if their parents did not make the bold and brave decision to send their daughters to school			2
with a smile on her face , she says that they " supported me in every field of my life			0
they told me that whatever job you like you can do it			0
" i asked @entity132 why an education was so important to her			2
she told me confidently , " i want to be independent			0
i want to be myself , i do n't want to be dependent on somebody else -- my parents or anybody			0
that 's why i want to be educated			2
" the experiences of these young girls have clearly molded them to be mature beyond their years			0
" we are not scared now , " @entity132 adds			0
" we want to seek knowledge and learn more and more , and @entity226 if @entity227 is with us , we will do it			0
" " i 'll realize my dreams , as well as my parents ' dreams			0
i 'm strong , my friends are strong and i think all girls of @entity1 are strong and we 'll prove it			0
