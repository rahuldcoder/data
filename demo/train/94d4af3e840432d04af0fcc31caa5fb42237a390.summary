" as painful as this day is and always will be , it leaves us with a lesson that no single event can ever destroy who we are , no act of terrorism can ever change what we stand for , " @entity1 said , adding : " when the history books are written , the true legacy of 9/11 will not be one of fear or hate or division			1
it will be a safer world , a stronger nation , and a people more united than ever before			0

in deeply personal remarks that reflected his own experience of losing his wife and daughter in a 1972 car crash , @entity72 told family and loved ones of the victims that " no matter how many anniversaries you experience , for at least an instant , the terror of that moment returns -- the lingering echo of that phone call ; that sense of total disbelief that envelops you , where you feel like you 're being sucked into a black hole in the middle of your chest			0
" neither @entity1 nor @entity72 planned any campaign events for the day , even though the november election against @entity113 challenger @entity112 is less than two months away			1
in a speech tuesday afternoon to a @entity116 meeting in @entity117 , @entity112 refrained from his usual political attacks			1
" i would normally speak to a gathering like this about the differences between my and my opponent 's plans for our military and for our national security , " the former @entity120 governor said			2

" @entity6 showed the world how a unified nation can fight back against darkness and fear , " said senate majority leader @entity163 , @entity164 , while his @entity113 counterpart , minority leader @entity165 of @entity166 , remembered how legislators gathered on the steps of the @entity89 on that day to sing " @entity169			1
" " it was one of the most uplifting and unifying moments in the history of our country , " @entity174 said of the shared display of patriotism 11 years earlier			0

in a post on @entity225 , @entity112 got in an apparent political jab by making sure the words " under @entity228 " were included			2
at its national convention last week , the @entity229 initially omitted the word " @entity228 " from its platform			0
" on this most somber day , @entity6 is united under @entity228 in its quest for peace and freedom at home and across the world , " the @entity112 tweet said			1
it followed a statement by @entity112 that his campaign released overnight that initially made no mention of @entity228 , then later added a similar " under @entity228 " reference			2
" on this most somber day , those who would attack us should know that we are united , one nation under @entity228 , in our determination to stop them and to stand tall for peace and freedom at home and across the world , " the amended statement said			2
