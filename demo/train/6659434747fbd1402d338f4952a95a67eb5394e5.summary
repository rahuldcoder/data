the fact that the @entity12 , @entity13 , police sought charges against @entity4 is not entirely unexpected , as he and a third person had been cited for misdemeanor assault in the incident in question , according to a statement from that town 's police released april 25			1
but the " @entity25 @entity24 " charge that police are now recommending is more serious than the " @entity27 " charge that @entity4 was cited for shortly after the incident			1

authorities responded to a domestic disturbance call the afternoon of monday , april 23 , at a @entity12 residence where @entity4 , 44 , complained he was assaulted by @entity53 , 38 , and another woman identified as @entity55 , also 38 , according to an earlier police statement			1
@entity53 was detained on a charge of simple assault , a misdemeanor , that statement said			1
after further investigation , police cited @entity64 and @entity4 for " @entity27 simple assault , " but neither was taken into custody			1
@entity53 was released a day later and said she had n't been given a " fair shake " over allegations that she attacked @entity4 in an incident he made public in a series of bizarre @entity73 postings			1
" i understand that i have very little chance at beating a @entity42 , two - sport man that everyone seems to love and adore , " @entity53 said , proclaiming her innocence			2
the @entity78 said @entity53 , under an emergency protective order , is forbidden from returning to the couple 's home for 61 days and can not threaten or harass any member of the family			2
in one of the messages posted last week on his verified @entity73 account , @entity4 included a photo of what he said were his children filling out complaints to give to police in @entity13			1
" pray for me and my kids now ! they just witnessed their mother and a friend jump me in my room , " said the first tweet , posted at 6:15 p.m. " she 's going to jail n i 'm pressing charges ! " two minutes later , @entity4 tweeted again			2
" i 'm sad my boys witnessed this mess but i warned the police department here that she was gone try n harm me and my boys			0
this is on my mama ! " it said			0

@entity4 has two other children from an earlier relationship			2
the couple married in 1999 and starred in a reality show , " @entity129 : @entity130 , " that aired on the @entity132			0
the marriage soured , however , and the two are engaged in bitter divorce proceedings			0
in february , @entity53 filed a suit against her husband and his aunt , @entity139			2
she said the aunt attacked her in their 10 - bedroom , 29,000 - square - foot home in @entity12 while @entity4 watched			1
at the time , the athlete tweeted that his wife was the aggressor and the aunt was in the home merely to fix his phone			0
@entity53 also filed a separate suit against her husband and his daughter , @entity151 , after she called her stepmother a " gold - digging ( expletive ) " and " the number one gold digger of the year " in @entity73 posts			1
@entity4 played for several @entity45 teams , including the @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159			0
