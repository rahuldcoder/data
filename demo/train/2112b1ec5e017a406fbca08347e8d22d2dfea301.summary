-- @entity1 is a grown man who made a grownup decision to take his massive basketball - playing ability from @entity5 to @entity6 in a desire to get the one thing every true baller desires : the opportunity to call yourself a champion			1
forget all the nonsense about him " owing " his hometown and how his legacy could have been cemented had he stayed in the @entity16 and continued to try to win a title in @entity5			1
@entity1 had the absolute right to pick up his things and go where he thought it was best to win , and he did it			1
enough with all of this ridiculous chatter that he 's a selfish , spoiled basketball prodigy			2
@entity1 was an employee of the @entity5			1
he had no ownership stake and no control			2
everyone talks about what his presence meant to the @entity5 economy			1
did he own any of those businesses ? no. but he made them , and the @entity5 , richer by his play			1
there is undoubtedly a tradeoff , because being a star athlete is a two - way street			0
you become richer by virtue of folks coming to see you play , and the league , team , marketers and surrounding businesses get to piggyback off of your success			0
@entity1 gave them a solid seven seasons , and everyone enjoyed the ride			1
say thank you for the @entity1 gravy train , and now , like any smart business owner , you need to figure out your next revenue stream			1
now , let 's deal with the fans			0
i read with fascination about how @entity1 " owed " the fans			1
really ? what exactly did he owe them ? we need to stop with this belief that fans in a city " own " a particular player			1
we get to sit back and enjoy the skills of these modern - day gladiators in our gleaming new @entity64 , while they bust their butts , play injured and have to take all of the criticism when things go bad			0
as fans , we justify it all by saying , " well , he 's getting millions to play , so he should shut up			0
" we need to grow up and realize that once his playing days are over , we will say , " thanks , @entity1 , now move over so we can worship the next stud			1
" in fact , when a particular athlete has overstayed their welcome , the fans are the loudest in telling him to leave the court			0
to me , there is a huge difference between a player like @entity1 and @entity83 of the @entity84			1
@entity83 has pocketed nearly $ 40 million and has refused to show up at training sessions with @entity86 because he does n't like the defensive scheme			2
@entity1 showed up and did his part , and when his contract was up , he exercised his free will to do as he pleased and shop his talents			1
he did what every single @entity93 wants : to go to a new job where the desires you always wanted can be fulfilled			0
so how is that wrong ? no one -- athlete , stockbroker , @entity101 greeter , grocery store clerk , secretary , journalist -- wants to be treated like they are a piece of property			2
we all desire the freedom that comes with making our own choice as to where we want to work and achieve the goals in life that we all set			0
i can identify with that			0
in 1993 , i decided to leave the @entity117 , where i was the county government reporter			0
the then - city editor sat across from me and said , " i felt like it was a punch in the gut when told you were leaving			2
" he had an indignant , paternalistic tone that i found offensive			0
see , i was making $ 24,000			0
when the @entity123 pursued me for a job a few months earlier that would be around $ 27,000 , i was told i was talking myself out of a job in @entity126			0
so when the @entity127 offered me a gig at $ 32,000 , i did n't even bother seeing whether @entity126 wanted to counter			2
the new job allowed me to go to a bigger market and have the upward mobility i desired , so i took the job			0
so i told the city editor , " look , you did n't take some kid off the street , teach him how to talk , write and dress			1
you paid me for a service , and i delivered			0
now i 'm choosing to take my skills elsewhere			0
" i then got up and left the meeting			0
it was offensive to me that my bosses at the paper felt like i was being an ungrateful employee			0
i wanted to do more with my talents , and i refused to allow someone to make me feel bad about my decision			2
it 's my life , my career , my choice			0
so how is that bad ? now i get folks who did n't like @entity1 having a one - hour special to announce his decision			1
but we are all used to the hype in sports			0
do we really need a six - hour pregame show for the @entity157 ? ca n't we play the @entity159 all - star game without all of the side attractions ? would boxing be boxing without the wild and crazy news conferences ? hype and sports go hand - in - hand			2
that 's why i found the letter written by @entity5 owner @entity167 so pathetic			1
here is a man who was enriched by the play of @entity1 ; according to @entity171 , the value of the franchise increased by $ 100 million with his on - court performance			1
yet instead of being a gracious owner and simply reaffirming his commitment to the fans to put a winning team on the court , @entity167 ripped @entity1 to shreds , calling him " narcissistic " and his decision to leave a " cowardly betrayal " and " a shameful display of selfishness			1
" @entity167 even went on to trash all athletes by saying , " it 's time for people to hold these athletes accountable for their actions			0
is this the way you raise your children ? " in an interview , @entity167 later said @entity1 quit on the team in the playoffs the past two years			1
really ? so if he was all of that , @entity167 , why did you want to re-sign him ? who wants a quitter on his team ? if @entity1 had chosen to stay in @entity5 , rich boy @entity167 would have been all smiles , slapping his back , getting ready to count the money he could make off of the back of @entity1			1
so who would have been the real selfish , narcissistic individual , @entity167 ? @entity167 now says it 's time to speak out against @entity1 , yet as long as @entity1 made him richer , he would have kept quiet			1
sorry , @entity167 , you 've pimped @entity1 long enough			1
@entity1 showed @entity167 that only @entity1 owes @entity1 an explanation			2
no owner , ceo or boss has the right to demand that someone stay as an employee			2
the employee has a right to live their life as they see fit			0
as the ceo of @entity1 , he did what 's in the best of interest of him			1
and as the most important shareholder , is n't that what he 's supposed to do ? i 'm sorry , folks , but the loyalty that used to exist from teams and companies is gone			2
some still believe in it , but for many of us , we 're simply a dot on the spreadsheet			0
business is cutthroat , and we have to accept that reality			0
so , @entity1 , go to @entity6 and do your thing			2
grow your corporation to be as big as you want it to be			0
and never look back at the haters who are mad you chose not to act like a highly paid indentured servant or 21st - century slave , held in place by the invisible shackles dressed up as loyalty to a city , owing the fans and satisfying someone who is clearly an ungrateful owner			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity255 .			2

@entity255 says @entity1 is a grown man who made a grownup decision
he says @entity1 does n't owe his former employer or city loyalty
@entity255 : @entity1 acted in his own interest , as he should
@entity5 owner was wrong to rip @entity1 as " narcissistic , " @entity255 says
