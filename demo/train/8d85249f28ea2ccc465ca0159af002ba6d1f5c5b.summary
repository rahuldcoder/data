-- burning the @entity2 would be an " outrageous and grave gesture , " the @entity1 said wednesday , joining a chorus of voices pleading with a small @entity7 church not to burn @entity9 's holy book on the anniversary of the september 11 , 2001 , attacks			1
the @entity1 body responsible for dialogue with other religions expressed " great concern " about the plan by @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity7			1
@entity20 secretary of state @entity19 said it would be a " disrespectful , disgraceful act			1
" she was speaking tuesday night at a @entity23 dinner in honor of the @entity26 holy month of @entity27			2
her statement came a day after the top @entity20 military commander in @entity30 , gen. @entity31 , warned that the plan " could cause significant problems " for @entity20 troops overseas			2
but despite the growing pressure , the pastor of the @entity7 church , @entity37 , said wednesday that " as of this time we have no intention of canceling			1
" @entity37 all week has rebuffed pleas to call off the event , saying radical islamists are the target of his message			1
" the general needs to point his finger to radical @entity9 and tell them to shut up , tell them to stop , tell them that we will not bow our knees to them , " @entity37 said on @entity0 's " @entity47			1
" " we are burning the book , " @entity37 said			1
" we are not killing someone			2
we are not murdering people			2
" @entity37 announced wednesday that the church 's website provider has " canceled " @entity17 's accounts , though its website , and another url for a book written by @entity37 titled " @entity9 is of the @entity65 , " were still accessible wednesday evening			1
" we feel that it 's definitely an indirect attack on our freedom of speech , " @entity37 said , adding that the provider , @entity66 , is " trying to shut us down			1
" but he said , " this is not going to affect the event going forward			2
" a spokesman for the provider , @entity66 , said the company decided to cancel the center 's sites after investigating a complaint and reviewing both sites			2
the center " violated the hate - speech provision of our acceptable - use policy , " said @entity66 spokesman @entity77			2
" this is not a constitutional issue			2
this is a contract issue , " said @entity77 , adding that his company had given the center until midnight to find another host and move its content			2
@entity77 said @entity66 has about 100,000 customers and he did not know how long it had hosted those two specific sites			2
on tuesday , @entity37 said his flock was taking @entity31 ' warning seriously but had not decided to cancel the event			1
@entity37 told @entity0 that while his congregation still plans to burn @entity95 to protest the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , the church is " weighing " its intentions			1
" we have firmly made up our mind , but at the same time , we are definitely praying about it , " @entity37 said on @entity0 's " @entity98			1
" as reaction to the planned event grew wednesday , former @entity104 gov. @entity103 took to social media outlets , using @entity106 to call on @entity37 to " please stand down			1
" on @entity107 , @entity103 wrote that @entity37 ' planned @entity2 burning " will feed the fire of caustic rhetoric and appear as nothing more than mean - spirited religious intolerance			1
do n't feed that fire			2
" @entity114 mayor @entity113 is one of the few public officials who defended @entity37 ' right to go ahead , even as he condemned the idea as " distasteful			1
" i do n't think he would like if somebody burned a book that in his religion he thinks is holy			0
... but the @entity125 protects everybody , and you ca n't say that we are going to apply the @entity125 to only those cases where we are in agreement , " @entity113 said , citing the section of the @entity123 that promises freedom of speech			0
" if you want to be able to say what you want to say when the time comes that you want to say it , you have to defend others no matter how much you disagree with them , " @entity113 said			0
the planned action has drawn sharp criticism from @entity26 around the world and from @entity20 officials			0
the @entity20 @entity140 in @entity141 condemned it as " disrespectful , intolerant and divisive , " in a statement on wednesday			0

" it emphasized that it strongly condemned " the offensive messages , which are contrary to @entity20 government policy and deeply offensive to @entity26 especially during the month of @entity27			0
" " americans from all religious and ethnic backgrounds reject the offensive initiative by this small group in @entity7			0
a great number of @entity20 voices are protesting the hurtful statements made by this organization , " the @entity30 embassy said			0
the @entity20 ambassador to @entity173 , @entity172 , issued a joint statement with @entity175 , the commanding general of @entity20 forces in @entity173 , to condemn the act			0
" as this holy month of @entity27 comes to a close and @entity173 prepare to celebrate @entity179 , we join with the citizens of @entity173 and of every nation to repudiate religious intolerance and to respect and defend the diversity of faiths of our fellow man , " they wrote			0
with about 120,000 @entity20 and @entity187 - led troops still battling @entity188 and its allies in the @entity9 fundamentalist @entity191 movement , @entity31 warned that burning @entity95 " is precisely the kind of action the @entity191 uses and could cause significant problems -- not just here , but everywhere in the world we are engaged with the @entity9 community			0
" @entity201 president @entity200 denounced the @entity2 burning as " contrary to the teachings of tolerant divine religions and totally incompatible with the logic of dialogue among civilizations , religions and cultures			0

@entity224 has the world 's largest @entity26 population			0
@entity37 said his congregation is aware that the action is offensive			1
" we realize that this action would indeed offend people , offend the @entity26			0
i am offended when they burn the flag			0
i am offended when they burn the @entity243			0
but we feel that the message that we are trying to send is much more important than people being offended			1
" @entity37 said @entity26 are welcomed in the @entity20 , if they observe the @entity123 and do n't try to impose @entity246 , or @entity26 law			1
the message , he said , is directed toward the " radical element of @entity9			1
" " our message is very clear , " he said			1
" it is not to the moderate @entity26			0
our message is not a message of hate			1
our message is a message of warning to the radical element of @entity9 , and i think what we see right now around the globe provides exactly what we 're talking about , " he said			1
the center says it was founded in 1986 as a " total concept church for the rich , the poor , the young and the old			0
" its purpose is to " stand up for righteousness and for the truth of the @entity243			1
