@entity0 -- @entity3 prime minister @entity2 promised wednesday that a vote will be held on @entity3 's membership in the @entity6 if his party wins the next election , in 2015			1
should @entity3 stay in the @entity6 ? what would the impact be if it left ? send us your thoughts			1
@entity2 said the @entity3 people should have a choice about whether to remain in the @entity6 on the basis of a renegotiated settlement -- or to leave			1
the referendum should not be held until it 's clear how changes made after the crisis in the eurozone work out , he said , while giving a landmark speech on @entity24			1
but , he said , it is important to ask " difficult questions " about the future now			0
otherwise , @entity3 people could " drift towards the exit " if @entity24 fails			0
the key problems @entity24 faces are instability in the eurozone , a " crisis of @entity24 competitiveness as other nations across the world soar ahead , " and a lack of democratic accountability , @entity2 said			0
" there is a gap between the @entity6 and its citizens which has grown dramatically in recent years , " he said			0
as a result , " democratic consent for the @entity6 in @entity3 is now wafer thin , " he said , and public disillusionment is at an all - time high			2
" it is time to settle this @entity24 question in @entity3 politics , " he said			0
" i say to the @entity3 people : this will be your decision			0
" @entity3 warned against ' cherry - picking ' @entity6 policy the @entity3 prime minister insisted that he is not an isolationist , saying he would like @entity3 to remain part of @entity24 on the right terms , with the single market and competitiveness at the heart of the relationship			1
and he set out a vision for an " updated " @entity6 that is " more flexible , more adaptable , more open , fit for the challenges of the modern age " -- and said all options should be on the table to negotiate a new deal			2
he also warned that leaving the @entity6 would be a " one - way ticket " with no option of return			0
" over the coming weeks , months and years , i will not rest until this debate is won -- for the future of my country , for the success of the @entity6 and the prosperity of our peoples for generations to come , " he concluded			2
@entity2 promised a vote in the first half of the next parliament , if his party -- which is currently in a coalition government with the @entity82 -- wins the general election due in 2015			2
the prime minister has been under concerted pressure from some members of his party to hold a referendum on @entity24			2
the so - called eurosceptics want to see @entity3 get some powers back from the @entity6 , as well as a reduction in legislation they say holds back businesses			2
however , others both in and outside the party warn that creating uncertainty about @entity3 's membership in the @entity6 risks undermining the confidence of businesses and industry at a critical time			1
fellow @entity24 nations may also be unwilling to renegotiate the terms of @entity3 's membership			1
@entity105 and others have made it clear that @entity2 can not " cherry - pick " which elements of the @entity6 he signs up to , or risk unraveling the union to suit @entity3 interests			1
@entity105 foreign minister @entity113 told radio station @entity114 that the planned referendum " risks being dangerous for @entity3 itself because @entity3 outside of @entity24 , that will be difficult			0
" if @entity3 did decide to leave the @entity6 , @entity105 would roll out the red carpet for business leaders , @entity113 added			2
@entity124 prime minister @entity123 , speaking at the @entity120 in @entity121 , @entity122 , predicted @entity3 would remain in the @entity6			1
" i am confident that if there is to be a referendum one day , the @entity3 citizens will decide to stay in the @entity6 and contribute to shape its future , " he said			1
" i think the @entity6 does not need unwilling @entity24			0
" @entity3 is a net contributor to the @entity6 and an important player in the single market , which may give @entity2 some additional sway -- but critics warn he is taking a big gamble			1
former @entity136 prime minister @entity135 warned against trying " hold the @entity6 to ransom			1
" @entity135 , who leads the @entity138 in the @entity139 , said @entity2 's speech was " filled with inconsistencies " and showed " a degree of ignorance about how the @entity6 works			1
" new year , same old problems ? " by holding out the prospect of renegotiating the terms of @entity3 's membership of the @entity6 and subjecting it to a referendum , @entity2 is playing with fire , " he said			1
@entity151 president @entity150 last week told @entity2 that " the @entity151 values a strong @entity3 in a strong @entity6			1
" and @entity152 , the @entity151 assistant secretary for @entity24 affairs , also made it clear that there would be consequences for @entity3 if it either left the @entity6 or played a lesser role in @entity158			1
" we have a growing relationship with the @entity6 as an institution , which has an increasing voice in the world , and we want to see a strong @entity3 voice in that @entity6 , " he told reporters at the @entity160 in @entity0			1
" that is in @entity151 's interests			0
we welcome an outward - looking @entity6 with @entity3 in it			2
" markets across @entity24 were flat wednesday morning after @entity2 's speech , including in @entity0			2
labour leader @entity171 said ahead of @entity2 's address that it would " define him as a weak prime minister , being driven by his party , not by the national economic interest			1
" @entity171 said tuesday that @entity2 had rejected the idea of an " in / out " referendum on @entity24 in october 2011 because of the doubts it would foster			0
" the only thing that has changed since then is he has lost control of his party and is too weak to do what is right for the country , " @entity171 said			0
" everyone knows that the priority for @entity3 is the jobs and growth that we need			0
we have had warning after warning from @entity3 business about the dangers of creating years of uncertainty for @entity3			0
" @entity2 also lacks the support of his party 's coalition partner , the @entity82 , for the move			0
party leader and deputy prime minister @entity197 told @entity3 media that creating years of uncertainty over @entity3 's place in @entity24 was not in the national interest at this time			1
@entity2 's @entity203 faces a growing domestic political threat from the @entity3 @entity205 , or @entity206 , which wants @entity3 to withdraw fully from the @entity6			1
@entity206 leader @entity207 , who is also a member of the @entity139 , said @entity2 's speech wednesday had " defined the national debate about our place in the @entity6			1
no longer can the case for @entity3 withdrawal be confined to the margins			0
the genie is out of the bottle			0
" but @entity207 questioned whether @entity2 is truly committed to reclaiming powers from the @entity6 , or is just seeking to win votes			2
@entity219 , an expert in @entity6 law at @entity221 , said @entity2 will need to come up with " some convincing bargaining chips " if he wants to persuade other @entity6 members to negotiate a new deal			2
@entity2 's threat to wield @entity3 's veto over treaty changes to deepen ties within the eurozone will not be enough , @entity219 said			1
the @entity3 prime minister also focused on the importance of the single market , @entity219 said , but membership in this is tied to @entity6 rules regarding workers ' rights , consumer safety and environmental protection			1
to opt out of certain laws , such as the @entity6 directive on working hours , " is legally difficult and would disturb a premise of the single market , " he said			0
" overall , it would be very hard to change the fundamentals without allowing every country to pick on its own pet hates			0
" president of the @entity139 @entity249 had a similar view , tweeting : " # @entity252 not an option			0
we have to focus on jobs & growth rather than getting lost in treaties discussions			0
" @entity2 was due to give the speech on @entity24 last week but had to postpone its delivery because of the @entity261 hostage crisis			0
@entity262 : @entity263 is open for business should @entity3 stay in or leave the @entity6 ? what would be the impact on you or your country if it left ? add your thoughts in the comments section below			0
