-- i was in my office last week when a 14 - year - old soccer player came in with her parents			2
she told me a story that is , unfortunately , very common			2
she had been at practice when she planted her foot , twisted her knee and went down in a heap			2
" i felt a pop , " she said			2
even before examining her knee , i knew it was n't going to be good news			2
the knee was swollen , the first indication that bleeding inside the joint , called a hemarthrosis , had occurred			1
i pulled on her knee to test the ligaments and unfortunately , my suspicions were confirmed			2
she had torn her anterior cruciate ligament			1
because of its poor blood supply and location inside the knee , the @entity22 has the unfortunate distinction of being the ligament in the knee with the worst healing potential			1
this is important since the @entity22 has the most important job , keeping the femur ( thigh bone ) and the tibia ( leg bone ) moving in unison during twisting maneuvers			1
@entity22 injury is a buzz word among athletes			1
in young athletes , it 's an unfortunate reality , as they are occurring at increasing rates over the past two decades			1
in part it 's because more children are playing competitive sports and doing so at a younger ages			0
but they are also playing longer seasons and sometimes all year			0
now the @entity49 is advising doctors in a new clinical report on the best ways to approach and treat @entity22 injuries in children			1
teens who play sports have heard about the injury and know it is n't good			0
what they do n't quite realize , however , are the future implications			0
famous athletes such as quarterback @entity64 and alpine skier @entity65 have come back after acl surgery , so how bad can it be ? the truth is that surgery can restore knee function , but it does little to diminish the risk of arthritis 15 to 20 years down the line			1
regardless of whether an athlete has surgery , the risk of arthritis skyrockets later in life from an acl tear			0
kids who tear their acl today are often left with 60 - year - old knees when they 're 30			0
if parents and coaches realized the long - term implications of an acl injury , i think they 'd be more attuned to prevention			0
multiple studies have demonstrated that strong muscles , particularly the landing muscles in the hips , glutes and hamstrings , can prevent @entity22 injuries from happening			1
there are many resources to develop strength programs , including the @entity99 program and the acl solution			0
these and other programs are easy to implement at home or practice and twice per week is enough to make a difference			0
the new @entity49 report advocates this kind of training			1
demand that your youth sports programs have @entity22 prevention programs			1
if they do n't , set them up			0
although boys and girls are at risk for acl injury , post-pubertal girls are at least four times more likely to tear their acl than boys			0
parents can and should intervene to make sure their kids are safe			0
when i see young athletes who tear their @entity22 , one of the first questions their parents ask is : what could we have done to prevent this ? the answer : everything .			1

the anterior cruciate ligament , inside the knee , serves a crucial function
@entity22 injuries are increasing among young athletes
a new report recommends training to prevent @entity22 injuries
