editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8 is @entity5 's broadband television network			2
the reports , which are produced solely by @entity5 , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			2
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			2
@entity19 ( @entity20 ) -- on saturday , aug. 6 , people gathered in @entity22 to protest the police shooting of a 29 - year - old local man			1
it quickly escalated into riots , looting and arson			1
those @entity22 riots have now inspired copycats			0
early on monday evening the whole city rose up against law and order			0
shops were looted , huge buildings were burned , people were pulled from their cars and homes were invaded			0
all while our @entity39 , @entity19 's mayor and @entity43 's prime minister were away on holiday			1
and now it 's spreading , as @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and many other cities have burst into violence			0
the riots may have begun as a protest , but now they 're just mindless and brutal , with gangs roaming the streets in balaclavas , wielding bats and bottles			0
we were filming as monday 's mob sparked into action after police stopped and searched two men in front of a nervous crowd in @entity64 , @entity19			1
thirty minutes later , kids were tearing the street apart , smashing up opticians , sports shops , raiding supermarkets for ammo , attacking busses and looting a tree surgeon 's van for wooden weapons			1
see the rest of @entity64 : systems overload at @entity20 as the police have been overrun , most of the nation have submitted authority to the mob , with only @entity19 's @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 communities beating the crowd back from shops and mosques			1
by tuesday , many people were calling for the army to be deployed and a curfew to be brought in to combat the anarchy , but instead tonight the police were allowed to have a second go at controlling the streets			2
while only 6,000 cops were active on monday , yesterday 16,000 police armed with rubber bullets greeted any would - be rioters in @entity19			1
it was a tactic that paid off as the city became a ghost town , with only isolated disturbances			0
however , elsewhere in @entity103 it was a different matter			0
@entity104 saw sustained looting by more than a thousand youths , cars were torched in @entity46 , and three men died in @entity47 after being hit by a car as they defended their mosque .			0

police shooting of a man in @entity19 sparks protests that quickly turn violent
vice goes into the thick of rioting in @entity64
rioters smash *storefronts* , attack *vehicles* , loot for weapons and ammunition
