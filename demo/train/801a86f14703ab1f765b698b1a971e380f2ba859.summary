@entity1 had difficulty believing what was right before his eyes			0
@entity1 , an accountant who lives in @entity5 , @entity6 , was looking at a hospital bill he had found while going through the possessions of his late mother , @entity9			1
" i 'm kind of the family historian , " he told me			0
" what he was looking at was the bill for his own birth , in 1947			1
the bill had been mailed to his parents after they , and he , had left @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19 , in may of that year			2
the grand total for his mother 's six - day stay at @entity23 , for the use of the operating room , for his days in the nursery , for the various medicines and lab work -- for all aspects of his birth -- was $ 70			1
" it made me think , ' how did we get from that , to where we are today ? ' " @entity1 said			0
he was referring to the soaring costs of health care in the @entity37			0
for all the discussion of how out of hand the price of medical treatment has become , somehow that one old piece of paper put the subject in sharper focus for @entity1 than all the millions of words in news accounts analyzing the topic			2
10 ways falling off the fiscal cliff could hurt your health " it ca n't just be inflation , can it ? " he asked			0
no , it ca n't			0
according to the @entity37 @entity58 , $ 70 in 1947 would be equivalent to $ 726 in 2012 dollars			1
does it cost $ 726 for a hospital stay to deliver a baby these days ? dream on			1
according to a 2011 report from the @entity68 ( @entity68 ) , the cost for a hospital stay , including physician fees , for a conventional birth with no complications was a little over $ 11,000 in 2008 , the most recent year the report covered			1
for a birth involving a caesarean section , the cost was around $ 19,000			1
( while five - or six - day hospital stays were commonplace for mothers and newborns in the 1940s , today they routinely leave the hospital within 48 hours of childbirth -- so the higher costs are for shorter stays			2
) at @entity17 in @entity18 -- now called @entity83 -- a spokeswoman told me that the average cost for having a baby is around $ 15,000			2
so what exactly has happened , for costs to rise so astronomically ? a lot of things , said dr. @entity91 of the @entity92 in @entity93 , a former chair of @entity68 's obstetric practice committee			2
the technology available to keep mothers and babies safe is light years removed from what was available in 1947 , he said , and " regrettably , the technology is expensive			1
" he said that in almost every way , new mothers and their babies are better off now than they were 65 years ago			0
the antibiotics that have been developed to fight infections , the improved surgical procedures , the sophisticated anesthesia , the highly accurate electronic fetal monitors and other medical machinery -- all provide advantages for mother and child that did not exist in 1947			1
medical malpractice insurance premiums figure into the high cost of childbirth today , he said			0
and there are some physicians who question whether all procedures that are regularly performed , increasing costs , are routinely necessary			0
but for all the frustration that patients feel about the price of medical care , one fact is indisputable : the rate of infant mortality , and the rate of mortality for new mothers , has plummeted , said @entity91			1
in 1950 nearly 30 infants out of 1,000 died at or soon after birth ; in 2009 , that number was 6.4 out of 1,000 , according to the @entity68 report			0
it may be more expensive to give birth to a child today , but both the mother and child , if there is trouble during delivery , have a much better chance of survival than they once did			1
opinion : @entity147 needed for pregnant workers at @entity23 , where @entity1 was born , dr. @entity149 , medical director of women 's health , told me that " infection , blood clots , hemorrhage -- our ability to diagnose and treat all of these " is considerably better today			0
" you never know who that patient is going to be , " @entity149 said -- the mother or baby who suddenly requires all the resources a hospital maintains , at great expense , to save lives during delivery			0
i sent copies of @entity1 's childbirth bill to @entity91 and @entity149			2
both were amazed at the particulars : the hospital room charge for @entity173 was $ 7 per day , for six days			2
the cost for @entity1 to stay in the nursery was $ 2 per day			0
the flat rate for maternity service was $ 15			0
@entity179 , by the way , was not an anomaly ; a 1947 brochure from @entity182 in @entity6 , to use one example , listed a similar price structure for having a baby : $ 17.50 for maternity service , $ 2 per day for the nursery , an extra $ 15 if the birth was by cesarean section			1
and @entity1 , who came into this world for $ 70 ? he told me that last year , the cost of the health insurance he and his employer sign up for , covering him and his wife , was in excess of $ 18,000 -- and that was before a single visit to a physician , and before a single prescription was filled			1
" it just astonishes me that in our lifetime , we have seen such extremes in medical costs , " said @entity1 , who was one of more than 3.8 million @entity37 babies born in 1947			0
and who -- with that old hospital bill still in hand -- lived to tell the tale			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .			2

@entity213 's friend found the hospital bill from his birth in 1947 . it was $ 70 , $ 726 in 2012 dollars
he says the price of a hospital birth in 2008 was $ 11,000 . why is it so expensive now ?
he says huge pricetag is partly *due* to advanced technology that has greatly cut infant mortality
@entity213 : some say not all costly procedures necessary , but outcomes are better now
