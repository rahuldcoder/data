-- thousands of people turned out saturday in the southern @entity3 city of @entity4 for the funeral of politician @entity6 , a popular but polarizing figure who led right - wing @entity3 politics for decades			1
@entity10 , mayor of @entity4 , speaks in front of the coffin of @entity6 saturday			1
among those attending the service at the town 's central @entity16 square were @entity3 president @entity18 and chancellor @entity19			1
@entity6 's widow sat in the front row with her two daughters , all of them dressed in black			2
" many people expected things of @entity6 that they themselves were n't able to fulfill , and he too expected things of people that he was n't able to fulfill , " @entity19 said at the funeral			1
" therefore his death , and the end of his life , may be a time to think about whether death 's only consolation is that we can now reconcile things that seemed irreconcilable during his lifetime			0
" @entity6 's coffin was draped in the yellow , red and white flag of the southern state of @entity43 , where he was governor , and topped with red roses			2
@entity6 , 58 , died last saturday in a car accident while driving out of @entity4 , the state capital			1
he had just passed another car on a highway when his car hit a concrete post and rolled over several times , police said			0
his spokesman said this week that @entity6 was drunk at the time of the crash			1
besides being @entity43 's governor , @entity6 was also head of the right - wing @entity57 ( @entity58 ) , which he founded in 2005 after years with the conservative @entity59			1
@entity6 came to prominence in 1986 , when he became head of the @entity59 while still in his 30s			2
a politician who projected youth and style , @entity6 appealed to many working - class @entity3 , promising to cut their taxes and give money to those with children			1
some older @entity3 responded to his demands for strict law and order			2
but he drew widespread criticism both at home and abroad for his anti-immigrant stance and remarks considered anti-semitic , and in 1991 he publicly praised @entity80 's employment policy			1
asked in 2000 about the statement , @entity6 told @entity0 the quote was taken from a long speech and that he never praised the @entity80			1
he called the remarks a mistake and publicly denounced @entity85			0
but @entity6 continued to draw attention for his controversial remarks			2
they included an address to veterans of the @entity91 , @entity93 's elite soldiers , in which he praised their character			0
the address created an uproar after it was broadcast on @entity97 television			0
@entity6 said he had simply been speaking to elderly citizens of @entity43 who included some former @entity91 members			2
despite the controversy , @entity6 said he was not racist : " you will not find any anti-semitic position in our party program , and you will not find any anti-semitic speech or statement by me			2
" the policies of the @entity59 drew international attention during the elections in 1999			2
party campaign posters urged voters to stop the flood of immigration and used the term " over-foreignization , " the same word used by @entity80 propaganda minister @entity116 in 1933 to criticize what he called @entity119 influence in @entity80			0
@entity6 told @entity0 he favored restricting immigration simply because of @entity3 's small size , but that he wanted to keep an open border for refugees			1
it was his family background , @entity6 said , that kept singling him out for criticism			0
@entity6 's parents were activists in the @entity129 long before @entity3 - born @entity93 annexed @entity3 to @entity80 in 1938			1
@entity6 's father , @entity130 , volunteered for the @entity131 , the notorious brown shirts who terrorized @entity119 and others before the war			0
he then served in the @entity97 army			0
his biographer , @entity137 , said @entity6 felt a strong sense of loyalty to his parents and those in the war generation			0
" he feels that what they sacrificed after the war in rebuilding @entity3 in very difficult circumstances needs to be honored and that they were n't all criminals , " @entity143 told @entity0 in 2000			0
under @entity6 's leadership , the @entity59 made a strong showing in the 1999 elections , winning 27 percent of the vote and shaking up the traditional two - party system that had ruled @entity3 since @entity155 when the two main parties in that election failed to agree on forming a government together , the @entity59 was invited to share power			1
@entity6 retired as party leader after that but remained governor of @entity43			0
when @entity6 formed the @entity57 party three years ago , he took with him a number of @entity59 lawmakers			0
@entity6 was credited with helping the @entity57 make significant gains in last month 's general elections alongside the @entity59 , though @entity3 's two largest parties , the @entity168 and the @entity169 , came out on top			1
the vote reflected reflected public dissatisfaction with the two largest parties as well as support for the social populism , @entity176 and anti-immigrant rhetoric of the @entity57 and @entity59			0
