-- @entity1 was an idol for many a football fan , old and young			1
but in my town of @entity5 , @entity6 , he was n't merely a @entity7 running back who ran on average more than 1,000 yards for six seasons			1
no , @entity1 was a hometown hero			1
the city of @entity5 held an annual @entity13 , where he returned to the local high school ( his high school ) and taught hundreds of kids the basics of football			1
he was revered at city hall			1
the @entity20 made him the honored guest at the annual fundraiser			0
i attended that event , and fell in love with him			2
he was n't merely a football star — he was a normal guy who refused to forget his roots and gave back to the community			0
he truly inspired kids to work hard and stay in school			2
at one of the charity events , i bought my children a @entity35 helmet with @entity1 's signature in gold pen			1
they took turns visiting with the helmet , and keeping it in their rooms			0
i felt great supporting a charity and bringing @entity1 closer into our lives			1
this week , the full video of @entity1 slugging his fiancée ( now wife ) in an elevator , and then dragging her unconscious body out and leaving it on the floor , became public			1
suddenly i feel duped , dirty by association			0
i want that helmet exorcised from my house			0
but i ca n't just do that			0
i helped build @entity1 into the good guy / role model to my kids and now i have to explain to them why i am not proud of him			1
heroes have fallen before @entity1			1
all once adored , all with glory stripped when the public learned of their transgressions			0
with @entity1 , though , it feels different			1
we have never before had a video of a hero 's horrendous behavior available in such graphic , undeniable detail			1
with almost every middle - and high - schooler having a cell phone , the @entity1 video went viral before the kids came home on the school bus			1
how does an 11 - year - old interpret this : a big , strong football player knocking out his girlfriend , then barely lifting a finger to help her ? how can a 16 - year - old high school running back reconcile the unheroic man in the video with the guy on the poster on his bedroom wall ? this very complicated , very uncomfortable story offers parents an opportunity worth taking			2
who wants to sit down at dinner to discuss domestic violence ? you should			1
parents must have this conversation			0
here are five points to touch on , for starters : call it what it is			0
your kids should know the video depicts domestic violence			1
many kids wo n't know what this means			2
explain that it is when people in an intimate relationship become physically violent or emotionally cruel to their partner			1
there are any number of potential reasons : @entity1 and @entity120 appeared to be involved in a heated argument ; maybe he has a short fuse ; maybe it was some other reason altogether			1
there is nothing a person can say or do that would make it ok to hit that person			2
hitting a spouse , a partner , is unacceptable ; it 's never justified			2
it 's assault and is against the law			2
why would @entity1 become violent with his girlfriend ? the answer is : we really do n't know			1
domestic violence is a learned behavior			2
it is n't due to genetics , addiction or mental illness ( this is why this conversation is so important )			0
a person 's willingness to act on the urge to abuse a loved one may have roots in his family life growing up , his observation of the way intimate relationships among relatives , friends and others in the community are conducted , behaviors he 's observed in the media , and personal experience , especially if that included praise for aggression			1
why did she marry him after he abused her ? every case is different , but there are a few reasons that crop up repeatedly in research on domestic violence			2
men who batter are often — and this is hard to comprehend — very charming			0
after an incident of abuse , they are often contrite , apologetic and overtly loving , vowing never to repeat the behavior			2
however , abuse is cyclical			2
statistics show that most likely , without extensive treatment , an abuser will do it again			0
and time and time again , the victim will forgive the abuser			0
but as time passes the abuse will become more violent and more frequent			2
is he a bad guy ? @entity1 did a very bad thing			1
not because it was caught on tape but because he hit her , and no one has any right to hit another person			0
it is never a solution in a conflict			0
people are not necessarily good or bad			0
@entity1 has shown that he needs help			1
with counseling and perhaps other treatment -- and the desire to change -- many abusers can become good partners			0
but it takes work and commitment			0
will he go to jail ? @entity1 will probably not go to jail			1
he was given the opportunity to go to a program to help people on their first offense			0
if he is n't caught again , he will stay out of jail			0
parents should end the conversation by explaining some of the signs that a person is experiencing domestic violence or in a potentially dangerous relationship			0
tell them that if your partner isolates you , repeatedly puts you down , tries to control what you do and who you are with , or if you are sometimes afraid of getting hurt , it 's very important to share this with a parent , counselor or friend			0
@entity1 video prompts stories of # @entity234 , # whyileft domestic violence happens in all communities , in every religion and in every socioeconomic group			1
it can happen in married relationships , unmarried relationships , among the elderly , and in teen romances , too			0
make sure your children know , by watching you , what a loving relationship looks like			0
lastly , continue the conversation long after @entity1 has faded from the spotlight			1
when your children start thinking about dating , make sure to continue to let them know what a loving relationship is , what you expect from them , and what they should expect from a partner .			0

@entity258 : @entity1 was hometown hero in her town of @entity5
her kids , like many others , revered him . how to explain abusive video they *'ve* all seen ?
she says it 's crucial to discuss : explain what domestic abuse is ; that it 's never ok to hit
@entity258 : tell them people are complex , *flawed* , can be helped . demonstrate love at home
