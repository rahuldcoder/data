-- @entity2 legislators wo n't hold a special session to take another look at the state 's controversial " stand your ground " law			1
while 47 state lawmakers voted in favor of holding a special session to discuss the law , 108 voted against it , secretary of state @entity9 said in a letter tuesday			1
state law requires a three - fifths majority of both houses of the @entity19 to convene a special session , @entity9 said			1
the law drew national attention last year after @entity23 shot and killed @entity24			1
@entity23 's defense never cited " stand your ground " laws in its case , but jurors were instructed to consider them during deliberations in the high - profile trial			2
the jury acquitted @entity23 last month of all charges in the shooting of @entity24			0
but national debate over racial issues raised in the case and " stand your ground " laws has n't slowed			2
days after @entity23 's acquittal , a student - led group occupied @entity2 gov. @entity45 's office and asked him to call a special session to overturn the " stand your ground " law			1
@entity45 met with them a few days later to hear their demands but told them he would not call the special session			2
about 20 % of @entity2 's lawmakers had filed a request to convene a special session over the matter , @entity9 said			1
but a majority of lawmakers opposed that approach			0
" demands for a special session to repeal the law disregard the very foundation of our representative democracy by presuming that a law passed by the majority of a constitutional body should be reversed by the objections of a few , " @entity2 house speaker @entity61 wrote in an editorial published by the @entity63 earlier this month			1
@entity61 , a @entity74 , said he had asked a @entity76 committee to hold a hearing on the law this fall			0
" our evaluation of its effectiveness should be guided by objective information , not by political expediency , " he wrote			2
the @entity2 version of the law states , " a person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force , including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony			1
" eight other states have laws worded similarly , while 22 total states , including @entity2 , have laws stating that residents have no " duty " to retreat from a would - be attacker , according to the @entity111			0
civil rights groups attack the laws as racially motivated			0
@entity116 attorney general @entity115 said the laws " try to fix something that was never broken " and now encourage " violent situations to escalate in public			0
" but just as adamantly as the laws are decried , the @entity120 has stood by the measures it helped many states adopt. " the attorney general fails to understand that self - defense is not a concept ; it 's a fundamental human right , " said @entity123 , executive director of the @entity120 's @entity124			0
" to send a message that legitimate self - defense is to blame is unconscionable			0
" @entity0 's @entity130 contributed to this report .			0
