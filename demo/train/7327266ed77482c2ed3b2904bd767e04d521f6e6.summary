@entity0 -- the challenger in a hotly contested race for a @entity6 @entity5 seat in central @entity7 accused @entity9 rep. @entity8 on monday of using misleading edits in a campaign ad to distort his comments			1
former @entity7 state rep. @entity13 said the new ad by @entity8 's re-election campaign does n't accurately portray what the @entity17 candidate said			1
" religious fanatics try to take away our freedom -- in @entity23 , in @entity28 and right here in @entity7 , " says the narrator in the 30 - second @entity8 spot , which is cast on a background of @entity23 women in burqas , militants with machine guns , and maps of @entity28 and @entity23			1
the ad which began airing over the weekend shows @entity13 telling a @entity36 group : " wives , submit yourself to your own husband " and " she should submit to me			1
" but video of @entity13 's full comment , provided to @entity1 by his campaign from a 2009 address in @entity45 , @entity46 , seems to show a different picture of the candidate 's intent			1
" so , write a journal			0
second , find a verse			0
i have a verse for my wife			0
i have verses for my wife , " @entity13 goes onto say			2
" do n't pick the ones that say , ' she should submit to me			0
' it 's in the @entity60 , but pick the ones that you 're supposed to do			2
" so instead , ' love your wife , even as @entity66 loved the church and gave himself for it , ' as opposed to , ' wives submit yourselves to your husband			0
' she can pray that if she wants to , but do n't you pray it			0
" the @entity8 campaign dismissed questions monday over whether their editing had distorted the meaning of @entity13 's comments			1
" @entity13 is a member of this group , @entity76			2
that 's where he was speaking , " said @entity8 campaign spokesman @entity77			1
" they are a group that interpret the @entity60 literally			0
when @entity13 says ' she should submit to me ' is in the @entity60 , he believes that 's the truth , " @entity77 said			1
" he is explaining that women and children should be submissive to their husbands and fathers , but that the men have to earn it , not just expect it			0
" the @entity8 attack ad is the second in a matter of days to draw fire over factual claims			2
last week , the two - term @entity7 @entity98 's campaign released a spot dubbing @entity13 a " draft dodger , " during the @entity101			1
the ad cites a series of student deferments the @entity17 candidate received before reporting for duty			2
he was ultimately disqualified for medical reasons			0
