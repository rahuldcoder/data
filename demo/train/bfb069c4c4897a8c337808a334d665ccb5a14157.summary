-- tender , loving vampires ? look elsewhere than @entity3 's " @entity2			1
" the new thriller series , produced by @entity5 , @entity6 and author @entity7 , wants to make bloodsuckers scary again			1
" the vampire genre has sort of been overrun by romance , " @entity6 told reporters on a press call			1
" we had had our fill of vampires that we 're feeling sorry for because they had romantic problems			2
" instead , " @entity2 's " vampires lose their heart , their hair and their genital organs			1
when these vampires fully transition , there 's no mistaking them for the really pale guy in science class			1
for @entity6 , that was the selling point for hopping aboard			1
" the idea of sort of reimagining the vampires , going back to the roots of what vampires are -- that they are scary , dangerous creatures -- that was something that was incredibly compelling for me ; the idea that when you see these things , it 's not good			1
" an adaptation of @entity7 and @entity39 's books , " @entity2 , " premiering sunday , july 13 , begins with the mysterious deaths of passengers aboard an airplane that lands in @entity43			1
all but a few on the flight appear to be dead , and @entity46 epidemiologist dr. @entity45 ( @entity47 ) heads over to investigate with a few colleagues			0
but the wormy outbreak they 're examining is far more ancient and sinister then they realize -- and it is n't long before the horrific outbreak spreads			0
" i 've been obsessed by vampires for a long , long time , since i was a very young kid , and a very strange kid , " @entity39 said during the press call			2
" i read about vampire mythology worldwide and i familiarized myself with the @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity63 variations on the vampire , and many , many others			0
and i kept very detailed notes as a kid on where to go with the vampire myth in terms of brutality , social structure ( and ) biology			0
some of those notes made it into my first feature , ' @entity76			0
' some of them made it in ' @entity79 ' when i directed that , and most of them made it into ' @entity2			2
' " in del @entity5 's world , the undead do not sparkle , do not brood and do not hesitate to take out someone they once loved			1
in fact , the first thing to go is their heart			0
" the older that they stay alive , the more they lose their humanity , " del @entity5 explained			2
" they start literally by losing their heart ; their heart is suffocated by a vampire heart that overtakes the functions			0
this was important metaphorically for me because the beacon that guides these vampires to their victims is love			2
love is what makes them seek their victims			0
they go to the people they love the most			0
so they turn their instinct that is most innately human into the most inhuman feeding mechanism			0
" with " @entity2 " being on @entity3 , hardcore horror fans are likely skeptical that the drama can be as graphic as an r - rated movie would be			1
@entity6 told press that the network gave the producers " the latitude " to tell the story their way -- and critics have taken notice			1
" ' @entity2 ' is packed with so much macabre imagery and so many clever ideas that it does n't feel like the resuscitation of a tired genre , but the launch of something new and fun , " says @entity130 's @entity129			1
granted , like the show 's gross - out billboards , the producers ' commitment to " unadulterated " storytelling may not sit well with some viewers			2
" this is cult - classic , midnight - movie horror , designed in meticulous , mythology - respecting detail for comic - book readers and fangirls and - boys , " says @entity140			0
" the show is n't for everyone			0
but that special someone it is for ? she 's gon na love it			0
