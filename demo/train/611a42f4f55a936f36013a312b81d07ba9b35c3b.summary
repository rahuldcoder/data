-- @entity1 , a child of the @entity2 , spent her life saving everything -- literally			0
the @entity6 resident kept everything from newspapers and electronics to empty cigarette packets and sticky - notes			2
among the cardboard boxes and magazine stacks in her home were 140,000 cassette tapes containing recordings of all local and national tv news programs from every channel			1
@entity1 spent 35 years recording the news 24 hours a day , 7 days a week			1
that amounts to 840,000 hours of videotaped news			0
with help from her family and a personal assistant , @entity1 systematically recorded the news at her home until her death at age 83 in december 2012			0
she left her collection of tapes — her " life 's work " — to her only son , @entity33			1
she gave him no specific instruction but told him that he could donate them to a charity of his choice			0
on tuesday , @entity1 ' cassette tapes will arrive at the @entity40 , a nonprofit organization in @entity41 , after a cross-country journey in four large shipping containers			1
the organization will digitize all 140,000 tapes into a public , searchable online archive			1
the $ 2 million project will take about 20 digitizing machines , volunteers working around the clock , funding and several years to complete , @entity33 said			1
@entity52 said he always knew what his mother wanted to do with the tapes			0
he called his mother a private yet persistent woman who believed that if the public had access to good information , they would make good decisions			2
@entity1 , a tv producer , librarian and political activist , took it upon herself to preserve hundreds of thousands of hours of televised news in hopes of one day making these tapes a repository of knowledge available to the public			1
now , nearly one year after her death , @entity52 is finishing what his mother started in 1977 when she bought her first videotape recorder			2
" i feel confident that maintaining a family connection and supporting the archive to whatever degree we can and working with them , we 're helping preserve my mother 's legacy , " said @entity33 , who temporarily moved back to @entity6 from @entity74 before @entity1 died			2
it took some time to decide on a home for his mother 's tapes , and @entity52 worried the entire collection would be too big of a project for one organization			1
he was overjoyed when the @entity40 's director , @entity89 , said the group would take them all			2
" i almost teared up at how grateful i was			0
it 's just amazing that someone can use everything that my mother did , " @entity33 said			0
for several years , @entity1 and her husband traveled back and forth between houses in @entity6 and @entity97 , until finally settling permanently in @entity6 in the late 1980s			1
but this did n't prevent @entity1 from recording the news ; in fact , it allowed her to document historical events like the @entity97 busing crisis			0
it 's this unique collection of local and national news that makes @entity1 ' tapes so " remarkable , " wrote @entity89 in a blog post for the @entity40			1
" her dream of using this collection for the public good can now be fulfilled , " @entity89 wrote			0
@entity89 could not be reached for additional comment .			0
