@entity0 , @entity1 -- the lane closure scandal rocking @entity1 gov. @entity5 's administration is raising questions whether gridlock delayed paramedics ' effort to save a 91 - year - old woman who was in cardiac arrest and later died			1
" this crosses a line that is rarely crossed : people 's lives were in danger , " said @entity1 state sen. @entity14 , a @entity15			1
" endangering people 's lives -- that 's not politics			1
that 's why the @entity24 attorneys have to get involved			2
" @entity14 is asking for federal prosecutors to open an investigation into whether the lane closures were a factor in the woman 's death			1
her daughter told @entity2 affiliate @entity33 that she did n't believe the traffic trouble was a factor in @entity37 's death			1
" i really do n't think so , no , i really do n't			0
i think she was 91 and really believe in my heart that she was already gone when the ambulance got ( to her house ) , " @entity38 told the station			2
the investigation also would look into allegations that aides to @entity5 , a @entity47 , closed lanes at the @entity49 as retaliation against the mayor of @entity0 , a @entity15 who did n't endorse @entity5 's re-election campaign			1
the delays to paramedics were red - flagged on the second day of the lane closures last september when @entity57 coordinator @entity56 wrote a letter to the mayor saying the snarled traffic was " causing unnecessary delays for emergency services			2
" in two emergency calls , response time was doubled because of the traffic jams , @entity56 wrote			0
@entity5 drops swagger amid heat of scandal among two other delays listed in the letter was the cardiac arrest of the elderly woman			1
on september 9 , @entity74 personnel received a call about an unconscious 91 - year - old woman , and the response time was seven minutes because of traffic , @entity56 said in his letter			1
the delay could have been longer , but because paramedics were already heading to an unrelated incident reported one minute earlier , they were able to shorten the delay in reaching the elderly woman , @entity56 said			1
" the result of this call was a cardiac arrest , which was pronounced at @entity86 , " @entity56 wrote			1
" i would also like it noted that the paramedics were delayed due to heavy traffic on @entity90 and had to meet the ambulance en route to the hospital instead of on the scene			0
" @entity56 did not indicate what the response for the call on the elderly woman should have been , but he pointed out details from the incident reported one minute earlier			0
that one was a motor vehicle accident with injuries			0
@entity56 arrived on that scene in seven minutes , when it should have taken him less than four minutes , he said			0
an @entity74 crew arrived in nine minutes , he said			2
four people in that accident were transported to the hospital , he said			0
@entity5 bridge scandal : a primer in summarizing a total of four delayed emergency responses on september 9 and september 10 , @entity56 urged mayor @entity110 to take action			0
" i am bringing this to your attention so that perhaps some type of modification of change can be made to this new traffic pattern , so we can possibly avoid any further delayed response times to emergencies throughout the borough , " @entity56 wrote in the letter , dated september 10			0
@entity56 could n't be reached for comment thursday			0
on the bridge : ' those days ... worse than a disaster ' @entity2 's @entity127 reported from @entity1 , and @entity128 wrote and reported from @entity129 .			2
