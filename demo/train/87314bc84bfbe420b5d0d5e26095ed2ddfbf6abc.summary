-- " when you and i went to dinner in @entity6 in the spring of 2011 , " i say to @entity2 , general manager of the @entity3 , " you thought your team might be a lot better than it turned out to be			1
" " it tells you that i do n't know what i 'm doing , " he jumps in , finishing my thought			2
" and when we went to dinner in @entity14 before this season , " i remind him , " you sure as hell were n't sure your 2012 team had a shot to be the best team in baseball			1
" @entity2 is cool about being kidded because he 's been around long enough to know how high and low and fast and slow and screwy and curvy and uncontrollable baseball can be			2
bankruptcy court approves sale of @entity3 he says , " well , how 's that saying go , ' the whole is greater than the sum of its parts ? ' " everything that goes wrong one year can go right the next			1
every guy who hit .200 can hit .300			2
every guy on the @entity31 can be an mvp			2
every team 's owner who files for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection can sell that same team for $ 2 billion and change			1
well , ok , not every team			1
but maybe the @entity3 are too big to fail			1
maybe you ca n't keep a franchise this strong down too long			2
maybe the bum breaks even out			2
maybe a new owner and a new cash infusion and a new attitude can create a new mood			2
i can tell you this much : for years and years before the last owner owned the @entity3 , the @entity3 owned this town			1
the team took five @entity52 championships and nine @entity54 pennants after bolting @entity55 to go west			1
if you count the @entity55 years , these boys of summer won six fall classics and 22 pennants			2
something happened to the club that brought you @entity62 and @entity63 and @entity64 and @entity65 , alas			2
rare photos of @entity62 an organization that oozed success and epitomized class was being abandoned by some of its fan base			2
the seats were n't filled			2
the team was n't succeeding			1
its owner was in divorce court and its financial statements were in bankruptcy court			1
a lawsuit and a criminal investigation were pending over a parking lot incident in which a @entity82 man was beaten into a coma			2
@entity85 attendance in 2011 was down more than 627,000 from the year before			1
i wondered what it would take for the @entity3 to straighten this out			1
would it take years ? would thousands of fans who once jammed the freeway near @entity93 now steer clear for good ? well , they are n't totally back , the team or the fans , but you 've got to admit , it 's getting better			1
for much of this season , @entity14 ( that famous ice hockey town ) has owned the best record in all of ball			2
i know quite a few folks who thought the @entity14 team of @entity105 might become a dominating one in 2012 , what with having signed the @entity108 of @entity110 @entity109 to a contract through the year 2022 or 2032 or 2525 or whatever it was they did			1
but the @entity3 ? no way			1
after all , what did they have ? they had a hard - hitting hitter , @entity117 , who might have been his league 's legitimate @entity119 last season , having come in second in a vote to a guy who later was accused of using a banned substance			2
they had a hard - throwing thrower , @entity126 , who was indeed his league 's most valuable pitcher , having racked up a record of 21 - 5			2
they had a left - handed swinger , @entity132 , whose production had tapered off sharply in 2011 after a hot start			2
and ... ? they had a team that ended up 11.5 games out of first place			1
they had an owner fans resented , with a big " @entity143 " sign in the yard			0
a much - loved ballclub and ballpark suddenly had five popular people -- @entity117 , @entity126 , @entity132 , a certain redheaded gentleman in the radio - tv booth ( initials @entity150 ) and a nice lady named @entity152 who plays the organ			0
how low would they go ? it was n't as if the @entity3 had n't been down on their luck before			1
on october 29 , 2005 , the owner fired his general manager			0
he was @entity159 ( aka the true identity of the @entity162 character from " @entity163 " ) , who , for all his calculations and acumen , had just fielded a @entity3 team that won 71 of 162 games			1
his teams proceeded to go to the playoffs of 2006 , 2008 and 2009			0
he had money to spend			0
he tinkered , he tweaked			0
@entity132 was acquired in a december 2005 trade			0
@entity126 was drafted in june of 2006			0
there were signings and experiments that did not pan out , but there was also @entity177 , who was acquired by @entity2 from the @entity178 in mid- 2008 and turned the whole left field pavilion into his own personal " @entity177			1
" in the first rounds of the ' 08 and ' 09 playoffs , the @entity3 not only beat the @entity182 and @entity183 , they swept them			1
that 2009 team had a record of 95 - 67			1
it was the first @entity3 club since the championship run of 1988 to win that many			1
ah , but prior to that 2009 @entity54 championship series , snap , things changed			0
it was announced that owners @entity192 and @entity194 were kaput			1
as soon as the @entity3 were eliminated , @entity196 eliminated @entity194 as the club 's ceo			1
that same month , she filed for divorce			1
a day after she did , @entity196 's side claimed @entity194 had a guy on the side			0
husband gets @entity3 in @entity194 divorce deal what a mess			1
there were good players ( @entity209 , @entity210 ) who were not offered new contracts			0
there were players ( @entity214 ) who got traded , players ( @entity177 ) who got put on waivers and permitted to leave			0
you could n't help but interpret it as the @entity3 cutting costs			1
their catcher ( @entity220 ) was not offered a new deal , even though no heir - apparent was apparent			0
@entity223 ( $ 13 million salary in 2011 ) , @entity225 ( nearly $ 12 million ) , @entity226 ( $ 7 mil ) ... those guys , too , had to go			0
critics and skeptics no longer saw the @entity2 who landed productive guys like @entity232 and @entity233 without giving up much in return			0
they focused instead on risks like @entity236 and @entity237 who did n't produce			0
i told people that the @entity242 , given resources , could field a team that true - blue @entity3 followers were proud of again			1
@entity246 did n't return until @entity247 and associates laid their billions on the table , making @entity194 green but gone			0
happy days were here again			0
soon , these solvent @entity3 would surely solve all of the fans ' woes , from finding a new third baseman to fixing the long traffic jams and the long lines for a hot dog			1
@entity259 , just like that			0
and on the field ? well , there was no waiting			1
@entity2 did what he could			0
there were new arms , like those of @entity268 and @entity269			0
there were the unrelated @entity271 ( catcher @entity272 and infielder @entity273 ) who were much better than anyone anticipated			0
there was a battle - tested bat ( @entity278 's ) that the @entity242 went out and got			0
best team in baseball ? maybe not			1
best record in baseball ? you bet			0
as i watched a victory parade thursday morning through the streets of @entity14 , the ice skate guys were kings for a day , i looked at the baseball standings in the paper			0
only one team had won 40 games already in 2012			1
it was n't the @entity292			0
it was n't the @entity294			0
it was n't the @entity297 champion @entity183 , who had lost @entity109			0
( see how quickly fortunes can change ? ) it was the @entity3			1
" i would n't even use words like ' best team in baseball ' because there 's no such thing , " @entity2 tells me on the phone , grateful for a good start but understandably cautious			2
" in our case , we 're a good example of a bunch of guys who get out there and give you everything they 've got			0
" oh , and there 's something else some of them got : @entity117 's got a big new contract			0
@entity126 's got a big new contract			0
@entity132 's got a big new contract			0
@entity14 is a player again in the baseball business			0
it might not be a hockey town for very long			0
