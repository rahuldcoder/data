-- @entity1 tuned up perfectly for the forthcoming masters with a two - shot victory at the @entity4 in @entity5 as he edged closer to overhauling the world no. 1 @entity6			1
the 14 - time major champion started the final round at the @entity11 course at @entity12 with a four - shot lead and never looked like relinquishing it , despite the best efforts of @entity16 and @entity17			1
the world @entity18 dropped a shot on the final hole to finish on 19 - under - par , two clear of @entity17 , who had given @entity1 a few putting tips before the tournament started and might now wish he had n't			1
it was @entity1 ' seventh triumph in the @entity26 , his 17th @entity27 and his 76th @entity29 title			1
" i played well this week , " @entity1 said at the trophy presentation			2
" thank you to @entity17 for the putting lesson			2
it was one of those weeks where i felt pretty good about how i was playing			0
i made some putts and pretty much got rolling			0
" the 2010 @entity36 champion @entity35 started the final round in second but endured a testing afternoon , dropping back to 14 - under as he finished in third alongside @entity16 , @entity40 @entity39 and @entity42 @entity41			1
woods carded three birdies in his first ten holes but dropped two shots on the closing holes , including on the final hole			2
yet he looks to have regained some of his best form with the first major tournament of the year -- the masters at @entity53 -- just round the corner			1
@entity6 , who caused controversy by walking off the course during last week 's @entity57 was back to his best form , firing a seven - under - par round of 65 as he charged up the leaderboard to finish in a tie for eighth place			1
" i was pretty down about my game coming into this week , " @entity6 told the @entity29 's official website			2
" a day like today felt like a long way away if i 'm honest			0
" " a few days like i 've played , it does my confidence a world of good			0
i probably wear my heart on my sleeve a bit with my golf			0
if i have a bad round , it 's sort of like the @entity74 , but if i play a good one , i 'm happy again			0
" i always think when i 'm playing bad that it 's further away than it is , " @entity6 added			0
" that 's just where i have to stay patient and let whatever happens , happen , and know that if i put in the hard work , that the results will bear fruit ; whether that 's sooner or later , it does n't really matter			0
