-- " @entity5 " is n't exactly a sequel , but it does continue to thrill with new distinctive artwork , a more descriptive speech mechanic and a combat system that feels intuitive and destructive at the same time			1
where " @entity6 : origins " told the tale of a @entity9 's trek to gather allies , stem the tide of the malevolent @entity12 ( a wave of evil creatures bent on taking over ) and do battle against an arch - demon , " @entity5 " ( @entity20 , @entity21 ) showcases another wave of the story			1
it starts with a family fleeing the @entity12			1
think of it as a branch off the " origins " story tree to expand the " @entity6 " universe			1
you play as @entity30 -- either a warrior , mage or rogue ( player 's choice ) who is escaping with his mother , sister and brother			2
the prologue does a great job of teaching combat and movement mechanics , but you also suffer your first tragedy as a family member succumbs to the @entity12			1
this pushes the story away from @entity30 's homeland of @entity6 to the @entity49 , @entity50			1
it is there that the adventure begins in earnest , and it serves as your home base for most of the game			1
having played " origins " on the pc , i was immediately struck by the new artwork design of some familiar characters			1
the @entity62 , which are the grunt element of the @entity12 , used to look similar to orcs or goblins from " @entity66 " movies			1
now , they appear to be more skeletal with an almost undead look to them			2
@entity70 , creative director for the " @entity6 " series , said the game is character - driven and the team wanted the races to look unique			2
" we did n't want to fall in the trap of all of the races to be humans with funny ears , " he said			2
" ultimately , ' @entity6 ' needs its own distinct look			2
one of the dangers of fantasy is , there is so much out there that it is easy to lump it all together into an elf / orc mishmash , and we wanted to stand apart			2
" @entity70 credits @entity88 , the art director for " @entity5 , " with bringing a fresh , new look to the races and a desire to make the characters truly unique			1
" i think there were elements of ' origins , ' especially in the appearances , that were technical masterpieces , " @entity70 explained			2
" but @entity99 felt that they were n't standing out enough			2
they were n't creating their own space and colonizing their visual identity in the way that he wanted			2
" the @entity106 , a warlike race that originally appeared as large humans , also got a makeover			2
they retained their size and aggressive appearance , but they also sprouted horns similar to a gazelle or , as @entity70 points out , an ogre			0
one of the driving forces in the game is the interaction between the player character and his allies and other non-player characters			0
talking between characters is done through a series of choices that allow the player to take different postures in the discussions			0
the speech choices are now shown with an icon that indicates the tone in which the character will speak			1
@entity70 said that in " origins , " a player could n't tell whether the choices would come out as sarcastic or aggressive and may have chosen a response that they ended up not wanting			0
" we wanted a mix of the paraphrase , so you could see what you were going to say , and the statement of intent , " he said			0
" while some of them are just tone , knowing when you are going to be funny is really key , especially when that is one of the principal tones of the game			0
" there are icons for peaceful / helpful , funny , aggressive , hard , romance and others			0
i found myself using helpful and funny answers more than others			0
@entity70 said the game recognizes those tendencies and adjusts character reactions as the game goes on			0
" for example , if you find yourself constantly being a smart - aleck or making jokes , you 'll find in combat that your battle cries will change			1
it does create a consistency of character along those core choices			0
" @entity70 explained that it gives gamers a greater sense of control over their characters to shape them the way they want and a create deeper sense of immersion in the game			0
the game uses a recurring interrogation scene as part of its narrative , a move @entity70 says is intended to add perspective and depth to character development and movement of the story			1
@entity191 , a dwarven crossbow expert and ally of @entity30 's , is being questioned by @entity193 , a @entity194 seeking answers to some unnamed , yet often foreshadowed , tragedy surrounding @entity30			0
chapters of the game 's story start and finish in the interrogation room , with @entity191 leading into or wrapping up the action and @entity193 reacting to what she 's hearing			1
it is an interesting technique and gives the game a television series feel , complete with recaps and previews			0
i almost felt like it was time for a commercial break to raid the fridge			1
it is n't necessary to have played " origins " to enjoy , and progress in , " @entity5 " but developers wanted it to retain the first game 's history			1
players who begin play having already saved a game of " origins " will see differences in certain parts of the story -- from who is on the throne to the political and social situation in other kingdoms			1
game play on the @entity232 console feels clean and smooth , with very few hiccups or lag			1
the outdoor environments are colorful and detailed , but the underground caves and caverns start to feel similar , with lots of identical layouts			0
combat on the major gaming consoles utilizes two levels of mapable buttons for skills and spells , while a shortcut bar offers more choices on the pc version			1
controlling the party 's actions seems easier on the pc than the console , but it can be done with some practice			0
battles are as visceral and graphic as ever and the " persistent gore " setting returns , which makes for some awkward conversations			0
trying to pay attention to an important bit of information is made more difficult when you are thinking , " you 've got a bit of ogre on your chin			0
" the tactics system is carried over from " origins , " allowing you to set up character actions to occur at pre-determined thresholds or events			1
characters can be set up to drink a healing potion when their health gets low without any break in the battle or gamer involvement			0
" the combat is still tactical , still requires you to think as a team and not just as one character , " @entity70 said			2
there is no " there 's the big bad guy , go get him " mentality to how the game unfurls			0
it is an interactive story that allows players to grow their characters organically , from the aspects of both combat and personal development			1
and it is n't a game if you 're just looking for a quick turn on the console or @entity251			0
the action occurs over numerous quests , side quests and personal missions that can easily chew up 30 - plus hours on a weekend as you try to complete " just one more quest			0
" " i never want to give players all the answers , " @entity70 said			0
" i think the mystery , the sense that this world is richer and deeper than just one game helps keep it more vital , more vibrant in terms of player experience			0
" whether you play as the dashing hero romancing every woman you meet or the hard , rough - and tumble - hero who smashes first and forgets to ask questions later , " @entity5 " has more than enough action , drama and suspense to keep fans of the fantasy gaming genre pleased			1
" @entity5 " comes out on march 8 in @entity322 and march 11 in @entity323 on the @entity232 , @entity324 , pc and mac. it is rated m -- mature ( 17 + ) for blood and gore , language , sexual content , and violence			1
this review was done playing the demo on the pc and the retail game on the @entity232 .			0
