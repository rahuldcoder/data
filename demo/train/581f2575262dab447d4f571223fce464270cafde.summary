-- members of @entity2 working to pass immigration reform are divided on many issues , but there 's one they agree on			1
@entity6 and @entity7 , virtually all have been adamant since the debate began that president @entity10 should stay out of it -- that pressure from the @entity13 would only spur resistance on @entity15			1
still , there 's an exception to every rule			0
the president has the power to transform the immigration debate by one simple action : nominating a tough , law - enforcement @entity7 to replace @entity23 as secretary of @entity25			1
the prospects of passing reform hang uneasily in the balance this month as members of @entity2 spend time at home in their districts			1
back in @entity40 , an all but unbreakable @entity13 rule mandates that passage of any law as momentous as immigration reform requires a " majority of the majority " -- in today 's @entity13 , 118 @entity7 votes			1
and many @entity41 € ” a majority , i believe -- are still up for grabs			0
in the past , many @entity13 @entity7 have opposed immigration reform , but attitudes have changed dramatically in recent months , thanks largely to a new understanding of the latino vote 's power			1
a dwindling minority still oppose reform at all cost			0
a growing but still small minority is generally favorable to an overhaul			0
and the rest -- the majority in the middle -- are wrestling to come to terms with an issue they 're suddenly seeing in a new light			0
they are reexamining the facts , questioning old assumptions , trying on new policy ideas and asking themselves how far they can stretch			0
the ferment is palpable -- as are the possibilities			0
opinion : key to immigration reform -- worker visas the biggest obstacle : @entity13 @entity7 do n't trust that @entity10 will enforce the law			1
this mistrust has deep roots , and @entity10 has only inflamed it in recent years			2
the last time @entity2 passed an immigration overhaul , in 1986 , it was cast as a grand bargain : amnesty for the millions of immigrants then living in the country illegally in exchange for tough enforcement on the border and in the workplace			1
by the early 1990s , 3 million formerly unauthorized immigrants had earned legal status and were on their way to citizenship			0
but the border was more porous than ever , and workplace enforcement had all but ground to a halt , as a new cottage industry in forged identity documents erased all hope of meaningful control and a frustrated immigration service threw up its hands			2
enter president @entity10 , who from day one has shown what @entity13 @entity7 consider a decidedly selective approach to the law			1
whatever you think of @entity107 or the @entity108 , they are the law of the land -- but the president has enforced them only when he felt like it , if he felt like it at all -- putting a hold , for example , on the @entity107 employer mandate			0
on other issues , he has thumbed his nose at the @entity120 's federal balance of power , bypassing @entity2 to appoint members of the @entity122 and grant legal status to young immigrants brought to the @entity125 as children			2
as for immigration enforcement , there has been some progress in the @entity10 years on the border and in the workplace , but two huge congressional directives remain just that , unfulfilled directives			1
one is completing the 700 miles of fence mandated in 2006 , the other building an electronic " exit " system to track that foreigners visiting the @entity125 on visas leave the country when they say they will -- a mandate that dates to 1996			0
there 's nothing @entity10 can do to restore @entity7 ' faith in him -- that horse left the barn years ago			1
and not any @entity7 appointment to the top immigration enforcement job will reassure the @entity7			1
a @entity7 seen as a dove on immigration will change nothing -- might as well go with a @entity6			1
so , too , a @entity7 popular in the mainstream media or among sophisticated elites , and that rules out even accomplished law enforcement officials like , say , @entity157 , former police commissioner in @entity159 and @entity160 , or @entity161 , now the top cop in @entity159			2
opinion : crunch time for immigration , budget fights what 's needed is someone so reliably tough and so committed to enforcing the law that even diehard immigration hawks do a double - take when the name surfaces			1
part of the point , after all , is neutralizing criticism from immigration restrictionists			0
and of course , such a choice will make many democrats gasp			0
that , too , is part of the point			0
without it , skeptical @entity7 will not be convinced			2
the other indispensable requirement is that a nominee should be someone with enough national stature -- a household name , if possible -- to push back against the president if need be			0
@entity13 @entity7 need to know that this person will hold the line , no matter what the president tries , will take his or her case to the media if necessary , and will have enough popular support to make a national appeal effective			2
who fits this bill ? it 's not a long list			0
would @entity197 take the job ? @entity199 ? a respected general ? someone who proved his law and order bona fides in the last @entity205 administration -- former attorney general @entity206 , for example ? or former sen. @entity208 of @entity209 , a committed immigration enforcement hawk and among the @entity7 lawmakers , sitting or retired , most knowledgeable about the issue ? coming up with the right name wo n't be easy , but ultimately this is a question about @entity10			1
is he strong enough -- and self - confident enough -- to take this step ? can he brook the dissent and give up control ? if he means what he says when he talks about enforcing the law , he should put his money where his mouth is			2
nothing would do more to improve the chances of passing immigration reform on his watch			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity228			0

@entity228 : @entity10 can help immigration debate by *picking* tough @entity25 secretary
she says he should pick a well - regarded @entity7 to win trust of @entity7 on reform
she says @entity2 , returning from break , will respond to gesture when debate *resumes*
@entity228 : @entity197 , @entity241 , @entity206 ? one could spur reform . can @entity10 give up control and do it ?
