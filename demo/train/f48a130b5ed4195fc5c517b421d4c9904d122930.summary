who is @entity1 ? who is @entity3 , a woman who 's been tied to the @entity6 leader ? and what would she be doing in @entity8 , now purportedly in custody of authorities there ? those are some of the many questions about reports of the arrest of a woman that regional sources describe as @entity1 's wife , @entity18 , but who @entity20 's @entity19 said wednesday is anything but			1
what makes the situation even murkier is how little is known about @entity25			0
yes , he heads the self - declared @entity27 , leading a group that has used brutal tactics -- think beheading innocents , kidnapping civilians , raping women -- to overtake vast swaths of @entity34 and @entity20			0
yes , he fashions himself as a spiritual authority as he spearheads efforts to spread his group 's extreme form of @entity41 law to any territory it touches , and to punish nonbelievers along the way			2
but @entity25 the man is a mystery			0
and so is his family , his wife or wives included			2
which brings us back to the woman being held by @entity8 authorities			1
is she not his wife , as the @entity20 ministry suggests , or perhaps an ex-wife , as @entity60 sources in @entity61 say ? or is she a " powerful figure ( who is ) heavily involved in @entity6 , " as a source with knowledge of her arrest told @entity68 ? and if it 's the latter , what role did she play in the terrorist group ? and what was she doing in @entity8 , a country on the fringes of @entity34 's years - long civil war ? she 's his wife , or his ex-wife , or neither the reported detention of a wife and child of @entity25 has made many wonder who exactly the woman is and what she might know about the terrorist group 's inner workings			1
authorities in @entity8 , where the woman was arrested , have n't officially commented on the matter			1
neither has the @entity90 , amid suggestions that @entity93 intelligence was involved in her capture			0
but the @entity98 , citing a source in an intelligence cell under its authority , said the woman 's identity did n't match up with either of the names it has for @entity25 's two wives , @entity104 and @entity105			1
" there is no wife named @entity3 , " the ministry stated bluntly , saying @entity18 is the sister of a man who is imprisoned in @entity20 and has been sentenced to death for a series of bombings			0
it does n't help that @entity1 's family life is cloaked in mystery			0
a biography posted on jihadist websites last year gave little away , stating simply that he was " married			0
" @entity68 was told that @entity25 has two wives			1
the news agency @entity121 , citing tribal sources in @entity20 , said he has three			0
and @entity6 certainly is n't confirming anything			1
some of its members took to social media tuesday to deny that any wife of @entity25 had been arrested			0
she wielded power , but how much ? if the woman is indeed @entity135 , she is " very active " in the organization , a regional source with knowledge of the operation told @entity68			1
she was reported to have previously been held by the @entity34 regime of president @entity138			0
in march , @entity18 was released from @entity34 custody as part of a group of 150 women who were freed in return for a group of @entity34 nuns , an intelligence source told @entity68			1
but her apparent attempt to cross into @entity8 with a child at a time when authorities there are tightening security around the border raises questions about the state of her relationship with @entity25			1
" is he estranged from them ? has he fallen out with them ? were they escaping from him ? " asked @entity162 , the international security director at the @entity163			0
uncertainty also remains about how much influence @entity18 would have had within @entity6 , which is known for its oppressive treatment of women			1
analysts say women who join @entity6 may find their role limited to that of housewife for jihadi men			2
but in february , @entity6 formed @entity174 , a female battalion with about 60 members whose job is to inspect women who pass through checkpoints and to enforce the organization 's strict morality code for women			1
she could reveal vital intelligence , or hardly anything the arrest of @entity18 , if it was her , was a coordinated operation involving intelligence agencies from @entity20 , @entity34 and @entity8 , an intelligence source familiar with the arrest told @entity68			1
the source said the @entity20 had help from the @entity60 intelligence community , an account corroborated by a second source in the region with knowledge of the operation			2
but in @entity61 , the @entity90 had no comment on the matter			0
rep. @entity197 , a @entity199 @entity198 , expressed confidence that the @entity60 would be able to " gain some intelligence " from @entity18			0
" we may get insights into @entity25 's movement , who he surrounds himself with , whether he was injured , and the degree of his injuries , " he said , referring to recent reports that @entity25 was hurt in airstrikes			2
not everyone was convinced she would provide a treasure trove of insight into @entity6 , though			2
expressing skepticism , a former senior @entity60 military official told the @entity216 that in the @entity20 war , the @entity60 captured a wife of @entity219 , the leader or @entity221 in @entity20 , @entity6 ' forerunner			1
" we got little out of her , and when we sent her back , @entity219 killed her , " the unidentified official told the newspaper			0
and since @entity18 was reportedly seized more than a week ago , what intelligence she carried may already have passed its sell - by date			0
" in military conflicts , information flows are very immediate , and they become yesterday 's news very quickly , " said @entity230 , a @entity231 research fellow at the @entity232 in @entity233			0
she was with a son , or a daughter the identity of the child with @entity18 is still the subject of conflicting reports			1
an intelligence source told @entity68 that the child was @entity18 's 4 - year - old son			1
other news organizations , including @entity246 and the @entity247 , also reported that it was a young boy			0
but @entity121 , which originally reported the same thing , later revised its reporting to say that she was with a daughter			0
the @entity216 also said it was a daughter rather than a son			2
deepening the intrigue , one regional source even told @entity68 that @entity1 himself has been calling up , asking for his son to be released			1
the full picture of who exactly @entity8 authorities have in their custody is still to be revealed .			2

there are conflicting reports on many details about the woman *detained* in @entity8
some intelligence officials have said she 's the @entity6 leaders ' wife , others say an ex-wife
a source tells @entity68 she was with a son , but other reports suggest it was a daughter
