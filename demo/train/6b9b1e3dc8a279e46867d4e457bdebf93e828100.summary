@entity0 , @entity1 -- the announcement that @entity4 has decided to end its marketing relationship with @entity6 -- now that the superstar is making headlines for his infidelity and sudden break from the sport of golf -- is raising larger doubts about the strategy of relying on celebrity endorsers			1
why would any firm center its marketing efforts on an athlete , particularly in today 's media landscape in which a celebrity 's missteps are so easily captured and disseminated via gossip and social - networking web sites ? would it not be better for firms to shy away from aligning themselves with celebrity endorsers ? while the strategy is inherently risky -- endorsers are people , after all , and people make mistakes -- and while @entity4 's decision to cut ties with @entity6 is probably justified given the circumstances , in general , the rewards of relying on endorsers very likely far outweigh the risks			1
endorsers often create tremendous value for the companies that rely on their services -- that is why the best endorsers are so richly compensated , and why most top athletes in @entity47 make more money from sponsorships than from salary or winnings			2
marketers of brands that employ the services of celebrities will know that few promotional strategies can impact the bottom line as much as -- and as quickly as -- forming an alliance with a celebrity			0
in a recent study in which i analyzed hundreds of athlete endorsements , i found that sales for brands in a variety of consumer - product categories jumped an average of 4 percent in the six months following the start of an endorsement deal , even after controlling for advertising expenditures and other factors that could be expected to drive up sales			1
several brands saw sales rise with more than 20 percent after teaming up with an endorser			0
and important to managers , the strategy seemingly helps to differentiate brands from their competitors , which did not experience any spillover of increased sales			0
the study , co-authored with @entity84 , even showed that the stock market favorably responds to athlete endorsements : on the day such a deal is announced , the endorsed firm 's stock can be expected to increase nearly a quarter percent			1
and illustrating the payoff of betting on a winning athlete , stock prices further increase every time the athlete secures a major victory , such as a pga championship			1
in fact , athletes with a strong track record emerged as particularly effective endorsers in the study in almost all possible respects			0
why do celebrity endorsements work as well as they do ? one obvious explanation is that celebrities help firms to tap into their fan base			1
consider tennis star @entity109 , one of today 's most sought - after -- and , as our research shows , most effective -- endorsers : the mere fact that @entity109 promotes fashion label @entity114 may encourage her most devoted fans to visit its shops , allowing @entity114 to perhaps attract a younger and more diverse demographic			1
a second , more subtle , explanation is that endorsements trigger sales by reassuring consumers of the quality of the endorsed brand			1
consumers often can not easily assess the true quality of products , at least not before they consume them			2
but seeing a celebrity attaching his or her name and good reputation to a product may help alleviate some of their uncertainty			0
consciously or unconsciously , they might trust , say , @entity109 to endorse @entity138 tennis rackets only if those products truly are of premium quality			2
after all , @entity109 herself would be at risk of damaging her reputation if that were not the case			0
a third possibility is that an alliance with an endorser can convey important information about an attribute that helps differentiate a brand from its competitors			0
this is particularly helpful for attributes that are hard to explain , demonstrate , or measure			0
@entity157 's reason for turning to @entity109 was her reputation as someone who plays aggressively but with precision , and who has a sense of style -- exactly the kinds of attributes it hoped to emphasize in marketing its line of @entity169 cameras			0
this is probably where the partnership between @entity4 and @entity6 went south			2
judging by its advertising campaign over the years , the global consulting firm relied on @entity6 to emphasize attributes such as its strategic focus and discipline ( " strategy 80 %			1
@entity178 20 % " ) ; the payoffs of its risk - taking behavior ( " @entity179			0
be a @entity6 " ) ; and its ability to recover from setbacks ( " it 's @entity184 " ) -- precisely the kind of values that may be difficult to communicate under the current circumstances			1
so it is understandable that the firm decided to cut ties with @entity6 in order to limit a negative impact on its reputation			1
however , now that the company has responded , we should not lose sight of the bigger picture : any short - term negative effects are very unlikely to outweigh the strong benefits the company experienced during its six - year relationship with the golfer			0
marketers who rely on athlete endorsers know they can be in for a rocky road -- their allied partners can suffer from injuries , a loss of form , scandals , rumors , and a range of other woes -- and they need to adapt accordingly			0
but do n't expect firms to cut back on the strategy altogether , as endorsers on the whole generate considerable value			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity220 .			2
