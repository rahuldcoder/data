@entity0 -- the @entity3 government increased its harassment of religious minorities before the @entity6 , according to a @entity8 report released friday			1
a @entity10 monk in southwest @entity3 's @entity12 province			1
the @entity8 's @entity13 on @entity14 singled out @entity3 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 to " blacklist " because they are " countries of particular concern " when it comes to religious oppression			1
over the past year , " repression of religious freedom intensified in some areas " in @entity3 , including in the @entity31 region and in @entity33 province , where the @entity34 live			1
as the @entity39 approached , some unregistered @entity37 religious groups in @entity38 reported intensified harassment from government authorities and said the government cracked down on home churches , the report says			0
the @entity8 found that over the past year , @entity3 officials also detained and interrogated several foreigners about their religious activities , alleged that the foreigners had engaged in " illegal religious activities " and canceled their visas			1
the government also undertook a " patriotic education campaign , " which required monks and nuns to sign statements personally denouncing the @entity55			0
as a result , the reports says , protests led to violence in @entity60 , @entity61 , in march , and the government detained an unknown number of monks and nuns or expelled them from monasteries			2
in addition to its continued crackdown on groups such as the @entity70 , which @entity3 considers a " cult , " the government harassed @entity73 muslims and confiscated some of their passports to prevent their taking part in the hajj , the pilgrimage to @entity20			1
once again , the @entity79 criticized the government of @entity15 , saying its " repressive , authoritarian military regime " had " imposed restrictions on certain religious activities and frequently committed abuses of the right to freedom of religion			1
" most followers of registered religions were permitted to worship as they chose , but the government infiltrated and monitored activities of virtually all organizations , including religious ones			0
the report says that although the @entity16 constitution provides for religious freedom , " genuine religious freedom does not exist , and there was no change in the extremely poor level of respect for religious freedom " over the past year			1
in @entity17 , the report says , " continued deterioration of the poor status of respect for religious freedom " last year			1
" government actions and rhetoric created a threatening atmosphere for nearly all @entity109 religious groups , most notably for @entity110 , as well as @entity111 , evangelical christians , and members of the @entity115 community , " the report says			0
" government - controlled media intensified negative campaigns against religious minorities , particularly the @entity110			0
reports of imprisonment , harassment , intimidation , and discrimination based on religious beliefs continued			0
" the @entity8 found some progress in @entity20			1
" while overall government policies continue to place severe restrictions on religious freedom , there were incremental improvements in specific areas , " the report says			0
however , the report goes on to note that " non-muslims and @entity34 who do not adhere to the government 's interpretation of @entity136 continued to face significant political , economic , legal , social , and religious discrimination			2
" it also criticizes @entity79 allies in @entity140 and @entity141 for aggressiveness toward religious minorities			0
the governments of @entity145 and @entity146 were praised for endorsing religious freedom , but the @entity8 found that the war - torn countries have problems			2
in @entity146 , " the residual effects of years of @entity153 rule , popular suspicion regarding outside influence of foreigners , and weak democratic institutions hinder the respect for religious freedom			2
" in @entity145 , " violence conducted by terrorists , extremists , and criminal gangs restricted the free exercise of religion and posed a significant threat to the country 's vulnerable religious minorities			2
" in releasing the report , secretary of state @entity168 said the @entity79 is " concerned by efforts to promote a so - called defamation of religions concept , " which has been the focus of numerous resolutions passed at the @entity174			0
she was referring to the @entity175 , a grouping of 57 @entity177 states that does not recognize the right of individuals to freely change their religion and has prevented consensus on resolutions at the @entity174 that would prohibit defamation of all religions , not just @entity136			2
" despite a pretense of protecting religious practice and promoting tolerance , the flawed concept attempts to limit freedom of religion and restrict the rights of all individuals to disagree with or criticize religion , in particular @entity136 , " the report says			0
" instead of protecting religion practice and promoting tolerance , this concept seeks to limit freedom of speech , and that could undermine the standards of international religious freedom , " @entity194 said .			0
