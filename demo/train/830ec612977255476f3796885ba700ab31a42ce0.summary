she defied her attackers and fought for justice			2
more than a decade on , she is still fighting for women 's rights in @entity5 and inspiring many around the world			1
@entity1 's " honor revenge " was carried out on the orders of a jirga -- a tribal assembly -- because her 12 - year - old brother was wrongly accused , according to a subsequent investigation ordered by the @entity18 governor , of improper relations with a woman from another tribe			1
" they decided i should be punished against my brother 's crime , " @entity1 , now 39 , told @entity23 through an interpreter			1
" they immediately acted upon that decision and dragged me out			2
that was the hardest moment of my life			0
" read : the wisdom of women -- whose words inspire you ? while the majority of rapes go unreported in @entity5 , according to @entity5 national newspaper @entity38 , @entity1 was determined not to stay silent			1
" i was of the view that i must fight back to get my rights , " said @entity1			1
" first of all , there was the rape , and afterwards when i tried to call the police , i received death threats that i would be killed if i went to a police station			0
" i sat inside the four walls of my home , but i was encouraged by well - wishers			0
my local community gave me the courage to fight back and go to the court			0
" " i decided that what happened to me should never happen to anyone else			0
" initially , six men were sentenced to death for the rape or abetting the rape			0
however , in 2011 , @entity5 's @entity58 overturned all but one of the convictions and the men were freed			2
@entity1 grew up in a small village in the @entity63 of @entity5 , where she never went to school and was forced into marriage at the age 13			1
after only a few years , she was divorced and living back home with her parents			0
" i came back to my parents ' home and i started to make myself independent			0
i started working at home doing sewing and household work , low income work			0
" i did that for 10 or 12 years and generated enough money to buy my own cattle			0
" at the age of 28 , her life changed forever when she was gang raped as a result of her younger brother 's alleged crime			1
also on leading women : the woman powering @entity90 's nuclear hopes @entity91 far from destroying her , as her attackers would have expected , the incident made @entity1 determined to fight for women 's rights and she set up the @entity1 women 's organization			1
convinced that lack of education contributed to the poor treatment of women , @entity1 established a girls ' school , initially in a single room of her family home with a just one teacher and three students , including herself			1
" the first school i attended was my own school , " said @entity1			2
for the first three years , she ran the school without any outside funding			0
" whatever i earned i used to pay the salary of the teacher			0
sometimes i had to sell my own things , " she said			0
@entity1 's school gained worldwide attention following a spate of articles in the international press in 2005 and donations began to pour in -- as well as some government money			1
today the @entity122 's @entity121 offers free education , books and uniforms to 550 girls from nursery to the beginning of high school			2
however @entity1 said the school has received no government funding for the last three years and is struggling for income			2
in addition , she has set up a women 's shelter and resource center for victims of violence , while her memoir , " @entity141 " , was published in 2006 and has been translated into 23 languages			1
in 2009 , @entity1 married a police officer who acted as her bodyguard and they now have a one - year - old son			2
late last year , the shooting of the young @entity5 activist @entity147 brought women 's rights back to worldwide attention			1
@entity147 , now 15 , was shot by the @entity149 for campaigning for girls ' education in @entity152 in october and is now recovering in hospital in the @entity154			0
" i am praying for @entity147 's health and recovery , " said @entity1			1
" she is a very little girl and the work she was doing and intends to do is great			0
" more girls are now getting an education in her region due to @entity147			0
" in the decade since her attack , @entity1 believes she has made a difference to women 's rights in @entity5 , but still has a long way to go			1
" things have improved , but not as much as they should have done			0
there are laws , but the laws are not always implemented			0
" it 's an evolutionary process and it will take time			2
i hope i have given the courage to girls and women to speak about women 's rights and to open new horizons			1
