@entity0 -- the @entity3 media went into one of its periodic feeding frenzies this week over reports that @entity3 prime minister @entity8 's oldest son @entity7 has a @entity10 girlfriend			1
gentile media around the world gleefully reported the faux hand - wringing in @entity3			1
in a world in which hundreds of thousands , if not millions , of @entity13 are in some level of " romantic involvement , " with non-jews , @entity20 's love life is , by any rational standard , a non-story			1
in @entity25 today , more than four out of five marriages involving @entity24 @entity13 are intermarriages , according to a survey by @entity28			1
so why would anyone profess to be distressed by @entity20 's alleged romantic interests ? ( the @entity8 's bureau , incidentally , issued a statement that @entity7 and the @entity34 woman identified as his girlfriend are nothing more than study partners at the @entity38			1
) the @entity13 are a small and ancient people			1
their continued existence , despite the rise of those determined to destroy them in every generation , is history 's most prolonged miracle			0
even today , @entity3 is the only country in the developed world not on the path of demographic suicide , in which elderly retirees will nearly equal younger workers in the foreseeable future			2
for believing @entity13 , @entity13 survival reflects @entity55 's choice of the @entity13 people to be the primary vehicle through which he reveals himself to the world			2
@entity13 have held fast to that relationship for more than three millennia			2
across the globe and in every historical period , great scholars and simple peasants have willingly given their lives rather than give up their relationship with @entity55			0
when a @entity13 male marries a non-jew , that unbroken , millennial chain of ancestors is severed for good			2
his children are not considered @entity13 in @entity13 law			1
and if a @entity13 woman marries a @entity10 man , it is virtually guaranteed statistically that her offspring will cease to be @entity13 within one or two generations			1
in @entity25 , three - quarters of children of intermarriage marry @entity10			1
in @entity25 , three - quarters of children of intermarriage marry @entity10			1
only 14 % of intermarried homes describe their religious orientation has primarily @entity13 , according to the sociologist @entity83 during the mid- 1990s , and 60 % of those have @entity86 trees			2
bluntly , the @entity24 segments of the @entity13 people outside of @entity3 will cease to exist in one or two generations through intermarriage			1
the end of so many family lines extending back to antiquity provokes sadness			0
yet intermarriage is the consequence rather than the cause of a more fundamental change			0
most modern @entity13 have lost connection with the distinctive beliefs and practices that have always characterized the @entity13 people , in particular the belief that the @entity13 people were chosen for a unique historical mission			1
without the belief in a particular purpose for the @entity13 people , it makes perfect sense to look for marriage partners from among those with shared political views or tastes in movies			2
the real tragedy is that " @entity13 " constitutes such a small part of the self - identity of most @entity13 today			2
what @entity117 mourn when their assimilated brethren intermarry is the finality of a step that cuts off them and their offspring of from the possibility of rediscovering what it means to be a jew			0
size is not a @entity13 standard of measure			2
the @entity130 itself promises that we will be the smallest of the nations			0
but the loss of any jew is nevertheless a tragedy			0
for at @entity137 , the @entity13 people were not only given a collective mission			1
each soul that stood there or would descend from those who stood at @entity137 was created with the potential to reveal , within the framework of the @entity153 's commandments , some aspect of @entity55 by virtue of his or her unique combination of talents and challenges to be overcome and particular familial and historical situation			0
the loss of that potential is a diminution of the entire @entity13 people			0
many non-jews , and increasingly many @entity13 as well , find @entity160 's stress on endogamy to be racist			0
membership in the @entity13 people is open to any human being who is willing to take on the same commitment as those who stood at @entity137			0
@entity160 does not sanctify gene pools but rather commitment to a mission			0
one need not be @entity13 to serve @entity55			0
@entity160 is unique among major monotheistic religions in not viewing eternal reward as contingent on becoming @entity13			1
yet @entity13 have always believed that they were chosen for a unique mission			1
for those in whom that sense of historical mission still burns the case for endogamy is a matter not just of @entity13 law but logic			1
a sense of mission -- especially one that has always entailed a high price , along with its rewards -- can only be transmitted consistently from generation to generation by two parents who share a common vision			0
the decision to marry only another @entity13 is one to make shared spiritual goals paramount in one 's marriage			0
do n't all religions advocate the same , according to their specific beliefs ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			0
