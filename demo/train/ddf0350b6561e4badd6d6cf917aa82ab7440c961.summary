with combat operations in @entity2 ending this year , president @entity0 announced he plans for almost 10,000 @entity4 troops to remain in the country in 2015 if the @entity2 government signs a security agreement			1
" we will bring @entity4 's longest war to a responsible end , " @entity0 said in the @entity8 in detailing the strategy to have virtually all @entity4 forces out of @entity2 by the end of 2016 -- shortly before his presidency ends			1
the announcement offered something to proponents and opponents of a continued @entity4 military engagement there after more than 12 years of war -- the longest in @entity4 history			0
@entity0 called for 9,800 @entity4 troops to stay in @entity2 after the end of 2014 , along with some allied forces			1
the number would get cut roughly in half by the end of 2015 , and a year later -- less than a month before @entity0 leaves the @entity29 -- the @entity4 military presence would scale down to what officials described as a " normal " embassy security contingent			1
a senior administration official told @entity35 that after 2016 , the number of @entity4 service members in @entity2 providing embassy security and engaging in cooperative security efforts with the host government and military would likely number about 1,000			1
currently , the @entity4 has 32,000 troops there			2
maintaining any forces beyond the end of 2014 -- when @entity44 and its @entity46 allies will formally halt combat operations -- depends on @entity2 signing the security agreement rejected by outgoing president @entity49 , @entity0 said tuesday			1
two candidates facing each other in next month 's run - off election to choose @entity49 's successor have indicated they will sign the security pact , @entity0 said			0
" it 's time to turn the page on more than a decade in which so much of our foreign policy was focused on the wars in @entity2 and @entity61 , " he declared			0
three conservative @entity62 who generally oppose any reduction in the @entity4 military 's global posture criticized @entity0 's announcement as " a monumental mistake and a triumph of politics over strategy			1
" " the president came into office wanting to end the wars he inherited			0
but wars do not end just because politicians say so , " said a statement by sens. @entity77 of @entity78 , @entity79 of @entity80 and @entity81 of @entity82			0
@entity0 , however , said @entity4 have learned it was harder to end a war than to start one , adding that " we have to recognize @entity2 will not be a perfect place , and it is not @entity4 's responsibility to make it one			1
" the role of @entity4 troops in @entity2 after this year will be aimed at " disrupting threats caused by @entity90 , supporting @entity2 security forces and giving the @entity2 people the opportunity to succeed as they stand on their own , " he said			1
@entity94 , @entity0 's deputy national security adviser , told @entity35 that the @entity4 will spend about $ 20 billion on the continued military presence in @entity2 after 2014			1
asked if such a cost was worth it , @entity94 replied : " we want to complete the job that we started			0
" at the same time , he said " we ca n't be in an endless war posture			0
" in a call with journalists before @entity0 's announcement , senior administration officials said the intention was to show continued international support for @entity2 as it transitions to its new elected government			2
the successful first round of voting showed @entity2 forces now were capable of providing security , the officials said			2
the @entity4 had as many as 100,000 forces in @entity2 at one point			2
in all , more than 2,300 @entity4 troops have been killed in that war , launched in the weeks after the september 11 , 2001 , @entity90 terror attacks on the @entity4			0
@entity0 's announcement came the day before he delivers a foreign policy speech at the @entity119 at @entity120 , @entity121			0
on tuesday , he indicated the shift in resources permitted by ending the wars in @entity61 and @entity2 would allow increase counter-terrorism assets in @entity126 and elsewhere			0
until now , @entity0 's administration has been reluctant to assign a number to @entity4 troop strength in @entity2 once the combat mission ends			1
@entity29 @entity62 leaders reacted to @entity0 's announcement with encouragement for a continuing mission , but skepticism over the rigid time line			1
" i 'm pleased the @entity29 met the military 's request for forces in @entity2			2
however , holding this mission to an arbitrary egg - timer does n't make a lick of sense strategically , " said rep. @entity140 , the @entity141 @entity62 who chairs the @entity143			0
house speaker @entity147 , who has pushed for reaching a bilateral security agreement with @entity2 to keep @entity4 troops there , said he welcomed the plans for a continuing mission			2
" it has been my long - standing position that input from our commanders about the conditions on the ground should dictate troop decisions , and not an arbitrary number from @entity44 , " @entity147 added in a statement			0
@entity147 : do n't repeat @entity61 mistakes in @entity2			0
