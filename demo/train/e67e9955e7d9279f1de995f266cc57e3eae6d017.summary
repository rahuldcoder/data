-- with a budget of $ 1.6 billion a year , a global staff of 14,000 and operations in 120 countries , @entity1 could be in charge of a multinational corporation			1
in fact , she is head of the charity , @entity10			1
as the first global chief executive of the world 's largest kids ' not - for - profit , she leads the organization with the business acumen and astute professionalism of a @entity19 company			1
founded at the beginning of the 19th - century by two sisters devoted to protecting children , its mission is to respond to humanitarian crises from @entity26 to @entity27			2
but in the long term , the organization 's remit is centered around improving the way children are treated across the world			1
" we want to play a role as a catalyst to really challenge some of these fundamental wrongs that ca n't be allowed to continue into the 21st century , " says @entity1			1
and with @entity1 at the helm , the charity is doing just that			1
in 2011 , @entity10 increased funding and expenditure by 10 % and helped 125 million children			1
" children should n't be going to bed hungry , they should n't be missing out on a basic education , these things are not expensive , they are not hard to solve			2
" there 's no room for vague ideas of " wanting to do good " in a charity like @entity10			1
" we are just trying to help here , " she says			0
" i have heard that refrain from too many organizations and too many quarters where that help is actually doing harm so , i 'm under no illusion that just the will to do something good ( is ) enough			0
" we 've got to be incredibly professional , we 've got to be very impartial in our work and not be drawn on one side or the other			0
" you ca n't just expect to be praised for doing good , you 've got to be running a professional organization			2
" alongside her visits to crisis - hit countries , she has met with business leaders at the @entity70 ( @entity70 ) in @entity71			2
" i do think it 's a business where our bottom line is children 's lives , " says @entity1 , 49			1
" we have to be the most efficient we can possibly be , we ca n't afford to be sloppy and just trying to do the right thing			0
" to engage with business leaders in @entity71 , @entity1 needs to emphasize the economic case for the charity 's work			1
" if i went around talking about children , i do n't think that i would get very far , " she says			2
" but if i talk about young people , democratic dividend or the fact that many of these countries are now emerging markets with increasingly young potential workforces , business people can relate to that			2
it all depends on how you pitch it			0
" @entity70 is not only an opportunity to make the business case for the welfare of children , but it 's also an ideal forum to strike up relations with companies keen to give back and be a part of the solution			1
this includes accepting pro-bono work from the likes of @entity106 to forming corporate partnerships with @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112			0
@entity10 has been criticized in recent years , accused by some of being inefficient after @entity115 's 2010 earthquake			1
" if there is genuine criticism then we look at ourselves and say ' ok , how could we be better coordinated ? how could we be more efficient ? ' " however , she added : " @entity115 was such a difficult place to be working with in the first place			0
children were n't going to school , children were going to bed hungry before the earthquake			0
we did n't do a good job of managing the very high expectations that were n't going to be met			0
watch : a crusader for children worldwide " we have got enrollment in school up to rates that were never the case before the earthquake , so i also think that sometimes the criticism can be unfair			0
" @entity1 grew up on the outskirts of @entity137 and -- apart from a spell volunteering in @entity139 in her 20s -- she worked in business until the age of 36			2
in 1999 , she left her job with @entity144 and moved her young family to @entity146 in @entity147 to become regional director for @entity149			0
after six years with @entity149 , she made the switch to @entity10 , first as chief executive of the @entity153 branch , and in 2010 , became the organization 's first international head			1
since taking the post , @entity1 has worked to merge much of the work of the not - for - profit 's 30 national organizations			1
it is not a job that affords much rest			0
just back from the @entity163 and @entity164 , @entity1 is about to leave for @entity165			2
" i try and keep the trips quite short because i do want to get home and spend some time with the family , " she says			0
" one of the great things about the work that i 'm doing now is it 's appropriate to bring one of my kids along sometimes			0
so my daughter came with me to @entity176 , my son to @entity178 , they 've seen quite a bit of the world			0

@entity1 is the first international chief executive of @entity10

our bottom line is children 's lives , says @entity1
