@entity0 , @entity1 -- while the world focuses on the gruesome images of a dead @entity5 in @entity6 , many are missing another big game - changer taking place sunday in the @entity10 world -- through ballots , not bullets			1
it 's happening in @entity1 , which is once again making history			1
with popular protest , @entity1 pushed its dictator @entity16 @entity16 from power on january 14			1
on sunday , it will hold elections for the constitutional assembly that will determine the nation 's future ; it will be the first time many @entity1 have gone to the polls			1
this is a historic moment for @entity1 , and for the world			1
but there are no colorful banners or the festival atmosphere that often proclaims election seasons			2
instead , @entity1 streets are quiet			1
campaign posters are confined to designated spots on carefully marked walls			2
walking around @entity0 , one occasionally stumbles upon the checkerboard series of posters , usually with nearly identical slogans			0
otherwise , it 's business as usual			0
in part , this is because laws restrict campaign activities to indoor spaces with prior approval			1
these laws may be intended to level the playing field , but have the effect of muting debate			0
beyond this , most would - be voters find the elections confusing			0
more than 100 parties , 1,500 party lists ( which offer proportional representation ) and 10,000 candidates are vying for 199 seats in @entity1 's 27 in - country districts			1
( @entity1 has established another six districts to represent @entity1 living outside the country			1
) this is combined with decades of authoritarian rule that has left many @entity1 cynical , uninformed and detached from politics			1
only 4.4 million of an estimated 7.5 million to 8 million eligible voters are registered to vote , despite an extended registration period			0
for some , though , stakes seem incredibly high			0
some tunisians worry that " old forces " under @entity16 's regime will find a foothold in the new order			1
@entity1 authorities banned those who held positions of responsibility in the old ruling party from running in elections			1
the ban technically excluded thousands and clipped the wings of the old regime , but few believe their influence has disappeared for good			0
perhaps more palpable is the concern that @entity85 will hijack the process			1
some point to @entity89 demonstrations against the airing of the animated film " @entity92 " on the private @entity1 tv station @entity94 as a clear sign that @entity89 forces are strong and determined to undo @entity1 's secular regime			1
islamists opposed to the depiction of @entity100 in the animated , award - winning @entity102 film about the 1979 @entity104 revolution marched in central @entity0 , until riot police used tear gas to disperse them			0
in defense of freedom and rights , secularists mounted a counter-demonstration , marching with tape over their mouths to protest limitations of freedom			0
there is finger - pointing on both sides			0
those who fear the @entity89 party , @entity119 -- by far the strongest , best organized in the country -- point to the demonstrations as evidence that @entity119 ca n't be trusted , or at best will be forced by @entity123 to take more radical policies			0
those favoring @entity119 tell a story of incitement and conspiracy , in which @entity129 intentionally incited the conflict to undermine @entity85			2
more generally , they fervently pledge to respect women 's rights , with loudspeaker announcements reminding voters that women make up an important half of society			2
on the bright side , debate is clearly alive and well in @entity1			2
it is found around dinner tables , in conference rooms , schools and universities			0
moreover , @entity1 seem determined to succeed			2
there is a sense of self - restraint and compromise among many , underpinned by formal agreements , that they must keep the process on track			0
it is incredibly important that the electoral process succeed , not just for @entity1 , but for the world			2
just like the demonstrations that led to @entity16 's downfall , the elections receive little attention			0
yet , just as the demonstrations ultimately changed the face of the @entity10 world , the elections can alter the course of history			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity168 .			2

@entity168 : historic election sunday will determine @entity1 's future , but there is little *fanfare*
she says this is because laws restrict campaign activities and huge ballots are confusing
she says years of *repression* have left @entity1 cynical , uninformed , *apathetic*
lust : worry that @entity85 will dominate or that old regime will *intrude* make vote crucial
