almost three years has elapsed since the ousting of the dictator @entity1 from @entity2 , which triggered the commonly -- and wrongly -- labeled @entity3			1
at that time @entity2 , full of high hopes and incited by the degradation of their living conditions , took to the streets and demonstrated peacefully for real change in their country			1
for us , it was n't an @entity3 but a @entity13			0
@entity2 ' demands were summarized in the most chanted slogan of that time : " employment , freedom and dignity			1
" but how have things changed since then ? are there real efforts to bring democracy ? are we really experiencing a democratic transition ? after the departure of @entity27 @entity1 , the few months of revolutionary euphoria , and the succession of two transitional governments , we finally had , on october the 23 , 2011 , what was expected to be the first fair and transparent elections of a @entity33			0
the elections were meant to choose representatives with a duty to draft a new @entity37 within a year			0
the @entity38 , the @entity39 , won about 40 % of the seats in the @entity33			0
two political parties joined the once outlawed @entity43 group and formed the ruling @entity44			0
more than two years later , @entity2 does not have its new @entity37			1
the majority of @entity2 seem unhappy with the performance of the ruling parties			1
and while @entity2 has avoided the bloodshed afflicting much of the @entity50 region , plans to revitalize the country have stalled			1
let 's be methodical and go back to the slogan of the dignity revolution : " employment , freedom and national dignity			1
" economic misery , social frustration and political yearning were the main elements that led to the eruption of revolts			2
the economic despair was central to the revolution , but today @entity2 is failing to deliver the jobs and opportunities people have been longing for			1
no one can deny that the economic situation in @entity2 is catastrophic			1
unemployment is on rise and the number of job opportunities are in decline			0
insecurity is a major reason for this			0
the atmosphere of uncertainty created by the ongoing arguments between the ruling islamists and the secular opposition over the formation of a caretaker cabinet is tormenting investors , tourists and international lenders			0
the assassination of two opposition leaders , explosion of several mines , killings of several soldiers and policemen in @entity96 and suicide attack at a beach resort has made the situation worse			2
the confusion is destabilizing the country , and has had a huge impact on the economy			0
when we speak of freedom , human rights and dignity , the situation is no better			1
individual freedoms and human rights are frequently violated			1
@entity110 , the first @entity2 imprisoned for his opinion after @entity1 was ousted , would be the best example			1
@entity110 received a seven and a half year jail sentence for expressing his views on @entity115			1
his case is not unique ; several journalists , bloggers , artists have been arrested and intimidated for their opinions			0
leaks about mistreatments , torture and sometimes death under torture are not rare			0
human right defenders point to several cases of suspected deaths under torture			2
in today 's @entity2 you can be hassled , harassed , assaulted and even threatened of death if you dare to express your opinion as to the progressive @entity133 of the country			1
if you are a woman you can face all this just for wearing " inappropriate " clothes or for going out at night			0
violent police attacks on peaceful demonstrations have been recorded many times , like was the case on april 9 , 2012 , when many people were beaten and severely injured for celebrating the memory of the martyrs			0
as an activist i have certainly experienced intimidation under the regime of @entity1			0
but i have never received death threats and i did n't have to be under the close protection of the police as it is the case today			0
all i am doing is expressing myself as i used to do			2
i am trying to comment on the situation as i see it and i am attempting to give voice to those who do n't have one , so i can expose their problems and sufferings			2
so can we continue to talk about dignity when people are jobless and human rights are violated ? can we talk about dignity when our mouths are muzzled ? after months of wrangling over @entity2 's future following the assassinations , within six months , of @entity169 and @entity170 -- the country 's two dissident leaders -- political parties in @entity2 finally chose the country 's new leader			1
@entity173 is now acting prime minister of the country , and is due to be officially appointed in january			0
he has been tasked with leading the country out of its political impasse			0
but will this drive the country out of the crisis ? i feel our revolution has been confiscated and our dreams stolen			2
despite this i remain hopeful for my country			2
tunisians , especially the young , civil society and women are resisting attempts to steal the @entity13 dreams and derail it from its real objectives and goals there have been several attempts to attack both human rights and women 's rights as the @entity37 has been drafted			1
but this has been noticed by civil society watchdogs , who will act when they need to			0
attempts to exclude young people from taking decisions and to muzzle the mouths of @entity2 are resisted			2
we are all acting to build the @entity2 we dreamed of			2

@entity2 triggered the revolution across the @entity210 when a fruit - seller set fire to himself
three years on , the economic situation is dire and human rights continue to be violated
blogger @entity240 says she is harassed for expressing her views on that situation
but she remains hopeful as @entity2 continue to fight for their dream of freedom
