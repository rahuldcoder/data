-- " eaten alive " ? not quite			1
herpetologist @entity1 generated lots of hype ahead of his attempt during a @entity5 special to be eaten whole by a giant green anaconda , the largest and most powerful snake in the world			1
to many viewers ' disappointment , @entity1 was constricted by the snake but never consumed			1
" ultimately , after the snake constricted @entity1 for over an hour and went for his head , the experiment had to be called when it became clear that @entity1 would be very seriously injured if he continued on			1
the safety of @entity1 , as well as the anaconda , was always our number one priority , " @entity16 said in a statement			1
viewers ultimately recoiled at the special after it aired sunday and took to social media to blast the network for overselling the program 's title			2
no way that snake could have eaten someone his size			2
i was just hoping it could squeeze him to death at least but no such luck			0
sorry to say i cheered for the snake , but frankly it had 10x more charisma than those lame excuses for humans had , " said one @entity0 commenter			2
@entity1 presented himself as prey to the snake after putting on a special reinforced suit with helmet and devices to measure his vital signs , he said before the show aired in a news release on the @entity5 website			1
before the special , @entity1 claimed that he spent an hour inside the snake , which was difficult because he 's claustrophobic			1
" she got me right in the face , " @entity1 said			2
" the last thing i saw was her mouth wide open before everything went black			1
as this happened , she wrapped around me and took me off of my feet			0
i felt the suit cracking			0
it felt as if my arms were ripping out of their sockets			0
" @entity1 did n't say much more about his experience in the western @entity67 , which was filmed in advance , because he wanted everybody to tune in			2
some @entity0 commenters were left hungry for more substance after watching			0
" the last 30 minutes of the program shows him wrestling with the snake then trying to get but never getting eaten -- all of this is punctuated by overproduction ( i.e. , loud music , short scenes and shots cut together like an action movie , etc. ) to add drama where there really is none			2
when all is said and done , i 've been swallowed by as many anacondas as he has , " wrote one viewer			0
the @entity5 said that it was @entity1 's " absolute intention to be eaten alive " but that his and the snake 's well - being were of the utmost importance			1
some animal rights organizations complained , but @entity1 says the snake came out fine			1
" i would not have done this if there were any real chance of hurting or stressing out the snake , " he said			0
next , he wants to find the biggest anaconda			0
" during an earlier expedition in the @entity67 , we encountered a 26 - foot - long anaconda that weighed hundreds of pounds , " he said			0
" the snake for the ' @entity104 ' project was big , about 18 feet long , but we know that there are even larger anacondas out there			0
" @entity0 's @entity108 contributed to this report .			0
