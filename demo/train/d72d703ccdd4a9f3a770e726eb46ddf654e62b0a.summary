@entity0 -- question : how many years since the @entity3 have both @entity5 senators from @entity7 been @entity6 ? sen. @entity9 's breed of fiscally conservative , socially progressive lawmakers is on decline in @entity12			1
the state sent democrats @entity15 and @entity17 to the @entity18 between 1945 and 1947			0
if you knew that , you understand just how far the @entity20 has fallen in its ancestral homeland of the @entity12 , a decline that was underscored by sen. @entity9 's recent decision to leave the party			1
@entity9 's decision to join @entity7 sen. @entity26 on the @entity6 side of the aisle raises a host of questions about a party that , after years in power , suddenly finds itself hemorrhaging voters and ceding vast swaths of electoral terrain			1
first and foremost , who killed the @entity37 ? what happened to @entity9 's breed of fiscally conservative , socially progressive , temperamentally moderate @entity41 officeholders ? and if they can be resurrected , should they ? @entity44 to moderate @entity45 once were as much a part of the political landscape as today 's liberals from @entity49			1
now , they live mostly in the history books			0
@entity52 and @entity53 of @entity54 may be the last ones standing in today 's @entity18			2
the @entity56 sealed the deal for @entity58 in 1860			0
it broke the back of @entity62 's populist democrats in 1896			2
it kept the @entity45 in power for all but 16 years between the @entity3 and the @entity65			2
@entity9 's home state was the only large industrial state to back @entity68 over @entity69 in 1932			1
even after @entity69 started tilting the region to the @entity6 , it produced a slew of moderate @entity20 officeholders , postwar leaders like @entity72 's @entity71 and @entity73 , @entity7 's @entity74 and @entity75 , @entity54 's @entity76 and @entity77 , @entity49 ' @entity78 and @entity79 , @entity81 's @entity80 and @entity82 , @entity84 's @entity83 , @entity86 's @entity85 and @entity88 's @entity87			1
so what happened ? in short , notes @entity1 polling director @entity94 , there has been a slow but steady @entity97 backlash to the @entity20 's four - decade - old " @entity99 strategy			1
" race and religion brought @entity99 whites into the @entity20 but also began pushing out a lot of affluent @entity97 suburbanites			1
those socially moderate voters formed the core of the @entity37 constituency			2
major political realignments do n't happen overnight , however			0
a lot of disaffected @entity110 continued voting @entity6 in state and local elections for a long time , even after being wooed by @entity113 and @entity114			0
old habits die hard , and @entity99 @entity6 parties slowed their decline by continuing to nominate candidates more in step with voters in their states			1
the same story , only in reverse , held true in the @entity12			0
thirty years ago , after @entity113 but before the @entity125 , the 11 @entity41 states stretching from @entity88 to @entity54 still sent 37 republicans to the @entity127 and another 10 to the @entity18			0
today , those same states have 18 @entity37 representatives in the @entity127 and three in the @entity18			0
the numbers are more stark in @entity131 and @entity72			0
@entity131 no longer has a single @entity20 representative in the @entity127			2
the 29 - member @entity134 delegation has only three @entity37			0
and what about @entity9 's home state ? since @entity113 implemented the @entity99 strategy in 1968 , the @entity37 presidential nominee 's share of the popular vote in @entity7 has been smaller than his share of the nationwide vote in every election			1
the erosion of the @entity37 vote is clearly seen in election returns from @entity9 's political base , the moderate @entity150 suburbs			1
in 1976 , @entity151 lost @entity7 to @entity152 while carrying suburban @entity153 , @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157 counties			0
in 2008 , @entity158 lost @entity7 to @entity159 while getting crushed in those same counties			0
@entity158 lost @entity156 and @entity157 counties by more than 20 points			0
those same suburbs are now represented by only one @entity37 congressman , moderate rep. @entity164 , who has been elected in each of the past four cycles by the skin of his teeth			2
increasingly precise gerrymandering to create safer districts for incumbents has taken a bad situation for moderate @entity37 and made it worse			2
safe @entity37 districts are conservative districts , and conservative districts do n't nominate moderates			0
when @entity9 announced his defection to the @entity6 , he noted that more than 200,000 @entity7 @entity37 changed their registration to become @entity6 in 2008			2
@entity9 knows that the bulk of those switches came from the moderate suburbs			1
after barely beating conservative challenger @entity183 for the 2004 @entity20 nomination , he could read the writing on the wall for the 2010 primary			2
now that @entity9 's gone to the other side , should @entity7 @entity37 nominate a conservative in 2010 ? not if they want to have a good chance to win			1
a new @entity192 poll of @entity7 voters suggests that @entity9 would beat @entity183 , a former congressman , by 20 points in a general election contest			2
former gov. @entity196 , a social moderate in the @entity37 mold , trails @entity9 by only 3 points , a statistical dead heat			1
it 's not impossible for more conservative candidates to win statewide in the @entity12 -- former @entity7 sen. @entity204 won two terms before losing in 2006 -- but it is significantly harder and happens much less often			0
conservative candidates in step with today 's @entity99 - dominated @entity20 are out of step in the @entity12			1
they also represent a distinct ideological minority on the @entity211 , much of the @entity212 and , increasingly , the @entity213			0
of course , @entity20 strategists are right when they say the party has been left for dead before , only to spring back to life			1
@entity218 's 1964 blowout loss was followed by major @entity37 gains in the 1966 midterms and @entity113 's triumphant return in 1968			0
the party 's 1974 @entity223 debacle laid the groundwork for @entity114			0
and @entity227 's 1992 win paved the way for the @entity20 's first @entity127 majority in forty years			1
but what may make the fallout from 2008 different is the clear regional nature of the @entity20 's setback			1
the wipeout in the old @entity37 heartland has been a long time coming			0
at the same time , the @entity45 have lost some ground in the @entity99 and the @entity211 because the @entity6 have been willing to nominate candidates who differ with national party leaders on hot button social issues like gun control and abortion			1
they also have n't been afraid to throw a few fiscal conservatives into the mix. winning national coalitions are rarely unified on all of the big issues			0
the @entity20 now has to decide whether it wants to copy the @entity6 ' strategy in the @entity12 or whether it would rather circle the ideological wagons			1
the decision may dictate the shape of @entity5 politics for years to come .			0

@entity44 , moderate @entity45 once a strong part of landscape
@entity9 's decision to switch parties raises a host of questions about the @entity20
there 's been a slow *northern* backlash to @entity20 's " @entity99 strategy , " @entity94 says
@entity20 has been left for dead before , only to spring back to life
