-- february 7 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 , @entity6 @entity7 , @entity8 transcript this is a @entity11			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity15 , @entity16 : i 'm @entity18 and this is @entity0 ! we 're back from the weekend with 10 minutes of commercial - free headlines , including why you should n't believe everything you read			2
first up : @entity4 in crisis @entity25 : we 're beginning in @entity4 where there are some signs that things are slowly getting back to normal			1
in the capital city of @entity32 , some shops and banks are re-opening , and traffic is starting to look like it did before the political protests of the past couple weeks			0
but there are some changes going on in the country			0
on saturday , some key members of the ruling party resigned			0
and yesterday , vice president @entity40 met with representatives from groups that have protested against the @entity4 government			1
they talked about some ideas for how @entity4 might move forward , although some of the protesters still out in the streets said the people meeting with @entity40 do n't necessarily represent them			1
we 've been watching this political unrest in @entity4 and other parts of the @entity53			1
@entity54 joins us now to talk about the potential impact that it could have on the @entity58 military			1
( begin video ) @entity60 , @entity0 pentagon correspondent : with unrest now sweeping across @entity4 and neighboring countries , new questions about whether it 's a security crisis here at the @entity66			1
a quick look at the map tells you how deeply tied the @entity58 military is to regimes across the @entity53 and @entity72			1
in @entity4 , the @entity58 provides around $ 1.3 billion a year in military aid			1
in return , the @entity58 gets vital military air , land and sea access			1
@entity58 warships transit the @entity79 on their way to and from the @entity72			1
loss of the canal could lead to catastrophic delays and a crisis			0
in @entity90 , where president @entity86 is facing demonstrations and has already said he wo n't run for re-election , the @entity58 has been quietly training @entity90 forces to go after a rising threat from @entity93			1
the @entity58 has conducted drone and missile strikes inside @entity90			1
the question : will a new government cooperate with @entity58 counterterrorism efforts ? in @entity100 , @entity99 is facing increasing discontent due to rising prices and unemployment			1
@entity100 remains one of the @entity58 's closest allies in the @entity106			1
@entity100 's intelligence services secretly operate against key @entity93 targets			2
@entity100 has also helped train @entity110 forces , and @entity100 troops serve in @entity112			0
three key @entity72 allies provide other assistance			0
@entity115 is home of the regional headquarters of the @entity117 , which oversees the region and keeps a close eye on @entity120			0
@entity121 is a staging area for @entity58 troops moving in and out of @entity112 and @entity110			1
and @entity123 is home to the @entity124 , which patrols the @entity72 and pirate - infested waters off @entity127			0
the @entity58 spends billions of dollars in military aid and assistance across the region in return for all of this access			1
but the question may now be if the social unrest that is emerging leads to regime change , will the new regimes want to do the old business with the @entity58 military ? @entity54 , @entity0 , the @entity66			1
( @entity139 ) unemployment report @entity25 : the @entity58 unemployment rate is down ! that should be good news , but it 's not that simple			1
during january , the rate dropped from 9.4 percent to 9 percent flat			0
but some economists ' descriptions of the unemployment report ranged from positive to mysterious to disappointing			0
one thing most everyone agreed on : the weather played a big role in all of this			0
all of those snow storms we 've talked about kept people from getting out to look for work and kept a lot of companies from hiring			2
@entity161 @entity162 , @entity16 : today 's shoutout goes out to mrs. @entity165 's gifted class at @entity166 in @entity167 , @entity168 ! who won the 1980 @entity58 presidential election ? was it : a ) @entity175 , b ) @entity177 , c ) @entity173 or @entity174 ) @entity172 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! @entity175 won that election to become the 40th president of the @entity58			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity175 remembered @entity25 : @entity175 was 69 years old when he won that election			2
the oldest @entity58 elected president and during his his 8 years in office , president @entity175 had several famous firsts			1
he appointed the first female justice to the @entity58 @entity189			1
he submitted the first trillion dollar budget to @entity191			0
and he was the first @entity58 president to address both houses of the @entity194			1
yesterday would have been president @entity175 's 100th birthday			1
a ceremony for the late president yesterday included a wreath - laying at his memorial site and a 21 - gun salute			2
as @entity58 remembers @entity175 , @entity201 takes us on a tour of his presidential library in @entity5 , @entity6			1
( begin video ) former @entity58 president @entity175 : mr. @entity207 , tear down this wall			1
@entity209 , @entity0 correspondent : video and sound are a constant feature			0
@entity175 's movies and speeches are played throughout			2
@entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 : we have right over here to my right , the very famous debate with president @entity177 , where he asked the question , " are you better off now than you were four years ago ? " @entity227 : there 's also a @entity229 , with tunnels , an interactive videogame table and an inauguration day exhibit complete with @entity175 's speech on the teleprompter			1
his diaries have been digitized for people to flip through			0
there 's also an exhibit dealing with the assassination attempt on president @entity175 after 70 days in office			1
as in many presidential libraries , you can see an exact replica of the @entity244			0
and @entity245 , the actual plane used by seven @entity58 presidents and the one @entity175 flew in during his eight years in office			1
@entity249 : they get to see right where the president sits in the aircraft			2
they get to see his working quarters			0
they get to see where the @entity258 would sit , where the traveling press corps sits			0
they get to touch and feel the airplane			0
it 's just a great experience			2
@entity227 : an iran - contra affair exhibit deals with the low point of the @entity175 presidency			0
also on display , the letter @entity175 wrote , with the audio of him reading it , announcing to the world he had @entity271 's			2
@entity175 : my fellow @entity58 , i have recently been told that i am one of the millions of @entity58 who will be afflicted with @entity271 's disease			1
( @entity139 ) is this legit ? @entity275 , @entity16 : is this legit ? the first @entity276 was played in 1967			0
yep , it 's true ! that game featured a face - off between the @entity280 and @entity281			1
@entity282 @entity25 : in @entity284 yesterday , you saw it , the @entity280 and the @entity285			0
you know what happened in the game			0
we want to talk about the commercials ! whether you thought these were good or bad , all of them had something in common			0
the average cost of a 30 - second ad in this year 's @entity276 was three million dollars			2
one industry that was a big part of yesterday 's ads : car companies			2
nine of them paid to run commercials			0
some experts think that could be a good sign for the economy			0
here 's why : if the companies are willing to spend millions for @entity276 ads , it might mean they think viewers are willing to go out and buy the cars			2
and if people are willing to buy big items like that , that could mean people are feeling more confident about the economy			0
@entity319 ? @entity25 : your teacher tells you about an endangered species : the tree octopus			0
your assignment is to go learn more about the animal , and there 's a web site with all the information you need for your report			2
only problem ? the entire thing is a hoax ! that really happened			0
the @entity335 sponsored a study run by researchers at the @entity338			2
they set up this fake web site about the tree octopus filled with all kinds of facts			0
none of them true ; there is no such thing as tree octopus			0
the researchers wanted to see what kind of impact the internet can have on students ' ability to think critically			1
and not only did they accept all the facts on the web site as they were written , after the students were told it was all made up , some of them still refused to believe it was a hoax			2
@entity363 @entity25 : i 've never spoken to a student who says he believes everything he 's read on the internet			1
but this study would suggest that many students actually do ! we want you to visit our blog today and tell us : what can be done to be sure that what you see online is the truth ? @entity377 ! before we go @entity25 : two things i can do : i can run four miles , and i can eat a dozen doughnuts			1
but not at the same time ! that 's the challenge these folks took on over the weekend			2
it 's the annual @entity384			2
you run two miles , eat a dozen doughnuts , then run two miles back			0
and you have to do it all in under one hour			0
i do n't think you need an excuse to down a dozen doughnuts , but this race does raise money for charity			0
goodbye @entity25 : and that kind of thing always makes you feel good , doughnut ? if you can stomach more puns like that one , we 'll hurl some more your way tomorrow			0
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity18 .			0

though conditions in @entity4 remain fluid , some *tensions* may be easing
the @entity58 remembers its 40th president on what would 've been his 100th birthday
a study suggests many students may not think critically about what they see online
