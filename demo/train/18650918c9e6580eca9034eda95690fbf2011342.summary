-- the only criminal charge to come out of the academic fraud scandal at the @entity3 has been dropped			1
@entity5 district attorney @entity4 announced on thursday that ex-professor @entity6 would no longer be facing a felony fraud charge			1
he was accused of taking money to teach classes that did n't exist			1
@entity4 said the decision was based on @entity6 's cooperation , both with the criminal investigation , which is over , and the university - sanctioned investigation being done by former federal prosecutor @entity15			0
@entity15 was hired this year by @entity3 to do another internal investigation , since past investigations pinning the sole blame on @entity19 have not satisfied questions and curiosity from the community and from critics of @entity3 who think the scope of the fake classes was much bigger than @entity3 admits			1
the so called " paper classes " scandal involves hundreds of classes that never met and required little work , and even though many athletes were enrolled in them , @entity3 and the @entity26 have been criticized for saying the issue had nothing to do with athletics			1
that all makes the cooperation of @entity38 a game - changer in the quest to find answers , and @entity4 said last week that is the reason he had been considering dropping the charges			2
he said he felt it was better for the community to understand who else knew about the fake classes and who created them than it was for one professor to be punished criminally			1
" even though it 's a noncriminal investigation , that is more important than this , " @entity4 said , referring to @entity15 's review			0
@entity6 's cooperation also led to the @entity26 announcing it would reopen its investigation into academic fraud at @entity3			1
it previously had found no athletic scandal			0
but in the last few months , a flurry of reporting has called that into question			0
several athletes have said they were pushed into the fake classes by athletic advisers , and whistle - blower @entity67 has said that many star athletes were kept eligible by taking the classes			1
" that 's not just @entity6 , " @entity67 said			0
" it 's what we , the university , used to keep athletes eligible and that just is the truth			0
" @entity67 was a @entity3 employee who told reporters about the classes			1
she has since quit her job and filed suit against the university			0
@entity15 said @entity6 's cooperation has been very valuable			0
" he has answered all of our questions regarding the academic and athletic dimensions of the irregular courses offered in the department of @entity91 and @entity92 , and he has provided important insights and information we would otherwise not have received , " @entity15 said			0
@entity15 said last week that his team has so far collected 1.5 million e-mails and documents , talked to 30 people in the athletic - academic areas of @entity3 and is looking at athlete transcripts going back to the 1980s			2
that 's something no other @entity3 investigation had done			2
" @entity3 is the mother of all academic fraud violations , " said @entity104 , president of the @entity105 for @entity106 in @entity107			2
" ... theres no doubt in my mind about cooperation of friendly faculty and the cover - up and the excuses of this kind of behavior that has gone on in the university			0
" it 's quite likely that if it is shown that this is a long - term systematic scheme on the part of the university that @entity3 will need to vacate wins , " @entity104 said			2
@entity26 reopens paper class investigation at @entity3 whistle - blower in @entity3 paper class case files lawsuit @entity3 : we failed students ' for years '			1
