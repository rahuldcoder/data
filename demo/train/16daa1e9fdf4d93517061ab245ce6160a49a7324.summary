-- president @entity1 is celebrated and criticized for greatly accelerating the number of @entity4 drone attacks in @entity5 , but the similar covert war that he has launched in @entity7 has received considerably less attention			1
the @entity1 administration has launched an estimated 28 drone strikes and 13 air strikes in @entity7 , according to data compiled by the @entity13 from reliable news reports			1
by contrast , the administration of @entity16 only launched one drone attack in @entity7			2
( the data was gathered from media outlets that include the @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity0 and the @entity23			0
) on april 25 , the @entity24 approved a new policy inaugurating a more aggressive campaign of drone strikes in @entity7 allowing so - called " signature " strikes			1
these are strikes on individuals whose patterns of behavior signal the presumed presence of an important militant or of a plot against the @entity37 , even if the targeted individual 's identity is unknown			1
previously , the administration only allowed the @entity37 @entity41 ( @entity41 ) and the @entity4 to launch drone attacks in @entity7 against top - level militants whose names appeared on secret @entity41 and @entity4 target lists and whose locations could be confirmed			1
these broadened rules of engagement will likely result in the further acceleration of @entity37 intelligence and military operations in @entity7 , a chaotic , weak state embroiled in several overlapping civil wars			2
as of june 6 , drone strikes and airstrikes had killed an estimated 531 to 779 people in @entity7 , 509 to 713 of whom were identified in media reports as militants , according to the @entity13 's data			1
of these deaths , 99 % occurred during @entity1 's presidency			0
the civilian casualty rate from these strikes is estimated to be between 4 % and 8.5 % , roughly comparable with the civilian casualty rate from the @entity37 drone program in @entity5 , which averaged 5.5 % in 2011 , according to @entity13 data			1
the @entity4 inaugurated the lethal drone program in @entity7 on november 3 , 2002 , with a hellfire missile launched from a predator drone at a vehicle in the province of @entity71 , about 100 miles east of the capital city of @entity73			2
the attack killed @entity76 's top operative in @entity7 , @entity77 , who was also a suspect in the 2000 bombing of the @entity79 off the @entity7 coast			2
with @entity77 in that car were five other militants , all of whom were killed , including @entity37 citizen @entity85			2
his was the first reported @entity37 death to result from the @entity4 's drone campaign			1
after the 2002 @entity37 drone strike , there was no reported @entity37 airstrikes or drone attacks in @entity7 until december 2009 , when a sustained campaign of attacks began			1
that change came about because @entity76 's @entity7 - based affiliate , @entity95 ( @entity95 ) , has over the past three years attempted a number of terrorist attacks against the @entity37 , launching it from relative obscurity to the top of the @entity37 government 's list of national security threats			1
in a statement posted on jihadist websites in december 28 , 2009 , @entity95 claimed responsibility for the attempted " underwear bomb " attack on a @entity108 - bound passenger airliner three days earlier			0
and in november 2010 , the group claimed responsibility for a plot to send two packages containing bombs hidden in printer cartridges to two @entity117 synagogues			0
the packages were discovered in the @entity119 and @entity120 after @entity122 officials provided a tip about the plot			0
in july 2011 , secretary of defense @entity124 said the @entity37 was " within reach of strategically defeating @entity76 , " and that he believed of all @entity76 affiliates , @entity95 posed the greatest threat to the @entity37 homeland			2
@entity76 in @entity7 advertises for @entity130 recruits counting drone attacks and airstrikes in @entity7 is complicated because it has often been unclear whether attacks were launched from drones or from fighter jets , and villagers regularly provide conflicting accounts of the kinds of aircraft used in these attacks			1
to make data collection on these strikes even more difficult , diplomatic cables released by the transparency watchdog site @entity143 revealed that the @entity7 government has sometimes taken credit for airstrikes that were in fact being carried out by the @entity37			1
according to one cable , then - @entity7 president @entity149 told then - gen. @entity151 in january 2010 , " we 'll continue saying the bombs are ours , not yours , " after which deputy prime minister @entity154 joked that he had just " lied " to the @entity7 @entity156 about the @entity37 role in such strikes			1
during the @entity1 administration , @entity37 drones have killed at least 16 key @entity76 militants in @entity7 , including the @entity7 - @entity37 cleric @entity162 on september 30 , 2011 , and @entity163 who was suspected of involvement in the 2000 bombing of the @entity79			1
while the covert drone war is claiming a fast - rising toll , it 's not clear it is significantly weakening @entity95			2
@entity169 , a leading expert on @entity7 at @entity170 , points out that @entity76 's @entity7 affiliate has grown in size during the past three years from around 200 to 300 militants to more than 1,000 fighters and " controls significant portions of territory in southern @entity7			2
in parts of @entity180 and @entity181 provinces , the organization controls towns in which it has established its own police departments and court systems			0
it is providing water , electricity and services to these towns			0
in short , @entity95 now sees itself as the de facto government in the areas under its control			0
" since the longtime @entity7 strongman @entity149 stepped down in february , the @entity37 drone strikes and airstrikes have increased			1
in just three months , the @entity37 launched an estimated 20 strikes			0
by comparison , there were just 18 attacks in the previous two years			0
@entity169 asks : " what happens if this ' missile surge ' does n't work ? what happens next ? does the @entity37 fire more and more missiles in the hopes that it will reach a tipping point ? " given the @entity1 administration 's embrace of drone strikes , the answer to that question seems likely to be : yes			1
