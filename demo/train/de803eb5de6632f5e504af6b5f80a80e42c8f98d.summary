-- @entity2 's plans to fly a fifth and final space shuttle mission to service the @entity4 have suffered another set - back			1
@entity6 was prepared to launch in september before an onboard computer failed , delaying the mission			2
@entity4 managers say ground testing of a critical replacement computer that they hope to install on the orbiting telescope is taking longer than previously expected			1
and that means an additional flight delay			0
" delivery in april to support a may launch , i think is a fair thing to say , " said @entity4 program manager @entity15			1
" right now i think we have a very good chance of meeting a readiness date in that time frame			0
" the additional delay is just the latest dip in an emotional rollercoaster ride for the @entity4 team over the past few months			1
in late september , astronauts were mere weeks away from launching to @entity4 aboard the space shuttle @entity6 , with spacewalks planned to make the telescope more powerful than ever and extend its expected lifespan an additional five years			1
that flight had to be postponed when the onboard computer that downlinks scientific data to the ground suddenly failed on september 27th			2
while that problem has been corrected using a back - up system , @entity2 managers have decided the computer needs to be completely replaced in order to keep a fully redundant back - up capability available			1
a spare computer was built prior to @entity4 's launch in 1990 , and has been warehoused at the @entity44 in @entity45 ever since			1
initially , engineers had hoped that spare could be quickly tested , certified " flight ready , " and shipped to the @entity48 in @entity49 to be packed aboard @entity6 in time for a february launch			2
but a closer evaluation of the spare shows more than six months of work will be needed to get it ready to fly			1
among other issues , it was partially disassembled other the years so that parts could be used for other systems			0
it has been largely put back together , but now programming anomalies are cropping up			0
and once engineers get it in good working order , it will have to go a battery of environmental tests to make sure it is ready to hold up in the harsh conditions of space			2
but the engineers are confident that they will eventually overcome all the obstacles			0
" we 've gotten a lot smarter about the condition of this unit over the last four weeks , said @entity15			0
" we do n't want to take any chances in bringing a box up there that is n't going to be 100 % working to the absolute best that it can			0
so we want to take some extra time and make sure that we subject this to a very rigorous test program and we do n't want to leave any stones unturned on the way to the launch pad			0

@entity2 's plans to service @entity4 suffer another *setback*
ground testing of a critical replacement computer taking longer than expected
" delivery in april to support a may launch , " @entity2 manager *predicts*
more than six months of work will be needed to get it ready to fly
