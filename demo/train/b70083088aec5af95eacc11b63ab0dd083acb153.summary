the city of @entity1 is losing one of its most beloved institutions : its airport carpet			1
but the carpet is going out in sentimental style , with a wave of commemorative t - shirts , beer and now even a new edition of hoop shoes bearing the iconic design			1
the latest entrant : @entity18 with an addition to @entity20 ' star @entity16 's line of sneakers made to resemble the iconic floor covering			1
the shoe is the result of " a really quick - turn creation process " to jump on the ever - hottening trend , according to @entity18 @entity27 public relations director @entity26			1
@entity1 is home to the @entity31 shoe company 's @entity29 headquarters			1
" something special for my @entity34 fans , " @entity16 tweeted wednesday			0
the abstract teal design has become a symbol of home for @entity38 over the last 27 years , welcoming an estimated 300 million people to the city			1
and after all those feet , it 's showing its age			2
the 2013 decision to replace the carpet with a new design sparked an outpouring of affection -- and not a small amount of capitalism -- from the @entity1 crowd			1
the @entity52 soccer team and the @entity53 's @entity20 have commemorated the @entity34 carpet , as it 's known by locals , by selling limited - edition t - shirts of the pattern in the team colors			1
a handful of true fanatics have even had the design permanently etched onto their skin			2
" it is definitely an endearing statement of how much ( @entity67 ) like the pattern , " says @entity63 , a communications officer for the @entity64			0
@entity69 , who sells socks with the @entity34 pattern through his online store , @entity73 , says the item has been a best - seller from the start			0
" my wife and i joke about it all the time , because when i made the initial order of 72 pair of socks she was , let 's just say , not that stoked about having that many pairs of teal socks lying around our apartment			2
but they sold out in the first hour that we posted them on our @entity93 accounts , " he said			0
the impending demise of the carpet has also inspired a @entity97 page , three @entity99 accounts and an @entity93 account -- all run independently by carpet groupies			1
@entity103 , who manages the @entity104 , notes that the carpet has a certain " @entity105			2
" " it seems like in most places , the carpet is there to fade into the background , but this has such a bright , cheerful eye - grabbing pattern			2
it 's also a symbol of making it home , " explains @entity103			0
" it 's also ugly , but in a really cute , endearing way , and @entity1 seems to love that			1
" despite the rampant nostalgia for the old floor covering , @entity63 says the carpet is overdue for a replacement : " we 're starting to see more than general wear and tear			0
the seams are showing , and you 're seeing frayed edges			0
in some spots , it 's so threadbare , the underlying mat pokes through , " she says			0
" it 's been on the floor for more than 20 years			1
someone did a calculation and figured about 300 million people have passed over it			0
" the new carpet design , created by @entity138 , has n't quite received the same love ( though it does at least have its own @entity99 account )			2
" i get that the old design is cool			0
it 's kind of quintessential 1980s , and it 's like an old friend we do n't want to leave behind , but it 's ok to have a new friend , too , " says @entity143 , principal at @entity144			0
