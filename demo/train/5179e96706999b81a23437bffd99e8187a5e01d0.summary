-- to the surprise of many , including me , president @entity1 has nominated former @entity5 sen. @entity4 to be his next defense secretary			1
like many @entity7 , i am grateful for @entity9 's courageous military service , but i fear he is the wrong man to lead the @entity10			1
one of the biggest foreign - policy challenges of @entity1 's second term is preventing @entity13 from acquiring nuclear weapons -- which means we need a defense secretary who understands the nature and magnitude of the @entity13 threat			1
based on his record , @entity9 does not			2
in july 2001 , 96 @entity24 senators voted to extend sanctions against @entity13			1
@entity4 was one of only two senators who voted against sanctions			1
a year later , he urged the @entity28 administration to support @entity13 membership in the @entity30			1
even more disturbing , @entity9 voted against a 2007 measure that called for the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) to be designated a terrorist group			2
( at the time , the @entity32 was aiding and equipping @entity35 militias that were murdering @entity24 troops in @entity37			0
) a few weeks after this vote , @entity9 sent a letter to president @entity28 asking him to launch " direct , unconditional , and comprehensive talks " with the @entity13 government , which the @entity41 has labeled a state sponsor of terrorism every year since 1984			1
in july 2008 , @entity9 recommended that @entity45 go beyond direct talks and establish a @entity24 diplomatic mission in @entity47			1
later that month , in a @entity50 vote , he was one of only two senators to oppose the @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			0
( @entity1 signed a subsequent version of this bill in july 2010			2
) finally , in his 2008 book , " @entity24 : our next chapter , " @entity9 appeared to suggest that the @entity24 could live with a nuclear @entity13 , writing that " the genie of nuclear armaments is already out of the bottle , no matter what @entity13 does			1
" these comments and actions indicate that he does not fully appreciate the dangers of a nuclear @entity13 or the character of the @entity13 regime			2
it is a regime that has effectively been at war with the @entity24 since 1979 -- a regime whose proxies ( such as the terrorist group @entity73 ) have killed @entity24 in @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity37 , and elsewhere			0
for that matter , @entity47 was recently implicated in a plot to blow up a restaurant ( and the @entity80 ambassador ) in our nation 's capital			0
this is not a government that calculates self - interest the way @entity24 does			0
it is a messianic theocracy intent on exporting its violent @entity90 revolution			0
and if @entity47 gets the bomb , we might soon have a nuclear arms race in one of the world 's most volatile regions			0
it is no exaggeration to say that a nuclear @entity13 represents an existential threat to @entity100			2
and yet , while @entity9 wants us to be softer on the @entity13 , he thinks we should be tougher on the @entity100			1
in october 2000 , at the beginning of the second @entity104 intifada , he was one of only four senators who refused to sign a letter to president @entity107 affirming @entity24 solidarity with @entity100			0
more recently , in january 2009 , @entity9 signed a letter advising @entity1 to spearhead direct , unconditional talks with @entity111 , a terrorist group that had just fired hundreds of rockets into @entity100			1
lest we forget , @entity111 is an @entity13 proxy whose senior leaders openly pray for genocidal violence against both @entity100 and @entity24			2
last year , for example , a @entity111 official named @entity119 , who serves as deputy speaker of the @entity121 , declared in a sermon , " oh @entity120 , destroy the @entity123 and their supporters			0
oh @entity120 , destroy the @entity24 and their supporters			0
oh @entity120 , count them one by one , and kill them all , without leaving a single one			0
" thus , by nominating @entity9 for defense secretary , the president has sent the worst possible message to our closest @entity132 ally and our greatest @entity132 enemy			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity136 .			0

@entity136 : @entity1 's defense secretary nominee , @entity4 , is wrong for the *job*
his actions show he does *n't* grasp the magnitude of @entity13 's threat , @entity136 says
@entity136 says @entity9 opposed @entity13 sanctions , urged @entity28 to hold talks
@entity136 : with @entity9 pick , @entity1 has sent the worst message to allies and foes
