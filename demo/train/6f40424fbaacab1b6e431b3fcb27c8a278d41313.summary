-- on @entity2 , we celebrate the mothers in our lives because we know motherhood is the hardest job any woman will ever have			1
but some have it harder than others			2
disasters can strike any place , any time			2
but , as @entity14 uncovered in its 15th annual @entity17 's mothers report , released tuesday , that devastation hurts some more than others : women and children are at the greatest risk and are 14 times more likely to die in a disaster than men			1
i 've met many of these mothers			1
they were huddled in a shelter in the @entity28 after @entity29 , one of the largest cyclones ever to hit land , destroyed their homes and livelihoods			2
they were also my own friends and neighbors who lost homes , businesses and belongings when @entity40 devastated parts of the @entity42			2
when president @entity45 visited the @entity28 last month , the @entity44 community had yet to be rebuilt			1
now there are devastated areas closer to home after storms across @entity50 and @entity51			2
the @entity14 report shows that children and mothers with the fewest resources often face the most daunting challenges during emergencies			1
in @entity40 's aftermath , it took weeks for relief efforts to reach hard - hit families living in some of @entity63 's low - income areas , such as @entity64 , @entity65			1
" this community was nowhere on any maps for five weeks for services , and for resources , and for help , " said @entity66 , executive director of the @entity67 in @entity64 , of the struggle to get supplies and services to the many mothers , babies and children who were stranded without electricity , water , food , supplies or transportation			1
in the @entity28 , @entity29 swept through the central part of the island nation , killing people and ruining housing , livelihoods and infrastructure across nine of the poorest regions			0
it damaged or destroyed more than 2,258 health facilities , including hundreds of village health stations , which provided primary health and childbirth services to people in smaller communities			0
at the time of the typhoon , in the region it hit , 250,000 women were pregnant and almost 70,000 were expected to deliver in early 2014			1
the @entity14 team met @entity105 , 25 , a mother of two toddlers			1
she went into labor at the peak of the storm as her entire neighborhood evacuated			0
her baby decided to come 10 days early			1
" i was scared because the typhoon was getting really strong			1
i was wondering whether i would be able to give birth			0
how long would i be in labor ? " @entity105 said			0
" i was worried about what kind of treatment my baby would get			0
it was a state of emergency and everyone was busy			0
i was praying to @entity120 to take care of me			0
" despite the storm , an ambulance arrived and took @entity124 to a clinic , where she gave birth to a healthy baby boy named @entity129			0
@entity105 's home was leveled , so she and her family are staying with relatives until they are able to rebuild			2
while i can not begin to imagine how frightening it must have been to go into labor during one of the most powerful typhoons ever recorded , having to protect your newborn as you 're fleeing for your life can be just as terrifying			0
@entity141 had given birth to a beautiful baby girl , @entity143 , only two weeks before @entity29 hit the shores of @entity145 , where she lived in an isolated , low - income community with her husband and three small children			1
like most families there , they did n't expect the storm to be as intense and waited too long to evacuate			0
once they had no choice but to leave , @entity141 wrapped her infant in thick cloth to keep her warm			0
the wind was so strong that they could n't even open the door of their house and had to climb out the window and then crawl up a mountain to find a safer place to shelter			2
" i 've been bleeding for a while after i gave birth and was afraid that i would have a relapse from the stress , " she said			0
" i was breast - feeding my baby during that entire time to help keep her calm and quiet			0
" the family was lucky to make it through the storm unscathed without needing medical services for the children , because about 82 % of the health facilities in the storm area were damaged			2
because of that , about 1.1 million people , including 163,000 children under 5 , have inadequate health services			2
whether in the @entity187 or the @entity28 , all mothers strive to ensure that their children are protected and healthy when a disaster strikes			1
what we need to do is strengthen community - based preparedness and early response			1
in areas of recurring crises , we need contingency planning and flexible funding -- and must engage women in the planning			1
we need social protection programs that meet the needs of the most vulnerable			0
and we need to invest more in reducing the risk of disasters			0
this includes more funding and greater integration of risk reduction into government and donor policies and programs			0
fortunately , our evidence also shows that we can save and dramatically improve the lives of all mothers and children , even in the most challenging places to live , if we invest in the services they need , including education .			1

@entity14 has released its 15th annual @entity17 's mothers report
