-- @entity2 's career at @entity3 is hanging in the balance after manager @entity5 gave the clearest indication yet that he is willing to sell the troubled striker			1
@entity5 admitted his patience was wearing thin with the 21 - year - old @entity9 who was sent off for the third time this season in @entity3 's 1 - 0 defeat at @entity14 on sunday			1
when asked if @entity2 would be sold , @entity5 said : " probably -- but i do n't know			1
it depends , because @entity2 is a fantastic player			1
" every time we risk one ( man being ) sent off , like today			2
but he can score also in the last minute			0
" it 's clear he 's created big problems , but he 's scored important goals			2
" he needs to change his behavior if he wants to improve his life			0
i 've seen players finish in two or three years with huge talent			0
" sunday 's loss leaves @entity3 eight points behind arch rivals @entity29 , dealing a potentially fatal blow to their @entity32 title hopes			1
@entity2 , who has earned a reputation for his controversial antics both on and off the pitch , was red - carded for a foul on @entity37 on sunday			2
he could also receive a retrospective punishment from the @entity39 for a dangerous tackle on @entity41 earlier in the game which match officials failed to see			1
replays showed @entity2 going in knee - high on the @entity14 midfielder , who escaped serious injury			1
but despite last week admitting @entity2 was so frustrating he would punch him if they were teammates , @entity5 refused to condemn the footballer outright			1
" i love him as a guy , i love him as a player , because i know him			0
he 's not a bad guy			0
he 's a fantastic player , " he said			0
" but , at this moment , i 'm very sorry because he continues to lose his talent , his quality			0
" i hope , for him , that he can understand that he 's in a bad way for his future , and he can change his behavior in the future			0
" it is the latest controversy for the forward who crashed his @entity64 in @entity65 last week			0
but with six games left for @entity3 this season and hopes of a first @entity72 title in 44 years all but dead in the water , @entity5 's own position at the club will also be under scrutiny			1
he insisted he was " 100 % " the right man for the job , saying : " when i arrived , @entity3 were seventh or eighth			2
after six months , we were fighting for the @entity78 and lost to @entity80 one game from the end			0
