-- it was billed as a showdown between king and country : @entity6 's imperious @entity5 versus @entity8 's exciting @entity7			2
in the end it was 40 - 1 shot @entity11 , ridden by @entity12 , who delivered a shock result in the first classic of the @entity16 season			1
racing is a sport of many long and proud traditions			2
the newest of these is surely the preoccupation , in the run up to the @entity24 , with identifying the " next @entity25			1
" perhaps inevitably , @entity5 , running in the same green , pink and white colours of @entity27 , had bourn the brunt of this fevered speculation			2
a star turn in the @entity31 -- a race also won by @entity25 en route to his guineas in 2011 -- did nothing to quell racing fans ' hopes that lightening could , perhaps , strike twice			1
@entity5 's only vulnerability appeared to be the ground -- he needed surgery last year to remove a bone chip and connections were concerned about the going being too fast			0
in the end it was not drought but thunder they should have worried about			0
the 14 - runner field had split into two groups at the start of the race , with one group , containing pre-race favorite @entity5 and @entity11 , being lead by @entity55 challenger @entity54 , while the second was headed by @entity11 's more fancied stable mate @entity57			1
as the two groups approached the final half - furlong , @entity5 's jockey @entity58 looked to have timed his run perfectly on the outside , with @entity62 and @entity7 matching him stride - for - stride on the inside			1
@entity11 , however , appeared on @entity5 's flank and looked set to take him on , before taking an unexplained detour to join @entity7 on the stands side			0
powered home despite losing valuable seconds in the switch , @entity11 powered home to win by half a length			0
@entity5 and @entity7 were split by a head in second and third respectively			0
it was a first @entity14 win , on paper , at least , for @entity74 , @entity75 , who took the reins of his father 's training operation just this season			1
the normally voluble @entity74 was lost for words as the plaudits rained down on his champion			0
" it 's the stuff of dreams , " said @entity74			0
" as a school boy you dream of days like this -- you think you might get there one day , and you might not			0
but we 've done it			0
" by contrast , @entity11 's veteran jockey @entity91 , is a previous four - time winner of this race			1
the 49 - year - old has seen his fair share of ups and downs in a colorful career which has seen him crowned @entity99 six times yet also serve lengthy bans following accusations of race fixing and testing positive for banned substances			1
" it 's brilliant , " said @entity91 , whose last win in the race came in 2006			0
" it 's a great race to win and it kick - starts our confidence for the year			2
" from here , thoughts inevitably turn to the @entity112 , the next of the @entity16 " classics " on the calendar			1
@entity7 , on pedigree , should have his best chance at @entity119 ( he is the son of a @entity112 winner and an @entity122 winner ) , while @entity5 has shown too much class in his career to date to be written off just yet			2
the search for the next @entity25 goes on			0
@entity126 breaks 1,000 guineas duck in the fillies ' equivalent sunday , @entity130 raider @entity128 delivered the goods under jockey @entity133 to give master trainer @entity126 his first victory in the @entity135			1
tucked in behind early pacesetter @entity137 , miss @entity128 showed a devastating turn of foot to beat a fast - finishing @entity141 in a thrilling finish			1
it was a marked change of tactics for the winner of the @entity146			2
24 - time @entity130 champion trainer @entity126 told reporters that the ride was " the exact opposite of the way i wanted her ridden -- but it worked			1
" it is expected she will now be targeted at the " @entity122 " -- the @entity122 .			0

night of @entity141 wins *2,000* @entity24
40 - 1 shot triumphed in first classic of the @entity16 season
@entity12 rode his fifth @entity24 winner
new : first 1,000 guineas for master trainer @entity126
