-- ferrets could be making a comeback in the @entity3			2
the furry , four - legged animal -- long absent from the city -- could weasel its way back into the hearts of @entity9 based on a petition submitted to the @entity11 asking it to repeal the city 's 15 - year ban on ferrets as pets			1
the city 's @entity11 and @entity18 said wednesday that it is considering an amendment to the @entity20			2
@entity21 , a @entity23 master 's student , said she drafted the petition in january because she has always loved ferrets and wants to correct the current @entity20 , which she claims contains many inaccuracies about ferrets			1
" i looked into the @entity20 and i saw that they were labeled as wild , dangerous animals , and that confused me because ferrets have been domesticated for over 2,000 years , " @entity25 told @entity0			2
" they were actually domesticated before the cat , " @entity25 said			0
owning a ferret is legal in 48 states , including in the remainder of @entity34 , she added			1
@entity25 said that as part of her petition , she recommended mandatory rabies vaccinations for the animals , spaying and neutering , leash laws , as well as micro-chipping requirements so that they can be tracked if anyone gets rid of them			0
the city 's ban on ferrets dates back to june 1999 under then - mayor @entity48			1
the @entity49 said in its announcement that it would be irresponsible from a public safety perspective to allow a ferret to be kept as a pet in @entity9 , citing their unpredictable behavior and reports that they are prone to attacking humans			2
that same year , @entity48 had a famous dust - up with a ferret lover during his " @entity62 " radio show			1
" there 's something deranged about you , " @entity48 said to caller and ferret advocate @entity64			1
" the excessive concern that you have for ferrets is something you should examine with a therapist			2
" the @entity72 calls ferrets " cute and inquisitive " and lists them as belonging to a family of animals that includes weasels and minks -- not rodents			0
and the @entity79 has them on a list of species suitable as companion animals along with dogs , cats and birds			0
mayor @entity87 upheld his predecessor 's ferret ban , but current mayor @entity90 has not spoken about the issue			1
but he has already been labeled an animal lover by some after his efforts to remove @entity96 carriage horses from their " congested , urban setting			0
" @entity0 's attempts to reach @entity90 wednesday went unanswered			0
" i think there are more important things for the mayor to focus on , " resident @entity99 told @entity0			0
" there 's income distribution problems , rent problems , crime , bigger issues on the agenda than to worry about whether or not people are allowed to own ferrets			1
" " i 'm an animal lover so if the owner of these ferrets will give them a great life and great experience in this city then i 'm all for it , " resident @entity111 said			1
" but there greater things in the city that need to be addressed than little furry elongated creatures scurrying along hardwood floors of apartments			0
" the @entity49 , led by @entity127 appointee dr. @entity126 , said that a public hearing and comment period will be held in the fall , followed by a @entity132 vote			0
@entity0 's @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 contributed to this report .			0
