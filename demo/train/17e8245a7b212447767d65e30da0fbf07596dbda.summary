-- the battle for men 's tennis supremacy in 2012 will boil down to the @entity4 at @entity5 , according to former world number one @entity7			1
the @entity10 @entity9 captain has watched the world 's top players at close quarters this year and believes there is nothing to divide @entity17 champion @entity16 , @entity19 winner @entity18 and @entity21 gold medalist @entity20			1
@entity22 would also come into that category , but the @entity25 champion will miss the @entity27 event with a knee injury which also prevented him taking part at @entity30			0
" the winner of the final slam of the season will have added a second major title to their record and can justifiably claim to be @entity40 , " @entity7 told @entity0 's @entity31 ahead of monday 's opening matches at the two - week hard - court tournament			1
the four - time grand slam champion said @entity20 's @entity21 triumph in the men 's singles this month , when where he beat @entity18 in straight sets in the final , had elevated him to the same status as the other three			1
" it used to be three and a half , now it 's the big four , " @entity7 said			2
" @entity20 has momentum with him and has been unbelievably consistent			0
" but when pressed to predict the winner in @entity27 , @entity7 opted for defending champion @entity16 , believing he can return to the form which saw him totally dominate in 2011 " and on his best surface			1
" the @entity56 started his @entity10 hard court swing by easily retaining his @entity60 crown where he beat @entity61 in straight sets in the final			0
he ca n't reclaim the no. 1 ranking from @entity18 even if he wins the september 8 final , but it would set him up for the end - of - year honors ahead of november 's @entity66			2
@entity20 upbeat about @entity4 despite crashing in @entity67 @entity68 won his opening match in @entity70 but then withdrew with a knee injury , and suffered a shock early exit in @entity67 as he failed to defend his title			2
with @entity18 also in superb form , thrashing @entity16 in the @entity67 final , @entity7 can not see outside the top three seeds			1
but he nominated 2009 champion @entity78 , who took @entity21 bronze at @entity19 , @entity80 world no. 6 @entity81 and @entity82 , who has performed heroics in the @entity86 march to the semifinals of the @entity9 , as dangerous outsiders			1
" you would not have any of those in your part of the draw , " he said			0
for @entity7 , who won two @entity96 opens and two @entity25 crowns , the choice of women 's champion is easier			1
" @entity103 , " said the 42 - year - old , who lost in the finals of the 1991 @entity4 and @entity19 two years later			1
" she played ridiculously well in the @entity21			2
" @entity19 champion @entity103 will be bidding for her fourth @entity4 crown and 15th grand slam title , but she surprisingly lost to @entity96 @entity106 in last year 's final when looking similarly invincible			1
she also slipped up in the @entity108 event in @entity67 this month with a quarterfinal loss to @entity110 -- her first defeat since exiting early at the @entity25 in june			0
after the @entity4 , @entity7 will take the @entity86 team to @entity113 to face @entity9 champions @entity114 as the @entity86 bid to reach the final for the first time since 2007			1
they thrashed @entity18 's @entity119 team 5 - 0 in february and beat @entity81 's @entity80 3 - 2 in april			0
" we 're not going to beat the @entity121 -- but we were n't going to beat the @entity119 or the @entity80 either , " @entity7 said			0
" you look on paper at our matches this year -- away , on clay , against great teams -- we should be playing a relegation match now rather than the semifinals			0
" the @entity130 brothers , they 've won everything , done everything			0
@entity82 's been a real threat to everyone he 's played in @entity9 and @entity136 came up big for us in @entity119 with a singles win and doubles win			2
we 've put together a true team effort			0
" @entity7 will be taking on some of the finest tennis players in modern history in the 12 - city @entity143 that he helped create			0
@entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 will be among the big names taking part in a whistlestop tour of the @entity86 from mid october to the end of november .			0
