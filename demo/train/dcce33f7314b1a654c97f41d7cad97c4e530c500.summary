it was during the throes of the @entity2 , with lots of bloody and brutal fighting still ahead , when president @entity5 turned his attention to the @entity7 and the @entity9 areas of @entity10			1
@entity5 's signature on the @entity13 bill on june 30 , 1864 , set a precedent for the preservation of the young country 's wilderness			0
that act 150 years ago was the first instance of the @entity21 government setting aside scenic wilderness for public use and preservation			1
the act put both tracts of land in trust for the state of @entity10 , and it set the stage for the 1872 establishment of @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 as the first national park			2
calling it a " remarkable message of hope for a nation embroiled in a bloody civil war , " @entity38 director @entity37 suggested @entity5 's actions may have been " assuring the nation of better times ahead , as if he knew that @entity21 would need places where they could go and find peace in the perfection of the natural world			0
" the land around the grove and the valley became @entity55 in 1890			0
both pieces of land were re-acquired by the federal government and combined with the national park in 1906 , which created the park much as we know it today			1
@entity9 now hosts 3.7 million visitors annually , and the numbers are expected to swell for anniversary events through october			1
but the glorious groves of ancient sequoias , spectacular waterfalls and 750 miles of trails that are now @entity55 's 1,200 square miles are a joy for travelers to visit any time of year			0
