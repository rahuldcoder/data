-- early in 2002 , shortly after the @entity4 overthrow of the @entity2 regime , @entity2 leader @entity1 phoned @entity7 president @entity6 asking for a job			1
as a member of the same tribe , he had known the @entity6 family for years , and was hoping to use this link to switch allegiances to the new @entity4 - backed @entity7 government , a move typical of the twists and turns of the country 's 30 years of war			1
@entity6 promised to help , and referred @entity1 to his brother @entity20 , a close @entity21 ally based in @entity23 province			2
@entity20 agreed to send a representative to meet @entity1 in @entity25			0
but before this could transpire , a rival @entity2 figure alerted the @entity25 border police to @entity1 's presence			1
he was arrested , handed over to the @entity4 , and sent to @entity29			0
@entity1 is one of the five @entity2 leaders who were released from @entity29 over the weekend in a deal for sgt. @entity32 , the lone @entity4 pow in @entity33 and @entity7			1
i learned of @entity1 's story , which is corroborated in his @entity29 detainee files , from interviews with the late @entity20 and other @entity7 government officials			1
in fact , all five of the swapped prisoners were initially captured while trying to cut deals , and like @entity1 , three had been attempting to join , or had already joined , the @entity7 government at the time of their arrest			1
this history shows that the categories we take as rigid and unchanging , such as " terrorist , " are in fact remarkably fluid in the context of @entity7 politics			1
uncovering the stories of these men tells us much about @entity29 , the @entity2 , and the possibility of a negotiated end to the conflict			1
@entity58 : i do n't apologize for @entity60 swap @entity61 , the most junior ranking of the five , was a small - time commander linked to @entity64 strongman @entity63 in the 1990s			1
after 2001 , he was among the many @entity63 followers who switched allegiances to the @entity6 government			2
@entity68 , another @entity69 commander who switched sides , remembers him vividly			0
" @entity61 was angry with the @entity2 for throwing the country away ( for @entity73 ) , " he said in a 2010 interview			1
" he would sit there and tell me , ' if i see a @entity2 , i wo n't even let him take a piss , i 'm going to turn him in			1
' " @entity68 , @entity61 , and other former @entity63 commanders began working for the @entity21			0
in his @entity29 file , @entity61 describes dealing with an @entity4 named " @entity78			0
" " we worked for the @entity4 , " @entity68 recalls			0
" we met them regularly to get instructions and give intelligence			0
" in those days , the @entity4 was handing out money freely for such intelligence , which inadvertently provided incentive for bogus accusations			0
some @entity7 officials in @entity88 allege that @entity61 reaped profits from falsely accusing others of @entity92 membership			2
if so , he certainly accrued enemies , and in september 2002 , he , too , was accused of insurgent membership by rival warlords and politicians , despite being publicly aligned with the @entity6 government			2
" he was on our side , " said @entity68 , who now lives in @entity98			0
" and then all of a sudden , he was in @entity29			0
" in october 2001 , @entity101 , another of the five , traveled to @entity102 for a clandestine meeting with the @entity21 and @entity7 warlords in an attempt to strike a deal			1
@entity101 worked with the @entity2 's spy agency , and he was negotiating on behalf of his boss , according to the memoir of @entity110 , then deputy chief of operations at the @entity21 's @entity113			2
the @entity21 , however , was not interested in reconciliation , only in intelligence leading to @entity73 or other top @entity92 figures			0
@entity101 could not deliver this because he , like most @entity2 members , did not actually have access to the @entity120			2
so the @entity4 team bound and gagged @entity101 and his companion , eventually shipping them to @entity29			0
the six soldiers at center of @entity127 debate of the five , only mullah @entity128 and @entity129 were significant military commanders			0
in november 2001 , as their movement was collapsing around them , they surrendered , along with their foot soldiers , to the @entity4 - backed warlord @entity136			0
( @entity128 is a notorious human rights violator , as is @entity136 )			0
years earlier , @entity128 had helped @entity136 escape a precarious battlefield situation , and he engineered the deal in the hopes of having the favor returned			2
but @entity136 sold them to the @entity4 and massacred hundredsâ € ” some sources say thousandsâ € ” of their foot soldiers and conscripts by suffocating them in shipping containers			0
instead of being recalcitrant terrorists bent on fighting @entity4 , this history indicates that all five can make pragmatic deals if the conditions are right			0
does this mean they wo n't pose a threat upon their release ? how big a terror risk are former @entity29 prisoners ? it 's difficult to say ; two @entity2 commanders who surrendered to @entity136 alongside @entity128 and @entity129 were also sent to @entity29			2
upon their release in 2007 , they quickly joined the insurgency and rose to its top ranks			2
@entity165 , who was arrested with @entity101 , has rejoined the fight since his release that same year			0
on the other hand , other @entity2 leaders have successfully returned to civilian life after their @entity29 release , including @entity2 ambassador @entity172 , commerce minister mullah @entity173 , and gov. @entity174			1
what is clear , though , is that with the ongoing turnover of the @entity2 's mid- and senior - level leadership in recent years , the arrival of a few individuals to @entity178 is unlikely to make a significant impact on the battlefield in @entity7			1
who was swapped for @entity60 ? so , the cost of the prisoner swap may be low , but the potential payoff is high			1
in a country that has seen few openings for peace in the last decade , this could mark the first tangible step toward a negotiated settlement			1
there is little trust , understandably , between the @entity2 and the @entity4 , and in this vein the mutual release of prisoners could be a confidence building measure			2
to be sure , a grand deal may never comeâ € ” there are many divergent interests within the @entity2 , their patrons in @entity25 , and @entity7 society at large			1
but when endless war is the only alternative , even the most difficult paths are worth pursuing			0
@entity207 wanted tougher deal for @entity60 who is @entity60 ? what 's the legal case for the @entity60 swap ?			1

5 @entity2 leaders are released in a deal to trade for pow sgt. @entity60
@entity217 : three of the five had joined or tried to join the @entity7 government
he says the notion of " terrorist " is remarkably fluid in the context of @entity7 politics
@entity217 : prisoner swap could be a step toward a negotiated settlement
