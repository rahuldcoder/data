-- the @entity1 is n't leaving anything to chance			1
while it pursues a diplomatic solution to the @entity7 crisis by sending secretary of state @entity8 to meet with his @entity10 counterpart in @entity11 , @entity12 , on thursday , it has also started arming the rebels			1
two rebel groups , though , say the arms have yet to reach them			0
meanwhile , a @entity20 - penned editorial in the @entity21 has at least one @entity18 official saying it 's an indication the @entity10 president is " now fully invested in @entity7 's chemical disarmament			1
" and a @entity25 report says that both sides -- the regime and the rebels -- have committed war crimes in @entity7 's bloody 2 - year - old civil war			1
here are the five things to pay attention to today			0
giving peace a chance as the diplomatic focus shifts to @entity11 , the talks get down to the nuts and bolts of how to identify , verify and ultimately destroy the @entity7 regime 's chemical weapons stockpile , a senior @entity36 official told @entity0			1
expect the sessions to last two or three days			0
a final deal may take much longer , but the @entity36 says the @entity1 is looking for a " credible and authentic way forward " that is " verifiable and that can happen expeditiously			1
" @entity8 and @entity10 foreign minister @entity47 have talked nine times since an august 21 chemical weapons attack in @entity7 that prompted the @entity1 to urge military action against the regime			1
@entity1 , @entity53 and @entity54 diplomats also are hashing over similar matters in @entity56			1
a senior @entity36 official says the @entity7 opposition is not pleased about recent developments			1
" they 're upset , " the official says " they do n't trust this at all			2
" these are complicated matters with competing interests			0
expect any final deal to go to the @entity67 to be put into a formal resolution			0
and to add to the intrigue , @entity54 foreign minister @entity69 says the @entity25 report on last month 's attack will probably be published monday			1
and there will " certainly be indications " that the attack originated with @entity7 president @entity77 's regime , he said in a radio interview thursday			1
looming over the talks is the military strike card that president @entity81 continues to hold			1
he asked @entity82 this week to put the authorization on hold , but the card is n't going back in the deck just yet			0
" this is the way that diplomacy works , " said former secretary of state @entity87 , who was @entity1 's top diplomat in the @entity90 administration			1
" you use the threat of the use of force to get some action in diplomacy , and then diplomacy just to figure out what you do about the threat of the use of force			0
" still , some say it does n't give the @entity18 a lot of wiggle room			0
" if diplomacy fails , he 's painted himself into a corner , " said sen. @entity108 , @entity110 - @entity109			2
" the leader of the free world ca n't say all these things at the end of the day and do nothing			0
rebels and their guns these things do n't happen quickly			2
it was back in june that officials familiar with the matter told @entity0 that the @entity1 planned to send small arms , ammunition and , potentially , anti-tank weapons to @entity7 's rebels			1
concerns about who the @entity18 could trust kept the process on the slow track			0
funded and organized by the @entity134 , the weapons began reaching moderate @entity7 rebels two weeks ago , a @entity1 official tells @entity0			1
" a coordinated effort is being made among the many supporters of the moderate opposition to get them the assistance they need , " @entity8 said during a @entity137 discussion this week			2
not so , opposition groups said thursday			2
the @entity143 and the @entity144 deny they have received weapons			2
" we have some promises from the @entity1 administration of shipment of weapons in a short period of time , but until now we have not received any , " said @entity146 , the @entity144 political and media coordinator			1
we 're waiting to see what the @entity18 has to say about that			0
relieved of an impending vote on whether to give the president the authorization to attack @entity7 , @entity82 is moving on to other matters			2
yet , @entity7 continues to bubble under the surface			2
" @entity82 will be watching these negotiations very closely , " senate majority leader @entity166 warns			0
" if there is any indication they 're not serious or they 're being used as a ploy to delay , then @entity82 stands ready to return " to a resolution that would authorize a military strike on @entity7			2
whether the votes are there to approve such a resolution is another matter			0
but for now , there 's a different deadline looming over @entity82			2
if there 's no spending plan by early october , there could be a government shutdown			2
pointing fingers finger - pointing is a popular pastime when the topic is @entity7			1
the government blames the rebels			2
the rebels blame the government			0
a @entity25 report , released wednesday , says that both sides have committed grave crimes in violation of international law			0
the @entity196 says government forces are committing crimes against humanity by attacking civilian populations			0
war crimes like murder , torture and hostage - taking are the charges against the opposition			0
" there is no military solution to this conflict , " the report says			0
" those who supply arms create but an illusion of victory			0
" denials and more finger - pointing are likely from both sides			0
@entity20 's turn @entity81 got his say tuesday			1
on wednesday night , @entity20 took a stab at winning friends and influencing people in a piece published by @entity21			1
in the op - ed , @entity20 says it 's time " to speak directly to the @entity1 people and their political leaders			1
" he challenges @entity81 across the board			2
he says striking @entity7 would kill innocent people , spread violence across the region and cloud other @entity233 peace efforts			2
it would also " unleash a new wave of terrorism			0
" he said skipping the @entity25 to go it alone " would constitute an act of aggression			0
" the sarin gas attack ? that 's in there too			0
while @entity81 squarely puts the blame for the alleged sarin attack on the @entity77 regime , @entity20 writes , " there is every reason to believe it was used not by the @entity7 army , but by opposition forces to provoke intervention by their powerful foreign patrons , who would be siding with the fundamentalists			1
" not a lot of middle ground as talks start in @entity11			1
@entity257 sen. @entity256 of @entity258 said the piece made him almost want to throw up			0
@entity20 ended with a swipe at @entity81 , with a reference to the tuesday night address in which the president said that while @entity1 ca n't be a global cop , it ought to act in certain situations			1
" that 's what makes us exceptional , " @entity81 said			1
" with humility , but with resolve , let us never lose sight of that essential truth			0
" @entity20 's answer to that ? " it is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional , whatever the motivation , " he wrote			1
" we are all different , " the @entity10 leader concluded , " but when we ask for the @entity280 's blessings , we must not forget that @entity281 created us equal			1
" the @entity282 responded with variations on " oh no , he did n't ! " but the administration 's reaction was to brush it off			0
a senior @entity18 official says it 's " all irrelevant , " suggesting that @entity20 is already all in when it comes to forcing @entity7 to give up its chemical weapons			1
@entity20 " now owns this , " the official added of the @entity10 plan to have @entity7 's leadership give up its chemical weapons			1
" he has fully asserted ownership of it , and he needs to deliver			0
" let 's see if he does			0
@entity0 's @entity296 , @entity297 , @entity298 , @entity299 , @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity299 and @entity303 contributed to this report .			0
