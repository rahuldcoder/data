at the @entity1 , it 's the @entity3			1
the doors of the @entity5 opened as usual thursday morning in @entity6 , @entity7 , but this day is not going to be typical			1
when a historically giant sinkhole suddenly appears inside one of the world 's sanctuaries of uber - cool cars as it did wednesday , it changes the mental landscape a bit			1
a 40 - foot - wide , 20 - to - 30 - foot deep chasm tends to shake you up , say folks who 've seen the hole with their own eyes			1
no one was hurt , but the mood in the museum is somber			1
they 're a bit less shaken than they were wednesday , when the sinkhole swallowed eight priceless corvettes inside a part of the museum called the @entity30			1
" we 've been given an ok and everything is safe , " said museum spokeswoman @entity31			1
about a dozen visitors were exploring the place thursday morning , she said , but the @entity30 remains closed indefinitely			1
nature 's disturbance of this holy site started a wave of concern across the @entity41 that continued to ripple around the web thursday			1
" who could fathom such a thing ? " asked @entity2 commenter 440sixpack			0
" i do n't live anywhere near this sort of geological risk , but still i 'm tempted to arrange for a sub-surface analysis under my own garage just so i can still sleep good			0
" fans at @entity52 asked the question : why could n't this " have happened to a @entity55 museum instead ? " ' @entity58 fans have been stepping forward to help			2
auto parts store owner @entity59 told reporters he 's volunteering to find any replacement parts to restore the cars			1
@entity64 -- a 1962 " @entity65 " -- a 1984 @entity67 pace car -- a 2009 @entity68 " -- the 1992 white " 1 @entity69 " -- a 1993 ruby red " 40th @entity70 " -- a 2001 @entity72 -- the 2009 white " 1.5 @entity69 " -- a 1993 @entity73 source : @entity5 so , what the hell happened ? how could a gaping hole just appear in such a wrong place ? keep in mind that this is cave country			0
@entity81 is the home of @entity83 , the largest known cave system in the world			0
sinkholes pop up constantly in these parts , usually caused by ground water eroding underground limestone over many years , forming a void underneath the surface of the earth			2
eventually , the soil that was above the dissolving limestone has nothing to support it anymore , and it collapses			0
" right now , the ground at the museum seems like it 's pretty stable , " said @entity97 geologist @entity96			1
experts have assessed and inspected the entire building using ground monitoring equipment			2
engineer @entity103 , a 22 - year professor at @entity97 , said sinkholes rarely form in clusters			0
" the likelihood that another is going to drop out is possible , but unlikely			0
" " the contractor in charge will certainly want to do some investigation to verify that we do n't have any other issues in the building that we know of , " @entity103 said			0
that contractor , @entity115 of @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 , acknowledged that his business runs across at least one of these sinkhole situations every month			2
" the only difference is this one swallowed eight collector corvettes , " he said			2
" but it is repairable			0
" he assured reporters thursday the building was " in good condition , and the foundation and structure is in good condition			0
oh , the humanity ! some of them , @entity103 said , are buried so deep in the hole that they ca n't be seen from the surface			0
" it 's fascinating , and sad , " he said thursday morning on the phone			2
but " the timing could have been a lot worse , " @entity103 said			0
@entity143 closed circuit security video shows the hole opening up early wednesday morning before the museum was scheduled to open			2
" there are times where there are so many people in that room , you ca n't even move around			0
" some of the museum workers were busy washing the cars that survived the sinkhole			1
" i ca n't say we 've ever had to clear concrete dust off of our cars before , " @entity31 said			0
" they have to be really careful			0
" @entity96 , who spent most of wednesday at the sinkhole site , said " the whole experience was surreal , " adding that " it was definitely lucky for the people -- not so much for the @entity163			1
" by the way , for the record , he says he 's a ' @entity58 fan -- but he drives a @entity167			2
for right now , @entity103 says the risk is extremely minimal			0
the @entity30 has been closed to the public , while visitors will be able to tour the rest of the facility			1
another stroke of luck : the dome 's round shape makes it less likely to collapse on itself , @entity103 said			2
but about 10 % of the concrete footing supporting the structure 's signature red spire , which shoots high over the museum , has been " undermined " somewhat			1
" we do have to shore it up even though part of it is bearing on bedrock , " he explained			0
the @entity30 has a long road to recovery			1
it will take at least four to six days to pull the @entity163 out of the chasm , and then construction crews will begin filling in the hole , @entity117 said			1
timing may have been good for the @entity30 , but it was bad on another level			1
the sinkhole comes as the museum prepares to celebrate its 20th anniversary this august			1
big doings are in the works , including the grand opening of a new nearby @entity202 , where sinkholes were found and dealt with during construction			0
" sinkholes are so common here that i would have been shocked if they had n't found any , " @entity103 said			0
but museum executive director @entity207 said the @entity30 will reopen in time for the festivities			1
" august is our target date , " he said			0
how do you fix a sinkhole ? you can fill it in with dirt or other types of material			2
or sometimes , it 's impossible to fix , and the location has to be abandoned			2
it depends on the situation , said @entity96			0
discussions about how to proceed with the museum sinkhole are expected to continue thursday , and there 's no firm plan yet			1
no one really knows how long it will be before we know if the @entity30 will survive this attack by @entity229			1
hopefully , said @entity96 , " the sooner the better			0
" @entity2 's @entity230 contributed to this report .			0

it will take up to six days to pull the @entity163 out of the chasm , an expert says
museum opens a day after sinkhole eats 8 priceless corvettes
other parts of museum are safe , experts say
too soon to tell if museum 's *iconic* *yellow* @entity30 will survive
