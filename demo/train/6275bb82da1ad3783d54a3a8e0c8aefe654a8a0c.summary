@entity0 -- @entity2 -- a @entity3 citizen -- was held in jail by the @entity3 government for 16 days as a " material witness " in an ongoing terror investigation			1
he was never charged , and never called to testify			2
now the @entity8 will decide whether the @entity10 native can hold former @entity12 administration officials -- especially onetime attorney general @entity13 -- personally liable for wrongful arrest and detention			1
in oral arguments wednesday , the justices appeared split along conservative - liberal lines about both the immunity question and the larger issue of when the government can hold in custody citizens it is unable to charge , for fear they may commit future crimes , including terrorism			1
chief justice @entity27 said allowing such a lawsuit to proceed would impose a " heavy burden " on government officials and police as they do their jobs , for fear " if they guess wrong , it comes out of their pocket			1
" but justice @entity37 called @entity2 's experience " obvious mistreatment " that perhaps should leave someone accountable			2
the case -- with its issue of the limits of " preventive " detention , especially in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks -- is the only national security case the high court will address this term			1
material witness laws allow officials to detain those who may have knowledge of crimes committed by others to ensure they would testify in criminal proceedings , including before a grand jury and at trial			1
@entity59 lawyers representing @entity2 say the government has warped the law to allow open - ended arrests and confinement of citizens , without being later held accountable for those wrongfully held			1
@entity66 was a college football player at the @entity67 when he converted to @entity68 , changing his name from @entity70			2
he eventually began volunteering at an @entity68 charity led by a person being investigated for possible terrorism ties			2
he was never implicated in wrongdoing , but was interviewed repeatedly and voluntarily by the @entity75			2
he was never told his testimony would be needed in any prosecution , nor was he forbidden to leave the country			2
six months later , in march 2003 , @entity2 was about to board a plane at @entity80 outside @entity0 , headed for @entity82 study region for his doctorate			2
but he was arrested by government agents armed with a material warrant			1
an affidavit submitted to a federal magistrate said @entity2 had a one - way first class plane ticket , and that he was " crucial " to the prosecution of @entity90			1
it was later revealed the ticket was two - way -- indicating he planned to return to the @entity3 -- and he would fly coach class			1
in his lawsuit , @entity2 says he was held in three prisons in @entity97 , @entity98 , and @entity99 , under high security with convicted criminals			1
he says he was routinely shackled , strip - searched , and left naked in a freezing cell while male and female guards watched			1
he was freed after more than two weeks , but only after agreeing to surrender his passport and confine his travel , among other conditions			2
he now teaches in @entity82 and did not attend oral arguments at the high court			0
@entity109 , meanwhile , was charged with visa fraud and making false statements			0
he was acquitted one some of the charges but the jury deadlocked on others			0
he agreed to be deported to avoid a retrial			0
@entity66 later sued corrections officials ; that suit was settled out of court			1
but it is his separate suit against @entity13 , holding him personally accountable as head of the @entity122 , that is the heart of the current legal fight			0
a federal appeals court had allowed his civil lawsuit to continue , but @entity13 argues officials under his supervision obeyed the letter and spirit of the material witness law			1
an arrest warrant was properly obtained under the law they said , and even if there were improper motives behind this particular detention , @entity13 would still enjoy " absolute " immunity			1
previous lawsuits by a variety of civil liberty and human rights groups naming @entity13 and other top @entity12 officials -- including vice president @entity143 , secretary of defense @entity144 , and fbi director @entity145 -- have almost unanimously been tossed out by federal courts on immunity grounds			1
in oral arguments , the justices debated the immediate intent of @entity2 's detention : was it to ensure his assistance in an ongoing prosecution , or was it aimed at unlimited detention and investigation ? @entity66 claims investigators held him in a desperate attempt to implicate him in the investigation of his friend			1
some members of the bench were clearly uncomfortable with the idea of blanket immunity for the highest government officials , whatever their reasons			1
" prosecutors can out of spite , out of pure investigative reasoning , out of whatever motive they have , just lock people up , " said justice @entity168 , while clarifying that may not be what happened in @entity2 's case			0
justice @entity37 was more blunt , calling some of the allegations " very disturbing			0
" " we are talking about the attorney general and the attorney general 's immunity , " she told the @entity122 lawyer arguing the case			0
" but there are allegations here that this man was kept awake , the lights shining in his cell for 24 hours , kept without clothes			0
now that does n't sound like the way one would treat someone whose testimony you want			0
is there a remedy that he has for that obvious mistreatment ? " on the other side , @entity27 warned making it easier to sue for violations of the law would open the floodgates to endless lawsuits			1
" the allegation can so readily be made in every case under the material witness statute ... that this is one of those ' bad intent ' cases , and the case has to proceed so that we can prove that			1
" @entity27 wondered what an officer faced with deciding whether to proceed with a terror investigation or similarly serious matter would think			0
" if i 'm the officer in that situation , i say , ' well , i 'm just not going to run the risk of having to sell the house ' " because his decision could be overturned someday by a court			0
justice @entity224 is not participating in the case because she helped brief the case for the government last year as solicitor general , just before joining the high court			0
that leaves the possibility of a 4 - 4 tie , which would give victory to @entity2 , allowing his lawsuit to proceed			1
@entity13 has the support of the @entity237 administration , which argued the case in the high court , as well as several former attorneys general			2
" we think the way that one vindicates one 's rights is to use the process that is available to those that are arrested to seek their release , " said @entity241 of the @entity242 , who filed the supporting brief			0
" and in fact , mr. @entity2 did exactly that			0
he had a lawyer appointed for him			0
he went into court on several occasions and within 15 days after the time of his arrest he was released			2
" but about 30 former federal prosecutors are backing @entity2			0
@entity260 , the @entity59 attorney , told @entity1 the government should not be allowed to do an " end run " around the law			0
" our client would like vindication for his own rights			0
he would like to see his reputation cleared			0
but i think , perhaps most of all in his mind , he would like to see the court say that this can not be done anymore and so it does n't happen to people in the future			0
" the case is @entity276 ( 10 - 98 )			2
a ruling is due by late june .			0

@entity279 was held for 16 days as a material witness
