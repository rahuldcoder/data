-- i spent part of my childhood in @entity4 , @entity5 , and part of it in @entity7 , @entity8			1
the school i attended in @entity4 was a local building where they strictly followed the @entity5 curriculum			1
my classroom oversaw a large courtyard , which we could n't see from our benches during class hours since all the windows had been half - painted in gray			2
who had done it , i often wondered			2
whose idea was it to cover the windows in such a dull color to prevent us from peering into the world outside ? the school i attended in @entity7 was an international college with a predominantly @entity29 curriculum			2
i was the only turk there			2
there were interesting contrasts between the two institutions , each of which left an impact on my young mind and soul			0
but the distinction that perhaps struck me most was the presence and the absence in each of " the national oath "			1
in @entity4 , every monday morning we would gather in the schoolyard , hundreds of us , wearing black uniforms and snow - white lace collars			0
turning our faces towards the bust of @entity48 -- the founder of modern @entity5 -- and keeping our arms straight like soldiers , we would chant in perfect unison : " i am a @entity1 , i am correct , i am diligent ... " and we would finish the oath with the same pledge : " may my existence be a gift to you ! " it was that final line that disturbed me deep inside			1
i just wanted to be myself			0
nothing more , nothing less			0
why was my being an offering to the @entity5 state and the @entity5 nation ? could i not have a @entity62 separate from the collective @entity62 ? as years went by i started asking new questions : was there room for individuality in the @entity5 society ? if so what were its limits and why ? generations in @entity5 have grown up repeating the national oath			1
even if you were @entity74 you were still expected to say aloud , " i am a @entity1			0
" it was assumed that we all shared the same nationality ( @entity5 ) and the same religion ( @entity78 ) -- even those students who were @entity80 or @entity81			1
the school system was based on sameness			1
we were treated as a mass of undifferentiated beings rather than individuals with diverse backgrounds and varying talents			0
it was only in 2013 that the national oath was abolished			1
but the ideology of sameness remains deeply - rooted			2
today , it is just as difficult as yesterday to be and to remain an individual in @entity5			1
it is harder for women			0
in @entity5 a woman is primarily seen as someone 's wife or someone 's daughter or someone 's mother			1
as a woman novelist , i am always treated as a woman first , then as a writer			0
for a male novelist it is the exact opposite			0
he is seen as a writer first and then people talk about his gender , if at all			0
one thing that makes me happy as a writer is to witness the diversity of my readers in @entity5 : conservatives , liberals , leftists , secularists , @entity121 , @entity74 , @entity122 , jews , @entity81 ... women with headscarves , women in miniskirts			2
but @entity5 's mainstream culture is deeply suspicious of " difference " -- be it cultural , ethnic or sexual			1
@entity5 society is stubbornly patriarchal and homophobic			1
the prime minister tells us that every @entity5 woman should have at least three children while the government talks about the need for creating a " new , pious @entity78 youth			1
" when identity is imposed from above , once again , individuality is in danger			0
this land , which once upon a time , was a multi-ethnic , multilingual and multi-religious empire , has turned itself into a nation - state where uniformity and authoritarianism are venerated at the expense of diversity and cosmopolitanism			0
@entity5 is filled with dynamism and potential for change but its adherence to sameness is stifling creativity and preventing it becoming a true and mature democracy			1
it is frustrating to see how little progress we have made over the years when it comes to improving our democracy , freedom of speech and women 's rights			1
we draw endless zigzags ; one step forward , one step back			0
and beneath the weight of sameness , @entity5 society is more polarized than ever			1
the gap between supporters of the prime minister 's @entity179 party and its opponents is so wide that no one even attempts to bridge it anymore			2
we are divided into ghettoes of the like - minded			0
glass walls surround us everywhere			0
we see each other but we neither listen nor talk , afraid and paranoid of the @entity187			0
as a result , the culture of coexistence , which was never profound in the first place , is eroding fast			2
there are only three areas left where people from different cultural and political backgrounds can still get together : art , literature and football			0
outside these spaces we are a badly divided society .			2

until 2013 , @entity5 children would chant a national oath at school , says @entity204
its *wording* made her query the place of separate and collective self in @entity5 , she writes
@entity204 says @entity5 's mainstream is suspicious of difference
but she says " sameness " is stifling creativity and democracy and causing divisions in society
