-- it 's played from the sun - soaked sands of the @entity4 to the mud - sodden playing - fields of @entity8 's most exclusive private schools			2
the game 's professional competitions attract a colorful core of hard - drinking supporters with a penchant for fancy dress ( think cowboy hats , togas and men dressed as nuns )			1
and come 2016 , this unique combination of sport and frock - wearing spectacle will be gracing @entity23 's @entity22			1
welcome to the wonderful world of rugby sevens , a combination of fast and furious on - field play augmented by no little fun in the stands in a nine - leg circuit which reaches its party peak in @entity32			1
although it may lack some of the more brutal hits perpetrated in its 15 - a - side cousin rugby union , sevens is quick , intense and just as technically demanding			1
the boisterous atmosphere that surrounds the sport , meanwhile , encourages fans of all ages to get involved and participate			2
" it 's as much about the party as it is about the matches themselves , " former @entity44 rugby union international @entity42 told @entity0 's @entity46 show			2
" everyone gets into the spirit of it , everyone has a great time but also , it 's a community and it 's just a great feel			2
" i must admit i have been in the @entity57 in @entity32 incognito , in fancy dress			1
we went toga one year and cowboys one year as well			0
if you like rugby , these are the things you have to tick off in life			0
" a rugby throwback for old hats like @entity42 , modern sevens is as close as it gets to the free - spirited days of rugby as an amateur sport			1
despite being hugely popular in the likes of the @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity44 , @entity75 and @entity76 for more than a century , rugby only went professional in the mid- 1990s			0
in the days before the pro era , teams would regularly tour and play against each other before drinking the bar dry together afterwards			0
while there may be more of an athletic focus on conditioning , diet and preparation these days , the globetrotting nature of the leading sevens competitions means teams travel together and regularly meet in far - flung regions of the world			0
@entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity32 are all destinations on the @entity95 , a traveling road show that exhibits the game to crowds in regions far outside of rugby 's traditional heartlands			1
" it 's a little bit of a throwback to rugby when i played , " @entity44 sevens coach @entity102 told @entity0			1
" you travel and stay in the same hotel as your opposition , you respect them off the field , but the games are quite ferocious on the field			0
i like that aspect of it			0
" see also : @entity115 rugby captain on @entity116 for @entity8 legends @entity117 and @entity118 -- both @entity120 winners in 2003 -- this competitive edge allied with the unmistakeable camaraderie makes sevens a great introduction for those who may be new to the wider sport			1
" the more people come to this , the more people are exposed to rugby , the bigger it gets , " explained @entity117			0
" it 's a broken down version of the 15s game , it 's very easy for spectators			2
" @entity136 , meanwhile , lauds the high skill levels and increasing intensity of a game which he believes has become just as tough as other rugby codes			0
" it 's short , it 's sharp , it 's intense , it 's pact , there 's space , there 's tries but increasingly so , there 's more physicality , " he enthused			0
" perhaps in the old days people looked down their nose in terms of sevens being a game of touch and pass -- now it 's just utterly ferocious			2
" aiming for gold while in the past , some of rugby 's leading young players would use sevens as a finishing school before making the step up to the 15 - a - side game , today it 's more common for aspiring players to stay in the sevens for longer			1
increased popularity has enabled the @entity95 to offer more lucrative and longer contracts to the sport 's biggest stars			2
the prospect of @entity22 participation , meanwhile , means sevens is now at the forefront of many a rugby player 's mind			1

" what we 're finding now with the @entity22 coming up , some of these players that left sevens to go to fifteens want to come back into sevens to try and go for a gold medal in @entity23 in 2016 , " @entity183 ceo @entity182 told @entity0			1
" some of the 15 stars will come back and play ( sevens ) but it is a specialist sport and they do have their own stars and great players , whether they be from the top sides of @entity75 across the women 's games , " he added			1
" i 'm sure during the @entity22 , some stars will be born			2
" for @entity136 , however , the magic of seven - a - side rugby is about more than just the prospect of @entity22 glory			1
this is the case for both players and fans , he believes , and is evidenced at events the world over			0
" it 's just a fantastic way to spend a weekend , " he enthused			0
" you 've got @entity75 sat next to @entity215 sat next to @entity216 sat next to @entity44 , they 're all enjoying each other 's company			0
" of course they 're passionate about their country winning , but at the end of the game they all get up and have a dance together , go for a hotdog and have a great time			0
