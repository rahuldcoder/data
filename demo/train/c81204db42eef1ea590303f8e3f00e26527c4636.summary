@entity0 -- the man named one month ago to head the troubled @entity3 announced wednesday he is dramatically shaking up the agency , which he readily acknowledged has been damaged by a controversial gun - trafficking operation			1
acting director @entity6 said after 30 days of studying @entity3 issues and staff he is instigating a major shuffle of @entity3 personnel but is not yet firing anyone			1
@entity6 vowed a thorough internal review of " all investigative processes			0
" @entity6 announced 11 high - level changes , including naming as his deputy @entity15 who has overseen the @entity17 office for the past six months following bitter internal controversy over a gun operation there			1
" these have been difficult times for everyone in @entity3 because of a case in a division , " @entity6 told reporters			1
he then quickly confirmed he was talking about the controversial " @entity26 " in @entity3 's @entity27 , which featured @entity3 agents allowing illegally purchased firearms to " walk " from @entity31 gun stores across the @entity33 border and into the hands of drug cartels			1
the plan was to trail the weapons to the cartels , but thousands of firearms were lost in the process			1
@entity6 also said he understood trust has been damaged within @entity3 and said it would take time to heal			1
" we 're going to have to rebuild trust , " he said , referring to the reputation of @entity3 from its own agents and from other law enforcement agencies			2
the issue blew up in december 2010 , when @entity49 agent @entity26 was murdered , and two guns at the crime scene were part of the " @entity26 " operation			2
" the continuing debate over who approved the operation and how soon top @entity57 officials knew of it is fueled in part by partisan politics			0
some @entity60 are clamoring for a special counsel to investigate whether attorney general @entity62 or any of his top political aides knew of the operation early on , and could have stopped it			0
read up on @entity62 's alleged role in the operation some @entity68 , meanwhile , point to a similar " gun - walking " operation run out of the @entity27 's sub-office in @entity70 that began in 2006 under the @entity72 administration called @entity26			1
some of the defendants in that case are still being prosecuted			0
@entity6 said he was confident there were no other operations which involved cases of " guns walking			0
" @entity6 sought to stay above the political fray			0
" i 'm a political appointee , but i 'm not a politician , " @entity6 told a dozen reporters at @entity3 headquarters in @entity0			2
@entity6 insisted he had no view on the @entity60 - led congressional investigation			2
he lumped the two @entity31 cases together and said the @entity3 now has a " heightened awareness of the tactic allowing gun - walking			1
" sen. @entity89 , @entity90 and the ranking member of the @entity92 , released a statement after @entity6 ' announcement saying , " the reassignments are positive , especially in the case of @entity97 who i hope can help lead this agency out of its troubles			0
" but , i caution that rearranging the chairs on the deck , wo n't make @entity26 go away			2
" @entity89 said he also questioned the timing of the announcement			0
" there is a lot of effort at the @entity57 to spin the fact that the attorney general was less than candid before the @entity110 , and what better way to make that go away than a bureaucratic shuffle , " @entity89 said in the statement @entity6 was named to the position by @entity62 30 days ago , when former acting director @entity117 , under fire , was ousted and given a job as an adviser at the @entity57			1
@entity6 said he plans to continue to wear two hats			0
he heads the @entity3 while also serving as @entity122 attorney for @entity123			1
he expressed confidence he can manage his time to serve in both capacities			0
the acting director sidestepped political issues but was clear in his caution to @entity130 not to slash the @entity3 budget because of the current controversy			1
" i hope that does not happen			0
we 'll be smart about what we ask for , " he said			0
@entity6 said he intended to refocus the @entity3 on its core mission of fighting violent crime and protecting the @entity122 public			1
he repeatedly said he would await the outcome of the ongoing congressional investigation of " @entity26 , " as well as the inspector general 's investigation before deciding whom to hold accountable			2
" what went wrong ? i do n't know what went wrong , " @entity6 said			0
" we 'll have to wait for those reports			0

@entity3 is *laboring* under the cloud of " @entity26 "
firearms from the @entity122 wound up in the hands of @entity33 drug cartels
the acting director concedes " these have been difficult times for everyone in @entity3 "
he announces a major shake - up , with 11 high - level changes
