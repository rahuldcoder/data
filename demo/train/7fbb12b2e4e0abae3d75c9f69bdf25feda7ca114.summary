-- @entity3 @entity2 giants @entity1 have confirmed @entity4 as their captain for the new season , with @entity7 named as vice-captain			1
@entity1 captain @entity9 will be hoping to lift more trophies for the @entity12 giants this season			1
the @entity15 midfielder was given the captain 's armband by @entity18 last season after @entity20 retired			1
however , the arrival of @entity22 from @entity23 seemed to suggest that @entity9 's place in the @entity1 team was no longer guaranteed , but new coach @entity26 has decided that his compatriot will indeed be one of the first names on his team sheet next season			1
" we have been observing his behavior on and off the field over the last four weeks and the influence he has on the club and on the squad , " explained @entity26 's assistant @entity34 on @entity1 's official web site			2
@entity22 must now fear for his place in the @entity1 team after being told he is only second - choice behind @entity9			2
and , since @entity26 has made it clear that he wanted to choose a captain who will play every week , @entity22 may have to spend much of his first season in @entity12 sitting on the substitutes ' bench			2
" he can not play in his best position in our system , " admitted @entity26			0
" that is where @entity9 plays			0
he could play on the right , but i have chosen @entity54 for there			0
every player is compared to his rivals and the coach makes the decisions			0
" meanwhile , @entity1 's @entity61 midfielder @entity60 has been declared fit to resume training after a summer spent battling tendonitis in his knee			1
@entity60 missed the pre-season @entity66 tournament involving @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 and is not likely to make saturday 's opening @entity2 home match against @entity71			0
but the @entity72 international , who was monday called into his country 's squad for the @entity78 qualifier with the @entity79 in @entity80 on august 12 , will be ready to train on wednesday ,			0
