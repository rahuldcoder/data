-- the @entity2 government is up against a wall			1
the inability to locate the more than 200 school girls abducted a month ago has embarrassed the government and forced president @entity7 to appeal for foreign help as @entity2 's five - year struggle with terrorist group @entity10 escalates			1
it does seem that @entity2 are caught in the difficult position of having to welcome the help and be deeply wary of it			1
on the one hand we know , from the evident helplessness of our government , that we 're at the point where we can not make any progress without the skills and knowledge and technology that @entity25 countries will bring to this battle			0
on the other hand , there are questions ( running the gamut of conspiracy theory to reasonable concern ) about @entity34 's motivations , and its track record			1
" i have my reservations , " says @entity36 , a retired @entity2 army major who served as press secretary to military president @entity38 in the late 1980s , and is now a vocal critic of the @entity2 military			2
" [ now ] this is a good time [ for the @entity34 ] to do what they 've always wanted to do , " @entity36 says			2
he 's referring to the @entity44 ( @entity44 ) , run by the @entity34 @entity45 , and established by president @entity46 in 2007			2
from early on @entity48 leaders opposed attempts to site @entity44 's headquarters in @entity48			0
on his first official trip to @entity53 as president in december 2007 , on the invitation of president @entity46 , @entity2 's president @entity51 made comments that were interpreted back home to mean that @entity2 was acceding to @entity34 's @entity44 - in - @entity48 push			1
outrage in @entity2 compelled the president to declare that he " did not agree that @entity44 should be based in @entity48			2
" " what we discussed with [ president ] @entity46 is that if they have something to do for @entity48 that has to do with peace and security , they should contribute			0
i told him that we @entity48 countries have our own plan to establish a joint military command in every sub-region ... " he said			0
@entity75 , @entity51 's spokesperson , says those comments displeased @entity34			2
" [ @entity77 ] openly repudiating the idea of @entity44 , @entity2 's relationship with the @entity34 on @entity51 's watch had started on a very bad note			1
it was a relationship that would remain at a less - than - inspiring note throughout his tenure , " @entity75 writes in his book , " @entity83 , " an account of the @entity51 administration			0
@entity2 are right to be wary of @entity34 's military intentions , with the cautionary tales of countries like @entity93 and @entity94			1
" this is a transactional relationship ; there 's nothing strategic about it , " said @entity95 , retired @entity94 general and one - time head of the country 's @entity98 , of @entity34 - @entity94 military relations , at a reporting seminar for journalists which i attended in @entity104 in 2011			2
he added that the cumulative value of @entity34 military assistance to @entity94 ( $ 20 billion at that time , he said ) paled into insignificance compared to @entity94 's losses from the war on terror --- which he put at not less than $ 68 billion			2
" @entity34 will not do it out of honest intentions , " he told me			0
" it 's a matter of giving you 10 naira and in the long run they will collect 50 naira , " he says			0
but he is pragmatic enough to realize that at this point @entity2 has got little choice in the matter			1
" if we had done what we were supposed to have done , things would n't have turned out like this , " he says			0
then again there 's the strong possibility that suggestions of the @entity34 turning @entity2 into another @entity93 or @entity94 are unfounded			1
anonymous @entity2 defense blogger , @entity135 , points out that @entity2 has long enjoyed significant levels of cooperation with the @entity34 , in terms of receiving donations of hardware and training			1
" the difference in this latest @entity34 effort is that the @entity34 are going to collaborate with @entity2 in the field --- an undisguised first , " he wrote in an email message to me			1
but even that field work , he says , will not involve " putting [ @entity34 ] soldiers on the ground to fight alongside @entity2 soldiers			1
" that will no doubt be comforting to many observers			0
but there 's obviously still a lot that needs to be clarified regarding the extent and mode of foreign help @entity2 will be getting			1
for now the solidarity mounts ; at the last count @entity34 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 had already thrown in offers of assistance			0
@entity2 will of course continue to be wary , and quick to bristle at any threats , real or imagined , to @entity2 's sovereignty			0
it does n't help that many @entity2 believe , on the strength of pessimistic @entity34 assessments of @entity2 's fate , that its inclinations towards their country are sinister			1
and @entity2 have been there before			0
shortly after @entity179 in october 1960 , @entity2 's @entity178 formally approved the terms of a controversial " @entity181 , " which the @entity2 public had come to believe would give the departing colonial power the right to set up military bases in @entity2			0
the protests that followed , led by student and labor groups , resulted in the speedy repeal of the agreement by the @entity191 barely a year - and - half later			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			0

more than 200 *schoolgirls* kidnapped in @entity2 on april *14* are still *missing*
the mass abduction has been *claimed* by militant @entity199 group @entity10
the @entity34 is among the countries that have offered to help @entity2 find the girls
@entity194 says @entity2 realize foreign help is needed but query @entity34 motives
