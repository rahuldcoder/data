-- in what comes as little surprise for a conservative group of justices who have increasingly sided with corporate @entity8 's interests , the @entity1 has just made it harder to form certain kinds of unions in @entity8			1
and the ruling may lead to future challenges for other unions down the road			0
the court ruled that home health care workers in @entity18 do not qualify fully as public employees , so they are n't required to contribute fees for a public sector employee union			1
the @entity22 v. @entity24 ruling highly criticized , but did not overturn , the precedent that many public sector workers can form unions and must pay certain union fees			1
but the groundwork for future challenges was laid			0
collective bargaining is at the heart of unions , the idea that instead of each employee individually negotiating for his or her wages alone â € ” facing off against better - positioned and resourced managers â € ” the employees join to " collectively bargain " for pay and other conditions			1
employees working together can get far more information , and a group of workers has far more bargaining power than one worker alone			2
unions raise wages of employees by roughly 20 % and raise total compensation ( including benefits ) by 28 % , even after union dues are factored into the equation			1
even nonunion workers benefit : workers in union - friendly states earn , on average , $ 120 more a week than workers in anti-union states			1
a high school graduate working in a field that is 25 % unionized earns 5 % more than similar workers in less unionized fields			0
when union density goes up , income equality goes down			0
" everyone in this country should have the freedom to join together and bargain collectively for fair wages , benefits and safe jobs , " said @entity69 , executive director of @entity70 , in response to the ruling			1
" unions are one of the last remaining checks on corporate power , so it 's no surprise that corporate - backed extreme special interests are attempting to effectively end unions as we know them			2
" under existing law , a workplace union is formed when a majority of the employees vote in favor			2
but the union is obligated to represent all workers , including the ones who voted no. in exchange for this service , a service with clear financial advantages for workers , unions are authorized to require all employees in the unit to pay their fair share of the union 's costs			1
in the past , the @entity1 agreed all this is perfectly fine , provided that unions only charge nonunion employees for the costs associated with collective bargaining and other services that will directly benefit them : the " fair share " fee			1
other union activity , including political lobbying and electoral work , must come from discretionary contributions			2
the case involves workers in @entity18 who provide in - home care to people living with disabilities			2
the lead plaintiff , @entity122 , provides essential and constant care to her disabled son , @entity125 @entity18 allows recipients of disability benefits to contract with anyone they choose , including family members , and have them modestly compensated for their work in providing care			2
and so @entity131 contracted with his mom to be his caregiver			0
@entity18 sets and pays wages for workers like @entity22 through @entity136 , which is why a state law considered them " public employees " for purposes of collective bargaining with the state			1
the collective bargaining agreement between the unions that represent these workers , mainly @entity145 and @entity146 , and the state of @entity18 includes a " fair share " provision â € ” so nonunion members must pay a union fee			1
notably , @entity122 is not a member of a unit that is represented by a union , but she sued over the " fair share " fee nonetheless			0
as @entity22 told @entity161 's @entity160 , " i object to my home being a union or workplace			2
" except her home is n't part of a union agreement			0
and as for objecting to being " a workplace , " one has to wonder whether @entity22 objects to being paid for her work			0
facts aside , the powerful anti-union organizations and donors behind this lawsuit argue that " fair share " fees to a public sector union are by definition political because the union is negotiating with the government as employer			1
in a ruling that seems narrowly tailored but carries broad implications , the court ruled in a 5 - 4 decision that the home health aides are only " partial public employees " and do n't have to pay			1
the danger here is that anti-union interests could try to pigeonhole other types of employees into this new @entity22 exception and start to chip away at the legal rights of other workers to form unions			1
this is the goal behind the @entity22 suit in the first place			0
the ruling may not be as broad as anti-union big - business interests had hoped , but they will use any inch to advance their miles - long agenda of destroying public - and private - sector unions in @entity8 , taking away wages and protections for hardworking @entity8 and removing any checks and balances on the power of big business			1
after all , this case really is n't about @entity122 or the well - being of workers			0
if that was the case , given how much unions improve wages and working conditions for @entity8 , then conservatives would be strong supporters			2
no , this case is about unraveling the power of public - sector and private - sector unions more broadly to stop them demanding decent wages and benefits for workers in the face of otherwise - unchecked corporate windfalls of power and money			1
corporations have a vested interest in political inequality			0
in an electoral system corrupted by money , unions plainly pose the biggest challenge to big - money donors on the right			0
in the 2012 elections , the oil industry titans @entity239 and @entity240 spent more than $ 412 million through individual contributions , pacs and shadowy outside organizations on conservative causes			0
they are by far the greatest financial influence in our money - driven political system			0
and yet , the top 10 unions in @entity8 spent a combined $ 153 million in 2012 , nowhere near equal to what the @entity251 spent			0
but they remain a thorn in their side , arguing for raising the minimum wage and green energy			0
if union membership shrinks , the power of unions to counterbalance big corporate money in elections also shrinks			0
which is why the @entity265 and other big right wing political donors are behind the @entity22 lawsuit			0
the @entity22 case is in line with the @entity272 ruling that gave corporations the same free speech rights as individual people , and the @entity277 ruling that eliminated the cap on overall individual political contributions			0
every day across @entity8 , firefighters and police and home health aides and nurses work hard to keep us healthy and safe			1
this decision is a dangerous step in the wrong direction of eroding the basic freedom of all workers to stand together to demand better wages and working conditions , which is good for their families , good for our communities and good for our economy			1
the only thing unions are n't good for is big business --- which is exactly why big business has co-opted the @entity1 to undermine unions .			2

@entity1 rules home health care workers not required to pay public sector union fees
@entity307 : unions raise wages , benefits for all employees , union and nonunion alike
@entity307 : powerful anti-union interests could use this to chip away at unions even more
@entity307 : the freedom of employees to work together for better conditions in danger
