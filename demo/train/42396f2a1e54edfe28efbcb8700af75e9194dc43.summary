-- " @entity1 , " @entity3 's reimagining of the 1978 tv series , stands as one of the most successful sci - fi franchises of the past decade			1
once the critically acclaimed show ended its run in 2009 , fan interest in more adventures did n't waver			2
unfortunately , the first spinoff , " @entity12 , " only lasted one season , but another potential series , " @entity1 : blood and @entity17 , " showed promise			1
now , more than two years since " @entity12 " ended , fans are finally able to see the pilot for " @entity20 " on @entity22 's @entity21 ( eight parts have been posted )			1
@entity0 spoke to executive producer @entity24 and actor @entity25 ( who stars as a younger version of @entity28 ' character , @entity29 ) about the new series			1
@entity0 : why @entity29 ? @entity24 : when posed with the opportunity of creating new stories in the " @entity1 " universe , i chose @entity29 because he remained the most mystifying character			1
there was his relentless hatred of the @entity38 , his equally unwavering commitment and loyalty to friendships -- even at the point of being at the expense of blood relations			2
there 's things about @entity29 that you got hints of in " @entity1 , " but there were a lot of questions that remained unanswered			1
@entity0 : do you see this as a show that is mostly for " @entity1 " fans or an entry point for new viewers ? @entity24 : once you call it " @entity1 " in any way , shape or form , you 're quite deliberately attempting to attract fans of the show			1
one of the regrets that we had about " @entity12 " is that we were so intent on carving it out for a new audience that in the marketing of it , we strayed too far away from its lineage			2
had we done it over again , i would call it " @entity1 : caprica			1
" at the same time , i firmly believe that if you never saw an episode of " @entity1 , " you could plop right into this thing and completely get it and enjoy it			1
@entity0 : was this ever seen as a " backdoor pilot , " where it might conceivably end up on tv ? @entity24 : it always originated as an online series			1
there was some confusion in the press when @entity3 was toying for a period of time , with possibly launching it on - air first			1
when they went back to the plan of launching it online , there was a backlash , like " ooh , @entity3 does n't pick up pilot			1
" that was ridiculous , as it was never intended to be that			2
the deeper answer is that anyone who 's worked with @entity3 knows , there 's no such thing as a finite , hardcore game plan when it comes to this stuff			1
" @entity12 " premiered on @entity108 , then went on air			2
the conversation is ongoing , and at a certain point , as a creator you have to step out of it			2
i do n't think it 's specific to @entity3			1
it 's the nature of genre storytelling when you have a variety of options to distribute it			2
at a certain point , as a creator , you 'll go crazy if you worry too much about it			0
@entity0 : is there a possibility for a season two ? @entity24 : like any premiere , we 're waiting for feedback			1
the context of success and failure is completely alien to me			0
i do n't know what constitutes a hit			0
if i had a show on television , i would n't know what constitutes a hit anymore			0
i do n't know what the criterion is for success			0
if it 's met , i suspect we 'll get into a conversation about more of them			0
if it 's not met , i 'm sure this will make a lovely dvd keepsake for someone			0
i am encouraged by the powers that be that they have very high expectations for this			0
the buzz about it is extremely strong and loud , and we would not be foolish to get our hopes up to anticipate future storytelling			0
@entity0 : @entity25 , what was it like stepping into a role created by someone like @entity28 ? @entity25 : in my eyes , @entity28 set the precedent			1
he was a great commander as @entity29			1
as an artist , we 're always looking to test ourselves in that respect			0
i was very delighted to have this opportunity			0
@entity0 : i heard you watched " @entity12 " once you got the role			0
what else did you do in preparation ? @entity25 : one of the furthest things from my mind was watching anything @entity178 had done as @entity29			1
he 's playing him at a much later stage , and you change so much in 20 years , i think you 're a completely different person			2
i did n't want anything that @entity178 did to sway my interpretation of the character			0
@entity0 : were there any adjustments you had to make , knowing this was 100 minutes divided into 10 parts ? @entity25 : the biggest adjustment i had to make was this was my first test of my @entity194 accent , so i had to get that as close to believable as possible			1
i feel like i did a good job overcoming that one			0
it is very suspenseful , and you can get 10 or 12 minutes of wonder before watching the next one			2
@entity0 : let 's say this gets picked up and they decide to do multiple seasons of it			0
is this the kind of role you see doing long - term ? @entity25 : 100 percent			1
i do n't think there 's one person who would like to see it get picked up any more than me			0
i fell in love with the project			0
i loved the style of work			0
it was my first leading @entity194 role			0
i had the most amazing time doing it			0
there is so much more that this young @entity29 can offer			1
this is the kind of age period where people start to find themselves			0
i think @entity29 needs to experience some highs and lows			2
i think we 've only touched the surface of his journey .			0
