-- @entity1 took the preemptive step this week of recalling nearly half a million vehicles because of issues with the active head - restraint function found in several makes and models			1
the problem is related to a " potentially faulty microcontroller ( that ) entered the supply chain after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in @entity13 caused a worldwide microcontroller shortage , " @entity1 said in a news release issued wednesday			2
because of such defective microcontrollers in some vehicles , the active head restraints -- which are supposed to automatically move forward during some rear - impact crashes , thereby helping prevent neck injuries -- are n't working properly			1
the @entity1 said it does n't know of any injuries or accidents tied to the issue			1
some 442,000 vehicles sold in the @entity25 are affected by the recall , as well as 25,000 in @entity27 , 10,000 in @entity28 and 12,000 elsewhere			0
makes and models affected by the recall are : -- 2011 to 2013 @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 midsize cars			0
-- 2011 to 2012 @entity36 suvs			0
-- 2011 to 2013 @entity37			0
the @entity1 's recall comes weeks after the company resisted the federal government 's attempt to make it recall vehicles over a potential fire hazard			2
@entity1 stated earlier this month that it would not comply with the demand to recall vehicles that , the government said , had a high risk of catching fire when struck from behind			1
but it reversed course on june 18 , hours before a government deadline			0
even then , the company still claimed the 2.7 million recalled vehicles -- 1993 to 2004 @entity53 and 2002 to 2007 @entity54 -- are safe			1
witness talks about fiery @entity57 crash			0
