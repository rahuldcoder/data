-- eight @entity2 soldiers died of overdoses involving heroin , morphine or other opiates during deployments in @entity8 in 2010 and 2011 , according to @entity10 investigative reports			1
the overdoses were revealed in documents detailing how the @entity10 investigated a total of 56 soldiers , including the eight who fell victim to overdoses , on suspicion of possessing , using or distributing heroin and other opiates			1
at the same time , heroin use apparently is on the rise in the @entity10 overall , as military statistics show that the number of soldiers testing positive for heroin has grown from 10 instances in fiscal year 2002 to 116 in fiscal year 2010			1
@entity10 officials did n't respond to repeated requests for comment on saturday			1
but records from the service 's @entity33 , obtained by the conservative legal group @entity35 , provided glimpses into how soldiers bought drugs from @entity8 juveniles , an @entity8 interpreter and in one case , an employee of a @entity44 contractor , who was eventually fired			2
the drug use is occurring in a country that is estimated to supply more than 90 % of the world 's opium , and the @entity51 insurgency is believed to be stockpiling the drug to finance their activities , according to a 2009 @entity56 study			1
while the records show some soldiers using heroin , much of the opiate abuse by @entity2 soldiers in @entity8 involves prescription drugs such @entity63 , the @entity10 documents show			1
@entity35 obtained the documents under the @entity65 and provided them to @entity0			0
spokesman col. @entity66 of the @entity67 , the @entity69 - led command in @entity8 , verified the documents to @entity0 on saturday			0
one fatal overdose occurred in june 2010 at @entity72 , after a soldier asked another soldier to buy black tar opium from a local @entity8 outside the base 's entry control point			2
the first soldier died after consuming the opium like chewing tobacco and smoking pieces of it in a cigarette , the documents show			2
the reports even show soldier lingo for the drug -- calling it " @entity8 dip " in one case where three soldiers were accused of using the opiate , the @entity10 investigative reports show			1
the @entity2 has 89,000 troops in @entity8			0
the @entity2 death toll since the september 11 , 2001 , attacks that triggered the war has risen to more than 1,850 , including 82 this year , according to the @entity2 @entity44 and @entity97			2
@entity98 , president of @entity35 , said his group was interested in soldiers ' drug use partly because the risk was present during the @entity103			0
" you never want to see news of soldiers dying of drug use in @entity8 , " @entity98 said			0
" our concern is , will the military treat this as the problem that it is , and are the families of the soldiers aware of the added risk in this drug - infested country ? " there is a dotted line between the uses			2
prescription abuse can easily veer into heroin drug use , " @entity98 added			0
" @entity8 is the capital of this opiate production and the temptation is great there and the opportunity for drug use all the more			0
" the group is concerned that " there has n't been enough public discussion , and we would encourage the leadership to discuss or talk about this issue more openly , " @entity98 said			0
in one case , a soldier bought heroin and the anti-anxiety drug xanax from five " local national juveniles at multiple locations on @entity138 , @entity8 , and consumed them , " one report states			0
soldiers also distributed heroin , @entity63 and other drugs among themselves , according to the reports			1
another soldier fatally overdosed in december 2010 after taking several drugs , including morphine and codeine , though the drugs were not prescribed for him , the @entity10 documents show			1
one female soldier broke into the @entity151 at @entity152 and stole expired prescription narcotics including morphine , @entity63 , @entity155 , fentanyl and lorazepam , the documents show			0
the investigative reports show soldiers using other drugs , including steroids and marijuana , and even hashish that was sold to @entity2 servicemen by the @entity165 and @entity166 personnel , the reports state			1
@entity0 's @entity169 and @entity170 contributed to this report .			0
