@entity1 -- " i am not a member of any organized political party , " @entity0 once joked			2
" i am a @entity5			0
" plenty has been written on the current fight for the soul of the @entity9			0
but as president @entity11 unofficially rings in the sixth year of his administration with tuesday 's @entity14 address , another intriguing struggle may be emerging -- between moderates and progressives on the @entity18 side			1
it 's not a divide on a par with the cavernous @entity23 divisions of @entity0 ' day			0
but it is taking on growing importance as @entity18 , frustrated with unyielding @entity1 gridlock on virtually every major issue , start to look past the current administration			0
more specifically , as @entity18 look toward the future , there 's sharp disagreement over whether to stick with a @entity33 - style centrist agenda or embrace the unabashed left - wing populism most notably personified by sen. @entity35 of @entity36 and @entity38 mayor @entity37			1
" we are seeing a split in the @entity18 between self - described progressives and the old guard , " @entity40 political scientist @entity39 told @entity2			2
" if you dig deep , you see that these are old dividing lines based on economics , region , and culture			0
" policy ramifications aside , more liberal democrats worry that a return to @entity33 - era centrism will deflate the party 's base			2
more moderate @entity18 fear a full embrace of @entity59 - style liberalism will herald a return to the party 's @entity63 - @entity62 era political wilderness			1
whichever side wins this fight , one thing is already clear : six years after flocking to the banner of @entity11 's " hope and change " candidacy , a lot of progressives are disappointed in the current @entity18 administration			1
" it 's a mixed legacy , " said @entity75 , head of the @entity76 , a @entity1 - based liberal group			2
" in some areas , like ending two wars , ( @entity11 's ) presidency has represented a return to some sanity			1
but on the core issue of corporate power and a government that fights for the little guy , this administration so far has had a lot of missed opportunities			1
" @entity92 's @entity91 problem among other things , @entity75 criticized @entity11 for going along with " watered down @entity95 reform " and " a @entity9 version of health care reform			1
" @entity98 , a 68 - year - old political activist from @entity99 , told @entity2 she is particularly disappointed with @entity11 's willingness to consider changes to @entity102 that could lead to a reduction in future benefits			1
" i feel betrayed , " said @entity98 , a member of @entity75 's organization and a volunteer for the @entity11 campaign group @entity107			1
@entity11 " was so enthusiastic and identified with saving these programs for people who really need them			1
he was extremely verbal about it			0
" @entity11 's a " great man , " @entity98 insisted			1
but he " turned his back on me and on all of the people that voted for him on that promise			0
" on the other side , the president and vice president of the centrist think tank @entity122 published an op - ed in @entity124 in december warning that @entity37 - and @entity127 - style liberalism would be " disastrous for @entity18			1
" 5 things about @entity38 's new mayor " while @entity38 think of their city as the center of the universe , the last time its mayor won a race for governor or senator -- let alone president -- was 1869 , " they wrote			0
and " what works in midnight - blue @entity36 ... has n't sold on a national level since ( @entity141 's election in ) 1960			2
" @entity127 : end ' too big to fail ' in another dig at @entity127 , they argued that plans to boost @entity102 benefits are " exhibit a of this populist political and economic fantasy			0
" one week later , @entity127 fired off a letter to the heads of six major banks , pushing them to disclose any contributions the banks may have made to think tanks			0
" shareholders have a right to know how corporate resources are spent , and , even more importantly , policymakers and the public should be aware of your contributions and evaluate the work of the think tanks accordingly , " she wrote			0
meanwhile , with @entity11 's last campaign now well behind him , several left - leaning groups that had previously kept quiet for the sake of the president 's re-election are now echoing @entity75 's criticism and bucking the administration on a number of issues			1
earlier this month , a coalition of 18 environmental organizations sent the @entity176 a letter warning that @entity11 's " all of the above " energy strategy -- one that embraces so - called " green energy " and more domestic extraction of traditional fossil fuels -- is unacceptable for those sounding the alarm about climate change			1
" an ' all of the above ' strategy is a compromise that future generations ca n't afford , " the letter declared			0
" it increases environmental injustice while it locks in the extraction of fossil fuels that will inevitably lead to a catastrophic climate future			0
" liberal groups made their displeasure clear last year when @entity11 considered @entity197 -- a key member of @entity33 's economic team -- to head the @entity199			1
@entity11 ultimately went with @entity200			1
a number of progressive leaders also pushed back against @entity11 's proposed airstrikes in @entity204 , and made clear their unhappiness with the recent budget deal that froze spending on key liberal domestic priorities			1
@entity11 , who originally emerged from the more liberal wing of the @entity18 , appears sympathetic at least to the economic populism arguments			1
in a speech in december to the left - leaning @entity212 , the president made clear that @entity214 's growing wealth disparity would be a focus of his remaining time in office			1
" increasing inequality is most pronounced in our country and it challenges the very essence of who we are as a people , " he declared			0
@entity11 says income gap eroding @entity214 dream while divided @entity18 will soon begin their search for a new standard - bearer , political observers warn not to make too much of the differences now bubbling to the surface			1
" both parties have a far greater degree of programmatic consensus than they did 40 or 50 years ago			0
this is one reason why the parties have polarized and why it is often difficult to achieve bipartisan compromises , " noted @entity234 political scientist @entity233			0
" the differences between @entity11 , @entity92 , @entity127 ( and others ) are mostly at the margins , " he argued			2
" there is far more agreement than disagreement on the fundamental issues			0
" @entity246 and the @entity247 : the ties that bind ? " by their nature , political parties are coalitions of mostly like - minded voters and groups , " @entity250 political scientist @entity249 added			2
" it 's not uncommon for there to be differences on policy issues within the coalition , or a range of opinions on issues that span part of the political spectrum			0
" regardless , @entity39 argued that the financial demands of modern presidential campaigns may ultimately spell defeat for @entity37 - and @entity127 - style economic populism			2
the political war over poverty " there is a strong voice within the @entity18 that believes @entity11 has not done enough to protect the average working voter , " she said			2
" for now @entity35 personifies that voice , but when the pressure to raise really big money for 2016 rears its ugly head ( and ) the @entity18 need to be competitive for @entity95 money , her voice may very well get drowned out by the pragmatic wing of the party			2
" @entity39 also noted that around the dawn of the last century , the @entity9 wrestled with a similar split on economic issues			0
the outcome of that struggle eventually helped fuel decades of dominance for @entity291 coalition			0
" history tells us that danger lurks for both the @entity18 and the @entity9 if they fail to heal their internal divisions , " she warned .			0

dems disagree over whether to stick with centrist agenda or embrace left - wing populism
@entity11 " so far has had a lot of missed opportunities , " progressive leader says
when 2016 rolls around , pragmatists might drown out *progessives* , *expert* says
