-- when the roaring stopped , when the debris stopped whirling and the glass stopped breaking , the 4 - foot wooden cross remained on the wall			1
it was a fixture in the emergency department waiting room of @entity9 's @entity8 in @entity10 , @entity11 , a symbol of the hospital 's @entity14 roots and , perhaps , a comfort to the sick and injured who sought help there			1
and after @entity9 's took a direct hit from a catastrophic tornado may 22 , it became a symbol of something else : @entity10 's resilience , the strength and compassion of its people and their determination to rebuild			1
on sunday , the cross will be loaded onto a truck bed and will lead the way from the old hospital to the site of a new facility during a dual demolition - groundbreaking ceremony			1
demolition of the old hospital building -- a reminder of the tragedy -- will begin , and ground will be broken for a new building as @entity10 moves forward			1
" it 's hard to say goodbye to the building that has been @entity9 's since 1968 , " said @entity41 , president of @entity42 , in a statement			1
the hospital has occupied three different sites in @entity10 since 1896			1
" but like the rest of the city , we are glad to be moving ahead and looking to the future			1
while we will never forget what happened here , taking down the hospital is another step in the process of removing the visible signs of the tornado 's devastation from the landscape , " @entity41 said			1
" as i drive by it , like everyone else , it reminds me of that horrible night that lives were changed in our community , " said @entity61 , a @entity10 city councilman			1
but , he said , the building is also " a testimony " to the past eight months " and how strong people have been , and how they 've pulled together			0
" " a lot of cleanup has been done , a lot of rebuilding is going on , " @entity61 said			0
but " people are still somewhat confused , and they 're going through , i think , a time of ' this happened			1
what do i do now ? ' i think that 's kind of where we are now			1
we 're trying to get over the shock of all of it			1
" the final death toll from the tornado was 161 -- including five patients and one visitor at @entity9 's			1
more than 1,000 people were injured			0
the @entity10 twister was the deadliest on @entity91 soil since the @entity92 began keeping records in 1950			1
it was classified as an @entity95 , the highest ranking on the scale used to measure tornado intensity , with winds of more than 200 mph			1
inside @entity9 's , on the corner of 26th and @entity102 in the southwestern part of the city , patients were watching television , resting , eating dinner or receiving visitors that sunday evening when the twister slammed into the nine - story building about 5:40 p.m. windows were blown out			1
cars were hurled in the parking lot like toys , piled near the emergency room entrance			0
gurneys were thrown blocks away			0
in parts of the hospital parking lot and in a parking lot just to the west , 200 - to 300 - pound concrete parking stops , fastened into the asphalt with rebar , were lifted and tossed up to 180 feet , the weather service said			1
the hospital 's helicopter lay crumpled , some distance away from its pad			1
x-rays from @entity9 's were found in driveways in @entity129 , @entity11 , about 70 miles away			1
the building looked as if it had been bombed			0
" the houses are all gone , " @entity131 , who was near the hospital when the storm struck , told @entity135 newspaper at the time			2
" the medical buildings are gone			0
( the hospital ) windows have all been blown out			2
i could n't even take pictures on my phone			0
" the hospital was very nearly the only structure in the immediate area left standing , albeit severely damaged			2
hospital officials swung into action almost immediately			2
about 183 patients and 200 staffers were evacuated from the building			0
triage centers were set up outside			0
other hospitals in the area opened their doors for @entity9 's patients and others who had been injured			1
doctors and nurses rushed to the scene			0
" within a matter of hours , we had almost more help than we could put to use , " dr. @entity161 told @entity0 at the time			0
" i just ca n't begin to tell you , we 've had people coming from several hundreds of miles away , grabbing their stethoscope and anything they could get , and threw it in the car and came			2
" across @entity10 , people were also pulling together			0
the injured were transported to hospitals on doors in the back of pickup trucks			0
businesses loaded trucks with donations			0
restaurants helped provide food to those in need			0
" you have shown the world what it means to love thy neighbor , " president @entity184 told the people of @entity10 at a memorial service for the victims a week after the tornado			2
" you 've banded together ... you 've demonstrated a simple truth : that amid heartbreak and tragedy , no one is a stranger			0
" that same day , @entity9 's was beginning to see patients in a tent facility set up across the parking lot			1
built to withstand 100 - mph winds , the facility had an emergency department , surgical suites , @entity206 and ct scan capabilities , a pharmacy and 60 inpatient beds , the hospital said			1
" the building is not @entity9 's , " dr. @entity210 , who worked to set up the temporary facility , said at the time			1
" @entity9 's is the people who worked in that building			1
and they 're going to be the people in this building			2
" a modular hospital has since taken the place of the tent , said @entity9 's spokeswoman @entity221 , and a more permanent structure was built nearby			1
the structure can be moved , and can be used to upgrade other facilities after @entity9 's moves into its new home , she said			1
in the days after the tornado , @entity42 was " a blessing , " @entity61 said			2
they continued paying their employees , he said , and set up the temporary facilities			0
" you have to admire that they did n't let it defeat them			0
" in all , five buildings across 47 acres at the hospital site will be demolished and cleared , according to a statement from @entity42 , @entity9 's parent company			1
its facility is by far the largest , at about 750,000 square feet			0
three medical offices and a rehabilitation facility will also be torn down			2
typically , a building so large would be imploded			0
but underground lead mines made that an impossibility for @entity9 's			1
" @entity10 traces its roots back to the early miners who settled here in the late 1800s , " said @entity246 , the demolition project manager , in the statement			0
" as is the case in many places throughout the city , those mines were filled in to make way for growth			2
while they can be made safe to build on , we do n't want to take any chances that demolition charges and crashing debris could create an uplift pressure that might cause damage to surrounding properties			0
" instead , a wrecking ball will demolish the hospital 's west tower , and grappling equipment will be used to take down the east tower			1
the demolition process should take about six weeks , officials said			0
but before it began , crews searched the hospital for anything in good condition -- bibles , artwork , memorial plaques , stained glass and marble			2
teams began cleaning out and salvaging in december , the hospital said			2
three time capsules were recovered -- one buried when the current hospital was built in 1968 , one when the east tower was completed in the 1980s and a third that marked @entity9 's 100th anniversary in @entity10 in 1996			1
and , of course , the cross			0
" the cross certainly has some scars on it , " said @entity291 , vice president of mission for @entity9 's , in the statement			1
" but they just add character			0
" many of the items recovered will either be relocated to the new hospital or placed in a tornado memorial museum , she said			1
other pieces -- plastic piping from the sprinkler system , windows -- will be studied and tested to see how they weathered the storm			0
meanwhile , officials are making efforts to limit the amount of debris that winds up in landfills from the demolition			0
steel , aluminum and copper from the buildings is being salvaged and recycled , hospital officials said			2
concrete and asphalt will be crushed into small pieces and used as backfill to ready the site for redevelopment			0
" the devastation from the tornado was bad enough , " said @entity325 , executive director of planning , design and construction for @entity42			2
" we really want to take all the measures possible to care for this site throughout the demolition process			0
" before the hospital comes down on sunday , a demolition ceremony will be held on the hospital campus , part of several events designed to help @entity10 " say goodbye to the past and celebrate the future , " @entity335 said			2
the @entity343 will transport the cross to the new hospital site , located about 2 1/2 miles away at @entity346 and @entity347			1
a groundbreaking ceremony will be held there , " a celebration of @entity42 's future and the rebuilding of @entity10 , " according to @entity42			2
@entity42 has invested nearly $ 1 billion to help rebuild @entity10 's health care complex , according to its website			2
" though the tornado took our hospital , it did not destroy our spirit , " the site says			1
" @entity42 is rising again in @entity10			0
" after the buildings are torn down , the land will be readied for development by @entity42			2
twelve acres have been donated to the @entity363 for a new elementary school that will replace two schools destroyed by the tornado ; construction is set to begin in may			0
options for the other acreage are being considered , @entity42 said			0
ideas under consideration include a memorial museum , a courtyard and a memorial garden			0
" the future is just so bright , " @entity61 said , as @entity10 's new hospital will be " one of the most up - to - date facilities in the country			1
" asked what the ceremonies might mean to @entity10 residents , he said , " maybe the word is ' hope			0
' " " to me , you can dwell on all the debris , or you can think about what 's going to rise up out of the debris , " @entity61 said			0
" i kind of have a tendency to want to concentrate on the future			0

@entity9 's @entity8 took a near - direct hit from an ef - 5 tornado in may
the hospital is being torn down and rebuilt about 2 miles away
the tornado was the deadliest ever on @entity91 soil
