-- @entity1 climbed to the top of the @entity3 with a 2 - 0 victory over @entity6 rivals @entity5 despite playing half of saturday 's clash with only 10 men			1
@entity10 's team moved a point above champions @entity12 , who host @entity14 on sunday , while @entity15 dropped to third ahead of their trip to @entity18			0
@entity20 's side can join @entity1 on 67 points with victory in that game			2
@entity25 's @entity5 team were left to rue a missed penalty as the defeat left them just three points above the relegation zone			1
@entity1 , who on friday were handed a chance to avenge 2006 's @entity33 final defeat by @entity34 in the upcoming quarterfinals , took the lead after just five minutes in the rain at the @entity38			2
@entity40 midfielder @entity39 fired in a low shot for his sixth goal this season , having dispossessed @entity44 and then played a neat one - two on the edge of the area with striker @entity47			0
but @entity1 could not turn their dominance into further goals , and @entity5 should have leveled just before halftime when @entity52 defender @entity51 was sent off as his nudge in the back of @entity55 saw the @entity57 striker tumble in the box			1
but @entity59 saw his penalty saved by @entity1 goalkeeper @entity61 , and the hosts also escaped in the second half when substitute striker @entity64 saw his fierce low shot hit the outside of the post			2
@entity1 captain @entity68 made the points safe on his return from injury five minutes after that with a penalty on 82 , as @entity75 defender @entity74 paid the price for deliberately blocking the @entity79 midfielder 's clever little flick with his arm			0
@entity81 consolidated fourth place with a hard - fought 2 - 1 victory at 10 - man @entity84 , as substitute @entity86 came off the bench to put the @entity6 club ahead before @entity89 was sent off and then helped set up @entity91 's 77th - minute winner			1
the on - loan @entity92 forward netted just 18 seconds after halftime having come on for @entity94 , who joined @entity75 striker @entity95 on the injured list after suffering a hamstring problem in the first half			0
@entity89 went three minutes later for his second booking , but @entity84 leveled on 64 as winger @entity100 scored from the penalty spot against his former club after fullback @entity103 fouled striker @entity104			0
@entity86 's dummy allowed @entity106 midfielder @entity91 to put the @entity107 four points clear of fifth - placed @entity14 , who will have played one more match after sunday 's trip to bitter @entity113 rivals @entity12			0
the victory was doubly important for @entity81 after fellow @entity33 hopefuls @entity116 had to come from behind to snatch a 2 - 2 draw with lowly @entity118 in the @entity120 derby earlier on saturday			1
@entity121 put @entity116 ahead in the 16th minute despite appearing to be offside , and the @entity123 striker salvaged a point for the hosts with eight minutes remaining as he steered @entity127 's low shot into the visitors ' net for his 13th league goal this season			0
wolves moved four points clear of the bottom three , but were denied a first win at @entity135 in 30 years despite @entity137 's bundled 23rd - minute equalizer and an own - goal from @entity75 international @entity139 seven minutes before halftime			0
the result left @entity116 in seventh , having played one less game than @entity81 , equal on 50 points with @entity145 , who travel to @entity147 on sunday			2
@entity148 moved above @entity149 into eighth place with a 2 - 0 win at home to @entity153 , who had @entity155 sent off in the 71st minute for bringing down @entity157 striker @entity156			1
@entity159 midfielder @entity158 fired in the resulting freekick and @entity162 international @entity161 wrapped up victory with a minute to go after @entity164 hit the crossbar			0
@entity149 crashed 3 - 1 at @entity166 , who eased their relegation worries as @entity75 @entity170 hopeful @entity169 scored twice in the first 11 minutes to take his @entity3 tally to 20 goals this season and 21 overall			1
@entity174 moved seven points clear of the bottom three with a 1 - 0 win over @entity177 , as @entity180 striker @entity179 's 90th - minute header left the visitors deep in relegation trouble after a 15th defeat in 16 away matches			1
@entity185 remain second from bottom , behind @entity177 on goal difference , as new manager @entity188 suffered a heartbreaking 3 - 2 defeat at basement club @entity190 in his match in charge			2
the visitors led 2 - 1 with 17 minutes to play after two goals from striker @entity195 , but @entity190 's on - loan midfielder @entity196 leveled in the 88th minute with a curled free - kick and the @entity199 veteran @entity198 netted a late winner			1
@entity190 are still set to be relegated after being docked nine points for going into administration , now 14 points from safety with eight games to play .			0

@entity1 climb to top of @entity3 with 2 - 0 victory over @entity6 rivals @entity5
