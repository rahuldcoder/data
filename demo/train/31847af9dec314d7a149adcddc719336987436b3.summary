@entity0 -- as @entity3 faces more scrutiny into allegations of phone hacking by its journalists , the spotlight has once again fallen on senior executive @entity8 who has been recalled to the parliamentary committee hearing			1
before the hacking scandal , @entity8 was widely regarded by media watchers as the heir apparent to his father 's powerful empire -- a remarkable turnaround for a college dropout once viewed as the family 's black sheep			1
as its deputy chief operating officer and head of international operations , @entity8 , 38 , is the third most senior figure at @entity3 , wielding considerable influence through the stable of newspaper titles at his command			1
but unless he can shrug off the turmoil that threatens to engulf the company , even after it stepped away from a controversial bid to acquire full control of its @entity35 - based broadcasting arm , his widely anticipated succession of @entity29 could be under threat			0
@entity8 's close links to the papers at the heart of the phone - hacking scandal could be pivotal			1
it was @entity8 who announced the closure of the @entity44 amid public fury about the paper 's tactics			1
he has always denied being aware of the phone - hacking activities -- although he did authorize payments to appease victims			0
but he is now being recalled to a @entity35 parliamentary investigation which is trying to establish the extent of illegal phone hacking by reporters working at the company 's titles			0
in evidence to an earlier hearing in july , @entity8 said he could not recall seeing a key document known as the " for @entity61 " e-mail			2
it implied that the practice was being conducted by more than one journalist , but this statement is directly contradicted by two of the company 's senior employees and may be the focus of fresh questioning			0
it is another intriguing chapter in a varied career to date			0
@entity8 , the third child from his father 's second marriage , once appeared to be the least likely of the media tycoon 's offspring to succeed , despite his evident intelligence			1
born in @entity0 , but raised in @entity78 , @entity8 went on to attend @entity79 , where he studied film and animation before dropping out in the mid- 1990s to help launch a hip - hop music label , @entity83			1
it was n't long before @entity8 was brought into the family business			2
@entity83 was eventually bought by @entity3 and in 1996 @entity8 was persuaded to take over the company 's nascent internet operations , with mixed results			1
by 2000 @entity8 was in charge of @entity3 's @entity91 satellite business , @entity92 , where he appeared to find his feet			1
in 2003 he took over its @entity35 - based sister operation , @entity95 , quickly dispelling doubts about his business acumen by meeting ambitious profit targets			0
@entity8 continued to rise through the ranks , taking on his @entity3 executive roles in 2007			1
at the time , @entity29 described his son as a " talented and proven executive with a rare blend of international perspective and deep hands - on experience			0
" his new position handed him overall control of @entity109 , an umbrella company that includes the @entity111 newspaper , the @entity112 and the defunct @entity44 -- the paper whose activities triggered the current @entity35 media crisis			0
although regularly cited as one of the most influential figures in @entity35 , @entity8 's political allegiances have never been clear			2
a 2007 profile in the @entity120 newspaper says @entity8 has been " unimpressed " by then opposition leader @entity121			2
@entity122 , meanwhile , described him as a " close confidant " of @entity121			0
@entity8 himself told the @entity112 in 2007 : " i do n't comment on politics			2
" @entity8 , who has two children with wife @entity127 , is said to be a black belt in karate			2
he is also proficient at corporate combat			0
in 2006 he steered @entity95 into the acquisition of a 17.9 % stake in @entity35 broadcaster @entity133 , blocking a rival move by @entity136			0
but it is his and @entity3 's plans to acquire full ownership of @entity95 that have put them on a collision course with @entity35 lawmakers in the wake of the phone hacking scandal , eventually deciding to back down under government pressure			1
media observers say it is too early to predict whether @entity8 can survive the scandal with his @entity3 prospects intact or will be edged out by contenders including older brother @entity151 or second - in - command @entity152			1
" obviously there is interest in the company 's main markets , @entity158 , the @entity159 and @entity35 and there will be repercussions affecting any officer of the company deemed to have oversight , " said @entity0 - based analyst @entity153 .			0

@entity8 , 38 , dropped out of @entity79 to start a hip - hop record label
@entity8 climbed ranks of @entity3 after taking charge of @entity170 in 2000
media observers say it 's too early to predict if scandal fallout will hurt @entity8
