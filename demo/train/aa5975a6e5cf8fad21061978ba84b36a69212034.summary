" it 's the desire to conceive a city through a common imagination , in which the public becomes an actor			0
" the remarkable amusement park is the brainchild of @entity58 , a street theater company famous for such creations as the 15 - meter spider that crawled through @entity61 , in @entity62 , as part of the city 's @entity66 celebrations in 2008			1
in 2007 , the $ 19 million @entity67 opened in the hope of regenerating @entity20 ' deserted dockyards , which had been in decay since closing in 1987			1
