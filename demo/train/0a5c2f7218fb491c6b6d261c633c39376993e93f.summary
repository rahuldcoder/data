-- with over 250 of the world 's leading galleries on show and in excess of 50,000 attendees , @entity1 can make a legitimate claim to being @entity9 's leading art fair			2
set against the city 's neon buzz , the annual four - day event -- which comes to a wrap on sunday -- is not just a big draw for the nation 's art - lovers , but a stampede of fashionistas , style spotters and unrepentant party - lovers alike			0
no surprise then that here , the blurred line between art and fashion fades into obscurity , with this year 's @entity1 taking their ever - incestuous mingling to new heights			1
for instance , @entity30 star @entity29 has designed a limited edition range of t - shirts and sandals to run alongside her exhibition and , in his @entity38 boutique , @entity36 exhibited five leather sculptures by @entity41 artist @entity40			0
meanwhile , @entity42 hosted a brunch to celebrate a limited edition collection of 45 t - shirts designed by artists like @entity47			1
and @entity48 hired @entity41 artisans to construct " @entity50 " — a beach house , originally designed by @entity53 architect @entity52 in 1934			0
they then shipped it to a beach in @entity38			0
" everyone in fashion is seeing @entity60 as an opportunity , " says @entity56 , the editor of @entity57 : @entity62 , the trends network at forecasting agency @entity64			1
" fashion brands are collaborating with artists more than ever			1
by being present at major international art fairs like @entity1 , brands get face time with a high concentration of high net - worths who are all here to buy art. " and shoes , sunglasses and handbags			0
@entity38 - based shoe brand @entity78 has launched a pop - up store in collaboration with @entity82			0
likewise @entity83 , the makers of eye wear for the jet - set , have released a range of sunglasses in @entity88 blue inspired by the artist 's archives			0
" it really is a brand fest here — all the major events are branded and there are tie - ups and collaborations for everything , " says @entity91 , who has been scouting art and design in @entity38 for several days			1
" it has become such a hotspot for luxury brands and the art crowd , " she added			1
handbags and history @entity60 is the most timely example of where art meets fashion , but the mingling of artists and designers is by no means a new phenomenon			1
back in the early 20th century , for instance , the @entity53 couturier @entity116 employed graphic artists such as @entity119 and @entity120 to create textile prints for his creations			1
between 1927 and 1954 , the @entity41 fashion designer @entity123 initiated the modern practice of collaborating with contemporary artists via her informal partnerships with @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129			1
@entity123 placed far less emphasis on the concept of ' collaboration ' -- a 21st - century label — and she did not prominently credit her artists as is common practice now			2
but the publicity this work received , particularly the ' lobster ' dress designed with @entity128 and later worn by @entity140 , set the trend for future collaborations between contemporary artists and fashion houses			1
the level of collaboration has always varied , and it still does today			0
at a basic level , a house may employ an artist for the purpose of decorating its staple products , such as leather goods , accessories and fabrics			0
in more involved collaborations , they may invite an artist to alter a product 's physical proportions , construction and style , or indeed imagine an entirely new product			2
but most collaborations merely involve a print that is sold or licensed for a negotiated price based on the status of the house and the size of the production , and then applied to the brand 's existing products			2
whatever the level of creative involvement on the part of the artist , such collaborations between art and fashion represent an important meeting of the two worlds			1
museums around the world have celebrated this and other important collaborations			1
in 2012 the @entity184 in @entity185 staged " impossible conversations , " an exhibition that featured @entity123 's work alongside that of contemporary @entity41 designer @entity189 , also known for her collaborations with visual artists			1
in 2010 , @entity193 in @entity185 recognized the modern - day proliferation of fashion -- art collaborations with " move ! " , a series of performances and installations by fourteen pairs of designers and artists , including @entity204 and @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207 , and @entity208 and @entity209			1
mutual benefit the modern fashion industry is intensely profit driven			2
the fact that so many collaborative projects come to market indicates that luxury brands regard these initiatives as commercially viable			2
collaboration with an artist almost always takes the form of a one - off capsule collection			0
from @entity224 's 2012 illustrations for @entity226 t - shirts and bags to @entity229 's recent collection of scarfs for @entity231 , limited edition collections have an aura of authenticity normally associated with works of art. fashion consumers also equate exclusivity with luxury , and nothing is so desired as that which has sold out			2
the reception of @entity244 's 2003 collection for @entity48 -- one of the house 's most commercially successful special projects to date -- indicates this desire from consumers for something ' extra '			0
this sense of added value makes them more collectable			0
" you 're not just buying @entity48 , " says @entity254			0
" you 're buying a collectable piece which is connected to a specific year and will go up in value when sold as vintage			0
" the incorporation of visual art into a fashion item also adds an of - the - moment relevance that is especially important for historic luxury brands			2
it can bring an additional gravitas to functional product lines such as leather goods			0
just as there is mutual benefit , there is also mutual risk			0
fashion houses must invest money in an experimental collection that may not resonate with consumers			1
and the artists who collaborate with them risk being branded ' sellouts ' by their colleagues in the art world			2
however , the potential for wider exposure is often worth the risk			1
there are also benefits for society at large			0
for many consumers , a collaborative fashion project is the their first introduction to a particular artist 's work			1
it comes in a digestible form that -- unlike contemporary art -- does not require a strictly defined body of knowledge			0
it is open to anyone with the means to buy the products or the willingness to explore them via the media			0
in this way fashion collaborations widen public access to contemporary art and give them a cultural education via the cash register			1
@entity312 at @entity60 or a @entity314 catwalk , long may it continue			1

@entity60 has become a fashion hotspot
fashion houses are keen to work with celebrated artists
collaborations help artists gain wider exposure to the mass market
