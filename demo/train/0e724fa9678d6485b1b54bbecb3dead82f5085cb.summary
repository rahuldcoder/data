ready or not @entity1 , @entity0 is the new girl next door			1
that 's how the 24 - year - old @entity5 - @entity4 woman sees herself , she explained to @entity7 's @entity6 on wednesday , three days after being crowned @entity1			1
" i have always viewed @entity1 as the girl next door , " @entity0 said			1
" but the girl next door is evolving , as the diversity of @entity1 evolves			1
she 's not who she was 10 years ago , and she 's not going to be the same person come 10 years down the road			0
" the fact that her win sunday spurred a torrent of racist reactions online -- many along the lines that she does n't represent what the @entity4 is -- did n't surprise @entity0			1
she 'd experienced it on a smaller scale when she became the first miss @entity21 of @entity5 descent			2
@entity0 sees it as her mission to tackle such stereotypes head on			2
it 's why the daughter of two @entity5 - born parents has a pageant platform of " celebrating diversity through cultural competence			2
" " i wanted to be the first @entity5 @entity1 , to be that symbol of a new face for the organization , " she said wednesday			1
" and to let younger girls know that regardless of race , their socioeconomic status , their religion that anyone can become not only @entity1 , but anything			2
" still , it would be understandable if @entity0 was taken aback by tweets claiming she was n't sufficiently @entity4 or was a terrorist			1
yet she 's been more heartened by all those that rallied around her			0
" for one negative tweet , i received dozens of positive tweets and support from not only @entity50 , but the @entity4 people across the country and ... the world for that matter , " the @entity52 , @entity21 , native said			0
" it 's been such an honor			0
" and while some criticize the pageant circuit for putting looks above all else , @entity0 said she 's thankful it helped her earn $ 25,000 in scholarships to study cognitive science at the @entity65			0
she will have another $ 60,000 to apply to her medical school tuition -- $ 50,000 from her @entity1 win and $ 10,000 from miss @entity21			1
this is all part of the more than $ 45 million in cash and scholarships the pageant organization gives out			0
yes , @entity0 admits , good looks are a part of the equation			0
contestants do strut around in swimsuits , after all , and they are judged as they walk in evening gowns			0
@entity0 says " that 's reality , " as is the 10 - minute interview with judges that people do n't see on tv			0
and @entity0 could n't be happier with the reality she 's now living -- as a groundbreaker , and a talking point , in a country addressing its cultural diversity			2
as she says : " i am living my @entity4 dream			1
" @entity1 , @entity90 and the beauty of choice opinion : a thank - you note to a new kind of @entity1			0

@entity0 , a first *generation* @entity5 , was crowned @entity1
some reacted on @entity100 by calling her not sufficiently @entity4 or a terrorist
she says her win shows how what *defines* " the girl next door " is evolving
" i am living my @entity4 dream , " @entity0 says
