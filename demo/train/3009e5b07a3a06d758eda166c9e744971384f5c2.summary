no. 2 @entity1 will square off against no. 4 @entity2 for the national championship on monday night			1
but this is n't like any other college football national title game from years ' past			2
this is the first one that will be decided through a playoff system			1
here is the what - you - need - to - know information about this game and how the teams got there			2
this game is historic for college football for the first time ever , the highest level of college football has a playoff system , something the fans and media have desired for years			1
this is the first year of the @entity29 , a four - team playoff that consists of two national semifinal games and a final			1
the top four seeds were , in order , @entity34 , @entity1 , @entity35 and @entity2			1
the teams were selected by a committee			0
the @entity29 , which replaces the @entity38 , runs for 12 years through the 2025 season			0
despite the change , the bowl - game structure is still in place			2
no. 2 @entity1 routed no. 3 @entity35 59 - 20 in the @entity44 in the first semifinal , while no. 4 @entity2 upset no. 1 @entity34 42 - 35 in the @entity48 , the second semifinal			1
@entity1 and @entity2 will play for the national championship at @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity52			1
there is other history to consider			0
coincidentally , the first time that men 's college basketball had a national championship game , back in 1939 , the two teams were @entity1 and @entity2			1
the @entity59 won that game against the @entity61 , 46 - 33 , on @entity63 's campus in @entity64 , @entity65			1
but with @entity1 's super-fast - paced offense -- and @entity2 's ability to go high tempo as well -- there is a chance the football game might have an even higher score			1
historic for tv , too @entity75 ponied up $ 7.3 billion -- that 's billion with a @entity76 -- for the rights to broadcast the @entity29 for 12 years			0
it 's an investment that already seems to be paying off , as the semifinals set records for cable tv			0
according to @entity75 , 28.2 million viewers tuned in to watch @entity1 defeat @entity35 in the @entity44			2
the @entity48 , in which @entity2 shocked @entity34 , attracted 28.3 million viewers			2
both of those games were the highest - rated shows in cable tv history			0
compared to last year , the @entity48 saw a 130 percent ratings ' increase , while the @entity44 increased by 45 percent			0
expect record - breaking numbers for @entity1 vs. @entity2			1
this game is such a big deal , cities are adjusting their names at least in @entity96 , anyway			0
the city of @entity1 , which is near @entity98 , announced it would be known as " @entity1 , @entity61 on the @entity99 , @entity100			2
" the new name is a play on the city 's " @entity1 on the @entity99 , @entity104 " slogan			1
additionally , @entity106 , @entity96 , elected a temporary name change , announcing on @entity108 it would drop the " a " and become " urban " in support of the @entity61 and their coach , @entity111			0
when asked for his reaction , @entity111 said , " wow			0
" it does n't appear that there are any name changes in the works in the state of @entity1 , but the fandom at times still borderlines on religious , particularly for the @entity59 ' star player , @entity122 - winning quarterback @entity121			1
earlier this season , a student from @entity124 in @entity125 informed @entity1 head coach @entity127 the talk around the school : " there 's @entity131 , there 's girls , and there 's @entity121			1
" @entity127 could n't help but laugh			0
" we 've got a poster in the works , " he joked			0
unlikely story : @entity122 winner vs. a third - string quarterback talk about different circumstances			1
@entity1 has been hovering around the top of the college rootball rankings all season , led by the quiet and calm @entity121			2
aside from an upset loss to @entity146 , @entity1 has been steady all season with @entity121 running the offense			2
this season , the junior has completed 68.6 % of his passes , throwing for 40 touchdowns and just three interceptions			0
meanwhile , @entity2 's season looked like it had ended before it even began			2
starting quarterback and @entity122 candidate @entity156 suffered a noncontact shoulder injury in practice in august and was out for the season			2
with little time to prepare , inexperienced backup quarterback @entity160 took over for the @entity61 , struggling in an early - season loss at home to then - unranked @entity164 in week 2			0
at that point , no one put @entity2 in the @entity29 conversation			0
ultimately , the struggles did n't last , as @entity160 ending up flourishing in @entity2 's offense , becoming a @entity122 contender himself			1
however , against rival @entity173 -- the @entity61 ' final game before the big ten championship game -- @entity160 suffered a broken ankle , ending his season			1
again , @entity2 looked to be finished , stuck on the outside of the @entity29 top four rankings			0
down to barely - used third - string quarterback @entity179 , @entity2 stunned the college football world , routing then - no. 13 @entity181 59 - 0 in the @entity183 championship game			1
it was @entity179 ' first career start			0
the win catapulted @entity2 into the @entity29			0
but @entity179 was n't done			0
the sophomore , who is nicknamed " @entity190 " because of his uniform number and arm strength , shocked fans again , leading the @entity61 to the upset win against @entity34 in the semifinals			0
this matchup never would have happened with the @entity38 it 's widely assumed that the old system , the @entity38 , would never have pitted @entity1 and @entity2 to play for a national championship			1
the @entity38 used human polls , computer rankings , and strength of schedule to match the top two teams in the country to play for the national title , and the process had always been open to criticism			0
with that formula , @entity2 would n't have had a chance , and @entity1 's hopes probably would have been slim			1
it 's likely that defending national champion @entity35 , who was undefeated in the regular season , would have played @entity214 champion @entity34 if the @entity38 was still in place .			2

monday 's national championship game first in new playoff system
it 's a matchup of @entity122 winner versus a third - string quarterback
@entity1 and @entity2 played in first men 's hoops championship
