@entity1 sen. @entity0 lost her @entity3 runoff race saturday night , felled by the red tide that 's swept the @entity5 and ties to an unpopular president that she could n't shake			1
@entity8 called the race for her @entity11 opponent rep. @entity10 a little over a half hour after the polls closed			1
republicans picked up nine @entity3 seats this election cycle and will have control of 54 seats in the chamber next year			1
once seen as @entity1 ' strongest incumbent , @entity0 ended up such a long - shot in her runoff with @entity10 that the @entity22 cut its investment in the state , a move that @entity0 decried as leaving " a soldier on the field			1
" in her concession speech , @entity0 touted her own " record of courage , honesty and integrity and delivering for the state when it mattered the most			0
" the senator also said she did n't regret her vote for @entity36 , which the @entity11 used to attack her and every other vulnerable @entity1 senator this cycle			1
" this is something to be proud of , and i 'm glad we fought for it , " she said , touting some of the benefits of the law			0
" shake it off , " @entity46 's pop anthem to moving past defeat and ignoring critics , played as @entity0 hugged the staff and family members gathered on the stage			1
and tears could be seen throughout the crowd as the event wound down on saturday night			1
an energetic @entity10 , meanwhile , opened his victory speech with a surprised , " whoa ! " he told his supporters his win was the " exclamation point " on the declaration that " we want our country to go in a conservative direction , " which was made with the @entity11 's resounding wins on nov. 4			1
he was introduced at his victory party by @entity11 sen. @entity66 , who endorsed the congressman and has been active in the race for him			1
and @entity10 was joined on stage by his onetime @entity11 foe in the race , retired @entity73 colonel @entity72 , who ran as a conservative alternative to him during the first round of voting but endorsed him in the runoff			1
@entity0 ran hard through the very end , insisting even saturday morning , outside the school where she cast her ballot , that there was still a shot			2
@entity0 , any @entity83 in @entity84 will remind you , had pulled off stunning upsets before			1
and a late - breaking controversy surrounding @entity10 's part - time work for @entity89 gave @entity1 some hope that they could damage him in the final moments of the race			2
but the controversy came too late to pick up much traction , despite @entity0 hammering him at campaign stops throughout the week on it			0
@entity0 's campaign pitch centered around her clout in the @entity3 , and what she can do for the state in @entity100			1
but that argument lost much of its potency on nov. 4 , when @entity1 lost the @entity3 and @entity0 could no longer tout a committee chairmanship			1
and @entity0 was never able to effectively localize the race and distance herself from the president , while @entity11 tied her to him at every opportunity			1
indeed , even @entity0 's supporters seemed to know it was over before @entity110			2
@entity111 , a supporter at the party , was visibly disappointed when told the race had been called for @entity10			0
but she admitted : " well , it was coming			0
" and @entity10 ran a largely error - free , if exceptionally safe , campaign			0
he held infrequent campaign stops during the runoff and stayed entirely out of the state for the final week of the runoff , returning only for a monday debate and two rallies friday			0
on saturday , he was taking a professional development course at the hospital where he works			0
but a troupe of volunteers were out saturday across the state canvassing for him			0
an army of @entity11 operatives descended on the runoff , many of whom came to the state after finishing top races elsewhere in the nation			2
the @entity135 had around 300 staffers in the state and used the runoff period as a testing ground for field and data methods			0
and @entity11 groups supporting @entity10 bombarded @entity0 with millions in attack ads , while a handful of small @entity1 groups spent less than half a million for her in the runoff			1
republicans wanted , they said , to put an " exclamation mark " on their wins on nov. 4			0
even @entity0 's deep familiarity with the state and family name could n't save her			2
@entity153 , the senator 's father , is a popular former mayor of @entity155 , and @entity156 , her brother , is the city 's current mayor			0
@entity0 canvassed the neighborhood surrounding her father 's home on satuday , much of which is home to low - income and @entity165 residents			2
she stopped at 66 - year - old @entity167 's house , just a few blocks away from her family 's , to shake hands and ask if she would be heading to the polls			0
@entity167 later said that of course she would , because she had known the senator for decades			0
" she 's a good person , and she 'd make a better senator than @entity10 , " she said			2
but despite her belief that @entity0 was the best candidate for the job , @entity167 acknowledged the odds were stacked against the senator			0
" it 's in @entity181 's hands now , " she said .			0

rep. @entity10 , a @entity11 , won @entity84 's runoff saturday night
he becomes the ninth @entity11 pickup in the @entity3 this election cycle
