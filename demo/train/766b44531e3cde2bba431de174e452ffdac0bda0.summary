-- @entity1 was one of those people who fixated on certain foods			1
he would eat the same thing voraciously for a few days , and then , when he tired of the same tastes , he moved onto something else			2
in august , when summer 's heat seemed unending in @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity1 took to savoring fried chicken -- and soft , sweet cantaloupe			1
beach was elderly -- 87 -- but after eating the fruit , his health declined rather suddenly and before anyone in his family knew what was wrong , he was dead			1
he is among 15 people who died from @entity19 in what the @entity20 is calling the deadliest @entity23 outbreak of a food - borne illness since 1998			2
gallery : the decade 's 10 biggest food - borne illness outbreaks the bacteria was traced to @entity30 cantaloupes grown at @entity32 ' fields in @entity33 , @entity34			1
as of monday , the outbreak had affected people in 19 states			2
the @entity20 first reported it publicly on september 12 , six days after @entity1 's family buried him			1
@entity40 ? what 's that ? beach and his wife @entity44 bought the tainted cantaloupe at a @entity47 grocery , where the store motto says : " the best is fresh			1
" a week after he ate the fruit , @entity1 felt malaise , perhaps not unusual for a man of 87 years			1
but then his face turned the shade of a tomato			2
soon he had trouble breathing and collapsed on the living room floor , according to a wrongful death lawsuit filed against @entity32			1
@entity44 heard him struggling to pull himself up off the floor			1
she hobbled into the room with her cane and saw her husband of 67 years unable to speak , unable to get up			2
she dialed 911 and an ambulance whisked @entity63 to @entity64 in nearby @entity65			2
he was discharged the next day but when he got worse at home , he returned to the hospital			2
one of @entity63 's six daughters , @entity69 met her father at the emergency room			2
@entity1 told her he did n't want @entity44 to see him this way			1
listeriosis causes fever , muscle aches , diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms			2
it is rarely a serious concern for healthy children and adults , according to the @entity20 , but it is particularly dangerous for pregnant women and the elderly or people with weakened immune systems			2
on the evening of september 1 , medical staff tried to intubate beach but he began hemorrhaging from the mouth and nose , the court documents said			2
soon after , he died			2
@entity44 never saw her husband alive again			0
two days after his funeral , an official from the @entity94 called @entity69			0
she was told then that her father had tested positive for @entity40			1
@entity69 's sister @entity96 said the family wondered why it took the hospital two days to release her father 's body			1
they had assumed he died of natural causes			0
" we knew it was some sort of infection , but we did not know what it was , " she said			1
but @entity40 ? she had never even heard that word before			1
what you need to know about @entity40 health officials began questioning @entity63 's daughters			1
what had he eaten in the weeks prior ? they specifically asked if he had consumed cantaloupes			0
@entity120 , meanwhile , glued herself to her computer , determined to learn more about the illness that killed her father			0
" doing all that reading , it became patently clear that the health departments knew there was an issue , " she said			2
" they knew there was a @entity40 problem			1
" the @entity135 's angst led to a lawsuit filed against @entity32			1
@entity120 said she hopes the lawsuit will help strengthen food safety laws			0
" it 's a terrible thing to lose someone you love to something that could be prevented , " she said			0
" i pray that it 's over			0
i hope nobody else has to lose a loved one			0
" battling the bacteria in @entity147 , @entity34 , @entity149 's parents , @entity150 and @entity151 , were getting ready to celebrate 60 years of marriage on september 8			1
they still had a good life together			0
despite his age -- 84 -- he felt spry enough to take the dogs out for a walk in their @entity147 neighborhood			0
he let @entity151 do most of the grocery shopping and cooking but he could make his own sandwiches for lunch			0
how to keep your food safe in early august , @entity151 came home from the nearby @entity169 market with half a @entity32 cantaloupe			1
she did n't buy the whole thing -- it was only the two of them			0
besides , she liked to able to see through the cellophane and decide if it was ripe enough			0
she and @entity150 both ate the lush fruit			0
@entity150 started to feel sick , just like @entity1			1
four days before @entity1 was rushed to hospital in @entity178 , @entity151 could n't get up from the toilet in @entity34			1
he had a fever of 103 degrees and felt nauseous			0
@entity151 called an ambulance which ferried her husband to @entity184			0
unlike the @entity135 , @entity151 ' daughters learned after a few days that their father was infected with @entity40			1
@entity149 , 55 , like @entity187 , went online to learn more about the bacteria that had sickened her father			2
health officials , after questioning @entity151 about what the couple had eaten in the last few weeks , determined that @entity193 was a part of the latest outbreak			1
after antibiotic therapy , @entity151 was transferred to a nursing home			0
@entity149 arrived on her parents anniversary with chocolate milkshakes in hand			0
but her father was n't feeling well			0
he was sent back to the hospital when his condition worsened			0
@entity151 eventually regained some of his strength			0
he was sent to a skilled nursing facility to recuperate on september 19 , the same day that the @entity206 announced it had found @entity19 in samples of @entity32 ' @entity30 cantaloupes			1
@entity151 ' @entity40 is gone but at that age , he will probably never return to the man he was , @entity149 said			1
a little bit of him went with his bout with the bacteria			1
he uses a walker now to move around ; all his body functions seem affected , @entity149 said			0
" i think it is amazing that he even survived , " she said			0
" i am surprised he is not one of those people who died			0
" the @entity151 are also suing @entity32 in hopes of recouping some of their medical costs			1
@entity149 , who loves cantaloupe , feels extremely lucky her family escaped tragedy			1
she , too , had bought some of the tainted fruit and received an automated phone call at home warning her about the recall			0
she , like @entity187 , thought she could trust what she was buying at the neighborhood grocery store			0
from now on , she will think twice			0
and fill her shopping cart with apples and oranges instead .			0

before his family knew what @entity40 was , @entity1 was dead
after eating @entity32 cantaloupe , @entity1 collapsed on the floor
in @entity34 , @entity193 is still recuperating from his bout with the bacteria
both families are suing @entity32
