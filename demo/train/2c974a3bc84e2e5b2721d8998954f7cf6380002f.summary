-- @entity2 excess is always an easy target , as the reception to last week 's " @entity6 " shows			2
but it 's worth remembering , simplicity is hard			1
the simplicity fused with moral force and emotional gravity that brothers @entity12 and @entity14 bring to @entity16 winner , " @entity17 , " is a rare and beautiful thing			1
the @entity20 siblings have forged an impressive foothold in the international cinema scene over the past 15 years or so , with a brand of rigorous , concerted neo-realist tales like " @entity25 , " " @entity26 " and " @entity27 " ( " @entity27 " ) that focus on marginalized , working class characters trapped by poverty and circumstance , but occasionally within spitting distance of something that can only be described as grace			0
as those titles suggest , children and parental bonds are a recurring theme , and they are paramount again in " @entity17			1
" twelve - year - old @entity39 ( @entity38 ) is a blonde urchin with a face that looks like it has already had too many tears squeezed out of it			1
when we first see him , he 's planning his escape from a children 's home			1
he 's desperate to get back home with his father , and refuses to believe it when they tell him the ne'er do well has taken off with no forwarding address			1
alas , when he does get away , the care - workers ' story checks out : their apartment is empty , even @entity39 's most prized possession , the bike his dad gave him , has gone			1
it 's at this moment , when the boy is trying to avoid recapture and deny the extent of his abandonment , that he runs headlong into the arms of a stranger , @entity67 ( @entity66 )			1
he clings on so tight that something clicks inside her , and she decides she can not let him go			0
over the following months , @entity67 brings @entity39 his beloved bike and persuades the authorities to allow the boy to visit with her on weekends			2
she 'll track down his father ( @entity75 ) , and insist they meet			2
( the spineless wretch wo n't even admit to the boy that his dad never wants to see him again			0
) she 'll even furnish a home for @entity39 , even though he 's scarcely capable of acknowledging his gratitude			1
still , the most severe tests of her love and compassion lie ahead			0
@entity66 is careful not to play a saint			0
in some ways @entity67 may be at the mercy of her resolution , it 's certainly a hard road she chooses			0
but then , how do you put a price on a sunny summer bike ride with a child who loves you like a mother ? speaking as a parent , " @entity17 " is sometimes almost unbearable to watch			2
not for the common cruelty of @entity39 's neglect so much as the @entity99 ' keen perception of his vulnerability to evil			1
he 's easy prey for an older teen , a youth who grants him privileges that no parent can compete with , and demands loyalty and self - sacrifice in return			0
it 's a straightforward moral schema , but a perennial story of innocence and corruption that resonates intimately with the world at large			2
and in this telling , it 's as compelling as any thriller			0
there is not a wasted shot in this stripped down , pared back fable			0
yet , it accrues a deep and lasting power			0
you wo n't see many better this year .			0

" @entity17 " has simplicity fused with moral force and emotional gravity
in the movie , @entity39 escapes a children 's home and is desperate to get back to his father
when he finds the apartment empty , he runs headlong into the arms of a stranger
