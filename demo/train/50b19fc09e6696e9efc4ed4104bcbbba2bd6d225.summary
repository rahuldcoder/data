-- there are certain moments of parental pride you know are coming : their first words , first steps , first date			0
and then there are the ones that blindside you			0
like this : the night before the @entity15 memorial service , my 13 - year - old son said , " @entity13 , i 'm going to wake up at 4 to watch the @entity15 memorial			1
" i was so proud that he was so inspired			0
he 's an all - star basketball player who mainlines @entity18			2
now he wanted to get up in the middle of the night to watch @entity0			0
and when president @entity21 spoke for our nation , i was grateful we 'd heard his remarks live			1
@entity21 captured president @entity15 's remarkable capacity to awaken activism			1
across oceans , across continents , across racial divides , across generations , @entity15 sparked what @entity31 described to the @entity34 people as " ripples of hope			1
" one of those ripples of hope inspired a skinny college kid with a funny name who 'd been more interested in rebounds than revolution			2
" over 30 years ago , " @entity21 said , " while still a student , i learned of @entity15 and the struggles taking place in this beautiful land , and it stirred something in me			1
it woke me up to my responsibilities to others and to myself , and it set me on an improbable journey that finds me here today			0
unlike our president , i was always interested in politics			2
( as an athlete , i was small but slow			0
) but at the @entity59 , something deeper happened			0
the @entity61 erected shanties on the @entity63			0
they challenged their fellow @entity65 to take responsibility for @entity59 's role in apartheid			2
the university 's endowment , flush with billions of petrodollars , invested in corporations that did business in @entity34			2
that meant my ridiculously cheap tuition was in some way subsidized by profits from propping up apartheid			0
i learned names like @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and of course , @entity15			1
most important , i learned , as the rev. @entity84 taught , that " injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere , " that we are all tied into " a seamless garment of destiny			0
" it was thrilling to be a part , however infinitesimal , of something larger than myself			0
even then , with my government on the side of apartheid , i knew we students were on the right side of history			1
i saved my " @entity102 " t - shirt all these years			0
this week , i dug it out and showed my sons			0
i told them about the anti-apartheid movement and how , years later , i joined president @entity107 in a @entity109 meeting with @entity15 , the prisoner - turned - president			1
we talked about the confidence that comes from knowing you 're on the right side of history			1
it is that same confidence that , i believe , was behind @entity21 's decision to shake the hand of @entity120 leader @entity119			1
@entity119 's brother , @entity121 , had been a steadfast supporter of @entity15 's @entity122 , even when the @entity123 was on the wrong side of history			1
and @entity15 never forgot a friend			1
that is not to excuse the horrendous human rights record of the @entity119 dictatorship			1
in his oppression , his censorship , his decades - long war on basic democratic rights , @entity130 was the @entity135			0
i believe @entity21 shook @entity119 's hand for the same reason @entity137 shook @entity138 's or @entity15 shook that of @entity140 , the last president of an apartheid @entity34 : because he knows he 's on the right side of history			1
years ago , i accompanied @entity107 to a meeting of the @entity145 in @entity146			0
moments before the president was to speak , i peeked out into the audience , gasped and sprinted back to @entity107 's holding room			1
" mr. president , " i said gravely , " @entity130 is on the front row			2
" no one had told us @entity119 would be there			2
" good , " he said			0
" maybe he 'll learn something			0
" @entity107 stood before @entity119 and the other assembled world leaders and spoke confidently of " a revolutionary idea : that freedom , freely elected governments , free markets , the free flow of ideas , the free movement of people ( are ) the surest route to the greatest prosperity for the largest number of people			2
" i doubt @entity121 actually learned much from @entity107 's speech			0
and i am not naive enough to believe @entity119 will emulate @entity15 simply because @entity21 shook his hand			1
but i do believe in the transformative , unpredictable power of sending out a ripple of hope from the right side of history			1
and i was thrilled that @entity21 's ripple of hope bobbed over a sleepy seventh - grader in the predawn darkness , watching the arc of the moral universe bend toward justice			1

the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 .			2

president @entity21 shook hands with @entity120 leader @entity119 at @entity15 's memorial
@entity188 : like @entity137 shaking @entity138 's hands , @entity21 's act makes sense
he says even a simple handshake can be *potent* and transformative
@entity199 : it sends out a ripple of hope from the right side of history
