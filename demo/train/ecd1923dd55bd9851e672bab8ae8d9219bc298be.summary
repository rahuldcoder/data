the attack revived painful memories of the 2008 terrorist siege in @entity53 , for which @entity4 blamed @entity3 - based extremists			1
@entity3 was quick to condemn the 2011 bombings of @entity53 while @entity0 was careful not to point the finger at @entity61			2
in 2004 , the nations agreed to negotiations that cover eight issues , including @entity37 , terrorism and @entity3 's concerns over river dams on the @entity4 side of the border , which it sees as a threat to its water supplies			0
since then , successive governments have held talks in an effort to end the historical acrimony			0
@entity10 and @entity2 hailed results from the dialogue in september 2008 as the countries completed four rounds of diplomatic meetings			1
but engagements were suspended two months later in november 2008 after the terrorist assault on @entity53 , which left more than 160 people dead			1
over the past two years , @entity4 and @entity3 have held a series of high - level meetings in their bid to put their peace dialogue back on track , a process considered crucial to regional stability ahead of the withdrawal of @entity94 troops from @entity95			0
in 2011 , @entity0 and @entity61 agreed to resume talks			0

prime minister @entity104 of @entity3 , who met @entity10 on the margins of a nuclear security summit in @entity107 , @entity108 , last month , also invited the @entity4 leader to his country			1
" @entity2 has chosen a visit to @entity17 as a reason to be in @entity0 , " @entity111 , @entity10 's former media adviser , wrote in a column for the @entity113 on friday			1
@entity111 suggested @entity10 " could choose a visit to his place of birth , the village @entity118 , as a good reason to go to @entity117 , and maybe even @entity61			2
" @entity10 was born in @entity118 during @entity34 rule over the subcontinent			0
today , the village is part of the @entity3 province of @entity128			0
gen. @entity129 was the last @entity3 president to visit @entity4 , in 2005 , upon invitation by @entity10 to watch a cricket match between the two countries			1
" nothing need come out of such visits			0
no joint statement , no agreements , no final solution			0
but each such visit and the ensuing dialogue will make it easier for both governments to walk down the road that @entity10 and @entity129 defined , " @entity111 wrote			2
other observers also said the sunday lunch meeting between the @entity4 and @entity3 leaders was encouraging			0
" the lunch being hosted by the prime minister for a @entity3 president on a private visit is a welcome step , " said @entity146 , a strategic analyst			1
