@entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 -- august in @entity2 means two things : vacation and wildfires			1
fires are popping up across the country at the tail end of a painful heatwave , but tourism is down sharply as many vacationers are concerned about visiting the country in its weak financial state			1
strong winds spread a substantial fire across the southern part of the @entity2 island of @entity1 late friday into saturday			1
no injuries have been reported and no homes have been damaged as of saturday afternoon , according to @entity1 police			1
the fire started at approximately 3 a.m. local time			2
many of the local residents suspect arson because the fire started in the middle of the night , but officials have not yet determined the cause			2
residents in @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , and @entity41 have either already evacuated their homes or are making preparations to do so			0
@entity38 and @entity39 are in the greatest danger from the fire , according to local firefighters			0
roads to both towns have been closed			0
police officials seemed overwhelmed by the scope of the fire , with several saying it was " everywhere " on the island and still not under control after many hours of firefighting efforts			1
the firefighting teams consist mostly of volunteers , but also include soldiers enlisted in the @entity2 army			0
in addition to fire trucks with water hoses , helicopters equipped with large buckets were being used to scoop up sea water to be dumped on the flames			0
the island is frequently plagued with fire in the summer months , mostly because of the combination of strong winds , and hot , dry weather , especially in august			2
another major factor is the mastiha and other dry trees that cover the hills of the island			0
@entity78 trees make a sap that is the primary export of the island , used to make liquor , candy , gums and beauty products sold in @entity2 and exported to other countries			0
the fire on the southern part of the island follows another one that started august 7 on the small island of @entity91 off the northern tip of @entity1			1
the island lost power for two days , according to residents , before the fire was contained			2
however , a huge portion of the mountains on the tiny island is now burned and blackened and local residents say more than 100 goats died in the fire			2
summer fires in @entity2 are a routine occurrence , but this year the country has bigger problems looming , including the pending bailout payments from the @entity108			0
on the island of @entity1 however , tourism is the more immediate issue worrying residents			1
tourism is down by about 50 % this summer , according to local reports			0
while the island of @entity1 is not as popular as @entity116 or @entity117 , it still relies heavily on the mostly @entity119 tourists who visit in july and august every year			1
the lack of foreign visitors is apparent on the southern part of @entity1			1
@entity124 beach , or " @entity126 " beach , is usually brimming with tourists and @entity2 visitors from the mainland during august , with the small road that leads up to the beach packed with rental cars and motor bikes			0
this year , the number of sunbathers on the beach appears to be down by more than half			0
@entity1 is off the coast of @entity139 in the eastern part of the @entity141 .			1
