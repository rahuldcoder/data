here on @entity1 , it 's easy to take things for granted			0
drinking a cup of coffee , for example , is a shockingly simple act when you 're affected by gravity , yet it 's infinitely more difficult once you leave @entity1 's atmosphere			1
in space you do n't sip , you suck , from a bag			2
that 's a good thing			0
the typical coffee cup simply does n't work in low gravity , unless you want scalding hot liquid floating through the air			1
it takes a special vessel to get liquid from an open container into an astronaut 's mouth			2
it also takes a helluva lot of science , as seen by the cup designed by @entity30 researchers			1
for the past year , scientists there have been developing a mug designed specifically to allow astronauts to sip on espresso ( or other warm and frothy drinks ) in low - gravity environments			1
the cup 's shape is odd — a little like a plastic baby boot — and was determined by mathematical models			2
every curve and geometric shape is designed to encourage the controlled movement of liquid			2
you 'll notice a pointed corner in the center of the cup ; this strange bit of design is what makes it possible to drink liquids in low gravity			1
the corner essentially acts like a wick , using surface tension to guide liquid toward your mouth			0
12 @entity60 as soon as an astronaut touches her mouth to the lip of the cup , a capillary connection is formed and the liquid travels up the vessel and forms sippable balls of coffee			2
it sounds simple enough , but designing a cup for space requires a deep understanding of how fluids move in low gravity			1
" we 're geeks , and we make spacecraft fluid systems , " says @entity76 , a professor of mechanical and mechanical engineering who is leading the research			0
" it 's like space plumbing			2
" on a day to day basis , this means @entity76 and his team solve problems like how to get rocket fuel to move on its own , or how to process urine using a device that has no moving parts			0
it turns out that all the data gleaned from capillary flow experiments aboard the @entity95 also is relevant in designing a low - gravity espresso cup			1
what cities would look like if @entity98 only by the @entity99 the project an evolution of @entity103 's low - gravity cup , which he designed on the @entity95 in 2008 as a means of drinking coffee in something approaching a normal fashion			1
it used the same principles employed by the espresso cup — an sharp interior corner angle that draws liquid upward — but was far less sustainable and scalable at that point			0
the @entity115 team began working on the problem after @entity117 announced it would send an espresso machine to the @entity95 later this year			0
no respectable espresso - drinking astronaut wants to sip brew out of a bag			0
the pleasure of drinking espresso comes from the inhaling the aroma and sipping the crema , the frothy , oily bubbles that sit at the top of your glass			0
that ca n't happen when you 're drinking from plastic bags			1
in a field where efficiency is priced above comfort , it 's fair to ask : who really needs an open - top cup ? but a reusable cup like this could actually be a boon for astronauts , especially now that the @entity95 has a 3 - d printer on board			1
21 awesomely well - designed products we 're dying to @entity147 once refined , @entity76 believes a design like this could save valuable volume and weight on a spacecraft destined for a long haul			2
that wo n't be for a while			0
the cups are still in the testing stage , and they cost $ 500 to @entity159 print in the transparent plastic			1
that 's not exactly cheap , but @entity76 believes it 's a relatively small price to pay when testing the same fluidic system theories would cost millions to test on rocket engines ( he suspects they 'll spend $ 100,000 before testing on the cup is complete )			1
" it 's a fast way to get a bunch of engineering and science data , " he says			0
" also it 's fun			0

researchers have @entity159 - printed a plastic cup that allows astronauts to drink coffee in space
because of low gravity , fluids ca n't be easily drank from open top containers when in orbit
the project is designed to test fluidic system theories at a *fraction* of the cost of *traditional* methods
