-- " @entity1 : reckoning " hopes to be the next big , addictive role - playing video game , and its creators are putting an emphasis on " big " with a wide - ranging environment and a deep story line			1
but did they take on more than they were prepared to do ? @entity10 studio general manager @entity9 was working in @entity11 and content with his lifestyle there when he got a call about working on " @entity15			0
" after seeing what the project and the people were all about , he decided to head east to @entity19 and join the team there			1
" this is a passionate and competitive group who want to take on @entity23 ( @entity24 ) , " @entity9 said			0
" this team stayed together despite being bought and sold by @entity26 and @entity27 before being bought by 38 studios			1
these people believe in what they are doing			0
" @entity9 said the new " reckoning " game contains more than 10 novels ' worth of back story from best - selling fantasy author @entity36 , 45,000 to 50,000 lines of dialogue , the artistic vision of @entity40 and the gaming vision of @entity42			1
but his team of 110 people was tasked with bringing all that creative energy to life			1
lead combat designer @entity47 , who worked on games for @entity49 and @entity50 ( @entity50 ) , said he was skeptical at first about whether the @entity10 team could make a game as big as it envisioned			1
" it started hitting its stride about the sixth month , in where it was ' we are making a huge game , and it 's going to be great , ' " @entity47 told @entity0			1
" once we all convinced ourselves that we were actually doing it , we stopped looking at if we could do things or not and just started building everything			0
" the goal , @entity47 said , was to make a fantastic role - playing game ( @entity62 ) that had a great action game built inside			2
he explained there were constant battles internally on balancing those two types of gaming while still presenting a cohesive story			2
" there 's this weird conglomerate of taking the best minds of the rpg group and taking the best minds of the action group and seeing how we could put those together , " he said			2
" the engine itself is a full - on action game , fighting game engine , but it 's also a full - on rpg game engine and puts all those hooks into each other			1
" if trying to design hundreds of weapons with different hit effects and back stories for combat was a challenge , trying to express 10,000 years of history in the game seemed nearly overwhelming for art director @entity90			1
he likened it to riding a bike down a hill			0
" you stop worrying about pedaling and just keep moving , " @entity90 said			0
" you just take each individual step as it 's coming and focus on ' we 're going to get this done , going to get this done			2
' " " there 's a depth there that you know walking in , you 're going to be building lots and lots of stuff , " he added			2
" @entity108 is our lead effects artist , and he 's fantastic			2
he and i would have conversations daily			0
how do we push this , yet try to find something that is familiar enough to people so they get it ? " @entity90 's artistic team had debates about what was going to be represented , how it would appear visually and whether it was even needed			1
eventually , the decisions came down to creating a huge , open world to appeal to gamers ' sense of exploration			1
" @entity36 ( @entity125 ) came up with a line that we 've repeated around here : ' if you want people to save the world , you have to give them a world worth saving			1
' for us , we wanted to put all that in there so that the players that really are @entity62 fanatics can see this is a real - deal rpg			2
and [ for ] the people that are action - game players , it is a real - deal action game			0
" both @entity90 and @entity47 admit they do n't know how deep the rabbit hole goes when talking about the depth of " @entity15			0
" " take the blue pill , " @entity90 said while laughing			0
" do n't even get me started on the quests , because there is so much lore , over 10 novels ' worth of writing , just in the game itself , " @entity47 added			1
" the dialogue is so huge			0
each person has so much that they 've contributed to this game that there is no way one person could fit it all in their head			0
" however , they were able to fit it all on one disk			0
" @entity1 : reckoning " is available for the @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166			1
it is rated m for mature because of blood and gore , intense violence and suggestive themes .			0
