@entity0 -- @entity6 government ministers secretly advised @entity7 on how to get convicted @entity9 bomber @entity8 released from a life sentence in a @entity12 prison , @entity3 documents published by @entity4 allege			1
a @entity14 official explained to the @entity7 how to apply for compassionate release for @entity8 after he was diagnosed with cancer , according to an october 2008 @entity3 embassy cable newly published by @entity4			1
the @entity6 government believed @entity12 would be inclined to grant the bomber compassionate release , the cable says			1
@entity8 , the only person convicted in the 1988 bombing of @entity9 , which killed 270 , was released in 2009			1
he is now living in @entity7			0
then - foreign office minister @entity23 wrote to @entity7 deputy foreign minister @entity24 in october 2008 to explain how to apply for compassionate release , a @entity6 official told the @entity25 in @entity0 , the cable says			2
the @entity14 in @entity0 and the office of @entity12 first minister @entity28 in @entity29 did not respond immediately to @entity1 requests for comment			1
the @entity6 government has always said it was not its decision whether or not to release @entity8 , but that of the @entity12 authorities because the bomber was imprisoned in @entity12			2
@entity12 has some control over its own affairs , including justice , but @entity0 runs @entity6 foreign policy			2
some @entity3 senators , led by @entity42 democrat @entity41 , have been furious about @entity8 's release			0
they said in a report in december that his medical condition did not justify setting him free			0
the leaked @entity3 embassy cable says @entity8 had been diagnosed with inoperable cancer and that the average life expectancy for someone with his condition was 18 months to two years			0
it noted that he could have as long as five years to live			0
the october 2008 @entity3 cable is broadly consistent with hundreds of documents about the case declassified by @entity12 after @entity8 was released in august 2009			1
those documents and @entity3 diplomatic cables published earlier by @entity4 show that @entity7 was determined to win the release of @entity8 , warning @entity0 that it would react badly if the bomber died in jail			0
the @entity6 have consistently denied that commercial considerations -- such as oil giant @entity62 's desire to drill in @entity7 -- played a role in @entity8 's release .			0
