-- it 's not the kind of view you want from the window seat : a damaged wing flap with a handwritten note on it saying " we know about this , " with an arrow pointing to the area in question			1
that 's what one passenger on a july 28 @entity17 flight from @entity18 , @entity19 , to @entity20 saw , snapping a photo of the rather unorthodox note that generated criticism on social media			1
on tuesday , @entity17 said that a wing flap on the @entity27 had received an @entity29 - approved trim repair before the flight and was safe to fly			1
" and before every flight , pilots do a walk around the plane , and they kept seeing the section repair and pointing it out and kept filing a report saying , ' you need to fix it , ' " said airline spokesman @entity30			1
maintenance workers wrote the note to head off further reports , which was " not the best approach , " @entity30 said			2
" it is not the best way to report an issue , and we have since removed the writing , and the flap will go in for a total repair in october			2
" the maintenance technician 's intentions were good , said another representative , @entity52			0
