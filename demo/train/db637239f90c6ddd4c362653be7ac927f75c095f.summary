-- critical water pipelines are breaking from coast to coast , triggered by this summer 's record high temperatures			1
it 's not a phenomenon or coincidence , experts say			1
it 's a clear sign that @entity9 should brace for more water interruptions , accompanied by skyrocketing water bills			1
the heat wave of the past few weeks has burst hundreds of crucial pipes in @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 , temporarily shutting off water to countless consumers just when they needed it most			1
" it 's one of the worst summers , " said @entity23 of @entity25 's @entity24			2
as days of 100 degree - plus temperatures bake the region , the utility reports 685 water main breaks since july alone			2
that 's an estimated rate of four times normal			1
to keep up with repairs , @entity23 said , workers have been putting in 12 - to 16 - hour shifts 24/7			0
" it 's the heat and the high water usage , " @entity23 said			1
high temperatures can dry soil so that it shrinks away from buried pipes			0
increased water usage raises pressure inside the water lines			2
both factors add strain to pipeline walls , making older pipes more susceptible to bursting			2
it underscores the fact that much of the nation 's underground water lines are 80 to 100 years old -- and approaching the end of their lives			1
experts call it @entity9 's " @entity59 , " when hundreds of water utilities nationwide will be forced to replace their aging infrastructure -- or suffer the consequences			1
who will probably have to pay for those hundreds of thousands of miles of new pipelines ? utility customers , industry experts say			1
water rates ranked for 50 cities for towns like @entity68 , @entity17 , population 1,150 , the situation reached emergency levels this week			2
a historic drought throughout @entity17 has left @entity68 with what mayor @entity71 described as " cracks so big in the ground , you could lose a small dog in them			0
" fourteen major water line breaks august 7 emptied water towers and forced @entity68 to shut off water service until tuesday , officials said			2
the mayor blamed the crisis on 80 - year - old pipelines and high demand as temperatures rose above 100 degrees for 37 straight days			1
@entity17 town turns off water , leaving residents boiling mad it 's even worse in the @entity17 town of @entity93			1
the hellish heat has left its entire reservoir dry as a bone			2
community leaders are considering trucking water in from elsewhere or laying a 12 - mile pipeline to connect to water in a nearby town			1
get ready for more of the same , environmentalists say			0
shifting climate change in the coming decades , they warn , will probably bring more droughts , record high temperatures and other weather conditions that will damage water infrastructure			1
@entity17 town threatened by dried - out reservoir options to ensure water for small towns like these are few and expensive , ranging from building larger reservoirs to connecting their water systems to utilities in nearby areas			1
" that kind of interconnection might be life - saving for that community , " said @entity119 of the @entity120			0
but the expense of laying miles of pipe may be too much for many utilities to handle			2
@entity128 turns sewer water into drinking water three facts hammer home the scary status of the nation 's water infrastructure : the nation averages about 700 water main breaks nationwide each day , according to the @entity137			1
@entity9 water utilities lose an average of about 10 % of their water -- worth $ 2.8 billion per year -- through leaks and other causes , according the @entity137			1
the @entity145 grades the water infrastructure at a @entity148 minus			1
" we 've gotten so good at capturing and transporting water that we 've really started to take it for granted , " said @entity149 , author of " @entity150 , " about the nation 's declining water infrastructure			1
" we had better start looking ahead and repairing our water infrastructure , because with the pressure from climate change , population growth , shifting demographics and the way we use water , the problem is only going to get worse rather than better			1
" skyrocketing water bills mystify , anger residents searching for answers with technology inside a control room in the nation 's capital , not far from the @entity172 , experts are hoping technology will solve this problem			1
the room is filled with multiple monitors displaying brightly colored graphs			0
" it looks like we should be launching rockets into space , " said @entity178 , general manager of @entity179			0
the room helps stand guard over the city 's 13,000 miles of water pipes and 42,000 valves			1
strategically placed sensors detect leaks ranging from a trickle to full - blown water main bursts			1
data about the breach are sent from these sensors to the control room , and technicians respond immediately			0
this allows the utility to more quickly and easily identify aging pipes and valves before they blow			0
" the highest cost we face is digging up the street on an emergency basis any time of day or night -- often overtime , " @entity178 said			0
the cost of replacing these aging systems is stunning			0
@entity178 recalls a major water main break last year along the @entity208 that flooded parts of buildings housing the @entity211 and @entity212			0
the burst pipe buckled @entity214 by about a foot and cost almost $ 1 million in repairs and restoration			1
smart water meters have slashed monthly meter readings from $ 3 per customer to just pennies			2
when these meters show a spike in customer 's water use , the utility sends an e-mail to alert customers that they may have a leak			2
the technology is credited with cutting water leaks from 36 percent to 22 percent , saving customers even more			0
" @entity232 hit " the @entity59 is going to be expensive			0
the @entity137 estimated that between 2007 and 2027 , drinking water utilities will have to invest $ 334 billion on new infrastructure			1
the problem is worsened by the timing of it all			0
there 's budget - cutting talk at the local , state and federal level			0
@entity178 called it a " quadruple hit			0
" " i do n't see that there 's any way , other than rate increases for most cities given the size of the financial need , " @entity178 said			1
" if we 're not able in parallel to demonstrate how we 're efficiently using the dollars we 're collecting , i think this industry is in for huge challenges with our customers			0
" water officials in @entity256 are considering raising rates more than 13 % for infrastructure improvements			2
in @entity260 , authorities increased water fees for the same reason			0
leaders in @entity264 took similar action			0
" with this increase , we can either stop drinking water , stop showering , stop doing the laundry or get out of the city , " complained a reader on @entity0 affiliate @entity268 's website			2
" the mayor and @entity274 need to realize that we along with other homeowners are the tax base , and if we leave , they 're up the creek ! " in @entity14 , @entity279 water officials are thinking about raising rates to replace thousands of miles of decaying water pipes			1
the city of @entity283 is trying something different			0
hoping to save yearly operating costs by combining utilities , the city shifted control of its water and sewer system to a not - for - profit trust that also runs the local natural gas			2
it will free up $ 425 million in city funds that could be used for other expenses			0
" taxpayers have been unwilling to look at the long - term , " @entity149 said			0
" but taxes and water rates go to maintaining this very important infrastructure that we take for granted , and if you 're not willing to pay those fees and taxes , then you 'll eventually suffer the consequences			1
" national water dialogue those consequences , some warn , include shifting weather patterns due to global climate change			0
hotter summers and fluctuating water levels in lakes and oceans due to climate change will damage water and sewer systems in the coming decades , according to a new report from the @entity320			0
" i 'm not hearing any outrage , " @entity149 said			0
" i kind of feel like the crazy person on the roof yelling and shouting and saying , ' hey , everybody we 've got to wake up and pay attention to this , ' especially when it comes to our dams and levees			0
" in a year that has seen historic flooding in several @entity334 and @entity14 states along the @entity336 and @entity337 rivers , @entity149 says , he thought the levee failures during @entity339 would have prompted more alarm about flood defenses			2
" more than 100 levees are at risk of catastrophic failure , " he said			0
" and this is from the @entity346			0
" @entity347 fears that @entity9 water issues are so threatening , sweeping policy changes are needed			1
he 's calling for a national dialogue focusing on water infrastructure issues			1
" we have no single federal office that 's overseeing the nation 's water supply , " @entity149 said			2
" there are n't really any easy answers to this , but these are issues that we have to tackle			0

heat wave blamed for water pipeline bursts from @entity14 to @entity20
experts : it 's a sign that sweeping replacement is needed for @entity9 water pipelines
cost of new water infrastructure $ 334 billion through 2027 , @entity137 says
many @entity9 utilities are already *requesting* rate increases to pay for new pipelines
