-- for capt. @entity2 , a doctor , and 2nd lt. @entity4 , a dentist , this is a hill worth fighting for			0
@entity4 , left , and @entity2 are set to report for duty in the @entity6 in july			1
these two @entity8 military recruits of the @entity10 faith are challenging an @entity6 order that they remove their turbans and cut their unshorn hair and beards when they report for active duty in july			1
in @entity18 , which originated in northwestern @entity19 , the turban and unshorn hair are articles of faith and ca n't be removed			2
but the @entity8 military says there are times when the military can not accommodate certain religious practices , " such as when those religious observations would interfere with the wear of proper military headgear or protective clothing or equipment			1
" " it does n't make sense to me , especially in these hard times , " @entity2 told @entity0			0
" the military is hurting for professionals			0
they need doctors , they need nurses			0
" aided by the @entity40 , a national civil rights group , and a law firm , the men have filed requests that their religious needs be accommodated			2
they have filed appeals with their immediate superiors and complaints with the inspectors general of the army and the @entity49			0
the @entity40 said @entity2 and @entity4 had been assured that when they were recruited to join the @entity6 's @entity50 that their unshorn hair and turbans " would not be a problem			1
" " both men were both recruited and commissioned -- with their @entity10 articles of faith -- during their respective first years of medical and dental school ( 2001 and 2006 ) through the @entity6 's @entity57			1
" both are concluding their training and are slated to begin active duty in july 2009			2
however , the @entity6 is now disputing their ability to serve with their @entity10 identity intact , " the @entity40 said in an april 14 letter addressed to defense secretary @entity62			1
@entity65 , the head of the @entity40 , told @entity0 that the issue at hand involves observant @entity10 , not those @entity10 - @entity8 who entered the military after removing their turbans and shaving their beards and hair			1
the issue is all - important for the roughly 500,000 - strong @entity8 @entity10 community , which faced hostility after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks , when people associated them with @entity78 terrorists because their turbans and beards resembled the militants ' appearance			1
" the perception is still there , " said @entity65			0
" we 're sort of still feeling it			0
" he said surveys -- including one done recently in @entity89 , @entity90 , where children reported being on the receiving end of verbal and physical abuse -- chronicle the problems @entity10 face			2
" these kids are being harassed in @entity90			0
it 's @entity89 , the most diverse county in the @entity8			0
if this is happening in @entity89 , it 's happening in other parts of the country			0
" so , he said , the opportunity to serve in the @entity6 sends the opposite message -- " that we are part and parcel of the fabric of this country			2
" @entity2 , @entity65 and the @entity10 community stress the @entity10 ' military heritage			2
@entity2 , for example , is the fourth generation in his family to serve in the military , and his ancestors served in @entity19 's military			0
the @entity10 served in allied forces in the two world wars and they serve in the militaries of @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , as well as @entity19			0
the coalition notes in its letter to @entity62 that a @entity10 doctor and dentist were serving in the @entity6 , " grandfathered in under the old policy " that ended in the 1980s when observant @entity10 were barred from admission to the armed forces			1
lt. col. @entity132 , an @entity6 spokesman , told @entity0 in an e-mail that " the @entity6 places high value on the rights of soldiers to freely observe the tenets of their respective religions			0
" " accommodation of a soldier 's religious practices must be examined against military necessity and can not be guaranteed at all times , " he wrote			1
" there are times when the @entity6 can not accommodate for religious reasons , such as when those religious observations would interfere with the wear of proper military headgear or protective clothing or equipment			1
" the @entity6 regulations which establish the standards of wear and appearance of the uniform and accommodating religious practices are in accordance with the @entity160 on this subject , " he said			1
but the @entity10 want the @entity6 to rethink and reconsider their situation			1
" if they can come up with another policy that would allow @entity10 to serve , i guarantee you , they will have many , many people join from the @entity10 community , " @entity2 said .			0
