-- many boxers have aspired to be the next @entity2 , but only one man was born to be			1
his dad is an icon , a tiny man who cast a huge shadow			0
a man who lifted the entire nation of @entity8 with his hands			0
and despite his 46 victories without a defeat , @entity10 still has to answer the questions about his famous father , still has to punch through the skepticism , still has to face opponents who he says underestimate him because just they do n't think he 's as good as his dad			1
" i ca n't help that people say that stuff about me			0
i am the son , and that is who i am , " the 26 - year - old said last week			0
" he is my dad , but little by little , i have proven myself			0
i have proven it in the ring			0
" the man he fights saturday night in @entity25 is another doubter			1
but he 's more than that : he 's terribly angry that his title was taken away and that of all people , the younger @entity10 was the one who got it			1
@entity31 thinks it is a joke that @entity10 is the @entity33 middleweight champion			1
he does n't believe that @entity10 has the skills			1
it was his name that won him a belt			2
looking back at ' latino in @entity39 ' : @entity41 boxer fights to inspire " the only reason he is world champion is because he is @entity10 , the son of the legend , " said @entity31 , who is 49 - 2 - 2 and considered the third best fighter in the world , regardless of weight division			1
he will easily be @entity2 's most difficult opponent , and long - time boxing announcer @entity48 of @entity49 , which will show the fight on pay - per - view , sees it as an intriguing match of opposites			1
where @entity10 is bigger and has often employed a simple , direct fight plan , @entity31 moves quickly , is a cerebral boxer who thoroughly studies his opponent			1
even at age 37 , he will wear a foe down with superior conditioning			0
" @entity31 is a matador of the highest order , and @entity10 is a bull of the highest order , " @entity48 said			1
one thing that helps @entity10 , @entity48 said , is that he has a great chin -- that is , the ability to take a strong punch to the head -- like his father			1
experts ' predictions for @entity10 - @entity31 unlike his father , though , @entity10 did n't grow up poor			1
boxing was n't a way out and a way up			2
it was a way to impress his father , whom @entity10 calls his idol			1
@entity79 was always around boxing			2
he 'd go to his father 's workouts , even when he was very young			2
@entity2 won his first 87 fights , taking titles in three weight divisions			1
he ended his career with a record of 107 - 6 - 2 , including 15 victories over men who were or would become champions			0
@entity91 ranked him as the 24th best boxer of all time , and the @entity94 said in 2002 that he was among the top 20 fighters during the magazine 's 80 years of publication			1
but to young @entity10 , he was also a drunk and drug addict who was often hard to live with while growing up			2
it was the son who took the boxing legend to rehab			2
the struggling father disowned his son but later thanked him			2
" i would have died , " the elder @entity10 told @entity49 for the documentary series " 24/7			2
" ( @entity49 , like @entity0 , is owned by @entity104			0
) today , the father is a businessman with restaurants and car dealerships and an energy drink			2
but as his son 's fight with @entity31 approaches , the legendary fighter is a very interested observer and anxious teacher			1
one evening , as night owl @entity10 emerges from his slumber , the father tries to give the begrudging student a lesson on how to box @entity31 , who will seek to constantly move just outside @entity10 's reach			1
the son looks disinterested and then jumps into the pool as his father continues to shadowbox and shout advice			0
later , the son sets up a spontaneous training session at the rental house where he is staying before the fight instead of going to the gym			0
it 's nights like this that anger his trainer , himself a legend in boxing for having coached more than 30 world champions			1
but none of them keeps a schedule like @entity10 , @entity138 said			2
the boxer trains where he wants to			0
at the gym , at the house , even outside at a cookout			0
he sleeps through most hours of daylight and then gets up and figures out whether he is going to meet @entity138 for a workout			0
sometimes , he does n't even go to the gym until 2 a.m. sometimes , he does n't go at all , calling @entity138 , who has waited hours , and telling him his body is n't up to it today			0
it frustrates the coach , who also trains @entity154 , among others			0
" it 's ok , as long as we get the work done , " he said			0
@entity48 , who will call saturday 's fight , said @entity10 has improved greatly since inviting @entity138 into his corner			1
" he has a far greater sense of where to be and when to be somewhere in the ring , " @entity48 said			0
" he moves with much greater fluidity			0
he can set things up			0
he used to just walk in and fire punches			0
now he does more to set up his punches , particularly the left hook to the body			0
" just like his old man			0
@entity138 admitted he 's had work to do with the young prospect			0
" he has the instincts of a fighter ; he 's just not a natural fighter like his father was , " @entity138 said			2
it is certain that @entity31 , who came to the sport very late at age 20 , does n't think @entity10 is the fighter his father was			1
during a dual interview with boxing analyst @entity182 , @entity31 glared at @entity10 and said , " you 're living in a delusion , based on your legendary father			1
when are you going to stop believing that ? " to which @entity10 retorted , " i will never stop being my father 's son			1
" but for @entity10 to stop being just a son of legend and start on the path to becoming a legend himself , he 'll have to beat @entity31 on saturday .			1
