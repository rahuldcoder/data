starting a company can feel like a lonely business			0
but for a little more than $ 100 a month , @entity3 resident @entity2 can develop his start - up , network with like - minded people and relax with a game of ping - pong -- all under the same roof			2
he is one of a growing number of go - it - alone entrepreneurs and freelancers in @entity13 leaving their apartments and cafes , and settling into " co-working " spaces			1
at these shared offices , they get to work in what is usually a laid - back but professional environment			2
however , almost just as important for these nomadic workers are the social and emotional benefits of mingling with their own kind			0
" coming here , you can feel supported by other people working on their businesses and feel less alone , " said @entity2 , who goes to the co-working space @entity27 , where he works on his @entity29 start - up , wholedaybuy.com			1
but @entity2 says not to underestimate the practical advantages of having actual office space in @entity3 , where high rent makes a permanent office out of reach for many who are just starting out			0
" if you want to meet a client , you want to have the space			0
it 's a physical location to gather people , " he says			2
thought to have first started in @entity46 in 2005 with @entity47 , co-working spaces are now widespread in the @entity48 and @entity49 and are making headway in @entity13 , courting mostly people in their 20s and 30s working on projects solo or in small teams			1
there are now dozens of such places in @entity57 , and a handful have opened in @entity59 and @entity3			2
the congested cities seem ready - made for co-working , with cramped apartments that could make working from home unpleasant -- and unimpressive for investors or clients			1
and going it alone is just starting to catch on in @entity13 , where people traditionally strive to work for large corporations			1
" it 's only becoming acceptable to take the risk of starting tech start - ups or being a freelancer , " says @entity69 , the @entity71 founder of @entity72 in @entity3 , a co-working space that opened in may			2
the cost of going to @entity72 ranges from $ 40 , for a day pass , to over $ 750 per month for a dedicated desk			0
@entity80 sees the demand throughout @entity13 and is looking to expand to other cities in the region			1
for freelancers , who often work in creative industries like design , stuffy cubicles just do not cut it , @entity80 said			2
" there 's definitely this emerging segment of people who do n't want to project a corporate image , but they want a comfortable space to work , " he says			1
the hive touches all the hallmarks that make co-working an attractive alternative to sitting in a coffee shop with a laptop : the space is open , desks equipped with power outlets are meant for sharing , members each get their own lockers , and enclosed meeting rooms provide privacy when needed			0
and , it hosts informative talks and networking events			0
most co-working spaces have a heavy component of building community and encouraging entrepreneurship -- some operators say breaking even is nice but not the primary goal			1
at @entity27 , which occupies a sprawling 14,000 square feet and has a ping - pong table and meditation room , members must pass an application process , showing that they have something to offer the co-working community , whether it be a solid start - up idea , programming skills , mentorship or investment potential			1
" we think @entity3 can use another place to foster entrepreneurs , and we hope talent can collaborate amongst themselves , " says @entity124 , one of @entity126 's founders			0
@entity27 charges $ 125 per month , which is unusually low , but the founders see the program as a kind of social enterprise to support start - ups and smaller businesses			0
the space organizes regular events , including a recent talk on brand licensing and @entity141 , a technology conference that originated in the @entity48 entrepreneurs say in the daily grind , which often means hours sitting in front of a laptop , it helps to know that others are doing the same thing			1
yet people working on internet start - ups do not get much support , as the field is still seen as unconventional in @entity3			1
so for @entity153 , who is starting @entity154 , a site that helps young people get involved in social causes , going to @entity27 provides motivation			0
" it 's different when you 're always seeing people doing stuff that 's cool			0
it 's a big impetus , " she says .			0
