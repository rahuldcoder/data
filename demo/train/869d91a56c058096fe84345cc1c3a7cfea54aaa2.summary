as the @entity1 continues to enforce sanctions on @entity3 over its actions in @entity5 , the @entity0 has announced it is lending one of the controversial @entity7 to a @entity9 museum , describing it as " a marble ambassador of a @entity12 ideal			1
" a statue originally from the @entity15 in @entity16 will go on display at the @entity18 on saturday , @entity0 director @entity13 said in a statement			1
it is the first time the @entity0 has loaned one of the @entity7 to a foreign museum			1
the @entity1 government and other @entity25 and @entity26 nations have imposed sanctions on @entity28 over @entity3 's annexation of @entity30 and allegations of continued interference in eastern @entity5			1
@entity1 's sanctions are not cultural , instead targeting @entity3 's financial , defense and energy sectors , as well as imposing asset bans and travel restrictions on specific individuals			1
however , @entity13 's statement did touch upon the issue : " the @entity42 have always believed that such loans must continue between museums in spite of political disagreements between governments , " @entity13 said			0
" it is a position energetically shared by our counterparts in @entity3			0
" western countries and the @entity5 government in @entity53 accuse @entity28 of sending troops and military equipment into eastern @entity5 to help @entity57 separatists fighting against government forces			0
@entity3 officials have persistently denied their military is involved			0
at the @entity63 summit in @entity64 last month , @entity1 prime minister @entity61 warned @entity3 to change course over @entity5			0
otherwise , @entity61 said , " the relationship that @entity1 has with @entity3 , that the @entity25 has with @entity3 , the relationship that i hope @entity64 has with @entity3 , will be very different			0
" ' provocation to @entity16 people ' @entity16 has for decades been demanding the return of the sculptures , which were " acquired " by @entity73 between 1801 and 1805 , bought from him by the @entity72 in 1816 , and later presented to the @entity0			1
@entity16 prime minister @entity74 described the decision to loan the sculpture as " a provocation to the @entity16 people			2
" " the @entity15 and its sculptures have been looted			2
the value of the sculptures is priceless , " he said			0
" we @entity16 identify with our history and culture , which can not be fragmented , loaned or bestowed			0
" the @entity7 are a series of sculptures in a frieze that once adorned the upper sections of the @entity15 in the @entity16 capital of @entity89			1
the sculpture being loaned to @entity3 , of the river god @entity93 , " is one of the finest of those to survive from the @entity15 , " the @entity0 said			1
describing itself as " the most generous lending museum in the world , " the museum said the loan was part of ongoing exchanges with the @entity18 , which had requested it to mark the 250th anniversary of its foundation			1
" the @entity0 is a museum of the world , for the world and nothing demonstrates this more than the loan of a @entity15 sculpture to the @entity18 in @entity9 to celebrate its 250th anniversary , " @entity13 said			1
@entity111 , director of the @entity18 , said : " i am delighted that this important , beautiful and significant sculpture has been lent in celebration of our two museums ' shared values and will be seen alongside the permanent classical sculptures of the @entity18			2
" the @entity0 says the statues " are part of the world 's shared heritage and transcend political boundaries			2
" @entity16 's prime minister said the decision to send the @entity126 statue to @entity3 disproved what he said was the @entity0 's rationale for retaining the @entity129			1
" the last , until now , @entity1 doctrine that the @entity7 could not be moved is no longer valid -- as their other ' argument ' for the lack of an appropriate space to house them collapsed with the opening of the @entity137 , " @entity74 said			0
the @entity15 was a temple in ancient @entity89 ' @entity139 citadel , built in the 5th century @entity140 the @entity141 says the area is believed to have been largely intact until the 17th century , but after damage in warfare , foreign visitors began taking parts of the structure as souvenirs			0
" it was in the 19th century that @entity73 removed intact architectural sculptures from the frieze , the metopes and the pediments of the building , " the museum says			2
the latest @entity141 building was completed in 2007 and is the place " where eventually the @entity15 sculptures will be reunited , " the museum says			1
it says the @entity15 frieze was originally 160 meters long			0
" from the entire frieze that survives today , 50 meters are in the @entity141 , 80 meters in the @entity0 , one block in the @entity171 , " the museum said , adding that " other fragments are scattered " among museums in @entity165 , the @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169			0
earlier this year , @entity172 said it had received a request from @entity16 to mediate in the dispute between @entity16 and @entity1 over the @entity7			2
