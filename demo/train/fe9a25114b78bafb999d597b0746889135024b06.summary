so , are the @entity2 's two head coaches a couple of caught - red - handed cheaters ? is @entity6 's top running back a tight - lipped , lewd lout ? is a standout seahawk defensive back a big - mouthed braggart ? is the superstar @entity11 quarterback a dishonest dude or a scatterbrain ? and what about that former @entity16 pass catcher who 's been charged with cold - blooded murder ? let 's not forget about him			1
ah , welcome to @entity2 week , during which we will hear countless hours of well - deserved blah - blah - blah praise about the skills of the participants , while simultaneously wondering about the gentlemen in charge on each sideline , or about the true personality that lies hidden behind each player 's face mask			1
are these men to admire ? do we need them to be ? many of us on sunday will merely want to eat our @entity34 wings , watch the @entity36 horses and puppies in the tv commercials and see what @entity39 is or is n't wearing when she sings at halftime , then get back to the game to decide if @entity6 or @entity16 will be " world champions " ( even though teams from the rest of the world are not invited )			1
but this year , more than any past year , it seems , the @entity47 is coming under scrutiny more for the kind of product it is producing off the field of play			1
the physical abuse of women or children by some players has made headlines			2
as has this latest focus of attention , a brouhaha over whether @entity16 quarterback @entity59 — deliberately or otherwise — used a " deflated " football in a conference championship game that was allegedly much easier to pass and catch than the opposing team 's ball			1
the image problem of the @entity47 as a league of thugs and punks wo n't be helped by the publicity surrounding the case of 25 - year - old @entity73 , once a tight end for the @entity11 , which goes to trial this week			2
@entity73 is accused of the 2013 murder of a semi-pro football player named @entity78			2
and you could feel the league 's executives cringe when the entire focus of a january 18 game between the @entity11 and the @entity84 turned out to be not which side would be proceeding to the @entity2 , but whether the winners somehow managed to use a football that was not properly inflated			1
it did n't help that @entity11 coach @entity89 , who has denied knowing anything about the deflated balls , has previously had to answer to accusations of unethically " spying " on another team			2
@entity89 was fined $ 500,000 by the @entity47 in 2007 after it became clear that the @entity11 had filmed the @entity97 ' defensive signals			2
it was the largest such fine in the league 's history , and the team itself got slapped with an additional $ 250,000 penalty			0
but for those who think @entity89 a sinner and @entity6 's coach a saint , keep in mind that @entity110 , coach of the @entity111 , was in charge of a @entity114 program that was handed a two - year bowl ban among other sanctions for alleged wrongdoing , including , @entity104 noted , " improper benefits to @entity120 winner @entity119			0
" @entity110 left for the @entity47 while others remained behind , paying for what occurred at @entity114 under his watch			0
meanwhile , @entity110 's current team has been stoking the @entity11 controversy , with outspoken defensive back @entity126 seeming to insinuate that the @entity47 's commissioner and @entity11 ' owner were so buddy - buddy the @entity16 would go unpunished			1
and his teammate , @entity129 , has reportedly been fined twice this season already for making lewd gestures while celebrating a touchdown			0
what he might pull on sunday is now anybody 's guess			1
@entity135 and clowns have been omnipresent at @entity47 games for years , most of them receivers			0
what began innocently enough many decades ago , when a @entity142 receiver , @entity141 , " spiked " the football after a touchdown pass , has snowballed into a succession of look - at - me acts			0
there was @entity151 pulling a @entity152 out of his sock after a touchdown and autographing the ball ( for which he reportedly received a $ 20,000 fine ) , @entity157 hiding a mobile phone behind a goal post and pretending to make a call on it ( $ 30,000 fine ) , and @entity162 doing a @entity163 , pretending to propose to a cheerleader , donning a jacket implying he was bound for the @entity166 , and even holding up a sign reading " dear @entity47 , please do n't fine me again ! ! ! ! ! " ( for which he earned another $ 10,000 fine )			0
there 's been plenty more : @entity171 waved goodbye to opponents as he ran to the end zone , @entity170 made a snow angel , @entity175 pretended to moon another team 's fans , and @entity179 and others " dunked " the ball over the goal - post crossbar after touchdowns			0
the @entity184 ' @entity183 may have gotten the dunk banned when he almost brought the crossbar down doing it one game			1
tv sportscaster @entity189 got so sick of it , he once aired a commentary deriding football 's " mindless exhibitionism " and " buffoonery , " saying there 's a difference between genuine enthusiasm and what @entity189 called " calculated displays of obnoxious self - indulgence			0
" " @entity204 " is a tag the @entity47 acquired after attempting to limit some of its athletes ' outlandish acts			0
but as we can see from recent events , " no fun " is the least of the league 's worries			0
just play the damn game , you guys , would you , please ? join us on @entity214 / @entity213 .			1

@entity2 this sunday takes place against *backdrop* of controversy
@entity220 : just play the damn game !
