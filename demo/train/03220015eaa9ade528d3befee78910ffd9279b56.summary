@entity0 , @entity1 -- world powers meeting friday in @entity1 called for a political solution in @entity5 and what one diplomat called a " tsunami wave " of pressure to peel away internal support for the embattled regime of @entity12			2
" we agreed on increasing the pressure on @entity12 , getting humanitarian aid in as quickly as possible and preparing for a democratic transition , " @entity14 secretary of state @entity13 told reporters			2
" that was my message , and that was the message of the chairman statement that reflected the consensus reached here			0
" that consensus was reached during a day of meetings by the " @entity26 " in the cradle of the @entity28 , where participants laid out the groundwork for a political transition in @entity5 , not unlike the international planning that preceded the changes in @entity34 , where @entity36 's regime was toppled last year			0
representatives of dozens of countries and entities developed a plan to deliver immediate humanitarian aid , to give political legitimacy to the @entity44 opposition and to endorse the idea of a joint @entity48 - @entity47 peacekeeping force			1
as the conference unfolded , @entity52 volunteer rescue crews evacuated seven wounded people in the besieged @entity44 city of @entity56 to @entity57 on the outskirts of the city 's @entity56 neighborhood , a spokeswoman for the @entity50 said			1
twenty unhurt @entity44 were also taken to safety , she said			1
the evacuation of victims marks a glimmer of hope for residents who 'd been pinned down under shelling and sniper fire for weeks			2
@entity50 spokeswoman @entity69 told @entity2 that the organization planned to ask @entity44 authorities for a pause in the fighting every day			1
" we would prefer to have a two - hour humanitarian pause daily , where we would enter the different affected areas , including @entity56 , and deliver much - needed humanitarian aid , " she said in a telephone interview from @entity75			1
asked whether international journalists wounded in the city would be taken out , @entity69 said the mission was " to evacuate all wounded and sick in urgent need of medical assistance without any exception			1
" the state - run @entity86 ( @entity86 ) , citing an official source at the @entity89 , said @entity52 vehicles were dispatched friday , " for humanitarian considerations , to retrieve the foreign journalists who entered @entity5 illegally			1
the source added that the armed groups in @entity56 declined to hand over an injured journalist and the bodies of two others , which jeopardizes the life of the injured journalist and thwarts efforts to return the two bodies to their countries			1
" activists acknowledged that they had declined to turn over the journalists ' bodies or the wounded journalists unless civilians also were taken to safety			2
they said the wounded journalists agreed with that decision			2
in addition , they said , friday 's ambulance runs were carried out as shelling continued in the area			2

" the group formed last october as a coalition of local coordinating committees , political , ethnic and religious groups			0
it asked for humanitarian assistance and the creation of safe havens inside @entity5 to protect refugees seeking sanctuary			0
" the clear goal of the @entity178 and one for which tens of thousands of @entity44 have died or suffered is to achieve full regime change through a process controlled by the @entity44 themselves , " the statement said			1
@entity167 gave the group qualified support , calling it " a leading , legitimate representative of @entity44 seeking peaceful democratic change			1
" she continued to hold out hope for a political solution			0
" @entity12 can still make the choice to end the violence , save lives and spare his country from descending further into ruin but , if he continues to reject that choice , we and the @entity44 people will keep pressure on him until his deadly regime cracks and collapses , because it will , " she said			1
and she appealed to @entity12 's security forces to end the killing			1
" their continuing to kill their brothers and sisters is a stain on their honor , " she said			0
" their refusal to continue this slaughter will make them heroes in the eyes of not only @entity44 , but people of conscience everywhere			2
they can help the guns fall silent			1
we know from many sources there are people around @entity12 who are beginning to hedge their bets			0
they did n't sign up to slaughter people , and they are looking for ways out			0
" she made no reference to helping the militias fighting the @entity12 regime			0
but @entity245 foreign minister @entity244 said that arming the @entity44 opposition is an " excellent idea			2
" @entity14 officials have said they are not ready to take that step but they have not ruled out other options			0
@entity167 said she would address the issue later			2
in @entity254 , @entity14 president @entity253 said he was " encouraged by the international unity " displayed in @entity0			0

" to those @entity44 who still support @entity12 , especially members of the @entity44 military : understand that this regime has no future , " @entity167 said			1
" the longer you carry out its campaign of violence , the more it will stain your honor			0
