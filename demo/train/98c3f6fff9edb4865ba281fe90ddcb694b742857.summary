-- the distraught mother of a missing five - year - old girl broke down in sobs wednesday as she pleaded for help to find her daughter , @entity6 , who was snatched from a street in @entity8 as she played			1
@entity10 ' televised appeal for information was brief but heart - rending in its desperation			1
" it has been 36 hours since our april was taken from us , " she said , her voice shaky with emotion			2
" there must be someone out there who knows where she is and can help the police find her			2
" we are desperate for any news -- april is only five years old			2
please , please help us find her			0
" @entity10 was led away from the news conference in tears			1
police urged the public to share any piece of information that could lead them to the little girl , who was last seen playing with a friend near her home in a small @entity35 town monday			1
no trace of april has been found since she apparently got into a vehicle that stopped on the street and then drove off			1
wednesday , police identified a man arrested the day before on suspicion of abduction as 46 - year - old @entity6			1
the force also released images of @entity45 and a vehicle and appealed for help to trace his movements between monday evening and tuesday afternoon			0
detective superintendent @entity50 , of @entity51 , said officers " are pursuing a number of lines of inquiry , and @entity6 is one of them			1
" he also called on anyone who has any information about the case to contact authorities and end the family 's nightmare			2
" please call us , " he said			0
" do n't assume someone else has contacted us -- even the smallest piece of information could be crucial to the investigation			0
" meanwhile , police , mountain rescue teams and dozens of volunteers continue to scour the town of @entity72 , the surrounding countryside and the nearby @entity74 -- fast - flowing after recent rain -- for any trace of the girl			1
one photograph released by the police shows a pretty , brown - haired child smiling as she shows off a pink summer dress , another has her peering up at the camera shyly , her arm colored with paint			2
her abduction from the street as she played on her bike with a friend has stunned what police say is a close - knit local community			1
the only witnesses were other children , who police had to question sensitively			0
and the usually quiet market town of just over 2,000 people , set in a remote corner of rural @entity8 , is now at the heart of a manhunt that has gripped the nation since the first reports that the little girl had gone missing			2
the owner of one local garage , @entity105 , told @entity0 by telephone tuesday that she had opened her garage to supply fuel to motorists who were searching for the girl , and had not closed it since			0
" last night people were coming all the way from @entity113 , which is 80 miles away in @entity114 , after hearing about the abduction on @entity116 , " she said			0
