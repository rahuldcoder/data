-- @entity2 mayor - elect @entity1 may look like the privileged white male so many @entity4 have come to associate with the face of , and in many cases the problem with , @entity4 politics			1
but as his 19 - year - old daughter , @entity9 , told a crowd at an august fundraiser , @entity1 is not just " some boring white guy			1
" and the truth behind that statement -- not to mention the young woman who made it -- probably won @entity1 the race to become the city 's first @entity19 mayor in 20 years			1
throughout his campaign , @entity1 campaigned on a progressive platform : more jobs , better schools , affordable housing and inclusive city politics			2
but what kept his platform from being rhetoric per usual was the undeniable strikingly visual proof that @entity1 was different in a very modern and appealing way			2
@entity33 's wife , @entity32 , is black ; their two children , @entity9 and @entity36 , are biracial			1
throughout the race , the @entity1 family unit was at the forefront , making frequent campaign appearances , starring in tv ads , choreographing a bizarre but charming dance and otherwise creating many adorable moments , from their family embrace and quirky wardrobe choices on the cover of @entity47 right up to @entity9 's surprise @entity50 visit home from her @entity52 college to vote			1
direct mail pieces introduced " @entity54 , " the " @entity56 family who 's fighting to change @entity2 , " with a picture of the foursome drinking juice and playing @entity59			2
it was a picture so very ordinary and yet not : where some other boring white guy 's white wife might sit is @entity32 , her hair in locs ; next to her is @entity9 with an eyebrow piercing and gauged earlobes			2
sixteen - year - old @entity36 's 6 - inch @entity68 became a favorite topic among the media			0
telegenic family helps lift @entity2 's mayor - elect on " @entity74 , " @entity73 donned a bushy wig and asked the @entity1 family to consider adopting him ; president @entity77 told @entity36 he had the same hairstyle in 1978			1
the hair eventually earned its own hashtag on @entity81 , embodying the power it came to symbolize : # fromentum			0
opponent @entity85 , meanwhile , kept his family largely out of the spotlight , saying they prefer privacy and suggesting on " @entity90 " that @entity1 was " using his family because he has no policies			1
" even if that assertion had been true , what @entity85 discounted was the enduring importance of family in politics and the power of the promise of change and diversity			0
although @entity1 's family might have made him unique in such a major political race , it is far less so when you look at @entity4 as whole			1
according to the @entity109 , interracial and interethnic married couples grew by 28 % over the past decade , from 7 % in 2000 to 10 % in 2010			1
among unmarried couples , the numbers rise still : eighteen percent of opposite - sex unmarried couples , and 21 % of unmarried couples , are interracial			1
among @entity4 children , the multiracial population has increased almost 50 % , to 4.2 million , since 2000 , while the number of people of all ages who identified themselves as both white and black climbed a whopping 134 % since 2000 to 1.8 million people , growing faster as a group than those who identified as a single race			1
@entity33 's election does n't necessarily symbolize a universal or even @entity2 - wide acceptance of interracial marriage			2
but mixed - ethnicity pairings have served other candidates well			0
consider @entity130 's marriage to @entity132 - born @entity131 and , of course , president @entity77 's own racially mixed background			0
at the same time , it was only a few months ago that a commercial for @entity137 featuring an interracial couple and their daughter caused such intense backlash on @entity141 that the comments section had to be closed			0
still , studies have showed that showing affection for family of any color or makeup helps humanize , and differentiate , a political candidate			0
a 2007 @entity150 poll found that three in four @entity4 view " family values " -- which they identify in the context of a political campaign as the family unit , family structure or strong families -- as extremely important in determining their vote			2
this , of course , is the reason the overwhelming majority of elected officials are married with children			0
@entity33 was smart to call on his family , interracial or not			0
was it a political move ? perhaps			0
and the fact that it worked ultimately says far more about the voters than it does the candidate			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity170 .			0

@entity170 : future *nyc* mayor @entity1 's family is all - american in a striking new way
@entity170 : his wife is black and two children are biracial , and they are charming and fun
@entity170 : number of interethnic married couples growing ; number of biracial folks climbing
she says voters *respond* to families , interracial or not , with the values of @entity188
