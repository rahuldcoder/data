-- " @entity6 and the @entity10 " features one of the more soul - destroying death orgies in @entity4 - lit history , with a whole cavalcade of @entity6 supporting players winding up as casualties in the climactic wizard battle			0
the series never shrank from death -- books 4 through 6 each end with a major character dying , and the whole saga begins with @entity6 as a newly orphaned baby			0
but in a new special feature on the " @entity21 " dvd , author @entity18 notes that she 'd planned one fatality that would have probably scarred a generation of young readers			1
as reported by the @entity25 , @entity18 says , " i did seriously consider killing @entity26			1
" apparently , she briefly thought about killing off @entity6 's red - headed sidekick around the middle of the series , when she " was n't in a very happy place			2
" it 's an interesting piece of what - might - have - been trivia			2
in some ways , it reminds me a little bit of the mythic notion that @entity39 was supposed to die in @entity40 -- an idea which was supported by original @entity43 producer @entity42 and @entity44			2
@entity42 told the @entity45 that @entity39 lived because @entity46 did n't want to kill off any of his main characters			0
it 's hard to accuse @entity18 of any such anxiety , given the " @entity10 " bloodbath			1
still , it 's fun to speculate on how such a major change would have altered the book series			0
@entity18 does n't specify in what context she was picturing @entity26 's death , but it 's easy to imagine that he might have bit the dust relatively early			1
lots of people were shocked when @entity18 killed off @entity61 in " @entity62 , " but @entity61 was a minor character who , in hindsight , was always kind of a handsome readymade corpse -- think of how much freakier the latter @entity66 would have felt without good ol ' @entity26 around to relieve the tension			1
conversely , imagine if @entity26 had sacrificed himself in @entity10 ' climax			1
it certainly would have changed the tone of the ending , which was a pretty upbeat @entity73 , all considering			0
