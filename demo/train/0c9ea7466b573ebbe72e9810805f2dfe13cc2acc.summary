@entity0 , @entity1 -- residents of @entity4 , @entity5 , can begin going home sunday morning , more than a week after most of them evacuated ahead of @entity8			1
the staged re-entry through tuesday will include the villages of @entity12 , @entity4 and @entity13 , @entity9 announced thursday			1
" conditions , utility service and other supporting infrastructure in those villages is the most conducive for re-entry at this time , " the county said in a statement			2
" as conditions improve in the remaining villages , re-entry will be established and announced as soon as possible			2
" visitors will not be able to go to @entity4			1
instead , they can stay north of @entity25 , the county said			2
about 2,500 residents of the island who did not take part in a mandatory evacuation have been receiving vital supplies and services			1
the storm washed out a critical stretch of @entity34 , a road that runs parallel to the @entity36 and connects @entity4 to the other barrier islands on @entity5 's @entity38			1
causeways from those barrier islands connect them to @entity5 's mainland			1
meanwhile , president @entity42 declared a disaster in @entity1 , making federal grants and aid available to those who suffered losses from @entity8			1
the money can be used by individuals in @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity54 counties for temporary housing and home repairs , according to the @entity57			1
low - cost loans are available to cover uninsured or under - insured property losses			2
counties eligible for federal funding to do emergency repairs and work are @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity50 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity72 and @entity54			2
the president issued disaster declarations earlier this week in @entity5 , @entity75 and @entity76			1
@entity77 killed 43 people from @entity79 to @entity80 as it marched up the @entity82 over the weekend , dumping torrential rain			2
some of the worst flooding struck @entity1 , @entity75 and upstate @entity76			1
ten - foot - high floodwater poured through @entity87 's 40 - year - old flooring business in @entity0 when @entity77 struck @entity1 over the weekend			1
the family business , where revenue has dwindled in the economic downturn , now faces at least $ 300,000 in damage			2
it 's devastating , " @entity87 said , her voice cracking			2
she is not alone , as the effects of @entity77 continue to be felt in flood - ravaged communities along the @entity97 @entity82			2
flood advisories remained in place thursday for portions of @entity76 , @entity101 , @entity75 , @entity102 and @entity103			2
in the days since @entity77 , the extent of the damage has become more evident in @entity106 , where the storm battered a cluster of communities 50 miles southwest of @entity110			2
" there is a lot of damage left to clean up			0
i know the town of @entity117 has been almost completely condemned , " said @entity114 of neighboring @entity115			0
" @entity118 is n't doing too well either , and @entity119 ( in ) @entity115 has been closed			0
" " it 's safe to say that we probably wo n't be back to normal in the @entity122 for at least a month			0
" in northern @entity75 , the @entity124 has begun to settle back into its banks , the @entity123 said			0
most locations are expected to drop below flood stage during the weekend as the high water works its way downstream			0
the development will be welcome news in the towns of @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 , where about 1,700 residents were evacuated from their homes this week			1
@entity42 will travel to @entity137 on sunday to view the damage , the @entity141 announced			1
the full extent of @entity77 's destruction wo n't be known for some time			0
the federal government estimates that the cost from wind damage alone will exceed $ 1 billion			0
analysts have put the total expected cost of @entity77 much higher			1
agriculture secretary @entity150 said thursday the storm also took a toll on agricultural production			1
" i had an opportunity to take a look at fields in @entity5 , " he said			1
" i have never seen anything like it			0
the corn was just totally destroyed			0
@entity160 hit hard , cotton hit hard			0
" it remains to be seen how some other crops , such as soybeans and tomatoes , fared , he said , but " it 's very clear that farmers in @entity5 , @entity102 , along the @entity82 have suffered pretty significant losses			1
" but , he said , it 's unlikely that higher prices will result , as " we have such a diverse agriculture in the @entity97 and we have so many acres planted and so many different crops			1
i do n't think this is going to affect much of anything			0
" the federal government 's tab for the storm could exhaust the $ 800 million left in the @entity57 's disaster relief fund before the fiscal year ends on september 30			1
with conservative @entity184 , led by rep. @entity185 , @entity102 , calling for spending cuts to offset any increase in emergency funds -- a measure opposed by many @entity190 -- the ability of @entity192 to act quickly on the issue remains uncertain			0
mayor @entity194 of @entity137 said he was " outraged " about the funding dispute			0
" @entity196 has a mind of her own , a will of her own , and we ca n't have the petty wrangling going on when we have folks in dire need , " he said			0
@entity75 gov. @entity204 echoed those sentiments during a news conference wednesday , saying , " we do n't have time to wait for folks in @entity192 to figure out how they want to offset this stuff with the budget cuts			0
our people are suffering now			0
and they need support now			0
" more than 1.1 million customers remained without electricity thursday from @entity5 to @entity216 , the @entity97 @entity213 said -- a decrease from the 1.7 million reported wednesday			1
@entity1 transportation officials made emergency repairs on roads to previously isolated towns , officials said			1
replacing washed - out bridges will take more time			0
in @entity0 , volunteers from across the state descended on the community to help with the cleanup			0
" i could n't sit at home			1
i had to come help , " said @entity230 , as she worked outside @entity87 's gutted flooring shop			0
@entity87 was touched by the gesture of so many helping hands			0
" they 're just people , " she said , pausing			0
" they 're neighbors and in @entity1 we 're all neighbors			1
" @entity2 's @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 and @entity242 contributed to this report .			0
