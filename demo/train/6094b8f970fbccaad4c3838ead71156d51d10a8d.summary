-- dr. @entity1 is being sued for injures sustained by a @entity4 man			1
was this person under dr. @entity1 ' care ? was he someone dr. @entity1 had spoken with about a medical issue ? did dr. @entity1 , in an uncharacteristic fit of anger , punch the @entity4 guy ? nope			1
this man is simply one of the millions of people who have watched dr. @entity16 over the years			1
so why is he suing ? because , the plaintiff claims , he was injured when he tried dr. @entity1 ' home sleep remedy known as the " @entity19			1
" shake your head in disbelief all you want , but this is far from the most ludicrous lawsuit we have seen in recent years			0
who can forget the @entity28 woman who filed a lawsuit in 2011 against the producers of the film " drive " ? her complaint alleged that she was misled by the movie 's trailer which promised " @entity38 " type driving , which , alas , the film did n't deliver			2
and then there was the lawsuit filed last year against the @entity41 by a woman claiming she sustained burns on her legs			0
what did she say the @entity41 did wrong ? she claims they failed to warn her that sitting for an extended period of time on a black bench outside the @entity41 ' stadium on a hot august day could cause burns			0
more ? well , while in @entity53 , a couple sued @entity54 after their son ingested a sauce labeled " @entity57			2
" it should be noted that the sauce bottle bears the image of a skull engulfed in flames			0
and that brings us to dr. oz. on his april 17 , 2012 , show , he offered advice about how to sleep better			1
one suggestion was filling the toe of a pair of socks with uncooked rice			1
the socks were then to be placed in the microwave and heated until warm			2
however , dr. @entity1 expressly warned viewers , " do n't get it too hot , just warm			1
" the heated footsie was then to be worn for 20 minutes			0
the reasoning being that the heated socks will cause blood to be diverted to your feet , which in turn will cool the rest of your body			1
as dr. @entity1 explained , " you 're going to be able to sleep better because your body has to be cold in order to be sleepy			1
" however , the plaintiff claims that he suffered third degree burns from this remedy			0
how ? well , he apparently fell asleep with the socks on and did n't realize his feet had been burned until he woke up in the middle of night and tried to walk			1
the plaintiff also claims that dr. @entity1 should have offered a specific warning to avoid using this remedy to people who , like him , have diabetes and hence less feeling in their feet			1
let 's be honest : these above lawsuits are at best legally questionable and at worst frivolous			1
but do n't blame the person seeking the money			0
personal injury lawyers have enticed people for years with their tv commercials and ads on the walls of buses and trains telling us that if you have been wronged , you might be entitled to a big cash award or settlement			2
this is , of course , followed by the line : " we do n't get paid unless you do			0
" so , understandably , people flock to these lawyers with complaints about every imaginable wrong seeking a payday			1
the lawyers then file lawsuits , hoping for a quick settlement so that they can do as little work as possible before seeing their own payday			2
full disclosure : when i practiced law , i represented corporations against lawsuits			0
consequently , i 'm a bit biased against plaintiffs ' lawyers			0
but it 's easy for even a non-corporate lawyer to see that these ridiculous lawsuits give the reputable plaintiffs ' attorneys -- and , frankly , all lawyers -- a black eye			1
it 's not that i 'm without sympathy for the growing number of lawyers out there struggling to make ends meet			2
the practice of law has grown increasingly competitive and challenging			0
i can understand the lure of taking a questionable case that will reap you some media coverage and money			0
but that 's not a good enough reason to do it			0
lawyers need to collectively rein in these types of cases			2
if they do n't , the government will do it for them under the guise of " tort reform			1
" the new laws that result would in all likelihood make it harder to file a lawsuit and would limit damages in personal injury cases			0
and this will make it even more challenging for lawyers to earn a living			0
worse , these reforms may prevent some truly injured people from receiving the full compensation they deserve because of caps on damages			1
as for dr. @entity1 , i hope that he does n't settle quickly out of court			1
instead , i hope they fully litigate this case			0
in all likelihood he will prevail			0
but even if the plaintiff does ultimately win , it still will have sent a clear message to plaintiffs ' attorneys who take these legally questionable cases : if you want money , you are going to have to really earn it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity202 .			2

@entity202 : dr. @entity1 being sued by @entity4 man who burned his feet on rice in socks
@entity202 says @entity210 's rice sleep aid suggestion gave *rapacious* lawyers chance to *pounce*
he says lawyers seeking quick buck take such cases , settle them , give bad name to lawyers
@entity202 : frivolous suits boost call for tort reform , hurt lawyers in end , and also injured people
