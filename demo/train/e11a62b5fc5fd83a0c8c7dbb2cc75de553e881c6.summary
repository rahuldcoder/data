@entity0 , @entity1 -- some @entity1 mark the anniversary of the september 11 attacks by going to a memorial service or observing a moment of silence			1
for the past 10 years , @entity7 has been helping others			1
every september , @entity9 brings hundreds of volunteers from @entity1 to help another disaster - stricken community in the @entity13			1
" it was our way of saying , you know , @entity1 will never forget what people from around the country and the world did for us in our time of need after 9/11 , " said @entity7 , a 2011 @entity14			1
" so that 's how the mission started			2
it was just to pay forward the kindness that we experienced			1
" over the past decade , @entity9 ' nonprofit , @entity1 says thank you , has assisted victims of wildfires in @entity33 , tornadoes in the @entity35 and @entity36 in @entity37			1
many of those who receive help are so inspired that they travel across the country the next year -- often at their own expense -- to volunteer with @entity7 ' group and help someone else			2
the result is a unique disaster - response organization			1
" all of our volunteers are survivors			1
they survived , whether it was 9/11 or @entity36 or tornadoes			1
so they all share that common bond , " said @entity7 , who quit his job as a venture capitalist to work on his nonprofit full - time			1
this year , @entity9 ' mission has come full circle			1
last weekend , more than 300 volunteers -- at least half of whom were from outside the @entity1 area -- helped rebuild 13 homes damaged by @entity66 in october			1
for @entity7 , a @entity68 , the work carried extra significance			2
triple - amputee veteran gets ' smart ' home on september 11 " being able to travel to other disaster sites and help people is one thing			1
when it happens in your own backyard , you go into shock , " he said			2
" i woke up and realized this was ( like ) @entity36			2
" he pointed out around 650,000 families in @entity1 and @entity82 had damaged or destroyed homes			1
more than 2,000 members of @entity1 's police and fire departments were severely impacted by the storm			1
and because first responders are a core part of his group 's volunteer base , @entity7 decided to help them			2
with the support of corporations , foundations and private donors , his group is planning to rebuild 200 homes in all for active - duty first responders in the @entity1 area			1
police officer @entity100 and his wife , @entity101 , had been married for less than three months when @entity66 destroyed their @entity0 home			2
" the damage to our home ... sea foam , seaweed , shells and starfish , " @entity100 said , " there 's no way to understand the sheer devastation that was in the house			0
the mold , the breathing problems ... our home was completely unlivable			0
" all of the couple 's wedding gifts were under water as well			0
ultimately , the house had to be razed , and they did n't have the resources to rebuild			0
their challenges intensified when @entity101 had a cancer scare in the spring			0
but on the day of her exploratory surgery , they got the news that @entity7 ' group would rebuild their home			0
" we could n't believe it , " @entity100 said			0
" from sitting in that hospital room and wondering what was going to happen ... to building a brand new home from the ground up			0
" it 's a feeling of elation			0
" more than 100 volunteers worked on the @entity144 ' home last weekend , including @entity145 , who came from @entity146 , @entity37 , to lend a hand			1
@entity148 , a former police officer , lost his home in @entity36			0
this is his third volunteer trip with @entity7 ' group			0
" ( after the storm ) , i had a lot of people help me			0
the @entity144 needed our help , and so here we are , " @entity145 said			0
" being here gives the @entity144 the confidence to know that they 're not alone in this adventure			0
" for @entity7 , bringing people together is the most important part of his work			0
" we want to lift up spirits and remember not just the tragedy of ( 9/11 ) , but also the humanity of 9/12			2
" we tell people it 's never about the buildings			0
it 's always about the people			0
at the end of the day , it 's about giving them hope			0
" note lets family know 9/11 victim went down fighting @entity2 's @entity176 contributed to this report .			2

every september , @entity9 organizes help for a disaster - stricken community
the idea is to spread the kind of help that @entity1 received after the 9/11 attacks
many of the volunteers have been helped in the past and want to " pay it forward "
