the @entity0 has dismissed an appeal over same - sex marriage on jurisdictional grounds , ruling wednesday private parties do not have " standing " to defend @entity6 's voter - approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state - sanctioned wedlock			1
the ruling clears the way for same - sex marriages in @entity6 to resume			2
the 5 - 4 decision avoids , for now , a sweeping conclusion on whether same - sex marriage is a constitutional " equal protection " right that would apply to all states			0
read the ruling at issue was whether the @entity21 's guarantee of equal protection under the law prevents states from defining marriage to exclude same - sex couples , and whether a state can revoke same - sex marriage through referendum , as @entity6 did , once it already has been recognized			1
but a majority of the @entity0 opted not to rule on those issues			2
instead , it ruled on " standing " -- whether those who brought the suit to the court were entitled to do so			1
" we have never before upheld the standing of a private party to defend a state statute when state officials have chosen not to , " said chief justice @entity35			1
he was supported by an unusual coalition : fellow conservative justice @entity42 and more liberal justices @entity43 , @entity45 and @entity46			2
by dismissing the case , the court leaves in place the lower court decision in @entity6 that allows same - sex marriage to be reinstated			1
the federal appeals court stay on the decision will be lifted			0
what 's next for gay rights movement ? within hours of the ruling , @entity6 's gov. @entity56 said , " i have directed the @entity58 to advise the state 's counties that they must begin issuing marriage licenses to same - sex couples in @entity6 as soon as the @entity63 confirms the stay is lifted			1
" @entity56 , a @entity65 , said he interpreted the high court opinion as making @entity67 8 unconstitutional and unenforceable			1
the state 's attorney general @entity68 agreed and urged the @entity63 in @entity70 to issue its mandate " immediately			2
" but by law , that can not normally be done so for at least 25 days , to allow for possible new legal challenges			0
as soon as the court lifts the stay , " the wedding bells will ring " said @entity75 on wednesday			0
" this is a huge day for @entity6			2
" but there is legal uncertainty whether the high court 's ruling could be enforced statewide , or limited to only a few jurisdictions			1
it was act two in a closely watched pair of high court appeals over state and federal laws and the limits of recognizing the ability of gay and lesbian couples to wed. the outcome of the rulings gives same - sex couples much to be encouraged about			1
@entity6 voters approved proposition 8 in 2008 with 52 % of the vote shortly after the state @entity0 ruled same - sex marriages are legal			2
the measure put gay and lesbian marriages on hold in the state , but a federal appeals court later rule @entity67 was unconstitutional			1
two of the original plaintiffs -- @entity108 and @entity109 , a @entity110 , @entity6 , couple who want to marry but could not because of @entity67 -- contended the state was discriminating against them because of their sexuality			1
" this is about our freedom and our liberty , " @entity108 told @entity115			0
" we are not trying to topple marriage			0
we are not trying to redefine marriage			0
what we are trying to say is that equality is the backbone of our country			0
" both they and @entity126 and @entity127 , the other plaintiff couple from @entity129 , were in the courtroom when the rulings came out			0
they were cheered when emerging from the court building			0
their views were echoed by fellow same - sex marriage supporters , who rallied outside the court with the hope that the justices will eventually issue a broad ruling to strike down bans nationwide			0
in dissent , justice @entity142 said the court 's majority ignored the initiative process that led to the passage of @entity67			1
key quotes from the ruling " what the court fails to grasp or accept is the basic premise of the initiative process			1
the essence of democracy is that the right to make law rests in the people and flows to the government , not the other way around			0
@entity162 resides first in the people without need of a grant from government , " he said			0
" the @entity6 initiative process embodies these principles and has done so for over a century			1
... in @entity6 and the 26 other states that permit initiatives and popular referendums , the people have exercised their own inherent sovereign right to govern themselves			2
the court today frustrates that choice			0
" @entity142 was joined by justices @entity176 , @entity178 and @entity179			2
some @entity67 supporters argued the high court ruling means the voter referendum remains in place and enforceable			1
" @entity67 being the law of the state of @entity6 makes it clear that marriage is only one man and one woman			1
the four plaintiffs that brought this lawsuit may have a right to get marriage licenses issued to them			0
but this was not a class - action lawsuit			0
it does not apply statewide , " said @entity197 , senior counsel at the @entity162			0
" because there 's no appellate decision holding it unconstitutional under the @entity201 , which is what controls this interpretation , @entity67 remains the law of that state			1
@entity205 has a family : a same - sex couple 's remarkable journey the case is @entity126 ( 12 - 144 ) .			0

the high court opts not to consider the issues of the appeal
instead , it rules on whether those who brought the suit to the court were entitled to do so
state officials had *refused* to defend @entity67 after a @entity6 court *suspended* it
justice @entity142 , in dissent , says the court 's majority undercut the initiative process
