-- aliens have taken over @entity2 and the invasion is gathering pace			0
first it was @entity7 clips , then appearances with the mayor			0
now they 're on the shelves of every corner shop and immortalized in statues across the city			0
or at least that 's how visitors to the @entity16 might imagine the futuristic , one - eyed creatures plastered on everything from key rings to double - decker buses			1
they are of course @entity23 's @entity24 and @entity25 mascots -- wenlock and @entity26			1
and with the @entity28 just days away you 'd better get used to seeing a whole lot more of that giant eyeball			2
with their metallic bodies , built - in cameras and sci - fi genetics , it 's an ambitious design aimed at the digital age			1
but does it work ? are these otherworldly creatures the cutting edge of design or just plain creepy ? described as everything from " a drunken one - night stand between a @entity47 and a @entity48 , " to having " just the right balance of digital zeitgeist and cheeky playfulness , " it seems people still are n't quite sure what to make of @entity23 's mascots			1
cute and cuddly they ai n't @entity52 set the standard for cute and cuddly animals as the first mascot at the @entity56			0
likewise @entity57 opted for the adorable , if unimaginative , @entity58 in 1980			0
the @entity24 mascot has always been aimed at children -- and the wallets of their parents			1
but it 's also an embodiment of the host city 's personality and a lasting legacy of its games			2
driving all of this is a massive merchandise operation			0
sure , @entity72 and @entity26 need to look good -- but they also need to sell			1
@entity74 are hoping to make Â£ 80 million ( $ 124 million ) from merchandise sales alone			0
" i think they started as a pretty ambitious pair with real potential to be used across a new medium -- social media			0
but i do n't think they 've pulled it off completely , " @entity82 , deputy editor of @entity2 design magazine , @entity83 , told @entity0			2
" i do n't think people have been able to warm to them because they 're kind of severe looking with this massive eye			0
maybe that 's what 's alienated people because they ca n't quite get a handle on what they are			2
" they 're missing a little bit of soul			0
" 4 billions reasons to watch the @entity16 right			0
so what are they ? but maybe that 's just the response from an " older , stuffier generation , " as @entity72 and @entity26 co-designer @entity101 told @entity0			1
the pair were designed by marketing agency @entity103 and named after the @entity105 town of @entity106 , which helped inspire @entity107 to launch the modern olympics , and the @entity110 village of @entity26 , where the @entity25 were founded			1
supposedly created out of magical droplets of steel left over from the @entity116 , every element of their design is laden with symbolism			2
the taxi lights on their heads refer to @entity2 's black cabs and their origins from a steel melting pot are likened to multicultural @entity123			2
their distinctive giant eyes even have built - in cameras to record their experiences			1
though in a country with one of the highest number of cctv cameras in the world , this particular symbolism may be a little too close to home			0
the children 's mascot but perhaps the most important critic is the children they were created for			2
" the brief stated , ' @entity142 young people to get involved with sport			0
' we judge the success by the response of young people to our creations , " @entity101 said			0
" if you look at sites like the @entity152 's @entity151 you 'll see the overwhelming positive feedback that @entity72 and @entity26 have received			1
when you have eight - year - olds saying how cool they look and they want them to visit their school , we know we 've done our job			0
" mechanical objects are no less endearing than wide - eyed animals , @entity101 argues , pointing to the success of @entity162 's @entity161 as nine - year - old @entity163 said on the @entity151 website : " i think the mascots are really cool because they look like amazing robots			1
" 10 strangest @entity24 sports sinister spoofs some adults are n't so convinced			1
when @entity72 figurines dressed in police uniforms appeared on @entity173 , quick - witted reviewers saw it as an opportunity to deride the " creepy " toy			1
" i bought this product amidst my keenness for the @entity23 , " one reviewer posted			1
" however when it arrived it knocked down the door in a raid , pinned me down and falsely arrested me for conspiring a bomb plot for mass murder during this summer 's sporting events			0
" with the army being called in to help boost security amid the @entity190 crisis , and residents complaining about anti-terror missiles on their rooftops , there 's already been a huge focus on @entity2 's perceived heavy - handedness in the buildup to the @entity28			1
it 's an unfortunate context for @entity72 and @entity26 , as @entity82 jokes : " seeing that eye you 're reminded you 're on your best behavior , looking over your shoulder to make sure you 're not wearing a @entity203 t - shirt in the venue			1
" @entity16 regardless of your opinion on their design , there 's no denying @entity72 and @entity26 's impressive social media credentials			1
as momentum builds around the first " @entity16 , " @entity2 's mascots are well equipped with their own @entity16 accounts , @entity214 pages , @entity7 clips and interactive website			2
" we felt that previous mascots had been one - dimensional and had followed a predictable path			2
we knew that to connect with young people we had to create characters designed for the digital age , " @entity101 said			1
how history remembers them is yet to be seen			0
