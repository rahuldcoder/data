-- friday 's @entity2 meeting with congressional leaders is a timid first step by president @entity5 toward learning to work effectively with a @entity6 that will now be controlled by @entity7			1
it will not be easy , judging from president @entity5 's and sen. @entity10 's post-election press conferences on wednesday			1
@entity5 and @entity11 both talked about cooperation			1
but both also were very confrontational about the possibility of the president issuing executive orders on immigration ( @entity11 appropriately so given the lawless and unprecedented nature of what the president is contemplating )			1
president @entity5 's press conference was almost two different events			1
one was conciliatory and suggested to the voters , " i hear you			0
" the other was confrontational and almost hostile , asserting that he will do what he wants through executive action unless @entity7 give him exactly what he wants through legislation			2
friday 's meeting is too large and too pro-forma to advance the ball much on building an effective working relationship or addressing immigration			2
it will almost certainly be largely a dog and pony show			0
in the days that follow , however , president @entity5 faces an important strategic choice between two paths forward , one productive , the other destructive			1
the first option , the path toward a productive working relationship , is clear			0
house speaker @entity45 and presumptive majority leader @entity10 have each laid down markers for how a productive way forward can take place			2
to start , @entity45 outlined five areas of reform in an important speech at the @entity52 in september			0
president @entity5 should be looking at those five areas for opportunities to work together			1
@entity45 and @entity11 published a very clear call for reform on thursday and listed several areas that could be the basis for working together			1
in january 2014 , @entity11 gave a very important speech on the floor of the @entity61 about reversing @entity63 's tight control and returning the @entity61 to its role as a true deliberative body			1
he was immediately followed by sen. @entity67 calling on the @entity61 to restore the manner in which former senate majority leader @entity69 , a @entity70 , ran the institution -- a model of a collegial , committee - led deliberative body			0
( the fact that both @entity11 and @entity67 were young staffers when @entity76 was majority leader is an important factor in understanding how the new @entity80 majority will operate			1
) the commitment @entity11 expressed in that speech to a committee - centered , collegial @entity61 offers president @entity5 and @entity61 @entity84 the opportunity to work together in a productive way that sen. @entity63 denied to @entity7 for the last eight years			1
with the foundation laid by @entity45 and @entity11 , what will then be needed are systematic and serious steps toward finding ways to work together			2
the most important step toward working together -- is to work together			0
president @entity92 had breakfast regularly with house speaker @entity94 and majority leader @entity95 after the @entity7 were routed in the 1958 election			2
the three of them got a lot done in @entity92 's last two years in office			0
there is no substitute for president @entity5 meeting regularly , preferably weekly , with @entity45 and @entity11			1
these meetings should be private , off - the - record and each principal should bring only one staff person			0
the three leaders should start by focusing on small , confidence - building measures and avoid the big fights in the short term			2
they have to build a rhythm of achievement and mutual trust for anything to work			0
this can be difficult , largely because of two things the myopic , politics - obsessed coterie of analysts , consultants and staff fails to understand			0
the first is that history often intrudes on their plans and demands an effective government			0
there are many things national leaders have to deal with because history wo n't wait			1
this requires leaders to compartmentalize their thinking and their emotions			2
president @entity136 and i were able to work on international financial crises , national security issues and other pressing topics no matter what political fights we were in			1
the new governing trio will need the same capacity to cooperate on some matters despite conflict on others			0
second , the legislative season for the new @entity6 runs through the summer of 2016			0
the @entity150 mantra that there are only a few months of substance before the presidential campaign and politics overwhelms it is just baloney			0
we passed and president @entity136 signed welfare reform in august 1996 in the middle of the presidential campaign			1
president @entity5 and congressional leaders can take a bit of time to build an effective working relationship			1
if they can start small and build while ignoring ( temporarily at least ) the stories of the day , the president and the new @entity6 have a strong chance of finding ways to work together			2
if , however , president @entity5 takes the other path before him -- pursuing the vision of an unrestrained executive he sketched in his press conference -- he is likely to have a very difficult time collaborating with @entity6 on anything			1
it will be hard for congressional leadership to work effectively with a president who brazenly disregards the constitutional powers of the legislative branch , as the actions he reportedly is contemplating apparently would			2
even if the @entity80 leadership wants to push forward on areas other than immigration , actions as destructive as the president suggests he will undertake will poison the atmosphere with much of the nation and their representatives on @entity188			1
such an outcome also means the country will have that much harder a time facing national and international crises			0
the responsibility for such a destructive atmosphere and relationship with @entity6 will be the president 's alone			0
if president @entity5 wants to have the effective working relationship with @entity6 that he says he does , he will have to take the path that can lead to such a relationship			1
the other path is a path to national pain and division			0
a lot depends on the next few weeks			0
it will be fascinating to watch			0
join us on @entity210 / @entity209 .			0
