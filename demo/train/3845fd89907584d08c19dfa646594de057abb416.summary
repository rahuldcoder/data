-- tanker cars involved in the calamitous derailment in @entity5 in july were carrying fuel that was improperly described in shipping documents as being less volatile than it actually was , @entity2 safety investigators said wednesday			1
the train was hauling highly volatile petroleum crude oil , a " @entity11 , @entity13 " product			1
but shipping papers identified the fuel as a less volatile " @entity13 " product , investigator @entity14 said			1
the discovery helps explain " why the fuel ignited so quickly " after the derailment on july 6 in @entity19 , @entity14 said			1
forty - seven people were killed in the ensuing explosion and fire that leveled the tiny community 's downtown			1
but investigators did not say whether the shipping error was intentional or inadvertent , and left open the question about whether the error made a difference			2
both types of fuel -- @entity32 -- are shipped in the same @entity34 tank cars , @entity14 said			1
shipments of both classifications of fuel were allowed to travel through the @entity5 town			1
and local firefighters said their emergency response would have been identical , he said			2
but @entity14 said the investigation remains open , saying " our work 's not done			2
" investigators say the events were set in motion when a fire was reported on the train			2
the train 's engine was shut down and the fire was extinguished , but a rail employee left the scene without setting enough brakes to keep the train from rolling			0
it then rolled down a grade into the center of @entity59			0
@entity14 said it was the responsibility of the company receiving the shipment -- @entity63 -- to properly identify the shipment			0
@entity63 , which was shipping the petroleum crude oil from the @entity67 oil field in @entity68 to its refinery in @entity70 , did not return a call to @entity0 for comment			0
@entity14 also said the board 's findings thus far hold significance beyond the @entity19 tragedy			1
the incident " brings into question the adequacy of @entity34 tank cars " for transporting large quantities of low flash - point flammable liquids			0
and , in letters to @entity2 and @entity85 regulators , the @entity84 ( tsb ) asked them to check the accuracy of train manifests			0
" it 's important that dangerous goods in transport be properly described			0
there are people that may have to handle that , that come in contact with that , and they need to know the hazards of what they 're dealing with , " he said			0
the @entity85 @entity103 , said in a statement wednesday that is issued a safety advisory in august addressing the issue of accurate labeling			2
the @entity85 @entity108 also launched an inspection operation to verify that shippers and rail carriers are properly classifying crude oil .			0
