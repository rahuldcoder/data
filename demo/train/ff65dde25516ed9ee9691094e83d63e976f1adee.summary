-- a @entity2 attorney representing a convicted murderer recently pardoned by @entity5 's outgoing governor says his client will not attend a @entity8 hearing this week on the constitutionality of his and some 200 other pardons			1
" he 's not going to go , " @entity12 , @entity2 , attorney @entity11 said of his client , @entity13			1
" he 's not a fugitive and there 's no valid order that says he needs to appear , " @entity11 told @entity0			2
on thursday , the @entity8 will hear arguments brought by @entity5 attorney general @entity18 challenging the legality of scores of pardons issued by outgoing gov. @entity22			1
@entity13 was one of four men convicted of murder who were pardoned by @entity22 in january and released from state custody			1
the four had been working as " trusties " at the governor 's mansion			0
the releases were quickly challenged by @entity18 , who contends that the pardons are unconstitutional because most of the inmates involved did not fulfill all of the requirements to get a pardon			2
specifically , they did not file legal notices in newspapers local to where their crimes were committed for a 30 - day period as required by law			0
@entity13 's whereabouts were unknown after his release until he was located last week in @entity41 , @entity2 , and served with papers telling him to appear in court in @entity5			1
@entity18 's office said last week that if @entity46 does not comply , a judge has the authority to hold him in contempt			0
but @entity0 senior legal analyst @entity49 had a different opinion on the case as a civil -- not criminal -- matter at this point			0
" he ( @entity46 ) probably safely could ignore that piece of paper , " @entity49 said last week on @entity0 's " @entity54 360			0
" but if the attorney general succeeds in having the pardons declared invalid , " his ( @entity46 's ) pardon is no longer valid			1
then , the attorney general can get an arrest warrant and -- if ( the attorney general ) can find him at that point -- bring him back			1
" added @entity13 's @entity2 attorney , " he has n't even been required to file an answer in the civil case			1
there 's no use in him being a spectator			0
it 's just legal arguments			0
" " the question is if there is any jurisdiction for a court to review a pardon in the first place , " @entity11 told @entity0			0
a spokesman for the attorney general told @entity0 that @entity18 would not have any comment on the case until after the thursday hearing			1
@entity13 was sentenced to life in prison in 1994 after he admitted he was part of a gang that robbed a convenience store in @entity91 , @entity5			1
the store clerk was killed in the robbery			0
@entity46 entered a plea to avoid the death penalty , admitting that he entered the convenience store and after one of his accomplices shot the clerk , @entity99 , three times , @entity13 walked up to @entity101 , who was crawling from behind the store counter , and shot him twice in the head			2
@entity13 said that he did that so that the clerk could not later identify him			2
the @entity8 is expected to make a ruling on whether the pardons can even be challenged			2
if the court rules against the pardoned criminals , a lower court would be asked to hold hearings on each individual case			2
" if the thing goes back to the trial court and resumes again , we 're going to litigate these issues on whether there is extradition -- if it comes to that -- but it 's a long way away , " said @entity11			0
last week , at a news conference , attorney general @entity18 said that if the court finds in his favor , he will have @entity46 arrested " as soon as we can lay hands on him			1
" but @entity18 said he hopes @entity46 will turn himself in			0
" we 'll see what kind of man he is , " @entity18 said .			0
