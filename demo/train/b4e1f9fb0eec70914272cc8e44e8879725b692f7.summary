appearing online tuesday , it seems to show a @entity4 military pilot being burned alive while confined in a cage			0
@entity7 has released footage of its killings before			1

" it 's a kind of atrocity pornography , " @entity15 tells @entity1			1
she is the author of " your fatwa does not apply here : untold stories from the @entity22			2
" " it 's truly horrifying when you watch the video and you see them really relishing in inflicting suffering deliberately on another human being , and in showing that suffering to the world , " @entity15 says			1
@entity1 is not showing images of the pilot 's killing			2
here are ways in which the latest @entity7 video marks a potential turning point : the 22 - minute video is highly orchestrated , shot from multiple camera angles			1
the pilot , @entity38 , is forced to play a part in his own execution			0
he 's seen walking and sitting at a table , speaking , before he appears inside the cage			2
a member of @entity7 lights a long fuse that leads to @entity38			1
fire engulfs the pilot and he eventually collapses			0
a bulldozer then comes to bury him , his hands sticking out from the debris			0
" @entity7 is in the business of propaganda and terrorism is the business of theater			1
and in many ways , i think they 're upping the ante in terms of the attention and the brutality that they 're engaged in , " says @entity55 , a former @entity56 deputy national security adviser			0
@entity55 adds that he thinks @entity7 is trying to send a message to the @entity66 members of the @entity56 - led coalition against @entity7 in @entity68 and @entity69			1
" they 're going to be treated brutally , and in fact , maybe perhaps more brutally than other members of the coalition , " he says			0
previous @entity7 videos have shown the killings of @entity77 captives			1
one posted last week shows the death of @entity80 journalist @entity79			0

a reward is offered for their deaths			0
many analysts are predicting the video will backfire on @entity7 , isolating anyone on the fence about its ideology and tactics			1

it 's going after existing terrorists , competing with @entity132 for foreign fighters			0
