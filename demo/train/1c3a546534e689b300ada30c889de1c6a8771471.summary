-- a 224 - foot - long @entity4 warship will have to be cut into smaller pieces to get it off a @entity8 reef where it grounded two weeks ago , @entity2 officials said wednesday			1
they said that 's the only way to prevent further damage to the @entity12 , a @entity8 national park and @entity13 , where the @entity14 , an @entity15 , ran aground on january 17			1
survivors mark anniversary of cruise ship grounding lt. @entity19 , a @entity4 navy @entity20 spokesman in @entity21 , @entity22 , told @entity0 on wednesday that @entity2 salvage experts are still formulating the details of how they 'll cut up the 1,312 - ton minesweeper			1
crews are now working to remove any hazardous materials from the vessel and will look to save anything that could still prove useful to the @entity2			1
the ship 's 15,000 gallons of diesel fuel were removed last week			1
" we will strip it out beforehand			2
we 'll work to salvage any parts that can be salvaged , " @entity19 said			2
then the cutting will begin			0
illegal weapons seized from ship heavy - lift cranes are expected at the site of the grounding , about 80 miles ( 130 kilometers ) east - southeast of @entity38 in the @entity39 , in the next few days , @entity19 said			1
the cranes will lift the pieces of the @entity14 onto barges or other ships to be taken away			0
last week , the @entity2 said it hoped to lift the ship off the reef in its entirety			1
but @entity19 said wednesday that after reviewing all the alternatives , it was decided it would have to be cut up			0
after it struck the reef , initial efforts to free the @entity14 at high tide were unsuccessful			1
its crew of 79 was evacuated to other vessels , and the ship was battered by waves that pushed it farther onto the reef , causing leaks in its wood - and - fiberglass hull			1
" the ship can not move on its own , and it is not operational , " rear adm. @entity64 said last week			1
stripping , cutting up and removing the @entity14 from the reef could take more than a month , @entity19 said wednesday			1
this is n't the first time the @entity2 has had to undertake such an operation , but it has n't happened in more than 40 years			0
in august 1971 , the supply ship @entity72 grounded in @entity74 harbor during @entity75 , @entity19 said			2
it took more than a month to cut that vessel up and remove it , he said			0
a similar operation was also conducted in 1916 , he said			0
as for what the loss of the @entity14 , one of 14 @entity15 class mine countermeasures ships in the @entity2 , means for the service , @entity19 said it was too early to speculate			0
he pointed out that the vessel was in the 23rd year of its expected 30 - year lifespan			0
the ship cost about $ 61 million to build , lt. cmdr			2
@entity89 , a @entity2 spokesman , said last week			0
as for other costs , @entity8 officials said last week that the @entity8 would seek compensation for damage to the reef			1
about 1,000 square meters ( about 10,760 square feet ) of it have been damaged			0
" it 's a damage to a world heritage site			0
it 's a damage to our natural resources			0
it 's a damage to an important site			0
we can not but put emphasis on the importance of this reef as a heritage site , " presidential spokesman @entity103 said			2
@entity2 commander apologizes for grounding the reef is home to a vast array of sea , air and land creatures , as well as sizable lagoons and two coral islands			1
about 500 species of fish and 350 species of coral can be found there , as can whales , dolphins , sharks , turtles and breeding seabirds , according to @entity128			1
the salvage operation must ensure that the reef sustains no further damage , @entity103 said			2
@entity2 officials are still trying to determine how the @entity14 ended up on the reef			2
@entity89 , the @entity2 spokesman , said last week that the @entity4 @entity135 , which prepares the digital navigation charts used by the @entity2 , has reported the location of the reef was misplaced on a chart by nine miles			1
" the @entity2 investigation will review what charts @entity14 was using			0
while this erroneous navigation chart data is important information , no one should jump to conclusions , " @entity89 said			0
" it is critical that the @entity2 conduct a comprehensive investigation that assesses all the facts and circumstances surrounding the @entity14 grounding			0

@entity4 minesweeper has been stuck off @entity8 since january 17
attempts to *float* the ship at high tide failed
crews are removing fuel , hazardous materials , salvageable things
