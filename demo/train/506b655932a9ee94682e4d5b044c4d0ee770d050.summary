@entity0 , @entity1 -- it was as if the giant crowd were celebrating a joyous occasion -- not a coming - together one month after a deadly earthquake			1
thousands of @entity1 , many of them smiling , gathered friday at the center of @entity0 to remember the 7.0 - magnitude quake of january 12 that leveled most of their capital city			1
a sea of people waved their arms in the air , prayed , cried , sang and -- where space permitted -- danced			1
the earthquake is blamed for killing more than 212,000 people , injuring 300,000 and leaving more than 1 million homeless in the city of 3 million and surrounding communities			1
the memorial took place near where the stately @entity26 lies in ruins and the @entity29 square has been turned into a huge homeless camp			1
other memorials were taking place at shantytowns , and there were religious observations			2
haitians were urged to wear black or white			2
there was an outpouring of aid from around the world after the quake -- more than 600 aid agencies rallied -- but , initially , much of their work was ineffective because of the chaos , including the disruption of the government after its buildings collapsed			1
relief operations are improving day by day , a spokeswoman for the @entity49 told @entity2 on friday			2
" things [ supplies ] are moving now , and they are arriving to populations			2
the bottleneck has really , really decreased , " @entity54 said			2
" about a month ago , when this quake destroyed the infrastructure of @entity1 , it was very complicated to get aid in , " she said			1
now , " the ports and airports are n't at full capacity , but things are arriving and getting to populations			0
there is much more to be done , but food is coming in			0
" food distribution areas are set up around the capital , she said			0
according to the @entity71 ambassador to @entity1 , food is now being delivered routinely to 16 sites daily , and @entity1 are receiving two weeks of rations			1
the food is culturally appropriate , @entity74 said			0
" one month on ... i think we are in a very good place in terms of food distribution , water distribution and getting medicines out to needy hospitals , " he said			0
the @entity71 is working with many nations and organizations to do that			0
" the next issues we 're most concerned about are sanitation issues and shelter issues , " @entity74 said during a @entity87 news conference			1
as the rainy season approaches , " we want to make sure we have reached and touched as many people as possible			2
" the rainy season comes with the approach of spring			0
the hurricane season begins june 1			2
relief workers are providing temporary camps with latrines and portable toilets , and that project is n't finished , @entity74 said			0
@entity101 said her organization also is trying to provide sufficient sanitation			0
" we ... are working on a large - scale buildup of providing clean water , latrines , showers , hand - washing stations , which affect not only the livelihoods of basic survival but , really , health			2
there 's a massive concern of the possible outbreak of disease , and so we are working to combat that quickly			0
" @entity118 talk about the situation in @entity1 on thursday , @entity121 real estate developer @entity120 said he was donating three used @entity123 tents for use as a temporary headquarters for the government and a hospital in @entity0			1
they will provide a total of 33,000 square feet of space , he said			0
medically , " things have improved in a very good way , " compared with the period right after the quake , when doctors were dealing with broken bones , crushed limbs and other acute conditions , @entity2 's dr. @entity131 said			1
the medical establishment is much more organized			0
however , recovery facilities are grossly inadequate , he said			0
of the people lined up recently at one of @entity0 's largest public hospitals , most were suffering from chronic diseases such as diabetes			1
many have never seen a doctor , he said			0
after treatment , most patients -- even those who have had major surgery -- end up in a temporary tent city that is dirty and lacks medications , follow - up care and nutritious food , @entity131 said			1
recent rain did n't help , he said , and there is fear that improvements wo n't be made before monsoons come			0
" people are trying to recover in a temporary tent city that is increasingly becoming more permanent , " @entity131 said .			1
