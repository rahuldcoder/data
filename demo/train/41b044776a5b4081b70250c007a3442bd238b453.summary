-- @entity1 has been at the forefront of the @entity4 documentary scene ever since his bombshell of a first film in 1967			1
" @entity12 " may sound like a burlesque extravaganza , but in fact the film was a deeply disturbing expose of life inside a correctional institution for the criminally insane			2
since then , @entity1 has built up an extraordinary body of work			1
it includes nearly 40 feature films , many of them more than three hours long , largely preoccupied with examining the apparatus of social institutions : hospitals , high schools , parks and zoos			0
all of them are framed according to @entity1 's own rigorous observational style , which involves sustained scrutiny , no voice - over and no interviews			1
he 's into process , not personality			0
with a @entity1 film , it 's up to the viewer to supply the commentary			1
that 's easier when the subject concerns alleged inadequate welfare programs or dysfunctional government institutions			0
in his last few films , the septuagenarian director has turned his gaze on less overtly political matters : the esteemed @entity45 company in " @entity46 " ( 2009 ) ; an @entity49 , @entity48 , training facility in " @entity50 " ( 2010 ) ; and now , a @entity52 cabaret , in " @entity53			1
" in this loose - limbed documentary , @entity1 is more like an impressionist painter -- @entity56 is the obvious example -- than a social activist or a reporter			1
he 's looking at the human body , at model physical specimens and at perceptions of beauty			0
" @entity53 " can be viewed as a series of nude studies built around the contrast between the dancers ' casual nakedness backstage and the highly fetishistic , filtered nudity on stage			1
surprisingly ( and disappointingly ) , @entity1 foregrounds the latter ; we scarcely learn the dancers ' names and rarely hear them speak			1
you might expect marked differences between a distinguished ballet company and a glorified strip club , but @entity1 seems to see them in much in the same light ( not literally ; the chromatic effects at the club are designed to dazzle , and they do )			1
the @entity53 , or " @entity53 " for short , aspires to art with almost comical sincerity			1
this is @entity52 , after all , and intellectuals are a prime target audience			0
like " @entity46 , " the new film dedicates most of its running time to rehearsal and performance , interspersed with sometimes tense exchanges behind the scenes involving the creative personnel ( in this case , primarily director / choreographer @entity95 ) and management ( managing director @entity98 )			1
the " artistes " always want more time , and the shareholders are invariably fixated on the bottom line			2
which is understandable at the @entity53 , where dancing cheek to cheek means something very different from what @entity106 had in mind			2
( or did he ? ) at various points , the people who work there describe it as the best chic nude club in the world , and the classiest			2
a better description might be the kitschiest			0
in one routine , @entity119 's dancers enact a " @entity122 " number as if it were " @entity123			0
" in another , they parade around in @entity127 bearskin hats and not much else			0
( if the club had a uniform , it would be a thong -- though high heels and fishnets also feature strongly			0
) the music is mostly a cheesy mix of classic bump - and - grind and ' 70s @entity138 sex comedy			2
once or twice , the choreography does break the mold -- to push into the exploratory eroticism of modern interpretative dance -- but at heart , the sensuality celebrated here is as safe and conventional as a @entity147 bunny			0
does @entity1 disagree ? of course he never says so , but the film is laced with enough subtly suggestive ironies to prick all that oh - so - @entity151 pomposity and pretension , without ever undermining the discipline and commitment of dancers and choreographers			1
" be pretty , classy , relaxed -- and calm -- and push your buttocks out , " recommends a stage manager to a group of new girls before their audition			0
" @entity163 " this ai n't			0
@entity1 may be the one documentarian on @entity166 uninterested in revealing who makes the cut			2
still , it 's clear this is excellent advice ; maybe all you need to know to get by in @entity53			2
brightly photographed in high definition , the movie is an eyeful all right , but at 134 minutes , it 's also a rather lengthy tease .			0
