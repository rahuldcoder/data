-- lampooning politicians in @entity4 's @entity3 newspaper has been cartoonist @entity5 's job since 1992 , but it was his vocation long before that			1
better known by his pen name @entity5 , @entity5 started drawing as a teenager and soon found that blending satire with his drawings could lead to a career			2
freelance jobs at newspapers and magazines in @entity17 and @entity4 followed for @entity19 's @entity18 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
since 1992 , @entity5 has worked as an editorial cartoonist and illustrator for the @entity4 - based @entity24 , the largest newspaper in @entity25 and @entity26			1
but now the cartoonist has taken his @entity29 black - and - white satirizing from the page to the screen			2
@entity5 was the brains behind " the @entity33 , " @entity4 's first satirical puppet tv show that aired earlier this year			1
" the @entity33 " is based on the hugely popular " @entity42 " show that aired in the @entity36 from 1984 to 1996 , and @entity38 's popular " @entity37 , " featuring latex caricature puppets of politicians and celebrities			1
" the @entity33 " had been in the pipeline since 2002 , but @entity5 found it a tough sell to broadcasters in areas where more @entity49 - style satire had not been seen before			1
there was also the issue of keeping editorial control over the project			0
" we said , ' we would control the content , because we know where we want to take this			0
we want it to be independent			0
we want it to be fair			0
we want it to be hard - hitting , ' " @entity5 told @entity61 magazine			2
in the end , financial support from the @entity64 arrived to breathe life into the project and its latex puppets			0
while entertaining , the show is also making people think about and discuss the issues that made @entity72 pick up his pen and get " the @entity33 " on air			2
@entity4 's disputed election in december 2007 added even more fuel to his expos√© of @entity4 politics			1
" after the 2007 elections , we argued that it was the right time for a show like this , that @entity4 needed a show like this : we have one [ coalition ] government and no opposition so we needed to strengthen criticism , " @entity5 told the @entity87			1
many do n't take kindly to the criticism ; @entity5 has allegedly faced threats to his personal safety during his career			0
but that " the @entity33 " could be broadcast shows a freedom of media in @entity4 that @entity5 appreciates			1
as for keeping a keen eye on the country 's politicians , he believes it 's not his job alone			0
" i think it 's everybody 's duty , " he told the @entity104			0
" you ca n't put that responsibility on one individual , as every @entity4 should contribute to expose what is happening and to expose corruption			0
" watch @entity5 on @entity0 on @entity113 voices on saturday , november 7 , 11.30 and 18.30 gmt sunday , november 8 , 17.00 gmt			0
