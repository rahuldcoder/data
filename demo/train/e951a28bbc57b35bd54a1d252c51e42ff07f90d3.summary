-- @entity2 nations could be penalized by being stripped of some powers if they fail to manage their budgets , according to a memo from @entity7 president @entity6 leaked tuesday			1
the confidential memo , sent out to leaders ahead of the final @entity11 meeting of the year at the end of the week , comes only a day after the leaders of @entity14 and @entity15 agreed in @entity16 on a new fiscal pact they say will help prevent another debt crisis			1
but @entity6 's proposals , details of which were obtained by @entity0 , are perhaps even stricter than those of @entity14 chancellor @entity23 and @entity15 president @entity24			1
the five - page memo proposes that the @entity7 could perhaps be given the right to strip voting rights within the @entity28 from some countries who have been bailed out but are still not meeting their deficit targets for " member states that are under an assistance program and have consistently failed to meet the conditionality , the ( @entity2 ) @entity7 could receive exceptional power such as ex-ante approval of all major economic reforms , " the document says			1
as such , the executive arm of the @entity28 could force bailed - out countries , such as @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 , to comply with deficit regulations , which for the entire @entity28 currently stand at 3 % of gdp			2
those rules have been in place for many years but @entity28 leaders are looking for a way to have them more tightly enforced in order to restore confidence in eurozone debt			2
@entity6 's proposals indicate continuing differences of opinion with other key decision - makers in @entity2 over how to handle the region 's debt crisis			0
the proposed change of protocol @entity6 has put forward would not need to be fully ratified by all the member states , a person familiar with the plans told @entity0			0
@entity23 and @entity24 , heads of the two largest economies in the 17 - nation eurozone , said monday that their pact , to be presented in detail friday , would involve amending or rewriting the treaties that govern the @entity28 to force members to manage their budgets in a more structured and coherent way			1
they are expected to write to @entity6 on wednesday to find out whether their initiative would be embraced by all 27 @entity28 countries or just the 17 that share the single currency			0
ahead of that move , prime minister @entity78 warned tuesday he would not sign any reworked @entity28 treaty that does not protect @entity82 interests			1
" what i 'm saying is that if -- and eurozone countries do need to come together , do need to do more things together -- if they choose to use the @entity2 treaty to do that , @entity82 will be insisting on some safeguards , too , and as long as we get those , then that treaty can go ahead			1
if we ca n't get those , it wo n't , " he told the @entity93			0
resolving the eurozone crisis is a priority , @entity78 said , but he would be going to @entity98 to " defend and promote " @entity82 interests , including the @entity82 financial services sector			1
as the head of the @entity7 , @entity6 is expected to steer discussions between the member states as they meet for the final @entity28 summit of the year			2
both @entity23 and @entity24 ruled out monday the concept of pooling eurozone debt under so - called " eurobonds , " saying such discussions were premature			0
however , @entity6 's memo appears to open the door to such an idea further down the line			0
he recommends leaders consider " opening up the possibility in a longer term perspective of moving towards common debt issuance in a staged and criteria - based approach , " according to the leaked memo			1
@entity24 said monday in @entity16 that the debt crisis , which has shaken markets around the world , must be resolved by march next year			0
meanwhile , @entity121 's placed 15 members of the euro currency union on review for a possible downgrade monday , as the debt crisis in the eurozone continues to worsen			0
the warning applies to @entity132 - rated nations such as @entity14 , @entity15 , the @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 , the @entity129 - based credit rating agency said in a press release			2
a downgrade of @entity15 or another of the region 's top - rated nations would have serious consequences for the @entity142			0
the @entity142 , a government - backed bailout fund , could lose its aaa rating if the nations that stand behind it are downgraded .			0

new : @entity149 warns he may not sign a new @entity28 treaty if @entity82 interests are at risk
leaked memo sets out tough *measures* for countries that fail to manage budgets
it comes a day after the leaders of @entity15 and @entity14 agreed to a new fiscal pact
@entity2 leaders are in @entity98 later this week for their last summit of the year
