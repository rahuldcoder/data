@entity0 -- all @entity2 wanted was lunch			0
a 14 - year old student in a special education classroom in @entity6 , @entity2 was living with a foster family because of a history of neglect , including malnutrition			1
but on this day in 2002 , his teacher tried to punish him by withholding food , despite the abuse he had suffered as a young child			1
@entity2 's teacher delayed his lunch for hours to discipline him for refusing to do his work			0
when he would n't comply , his teacher put him in a face down restraint and sat on him in front of his classmates			1
@entity2 said repeatedly that he could not breathe			0
he died minutes later on the classroom floor			0
@entity2 's tragic story is n't an isolated case in @entity26 's schools today			1
according to the @entity28 , over the last 20 years there have been hundreds of allegations of school personnel using restraint and seclusion in abusive ways on children			1
it 's happening disproportionately to students with disabilities , often at the hands of untrained staff			1
many of these students bear haunting physical and emotional scars			1
and in a number of cases , students have died			1
it 's difficult to believe , but there are no federal laws to prevent this from happening			1
local newspapers recount bone - chilling stories of schoolchildren tied to chairs , or with their mouths taped shut , sometimes locked in dark closets , or pinned to the floor for hours at a time			0
if parents treat their kids this way , it 's considered a criminal offense			1
but unlike in hospitals and other institutions that receive federal taxpayer funding , there are no federal protections against these abusive practices when they happen in schools			1
the @entity71 regulates how and when restraint and seclusion can be used in medical settings and community facilities			1
but classrooms , where students spend the majority of their day , are exempt			1
in the absence of a federal standard , state protections for kids are all over the map			1
many states have no regulations whatsoever			0
children are left vulnerable and staff untrained			0
restraint and seclusion techniques should be used only as a last resort , when someone is in imminent danger of physical injury and there are no alternatives			1
without proper training , staff can be hurt and students , especially small children , are at risk			1
yet the @entity28 and news reports confirm that these practices are used frequently , often as discipline , when students are n't physically aggressive			2
while there is no centralized reporting , data from the few states that do track incidents paints a troubling picture			0
in the 2007 - 2008 school year in @entity111 alone , the @entity28 reports , there were more than 14,300 cases of restraint , seclusion and other " emergency interventions			2
" we do n't know how many of these merited real emergencies			0
in one @entity111 case , @entity118 , a young girl with @entity120 's syndrome , was restrained in class because she was wiggling her loose tooth			2
her mother , who had never consented to physical interventions , had no idea restraint was regularly imposed until her daughter came home with bruises			2
as parents , when we send our children to school , we expect they will be safe from danger			0
and when the very people we entrust with our children 's well - being inflict this type of abuse , it 's not just the victims and their families who suffer			2
it hurts their classmates , who witness these terrifying events			2
it undermines the vast majority of teachers and staff who are trying to give students a quality education			1
it 's a nightmare for everyone involved			0
the easy answer here would be to blame teachers			2
but it would be the wrong one			0
ultimately , the root of this problem has been our system - wide failure to provide direction and enforcement			2
as long as school systems continue to lack the tools they need to create good policies and properly train staff , these incidents will continue			2
the solution is a balanced approach to make classrooms safe for students and teachers			1
with that goal in mind , on wednesday we are introducing legislation to finally ensure that schools in every state have the resources they need to prevent inappropriate restraint and seclusion			1
our bill would set minimum safety standards in schools , similar to the protections children already receive in other institutions , so that states can ensure appropriate school district policies			2
it would limit physical restraints or locked seclusion to situations involving imminent danger , and require staff to be trained in administering these practices			0
it would outlaw mechanical restraints , such as strapping kids to chairs , and prohibit restraints that restrict breathing			0
it will increase transparency and oversight , so we will finally know just how widespread these practices are , and provide the secretary of education with tools to enforce the law			1
and it would give schools the support they need to equip their staff to handle difficult situations in the most positive manner possible			0
in a time of deep partisan divide , some may wonder what prompted strange bedfellows -- a member of @entity224 leadership and a member of @entity227 leadership -- to team up			0
it 's as simple as this : schools are places for our children to learn , grow , and thrive			0
as a nation we must do better			0
it 's time to ensure that no child in this country suffers the same fate as @entity2			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity26 reps			0

reps . @entity241 and @entity242 say kids sometimes restrained abusively in schools
no federal laws prevent this , they say , and it happens disproportionately to special ed kids
they say students , teachers , classmates are all *harmed* by abuse , with lasting effects
@entity241 , @entity242 : new law would train teachers , limit restraint , provide oversight
