@entity0 , @entity1 -- the polls and the campaign dialogue are n't much help in assessing the @entity7 factor in the @entity1 and @entity9 primaries			1
the distinct feeling on the ground was that it had an impact , leading many evangelical christians to reject pragmatic arguments to ignore @entity16 's @entity15 because of his presumed electability			1
in a pattern dating back to the single - issue campaigns of the segregation era , discussion of this underground religious division was conducted almost entirely through code words and signals and was mainly missing from public forums and press accounts			1
the strongest signal came from @entity1 gov. @entity28 , who had a political ally reveal election day morning that he was voting for @entity31			1
the announcement came on the statewide " @entity37 " radio show , described by the @entity34 as having " broad appeal to evangelical , conservative voters			0
" the news flashed around the state long before the polls closed			0
everyone understood what was meant by a subsequent @entity44 posting by @entity28 , who in the last gubernatorial primary rode the church vote to victory over a better qualified @entity49 opponent			2
@entity28 said he voted for @entity31 because he considered him the " most conservative candidate " in the field			2
among two - thirds of @entity54 , that description translates to most - like - us - religiously			0
also on election morning , the president of the baptist - affiliated @entity56 , dr. @entity57 , addressed religious divisions obliquely in a prominent op - ed piece addressed to " persons of faith " in the @entity63			2
" honest interpretations of scripture " among @entity69 " have formed hard lines that make it hard for us to agree , " he wrote			0
he then endorsed @entity31 as the best representative of " @entity72 ideals			0
" few people spoke as candidly as a caller to the popular @entity76 radio show			0
he noted that president @entity77 was a congregant of the rev. @entity78 and @entity16 is a @entity7			1
he concluded " hold your nose " and vote for the lesser of two evils			0
bloc voting by evangelicals is a standard feature of @entity86 @entity49 politics , and polls show it has also fueled @entity31 's rise nationally			1
belief blog : @entity16 stumbles in bible belt students of the theocratic strain in @entity86 politics may recall that @entity94 was once a major force in the region 's elections			2
but the fact that both @entity31 and @entity98 are @entity99 had little impact this time			1
the @entity102 's @entity49 @entity69 base vote has been unified since 1980 , when @entity103 urban @entity99 and @entity86 born - agains rallied to @entity105			1
religious or racial prejudice is notoriously hard for pollsters to measure			0
the @entity108 found that @entity109 and @entity31 together got two - thirds of the evangelical vote in @entity1 and @entity9			1
@entity16 got 27 % in @entity1 and 29 % in @entity9			2
those numbers probably reflect the number of establishment republicans in those states , a group that was notably subdued in the days before the election			0
would anti-mormon feeling in the @entity102 hurt @entity16 in a general election ? that 's not likely , since about half the @entity49 voters in @entity1 and @entity9 believe @entity77 is a @entity122			1
in any event , the @entity102 is so much a one - party region that nothing will get the @entity127 ticket in the hunt			2
but in contested states , religion , like race , could be a tilt factor that the press seems reluctant to engage			0
join us at @entity44 / @entity135 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity138 .			0

@entity140 : @entity16 's @entity15 was under - the - radar issue in *tuesday* 's primaries
he says @entity1 *governor* 's backing " most conservative " @entity31 was code for religious ally
he says in 1980 @entity69 unified with @entity99 over @entity105 , creating a base
@entity138 : @entity16 's @entity152 less hurtful in run against @entity77 ; @entity102 will still go @entity49
