@entity0 , @entity1 -- conflicting accounts of a botched @entity4 raid that killed five @entity1 in february have led to a new investigation ordered by the top @entity9 commander in @entity1 , a @entity4 military spokesman said monday			1
lt. col. @entity10 , a @entity4 spokesman , said gen. @entity11 , who oversees all @entity9 and @entity4 troops in @entity1 , called for the review after receiving a briefing from @entity1 officials in late march			1
on sunday , @entity4 acknowledged that its troops killed five @entity1 in the nighttime raid in february , after initially saying the civilians may have been the victims of an " honor killing			1
" although civilian casualties at the hands of @entity4 troops have fallen off in recent months , such incidents have strained the relationship between @entity1 and the @entity26 nations that make up the @entity27			1
according to two @entity9 military officials , in the march briefing , @entity1 officials from the @entity29 told @entity11 that after the incident , they visited the compound where the @entity1 were killed and found evidence of bloodstained walls being washed down and bullets being dug out			1
@entity11 wants a thorough review now to see why @entity9 and @entity1 accounts differ so greatly , according to one of the sources , a senior @entity9 official familiar with the briefing			0
the senior @entity9 official said that by the time the @entity1 investigators got to the compound , the people who lived there may have been attempting to clean it up			1
@entity4 officials believe the @entity9 and @entity1 troops may have dug some bullets out of the wall for purposes of the initial investigation , which is a common practice , the official said			1
in march , the @entity27 released a statement denying a report by a @entity57 newspaper that @entity4 had covered up the involvement of troops in the incident			0
@entity9 officials continue to deny that there was any coverup of @entity9 involvement			0
" we have no evidence to date anything improper was done , " the senior @entity9 official said			0
at the time of the february 12 incident , @entity4 said its troops went to a compound in the village of @entity72 in @entity74 province , believing it to be a militant hideout			1
a firefight ensued , and several insurgents died , @entity4 said at the time			2
when soldiers entered the compound , they found the bodies of two men and two women who had been shot " execution - style , " a senior @entity9 military official said then			1
" it has the earmarks of a traditional honor killing , " the official said , adding that the women were found bound and gagged			1
an honor killing is a slaying carried out by a family or community member against someone thought to have brought dishonor to them			1
the senior @entity9 military official said that at the time , it was n't clear whether dishonor in the case stemmed from accusations of acts such as adultery or even cooperation with @entity4 forces			2
but on sunday , @entity4 made an about - face from its earlier claims			0
" international forces were responsible for the deaths of three women who were in the same compound where two men were killed by the joint @entity1 - international patrol searching for a @entity117 insurgent , " @entity4 said in a statement			1
there was no explanation given for the cause of the third woman 's death or why it was n't mentioned previously			0
the two armed men whom troops killed were not insurgents , @entity4 said sunday			1
" the force went to the compound based on reliable information in search of a @entity117 insurgent and believed that the two men posed a threat to their personal safety , " the @entity4 statement said			1
" we now understand that the men killed were only trying to protect their families			0
" @entity4 said a lack of forensic evidence made it difficult to determine how or when the three women died			2
but it concluded that they were killed when troops fired at the men			0
as for the initial report about the women being found bound and gagged , the @entity4 statement said it stemmed from a cultural misunderstanding			2
" the statement noted the women had been bound and gagged , but this information was taken from an initial report by the international members of the joint force who were not familiar with @entity152 burial customs , " the statement said , without elaborating			0
@entity4 troops who went to the scene after the raid may have misinterpreted burial rites			2
@entity157 wrap their dead in clean white cloth before they are placed in the ground			0
@entity4 said it will apologize to the victims ' family members and offer compensation in accordance with local customs			0
the @entity4 admission follows the fatal shooting of five @entity1 soldiers by troops in a friendly fire incident in northern @entity1 on friday			2
@entity1 president @entity171 has strongly criticized civilian deaths by international troops , and the deaths have bred resentment among many @entity1			2
the numbers have fallen off in recent months since @entity11 took over as @entity9 commander in @entity1			0
" it is better to miss a target than to cause civilian casualties , " @entity11 said in december			2
" we can always target enemy leaders later			0
we ca n't make up for the fact that we killed civilians			0
" @entity2 's @entity185 contributed to this report .			0
