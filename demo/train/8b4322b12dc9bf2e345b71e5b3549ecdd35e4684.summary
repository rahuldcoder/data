@entity1 struck the lucky shot which slipped through @entity8 goalkeeper @entity16 's hands to earn a 1 - 1 draw for the @entity2 in its opening game of the @entity10 last saturday in @entity19			1
but the @entity2 played well to avoid defeat against one of the @entity10 's most highly fancied teams and @entity1 said the experience of reaching last year 's @entity25 final had given the @entity2 players the confidence to compete with the competition 's best sides			1
the @entity2 team beat @entity31 champions @entity7 2 - 0 in the semifinals of that tournament and led @entity6 by two goals in the final before going down 3 - 2 to a late winner			2
" before the game ( against @entity8 ) , we knew that if we played our best , we would get a result out of the game and we did that at the @entity25 playing against the top teams , " @entity1 told @entity0			2

" we know what the game is going to be like and we know what we need to do to be successful			0
that mentality is going to take us where we want to go			0
" with the top two in the group advancing to the knockout stages , the @entity2 and @entity8 are favorites to progress ahead of @entity11 and @entity59			0
but with @entity11 beating @entity59 in their opening game , @entity1 said the @entity2 could not afford to slip up against a team representing the smallest country to qualify for the finals			1
" if we lose this game , potentially we 'll be out of the tournament , so we have to go out there and make sure that , yeah , we do take chances going forward but calculated risks , " said @entity1			2
" you ca n't just say ' everybody go because we 've got to post a win ' and be countered and get scored on			0
" @entity42 , the son of @entity2 coach @entity73 , said the @entity2 players would treat @entity11 with the same respect they showed @entity8			1
" the term favorites or underdogs ... these words , you guys use them but they 're not words that we use , " @entity42 said			0
" we had a lot of respect for @entity8 , we knew it was going to be a difficult game , and i can tell you we have a lot of respect for @entity11 and we know that will be a difficult game too			0
