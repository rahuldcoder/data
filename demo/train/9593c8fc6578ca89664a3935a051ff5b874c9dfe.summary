@entity0 -- politically sensitive issues such as immigration , border security , drug trafficking and trade took center stage in @entity0 on wednesday as president @entity8 welcomed his @entity10 counterpart , @entity9 , to the @entity11			1
both leaders used the occasion -- the fourth time they have met for bilateral talks -- to take sharp aim at @entity18 's new law meant to crack down on illegal immigrants			1
@entity9 characterized the measure as discriminatory ; @entity8 called it a " misdirected expression of frustration			1
" the leaders criticized the law while meeting with reporters shortly after @entity8 , vice president @entity27 and secretary of state @entity28 rolled out the red carpet for @entity9 in a formal @entity11 arrival ceremony			1
@entity32 first lady @entity31 and @entity10 first lady @entity33 joined their husbands for the occasion , which was to be followed by a state dinner wednesday night			1
@entity9 is to address a joint session of @entity38 on thursday			2
" our progress today marks another step forward in a new era of cooperation and partnership between our countries , a partnership based on mutual interests , mutual respect and mutual responsibility , " @entity8 said			2
@entity9 said the @entity32 and @entity50 now face a series of common challenges , including climate change and organized crime , which is a rising threat to border stability			1
but what ultimately " turns us into good neighbors " is a common belief in " freedom , justice and democracy , " he said			0
@entity8 ticked through a list of items he said the two leaders had agreed upon during their meeting			2
on the economy , he said , they had agreed to streamline regulations while strengthening protection of intellectual property			0
to facilitate trade , they had reaffirmed a " commitment to a 21st - century border that is modern , secure and efficient			0
" he also pledged to expand joint initiatives promoting renewable energy and " smart grid " technology			1
turning to illegal drug and weapons trafficking , @entity8 noted that his administration is now screening 100 percent of south - bound rail cargo			2
moving in the other direction , @entity10 authorities in recent years have seized 45,000 weapons that could be traced to the @entity32			0
@entity8 also cited new initiatives to cut @entity32 demand for illegal drugs			1
" as your partner , we 'll give you the support you need to prevail ... against the drug cartels that have unleashed horrific violence in so many communities , " @entity8 told @entity9			1
drug violence claimed 6,500 lives in @entity50 last year			1
but @entity9 said 90 percent of the casualties from the war on drugs are criminals fighting each other , adding that the cartels " are not winning			0
" " the @entity10 gangs are passing through a very unstable process ... and fighting each other and that explains most of those casualties , " @entity9 said on @entity1 's " @entity104			2
" he acknowledged , however , that innocent people have also been killed			0
@entity8 also noted @entity50 's current seat on the @entity111 , highlighting the two countries ' agreement on possible sanctions against @entity115 to stop @entity117 's current nuclear program			1
the issue of @entity18 's new immigration law , however , consumed most of the leaders ' time during their meeting with reporters			1
the measure , which will allow law enforcement officers to ask for proof of legal residency of anyone who is being investigated for a crime or possible legal infraction , has drawn widespread criticism in @entity50			2
critics contend , among other things , that the law will lead to racial profiling against @entity137 residents			0
later wednesday , @entity9 acknowledged that immigration is the biggest challenge @entity50 is facing with the @entity32			1
" it is provoking a lot of tensions between our people , " @entity9 said			0
" this is a phenomenon that we need to solve			0
... and the best way to solve that is creating new jobs in @entity50 and that is exactly what we are trying to do			0
" @entity9 said @entity50 is working to change its own immigration policies to address criticisms from officials in @entity157 , @entity18 and @entity50 who claim they 're only trying to do in their states what @entity50 is doing in the southern part of its country			1
@entity9 said that illegal immigration has not been a crime in @entity50 since last year			1
" in the past , @entity10 authorities were in an unfortunate way in the treatment ( of immigrants ) , " he said			0
" we changed already the law and that is different today			0
we are trying to write a new story			0
" regarding @entity18 's tough new immigration law , @entity9 said the potential for racial profiling with the statute " is against any sense of human rights			1
" @entity8 said he thinks the @entity18 law " has the potential of being applied in a discriminatory fashion			1
... a fair reading of the language of the statute indicates that it gives the possibility of individuals who are deemed suspicious of being illegal immigrants from being harassed or arrested			0
" the judgments that are going to be made in applying this law are troublesome , " he noted			0
@entity8 noted that he has directed the @entity190 " to look very carefully at the language of this law to see whether it comports both with our core values and existing legal standards , as well as the fact that the federal government is ultimately the one charged with immigration policy			1
" @entity8 said he 'll make some decisions about how to address the law after he gets a final report from the justice officials			2
a broad coalition of civil rights groups filed a class - action lawsuit against the measure monday , arguing that it violates the @entity32 @entity211 's equal protection and free speech guarantees , among other things			2
in @entity18 , the city councils of @entity215 and @entity216 have also decided to challenge the law in court			2
a majority of @entity32 , however , appears to back to the measure			0
fifty - nine percent of adults nationwide supported the law in a may 6 - 9 @entity222			0
thirty - two percent opposed it			0
the @entity18 law , @entity8 asserted wednesday , " expresses some of the frustrations that the @entity32 people have had in not fixing a broken immigration system , and , frankly , the failures of the federal government to get this done			1
i 'm sympathetic to those frustrations			0
" @entity8 repeated his call for comprehensive immigration reform but said such a measure ca n't pass without @entity236 support			2
a @entity10 official familiar with arrangements for @entity9 's visit cautioned that it would be wrong to let the controversy over @entity18 's law overwhelm the rest of the visit			1
" it will not define the visit or the relationship , " the @entity10 official said			0
" the @entity32 - @entity10 relationship is much more rich and diverse than one issue			0
" a senior @entity8 administration official , however , acknowledged that " this is an issue that has resonated in @entity50 ( and ) is of deep concern to the @entity10 government			2
" this month , @entity50 's ambassador to the @entity32 , @entity255 , warned of " a worrying surge " of anti-immigrant sentiments			1
he warned that the @entity18 law might " poison the well from which our two nations have found and should continue to find inspiration for a joint future of prosperity , security , tolerance and justice			1
" @entity1 's @entity268 and @entity269 contributed to this report .			0
