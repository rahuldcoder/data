it 's 8 p.m. in @entity1 , @entity2 , just across the @entity3 from @entity4			1
for lt. detective @entity7 , his day is about to get busy			2
after about 30 minutes , @entity7 , head of the @entity8 of the @entity9 , leaves to meet with a confidential informant who has been assisting with a case			0
" when we make contact with this person , hopefully they will be able to make a call to any number of their sources , and we 'll try to buy some heroin off the street tonight			1
... this is basically the meat and potatoes of what we do , " @entity7 says			2
@entity1 is in the middle of a heroin epidemic			1
in march , gov. @entity29 declared a public health emergency in @entity2 in response to the growing opioid addiction sweeping the entire state			1
from 2000 to 2012 , the number of unintentional opiate overdoses in @entity2 increased by 90 % , he said			1
according to the @entity37 , it 's happening all across @entity38			0
the demand for heroin is reaching unprecedented proportions -- fueled in part by a growing number of people who get hooked on prescription painkillers and soon need a cheaper way to get high			2
like heroin , the painkillers morphine , methadone , hydrocodone and oxycodone are all opioids and have a similar effect on the nervous system			2
heroin , however , is cheaper to get and easier to find			2
@entity56 mom survives darkness of addiction in @entity1 , according to @entity7 , the majority of illegal prescription pill sales take place behind closed doors , but a heroin deal can be made in the heart of downtown @entity1 , at a busy part of town called @entity67			1
@entity7 says in @entity1 , one small dose of heroin runs $ 10 to $ 40 depending on size and quality			1
prescription opioids , on the other hand , sell for $ 1 per milligram , or $ 80 for one 80mg pill			0
after waiting for the informant to meet with an alleged dealer and make the buy , @entity7 and several other detectives take the informant into custody			2
they search the informant to make sure there is no pocketed heroin or cash , and have the person hand over the drugs			1
the informant has bought five small bags of heroin			2
@entity7 and his team will use the information to build a case against the dealers and secure search warrants and arrest warrants			0
informants often work with police to get their own charges reduced			2
" for every 10 people we arrest , there 's probably 15 or 20 people that are waiting to take over because of the money they could make			0
it 's such a lucrative business , you know			0
why would you want to deliver pizza for $ 8 an hour when you can make $ 800 ? " but @entity7 says @entity1 is not so different from any other town when it comes to drugs			1
" the smallest community in the heartland of @entity38 is going to have some type of drug problem , " he says			0
" i mean drugs are , you hate to say , they 're as @entity38 as apple pie			1
" @entity7 describes an artery - like network of distribution and delivery that ensures a steady flow of heroin , prescription narcotics , and other drugs into the country -- eventually working its way into small cities and towns like @entity1			1
from @entity131 or @entity132 , the drugs make it into the @entity38 , @entity7 says			0
the drugs are smuggled into @entity135 , then @entity136 and @entity137 before heading into @entity2 and the @entity4 area			1
from there , it is a short trip across the @entity141 to @entity1			1
@entity7 says small cities often have a tougher battle against drugs than bigger cities because of lower income and resources			0
" the more affluent a community , sometimes they 're able to keep their problems more under wraps than a city that has somewhat less of population who is well off			0
it 's supply and demand , and if the buyers were n't here , the dealers would have to look elsewhere to sell			0
it 's a double - edged sword			0
if the dealers were n't here , the buyers would n't come around			0
" what 's more , much of the drug problem in @entity1 does n't come from inside @entity1 , @entity7 says			1
he estimates 50 % of the city 's heroin buyers and dealers come from the bordering cities of @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 and , of course , @entity4			0
" when they 're arrested , they 'll give us their information -- where they are from , where they were born , and just being familiar with the area , we know certain communities are a lot more affluent then say , @entity1			1
they come here , and we 'll ask them how did you end up here from a suburb of million - dollar homes , and they 'll say they got hooked on opiates , they ran out of money , they 're not available there like they are here , " says @entity7 , " the easiest way to look at it is , drugs have no borders			1
" with a department of around 100 , @entity7 and his vice squad try to fight heroin in a city of about 35,080 crammed into 1.8 square miles on the edge of @entity4			0
he is proud of his team 's work and believes they make a difference , but he does n't lose sight of what they 're up against			0
" i think that drugs as a whole are one of the major problems that are plaguing our society , and aside from all the public intervention that we try to do , the people themselves have to have the will and the desire to want to get past it themselves			2
if they do n't , there 's no public service programs or no magic pill to better the problem			0
" @entity7 and team have had a relatively successful night making a controlled buy with their informant and gaining information to build a case against suspected heroin dealers			0
still , @entity7 knows that each day is a new day , where the effort to end the heroin problem in @entity1 continues			1
" you 're trying to keep them from selling the drugs but it 's really almost temporary , " he says , " you 're constantly pushing back the ocean , basically			1
" @entity246 sees exploding heroin use @entity248 vows to fight rising heroin deaths			0
