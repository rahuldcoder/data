-- the @entity1 launched late thursday afternoon from @entity2 in @entity3 , marking the start of its 39th and final flight			1
" this was a pretty successful day , " said @entity6 , @entity7 's associate administrator for space operations			1
" it was just an amazing event			1
" the six - member crew will deliver a storage module , a science rig and spare parts to the international space station during its 11 - day mission			1
originally scheduled for november , @entity1 's launch had been delayed in order to make repairs to the external tank 's support beams			1
and @entity7 halted its countdown on thursday , at five minutes , because of a computer problem related to safety on the " eastern range			2
" but after a confirmation that all was good to go , the countdown resumed , and the shuttle lifted off about three minutes behind its planned 4:50 p.m. et launch			2
five minutes in , @entity7 's official blog reported " a good separation for solid rocket boosters , " which separated from the main shuttle after pushing the shuttle through @entity37 's lower atmosphere			1
shortly thereafter , the blog reported that the @entity1 and its astronauts were " safely in orbit , " having " performed flawlessly " on its launch			2
@entity6 noted , and video showed , four pieces of foam tearing apart from the shuttle about four minutes into launch			1
but the @entity7 administrator called these incidents " typical " and likely harmless , since they came off " after the area of concern " when the atmosphere was so thin to make its impact negligible			0
the crew is headed by @entity54 , and includes a late addition in @entity56 -- who became the first ever astronaut to fly consecutive missions after he was assigned to take the place of @entity60 , when @entity60 was injured last month in a bicycle accident , according to @entity7			2
prior to thursday 's launch , @entity1 had spent 352 days in orbit , circling the @entity37 5,628 times			1
it has also carried 246 crew members , more than any space vehicle in history			0
" in a way , it 's ... sad to see the last flight , " said astronaut @entity67			0
" it 's such a wonderful vehicle			0
" the last scheduled launch of @entity73 is set for april 19 and will be commanded by @entity74 , the husband of @entity76 rep. @entity75 , who is recovering from being shot last month in @entity77 , @entity78			0
@entity79 is tentatively scheduled to launch during the summer			0
the 30 - year shuttle program should have ended a long time ago , @entity7 's administrator told @entity0 on wednesday			2
" what is not acceptable is the fact that the most powerful nation in the world , the @entity76 , finds itself in a situation that we did n't do the proper planning to have a vehicle in place to replace shuttle when it lands its last landing , " @entity82 said			0
@entity94 hopes that at least two commercial space companies will emerge to transport astronauts to the @entity97			0
this will allow @entity7 to concentrate on building a new heavy - lift rocket capable of leaving lower @entity37 orbit .			0
