@entity0 -- the head of a shipping company recently victimized by pirates off the @entity6 coast told lawmakers tuesday that @entity9 cargo crews should be allowed to arm themselves in response to the rising hijacking threat			1
in april , pirates attacked @entity13 , a @entity9 - flagged cargo ship , but were unable to board			1
@entity15 , head of @entity16 , told a @entity9 @entity18 subcommittee that the owners of @entity9 - flagged " have done all they can within the law to protect our crews			1
" unfortunately , he said , @entity9 vessels are still largely at the mercy of pirates in shipping lanes around the heavily trafficked @entity27			1
" in light of the recent threats to @entity9 merchant mariners , we respectfully request that @entity31 consider clearing the obstacles that currently block ship owners from arming our vessels , " @entity15 said			2
pirates unsuccessfully attempted to board the @entity13 , a cargo vessel owned by @entity15 's company , near the @entity6 coast on april 14			1
the ship was on a humanitarian relief mission at the time , carrying 47,000 tons of food to @entity41 , @entity42			0
pirate leaders later said the attempted hijacking was carried out as revenge after the @entity46 killed three pirates involved in a failed attack on the cargo ship @entity50			1
the slain pirates were holding capt. @entity52 , who was in charge of the @entity50 when it was boarded april 8			1
" we 've heard some suggestions that @entity9 - flagged ship owners have not done enough to protect their vessels , " @entity15 said			2
" that view ... is flat wrong			0
our company adopted every measure recommended by the international maritime organizations and required by the @entity63 's approved security plan for making the vessel a difficult piracy target -- and more			0
" merchant vessels do n't usually carry firearms , he said , but the " @entity50 incident constitutes a game changer			2
... self - proclaimed pirate leaders have now issued direct threats of violence against @entity9 merchant mariners			0
" @entity15 said that @entity9 crews have a right to self - defense under @entity9 laws dating back to 1819 , but " recently enacted @entity80 arms export regulations effectively prohibit the arming of vessels			2
" he also said that ship owners are at risk of " being second - guessed in @entity9 and foreign courts for self - defensive measures that were common in 1819			0
" @entity15 urged congressional leaders to help " bring @entity9 law up to date and give us the legal framework we need to be able to protect ourselves			0
" until then , he said , @entity9 naval escorts or government security teams will be required for @entity9 vessels on high - risk transits			1
@entity15 was joined at the committee hearing by @entity52 , who said the most desirable response would be the establishment of @entity9 military escorts as well as military detachments			1
@entity52 repeated an assertion he made before a separate @entity18 committee last week that arming vessels ' crews could provide an effective deterrent -- but only under certain limited circumstances			2
" unless the root causes of piracy are addressed [ on land ] , piracy will continue to expand and evolve into an even greater threat for @entity9 and foreign seamen , " @entity52 said			1
a @entity112 official testifying at the hearing noted that the ships most vulnerable to attack are those built low to the water with insufficient top speeds			0
ships need to be able to accelerate to " a high rate of speed [ for ] aggressive maneuvering " and should have high walls that are tough for pirates to scale , said @entity125			0
he recommended that ship owners mandate a range of " best practices , " including having fire hoses to spray water over the side of a ship and extra manning for watches during dawn and dusk , when attacks are tougher to detect			0
@entity15 said that the crew of the @entity13 was able to fend off the pirate attack in part by rigging fire hoses to cover the stern of the vessel and " create a virtual flood wall of water coming off the ship			0
" sen. @entity146 , @entity147 , applauded the efforts of the crews on both the @entity50 and the @entity150 " these bandits have to be stopped , " he said at the opening of the hearing			0
" violence and lawlessness will not be tolerated whether on land , in the sky or at sea			0
we have a duty to protect the ships that proudly fly @entity9 's flag			1
