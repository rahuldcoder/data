@entity0 -- a threatened @entity3 attack on @entity5 's nuclear program carries enormous risks for the jewish state , including international isolation , retaliation at home and abroad , and steep economic costs			1
and that 's if it works			0
while @entity3 has the most advanced military in the @entity15 -- including a suspected - but - undeclared nuclear arsenal of its own -- @entity3 analysts say there 's no guarantee that a unilateral strike will roll back an @entity5 program it sees as a threat to its survival			1
yet that 's the choice observers say the jewish state may soon face , and some argue the benefits would outweigh the costs military action would incur			2
a successful raid would set back @entity5 's uranium enrichment effort by " several years , " said @entity33 , the deputy director at the @entity3 @entity34			1
and in a recent op - ed in the @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity3 's former head of military intelligence , argued that previous @entity3 strikes against nuclear installations in @entity41 and @entity42 successfully forced those countries to drop their nuclear programs			1
" this could be the outcome in @entity5 if military action is followed by tough sanctions , stricter international inspections and an embargo on the sale of nuclear components to @entity53 , " @entity37 wrote			2
" @entity5 , like @entity41 and @entity42 before it , will have to recognize that the precedent for military action has been set , and can be repeated			2
" @entity3 authorities argue that if @entity5 develops nuclear weapons , it would trigger a @entity15 arms race among @entity5 's rivals for regional influence			1
" failure to prevent @entity5 from nearing the nuclear threshold will undoubtedly intensify the drive of other states in the region for nuclear weapons , " said @entity61 , director of studies at the @entity3 @entity63			1
" the initial countries , which will attempt to acquire a military nuclear capability , would include @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity41 , @entity75 and in its path , other @entity77 countries			0
" a successful @entity3 attack on @entity5 would eliminate the need for other countries in the region to develop such programs , proponents argue			1
and a severe blow to @entity5 could also weaken its proxies along @entity3 's borders , @entity88 in southern @entity89 and @entity90 in @entity91			1
both groups receive generous @entity5 backing and have staged attacks against @entity3 and @entity3 targets overseas			1
weakening @entity5 could free @entity3 to act more aggressively in combating those groups in the future , according to some @entity3 analysts who fear the groups would become more brazen backed by a nuclear - armed @entity5			1
" if the @entity5 regime weakens as a result of a successful attack , this would undoubtedly have an impact on @entity90 and @entity88 , " said @entity100 , an independent @entity3 commentator on security and strategic affairs			1
he said @entity88 " is likely to suffer a heavy price if it chooses to join the battle and attack @entity3 , " while by knocking out @entity5 's nuclear fuel plants , " @entity3 will show its determination of not allowing @entity5 to acquire a nuclear weapon in hope that it understands the message for the future			1
" but @entity5 has pledged a swift and powerful response to any attack , most likely through missile attacks on @entity3			1
" this may come in the shape of a large number of rockets and missiles fired from @entity5 itself , possibly also by @entity88 and @entity90 , " @entity33 said			2
according to @entity3 military estimates , there are tens of thousands of short - range rockets that could be fired from @entity88 - controlled southern @entity89 and the @entity90 - ruled @entity91 , while a much smaller number of long - range missiles could be launched from @entity5			1
" the whole of @entity3 is vulnerable , " @entity3 deputy prime minister @entity132 warned recently			0
" they are not just going to hit @entity3 soldiers			0
the main aim is at civilian populations			0
" and @entity33 said @entity5 and its allies may respond indirectly as well , by carrying out attacks " against @entity3 and @entity141 targets around the world			1
" in addition , it might try to disrupt the world energy markets and antagonize @entity146 regimes by closing the @entity147 , the choke point for about 20 % of the global oil trade			0
@entity5 says its production of enriched uranium is strictly to fuel civilian power plants and a medical research reactor			2
but the @entity154 and @entity3 accuse it of working toward nuclear weaponry			2
the @entity156 , the @entity158 nuclear watchdog , says it can no longer verify that the @entity5 program is strictly peaceful			2
analysts @entity1 consulted say an @entity3 attack may spur @entity53 to pursue the bomb openly			0
" even if a few nuclear plants are destroyed , it will take several years to rebuild them and give @entity5 legitimacy to say , ' we were attacked by a nuclear power , and now we must defend ourselves , ' " @entity100 told @entity1			1
meanwhile , @entity167 , an @entity5 expert at @entity3 's @entity168 in @entity169 , warns that an attack could lead @entity5 to rally around the flag , bolstering the hand of theocratic government and further setting back the @entity175 hopes for regime change			1
" the regime is likely to use such opportunity to eradicate any form of opposition against it in the country , " @entity167 said			0
and an unsuccessful attack could further tarnish the reputation of an @entity3 military that came under severe criticism at home following its 2006 war with @entity88			0
@entity88 claimed victory after that conflict and enjoyed a surge in regional popularity , while @entity3 commanders came under fire for being inadequately prepared for the fight			0
" during the operation , one needs to take into account that it may fail , that targets will not be destroyed and that a large number of @entity3 planes would be taken down , " @entity33 said			0
in addition , an @entity3 attack conducted without prior notification to the @entity154 could severely strain relations with @entity207 , its leading ally -- especially if @entity154 military or civilian sites in the region were targeted as part of an @entity5 retaliation			1
@entity3 relations with @entity217 and @entity74 , the two @entity146 countries with which it maintains peace treaties , could be hurt			0
a sharp rise in energy prices as the result of a regional conflict would not do @entity3 any favors in the court of global opinion , possibly prompting boycott and sanctions campaigns			0
@entity3 airspace could be closed to commercial traffic , and the country 's lucrative tourism industry would be expected to grind to a halt			2
and a prolonged conflict could result in the closure or slowdown of a variety of industries and businesses costing the @entity3 economy billions of dollars			0
" the economy could lose a year 's growth and even go into negative growth , many will lose their jobs and unemployment will rise , " @entity239 , chairman of an @entity3 investment house and the ceo of the @entity243 consulting firm , recently told @entity3 news portal @entity245			2
couple those prospects with the high cost of rebuilding damaged civilian and military infrastructure , and the price tag of a unilateral strike quickly goes up			0
" the biggest disadvantage of all is war , " @entity100 said			0
" there is always an uncertainty			0
once you start a war , you never know how it is going to finish			0

@entity3 could face isolation and retaliation if it attacks @entity5
a successful raid could set back @entity5 's uranium enrichment effort by several years
@entity3 must balance the risks and benefits of attacking nuclear sites in @entity5
