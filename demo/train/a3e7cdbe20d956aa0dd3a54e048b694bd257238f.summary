@entity0 -- it 's midsummer in @entity0 and it 's raining			1
for once , however , everyone seems very pleased about the matter			0
londoners are used to summer showers but they 'd never seen anything like this as a helicopter hovered over the @entity11 , scattering 100,000 poems on to the delighted crowds below			1
the " @entity26 " is the idea of a @entity16 arts collective called @entity17 and follows similar stunts in cities that have suffered from aerial bombardment during wartime from @entity22 to @entity23 , @entity24 to @entity25			1
@entity28 's @entity27 says the forthcoming @entity29 made @entity0 the perfect target			1
" this time we have included one poet from each of the countries participating in the @entity29 so when you see all of these poems in the sky what you are seeing is the story , the literature of all these different places			1
" but logistics threaten to replace lyricism among @entity47 's list of priorities			0
" i have become a weather specialist			0
i have to calculate wind direction , the wind speed as well as the rules of civil aviation			0
" in the event , @entity47 's command of wind speed proves inadequate and the first batch of poems is carried away from the crowd , sending people scurrying through side streets in pursuit of poetry			1
eventually , the chopper moves to a more suitable position from which the delightful deluge can hit its mark			0
soon @entity69 are full of laughter as poem - baggers run to and fro , leaping in the air and diving on the grass to snare their quarry			0
if Â £ 50 notes had replaced the bookmark - sized poems there could barely have been a happier response			1
the " @entity26 " marks the beginning of what is being described as the biggest ever gathering of international poets			1
the event is called " @entity84 " -- named after @entity85 , known in @entity87 mythology as the spiritual home of poetry , the stamping ground of the lyricist @entity91 and the hang - out for the @entity93			0
the event has attracted poets of all ages , continents and literary stature -- from @entity100 @entity99 ( @entity101 ) and @entity102 ( @entity103 ) to @entity104 ( @entity105 ) to @entity106 ( @entity107 )			2
many arrived in @entity0 with incredible stories to tell			1
@entity110 was court poet to @entity112 's @entity111			2
when his disillusionment with the regime became too much to bear he fled across the @entity115 carrying seventy of his poems			2
he now lives in @entity118 separated from his family but free to express his thoughts about his native country			2
@entity84 is part of the @entity124 's " @entity123 , " in turn part of the @entity127 , designed to spread the @entity29 fervor beyond sport to the arts			1
londoners at the " @entity26 " embraced this idea			1
" it 's very important because not everyone has tickets for the @entity136 so events like this mean everyone can take part			0
" " a lot of the things that are in the @entity136 are free and you do n't have to pay an extortionate amount to go and see a celebration when you 've got a thousand people here having fun and all it is is poems falling from the sky , which is something that does n't happen every day			2
" a beaming among the crowds turned out to be @entity153 -- @entity154 at @entity0 's @entity155 , who was proud that his countrymen had staged the @entity26			1
" you feel like a little child running to catch one of those lovely poems and as you know @entity16 is the country of poets with two @entity162 -- both of them poets			1
it 's the best thing we can bring to this country in order to celebrate the @entity136			2
" as the deluge of verse continued , people on the ground began to get in touch with their own inner poet			0
the area was soon awash with whimsical people reading aloud to each other			0
a team of cleaners was on hand to gather up any mess -- in the event most of the poems were gathered up and taken home by those who found them -- and any poems which fell in the nearby @entity188 were designed to dissolve , leaving no trace of poetry on the ground			0
but it was clear that poetry had left its mark on many who witnessed the curious event			0
people like @entity198 , who told us : " poetry is life			0
poetry is absolutely everything ! "			0
