-- it was one of the worst passenger ship disasters since the sinking of the @entity4 a century ago			0
on january 13 , the @entity5 was sailing a few hundred meters off the rocky @entity7 coastline of the island of @entity9			1
the ship , nearly the length of three football fields , rammed into a bed of rocks around 9:45 p.m. within minutes , the massive vessel began to tilt , as water rushed into the engine rooms through a gash some 50 meters long			0
the crippled ship , without power or propulsion , drifted onward a few miles before turning toward the small harbor on the island and coming to rest on rocks nearby			0
thirty - two people from eight countries -- both crew and passengers -- died			0
many more barely escaped in the hours after the @entity5 came to rest on its side , tilting ever closer to the sea			1
countless survivors told @entity0 the same story -- they had received little or no safety training after boarding the ship , whether in @entity35 several days earlier or at a port near @entity37 just hours before the disaster			1
international guidelines at the time recommended a safety drill within 24 hours of embarkation , but the disaster came well before that period had elapsed for the 600 who stepped on board in @entity37			2
multiple passengers who spoke to @entity0 and other media said they did n't know where to gather during the emergency			0
the common refrain : it was chaos , every passenger for him or herself			0
some said that when they asked crew members for help , they got blank stares			2
covering a cruise ship disaster nearly six months later , lessons learned that night have brought changes to safety and evacuation procedures in the cruise industry			1
carnival , the parent line of @entity68 , and several other cruise lines now require safety instruction , referred to as muster drills , before leaving port			1
the new muster policy consists of 12 specific emergency instructions , which include providing information on when and how to don a life jacket , where to muster and what to expect if there is an evacuation of the ship			0
last year , nearly 16 million cruise bookings were made worldwide			2
about three - quarters of them were from the @entity83 , according to the industry group @entity84 , which represents 26 cruise lines , including the world 's largest , @entity66 and @entity87			1
but the @entity5 disaster cast a shadow on a rapidly expanding industry that maintains it is one of the safest modes of transportation			1
it has also focused attention on how some international cruise companies operate , registering their ships in countries where there may be weak regulations or where international rules are poorly enforced , but at the same time headquartering their companies in the @entity83 and @entity103			1
at a @entity106 hearing in the aftermath of the @entity5 disaster , there was tough questioning about the practice			1
@entity111 sen. @entity110 of @entity112 , one of the strongest voices at the congressional hearing , spoke to @entity0 about the cruise lines			1
" they just know how to work the system and they work it very well and always to their advantage , " he said			0
@entity110 and other critics of the industry say that cruise lines that are headquartered in the @entity83 but have their ships registered elsewhere are getting a free ride on the backs of @entity83 taxpayers , placing demands on federal agencies such as @entity129 , @entity130 and the @entity131 , which are charged with oversight when those ships enter and leave @entity83 ports			1
" they do n't reimburse the @entity131 , they do n't pay taxes that will help with these 20 federal agencies that are watching over them in various ways and whose services they use , or might use , " @entity110 told @entity0			1
in the five years before 2010 , @entity66 , the company that owns @entity68 , paid 1.1 % tax on $ 11.3 billion in profits			0
leading @entity83 - based companies like @entity66 often register their ships in foreign countries under what the industry calls " flags of convenience			1
" for example , @entity66 registers the majority of its ships in @entity154 and is incorporated there			0
its headquarters is in the @entity83			2
despite repeated requests , @entity66 did not grant @entity0 an interview			0
however , @entity159 , a spokesman for the @entity84 , the industry group that represents carnival and other major cruise lines , told @entity0 , " there 's a variety of components that go into that decision [ about where to register a ship ] and it 's individualized to a ship 's owner			1
it 's individualized across maritime sectors			0
" @entity172 added , " are there some fees and taxation considerations that go into that ? certainly			2
" the @entity177 , which represents mariners around the world , is highly critical of " foreign flagging , " saying on its website , " cheap registration fees , low or no taxes and freedom to employ cheap labor are the motivating factors behind a ship owner 's decision to ' flag out			2
' " however , the @entity84 maintains its members pay plenty of port and other fees in the @entity83			1
" we pay a wide array of fees , duties and we pay all of the taxes we are required to pay , " @entity159 told @entity0			1
@entity110 said that while more regulation of the industry is needed , achieving that will be difficult because of the industry 's lobbying in @entity205			1
according to @entity159 , the @entity84 spent nearly $ 10 million on lobbying between 2004 and 2011			0
the @entity206 , which is tasked with the international supervision of passenger ships , has also been under fire in the wake of the disaster			2
under the @entity213 , known as @entity213 , there are many mandated standards for ship operators , but critics -- including @entity83 lawmakers -- point to the fact that there are also many codes , guidelines and recommendations that are voluntary			2
additionally , there are no unified standards for reporting incidents at sea			0
the @entity206 does keep records of incidents reported voluntarily by ship operators , but does not maintain a public database of that information			0
the @entity206 has promised to address the issues raised by critics once the @entity237 authorities ' accident report is published			0
so far , its @entity238 , which met five months after the sinking of the @entity5 , has issued only voluntary guidance			2
that new guidance includes the introduction of onboard stability computers , new free - fall lifeboats and the establishment of appropriate minimum levels for staffing qualified mariners on board each passenger ship			2
bloggers and industry observers , meanwhile , have tried to fill any gaps left by the @entity206 by archiving incidents , relying on information from media reports and passengers			0
@entity257 , a @entity258 professor , has written four books on the cruise industry and maintains a database online			1
at the congressional hearings in march , he told the @entity106 committee there were more than a dozen incidents of passenger ships sinking and 99 ships running aground between 1973 and 2011			0
@entity257 also testified that 79 ships experienced fires between 1990 and 2011			0
even so , given the rapid expansion of the industry , the number of fatalities has been low			0
the industry is now worth $ 25 billion a year			0
most of its customers are @entity83 , with 13 million @entity83 bookings in 2011			2
the industry also is tapping into new markets , especially in @entity280			0
in the spring , a few months after the @entity5 disaster , @entity68 released a statement that said bookings were robust			1
meanwhile , the @entity84 maintains the industry is committed to ensuring the safety of passengers			1
but industry insiders and regulators say another serious accident could do irreparable damage to the cruise lines ' reputation -- and reinforce existing calls for more rigorous international regulation .			1
