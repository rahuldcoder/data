-- @entity2 fuel - injected the beat of rock and roll in the mid- 1970s with a frenetic tempo			0

the @entity23 reported that he was 62			0
@entity11 was reportedly battling cancer when he died			1
with their racing - pulse beat and disparaging , cynical lyrics that were combined with oddly florid but loud guitar riffs , the @entity7 kicked off a music and counterculture movement in @entity31 that quickly spread to @entity32			1
it came echoing back from @entity34 in variations from groups like the @entity37 and the @entity38			2
glue - sniffing darkness their debut album , " @entity7 , " left little doubt about the direction of the new rock style with song titles like : " @entity47 , " " @entity48 , " " @entity40			1
" not all of their lyrics were dark			0
some were playful ruckus , but most of them seemed to come " from a sullen adolescent basement of the mind , " as the @entity23 put it			0
their head - banging rock cut like a machete into the candy - glazed , infatuated glam pop of the time that was vaulting the band @entity63 to @entity65 - like elevations			2
a flock of similar kissable , bell - bottomed groups were riding their coattails			0
then punk rock slammed into the party head - on			1
clashing with glam pop the @entity7 ' black leather , torn jeans and canvas sneakers clashed with the rainbow satin , sequins and platform shoes that had overtaken youth culture			2
the everyday heroes the @entity7 sang about had dumped surfboards and disco gyrations for lives as pogo - ing punk rockers in the urban grit of places like @entity87 and @entity31			1
the @entity7 were practically the house band of the hole - in - the - wall rock bar @entity89 on lower @entity91 's @entity90 , a neighbor to skid row			1
other @entity95 punk and new wave acts like @entity97 , the @entity98 and @entity99 joined them there			2

" " the @entity7 got back to basics : simple , speedy , stripped - down rock and roll songs			1
@entity109 , guitar , bass , drums			0
no makeup , no egos , no light shows , no nonsense			0
" @entity11 said the intention was innovation with a statement			2
" it was n't just music in the @entity7 : it was an idea			1
it was bringing back a whole feel that was missing in rock music -- it was a whole push outwards to say something new and different , " he said			2

it was during the morbid wake of @entity140 , when the @entity141 was beginning to cement @entity142 into a communist bloc			0
some of the @entity7 ' music reflects that @entity146 background with songs like " @entity148 " and the album " @entity149			1
" @entity11 built his music career on the band but handed over the drum sticks in 1978			1
