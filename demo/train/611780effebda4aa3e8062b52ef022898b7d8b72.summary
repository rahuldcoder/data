-- the top - secret federal court that oversees government surveillance on friday reauthorized the @entity4 's program that collects data on nearly every phone call in the @entity7			1
the three - month renewal by the @entity9 is the first since two conflicting court opinions last month on the legality of the program			1
revealed publicly in leaks last year by former @entity4 contractor @entity15 , the program is at the center of the surveillance debate in the @entity7			1
critics say it violates privacy rights of @entity7 whose data is collected even though there is n't any suspicion that they pose a security threat			2
the @entity4 and its supporters say the bulk collection authority is crucial to uncovering potential terrorists who have n't yet come to the attention of national security officials			1
the telephone data program , covered under @entity33 of the @entity34 , has been authorized 36 times over the past seven years , the nation 's top intelligence official said on friday			1
president @entity36 said recently that he is contemplating making modest changes following an independent review of the initiative			0
one possible change would remove the electronic surveillance effort from the @entity4 but requiring telecommunications companies , or perhaps a new quasi-government agency , to collect the data			1
" the intelligence community continues to be open to modifications to this program that would provide additional privacy and civil liberty protections while still maintaining its operational benefits , " @entity45 , spokesman for director of national intelligence @entity46 said			2
a federal judge in @entity56 last month called the program almost " orwellian " and said it was likely unconstitutional			0
days later another federal judge in @entity59 , in a separate challenge to the program , said it was lawful			0
the @entity62 on friday filed an appeal of the @entity56 ruling			0
the @entity65 , which brought the @entity59 suit , is appealing that decision			0
split decisions will likely set the stage for legal wrangling over the course of the coming year that could ultimately result in a @entity74 case			0
@entity4 wo n't say if it 's ' spying ' on @entity76 @entity0 's @entity77 contributed to this report .			2
