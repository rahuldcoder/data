@entity0 -- immigration groups , @entity4 surrogates , the media and the @entity6 have a message for @entity9 voters , who some say could swing the election because they are heavily represented in four battleground states -- @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			1
here 's the message : vice presidential hopeful @entity18 is anti-latino , and his immigration views are simplistic , intolerant and punitive			1
really ? someone should tell that to the anti-immigrant group @entity23 , which advocates not only an end to illegal immigration ( and there is nothing wrong with that ) but also a dramatic reduction in legal immigration to pre- 1965 levels ( there is a lot wrong with that )			2
it is the views of groups such as this -- which sadly have a lot of influence on the @entity41 -- that can genuinely be called simplistic , intolerant and punitive			0
so why does @entity23 list @entity18 's " career grade " in @entity45 as a " c " ? @entity18 's grade puts him in the bottom 10 % of all current @entity41 members of @entity45 , according to @entity50 , the group 's founder and ceo			1
the nicest thing that @entity50 could find to say about @entity18 after the congressman from @entity55 joined the @entity41 ticket was that @entity18 " does n't seem to have put a lot of thought into immigration policy and does n't seem to have deep ideological reasons for his poor immigration record			1
that 's a ringing endorsement , is n't it ? if someone like @entity50 thinks you have a " poor " record on immigration , it means you have both a heart and a brain			2
specifically , @entity50 is miffed at the @entity55 @entity41 for not signing onto enough immigration enforcement bills and for co-sponsoring -- over the last 10 years -- various " amnesties to give illegal aliens a path to citizenship			0
@entity18 's record bears out he has over the years co-sponsored or voted for a number of bills that would have given legal status to illegal immigrants			1
@entity50 tries to look on what he considers the bright side by suggesting that @entity18 might be going nativist because lately he has n't sponsored " any bills that would reward illegal aliens or increase legal foreign workers " and because @entity18 's website " takes a fairly strong stand against amnesties			1
" he also likes it that @entity18 opposes the @entity92 , which would have given legal status to illegal immigrants who attend college or join the military , but he wishes that @entity18 had n't expressed " sympathy " for the young people who stand to benefit from such a proposal			1
as @entity50 sees it , much of the problem with @entity18 on immigration is that he hangs out with a bad crowd			2
in the early 1990s , @entity18 worked for @entity102 , a @entity104 - based think tank run by @entity105 , a former @entity106 education secretary and current @entity1 contributor , and @entity108 , the former congressman and @entity106 housing secretary			2
both @entity105 and @entity108 had pro-immigration views and warned fellow @entity41 not to get on the wrong side of demographics by alienating @entity9 voters			0
that 's the message that @entity105 and @entity108 took to @entity115 in 1994 where -- along with their friend , conservative columnist @entity117 -- they angered fellow @entity41 by taking a public stand against @entity121 , a dreadful ballot initiative that threatened to cut off education , welfare and nonemergency health care to illegal immigrants			0
the picture that emerges is that @entity18 's views on immigration are complicated and hard to pin down			1
he wants to secure the borders , but he has in the past voted for proposals that would have given select groups of illegal immigrants who are already here -- such as agricultural workers -- a pathway to earned legal status			1
he also supports using temporary guest workers to offset labor shortages in some industries			2
in short , in a party where the loudest voices on immigration seem to belong to those with the most infantile views ( see : rep. @entity145 , @entity146 , who in 2006 suggested fortifying the @entity106 - @entity17 border with electrical wire because " we do this all the time with livestock " ) , @entity18 seems to be a grown - up and a pragmatist			1
for instance , his support for guest workers suggests he understands there are jobs that @entity106 wo n't do and must be done by foreign workers			0
also , while he is against illegal immigration , there is n't much evidence of him demeaning or demonizing the immigrants themselves			0
this is not good news for @entity6 who would dearly love to paint @entity18 as anti-immigrant and anti-latino			1
say , are they sure they 're not talking about president @entity4 ? his record on immigration is atrocious , capped off by a staggering 1.5 million deportations , the dividing of hundreds of thousands of families , the placement of thousands of @entity106 - born children in foster care once their parents have been deported , and one falsehood after another intended to obscure all this			2
with such a record , it 's hard to trust the administration and believe it is suddenly trying to do the right thing with the election - year giveaway of deferred action for so - called " dream - ers " -- young illegal immigrants who would have benefited from the @entity92			2
in contrast , @entity18 has n't done anything wrong or been in a position to make bad policy			0
all he seems to be guilty of is being affiliated with a party that has a poor record on immigration			0
now that could change in the days to come as he moves closer to @entity198 on immigration			0
but , at the moment , he 's not trying to deport anyone			0
all he wants to do is help evict someone -- the current occupant of 1600 @entity204 @entity18 needs to clarify his immigration views			1
and if it turns out they 're complicated and unpredictable and nuanced and do n't look as if they came out of a cookie cutter , then all the better			0
most @entity106 feel the same way			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213			0

@entity213 : @entity6 paint @entity18 as down on immigration , but he 's complicated
he says nativist group gave @entity220 " on record ; he 's voted for laws giving some legal status
he says @entity18 seems to see use of letting temporary workers stay for agricultural work , etc.
@entity213 : he may edge toward *stricter* views for campaign , but his votes so far show nuance
