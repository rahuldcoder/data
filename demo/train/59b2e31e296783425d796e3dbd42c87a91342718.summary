-- thanks to a crop of how - to dating shows , such as @entity4 's " @entity3 " and @entity6 's " @entity5 , " more people are reaching out to matchmakers , making an age - old art fashionable again			1
back in 19th - century @entity13 -- around the time of " @entity12 " -- women dreaded visits from the village matchmaker and longed to choose their own men			2
today , real - life dating experts are in high demand			0
" @entity3 " star @entity20 says her off - screen business , @entity22 , is growing just as fast as her tv series , which , in its third season premiere , increased viewership by 30 percent , according to @entity26			1
it 's great having more clients , @entity20 said , though there 's more dross to sort through			2
" we 're on the map , everyone knows the brand , but it takes 30 to 45 guys until we find a real guy , " she said			0
" crazy people come in [ out of ] the woodwork			0
" and while certain aspects of her club have been sensationalized for tv -- like having millionaires pick their dates out of a room full of men or women looking to date them -- @entity20 tells it like it is , whether or not the cameras are rolling			0
" i 'll tell [ clients ] off			0
i 'll say , ' you want to be 80 [ and alone ] in the nursing home ? ' " " @entity5 " features @entity55 , chief executive officer at @entity56 , a matchmaking service his mother @entity58 -- who also appears on the show -- founded more than 20 years ago			1
on the show , @entity55 works closely with single women who he says " need an objective third party to give them constructive feedback that can help them find what they 're looking for			0
" there are many people looking for answers , especially young people with nowhere else to turn , @entity55 said			0
about half of the 20,000 people who applied to be on his new spin - off " @entity75 " were younger than 21 , he said			1
hiring a matchmaker can be pricey			0
some services charge thousands of dollars for one - on - one consultations			0
however , many matchmakers will list you in their database for a smaller fee			0
the success of the shows has rubbed off on the matchmaking industry			1
despite her general dislike for " @entity3 , " @entity86 said the @entity4 hit , which debuted in 2008 , is somewhat responsible for spiking interest and boosting her client base			1
her company , @entity91 , has seen a 41 percent increase since these programs found a place on cable tv			1
one client , a former bachelor from @entity98 , @entity99 , contacted @entity100 after his daughter inadvertently introduced him to " @entity3			1
" " his teenage daughter was watching it in the living room , and when he walked in , he heard what the show was about and took interest in the art of matchmaking , " @entity86 said			1

whether it aired about six years too soon , or just settled in to an unfortunate time slot , the series was canceled after one season because of disappointing ratings			2
despite " @entity118 's " missed mark , @entity110 plans to give tv another shot			2
she 's is in the planning stages of her own reality show to teach women to be better daters			2
" putting that show on the air and going forward with more shows on the air , people are coming to understand what the business is more , " @entity110 said			1

@entity146 , who met her husband of 25 years through the personals , said it 's important to get past the stigma that comes with hiring a matchmaker			2
some people have an " if it happens , it happens " attitude when it comes to finding love , she said			0
" but did you get to [ be successful at work ] because ' if it happens , it happens ' ? did n't you have to plan and put time into it ? think about it			0
" in addition to educating viewers about how to find love and sustain healthy relationships , matchmaking shows have helped to eliminate the stigma often associated with hiring a matchmaker , said @entity20 , who met her fianc√© through her own service			1
