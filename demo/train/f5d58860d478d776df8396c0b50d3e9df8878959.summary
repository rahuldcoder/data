@entity0 -- july 1 , 2014 , the 17th anniversary of @entity0 's return to @entity5 rule , is set to be a hot , possibly stormy day			1
but the suffocating weather wo n't stop pro-democracy @entity7 -- possibly hundreds of thousands of them -- from filling the streets , beginning at 3 p.m today			1
activists are openly challenging @entity12 's vision for the city 's political future , and they believe the public is on their side			1
in a recent unofficial referendum organized by pro-democracy activist group @entity18 with @entity19 ( @entity20 ) , 787,767 @entity7 voted in support of free elections for the city 's next leader			1

before the vote began ten days ago , organizers were hoping around 100,000 people would participate			0
@entity37 , a co-organiser of @entity20 , said @entity7 were " using this opportunity to at least show @entity39 how determined we are for universal suffrage			1
" @entity0 's former second - highest - ranked official , @entity42 , echoed the sentiment in an interview with @entity1 on monday			1
" whatever @entity39 says in public now i think it can hardly afford to ignore the voices of 780,000 people			2
" but the @entity5 government 's reaction was decidedly more frosty , with the government declaring the poll " illegal " and its results " invalid " even before the ballots were counted			2
@entity53 , @entity0 's secretary for justice , has previously said there is no legal basis for the vote			1
@entity53 , as well a number of other , pro-establishment voices , declined to speak to @entity1			0
a recent @entity5 state media editorial said the poll was a " farce			0
" searches for the referendum have also been heavily censored on the @entity5 internet			2
showdown over democracy the city 's pro-democracy camp wants fully democratic elections for the city 's next leader , while @entity12 insists it will only allow elections in which it gets to approve the nominees			2
specifically , @entity39 says it will only allow candidates who " love @entity12			2
" the @entity18 referendum outlined three plans to reform the upcoming election			2
all three plans proposed that candidates be nominated publicly , regardless of whether the candidates have @entity39 's blessing			1
42 % of participants picked a proposal by the @entity83 , which said candidates for @entity0 's chief executive should be nominated by the public , and conditions such as requiring candidates to " love @entity12 " should not be allowed			1
another question asked if @entity0 's legislature should veto any nomination process that did not meet " international standards			1
" this was overwhelmingly approved in the referendum			2
the high numbers are a sign that @entity7 are not about to back down , said @entity37			2
" we have an offer and we have a baseline , and this is the thing we will give to the ( @entity0 government ) , " he told @entity1			2
" i think a responsible government must respond to that			0
i can not see any reason for refusing to meet with us			0
" but if negotiations fail , and no progress is made through legal means , then the group is prepared to disrupt the city to make their statement heard			0
as a final strategy , @entity37 says his group may marshal 10,000 people to sit and peacefully block traffic in downtown @entity0 as a way to pressure @entity39 into allowing @entity0 to exercise " genuine universal suffrage			1
" " we will only resort to the civil disobedience action as our last resort , " said @entity37			0
" only after exhausting all the legal means and still fail to achieve our goals will we resort to civil disobedience			0
" grassroots support the city is politicized like at no other time in its recent past			0
while the july 1st anniversary of the handover has always brought demonstrators out onto @entity0 's hot , crowded streets , often numbering over 100,000 , this year protests are expected to be super-sized			1
many hong kongers are enraged after the recent publication of a white paper by the @entity5 government which declares @entity39 's " comprehensive jurisdiction " over @entity0			1
read more : alarm in @entity0 at @entity5 white paper affirming @entity39 control @entity42 said the white paper violates the " one country , two systems " principle enshrined in @entity0 's constitutional @entity144 , which lets the city maintain high autonomy despite being a part of @entity12			1
the white paper " makes it quite clear that whatever autonomy we enjoy is for the central government to give and to take away at its pleasure , " she said			0
" i think this has caused real concern			0
" the inflammatory document came days after 100,000 people showed up to an annual candlelit vigil for the victims of the 1989 @entity161 crackdown			0
" ( the white paper ) has spectacularly backfired , it 's made people even more angry , " @entity42 said			0
what 's next ? the situation in @entity0 is volatile			1
some activists fear a crackdown on freedoms by the @entity5 central government , and others look nervously to the possibility of unrest at tomorrow 's mass protest			0
@entity174 , director of the @entity175 , an independent organization that monitors governance in the territory , said the future is incredibly difficult to assess because no one is totally sure what @entity12 's officials are thinking			2
" we 're in a situation where we have a new regime in power and much more volatile circumstances , and we have groups that are much more separatist , challenging the legitimacy of the central government altogether , " he said			0
" in these circumstances , it is extremely difficult to tell what the central government intends and what they 're thinking and how they 'll react			0
" but despite the uncertainty , @entity0 's democracy supporters remain hopeful			1
" i do not think @entity39 has made up its mind on universal suffrage , so let 's see what happens in the months ahead , " said @entity42			1
" the government stance has a little bit softened in the last few days			0
there 's a chance there , " said @entity37			0
" after ( the july 1 protest ) , we may be able to see whether there 's any change in the stance of the @entity5 government			0
