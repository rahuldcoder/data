-- a defiant @entity1 calls the @entity2 " a band of hypocrites and bullies " in a written statement the longtime @entity8 co-owner sent to the media through one of his lawyers			1
he also wrote that the @entity2 needs to examine its own " discriminatory practices " rather than try to take away his personal property			2
" we have to fight for the rights of all @entity16			0
we have to fight these despicable monsters , " @entity1 wrote in the statement , provided to @entity0 by @entity18			0
in @entity1 's 420 - plus word statement , he says the @entity2 has been able to " exact its reign of terror " through revenues from the fans			1
he slams new commissioner @entity24 , who has worked for the league since 1992 but took over the top spot in february			1
@entity1 said @entity24 is " focusing his energy on violating my rights , attempting to take my property , and signing autographs for @entity31			1
" talking to @entity32 about the @entity34 accusation at the halftime of an @entity2 finals game between the @entity37 and the @entity38 , @entity24 said he had " no idea what he 's talking about			1
" " this is about @entity1 and his conduct , " the commissioner said			2
" and if he wants to litigate , he 'll litigate			0
" @entity1 said the @entity2 has been sued many times for discrimination			2
he said @entity24 and the @entity2 need to look at their own conduct and the conduct of the other 29 owners in the league and they are centering their attention on him to " draw attention away from their own discriminatory and repulsive conduct			2
" the statement comes as a source with knowledge of the situation told @entity0 that @entity1 's estranged wife , @entity60 , intends to ask a @entity62 probate court on wednesday morning to " verify her standing " as the head of the family trust and rule that she had the right to sell the @entity8			1
referring to this apparent disagreement between the @entity34 about what to do with the @entity8 , @entity24 said the @entity2 is planning to step back and let the situation play itself out			1

technically , a family trust owns the @entity8			0
last month , two sources with detailed knowledge of the situation told @entity0 that two neurologists have deemed @entity1 to be mentally incapacitated			1
according to one of the sources , there is a provision in the @entity1 family trust that says if either @entity1 or @entity60 become mentally incapacitated , then the other becomes the sole trustee			1
@entity1 is mentally sound , another lawyer , @entity91 , told @entity0 's @entity92			1
" it strikes me as totally incredible to argue that this man -- i talk to him every day -- is incapable of making decisions and is mentally incompetent , " @entity91 said on tuesday afternoon			0
" and i do n't believe any court is going to make a finding to the contrary			0
" @entity1 initially vowed to fight the sale and filed a lawsuit against the @entity2 , then said he was going along with the sale -- until monday , when he again pulled his support			1
" from the onset , i did not want to sell the @entity8			0
i have worked for 33 years to build the team , " @entity1 said			2
@entity1 , 80 , has been embroiled in controversy since a recording of a conversation with his friend @entity109 surfaced			0

the comments , first posted on @entity31 , sparked outrage among @entity2 players , executives and fans			0
