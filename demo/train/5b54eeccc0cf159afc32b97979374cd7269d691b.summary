why it 's so difficult to solve @entity1 's gun problem can somewhat be explained within 20 seconds of the 17th episode of " @entity4 's " eighth season			1
@entity5 and @entity6 are trapped in a bank vault and after some silly banter , which leads to a ridiculous scuffle , @entity6 ends up grabbing a gun and pointing it at @entity5 : @entity5 : look , @entity6 , c'mon you do n't know how to use that thing			1
@entity6 : oh really ? what if i hold it sideways like a black guy			2
@entity5 : whoa whoa , c'mon man , take it easy , all right ? i do n't want any trouble			1
it 's the typical , racially charged bit of satire that defines the animated series , with the added irony being that holding a gun sideways is actually more of a sign of not knowing " how to use that thing " than holding it correctly			2
that 's because aiming and thus hitting your target is harder with a side grip			0
nonetheless , since the mid- 1990s pantomiming holding a gun sideways has been the default pose struck by the misinformed who want to appear intimidating and / or cool			0
each time a gun rights advocate talks about the @entity39 and hunting , i think about the sheep holding their guns to the side			2
when it comes to the conversation on guns , we must remember one size does not fit all			1
there are at least two @entity52 , and one of them is likely populated with folks imitating fictional characters in gangster movies -- unaware that , reportedly , film directors instructed actors to hold the prop that way so they could capture the face and the gun in the same frame			0
except for the tens of thousands who are wounded or killed each year in our city streets			0
sadly , that 's all too real			0
and by city streets i mean where predominantly blacks and @entity73 live			0
pretending the weekly gun violence that grips places such as @entity76 and @entity77 does n't run along racial lines is counterproductive			2
just as grouping mass school shootings perpetrated by the mentally ill with gang violence is counterproductive			1
each time we link an @entity82 with @entity84 statistics about @entity85 , we move further from addressing either problem			1
those who are truly concerned about the regularly underreported bloodshed in urban @entity1 must resist piggybacking the media coverage that swirls around the camera - ready anomalies like @entity91			1
@entity6 making a joke about holding a handgun sideways has very little if anything to do with background checks or mental health care			0
but it does highlight the shortfalls of public education and the war on drugs			0
it shines a light on whom the @entity104 is not advocating for , as no licensed instructor would tell a student to hold the weapon that way			0
instead of constantly searching for sweeping laws that approach all gun violence as one in the same , we need to recognize that the comedic bit in episode 17 of the eighth season of " @entity4 " has nothing to do with @entity118			1
until we get there in our talks , all we will ever have is talk .			2

the @entity123 explores the role of guns in the @entity1
one size does not fit all when it comes to talking about guns , @entity127 says
we ca n't link school shootings with @entity84 statistics about @entity85 , he says
