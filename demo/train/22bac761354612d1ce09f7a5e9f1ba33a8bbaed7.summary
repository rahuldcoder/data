-- president @entity1 commended the progress of african - americans in a speech on the 100th anniversary of the @entity6 , but said there was still much work to be done			1
president @entity1 addresses the @entity6 in @entity9 thursday night on the group 's 100th anniversary			1
speaking at the organization 's annual convention in @entity9 , the city where the organization was founded , @entity1 evoked symbols of the civil rights movement to describe the @entity6 's influence on race relations in the @entity19			1
" what we celebrate tonight is not simply the journey the @entity6 has traveled , but the journey that we , as @entity3 , have traveled over the past 100 years , " @entity1 told a star - studded crowd that included music producer @entity26 and poet @entity27 , to name a few			1
but @entity1 said " the pain of discrimination is still felt in @entity19 " among african - americans , latinos and @entity33 - @entity3			1
" even as we inherit extraordinary progress that can not be denied ; even as we marvel at the courage and determination of so many plain folks -- we know that too many barriers still remain , " he said			0
watch @entity1 's speech to the @entity6 " what is required to overcome today 's barriers is the same as was needed then			1
the same sense of urgency			0
the same sense of sacrifice			0
the same willingness to do our part for ourselves and one another that has always defined @entity19 at its best			2
" the " steepest " barriers are not prejudice and discrimination , he said , but the " structural inequalities that our nation 's legacy of discrimination has left behind			0
" @entity1 highlighted some of his administration 's policies as examples of how the government is attempting to break down the barriers of inequity			2
" these are barriers we are beginning to tear down by rewarding work with an expanded tax credit ; making housing more affordable ; and giving ex-offenders a second chance			0
these are barriers that we are targeting through our @entity75 , and through promise neighborhoods that build on @entity78 's success with the @entity79 , " he said			0
" when it comes to higher education , we are making college and advanced training more affordable , and strengthening community colleges that are a gateway to so many with an initiative that will prepare students not only to earn a degree but find a job when they graduate ; an initiative that will help us meet the goal i have set of leading the world in college degrees by 2020 , " he said			0
@entity1 said the economy has made progress difficult , but assured the audience that his administration was working to " lay a new foundation for growth and prosperity " for future generations			1
" one pillar of this new foundation is health insurance reform that cuts costs , makes quality health coverage affordable for all , and closes health care disparities in the process			0
another pillar is energy reform that makes clean energy profitable , freeing @entity19 from the grip of foreign oil , putting people to work upgrading low - income homes , and creating jobs that can not be outsourced , " he said			1
the president also talked about the need " to recapture the same sense of responsibility in @entity121 and in our own lives " that propelled the civil rights movement			0
" in particular , when it comes to education , we need better standards in our schools , excellent teachers in our classrooms , and parents doing their part to ensure that all our children can succeed , no matter what their race , faith or station in life , " a senior administration official said			1
he urged families to help children with their homework , to put away the @entity144 and encourage them to be more than " ballers and rappers " " we have to say to our children , yes , if you 're @entity3 , the odds of growing up amid crime and gangs are higher			2
yes , if you live in a poor neighborhood , you will face challenges that someone in a wealthy suburb does not			0
but that 's not a reason to get bad grades , that 's not a reason to cut class , that 's not a reason to give up on your education and drop out of school , " he said , eliciting applause from the audience			0
" no one has written your destiny for you			0
your destiny is in your hands -- and do n't you forget that , " he said			0
the excitement over @entity1 was in stark contrast to the reception of former president @entity175 , who had a strained relationship with the @entity6 and declined the group 's invitations for five years			1
@entity175 spoke before the @entity6 in 2000 , during his first run for the presidency , but he did not make another appearance until 2006			2
but now , even though there 's a new president and a new dynamic , there are still some questions as to whether the @entity6 and @entity1 share the same approach			1
" i think his big challenge now is going to be in talking to them about issues that have concerned him in the past , like problems with teen pregnancy and black - on - black crime , that the @entity6 has n't been that eager to deal with , " said @entity194 , a columnist for the @entity196 editorial board			2
earlier this week , @entity197 , the first @entity3 - @entity3 chair of the @entity198 , addressed the @entity6 and urged its members to take another look at the @entity201			1
@entity197 on thursday reiterated that message , telling @entity0 , " there 's a historic and inextricable link between the @entity201 and @entity3			1
in fact , @entity201 helped found the @entity6 back in 1909			1
" the @entity201 , however , has not received more than 11 percent of the @entity3 - @entity3 vote since 1996			2
@entity1 received 95 percent of the black vote in the 2008 election			2
according to a national poll conducted in may , african - americans really like @entity1 , but more and more feel that race relations have not gotten better since he took office			2
in december , 51 percent of african - americans said @entity1 's election marks the start of a new era of better race relations , according to a @entity0 / @entity219 poll			0
in may , that number dropped to 44 percent			0
the historic election of the first @entity3 - @entity3 president in the @entity19 highlights the @entity6 's role in fighting for equality and opportunity			1
@entity6 president @entity226 said that while @entity1 's presidency is a big milestone , it 's just the next step on a long road			1
" this is a big step that we 've taken , having a black family in the @entity75 , ending that 233 - year - old color barrier , but there 's a lot more work that needs to be done , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity238 , @entity239 and @entity240 contributed to this report .			0
