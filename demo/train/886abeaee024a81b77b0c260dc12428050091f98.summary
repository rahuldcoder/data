president @entity0 used tuesday night 's @entity3 address to demand action on progressive priorities — but his silence on a number of key issues spoke just as loudly as his words			1
in the 70 - minute - long address , the president gave only lip service to immigration reform			1
he made no remarks on protecting @entity15 and @entity16 — just as @entity17 have hinted at a coming battle over welfare reform — and only passing reference to the crowning achievement of his first term , @entity23 , just as it 's beginning to bear fruit for many @entity25			1
and he did n't mention the controversial @entity27 oil pipeline by name , which @entity17 favor as a job - creation opportunity but the @entity30 has said @entity0 would veto			1
the speech was overall a rallying cry to progressives , a promise that he 'll put up a fight for their priorities now that he 's freed from the bounds of another reelection fight			0
it drew widespread praise from congressional democrats , and near - uniform dismissal from @entity17			0
but the omissions were a reminder that , though the president 's popularity is on an upswing , his legacy remains unclear and his final two years in office will still be full of challenges			0
the immigration reform snub was perhaps his most glaring hole			1
@entity0 only warned against " refighting past battles on immigration when we 've got a system to fix , " and called for empathy towards immigrants			2
" yes , passions still fly on immigration , but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student , and agree that no one benefits when a hardworking mom is taken from her child , and that it 's possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants , " he said during tuesday night 's speech			0
that 's in contrast to his 2013 @entity3 speech , when he called for @entity81 to pass a comprehensive reform bill and declared : " let 's get this done			2
" even last year he demanded , " let 's get immigration reform done this year			1
" on this issue , however , @entity0 may be feeling less urgency because he 's already done some of the work on his own , with his executive action delaying deportations for millions of immigrant families last year			0
but the omission underscores what a prickly subject it remains politically , one that 's already the center of another spending fight on @entity100 that will come to a head next month			0
last year , @entity0 used a sizable chunk of his sotu to highlight the benefits @entity25 would receive from the @entity23 , even as the botched rollout of @entity106 drew months of negative headlines and created headaches for vulnerable @entity109 on the campaign trail			1
this year , @entity0 's only hint at reform was his declaration that , " in the past year alone , about 10 million uninsured @entity25 finally gained the security of health coverage			2
" that silence comes despite the fact at least 6.4 million @entity25 signed up for coverage under the law during this year 's enrollment period , a significant spike from last year			0
but @entity23 still remains unpopular , with the @entity123 average of polls showing a majority of @entity25 still oppose it			0
with @entity17 attention focused elsewhere , the best course for the president on that issue may be to let sleeping dogs lie — especially as many @entity25 may face penalties when they file their taxes this year because of the law			0
@entity0 also left off a pair of progressive pet priorities that have gotten bigger play before — gun control and campaign finance reform			1
with the @entity139 in @entity109 hands last year , @entity0 pledged to " keep trying " to reduce gun violence ; this year , he avoided the topic altogether			1
and though the speech came on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the @entity148 's @entity147 decision , which opened the floodgates for big - money donors to influence elections , @entity0 did n't talk about super pacs or public financing for campaigns			2
still , with historic references to transgender and lesbian individuals , and a call for tax hikes on the wealthy , most progressives had little to complain about on tuesday night .			0

president @entity0 did n't mention or comparatively *downplayed* a number of key issues in his @entity3
he mostly avoided @entity23 and immigration reform , despite acting on those issues during his time in office
he also ignored gun control and campaign finance reform , two of progressives ' pet priorities
