among chief executives , @entity0 was an outlier			2
ceos of public companies are generally hands - on , but @entity0 was involved in practically every detail , from determining which industries @entity8 should invade to the material used for the @entity11 's screen			1
@entity0 even got directly involved in customer service , which was a part of @entity8 's business for which he exercised a great deal of attention and patience			1
he fielded e-mails about broken laptops and intervened on support calls			2
by comparison , a representative for @entity22 , @entity8 's longtime carrier partner for the coveted @entity11 , threatened a customer , who had twice e-mailed company ceo @entity26 complaining about price hikes , with a cease - and - desist notice			1
" i do n't think even @entity0 can spin 2 gb for $ 25/month as a good thing for the consumer , " the customer , @entity30 , wrote in his recap , as reported by @entity32 , which is a @entity34 content partner			2
unlike other leaders , @entity0 was not only handling an unusual number of his company 's own basic customer service inquiries , but he also fielded some of @entity26 's , since @entity22 and @entity8 were conjoined on various business interests relating to the @entity11 and @entity43			1
when a customer asked @entity0 via e-mail in 2008 why @entity47 owners could tether their phones to their computers for wireless internet access but the same could not be done with an @entity11 , @entity0 wrote , " we agree , and are discussing it with @entity22			1
" the feature eventually came			0
asked about tethering an @entity11 to an @entity43 on @entity22 , @entity0 replied only , " no. " @entity0 consoled another @entity22 customer , @entity53 , who expressed his frustration over his cell carrier 's plans to discontinue unlimited data plans			1
" i think its ( sic ) going to work out just fine for almost all customers			0
try it , " @entity0 wrote , but he was less supportive in a message to another customer , @entity63 , about the same matter : " it 's between you and @entity22			1
" @entity0 's proclivity for responding to e-mails , and the reputation that came with that , made his inbox a prominent target for customers looking to overstep rows of supervisors to get broken computers replaced and generous credit for service outages			1
this approach intensified as his legendary reputation and @entity8 's customer base grew			1
@entity8 took notice and repurposed the messages to be used as data points for internal use , evidenced by a graph charting customer complaints about the ill - fated internet service , @entity89			1
long before that , however , @entity0 was extraordinarily embedded in handling customer complaints			1
on october 11 , 1999 , not long after @entity0 returned to a dying company and took on the title of interim ceo ( or @entity94 ) , he fielded an inquiry from a customer named @entity97 about @entity99 laptop shortages			1
" we are doing the best we can with a limited supply ( which is finally now increasing )			0
please remember that some of the first pre-orders came from @entity104 , " @entity0 wrote			2
dozens of stories have floated around the web about the times when an e-mail to @entity0 yielded a phone call from an executive support team and an outcome that far exceeded reasonable expectations			2
in 1999 , a customer got his @entity116 desktop repaired after an e-mail to @entity0 resulted in a phone call from the mysterious executive relations team			2
in 2001 , a student software developer was told by @entity8 support that , despite his sob story about dropping the hard drive connected to his laptop causing damage , they could n't resolve an issue that resulted from physical abuse			2
after writing to the ceo , he got a call from one of @entity0 ' associates who asked him several questions and then tempered his expectations by saying similarly that he did not meet the standards for a comped repair			2
but a month passed after he took his computer in for repairs , and there was still no charge from @entity8			0
the customer recalled on an internet message board : " i contacted the support people , and they said the charges had been waived by ' someone higher up			0
' @entity0 must be smiling on me			0
" @entity0 would not always grant customers ' wishes , and he certainly did not buy into the adage that " the customer is always right			2
" for example , a customer complaining about @entity8 not honoring its warranty for his computer received the following response from @entity0 in 2008 : " this is what happens when your @entity156 sustains water damage			1
they are pro machines and they do n't like water			0
it sounds like you 're just looking for someone to get mad at other than yourself			0
" @entity0 did n't often pick up the phone to go back and forth with customers , but at least one @entity8 customer , @entity168 , recalls a time when an e-mail to @entity0 , explaining how there seemed to be no end in sight to his wait for a computer repair , was met with a phone call			1
" hi @entity168 , this is @entity0 , " @entity168 recalled hearing from the other end of the phone			0
" @entity0 ? " he asked			0
" yeah , " @entity0 said			0
" i just wanted to apologize for your incredibly long wait			1
it 's really nobody 's fault			0
it 's just one of those things			0
" " yeah , i understand			0
" then @entity0 explained that he expedited the repair			0
" i also wanted to thank you for your support of @entity8 , " @entity0 said			1
" i see how much equipment you own			0
it really makes my day to see someone who enjoys our products so much and who supports us in the good times and bad			0

@entity8 's @entity0 sometimes fielded customer service inquiries by e-mail
@entity0 sometimes provided *exceptional* support but could also be cold
" i just wanted to apologize for your incredibly long wait , " @entity0 told one customer
