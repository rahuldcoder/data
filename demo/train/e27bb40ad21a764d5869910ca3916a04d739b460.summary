-- three hundred days : that 's how long a private contractor will have to cover a remote area of the @entity4 a little smaller than the country of @entity6 where officials believe missing @entity8 ended up			1
the time frame for the sea floor search was included in documents released wednesday by @entity13 authorities seeking bids from companies to carry out the next phase of the hunt for the passenger jet			1
nearly three months after flight 370 disappeared over @entity21 , searchers have found no trace of the @entity23 or the 239 people aboard , making it one of the biggest mysteries in aviation history			2
authorities have not been able to explain why the jet veered dramatically off course during a scheduled flight from @entity29 to @entity30 on march 8 or to say where exactly its errant journey ended			2
hopes of closure for the families of those on board were raised in early april , when a search team in the southern @entity4 detected pings that were initially believed to have come from the plane 's flight recorders			1
but last week , @entity13 authorities said that an exhaustive search of the sea floor around the pings had found no wreckage , ruling it out as the aircraft 's final resting place			1
' a very challenging task ' now , officials are preparing for the next stage of the search			2
@entity52 , the closest country to the area where the plane is believed to have entered the ocean , has decided to delegate the management and operation of the new phase to a private company			1
the @entity60 , which is leading the search at the request of the @entity64 government , said wednesday that it is accepting proposals for the task until the end of june			2
the new search is expected to start in august , at the earliest			2
" this is a very challenging task , one that relies on very effectively limited information , " @entity69 , the bureau 's chief commissioner , told @entity0 's " @entity74 " this week			0
" but information , if analyzed and viewed carefully , can give a lot of evidence about the likely location of the aircraft			0
" the exact search area is yet to be defined , as an international team of experts is reviewing the satellite , radar and other data that led to the conclusion that the plane flew into the southern @entity4			1
it will be in the vicinity of an arc hundreds of kilometers long -- the area where investigators believe the aircraft ran out of fuel , about 1,000 miles off the coast of @entity52			1
@entity69 said officials remain " cautiously optimistic " that the plane 's resting place will be found			1
' holes , trenches , ridges ' the @entity60 says the new search area will be around 60,000 square kilometers ( 23,000 square miles )			1
the winning bidder will have to cover 5,000 square kilometers of the area every 25 days or risk payment being withheld			1
the contractor will also have to provide daily progress reports and submit its plans for the following 24 hours , the documents say			0
the chosen company will face a stern challenge , operating in one of the most isolated and hostile environments on the planet			0
the previous phase of the search , both above and below the surface of the water , was repeatedly disrupted by bad weather			1
some of the ocean in the region is so remote , authorities are n't sure exactly how deep it is			2
the tender documents warn that the search operation will be dealing with depths of up to 6,000 meters ( 20,000 feet ) -- and in a variety of sea states and ocean currents			2
the underwater terrain in question could involve " holes , trenches , ridges , steep gradients , isolated features " and a sea floor potentially made of silt , sand , rock and other materials , the tender documents say			0
a specialized @entity143 ship has begun mapping the ocean floor in some areas already picked out by the @entity60			0
a contracted commercial survey vessel will join those efforts this month			0
unclear who pays what the bureau does n't provide any specific numbers about how much the contractor will be paid			0
@entity52 had estimated that the next phase of the search would cost $ 60 million , with the breakdown of who 's going to pay for what still to be announced			1
while 26 countries have participated in the hunt for the missing plane , @entity64 , @entity143 and @entity52 have held high - level talks about the future of the search			1
@entity64 is where the plane is from , but most of the people on the flight were @entity143			0
as the official search transitions into its next phase , @entity64 's acting transportation minister released a statement wednesday outlining the " way forward			1
" " we have entered a new difficult phase which brings with it new challenges which we will overcome together , " @entity173 said			0
" as we enter the new phase of this search , we are grateful for the continuous support that we have received from the international community			2
" that continued support from the international community will include " specialized assets and services " from the @entity185 and others , according to @entity173			0
he said he 's asked defense secretary @entity187 to continue using the @entity189 - owned @entity188 - 21 , an autonomous underwater vehicle , as well as the remotely operated @entity191 - 21			0
@entity173 also announced wednesday that @entity195 - based engineering and technology company @entity193 is " finalizing terms " for an oceanographic survey vessel , @entity197 and deep sea sonar			0
@entity64 's state - owned oil company @entity199 will also be funding a deep towed side - scan sonar and crew , according to @entity173			0
as the disappearance of @entity8 approaches the 90 - day mark , theories about the plane 's fate continue to circulate			0
an @entity13 university on wednesday released an audio recording and other information about an underwater sound that they say could be related to the final moments of the plane			1
and independent experts are studying the satellite data that have played a key role in guiding the search to see whether they agree with the official analysis that the plane ended up in the southern @entity4			1
is mystery underwater sound the crash of @entity8 what happens next in the search for @entity8 ? @entity8 : is @entity225 right ? @entity0 's @entity226 contributed to this report .			0

@entity52 seeks bids from private companies for next phase of search
the chosen contractor will have *300* days to cover a vast *swath* of ocean
authorities are still determining the exact search area in the @entity4
an @entity13 official says he remains " cautiously optimistic " the plane will be found
