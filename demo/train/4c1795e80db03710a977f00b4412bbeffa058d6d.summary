-- @entity1 believes he is " close " to the form that took him to the top of the world rankings and two major titles and after carding a flawless nine - under 63 to lead the @entity7 thursday few could disagree			1
certainly not playing partner and defending champion @entity9 , who said @entity1 had played " sublime golf " to take a two - shot lead after the first round on the @entity12 course			1
@entity9 also compiled a fine round of 66 and was not overawed by playing with both @entity1 and current world number one @entity16 , who is handily placed after a 68			1
@entity1 , whose travails in 2013 are well documented , was certainly not getting carried away with his efforts in perfect morning conditions , describing them as " good " and my best round " in a while			1
" the 24 - year - old from @entity26 has a two - shot lead over later starter @entity28 of @entity29 and knows he will have to maintain his form through the weekend			1
" i took advantage of how i am driving the ball and just need to do more of the same the next three days , " he told the official @entity32 website			0
@entity1 finished 2013 with a victory in the @entity36 and has started the new calendar year by claiming second in @entity38 , where his victory hopes were dashed by a two - shot penalty in the opening round			1
asked how close he was to peak form , @entity1 added : " it 's close , obviously			2
this year i 've shot a couple of good rounds			0
this is a little lower than i went in @entity38 and i feel very comfortable with my game			0
" last year both he and then new @entity49 stablemate @entity16 missed the cut in @entity38 and while the @entity51 improved rapidly to claim five @entity53 titles , @entity1 continued to struggle until the back end of the season , slipping to sixth in the rankings			1
but with a new management team in place and marriage to tennis star @entity60 in the offing , @entity1 has buckled down to a strict practice regime			2
" i realize that i 've worked really hard in the last couple of months to get to this point and i 've realized what i needed to work on , what i need to base my game on and around , " he said			0
" okay it may feel easy and these scores may look somewhat routine out there , but there 's a lot of hard work that goes on behind the scenes to actually be able to go out and shoot scores like this			0
" @entity16 missed the cut for the final round at @entity78 in his opening tournament of the @entity53 season last week , but was more satisfied with his efforts in the @entity32 event			2
" i played all right today			0
i probably could have got a couple more out of it			0
i did n't hit a bad putt today which was nice , it was just that sometimes the grain grabbed it pretty hard at the end , " he said			0
@entity9 was left in a five - strong chasing group on 66 as the trio were cumulatively 19 - under - par. " me and @entity16 had a couple of holes where we had great saves of par but it was one of those days where we took advantage of the conditions , it was quite benign , " he said			1
sixty eight players from the 132 - strong field broke the par of 72 , with former major champions @entity104 and @entity106 on two - under 70			2
@entity38 winner @entity107 struggled to a two - over 74 , the same mark as 2012 @entity110 champion @entity109 and with work to do to make the cut .			0
