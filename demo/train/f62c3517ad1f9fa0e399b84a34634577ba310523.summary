-- four years ago , if someone said " @entity2 " or " @entity3 " to you , nine out of 10 people would have shrugged their shoulders and said " who ? " now , they 're pretty much among the most wanted and talked - about actors in @entity12 -- and it 's all thanks to the whopping success of the " @entity16 " franchise			1
and while the " @entity20 " films will mark the end of that series , nearly everyone in the know has pegged " @entity23 " as the next " @entity16			1
" so , take note of these names : @entity26 and @entity27 -- the next young megastars who will face the gift and curse of instant @entity12 fame			1
as the two male leads in " hunger , " their careers will receive an instant injection of megawatt star power and credibility , they 'll be remarkably wealthy and among the a-list ... but they 'll also be scrutinized and trailed by the paparazzi and media everywhere they go			1
that 's the trade - off these days , where any form of success or notoriety means everything in your life is now fair game -- chum in the water for the media sharks			1
most actors and @entity12 stars gradually work their way up the ladder , but with the cult teen followings of " @entity16 " and " hunger " -- and both series ' decisions to go with less - than - well - known names as the leads ( save for @entity63 in " games " ) -- the transition from working actor to on - the - cover - of - everything can be a tough one to swallow			1
thankfully for @entity26 and @entity27 , they have co-stars , girlfriends ( @entity27 has been dating @entity70 on and off , and @entity26 was linked to @entity71 ) friends and past co-workers who can help steer them through the blinding headlights of fame that are bearing down on them			1
their " hunger " co-star @entity76 experienced the same instant rise last year when she was nominated for an @entity79 for her turn in " @entity81			1
" she went from relatively unknown actress to hot - new during awards season and will surely serve as a fame coach for her male counterparts			1
she recently opined on her methodology for avoiding the pitfalls of fame in a @entity90 interview , saying : " as long as you remember what you 're here for -- you 're here for the work , you 're here to make a film			1
... there seems to be some very bizarre habit where as soon as you become big and famous , you think that you do n't have to work anymore			2
and it 's just such a weird trend that i 'm starting to see			2
but i run into grounded people all the time			2
given , most of them are behind the camera			2
but i definitely by no means think i 'm the only one			2
" so with that mindset , what can @entity26 and @entity27 do to stay ( relatively ) grounded once they become the next big things ? here 's a good checklist			1
choose wisely : this should apply to every aspect of your life , from who you surround yourself with and who you date , to what movies you are thinking of tackling			2
all of the minutiae of your life is now in full view , and a certain portion of the media loves nothing more than to exploit every misstep			2
take a look to your left or right the next time you 're in a business meeting or out with friends and ask yourself : " is this person here for me , or for their own benefit ? " 2			0
stay ( somewhat ) private : we 've already discussed the nosy media , but now with @entity138 and other social media , celebrities can live out every action , thought and event in real time for all of the world to see			0
sure , it 's a great promotional vehicle , but it 's one more trap that is 100 % avoidable			0
do n't want your @entity138 account hacked where someone posts nasty things in your name ? well , do n't have a @entity138 account			0
if you keep access to yourself somewhat limited , when you do actually have something to say , it makes it that much more powerful			0
otherwise , people will get bored with hearing you tell them what you ate for lunch that day and miss the good stuff when you 've got it			0
plus , it adds a bit of mystery and allure to you			0
do n't live in @entity167 : yes , it 's where most movies are made and where all of your agents and associates are			0
yes , it 's got great weather , killer clubs / restaurants and all that			0
it also has a cannibalistic , frenzied media who pay their rent by looking to capture your lowest moments			0
naturally , not having " low moments " is the more prudent option here , but keeping an apartment in @entity167 for work trips and residing elsewhere ( ' @entity189 ' himself @entity190 recently told us he could n't take @entity167 and moved back to his hometown of @entity193 ) will surely minimize the paparazzi hassle			0
charity , charity , charity : you 've struck it big -- now give back			0
not only will it make you feel fulfilled ( @entity26 has already been working with straight but not narrow , a clever gay rights @entity202 ) , but it 'll expose you to new audiences and groups who may not be drooling over " @entity206			1
do n't be a jerk : if being well - adjusted and great acting travel at the speed of sound , news of being a difficult you - know - what whips through @entity12 at light speed			1
agents , publicists , writers -- we all know each other , and we all talk about who 's nice and who 's a nightmare			0
simply put : just be nice .			0

@entity26 and @entity27 will see instant @entity12 fame after " @entity23 "
@entity76 experienced an instant rise to fame when she was nominated for an @entity79
any form of success or notoriety means everything in your life is fair game
