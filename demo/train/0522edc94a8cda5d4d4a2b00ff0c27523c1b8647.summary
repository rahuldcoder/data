@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 climber @entity3 has been at @entity6 base camp for the last 10 days , waiting to find out if his attempt to summit the world 's highest peak can go ahead			1
he says it 's been 10 days of rumors -- 10 days of watching other expedition teams make the difficult decision to leave , one by one			2
this morning , he and his team finally decided to pack up and follow them			0
" for once , the local people decided about @entity6 , " he says			2
i 've been climbing towards base camp through the @entity0 for the last five days			1
helicopters have been a constant presence , breaking the beautiful silence that lovers of the mountains treasure			0
they carry negotiators to @entity28 , officials to base camp and climbers back home			1
on the ground , i cross paths with yak caravans , ascending empty and descending with full loads			0
" why is everyone leaving ? " a @entity38 climber asks me			2
" there is still one month of opportunity before the monsoon arrives			0
" despite conflicting reports to the contrary , the mountain is still open			2
the government has not issued any prohibition against climbing , releasing a statement on april 24 encouraging expedition teams to go ahead with the season			1
but support for this season 's climb has trickled away , day after day , since the april 18 avalanche that left 13 guides dead and three missing -- the deadliest accident in the history of the world 's highest peak			1
a group of about 50 people , mostly @entity64 , were hit by the avalanche at more than 20,000 feet just above base camp in the @entity67			1
@entity68 , an ethnic group from @entity1 's @entity70 famed for their climbing prowess , are n't officially stopping anyone from attempting the risky journey , though hundreds involved in the lucrative @entity6 trekking industry have refused to climb			1
" without the @entity68 we can not climb and there is nothing we can do about it , " says @entity3			1
" we made @entity6 a circus			2
this year the @entity68 decided that the show will not go on			2
" sherpas open the route on the @entity64 side of @entity6 , through the treacherous @entity67			1
they fix the climbing lines all the way to the summit of @entity6 , transport the equipment to make camp , climb next to their clients while carrying their oxygen and food , and rescue those in danger			1
without their assistance , making the long , dangerous journey is nearly impossible for all but the most experienced of climbers			2
@entity6 avalanche : @entity101 climber recounts how @entity102 saved his life mixed feelings on canceled season it was n't a unanimous decision by @entity1 's @entity102 to abandon the season -- there 's no unanimous motive			1
some do n't want to climb because they 're in mourning -- a sign of respect for their friends who died in the avalanche and their families			1
others do n't want to climb for religious reasons			1
the sherpa spiritual code of conduct , which interconnects humans and nature , has been violated , they say			0
to put it simply , the gods are angry			0
some refuse to climb for political reasons : they want better insurance from the @entity1 government and scholarships for their children			1
some do n't want to climb because of safety : there have been several avalanches reported since the tragedy			2
there have even been reports of threats of violence to climbers who try to continue			0
it 's still possible , according to some reports , to find guides willing to take you to the summit on the northern , @entity146 side of the mountain			0
but in @entity1 the season is looking bleak			1
@entity149 calls off coverage of @entity6 wingsuit jump ' how will i convince my wife to let me go away again ? ' the @entity1 government makes about $ 3 million from royalties on @entity6 each spring season			1
more than 330 foreign climbers had been given permission to climb @entity6 over the next couple of months , with an estimated 400 guides helping them , spending between $ 40,000 and $ 90,000 each in their attempt to scale the mountain			1
the short window , may 15 - 30 , is usually the best time to make an attempt to reach @entity6 's peak			2
as discussions took place on the fate of the @entity6 season last week , many climbers left base camp to continue their acclimatization process on other mountains in the region			1
" when we went back , we found base camp empty , " says @entity173 , a @entity174 member of the @entity175			1
" there is nothing we can do but leave as well			0
" he says the @entity1 government told him his @entity6 climbing permit will remain valid for the next five years			1
" that 's fine , but how will i convince my wife to let me go away again for two months ? " one of the reasons an @entity6 expedition takes so long is the time required for multiple rotations up and down the mountain to help the body adjust to the thin air , says professional climber @entity190 ( who summited @entity6 in 2011 ) on his blog			1
" a typical @entity6 climber will spend 10 - 15 days sleeping high on the mountain above @entity194 before going on their summit attempt , " he says			1
" they sleep at ever - increasing altitudes to trick the body into making the necessary physiological changes , especially with respect to respiration , the key to survival at extreme altitudes			0
" sherpas seek better employment opportunities on the route to base camp i meet @entity102 , who is making his way down from base camp			1
" i am ready to climb , " he says			0
" i want to stand by my clients ; it is their decision whether to climb or not			2
" he says the leader of his team called the expedition off on monday			0
" he told us that the icefall is too risky			0
" some teams left earlier out of respect for their sherpa , many of whom work on climbing expeditions only because they do n't have access to better economic opportunities			0
they make up to $ 6,000 per season and usually get a summit bonus if their clients reach the top of the 8,848 - meter ( 29,020 - feet ) mountain			0
it 's a stark contrast to what drives the foreign visitors to climb			0
" in our time the best job available was climbing ; it 's not anymore , " says @entity236 , who owns the @entity237 in @entity238 , a popular acclimatization village among tourists			0
her daughter is now a medical doctor living in the @entity101			0
" tourists asked me how long have i been a sherpa			0
i am a sherpa since i was born ! some of us become porters and climbers , most of us , luckily , can avoid it [ nowadays ]			0
" other @entity1 ethnic groups are starting to replace the sherpa , as they manage to secure better jobs			2
among the 16 people dead or missing in the april 18 tragedy , three are from other ethnic groups			1
@entity6 climbing season up in air after avalanche deaths only a handful remain for the few still hanging on in base camp in the hope of making the summit , their chances get slimmer with each day that passes			1
the @entity67 moves one meter per day : the ladders are lost , the lines broken			0
none of the camps on the mountain itself are operative , i 'm told , and nobody has reached @entity276 3 yet -- one of four camps set up on @entity6 en route to the summit			2
nobody is left to do the heavy work for the foreign climbers , and most have come to the realization over the last few days that climbing is not a possibility for them			0
until the late 1970s , only a handful of climbers reached the top each year			0
the number topped 100 for the first time in 1993			0
by 2004 , it was more than 300			0
in 2012 , the number was more than 500			0
the deadliest year on @entity6 was 1996 , when 15 people died			2
another 12 climbers were killed in 2006			0
