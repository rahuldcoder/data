@entity0 , @entity1 -- the most important @entity4 summit in its 61 - year history -- according to @entity4 secretary general @entity6 -- began friday in @entity0 , @entity1			1
@entity4 was founded by the @entity7 and 14 other nations after @entity9 but it has grown to 28 members , and is now seeking to shed its @entity12 identity by adopting a new " strategic concept , " framing new threats the alliance faces and the means to combat them			2
but getting 28 nations on the same page about how to address a range of new evolving threats will not be easy			2
the document to be considered this weekend is the product of a set of recommendations from a group of experts led by former @entity7 secretary of state @entity27			2
the last strategic concept was drafted in 1999			0
the new document reflects new realities for @entity4 and the world			0
the original @entity4 existed during the @entity12 for the collective defense of 15 nations against @entity35 aggression			0
@entity7 ambassador to @entity4 @entity37 likes to call that @entity4 1.0			0
@entity4 2.0 marked the period between the end of the @entity12 and the present			0
this stretch saw @entity4 enter wars in @entity43 and @entity44 and embrace former @entity35 republics in @entity46 that were looking @entity47			1
at @entity0 , @entity4 hopes to move into what @entity37 calls 3.0 status , meant for operating in a globalized world			0
@entity4 still has the core mandate to provide collective security for all its members , said @entity37 , but now must address new threats to @entity46 's security -- threats not as much from @entity56 , but from possible terrorist attacks , cyber attacks , attacks on energy infrastructure and piracy on the high seas			1
this new definition of what constitutes a threat calls into question the future of @entity68 of the @entity4 charter , which considers an attack on one member an attack on all			1
for an alliance whose mantra is " collective security , " the provision is the critical binding agent			0
@entity68 was invoked for the first time after september 11 , 2001 , when all @entity4 members agreed the attack was a visible threat to the security of the entire alliance			1
but the definition of what constitutes a threat to all @entity4 allies is becoming less recognizable , say some experts			2
@entity4 's makeover also expands its battlefield well beyond @entity46			1
the mission in @entity94 is the largest and most recent example			2
but @entity4 is also providing support to efforts to combat piracy in the @entity99 and there is serious talk that the alliance could send forces to the @entity104 if the @entity105 and @entity106 ever reach a peace deal			2
the expansion of @entity4 's role into a global force , however , is somewhat at odds with the economic realities facing its members , more than half of which are cutting defense spending			1
@entity4 officials worry such a reluctance to invest in the alliance not only diminishes @entity46 's ability to contribute , it also increases the likelihood of the @entity7 going it alone			1
@entity120 , who served as @entity4 ambassador from 2008 - 2009 , said not all @entity4 members want to be the world 's policemen			1
" in some ways , the @entity7 and @entity46 are pulling in opposite directions , " @entity120 said			0
" the @entity7 sees problems and strategic issues outside the @entity4 area they want @entity4 to address and wants a more global @entity4			2
but a lot of @entity46 countries still view @entity4 as about @entity46 and the @entity46 space			1
" at @entity0 , the @entity7 wants @entity4 leaders to agree to plans for a missile defense shield to defend against ballistic missiles			0
the @entity138 administration plan to deploy a long - range anti-missile defense system in @entity140 and the @entity141 angered @entity56 , which feared the goal was to undermine its nuclear deterrent			0
the @entity144 proposed by the @entity146 administration would deploy a continent - wide interceptor - missile system clearly aimed at defending against any missile threat posed by @entity150			0
that 's more palatable to @entity56 , but @entity4 - member @entity152 , which could be one of the sites for the radar systems , does n't want to upset its growing ties with @entity150			1
cooperation on missile defense is just one way @entity4 will seek to close the @entity161 chapter of its history			2
when @entity4 leaders meet this weekend with @entity56 president @entity164 , they plan to endorse a new @entity56 / @entity4 partnership to work on issues such as terrorism , @entity94 and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction			1
since the late ' 80s @entity4 has struggled with how to transform its sometimes schizophrenic relationship with @entity56 , its former enemy			0
at times , @entity56 has played nice			0
it was instrumental in helping end the @entity43 war and even sent forces under @entity7 command			0
when the dust settled in @entity44 , @entity178 sent troops as part of @entity4 's @entity183 mission			1
but @entity56 troops still occupy @entity186 territory after clashes there in 2008 and @entity178 still maintains a sphere of influence over other countries in its neighborhood			0
the @entity35 may be no longer , but fear of the @entity56 bear still looms large in @entity46 members of @entity4 who want protection from a resurgent @entity56			1
@entity4 officials acknowledge there are trust issues to overcome with @entity56			0
still , they hope the substantial common interests @entity4 shares with @entity56 make cooperation possible			0
in @entity0 , @entity4 and @entity56 officials hope to release a joint assessment of threats and lay out their priorities for cooperation			2
still , @entity120 said , ambiguity in the relationship between @entity56 and @entity4 remains			0
" we never did a good job in making clear there is no reason why @entity56 could n't be a member of @entity4 , " said @entity120			0
" if they really became a democracy and market economy , if they believe in freedom , rule of law and human rights , why the heck not ? " @entity4 's mission in @entity94 is a litmus test for the future of @entity4 , say some experts			1
the military campaign against the @entity225 has regained momentum and the summit is expected to announce plans for a transfer of control to @entity94 forces by the end of 2014			2
but the ability of @entity4 to build the @entity94 government has proven less successful			1
while @entity4 forces are increasingly successful against the @entity225 , it remains very unclear whether @entity94 president @entity237 's government will be able to sustain the " holding and building " of the provinces once they are transferred			1
@entity4 's presence in @entity94 has lasted nine years			1
but while all @entity4 allies have contributed in @entity94 , their commitments are sometimes limited or inconsistent			1
even larger countries like @entity246 , @entity247 and @entity248 have caveats that their troops only serve in areas of limited combat			0
many others have withdrawn entirely in the face of public opposition			0
if @entity94 ends well , @entity4 allies in @entity46 may well consider future missions beyond its borders			1
if the mission fails , @entity46 could conclude the experiment was a mistake and stick closer to home and the @entity7 could conclude that @entity4 is not a reliable partner			1
the @entity265 panel warned early in its recommendations that " threats to the alliance come from the outside , but the organization 's vigor could be as easily sapped from within			0

most important @entity4 summit in its 61 - year history , says secretary general
@entity4 to address new threats to @entity46 's security : terrorists , cyber attack , piracy
@entity4 's mission in @entity94 is a litmus test for the future of @entity4 , say some experts
