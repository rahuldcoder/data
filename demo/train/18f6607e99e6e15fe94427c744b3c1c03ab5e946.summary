@entity2 @entity1 sen. @entity0 will lose his slot as majority leader once the @entity5 takes control of the @entity7 next year			1
but his @entity2 counterpart in the @entity7 , @entity9 @entity8 , is reportedly working to unseat @entity0 altogether in 2016			1
@entity8 said he " of course " reached out to @entity5 gov. @entity10 to run to unseat @entity0 in 2016 , according to a report out wednesday from the @entity12			1
@entity10 , the first @entity14 man elected to statewide office in his state , handily won his gubernatorial bid with more than 70 percent of the vote earlier this month			2
@entity10 told the @entity19 this week that he is committed to serving out his term as governor , counting himself out for a move to @entity23 in two years if he sticks to his word			0
" i think he 'll want to assess , and we 'll give him a little time to do that , " @entity8 said			0
" there are plenty of people i 'm sure could play in that race			0
" @entity0 , a senator since 1987 , has already signaled his intentions to run for reelection in 2016			2
but he faces an uphill battle similar to the competitive race for his last re-election in 2010			0
unseating him -- a long - time @entity1 fixture in @entity38 considered a lightning rod figure by some on the right -- could be a symbolic victory for conservatives looking to maintain their new @entity7 majority beyond 2016			1
" senator @entity0 and senator @entity8 have known each other for a long time , " @entity0 's spokeswoman @entity45 said in a statement to the @entity12			2
" working together , they are able to do good things for @entity2 and that is our top priority			0
" @entity0 's office did not immediately return @entity55 's request for comment			0
@entity8 lost his bid thursday to become chair of the @entity59 , a group which works to promote and elect @entity5 senators			1
sen. @entity61 of @entity62 will replace outgoing @entity59 chairman @entity63 of @entity64			0
the position was viewed as a critical one for @entity8 : it would have increased his authority in the @entity7 leading into the 2016 elections , giving him authority to recruit candidates like @entity10 and actively fundraise for them .			1
