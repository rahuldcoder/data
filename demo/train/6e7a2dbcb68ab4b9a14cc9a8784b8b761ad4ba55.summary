-- a student - led group that has been occupying the @entity5 governor 's office to protest the state 's stand your ground law and the @entity11 verdict decided to give up the fight thursday and is leaving the state @entity13			1
the @entity15 began their occupation of the office of @entity5 gov. @entity18 in @entity19 , just days after @entity11 was acquitted of second - degree murder in the death of @entity22			1
they demanded that @entity18 call a special legislative session to overturn the state 's stand your ground law			1
@entity18 met with them a few days later to hear their demands but told them he would not call the special session			1
" we feel we 've done all we could , said @entity33 , a spokeswoman for the group			2
" we asked for the special session			1
we 're not getting it and now we 're going to the individual districts to lobby lawmakers and to register voters			1
we 're going to take it to the streets , " she said			0
the deadly encounter between @entity11 , 29 , and @entity22 took place on february 26 , 2012 , as @entity22 , 17 , walked back to his father 's fiancee 's house through the rain from a @entity50 convenience store			2
@entity22 was carrying skittles and a drink			0
@entity11 , a neighborhood watch volunteer , spotted him and called police			0
a 911 dispatcher told @entity11 that officers were on the way and not to follow the allegedly suspicious person			0
nonetheless , @entity11 got out of his car , later telling police he just wanted to get a definitive address to relay to authorities			0
sometime after that , @entity11 and @entity22 got into a physical altercation			0
@entity11 claimed at his trial that he shot @entity22 in self - defense			0
some accused @entity11 -- who identifies himself as @entity67 -- of racially profiling the @entity70 - @entity69 teenager , a claim @entity11 's defense flatly denied			1
the case brought issues of race and the use of stand your ground laws to the forefront			2
on thursday night , the group planned to march the governor 's mansion to deliver what it is calling an eviction notice to @entity18			1
" we 're coming for his job ... the young people of @entity5 are coming for his job , " @entity33 said			2
@entity91 's @entity90 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 and @entity0 's @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 contributed to this report .			0
