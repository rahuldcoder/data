-- for sale : one football club , formerly the best in @entity4 , now fallen on hard times			1
buyer : @entity8 family , determined to restore club 's " glory days			1
" when it was announced this week that a @entity14 family had agreed to take over @entity15 , two - time winner of the @entity17 , the big question became : is this another @entity18 or @entity19 -- or more evidence of football 's " prune juice " theory ? for every @entity25 and @entity26 , there is a @entity30 or @entity31 's to prove that money pumped into one end of a club generally comes straight out the other			1
indeed , @entity15 -- last a member of @entity35 's top division as long ago as 1999 -- reportedly required more than $ 100 million of investment from @entity37 during his 13 - year spell as owner			1
how much is @entity18 's victory worth for @entity41 ? that might not seem like a lot for a @entity45 team , but for one that last season only narrowly avoided a return to the third tier , it 's a significant amount			2
however , the @entity51 family could potentially achieve a much greater return on their investment at @entity15 than , say , the series of money men who have followed in @entity58 's unsuccessful attempt to make capital out of former @entity45 side @entity60			1
" financial interest from the @entity63 has fallen into two camps : the genuine and the fantasists , " @entity8 football expert @entity61 told @entity0			0
" you have on one hand the likes of @entity25 who bought @entity18 , put his money where his mouth is and within four years has transformed the club from also - rans into title winners			2
they are now feared across @entity4			0
@entity75 dreams : @entity41 celebrates @entity18 's title triumph " on the other you have a string of failed takeovers from those hoping @entity8 money could be some kind of panacea			2
or in the case of @entity60 were taken over by the @entity85 's @entity30 and eventually became the first @entity45 club to go into administration			2
" this takeover appears to fall in to the former category , largely because they have a successful track record in domestic football			0
remember , @entity18 was n't the first club @entity25 bankrolled			2
his first love is the @entity41 - based club @entity95			2
likewise the @entity51 family have turned @entity14 club @entity97 into a local regional powerhouse			1
" while @entity60 's only @entity101 titles date back to 1949 - 50 , @entity15 won the old first division championship relatively recently in 1978 and then shocked the football world by lifting @entity4 's top club trophy in the following two seasons			1
will football clubs play fair financially ? " it makes a great deal of sense for an investor to buy into a club of @entity15 's stature , " says @entity107 , professor of sport business strategy and marketing at @entity35 's @entity109			1
" there is some equity in the brand amongst fans and potential fans that dates back to their successes in the late ' 70s and early ' 80s			0
this brand equity can offer things to customers and investors that other organizations ca n't			2
" @entity15 's near neighbor @entity130 , another club to have lost top - flight status in recent years , is now owned by a @entity134 group -- but @entity107 says there is a big difference in their earning potential			1
" @entity15 's financial position , while not being especially strong , is more stable than it has been over the past five years or so , " he said			1
" for people like the @entity51 family , it depends on what their view of the club is			1
if they see it as a revenue - generating asset , clearly it 's going to take a great deal of hard work to build those revenue streams			2
" it 's there where @entity15 's history and equity of the brand can have an impact			1
@entity15 can deliver a level of revenue that their closest geographic rivals @entity130 ca n't			1
@entity163 has a significant population so in terms of being able to fill a stadium , in terms of latent fan base , it 's very significant			0
" @entity170 revolution : can @entity172 cash make @entity173 a football force ? foreign investors once flocked to the lucrative but highly expensive @entity45 -- @entity176 was reportedly valued at £ 1 billion when the @entity172 royal family was linked with the club -- but the second - tier @entity179 is now proving to be more value for money			1
" @entity25 saw that you needed to find undervalued clubs with history and prestige , " said @entity61 , author of " when @entity182 : football in the @entity188			2
" " @entity18 fit the bill , and in a way @entity15 has even more potential			1
we drool at clubs like @entity193 , @entity176 and @entity194 winning the @entity17 , but @entity15 won back - to - back @entity196 just over 30 years ago and had one of the most iconic managers -- @entity199 -- in charge			1
" a whole industry has boomed over @entity199 -- biographies , novels , films			0
for the reported £ 20 million ( $ 31 million ) , the @entity51 family are getting former @entity207 champions with @entity209 - level exposure for a snip			1
" earlier this year , a @entity213 group agreed to buy @entity214 months before the club 's promotion to the top flight , while @entity218 have bought @entity219 , @entity211 control @entity220 , @entity222 's @entity221 owns @entity223 , a @entity229 group has @entity224 and an @entity227 - born @entity226 businessman has taken over @entity230			2
@entity173 's @entity172 owners aim to be world 's best " it makes the competition for players more intense , the competition for spectators more intense , " @entity107 told @entity0			0
" whereas maybe five or 10 years ago the involvement of a rich investor might have been seen as the right ingredient for success , i think now such is the level of interest in @entity101 football and such is the level of investment , it 's now much more about managerial competence and skill and knowledge of the industry and networking			1
" @entity37 brought in former @entity35 manager @entity252 at the start of last season with disastrous results , and the current @entity258 coach 's short reign resulted in the @entity15 benefactor -- considered one of the most powerful men in @entity226 business -- standing down as chairman			1
@entity37 put the club up for sale , but the @entity266 dealt with the executors of his estate following the investment banker 's death at the age of 54 in february			2
they issued a statement stating their goal to " bring the @entity276 back to the top of the table " but acknowledged " challenging times ahead " -- and have already sacked manager @entity280 just nine months into his three - and - a - half - year contract			0
" if the family is looking at this on a medium to longer term basis , they 'll look to develop a scouting network and sign players for relatively small amounts of money , " @entity107 said			0
" they will have to manage the club in a very shrewd way to make sure they do n't get back into debt in the same way			0
one would hope that @entity15 as a club have learned their lessons			1
" when they were relegated they tried to spend their way out of trouble			0
they dropped further and further down the league structure , while at the same time building up their debts			0
" cash for cups ? @entity172 's sporting influence spreads across the globe if @entity15 fans are getting overexcited about their future , they do n't have to look very far for proof that such a takeover can go horribly wrong			1
in 2009 , city rivals @entity312 announced that football 's oldest professional club -- languishing in the bottom division and in danger of collapsing -- had been bought by a group called @entity319 , purportedly financed by @entity63 money			1
in came former @entity35 manager @entity321 and international star @entity322 on lucrative long - term deals , but they had both gone before the end of that season as @entity328 's promises to wipe out crippling debts proved empty			0
still struggling to survive , the club was sold for a nominal fee of £ 1 just months after the takeover			0
" there will always be this fear			0
the ' fit and proper person test ' applied to new owners is not especially robust or rigorous , so we can never be completely sure about what new owners ' intentions or resources are , " @entity107 said			0
" until we get into this period of ownership , it wo n't be entirely clear what they are able to do			0
" from riches to rags : why @entity350 ' financial meltdown should worry @entity4 he cited the example of @entity353 , who suffered relegation from the @entity45 after only one season under the ownership of @entity359 chicken magnates @entity31 's			0
" the experience since they took over is a stark illustration of how inexperience can cause problems			0
no matter your intentions or how much money you 've got , experience of the industry is very important , " @entity107 said			0
" do they know what they 're letting themselves in for ? running a football club is very different from running other forms of business			0
" what do they see as being the strategic position at @entity15 ? if they are looking to win the @entity45 and get in the @entity17 , they are going to have to invest a significant amount of money			1
" but if their definition of glory days is to get back into the @entity45 then it will require a more modest sum			0
have proved you can establish yourself as a midtable team			0
it 's still very expensive , but not as expensive as what @entity18 have spent to win the title			0

@entity14 family buys former @entity17 winner @entity15
@entity101 club has been out of the elite division for more than a decade
experts say there is great value in buying a team with such a rich history
@entity51 family said to have more *soccer* knowledge than some failed investors
