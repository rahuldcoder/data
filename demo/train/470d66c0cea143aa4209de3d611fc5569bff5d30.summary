-- more than half a century of hostility between the @entity2 and @entity3 has done nothing to diminish the island 's love of @entity2 's national pastime			1
so it came as no surprise wednesday when @entity10 tweeted that it was " closely monitoring " president @entity12 's historic plans to normalize diplomatic relations with @entity3 and ease economic restrictions on the nation			1
" while there are not sufficient details to make a realistic evaluation , we will continue to track this significant issue , and we will keep our clubs informed if this different direction may impact the manner in which they conduct business on issues related to @entity3 , " @entity10 said in the statement			1
but observers say do n't expect an immediate influx of @entity3 talent in the big leagues			1
not yet , at least			0
when the 2014 season opened , 19 players born in @entity3 were listed on @entity10 rosters			1
the island nation was third after the @entity36 with 83 players born there and @entity39 with 59			1
for @entity3 , the 19 players was a record high and surpassed the record set in 2013 with 15 players			1
" year after year , an ideological and economic barrier hardened between our two countries , " @entity12 told the nation			0
" meanwhile , the @entity3 exile community in the @entity2 made enormous contributions to our country , in politics , in business , culture and sports			2
" take recent arrival @entity53 , the 27 - year - old @entity55 - born first baseman for the @entity56			0
@entity53 was voted the @entity57 this season , batting .317 with 36 home runs , 107 rbi and .581 slugging percentage			0
and there 's @entity63 , 29 , the shotgun - armed leftfielder with the @entity65 , who batted .260 with 22 homers and 100 rbi ; @entity70 rightfielder @entity69 , 24 , who hit .296 with 16 home runs and 69 rbi ; and @entity73 closer @entity74 , 26 , who posted 36 saves with 106 strikeouts , a 2.00 @entity77 and brushed back batters with 100 - mph fastballs			0
" this could absolutely have an impact on the game , " @entity80 , managing partner and sports agent at the @entity82 , said of the change in @entity3 policy			2
" there is such a strong @entity90 presence in the @entity10 and some of the biggest stars in today 's game are @entity3			1
" bells ring in @entity95 , anger erupts in @entity96 for decades , @entity3 players who dreamed of playing in @entity10 had to defect from the island			1
some left their squads while traveling abroad with a national team , but others risked their lives by depending on smugglers to get them out			0
many settled in third countries to avoid the @entity10 amateur draft and make the most money as free agents			2
@entity69 's harrowing escape -- which included hiking through crocodile - infested waters and being held captive by a @entity113 trafficking ring that threatened to cut off his arm -- was chronicled by @entity117 and @entity118 magazine			0
a significant shift in @entity2 policy could eliminate such perils			0
" to say it 's a dangerous and shady process is probably an understatement , " @entity122 said			0
" this could be a more diplomatic approach to becoming a free agent in @entity10			1
" but it 's unlikely that @entity3 will allow @entity10 teams to do what the league has long done in the @entity36 , where team - sponsored baseball academies recruit and groom prospects from an early age			1
for a long time , @entity3 has considered players who defected traitors			2
the government is very proud and protective of the homegrown talent it identifies at an early age in state - run baseball academies			0
some observers believe @entity3 is more likely to adopt a system similar to @entity143 , where @entity10 teams pay the player 's team for the right to negotiate and sign him			1
in this case , the player 's team would be the @entity3 government			2
that way , the island keeps control of players and pumps a portion of their contracts into @entity3 's faltering economy			1
9 questions you were embarrassed to ask about the @entity3 embargo @entity3 recently started to allow baseball stars to sign with @entity143 baseball teams			2
the government has been in talks with @entity113 teams about similar arrangements			0
the players ' contracts and salaries are tightly controlled by the @entity3 state			2
" the athletes that are able to leave the country now are finished products , " said @entity170 , a professor of sports management at @entity172			0
" they create bidding wars among the teams			0
if players were free to move and play , we will probably see more ... coming into the market			0
" @entity182 , a writer for @entity183 , tweeted : " @entity3 's already leasing players to @entity143 , tried with @entity113			1
small change compared to what they would making selling stars to @entity10 teams			2
" but arrangements such as those with @entity143 are unlikely as long as the decades - old @entity2 economic embargo against @entity3 remains in place			0
@entity194 , a @entity3 expert at @entity196 's @entity195 , said the apparent thawing of relations increases the prospects for @entity3 talent in the big leagues , " but a lot more must change both in @entity3 and the @entity2 for that to happen			1
" @entity0 's @entity204 contributed to this report .			0

@entity10 is " closely monitoring " @entity208 's plans to normalize diplomatic relations with @entity95
