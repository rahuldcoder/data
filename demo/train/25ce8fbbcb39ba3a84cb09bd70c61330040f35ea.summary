-- it was a wonderful life			0
that 's how @entity3 describes her partnership with @entity6			1
theirs was not a fleeting romance -- the women were together 42 years sharing ups and downs , laughs and tears			1
they also shared what they 'd earned together , including from @entity3 's job as a programmer with @entity18 and @entity19 's work as a psychologist			1
" we were mildly affluent and extremely happy , " @entity3 said			1
" we were like most couples			0
" but even after they married in 2007 in @entity24 , some 40 years into their courtship , the two women were not " like most couples " in the eyes of the state of @entity29 , where they lived , nor in the eyes of the @entity33 government , which under the @entity34 mandates that a spouse , as legally defined , must be a person of the opposite sex			1
this fact hit @entity3 hard in 2009 , while in a hospital after suffering a heart attack a month after @entity6 's death			1
as she recovered and mourned , @entity3 realized she faced a hefty bill for inheritance taxes -- $ 363,053 more than was warranted , she later claimed in court -- because @entity6 was , in legal terms , little more than a friend			1
" it was incredible indignation , " @entity3 recalled feeling			1
" just the numbers were so cruel			0
" this anger gave way to action			0
why , she and her lawyers argued , should her relationship with @entity6 be any different when it came to rights , taxes and more than a heterosexual couple ? why should @entity3 have to pay , literally , for losing her soulmate -- even though , by 2009 , @entity29 courts had recognized that " foreign same - sex marriages " should be recognized in the state as valid ? in october , @entity3 , now 83 , got an answer in the form of a ruling opinion from the 2nd @entity33 @entity67			1
that court found , in her favor , that the @entity34 violates the @entity72 's equal protection clause and thus she should n't have had to pay an inheritance tax after her partner 's death			1
this follows a similar ruling , in may , from another federal appeals court in @entity80			0
federal appeals court strikes down @entity34 neither opinion settles the matter for good			0
that is expected to happen next year when the @entity85 will weigh the constitutionality of the @entity34 through the prism of @entity3 and @entity6 's story			1
it is one of two cases related to same - sex marriage that the high court will consider , it announced friday			0
the other addresses @entity95 's @entity94			0
even with those cases still to be decided , @entity3 said earlier this fall -- when the lower court decided in her favor , three years after @entity6 's death -- that she felt she could finally breathe and celebrate			1
it was a day she relished , and one she did n't entirely expect after all her heartache			0
" what i 'm feeling is elated , " @entity3 said			1
" did i ever think it could come to be , altogether ? ... not a chance in hell			0
" instant chemistry in @entity107 born in @entity108 in 1929 , on the eve of the @entity110 , @entity3 graduated from @entity111 and earned a master 's degree , in 1957 , from @entity113 , according to a fall 2011 story in the latter school 's alumni magazine			2
she had come to @entity29 hoping for a fresh start after a brief marriage , according to the report			2
and professionally , she found it -- working for @entity113 's math department and soon entering data into its @entity123 , one of a few dozen of the huge commercial computers then in operation			0
her knack for programming eventually helped her land a job , and to excel , at @entity18			0
but something was missing in her life , personally			0
or , as @entity3 put it more succinctly , " i suddenly could n't take it anymore			1
" in the documentary " @entity136 and @entity6 : @entity140 , " she recalled pleading with an old friend to take her " where the lesbians go			2
" and so @entity3 spent one friday night at @entity141 , a restaurant in @entity29 's @entity107			1
" somebody brought @entity6 over and introduced her			2
and we ended up dancing , " she recalled			0
" and we immediately just fit , " added @entity6 , on the documentary			2
timeline : same - sex marriage after reuniting two years later , according to their @entity152 ' wedding announcement , their connection proved deep and lasting			0
in 1967 , @entity6 proposed marriage with a round diamond pin			2
a year later , they purchased a house together in @entity157 , according to the @entity159 story			0
yet while the gay rights ' movement took off after the 1969 @entity162 , which occurred while @entity3 and @entity6 were vacationing in @entity163 , an actual marriage -- a legal union -- seemed out of the question			1
marriage , at last , and then heartache regardless , their love remained strong			0
on the documentary , filmed around 2007 , @entity6 said , " each one of us , in fact , looks different from how we looked when we met			1
but if i look at @entity175 now , she looks exactly the same to me			0
" @entity3 had halted her new career as a gay rights activist to help care for her partner , who suffered from multiple sclerosis			2
and it was after getting a " bad prognosis ( that ) i had another year to live and that was it " that @entity6 proposed again			1
" and i said yes , " @entity3 recalled			2
" she said , ' so do @entity183 ' " video shows @entity6 being pushed through the airport in her wheelchair			2
it was from that seat -- on may 22 , 2007 , at @entity24 's @entity189 -- that she gave her vows to make their marriage official in @entity192			1
" i , @entity3 , choose you , @entity3 , to be my lawful , wedded spouse , " she said			2
" for richer and for poorer , in sickness and in health , until death do us part			0
" having happily gone four decades without , @entity3 soon realized how much the marriage meant to her			2
it made her and @entity6 's love legitimate and all the more real			0
" it 's different because somewhere you 're a hidden person , and suddenly you 're a citizen of the world , " she said in october			0
but what happened as @entity6 's condition worsened , and after her death , proved a stark reminder they were not legally united in their own country			1
and the fact that @entity29 legalized same - sex marriage in 2011 did n't mean that @entity3 , for example , would suddenly get back the hundreds of thousands of dollars in inheritance tax that she 'd given to the government			1
that could happen , however , if the @entity85 upholds the appeals court ruling			1
that is @entity3 's hope , as is that whether a committed couple is heterosexual or homosexual becomes irrelevant within the next decade			0
in the meantime , @entity3 said she 's proud to fight for something bigger than herself and the legitimacy of her union with @entity6			1
she hopes , through her struggle , to help make it so gay teenagers can " fall in love knowing there 's a future , " that children of gay couples wo n't feel the need to explain their families , and that homophobia becomes a thing of the past			0
" i feel like i 'm representing them			0

@entity3 and @entity3 met in @entity29 and were together more than 40 years
they could n't legally marry in the @entity33 , but they did tie the knot in 2007 in @entity24
when @entity6 died , @entity3 paid a large inheritance tax -- then fought it in court
a court rules their union was valid ; the @entity85 will take up the case next year
