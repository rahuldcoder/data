@entity0 -- clad in brown trench coats , dark glasses and trilby hats , what appear to be three secret agents huddle around a payphone box with listening equipment			1
it 's not a 1950s film scene but the latest street art attributed to @entity13 's famously anonymous graffiti artist @entity12			1
the image -- apparently a comment on the issue of government surveillance -- appeared early sunday , local media said , on a house wall in the provincial @entity21 spa town of @entity22 , in @entity23			2
the location may be a reference to the town 's role as host to @entity13 's @entity29 , known as @entity29 -- the @entity13 equivalent of the @entity31			1
the @entity31 has been at the center of the spying row sparked by revelations by its former contractor @entity35 about the extent of government surveillance			0
some leaked documents also make a reference to @entity29 , although the @entity13 government says the listening agency operates only within a strict framework of controls			1
asked about the image , a spokeswoman for @entity29 said , " this is the first time we have ever been asked to comment on art. although we are not qualified critics , we are as intrigued as the rest of the residents of @entity22 about the appearance of the mysterious artwork			1
" for those who are interested , our website gives a glimpse of what modern day intelligence operatives are really like , although some may be disappointed by the lack of trench coats and dark glasses			1
" @entity63 , who reportedly lives in the house , told the @entity66 newspaper , " it 's pretty good			0
it livens the street up a bit			0
there have been a lot of people about today looking at it			0
" the artwork emerged a day before the @entity77 and @entity78 arm of @entity79 were awarded a @entity80 for their reporting on the @entity31 revelations , described as " marked by authoritative and insightful reports that helped the public understand how the disclosures fit into the larger framework of national security			0
" @entity12 's own website makes no reference to the artwork			2
it instead features what appears to be a new artwork showing a man and a woman apparently embracing but each looking over the other 's shoulder at a smartphone -- perhaps a comment on our modern - day addiction to technological devices			0
@entity12 's last high - profile project was a month - long street art " residency " in @entity107			1
each day of october , @entity12 unveiled new works of art around @entity107			2
the works were then announced on his website and posted to @entity112			0
many of the surprise exhibits followed his signature street - art style : stencils spray - painted on streets , walls of buildings and under bridges			2
