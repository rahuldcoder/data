it 's just an amazing legacy that he 's left behind			0

" @entity7 told the @entity184 this month he felt inadequate to deal with the initial allegation of abuse against @entity110			1
" i did n't know exactly how to handle it and i was afraid to do something that might jeopardize what the university procedure was , " @entity7 told the @entity184			2
" so i backed away and turned it over to some other people , people i thought would have a little more expertise than i did			0
it did n't work out that way			0
" the former coach spoke with a raspy voice during the interview -- @entity7 's first extensive comments since being fired			1

" he said he had gone to @entity60 with what he saw			0

@entity210 and @entity211 , a former university vice president , have been charged with perjury and failure to report the abuse allegations , which law enforcement did not learn about for several years			0
they have pleaded not guilty			0
" you know , he did n't want to get specific , " @entity7 said about @entity200			2
" and to be frank with you i do n't know that it would have done any good , because i never heard of , of , rape and a man			0
so i just did what i thought was best			0
i talked to people that i thought would be , if there was a problem , that would be following up on it , " he told the @entity184			0
