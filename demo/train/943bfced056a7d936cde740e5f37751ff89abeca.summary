@entity3 a pillar of president @entity2 's global anti-terrorism strategy is in peril as sectarian chaos consumes @entity7 , a vital @entity8 ally where chronic instability allows the deadliest surviving @entity11 franchise to flourish			1
@entity13 - backed rebels of the @entity16 @entity15 sect sparked alarm in @entity3 after seizing a presidential palace in the volatile sunni - majority nation , in what officials called a coup			1
there are now signs that the rebels -- which have been resistant to @entity8 anti-terror efforts despite a common antipathy to @entity11 -- and the @entity8 - backed government of president @entity29 have agreed a deal to end the crisis			1
but the situation remains volatile and a reminder of how the intricate , shifting and treacherous tribal and sectarian divides of the @entity34 often confound @entity8 efforts to frame coherent anti-terror policy			1
@entity2 has spent much of his administration sponsoring a political transition designed to restore stability in @entity7 and to cap the sectarianism that sustains @entity42 ( @entity42 )			1
@entity3 has offered counter-terrorism training to the government in the @entity7 capital @entity46 and has also mounted a campaign of drone strikes against key @entity42 leaders			1
the group is regarded by @entity8 officials as the most potent offspring of @entity54 's jihadist movement and has claimed responsibility for the attack on the @entity58 satirical magazine @entity57 this month			1
@entity42 also almost succeeded in bringing down a @entity8 commercial jet over @entity60 on christmas day 2009 , and has tried to attack the @entity8 mainland on at least two other occasions			1
the group 's potential was underlined in a video released on wednesday in which a senior leader of @entity42 in @entity7 , @entity67 , said it was better for jihadists to wage war in their home nations , rather than fighting on the front lines in @entity73			2
the message will alarm @entity80 governments fearful that @entity75 extremists radicalized at home or who have fought in @entity73 , @entity78 or @entity7 are plotting new attacks in the wake of the @entity85 carnage			2
related : @entity7 government , rebels reach tentative agreement , source says @entity4 's @entity90 reported that meanwhile , @entity91 -- @entity11 's jihadist rival -- was now also beginning to establish a presence in the country			1
@entity7 , which borders the @entity95 and the strategically important @entity96 -- a major oil transit route -- sits next to key @entity8 allies , @entity100 and @entity99			1
but it is also important rhetorically for the @entity2 administration			0
in a speech in september on combating @entity91 , @entity2 held up @entity8 operations in @entity7 as an example for a new anti-terror doctrine which does not rely on sending troops into dangerous foreign quagmires			1
" this strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us , while supporting partners on the front lines , is one that we have successfully pursued in @entity7 and @entity115 for years , " @entity2 said			2
@entity2 vowed to use " force against anyone who threatens @entity8 's core interests , but to mobilize partners wherever possible to address broader challenges to international order			2
" the obvious problem with that strategy is that it needs secure , powerful local partners to have a hope of working			0
in failed states like @entity73 and @entity7 , those partners often do not exist , or are , like @entity29 , are deeply vulnerable			2
@entity126 , a former career foreign service officer , who served as @entity8 ambassador to @entity7 between 2007 and 2010 , said the current situation was bad news for the @entity131			1
" the @entity29 government has been a good partner of ours in the counter-terrorism arena , " he said			0
" if you move president @entity29 from the equation , then i think all bets are off in many respects			0
" after fighting raged in the streets of @entity46 , and a @entity8 diplomatic vehicle was caught in the crossfire , the @entity141 moved two ships within range of the country in case the @entity149 gives the order for an evacuation of the embassy			2
with memories of the raid by extremists on @entity8 compounds in @entity158 on sept. 11 , 2012 , which killed four @entity8 still haunting the administration , and fears of a hostage drama , no one wants to take chances			2

" if we were forced to close down in @entity46 , the embassy , this would be a major foreign policy defeat , " @entity4 intelligence analyst @entity171 told @entity172			0
" we need a government in that country to crack down on @entity11			2
you can not do this from the air , or the @entity181 [ can not just ] intercept intelligence			0
" we need a strong central government -- whether it is a @entity15 one or an independent one			2
" @entity131 spokesman @entity184 said wednesday that the safety of embassy personnel in @entity46 was a top priority			0
he also made clear that preserving anti-terror cooperation in @entity7 was also vital			1
but the long - term @entity8 diplomatic posture in @entity7 is unclear			1
the fact that @entity11 is a common enemy of @entity3 and the @entity15 raises the intriguing suggestion of possible cooperation			1
but any tie up would likely be tacit and covert , and @entity3 would have trouble publicly recognizing any @entity15 regime			2
@entity197 , a spokesman for the @entity7 embassy in @entity3 said , " @entity8 should care about the @entity15			1
" " we need to find out a way for the @entity15 and the government to co-exist ... they are now a fact of life , " he told @entity4			0
@entity204 , an expert on @entity7 and professor at @entity206 , said the fallout from the apparent coup against @entity29 was a mixed bag for the @entity8			1
" the @entity15 are virulently anti-al @entity11			1
they have gone after @entity11 like no one has before			0
there is a certain coincidence of interest with the @entity8 with the @entity15 against @entity11 , " he said			1
" the @entity15 have done nothing to even slightly irritate the @entity8			1
they have been very careful not to do anything like that			0
the @entity8 are very much leaving the door open			0
" @entity219 , an adviser on @entity34 and @entity220 for @entity221 , a global intelligence and advisory firm , said that the @entity15 movement could not be ignored			0
" it is not clear to me to what extent @entity3 has relations with the @entity15 movement			0
but now effectively the @entity15 are kingmakers			0
while they do not dominate @entity7 , they control the largest piece of real estate and they are the single - largest group , " @entity219 said			0
the level of @entity13 's support for the @entity15 movement , beyond rhetorical backing is in question			0
@entity237 's intelligence resources are already stretched by the @entity73 crisis and its finances have been hampered by western nuclear sanctions and the fall in the price of oil			0
@entity13 , however , has spent years spreading its influence throughout the region in its wider proxy battle with its rival @entity100 , an important @entity8 ally , and now sponsors or heavily influences governments or key political forces in @entity251 , @entity252 and @entity253 , as well as @entity46			0
the complex web of tribal and sectarian forces scrambling alliances and traditional alliances in @entity7 represent the region in microcosm and reflects massive challenges facing @entity8 officials in search of a working policy			1
" we do n't have a lot of leverage in there at the moment , " @entity126 said			0
" there are so many forces and counter forces at play -- none of which we or anyone controls effectively , " he said			0
" there are currents and issues and long standing hostility they are going to have to work themselves to some extent			0
" as violence flares , 7 things to know about @entity7			0
