@entity0 does n't know what a new court - appointed independent doctor will say about her daughter , who was declared brain dead after tonsil surgery this month			1
but she has no doubt about one thing : her plan to keep fighting for her daughter to stay on life support			1
" i 'm her mother			0
i 'm going to support her			1
it 's my job to do it			1
any mother would do it , " @entity0 said in an exclusive interview with @entity18 's @entity17 on monday			1
" i just want her to have more time			1
there are so many stories of people waking up in her situation			0
" doctors at @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29 , have said 13 - year - old @entity30 is brain dead and wo n't wake up			1
" we have the deepest sympathy for @entity30 's mother , who wishes her daughter was alive ; but the ventilator can not reverse the brain death that has occurred and it would be wrong to give false hope that @entity30 will ever come back to life , " dr. @entity32 , the hospital 's chief of pediatrics , said in a statement on monday			1
@entity30 was declared brain dead december 12 , three days after the surgery			1
the case has drawn national attention and sparked protests from some local leaders who say the hospital should have provided better care			0
on monday , a judge appointed dr. @entity52 , chief of pediatric neurology at @entity54 , to evaluate @entity30			1
@entity52 is expected to testify on the case in a closed hearing tuesday , according to court documents			1
@entity58 judge @entity57 also ruled that the hospital must hold off on any decisions regarding discontinuing life support until december 30			1
and he encouraged both sides to work together			0
" this is a very , very charged case			0
the stakes are very high			0
there is a young girl involved , and i think it would suit both parties well if you would speak with each other about how we are going to get through the next few days , " @entity57 said			2
ultimately , the fight pits the family 's faith against what the hospital calls false hope			2
@entity0 told @entity18 monday that she 's seen recent improvements in her daughter 's condition			2
a hospital monitor suggests her daughter is trying to breathe on her own , she said			0
" they told me without your brain , you ca n't take your own breath , " @entity0 said			2
" well , she 's trying , so that means something 's working			2
" @entity0 said the memory of watching her daughter bleeding profusely after the surgery remains seared in her mind			2
the hospital has n't done enough to explain to her what went wrong , she said			0
" they have not given me a reason yet of why she went into cardiac arrest			0
they have n't even given me a reason for her bleeding			0
they have n't given me a reason that they could n't stop the bleeding , " she said			0
" the only thing they keep pushing for me is to get her off their ventilator			0
" @entity32 said monday that hospital officials are looking into the matter and are " committed to learning what led to this catastrophic outcome			0
" " we are sorry that @entity30 suffered tragic complications from her complex surgery , " he said			1
" our hearts go out to the grieving family and community about this sad situation			0
we look forward to the independent expert 's evaluation of the patient			1
" @entity127 , an attorney for the hospital , told the judge that @entity30 could n't be brought back to life			1
" this is obviously a tragic situation , " he said			0
" a young lady has died and no one takes that in a callous or uncaring manner , but she is dead			2
" @entity0 , meanwhile , said she still has faith			0
" i will not stop fighting for @entity30 , because , like i said , i see signs of improvement , " she said			1
" i really feel that my child needs time to heal			2

" i just want her to have more time , " @entity30 's mom says
the 13 - year - old is on life support after tonsil surgery
an independent , court - appointed doctor will evaluate her
