the search for employment is a daily struggle for 24 - year - old @entity12			2
he 's one of millions of young unemployed @entity8 whose lives have stalled , despite economic growth across the continent			1
@entity12 lives in @entity17 , where until recently he was pursuing a university education			1
the revolution that ousted @entity20 forced him out of school and into a job market , which has continued to worsen			0
the uprising kept tourists away and investors out -- and @entity17 is yet to recover			1
around 30 % of 18 to 29 - year - olds are now out of work -- a figure that 's echoed across @entity8			1

" now there are no jobs whatsoever , " he said			0
" i 've tried working in restaurants , coffee shops , clothing stores and lately worked at my brother 's store			1
but the wages are not sustainable at all			0
" thousands of miles away in @entity42 , more disillusioned young adults walk the corridors of the @entity44			1
unlike @entity12 , they 'll get to complete their studies and enter the job market as skilled professionals			0
but with @entity42 's youth unemployment rate standing at 40 % , they feel their prospects of work are equally slim			1
@entity52 is a promising student on the campus			2
she said : " i 'm competing with around 700 people to get the same job , probably in the same place			0

" she places the blame firmly at the feet of her government			0

the other point is the rest of the world is aging , so @entity8 will become the place with all the young people			1
" the @entity84 report also speaks of the importance of unlocking the potential offered by the region 's youth			2
but it says the continent must modernize its industries and develop sustainable private sectors , in order to do so			0
