-- he was born in the @entity2 -- and @entity4 's @entity3 will be hoping to mix it with a certain mr @entity6 once again after rewriting the history books at @entity8			1
while most teenagers take on @entity10 on their game consoles , @entity4 's @entity3 was busy making history friday after becoming the youngest ever player to make the cut at a major championship			1
the 14 - year - old overcame a controversial slow play penalty to qualify for the weekend 's action after carding a three - over 75 to leave him four - over for the tournament			1
at 14 years and five months , @entity3 breaks the record held by @entity22 's @entity21 , who made history at the @entity24 at the age of 16 years and two months			1
@entity3 was n't even born when @entity6 became the youngest ever player to win the masters at the age of 21 back in 1997 , but the two shared a practice round earlier this week with the teenager looking far from overawed			1
he kept his cool on a difficult day where his participation in the final two rounds hung by a thread , after he was penalized on the 17th hole following a failure to heed the warnings given by referee @entity39			0
@entity3 is the first player to be punished for slow play in a major since @entity43 's @entity42 at the 2010 @entity44 leader @entity45 , who finished on six - under , could have ended the youngster 's hopes had he managed to gain one more shot			1
but the @entity49 finished with a round of 68 to finish one clear of @entity51 and fellow countryman @entity52			1
" i respect the decision they make , " @entity3 told reporters following his round			1
" i just changed my routine before the masters , and the routine is good , but i think today is pretty hard because if you 're timed only 40 seconds , it 's pretty hard because you need to make the decision			2
the wind switched a lot			0
but that 's for everybody			0
" @entity3 's problems began on the 13th where he was given a warning following his second shot , before he was hit with a one - shot penalty on the 17th			1
the decision split players and fans alike with two - time winner @entity76 coming to the youngster 's defense			2
" this is n't going to end up pretty , i do n't think , " @entity79 told reporters			0
" i 'm sick for him			0
he 's 14 years old ... when you get the wind blowing out here , believe me , you 're going to change your mind a lot			2
" i 'm sorry , i 'm a player			0
it is not easy to get around this golf course the way it 's set up for two days			0
" @entity93 's @entity92 , who finished three shots off the lead on three - under , also backed @entity3			1
" he 's a youngster just learning the game and it 's his first professional tournament , it seems a little bit harsh to me , " @entity92 told reporters			2
" he probably learned to play slowly after watching us professional golfers on tv , so why should we be surprised ? " while there was a great deal of sympathy for the talented teenager , 1992 champion @entity51 says the decision was the correct one			0
" the soft - coated answer would be i feel bad , but i also feel like they just do n't go around handing out one - shot penalties here , " he told reporters			1
" i do n't even know of anyone who has ever got one			0
" it feels hard to give a 14 - year - old a penalty , but he 's in the field			1
he beat a lot of guys yesterday , whatever the age he is			0
" at the top of the leaderboard , @entity45 will hope to finally end @entity49 's wait for a masters champion			1
the 25 - year - old finished second in 2011 but produced a sublime round of 68 to ensure his place at the top of the leaderboard			1
@entity6 had looked set to finish towards the top only for an outrageous piece of misfortune to cost him at the 15th			2
the @entity134 hit his third shot onto the par - five 15th only for it to hit the stick and rebound into the pond			2
woods finished on three - under alongside the likes of @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity49 's @entity142 amongst others			1
meanwhile , @entity144 will have title aspirations of his own after hitting a two - under 70 to leave him right in the mix. the 23 - year - old , ranked second in the world , carded a level - par round of 72 on thursday but produced a much improved performance during his second round			2
" i made a lot of good putts for pars on the front nine , " he told reporters			0
" i mean i did n't play my best for the first few holes and the eighth hole ( eagle ) really got me going , really kick started me			0
" then i started to hit some really good quality shots			0
i took advantage of a couple of easier holes on the back nine , 13 , 14			0
" anything under par today was going to be a good score and i stayed patient out there when i needed to and it was a good day			0
" i 'm comfortable with my game , i 'm happy with this position going into the weekend , " he said			0
defending champion @entity171 made the cut by the skin of his teeth after carding a one - over 73			2
@entity171 is five - over for the tournament and in a tie for 55th place			0
