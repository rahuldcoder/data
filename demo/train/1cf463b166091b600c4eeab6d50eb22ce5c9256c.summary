parenting is not at the heart of the issue , despite expectations @entity41 would be more flexible after the recent birth of her first child			0
in the thousands of social media posts made about @entity41 's decision since monday , people have attempted to classify the policy as a statement about everything from feminism to incompetent management			1
on tuesday @entity16 issued a short statement , saying " this is n't a broad industry view on working from home -- this is about what is right for @entity16 right now			1
" but two themes seem to anchor the discussion , and they center on debate about what it takes to create a truly innovate workplace -- something @entity16 needs -- and the role morale plays in productivity			1

" a work - at - home mom defends @entity41 on productivity @entity126 , founder of @entity127 , quickly posted his opposition to @entity41 's policy , saying a big part of successfully working with other people depends on , " trusting people to get their work done wherever they are , without supervision			1

second , @entity16 now risks losing top performers , and third the policy speaks of control and distrust unlikely to boost morale and engagement			1
