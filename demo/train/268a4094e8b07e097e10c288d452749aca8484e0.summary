-- finding a partner in crime when it comes to navigating your love life can be challenging			0
girlfriends tend to be over-supportive ( " i think he 's really into you -- it 's only been a month since your last date			1
give him time to call			0
mom and dad can be overprotective and judgmental ( " independent consultant is a fancy way to say unemployed			0
and then ... there 's grandma -- a wealth of knowledge and experience , and someone who 's already landed a man once			1
@entity0 : how to know it 's real love which is exactly why @entity27 , 24 , turned to her @entity28 , 75 , when she decided to jump into the online dating scene in @entity30 -- especially since @entity28 ( who lives over 1500 miles away in @entity31 ) is playing the digital dating game herself			1
as @entity27 says , " she 's a 24 - hour cocktail party full of jokes , gossip , and advice			2
" to record their triumphs ( and low points ) , which they discuss almost daily over the phone , @entity27 started a blog " granny is my wingman			0
" @entity0 : pacing a relationship : a step - by - step guide to getting it right @entity27 and @entity49 share what they 've learned since they logged on : the profile mistake to avoid : do n't skimp on the details			2
" in most cases less is more , " says @entity28			1
" but when it comes to online dating that 's not necessarily true			1
" as @entity27 explains : " initially , we did n't share enough information about ourselves or the qualities we 're looking for in future partners			1
we thought we were coming across as mysterious , but i think men probably saw us as vague or boring			0
" if it 's not working , do n't give up -- switch sites : just as in the real world , some locations are better for meeting potential partners than others			1
granny recently left @entity70 for @entity71			0
" the pool of men is much smaller for people of my age and @entity76 has more guys in my area , " she says , " as soon as i signed on , i attracted more messages and online winks			0
" project the right image : @entity27 's sister -- an @entity84 success story -- told her that people who have pictures of their faces rather than full - body shots get more clicks , so granny and granddaughter both opt for headshots on their profile pages			2
@entity0 : 11 reasons to worship your body ( and his ) how the dating rules have changed : " i 'm learning that men expect a woman to be more forward , " @entity28 says , which includes calling him			1
" you have to be more aggressive , show more chutzpah , " she adds			0
another observation she 's made -- especially within her granddaughter 's generation -- is that sex is now part of the program			1
" i 'm not promoting promiscuity , " she says , " but if the sex is bad , why go further ? " one thing they 'll never discuss : @entity114 , gritty bedroom details			2
" that would be weird , " says @entity27			0
the ultimate deal - breaker : for @entity27 : " a topless photo [ of a potential suitor ] taken in a mirror while flexing and sporting a kissy - face			0
i come across them way more than you 'd think			0
" for @entity28 , it 's a show - off , " he is dead wrong if he thinks i care about the kitschy list of homes he owns , " she says			1
but a cheap man does n't do it for her either : " a few months ago i was set up with an old fart who did n't want to pick me up because of the price of gas			2
then he wanted to meet me at a quarter to six so we could make the early bird special , " @entity28 says , " when i ordered a second glass of wine he looked at me and asked , ' are you sure ? ' i was positive			1
" @entity140 : a grandmother of 12 goes on a memorable first date the # 1 thing @entity27 has learned from @entity28 : " she taught me to be more relaxed and open to new encounters , " says @entity27 , " she 's always preaching that i 'm young and need to take advantage of this time in my life and the options that are out there			1
" the # 1 thing @entity28 has learned from @entity27 : " she 's always keeping a positive attitude -- i try to adopt her approach , " @entity28 says , " if it 's not fun , do n't do it again , but find the humor in [ the date ] so we can laugh about it after			1
" where they are now : neither granny nor granddaughter have met their match			0
" some guys come off hilarious , attractive , and intelligent online , but then you meet them and they 're total duds that are clearly masters of deception and @entity171 , " says @entity27			2
