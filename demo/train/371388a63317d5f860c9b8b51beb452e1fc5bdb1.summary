if you 're using a fake name on your @entity3 account , maintaining a personal profile for your beloved pet or have a second profile you use just for logging in to other sites , you have one of the 83.09 million fake accounts @entity3 wants to disable			1
in an updated regulatory filing released wednesday , the social media company said that 8.7 percent of its 955 million monthly active users worldwide are actually duplicate or false accounts			1
" on @entity3 we have a really large commitment in general to finding and disabling false accounts , " @entity3 's chief security officer @entity14 told @entity15 in a recent interview			1
" our entire platform is based on people using their real identities			0
" @entity3 inspires status envy so what are those 83 million undesired accounts doing ? they 're a mixture of innocent and malicious , and @entity3 has divvied them up into three categories : duplicate accounts , misclassified accounts and " undesirable " accounts			1
duplicate accounts make up 4.8 % ( 45.8 million ) of @entity3 's total active member tally			1
according to the network 's terms of service , users are not allowed to have more than one @entity3 personal account or make accounts on behalf of other people			2
parents creating @entity3 accounts for their young kids are violating two rules , since people under 13 are not allowed to have @entity3 profiles			2
misclassified accounts are personal profiles that have been made for companies , groups or pets			0
those types of profiles ( 22.9 million ) are allowed on @entity3 , but they need to be created as @entity52			1
@entity3 estimates that 2.4 % of its active accounts are these non-human personal accounts			1
these accounts can be converted into approved pages without losing information			0
pets such as @entity60 , the self - anointed " world 's cutest dog , " are typically classified as @entity63			0
the third group is the smallest -- just 1.5 % of all active accounts -- but most troublesome			2
there are 14.3 million undesirable accounts that @entity3 believes have been created specifically for purposes that violate the companies terms , like spamming			1
face it , @entity3 : sometimes you suck " we believe the percentage of accounts that are duplicate or false is meaningfully lower in developed markets such as the @entity76 or @entity77 and higher in developing markets such as @entity79 and @entity80 , " the company said in the filing			2
the tallies were based on an internal sampling of accounts done by reviewers , and @entity3 says the numbers may represent the actual number			0
@entity3 disables any false accounts it finds , and while it wipes all the information associated with the name from public view , it does n't delete the account from its servers " for safety and security " reasons			0
the disabled account goes into a sort of @entity3 limbo , where the owner of the account ca n't get their hands on any of the content -- photos , posts , videos -- not even by requesting a copy of the data , according to @entity3			0
if @entity3 does shut down your account , it says you ca n't create a new one without permission from the company			0

fake and duplicate profiles and spam accounts make up 8.7 % of @entity3 active pages
@entity3 is always looking for and disabling these types of accounts
