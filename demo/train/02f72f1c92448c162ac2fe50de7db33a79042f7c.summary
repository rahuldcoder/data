are the media reveling in the @entity2 scandal just a bit too much ? the question sort of answers itself			1
journalists are secretly grateful to the former four - star general for rescuing us from six weeks of sober coverage about the fiscal cliff			1
not that anyone wants to plunge over the cliff , but daily reports on @entity14 negotiations with @entity15 are no one 's idea of a wild time			1
so let 's face it : we are wallowing in the tawdriness of this tale			2
but are the media losing perspective -- and rushing to judgment ? let 's concede up front that the story is inherently fascinating			1
a general with a walk - on - water reputation abruptly quits the @entity32 and admits an extramarital affair			1
his mistress turns out to be his admiring biographer , who hawked her book all over television			0
watch : an orgy of media advice on getting away with an affair then we learn that she triggered an @entity44 probe by sending what were perceived as harassing e-mails to a military volunteer in @entity48 -- and that a friendly @entity44 agent allegedly sent that woman shirtless photos			1
all of which was a prelude to the reports that gen. @entity55 , who in his spare time is running the war in @entity58 , exchanged up to 30,000 e-mails with said @entity48 woman			0
see ? it 's hard to keep up			2
the military sex saga has all the earmarks of a sizzling soap opera			0
but let 's take a step back			2
a couple of steps , in fact			0
those 30,000 e-mails initially described by sources as " flirtatious " ? unnamed defense officials put out the word the next day that there were far fewer -- maybe a few hundred , one told the @entity76 -- and that there was " no affair " between @entity55 and @entity79 , the @entity48 activist			2
or perhaps they were " overly flirtatious , " anonymous @entity81 officials told the @entity82 , and there were 30,000 pages but some just contained a single sentence			0
and @entity55 may have called @entity79 " sweetheart " in the e-mails , reports the @entity88			0
watch : media mistakes murky in @entity2 sex scandal as for the e-mails from @entity93 , @entity2 ' biographer , to @entity79 , i 've seen them described as everything from threatening to harassing to chastising @entity79 for acting like a " seductress " toward @entity2			1
again , we do n't really know			0
what about the notion that @entity93 was terribly indiscreet in her relationship with @entity2 ? her ghostwriter , the @entity76 's @entity101 , says he was " clueless " about any affair			1
there is , to be sure , a practical problem here			0
the principals are n't talking much			0
new information and insinuations tend to trickle out through friends , associates and officials - speaking - on - background , which leaves a sizable void that has sometimes been filled by speculation			2
nor have journalists covered themselves with glory by staking out the women 's homes			1
@entity79 has called local police asking for " diplomatic protection " against the media mob that has camped out near her residence , according to the @entity124 station in @entity125			2
what , exactly , did she do to warrant this treatment ? watch : @entity127 retreats from piece on b - schools with hottest women now we come to the heart of the matter			0
@entity2 , who has risked his life and been wounded as a soldier , showed bad judgment and fooled around			2
that 's not exactly an aberration in the highest levels of politics			0
perhaps you recall the name @entity143 , now a global statesman			0
so what is driving the story ? why has the press devoted far more attention to @entity2 ' personal life than , say , his agency 's role in the fatal attack in @entity153 ? our culture tends to put generals on a pedestal , and none more so than @entity2 , who courted journalists assiduously and received favorable coverage in return			1
the mighty media machine turned @entity2 into a household name , and now his image is crumbling beneath the weight of that machine			1
the fame he sought is being used against him			0
if the secretary of commerce gets caught carrying on with a smitten young woman , it 's a two - day story			1
some commentators who opposed @entity2 ' role in @entity176 's surge in @entity177 are using his fall from grace to settle scores			1
and do n't ignore the pop - culture element , swirling around this question : if the nation 's top spy ca n't keep an affair secret , who can ? but we have reached the point where the enormity of the media spectacle far exceeds the news value of the revelation that one of @entity194 's top military leaders was also a flawed human being			1
watch : jezebel crusade against teens ' racist @entity198 tweet turns harsh			0

@entity201 : journalists happy @entity2 affair knocked " fiscal cliff " off front page
@entity201 : media quick to report *salacious* details that proved to be not so *dramatic*
*people* eat story up because it involves a well - respected general , he says
@entity201 : media has *jumped* the shark beyond the story 's newsworthiness
