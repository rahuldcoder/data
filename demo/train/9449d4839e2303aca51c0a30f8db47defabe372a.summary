-- @entity1 likes to give enigmatic names to the extraordinarily beautiful photographs she shoots of crumbling palaces			1
but that 's not where the enigma of her work ends			0
despite creating alluring images of abandoned buildings , she 's determined to keep their locations a mystery			1
" places reflect our soul , tell the forgotten story of love , disaster , war , as well as ordinary life , " @entity1 , a former history teacher from @entity15 , tells @entity0 as she tries to explain her shroud of secrecy			1
" everything passes , even the power of past times is often forgotten			2
and that 's why i do n't give any addresses , because often these places are destroyed and devastated , it 's better for them to have been forgotten			2
" not , however , forgotten by @entity1 's cameras			1
she uses old analog @entity36 photo equipment and lenses , plus some more modern @entity39 and @entity40 equipment to create images that pay homage to the original grandeur of these baroque structures			2
with otherworldly titles such as " @entity47 " and " @entity48 , " her photographs have an unrealistic quality more closely associated with paintings -- but the incredible detail on display would take more than a lifetime 's worth of brushstrokes to recreate			0
swirling spiral staircases the images show vast ornate ballrooms , swirling spiral staircases and elegant chapels strewn with rubble			1
sunlight shafts bore in through broken windows or holes in roofs			0
sometimes an abandoned toy or chair adds a poignant human touch to the dereliction			2
@entity1 , who lives in @entity70 , took up photography about 12 years ago			1
her first subject was a ruined medieval castle in the southern @entity15 town of @entity75			0
during stays in the @entity77 and @entity78 she says she realized there was " magic " in forgotten places and began seeking them out in her home country			2
finding her subjects takes effort , she says			0
" the location of these places is hard work , the research involves maps , historical books and old guides , and talking to people who live in the areas of the buildings			1
" her refusal to identify where these buildings will at least prevent them from becoming " ruin porn " destinations -- a status deplored by some places trying shake off economic decline			0
@entity1 , who now works in it , says she has been inspired by people 's reactions to her work into pursuing further projects			1
on her list is nature photography -- " mountains , meadows and sea " -- and documenting " @entity115 , " the sometimes risky global trend of urban exploration that occasionally involves trespassing on dangerous structures			0
she also wants to tackle human subjects			0
" this would be a breakthrough for me because so far my work has n't involved any people or portraits			0

former history teacher @entity1 *specializes* in photographing dereliction
@entity1 refuses to reveal the location of the buildings , saying they should be forgotten
her images show vast ornate ballrooms , swirling spiral staircases and elegant chapels strewn with rubble
