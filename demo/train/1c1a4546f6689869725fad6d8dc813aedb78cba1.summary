rebels gave @entity3 officials the data recorders from downed @entity5 on tuesday , days after the passenger jet crashed in eastern @entity6			1
" we believe these are the black boxes and these boxes will reveal the truth , " said @entity7 , the self - declared rebel prime minister in @entity8			1
it was a significant step forward in an investigation that 's been stalled for days , but key questions remained unanswered : will the black boxes give investigators the clues they need ? what will happen to the bodies of the plane crash 's 298 victims , many of which are being kept in refrigerated train cars ? and who pulled the trigger to bring the plane down ? speaking to international reporters invited to watch the handover at the headquarters of the @entity32 rebel movement early tuesday , @entity7 said the separatists had done their best to retrieve bodies and handle wreckage at the crash site			1
and he denied accusations that rebels shot down the plane			0
" this is an information war , " he said			0
" we do n't have the technical ability to destroy this plane			0
@entity6 are not interested in the truth			1
" col. @entity43 of the @entity3 military thanked him			1
" having the black box is not to blame each other , " he said , " but to show the @entity3 that we are so serious that these things be recovered for @entity3			1
" the long - awaited handover came hours after @entity6 president @entity50 and @entity52 president @entity51 lashed out monday at @entity53 over conditions at the crash site of @entity56 17 , saying @entity53 - backed rebels were still impeding efforts to find out exactly what happened			1
what will black boxes reveal ? the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder , known as the black boxes , could provide key information about what happened to the plane , analysts told @entity69			1
but is it possible the rebels tampered with them before handing them over ? " you ca n't go and fool around with the data			0
these are solid , secure devices , " said @entity75 , former @entity76 managing director			0
" if there was any kind of attempt to alter them , investigators would know immediately			0
" the voice recorder could include audio from the cockpit , which would show whether the pilots knew the plane had been hit , said @entity89 , a @entity69 aviation analyst and former inspector general for the @entity52 @entity91			0
and the flight data recorder will give investigators information about engine settings , pressurization and electronic communications , among other details , she said			0
but that does n't mean the black boxes hold all the clues to explain what happened to the @entity103			1
" the black boxes are n't going to solve " the issue of who downed the @entity3 airliner , a @entity52 intelligence official told @entity69 's @entity105			1
handling the remains the remains of 16 people were still missing monday , four days after @entity5 plunged to the ground , @entity50 told @entity69 's @entity113			2
earlier , the @entity6 government issued a statement saying that 282 bodies and 87 " body fragments " had been recovered from the sprawling crash site			1
a train carrying the remains of 282 passengers was headed toward the eastern city of @entity124 , officials said monday			1
@entity51 and @entity50 decried how the bodies had been treated , echoing complaints that the remains had been left exposed to the elements for days and that rebels had stripped personal belongings from some of the bodies and their effects			1
@entity50 said the rebels ' conduct was " barbaric			0
" @entity51 called the handling of remains an " insult " that has " no place in the community of nations			2
" @entity146 forensics experts who inspected the train monday were " more or less " satisfied with how the bodies were being stored , " said @entity142 , the spokesman for monitors from the @entity144			1
after the train arrives in @entity124 , the remains will be flown to @entity152 on board a @entity146 @entity154 , officials have said			1
most of those who died in the crash were from the @entity146			1
@entity146 foreign minister @entity158 said bringing the victims ' remains home is his country 's top priority			1
" to my dying day , i will not understand that it took so much time for the rescue workers to be allowed to do their difficult jobs , " he told the @entity163 on monday , " and that human remains should be used in a political game			1
" who pulled the trigger ? the @entity163 adopted a resolution monday demanding full access to the crash site and condemning the downing of the plane			0
the resolution won unanimous approval from the 15 - member council , which includes @entity53			0
it did not specify who was responsible for the crash			0
@entity52 and other officials have said it appears the plane was shot down by a sophisticated surface - to - air missile located within rebel - held territory			1
evidence supporting that conclusion includes telephone intercepts purporting to be @entity32 rebels discussing the shootdown and video of a @entity195 missile launcher traveling into @entity53 with at least one missile missing			0
while they have stopped short of putting the responsibility squarely on @entity53 , @entity51 , @entity200 prime minister @entity199 and others have said the @entity32 rebels could not have shot such a high - flying jet down without weapons and training from @entity53			2
but officials said monday that @entity52 intelligence analysts are examining phone intercepts , social media posts and information gathered on the ground to see if @entity53 officials played a direct role in the shootdown , according to two @entity52 officials directly familiar with the latest assessment			2
the officials declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation			0
" we are trying to determine if they manned it , advised , or pulled the trigger , " one of the officials told @entity69			0
@entity50 , speaking to @entity69 's @entity113 , pleaded for international solidarity against the @entity32 rebels			0
" i do n't see any differences " between 9/11 , the @entity232 bombing and the attack on @entity234 , @entity50 said , referring to the 2001 terror attacks on the @entity52 and the bombing of a @entity228 flight over @entity229 in 1988			0
@entity51 called on @entity53 to rein in the rebel fighters , who he said had treated remains poorly and removed evidence from the site			1
" what exactly are they trying to hide ? " he said			0
@entity53 blame @entity6 pro-russian rebels have repeatedly denied responsibility for the shootdown			1
in an interview with @entity244 broadcast monday on @entity69 's " @entity245 , " @entity7 said he believed @entity6 forces either shot the plane down with a surface - to - air missile or , as the @entity53 general suggested , one of its own fighter jets			2
" we did n't have motives and desire to do that , and it is obvious that @entity6 have them , " he said			2
" i ca n't say about desire , but motive is obvious that the crash of this plane was beneficial to them			0
" @entity262 has strongly denied claims it pulled the trigger , and on monday , a @entity53 general suggested that it may instead have been a @entity6 jet fighter that shot the plane down			2
@entity53 monitoring showed a @entity6 su - 25 fighter jet flying along the same route and within 3 kilometers to 5 kilometers ( 1.9 miles to 3.1 miles ) of @entity234 , lt. gen. @entity270 of the @entity53 army general staff said at a news conference , @entity53 state media reported			2
" we would like to know why the @entity6 plane was flying along a civilian route on the same flight path as the @entity3 @entity103 , " @entity270 said , according to the reports			1
in his interview with @entity113 , @entity50 rejected the @entity53 suggestion , saying all @entity6 aircraft were on the ground at the time			2
@entity284 , @entity53 's ambassador to the @entity285 , also blamed @entity6 for the crash on monday			2
but when asked about audio recordings purporting to show @entity32 separatists talking about shooting down a plane , he suggested that if they did , it was an accident			0
" according to them , the people from the east were saying that they shot down a military jet , " he said			0
" if they think they shot down a military jet , it was confusion			0
if it was confusion , it was not an act of terrorism			0
" @entity6 president : the world must choose sides so much we do n't know -- eight unanswered questions who were the victims ? should jet have flown over @entity6 ?			2
