-- it would be dishonest to say that 2014 has been a good year for women			1
we looked in disbelief as a terrorist group in @entity6 and @entity7 turned women into slaves , and another radical group in @entity11 captured hundreds of female students and disappeared with them			1
but 2014 was also a year in which many women fought back and inspired the world with their bravery and savvy			1
they taught us that the stakes are high and the road to a better future is fraught with difficulties , but with strength and dignity , we can get there			0
here are some of the women who in 2014 stared down the odds , helped change history , or changed our perceptions			1
@entity31 and the @entity33 women who fought @entity34 the most enduring and inspiring images of 2014 come from the besieged city of @entity33 , the @entity38 town on @entity6 's border with @entity40 where @entity34 , also known as the @entity41 , met unexpectedly fierce resistance			1
@entity34 militants , who have brutalized girls and women , knew they would face opposition but did not expect @entity33 's defending army to include large numbers of women			1
women make up about one - third of @entity33 's defenders and are part of a dramatic effort by female residents in @entity7 and @entity6 to turn the tide against @entity34 's misogynistic extremists			1
it was @entity31 who captured the world 's attention by telling her fellow members of the @entity7 parliament about the impending genocide of the @entity64			1
there were also women in @entity67 , @entity7 , who gave their lives fighting against @entity34 in other ways			1
their collective message ? they would do everything possible to stop @entity34 from reviving the practice of selling women into slavery			1
@entity76 and @entity77 took on @entity78 international attention on @entity78 -- and panic that it will spread in the @entity81 -- has waned			1
but the battle to stop @entity78 in @entity83 continues , and the front lines are guarded by women , mostly nurses risking their lives to care for the ill. the story of @entity88 's @entity76 , showed the incredible courage and commitment of the task			1
she recalled more than a dozen nurses in her staff already dead , wondering how many more would perish			0
most of those fighting the disease are @entity98 , but @entity100 volunteers have joined , also doing heroic work			0
they included @entity77 , a @entity102 nurse who found herself at the center of a politicized dispute when she returned home			0
@entity77 refused to allow politicians and public health officials give in to public fears			0
by refusing to sit quietly in an airport isolation tent , and later in home quarantine , she forced @entity111 to look more clearly at the risks and helped put an end to the overblown panic			0
@entity115 helped rally the world to # @entity117 when hundreds of @entity11 girls were kidnapped by @entity120 , the @entity121 radical group , @entity11 women needed help to resolve the crisis			1
@entity115 was one of the key figures who helped launch a viral campaign , # @entity117 , that took the @entity127 by storm and got the world 's attention			0
some of the girls managed to escape , and bravely told the horrifying story of their captivity			1
the threat from @entity120 is no longer secret			0
neglect by the central government is harder to conceal , and the search is not over			0
hope for their return is not lost			0
@entity141 won the @entity142 when it comes to defying those who would stop women 's equality , the foremost icon is @entity141 , the @entity148 girl shot in the head by the @entity150 to stop her efforts to help girls attain education			1
@entity141 survived and kept up her mission			1
she and @entity155 , an @entity156 children 's rights advocate , won the @entity157 together			1
she is the youngest person in history to win the award			1
@entity160 , @entity161 and others came out against @entity163 more than a dozen women have come out accusing @entity163 , a beloved television personality , of sexual assault and rape			1
women such as @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity169 , @entity170 and others			2
perhaps what 's most surprising is that these accusations are not new but that the world had not taken them seriously			0
nothing has been proved in a court of law , but the women , whose voices are finally being heard , have created an important zeitgeist moment			2
sexual assault by anyone , even powerful people , is simply not acceptable			0
these women are breaking down the barriers for others to come out and tell their stories			2
@entity188 and fellow space explorers boosted @entity156 when @entity156 scientists and engineers put a rocket into orbit around @entity195 , mission control exploded into cheers			0
among them were scores of women in colorful saris			2
@entity156 's space program is drawing worldwide accolades , and many of the people responsible for its success are @entity156 women			2
@entity208 and @entity209 are changing prime time for decades , women were relegated largely to supporting role on @entity111 television			2
that has changed , with strong women now playing the lead in several prime time shows			2
the small screen is suddenly filled with powerful , multidimensional characters -- women whose lives are not centered on the men in their lives			2
there 's @entity226 , the lead character played by @entity227 in " scandal , " from producer @entity208			0
there 's @entity230 , played by @entity209 in " @entity231 , " from producers @entity232 and @entity234			0
and there 's @entity236 , played by @entity237 , in " madam secretary , " a show created by @entity240			0
the landscape of television is being transformed -- we now have new role models not to mention more interesting programming			0
@entity246 and @entity247 know how to build empires women may have performed for a long time , but the phenomenon of women taking charge of their careers and building empires is newer			2
talented , entrepreneurial women are creating entertainment empires with themselves at the center			2
this year , @entity246 seemed to have been everywhere while her album is the biggest of the year in copies sold			0
meanwhile , @entity247 remains the highest paid actress on tv for a third year in a row			0
they have become powerhouses , expanding their reach and their influence .			0

@entity268 : 2014 is a year in which many women fought back against *injustices*
the women who make up the army defending @entity33 , @entity7 , are brave to take on @entity34
@entity141 , an advocate for girls ' education , became the youngest person to win the @entity142
@entity76 was incredibly courageous to help @entity88 fight @entity78
