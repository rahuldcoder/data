-- we all want to live forever			1
but , chances are , you 'd rather forego a legacy altogether than have your name be synonymous with a goofy flub like a spoonerism or a dim - witted word like " dunce			1
" you can find a saint under tawdry in the dictionary			1
for the following eponyms , we ask : did these word - inspiring folks really deserve their drag through the linguistic mud ? 1			1
dunce dictionaries do n't play fair , and @entity20 is proof			1
the 13th/14th - century thinker , whose writings synthesized @entity25 theology and @entity27 's philosophy , was considerably less dumb than a brick			2
unfortunately for @entity20 , subsequent theologians took a dim view of all those who championed his viewpoint			2
these " @entity34 , " " @entity35 , " or " @entity36 " were considered hairsplitting meatheads and , eventually , just " dunces			2
( slipping a ) @entity38 when you have to drug somebody against their will ( hey , you got ta do what you got ta do ) , it just would n't sound right to slip ' em a @entity44 , a @entity46 , or an @entity47			2
it 's got ta be a @entity38			2
at the turn of the 20th century , @entity49 was a @entity51 saloon owner in one of the seediest parts of town -- and he fit right in			2
@entity49 was known for serving " @entity55 , " which probably included chloral hydrate , a heavy sedative			2
after targeted customers passed out , @entity49 would haul them into his " operating room " and liberate them of all valuables ( including shoes )			2
never a host of the @entity65 candidate , this @entity38 seems to have thoroughly earned his legacy , so do n't hesitate to use it the next time you drug and rob your own customers			2
@entity72 reverend @entity73 ( 1844 -- 1930 ) was famous for his muddled one - liners			0
and though it 's hard to know which ones he actually said , lines such as " i have a half - warmed fish " and " yes indeed , the @entity78 is a shoving leopard " still prove that the sound - switching flub is pretty charming as far as mistakes go			0
the spoonerism has even been used as a literary technique by poets and fiction writers , giving @entity73 little reason to roll over -- or otherwise inarticulately protest -- in his grave			0
@entity88 although several @entity90 ( not including @entity91 ) have been investigated by inquisitive etymologists , @entity89 native @entity88 ( 1736 -- 1796 ) is most likely the man behind the murderous word			0
@entity88 was a patriot , a planter , and a judge			0
but when he headed a vigilante court to punish @entity97 ( @entity99 loyalists ) during the @entity100 , he decided to play the roles of jury and executioner , too			0
@entity88 has more than earned his besmirched name			0
in fact , he did half the besmirching himself by egotistically referring to his actions as " lynch law " and " lynching			0
shrapnel while battling @entity110 's army , @entity112 general @entity111 ( 1761 -- 1842 ) noticed that original - flavor cannonballs just were n't massacring enough enemies for his liking			1
so , to get more shebang for his shilling , he filled the cannonballs with bullets and exploding charges			1
these " shrapnel shells , " or " shrapnel - barrages , " were pretty darn effective , and later designs proved even more successful in @entity123 i. shrapnel did n't get much credit for the " innovation " during his lifetime , but he ultimately contributed to enough death and misery that he pretty much deserves to be synonymous with a violent , metallic byproduct of combat			1
draconian a @entity138 news search shows that folks are still talking about " draconian policies , " " draconian penalties , " and , most frighteningly , " draconian sex rules			1
" though @entity145 lawgiver @entity144 is not entirely confirmed to have existed , if he were real , then around 621 @entity146 , he instituted two time - honored traditions : 1 ) writing laws down and 2 ) making laws that were batcrap - insane they include ascribing the death penalty to such atrocities as being lazy , whizzing in an alley , and stealing an apple			1
apparently , he justified his measures with a sort of non-logic along the lines of , " jaywalkers deserve to die , and i ca n't do anything worse to mass murderers			0
so what 're you gon na do ? " 7			0
boycott in a nutshell ? @entity164 got boycotted			0
@entity164 ( 1832 -- 1897 ) was a retired @entity112 army captain who claimed his unwanted fame in 1880 when the @entity167 decided to punish him for not lowering his rents			0
this then - new strategy , which was a mere paragraph in the @entity172 - novel - size saga of @entity174 land reform , was a kind of systematic shunning in which @entity164 was cut off from servants , supplies , mail , and lifestyle free of death threats			1
he might have been an evil landlord , but if @entity164 could see just how successful his name became , he 'd probably be a very sad , regretful , evil landlord			0
tawdry the story of @entity184 ( also known as @entity184 ) is a classic example of how bad names happen to good people			1
@entity184 was the daughter of the king of @entity189 ( then the @entity191 section of @entity192 ) , who lived a monastery - founding , self - abdicating life			1
but , when she died of the plague in 679 , she was sporting a pretty nasty - looking tumor on her neck , which gossipmongers blamed on her penchant for wearing audacious necklaces in her youth			1
after her death , silk scarves called " @entity184 laces " were sold in her honor at @entity209 's annual @entity208			1
then the @entity99 tendency for dropping letters and syllables took over , and @entity184 became " tawdry			1
" it was a short trip from there to the dictionary , and tawdry has been synonymous with gaudy ever since			1
chauvinism @entity217 was an early 19th -- century @entity219 soldier who was so patriotic and nationalistic , he gave patriotism and nationalism a bad name -- or at least a new name			0
a slave to the cult of @entity110 , @entity217 shed his fair share of blood for the emperor			0
how did @entity110 show his appreciation ? by giving @entity217 a ceremonial saber , a ribbon , and a pittance of a pension			0
later , however , @entity219 dramatists began basing Ã¼ber - patriotic characters on @entity217 , which paved the way for the soldier 's ultimate reward : a dubious spot in the @entity112 language			0
