-- two @entity2 migrants accused of the brutal murder of two @entity5 tourists on a popular tourist island in @entity7 last month have retracted their confessions , a lawyer representing them says			1
@entity10 and @entity11 , who have been in custody since october 1 , had admitted to killing @entity13 and raping and murdering @entity14 on @entity15 , according to @entity7 police			2
however the men now say they did so under duress after being physically abused by police , @entity17 , the head of the @entity18 of @entity7 , which is acting for the two suspects , told @entity0 wednesday			1
@entity17 said the men deny the murder and rape charges , and that an official complaint to the justice department of @entity26 , which has jurisdiction over the island , has been filed			1
they appealed for fair treatment for the two accused , he added			0
@entity7 police could not be immediately reached for a response			2
the two @entity5 were found dead on a beach on the island , a popular tourist destination , on september 15			0
both were partially undressed with severe injuries to their heads			0
a hoe with blood on it was found close by , police said			2
police commissioner gen. @entity41 previously told @entity0 that dna in semen taken from @entity14 matched samples taken from the two men			1
" the dna matching result is out already and they matched with dna found on the female victim , " he said			0
torture claims denied reports that the police extracted confessions through torture first surfaced earlier this month , when @entity2 media reported that its two nationals had complained to a visiting lawyer attached to the @entity2 embassy			1
the revelation prompted national police chief @entity41 to hold a press conference in @entity61 to deny allegations his officers had tortured the suspects			1
nevertheless , @entity65 has called for a full , independent investigation into reports of misconduct by police officers			1
allegations of torture should be investigated independently , and not by the @entity7 police , @entity70 , @entity65 's @entity71 director , told @entity0 earlier this month			1
he also said there were questions of due process that had arisen , specifically the absence of legal counsel prior to the confession , and difficulties with interpretation			0
" there is a fairly long - standing record of ill - treatment , " in @entity7 , he said			0
" impunity is also a problem			0
if the investigation shows ill - treatment , those responsible should pay			2
" the fact that the suspects are migrant workers , many of whom work in @entity7 illegally , makes them more vulnerable , he added			0
journalist @entity95 in @entity61 contributed to this report .			0
