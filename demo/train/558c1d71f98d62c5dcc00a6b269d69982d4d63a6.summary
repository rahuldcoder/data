@entity0 , @entity1 -- the shoe phone on tv 's " @entity5 " was n't just a sneaky spy gadget , it was a technological marvel : a wireless , portable telephone that could be used anywhere -- though it did require a dime to make a call			1
today , almost everyone has a pocket - sized version that also takes photos , shoots video , sends e-mail and surfs the @entity18			1
about the only thing it does n't do is protect your feet			0
" @entity5 " comes to the big screen next week , along with a spate of new spy gadgets to help @entity26 , agent 99 and the other spies at @entity5			1
the gadgets are just as goofy as they were in the original tv series , but because technology has caught up with the writers ' imaginations , there 's a big difference : many of the movie 's doo - dads actually exist			1
" our favorite thing is to take something that does sort of exist and just exaggerate it a little bit , " said @entity39 , who co-wrote the script			0
the film shows a tiny @entity47 alongside spy - worthy stuff such as a two - way tooth radio and a digital " spy fly " -- all of which are available now			1
" it 's pushed to a level of success that perhaps it has n't achieved in the real world , but it 's real , it 's out there , so that 's fun " added co-writer @entity61 , a self - described science nut			1
director @entity63 said he originally could n't believe such devices were real			0
" i said , ` that 's too silly			1
i do n't think people will buy it , " ' he recalled telling the writers			0
" then they googled it and it came up as an actual thing			0
" @entity61 and @entity39 saw the tooth radio in a magazine and thought it was a perfect fit for the film			2
" that 's an example of taking inspiration from the old series in spirit , " @entity61 said			2
" the inherent comedy of having a microphone in your mouth -- it 's really close to your voice and it 's easy to yell and be too loud			2
" the inextricable link between gadgets and spy movies began with @entity91 in 1962 , said tv historian @entity92 , author of " the @entity93 to @entity94 and @entity95			1
" the often - preposterous @entity96 used added levity to a genre that " had always been deadly serious " during the early years of the @entity99 , @entity92 said			2
back in the day , " @entity5 " ratcheted up the goofiness level with bulletproof pajamas , a @entity103 - burner phone and other wacky gadgets that often did n't work			1
when the show debuted in 1965 , the nation was future - focused and obsessed with the promise of technology			1
the show played on that obsession , @entity92 said , introducing dozens of covert gadgets and props designed to make life easier for @entity99 - era secret agents			1
a cigarette lighter doubled as a .22 - caliber gun			2
a lipstick could record conversations or release poisonous gas			0
then there was the famous shoe phone and the always - dysfunctional " cone of silence " that could ( theoretically ) keep conversations private , even in a crowded room			2
" it 's nothing that you would expect to find or would even make sense in real life , and that 's the gag , " @entity92 said			2
" it was part of what the show was about			0
you 'd watch wondering what 's next , where 's the phone going to be next time			0
... it was like a satire of our fixation with gadgets			1
" the movie also takes liberties with some familiar devices , such as portable lasers , retinal scanners and a tricked - out @entity147 equipped with a flame - thrower and a mini crossbow			0
despite living in a high - tech world , movie fans still love spy gadgets , the filmmakers said : just look at the success of the @entity91 franchise , which will soon introduce its 22nd installment , and spy spoofs such as " @entity158			1
" part of it is the undercover element , part of it is a cultural love for technology , and part of it is wishful thinking			0
" human beings are tool - users , " @entity61 said			0
" we would like to believe that our government -- the good guys -- have within their power tools and electronic gadgets that will protect us that are beyond what we could do			0
" " there is some reality to it , " @entity39 said			0
" we do have facial - recognition software , but on the other hand , i 'm not allowed to bring shampoo on an airplane			0
