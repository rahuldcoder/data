@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 mass killer @entity3 should be considered sane and acquitted for the attacks that left 77 people dead , his lawyer said in closing arguments friday			1
@entity3 has admitted carrying out the july 22 attack on a @entity10 youth camp on @entity11 that killed 69 people and a bombing targeting government workers in @entity0 that killed eight			2
but @entity3 , who boasts of being an ultranationalist who killed his victims to fight multiculturalism in @entity1 , says he acted out of " necessity			1
" defense lawyer @entity19 argued that @entity3 should be fully acquitted on the charges of voluntary homicide and committing acts of terror in @entity1 -- and that this should be on the grounds of necessity , not insanity			2
if @entity3 is not acquitted , he should be given the lightest possible sentence , @entity19 said as he wrapped up his closing arguments			2
he asked the judges to discount the claim by prosecutors that @entity3 is mentally ill and should be transferred to a psychiatric institution			1
many friends and relatives of the victims left the courtroom in protest as @entity3 rose to give his own closing argument , the last one heard before the trial concluded			1
he described his actions on july 22 as " barbaric " but said that only two of more than 30 experts who have evaluated him consider him insane			0
some in the courtroom laughed as he made points criticizing @entity1 's multicultural society and moral values			0
the court ruled that his speech could not be broadcast			0
after @entity3 's statement , the judges said the verdict would be delivered august 24			1
prosecutors have asked that @entity3 be acquitted on the grounds of insanity , in which case he would be held in a secure mental health unit			1
if he is fully acquitted on the grounds of " necessity , " as urged by his defense , he could go free			0
if he is ruled sane and found guilty of some or all the charges , he would be sentenced to prison time			0
earlier , applause greeted the accounts of survivors and relatives of those killed when they addressed the court			2
the judges and prosecutors were among those displaying emotion as they listened , with some moved to tears			2
outside the courtroom , one of the survivors of the @entity11 attack , @entity78 , said he was " very relieved this trial has been as dignified , thorough , proper as it has been			1
" seeing the legal system treat it like any other criminal case has been the best show of strength possible , the 24 - year - old said			0
@entity78 , a youth politician in @entity0 , said the case had highlighted the danger of @entity90 in @entity1 society and the need to fight it			0
hearing fellow survivors testify about the attacks on @entity11 had been less difficult than seeing their impact on the relatives of those killed , he said			0
" you meet people who have lost relatives and children , sisters and brothers , and it 's a much more profound bereavement than losing friends , even though i did lose some very good friends and role models , " he said			2
the issue of @entity3 's sanity has been at the heart of the case			1
if he is not found to be mentally ill , prosecutors will ask for a prison sentence of 21 years , a spokeswoman for the prosecutor 's office said			1
giving his closing arguments friday , @entity19 sought to argue that his client 's past did not point to a history of violent acts but rather to political activism			0
" the central criterion for insanity is that the ability of realistic assessment of one 's relationship to the outside world is largely abolished , " he said			0
" is it violent fantasy that is the mother of these actions , or is it his political opinion ? " the lawyer outlined @entity3 's political life and activity as heard by the court , from the early days when he was member of a party to the extreme political arguments he posted online			1
@entity19 also recalled how @entity3 's mother and his friends said he was intense when he talked about politics but never said he was intense about violence			1
he questioned an initial psychiatric report given to the court that said his client had been acting under a delusion , saying @entity3 's radicalization had developed through his engagement with extremist communities online			1
the lawyer cited @entity3 's active stock trading , social life and preparations for the attacks as examples of how he did not meet the criteria to be considered insane			1
under those criteria , he should be disinterested , aimless , inactive , self - centered and socially withdrawn , @entity19 said			0
" that he has been aimless is certainly the last thing i would call this man , " he said			0
@entity19 also argued that @entity3 had chosen his targets politically , noting that he did n't attack nonpolitical people like the captain on the boat to @entity11 and the youngest children on the island			2
" @entity3 knew that killing was wrong , but it 's what any classic terrorist does , " he said			1
the lawyer told the court he shared the prosecutor 's view that the attacks , which he called " a cruel act of terrorism , " were almost too horrible to be true			2
but , he said , the key question for his client was whether he acted under the legal principle of " necessity			0
" @entity19 has previously said it is important to @entity3 that people see him as sane so they do n't dismiss his views			2
last month , @entity3 promised that he would not appeal if a court finds him sane and guilty			1
@entity187 , a survivor of the @entity11 attack , said it is down to the court to deliver a " good and fair judgment " on @entity3 , in accordance with @entity1 's longstanding principles of justice			1
its ruling on whether he is sane matters less than the fact that @entity3 's extremist views are shared by other people , he said			1
however , listening to @entity3 in court had made him appear as less of a " scary monster , " @entity187 said			1
" now it 's just a pathetic man sitting there			0
" asked what his personal message to the court would be , he said , " i am still alive			0
i 'm a survivor , not a victim , and i will live on and fight on to work against future extremist acts			0
" the issues thrown up by @entity3 's trial have led the @entity1 authorities to re-evaluate the country 's provision for holding dangerous criminals who are found to be insane			1
the government proposed amendments to the @entity219 in may , aiming " to strengthen the security measures relating to a small group of particularly dangerous patients			0
" the current law allows " too great a risk for escape , hostage - taking and severe violence against patients and staff " in the health institutions where such patients are currently housed , a statement from the @entity224 said			0
the new legislation would strengthen security measures and allow for a high - security unit to be based within a prison , opening the possibility that @entity3 could be held in a secure unit in the same @entity240 where he has been detained for almost a year			2
the amendments will come into force july 1			0
in the course of the trial , which started in mid-april , the court has heard grueling testimony from the survivors of the july 22 attacks			0
survivors and relatives of those killed and injured have also been present in the courtroom to hear @entity3 give his account of the events of that day and the motivation for his acts			1
in his testimony early in the trial , @entity3 claimed to represent a " @entity258 resistance movement " and " @entity258 who do n't want our ethnic rights to be taken away			1
" the shocking attacks prompted @entity1 to reassert their commitment to multiculturalism and tolerance at a series of mass public tributes			0
@entity2 's @entity268 and @entity269 , and journalist @entity270 ¦ ter in @entity0 contributed to this report .			0

the trial ends , and judges say the verdict will be delivered on august 24
a survivor says he is relieved @entity3 's trial has been " dignified , thorough , proper "
as @entity3 addresses the court , relatives of some of the 77 victims walk out in protest
