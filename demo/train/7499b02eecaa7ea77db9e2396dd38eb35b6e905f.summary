@entity0 will never forget the moment when his father laid on the ground and prayed			1
@entity4 had been shot five times while wresting a gunman in a @entity8 temple in @entity9 , @entity10			1
his turban was knocked off , and two kids and a priest crawled up beside him			2
@entity0 went to the temple and stared at that spot			1
his father did not survive			1
he died along with five others			2
" it felt like he was praying and putting something into the zeitgeist and imprinting it , " he told @entity17			1
his son hoped it would lead to a changing tide on gun violence			1
interactive : faces of the gun debate as he began his meditation that day , @entity0 made a vow : he would do whatever he could to ensure nobody ever went through what his family had			1
" it just came over me that you ca n't stay silent , " he said			2
" you ca n't continue to allow violence like this to happen haphazardly at a church , at a school , any place			2
four months later , 20 children and six adults were gunned down in @entity44 , @entity45			2
that school massacre has led many people , including @entity0 , 33 , to question where we go from here as a country			1
or if we will ever get there at all			2
it led him to stand up at a gathering here on thursday , @entity17 's " @entity57 : an @entity58 , " and ask a panel of advocates with polar opposite views if they could agree on anything			1
if there was actually any middle ground			1
" after meeting with so many senators , so many gun proponents and gun control advocates , it seems like they 're recycling the same jargon all the time , " he said , explaining his reason for the question			2
" so i was just hoping , let 's get to the common ground			1
" the panel included @entity77 board members , the president of the @entity79 to @entity80 , law enforcement representatives and other participants voicing viewpoints across the spectrum			2
was there a consensus ? sort of			2
" there 's a lot of common ground , " @entity87 , a member of the @entity77 board of directors and a former president of the group , said at the town hall			1
" we do n't want people who are insane to have guns , we do n't want terrorists to have guns			1
part of this national dialogue is coming together			2
" so everyone agreed : something has to happen			2
the devil is in the details			2
" i think the common ground clearly exists from a policy standpoint when talking about background checks , " said @entity106 , president of the @entity79 to @entity80			1
but it is n't that simple			2
it never is when it comes to gun control			0
" the @entity77 is not against background checks , " @entity87 said			0
" we support making sure they are enforced			0
we 're not supporting more background checks of law - abiding citizens			0
" her remarks signaled a slight change in the @entity77 's stance			1
in a heated back and forth , the two debated whether it was truly harmful to force everyone who wants to purchase a gun -- whether at a gun store , a gun show , or in a private sale -- to go through a background check			0
@entity87 talked about how the current background check system was broken , noting that an " instant check " in @entity134 can actually take about 10 days			0
" we have to get it working before we add any more checks , " she said , noting that requiring everyone to undergo a check would take a lot of resources and money			0
@entity143 police commissioner @entity142 spoke from his experience , saying whatever it took , whatever the price tag , it would be worth it to stem the violence			0
" please , do n't worry about the cost			0
i 'll spend the money , " he said , a line that drew massive applause from the crowd at @entity157			0
" it 's a much greater cost than human lives			1
we have to do something			0
the status quo is not acceptable			0
" when @entity0 , the son of one of the @entity8 shooting victims , rose to ask his question about finding a middle ground , he was n't just talking about policy			1
he also meant in our collective way of thinking			0
a filmmaker , @entity0 has made a documentary about violence in @entity174			1
there are too many facets to the problem , he says			0
" it 's a culture of violence			1
and that has to do with guns , that has to do with mental illness , it has to do with stigmatizing people , it has to do with the media , everything about our culture			1
" many appeared to think he was right			1
" everybody 's got to step up on this , " @entity142 said			1
" that 's prosecutors , the courts , everyone			1
if we 're serious about this it ca n't just be a series of laws that are passed			0
" much of the discussion inside the town hall went beyond politics and legislation			0
one heated debate focused on whether armed guards should be posted at schools			0
that 's a proposal that 's been discussed by former congressman @entity210			1
" what is more important than the education and the safety of those children ? " he asked , noting that if malls have armed security , so should schools			0
" i believe an armed security presence is very important			0
" it 's an idea that @entity221 thinks about			1
her son @entity222 was killed in the shooting at @entity224 in @entity44			1
" i think there might be a certain power in deterrence , " she said			0
" in the case of @entity44 , it 's clear that the perpetrator did choose the path of least resistance , the most vulnerable defenseless victims			1
he did n't head for the high school where he could have been tackled			0
" while she said she was n't sure an armed guard would have saved her son , she did say it made her feel more comfortable dropping off her other children at the new school for @entity242 children , a building that does have armed guards			0
@entity245 , who survived the @entity247 shooting , said he understood the desire to protect children , but he did n't understand why arming guards is the go - to solution			1
" i just do n't understand why the first idea put forth is something that might help at the last second , " he said , to massive applause from the audience			0
" we can do things in advance to keep a dangerous person and a gun from coming together in the first place			0
" that 's the conversation that usually leads to a debate about mental health			1
it is an area president @entity266 has pledged resources to ; he and many others hope to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill. the difficulty comes in figuring out who poses a threat			1
" we look at behavior and what 's going on in the person 's life , the social dynamics and what are the personality issues that make that person think acting out dangerously is a way to handle their problems , " said @entity274 , a former @entity275 special agent and criminal profiler			1
@entity87 , the @entity77 board member , said she 'd like to see more sharing of resources to ensure a database of the mentally ill would prevent them from having access to guns			2
but @entity294 , whose blog post " i am @entity297 's @entity296 " went viral after the @entity44 shooting , said perhaps we were thinking about this all wrong			1
what if was n't just about identifying threats , but actually making a change			0
" we spend a lot of time talking about keeping guns out of the wrong hands , " she said			2
" what if we could put those resources to making people less dangerous			0
" for @entity0 , at the end of the day , progress on enforcing background checks would be a step in the right direction			1
he recognizes that no solution will make everyone happy			0
but he wishes every advocate , no matter their point of view , would think about the issue as if they were in his shoes			2
" when you are a survivor or a victim or someone close to you dies , it 's everyday you think about it , " he said			2
" @entity329 advocates or scholars or people making money about it , they probably think about it 10 % of how much we think about it			0
we go to the bathroom and think about it			0
we take a cold shower one day , and we start to cry			0
we wake up in the middle of the night with night sweats , and we have to live with it			2
every breath is taken with some thought of violence and safety			0
" he thinks it is time the country does the same : that its citizens think about the issue with every breath			1
" i can never go another moment in my life without thinking about it			0
my wife , my brother , my mother , the people of @entity44 , they will not go a moment for the rest of their life without thinking about it , " he said			0
" personally i think the tide is changing , the zeitgeist is moving towards justice			1
hopefully , once we stop the fear mongering on both sides we can finally get to the point of what makes sense			0
" his greatest hope : that the will to do something about the violence does not die along with those who never had to			0
