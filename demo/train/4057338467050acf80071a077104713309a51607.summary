-- " my thighs cramping up on the very first day ... the mental trauma ... physical adversity ... i felt a great deal of fear wondering how i would make it through the next month , " says @entity5			1
the 30 - year - old @entity10 businessman and former @entity11 is describing his 28 - day run across @entity13 in 2012 , dragging a 190 - pound sled			2
" waking up , swallowing down the most disgusting freeze - dried food , packing up our tents and skiing for up to 12 hours a day in temperatures so cold that on some days my entire beard would be covered in ice			0
" this was my life for one month , except for the five days we were stuck in storms so powerful , the inside of our tent sounded like a washing machine			0
" @entity5 finally completed the journey 20 pounds lighter in bodyweight , with mild frostbite on his fingertips , a swollen ankle and a sunburned nose			1
and he 's going to do it all again , about 190 times			2
his mission is to run across every country in the world in the next 20 - 25 years			1
there is no globally accepted definition for the number of countries in the world			1
the @entity43 puts the figure at 193 and the @entity45 puts it at 195			0
but that 's a lot of running , whichever authority you listen to			2
it 's the first time this specific feat has been attempted , though other similar attempts have been recorded , and this former @entity11 is doing it in reaction to a @entity55 ( @entity55 ) diagnosis he received after returning from a seven - month deployment in @entity58			0
" when i returned home from @entity58 , the @entity59 ( @entity59 ) diagnosed me with @entity55 , " @entity5 tells @entity2			2
" i see now that it is not ptsd but post traumatic growth that has led to my decision to run across the world , because i choose to do something that inspires me to wake up every morning in order to make my life and the world better			2
" making history @entity71 became the fastest person to run a loop around the globe -- more than 20 countries -- from 2011 to 2013			1
@entity77 " the runningman " @entity76 trekked across 30 countries in five years during the late 1990s			2
( editor 's note : an earlier version of this story included information about @entity76 's run that has since been removed			1
) starting with four crossings covering 125 miles ( 201 kilometers ) , around the @entity88 islands -- @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 -- in june 2014 , @entity5 aims to complete 20 countries by may 2015			1
the runner 's troubled history " i began running at the age of 18 after recovering from a life of drugs that killed two of my friends , " he says			0
" running and physical fitness became my way out of that life and into the @entity11			0
" it replaced the high i got from drugs			0
" the adrenaline junkie then discovered skydiving , mountain biking , scuba diving , rock climbing , ice climbing ; " anything that forced me to face my fears , " he says on his website			0
then came the @entity11 , @entity116 and the ptsd diagnosis			0
if the runs themselves do n't sound tough enough , @entity5 also plans to do it all while still running his current business , @entity121 , which aims to help people achieve their potential			1
that business will help with the funding of the trips , and he has some small sponsorships too , from running shoe manufacturers			0
the most challenging trip will be one crossing @entity131 and @entity132 , a 550 - mile ( 885 - kilometer ) run planned for december 2014			1
" running allows me to experience the spectrum of the human condition : ultimate bliss , extreme suffering , complete stillness where there is no past and future and everything in between			0
" in one run , i get to experience an entire human life			0
" his most hotly anticipated run will be across @entity145 , currently planned for august 2014			1
" i wrote my history thesis about the genocide and am very fascinated by the resilience of humanity displayed by the people in [ @entity145 ] , " says @entity5			1
" not only will that trip involve the run across @entity145 , it will involve working with genocide survivors as well -- the overall mission of this project is about connecting with humanity			1
" pain , fear and extra shoes his mission will depend on meticulous planning and a willingness to embrace fear , he says			1
" every time i look at my itinerary and realize how much work i have to do , not just in terms of training , but also in terms of logistical planning , it terrifies me , " says @entity5			1
he replace shoes every 350 miles ( 560 kilometers ) , requiring at least two pairs on each run			2
" i have to not only plan for my next few runs , but plan for the ones after that as well to ensure success			0
" on a 50 - kilometer ( 31 - mile ) run last weekend , i went through many moments where i asked myself , ' do i really want to do this for the rest of my life ? ' " " but as soon as i got back home , i found a 50 - miler ( 80 - kilometer run ) that i want to run next because , despite the pain , there is nothing like that feeling of reward that comes with accomplishing something that pushed your mind , body and spirit to its limits			0
