@entity0 -- more than 30 years after six - year - old @entity2 disappeared in @entity0 on his way to the bus stop , police and federal authorities were tearing apart a @entity9 basement thursday in search of clues as to what happened to the boy who became the face of missing children in @entity16			1
@entity2 disappeared may 25 , 1979 , a block from his home in the city 's @entity21 neighborhood			1
it was the first time he walked to the bus stop by himself			1
authorities said both new and old information led them to a carpenter and part - time handyman who met @entity30 the day before he disappeared and gave the boy a dollar			1
it was interest in the carpenter that prompted authorities to bring a cadaver dog to a @entity21 basement , where @entity30 apparently encountered the 42 - year - old carpenter , according to a source with knowledge of the investigation			1
the dogs picked up the scent of human remains , the source said			1
late thursday , authorities set up a grid in the basement and were using jackhammers to rip up the concrete floor			1
they also took out part of the back wall of the basement , an unoccupied area beneath what was once a restaurant			1
" we 're looking for human remains , clothing or other personal effects of @entity2 , " @entity61 spokesman @entity60 said of the current investigation			1
" it 's a very painstaking process			2
" in 2010 , manhattan district attorney @entity68 said his office decided to take another look at the decades - old mystery			1
@entity74 leads were then culled from that case file , sources said			1
the investigation , which has often been described as a milestone case that helped draw the plight of missing children into the national consciousness , garnered headlines as authorities splashed the child 's image on the sides of milk cartons in the hopes of gathering more information			1
it 's thought to be the first time that step was taken for a missing child			2
@entity30 was officially declared dead in 2001 as part of a civil lawsuit filed by his family against a drifter , @entity96 , a convicted child molester acquainted with @entity30 's babysitter			0
a judge found @entity100 responsible for the death and ordered him to pay the family $ 2 million			0
he never paid the money			0
though @entity96 has been considered a key focus of the probe for years , he has never been charged in the case			0
he is serving a 20 - year sentence in a @entity109 prison for molesting another boy and is set to be released later this year			1
a source said investigators now also want to expand the pool of possible suspects beyond @entity96			0
the carpenter , now 75 , is not in custody , though authorities say they know where he is and are currently in contact with him			1
@entity1 is not naming the man because he has not been charged with a crime			0
dozens of police and federal agents gathered outside the building on @entity9 's @entity127 on thursday and are expected to continue their search over the next five days			2
@entity74 special agent @entity129 said the bureau 's @entity130 is at the scene			0
" we are cautiously optimistic " that the search will be helpful , " @entity74 special agent @entity133 told @entity1			0
forensic evidence uncovered at the scene will be analyzed at the @entity74 laboratory in @entity139 , @entity140 , the sources said			2
it is not clear whether authorities searched the basement in 1979 , though a source said it " figured into " the investigation			1
authorities have reason to think the new search could lead to the discovery of the boy 's remains at that location , though they remain wary after past leads in the case failed to pan out , according to two sources familiar with the probe			1
" i hope they find something , " said resident @entity158 , who says he 's lived in the neighborhood since 1976			0
@entity21 , a lower @entity9 neighborhood now known for its boutique shops , art galleries and loft apartments , at the time was considered a grittier locale , where abandoned storefronts dotted the city streets			0
@entity158 said he remembers the initial investigation into @entity30 's disappearance when police first knocked on his door in search of clues			0
" that 's odd , is n't it , " he said , referring to the fact that 33 years later , police are again in his neighborhood searching for the boy			2
on the day of his disappearance , @entity30 's mother , @entity180 , learned after her son failed to return home from school that he had n't been in classes that day			2
she called the school , then called the homes of all his friends			0
when she found no one who had seen her son , she called police and filed a missing person report			0
by evening , more than 100 police officers and searchers had gathered with bloodhounds			0
the search continued for weeks , but no clues to @entity30 's whereabouts were found			0
the boy 's disappearance was thought to raise awareness of child abductions and led to new ways to search for missing children			2
president @entity204 named may 25 , the day @entity30 went missing , @entity205			2
@entity1 's @entity206 contributed to this report .			0
