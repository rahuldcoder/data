@entity0 -- @entity2 wants a key piece of evidence tested which his lawyers argue could prove @entity6 injected himself with the drug that killed him			1
@entity2 , who is serving a four - year prison sentence , is appealing last year 's involuntary manslaughter conviction in @entity6 's 2009 death			1
a motion filed monday by his lawyers asked an appeals court to order a test of the residue in a 100 milliliter bottle of propofol that prosecutors say contained the fatal dose of surgical anesthetic			1
@entity2 invites @entity20 to visit him in jail if it contains 10 % lidocaine , then it would support prosecution expert dr. @entity25 's theory that @entity2 rigged up an iv drip using the bottle and then left the room , @entity2 's motion said			2
@entity25 testified that lidocaine , which was found in @entity6 's blood after his death , was mixed with propofol to ease the sting of the drug as it entered a vein in @entity6 's leg			2
" however , if the residue is 100 % propofol , it would absolutely refute @entity25 's final contention that was used to prove an iv propofol infusion , " the motion said			0
the defense theory was that a desperate @entity6 , fearing that his comeback concerts could be canceled unless he found elusive sleep , self - administered propofol that @entity2 was trying to wean him off of			1
it contends that @entity6 also swallowed eight lorazepam tablets while @entity2 was not watching			2
two requests by @entity2 's lawyers to have the bottle tested after the trial were rejected by the trial judge , who ruled they should have asked for testing before the trial			0
@entity2 's lawyers argued the residue in the bottle , which the prosecution never tested , became relevant only at the end of the prosecution 's case " when @entity25 " remodeled " his theory about how @entity6 died			1
" dr. @entity25 made a striking change in his rebuttal testimony , which occurred during the final minutes of the evidentiary portion of the trial , " @entity2 lawyer @entity63 said			0
@entity2 told police he stopped using iv infusions of propofol to help @entity6 sleep three days before his death , and that he only injected a small dose the morning he died			1
" the amount of propofol @entity2 claims he gave @entity77 does in fact comport with the amount of propofol found in @entity6 's blood at autopsy , " @entity2 lawyer @entity74 said			2
" there was no propofol infusion on the morning of @entity6 's death			0
the analysis of the residue in @entity88 will prove the truth once and for all			0
