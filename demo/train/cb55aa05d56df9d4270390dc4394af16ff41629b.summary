nuclear fears @entity24 : no deal ! that 's what @entity5 seems to be saying about sending some of its nuclear materials to other countries			1
this plan was worked out at a meeting last month			0
@entity5 would send raw nuclear materials to other nations who would make it into nuclear fuel , and then that would go back to @entity5 to be used in medical facilities			0
but now , instead of sending out materials and getting them back later as fuel , one @entity5 official is saying the country will only swap raw materials for already processed fuel , and the trade would have to happen in @entity5			0

@entity111 , @entity27 attorney general : it was a decision that was case - driven			1
it 's a decision based on the evidence that i know , that frankly , some of the people who have criticized the decision do not have access to			1
@entity127 : @entity35 members of the @entity143 led the intense criticism of @entity111 's decision			1
@entity146 , ( r ) @entity147 : how could you be more likely to get a conviction in federal court when @entity131 has already asked to plead guilty before a military commission and be executed ? @entity127 : but @entity152 who support the move expressed confidence in the court system and the ability of the city of @entity104 to handle the trials , even though it was the epicenter of the 9/11 attacks			1
sen. @entity162 , ( @entity163 ) @entity164 : i happen to believe that @entity104 is able to handle this in a very professional and definitively legal manner			0
@entity127 : and @entity111 said it in no way undermines the administration 's commitment to fighting terror			1

for @entity0 , i 'm @entity114			0
( @entity188 ) @entity189 @entity190 , @entity14 : today 's shoutout goes out to mr. @entity193 's social studies classes at @entity194 in @entity195 , @entity147 ! who is the longest - serving member in the history of the @entity110 ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a ) @entity205 , b ) @entity207 , c ) @entity29 or @entity163 ) @entity204 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! today is senator @entity205 's 20,775th day serving in @entity110			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! congressional history @entity24 : six years in the @entity213 ; elected to the @entity23 nine terms -- only person ever to do that -- it makes sen. @entity205 's total time representing residents of @entity220 51 years so far			1
plus , he 's turning 92 tomorrow			1
as he became the longest - serving member of @entity110 yesterday , @entity205 's years of service were praised by @entity152 and @entity35			1
senate minority leader @entity223 talked about sen. @entity205 's love for both the country and the @entity110			1
and senate majority leader @entity29 predicted that many of @entity205 's records will never be broken			1
@entity228 @entity24 : deja vu in waters off the coast of the @entity233 nation of @entity234 , when pirates tried to hijack a ship called the @entity237			0
if that sounds familiar to you , it 's because that was the same ship that was hijacked back in april			1
a @entity243 operation rescued the crew members in that incident			0
and yesterday , a private security team on board the @entity246 kept the attempted hijackers from taking over			0
when we talk about pirates , we do n't mean " of the @entity252			0
" these are very dangerous people with guns ; they hold ships for ransom ; they 're very active in this part of the world			0
is this legit ? @entity259 , @entity14 : is this legit ? the @entity233 elephant is the largest animal on land			0
these animals can grow to be 9 tons ; that 's 18,000 pounds ! @entity266 @entity24 : okay -- that 's the full - grown version , but even the babies are huge ! african elephants can still weigh around 220 pounds at birth ! but big does n't necessarily mean safe			1
they 're losing their habitat ; they 're being hunted by poachers : baby elephants can face a lot of threats in the wild , and not having a mother around does n't make it any easier			1
@entity282 examines a program in @entity6 that 's trying to help orphaned elephants			1
( begin video ) @entity286 , @entity0 correspondent : they grow up to be one of @entity290 's giants , but like all creatures , they start off pretty small			1
dwarfed by their keepers , each orphaned elephant at the @entity293 has a tragic tale			2
she 's 6 weeks old			2
they say her mother died because of starvation in the @entity6 drought			1
the person who found her gave her cow 's milk , which is extremely harmful to elephants because of the fat			1
@entity298 wandered into a tourist camp in @entity6 's @entity310 , alone and confused			1
the orphanage scrambled a plane to rescue her			0
carefully strapped in and traumatized , they evacuated @entity298 to @entity314			0
for weeks , she was too sick to stand			0
three days ago , she started walking again			0
if she makes it , she wo n't be alone			0
drought , poaching and shrinking habitats have decimated elephant herds across @entity290			0
and the orphanage is fuller than it 's been in 30 years			2
still , @entity322 will take more			0
@entity322 , @entity293 : whatever comes in , we have to make space			0
@entity325 : it takes years to rehabilitate and reintroduce the orphans into the wild			0
for the keepers , it 's not just a 9 to 5 job			2
@entity332 , chief keeper : but after working with these elephants , it 's no longer just a job			1
it is from inside your heart , the love that you have for these animals			0
@entity325 : every three hours , day and night , the keepers mix fortified soy milk for the elephants			2
it costs $ 900 a month to care for each orphan , so the elephants have to earn their keep			2
with a slap of sunscreen to protect their sensitive skin , the babies go on parade			0
they slush and slide for the throngs of tourists who see the fun , but not the heartbreak			0
@entity325 : so , they hope to lead these infants through their most fragile stage			0
it could take years before @entity298 joins a family of wild elephants			2
in the care of her human family , she might just make it			0
@entity282 , @entity0 , @entity314 , @entity6			1
( @entity188 ) impact your world @entity24 : helping elephant orphans , providing aid to victims of natural disasters , finding ways to clean up the environment : there are a lot of ways to impact your world			0
@entity379 to @entity380 / impact and check out the resources to find out how you can make a difference			0
before we go @entity24 : before we go , it 's crazy what you 'll find on the side of the road			2
like a turkey , for example			0
actually , this fearless fowl 's walking right through the middle of traffic on the @entity396			2
highway workers say @entity398 -- tammy the @entity399 -- has been hanging out for about a year			0
why did the turkey cross the turnpike ? who knows -- it 's a turkey			2
but she does get a lot of looks from people driving by , and she seems to enjoy it ! goodbye @entity24 : in fact , you could say @entity398 's gobbling up all the attention			2
that 's where today 's show hits the road			1
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity22 .			0
