-- do you ever look at your smartphone and think it 's just too stiff and flat ? a growing number of tech giants have , and they 're aiming to fix that with what may become the next wave of smartphone innovation			2
@entity11 announced on monday that it will start mass - producing a flexible , curved smartphone screen			1
its first devices to use the new 6 - inch @entity15 screens will be available next year			1
several companies have shown prototypes of flexible displays before , but so far there have n't been any mass - market bendy phones			1
@entity21 announced a similar screen technology last month and plans to release the 5.7 - inch @entity23 , its first device with a curved display , later in october			1
@entity25 has long been rumored to be looking into similar technology for the @entity27			1
a patent filed in march describes an " electronic device with wrap around display " that would go around most , or all , of the device			0
@entity25 , like other companies , sometimes files patents for products that never come to market			0
what 's clear in the minds of many is that the coming wave of flexible and curved displays is just the first step in what could become a dramatic shift in what we expect of our phones			2
" what we 're seeing today is a big step toward a break from the rectangular norm of smartphone design , paving the way for more outlandish shapes and sizes for future devices , " @entity48 , of tech blog @entity50 , wrote monday			2
since @entity25 released the keyboard - killing @entity27 , the physical design of smartphones has pretty much stagnated			2
the touchscreen rectangles have appeared in different sizes , and recently companies like @entity66 and @entity25 have tried to spice things up with different colors and patterns on the back			2
but the basic look is the same			0
most of the serious competition takes place inside the devices			0
manufacturers compete for the best camera , the fastest processor , the widest selection of apps and , of course , low price tags			0
when all those specs are close and the devices start to blend together , companies turn to splashier -- some might say gimmicky -- features to try to make their 5 - inch @entity88 smartphones stand out from the other guy 's 5 - inch @entity88 smartphones			1
the @entity91 has a motion - controlled scrolling feature to make it easier to read text without tiring your fingers			0
@entity25 recently added a fingerprint sensor that makes it faster to unlock your phone			0
some companies are trying to change how you interact with your phone , such as @entity25 and @entity103 , which are pushing voice - activated interfaces like @entity105 and @entity106			0
and now there are curved displays			0
@entity11 says its technology works because the panels are built not on glass , but on plastic substrates			1
also called wafers , substrates are thin slices of material that act as semiconductors			0
the new @entity11 display will curve in from top to bottom			2
so , other than the " gee whiz " factor , what are the advantages of a curved or flexible screen for smartphone owners ? to start , a flexible display is thinner and lighter than a glass display			1
in a field where companies ( @entity25 chief among them ) brag about being a fraction of an inch or a few millimeters thinner than the competition , that 's apparently an issue			0
@entity11 and others also market the screens as unbreakable			1
it 's not entirely clear what the practical benefits are of a curved , concave 6 - inch screen , beyond the novelty of having a curved screen			1
@entity21 has said that a curved screen would have more viewing space in the same footprint			1
there are already curved tvs on the market that use similar technology			1
they take advantage of the flexible oled displays and offer a screen that curves in towards the viewer on the left and right sides , supposedly for a more immersive visual experience			2
the effect wo n't work the same way on a small 6 - inch screen , though			1
the tv panels are stuck in their curved position permanently and can not actually be re-bent , so the flexibility is gone			0
the other big mobile trend that has been bubbling up over the past year is wearable peripheral devices that connect to your smartphone , like smart glasses and watches			0
if @entity11 or @entity21 gets the flexible display technology right , it could prove extremely useful in the new wave of small screens that the tech industry is betting we 'll wear on our bodies in the coming years			1
the bulky and poorly received @entity179 , for example , could greatly benefit from a screen that molds to your wrist instead of the giant solid square it sports now			0
@entity0 's @entity184 contributed to this report .			0

@entity11 is working on a flexible , curved screen for 6 - inch smartphones
@entity21 recently announced a similar technology
the *durable* , bent screens could be the next smartphone *fad* and even appear on *smartwatches*
