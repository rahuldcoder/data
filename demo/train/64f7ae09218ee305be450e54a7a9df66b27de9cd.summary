-- before heading to @entity3 in @entity4 last weekend , the cast members of " @entity2 " were each given a folder with talking points about the upcoming fourth season			1
the folders contained information on what the actors could and could n't say about the new episodes , which premieres october 13 on @entity13			0
although none of the actors could reveal the contents of the folders , it was clear that there are lots of secrets to be kept about where " @entity2 " will be headed when it returns			1
last season raised the stakes for the already tumultuous show by introducing a human threat to the zombie - infested world			1
much of the season , which -- spoiler alert -- left several main characters dead , centered on the conflict between a man called the governor ( @entity36 ) and the group led by protagonist @entity38 ( @entity39 )			1
as @entity41 came to a close , the governor had vanished , and his community of @entity44 had joined @entity38 ' group in a prison			0
@entity47 ( @entity48 ) had witnessed the death of her friend @entity50 while couple @entity51 ( @entity52 ) and @entity53 ( @entity54 ) celebrated a very unconventional engagement			0
season 4 will air its 16 episodes in two parts , with the first eight kicking off october 13 and the subsequent episodes premiering in february			1
for the most part , the new season will bring fans right back into the action of last season			1
" there is a little bit of a time jump , but we certainly pick up where we left off , " executive producer and special effects make - up supervisor @entity64 said			1
" the prison has changed a bit , and @entity38 has changed his position in the group			0
we do n't really want to give it away just yet			0
" @entity64 confirmed that a new threat will present itself to the humans this season , and it 's something that can not be killed			1
that threat will be apparent by the end of the season premiere and will launch a narrative arc that he said will keep the jeopardy level high for all the episode			1
@entity64 said he and showrunner @entity87 made the decision that they wanted the threat to be " ever - constant and ever - present " in the new season			1
" so we 've devised ways to put our characters in instantaneous jeopardy , " @entity64 said			0
" that is something that was really important to us , because that is the world we live in , which is that danger could come out of anything			0
it was really important that we re-establish the rules of our world			0
" @entity87 , who has written for the series for three seasons and replaced @entity104 as showrunner for season 4 , said he sees this season as a " greatest hits " of the show			1
" @entity2 " is based on a comic book series by @entity111 , and although it has stayed largely true to its source material in past seasons , @entity87 confirmed that @entity106 will exist in its own frame			1
" it 's remixing different elements from the book in different contexts , " @entity87 said			1
" taking the emotional thrusts of those elements and giving them a different rhythm			0
people will see stuff from the book , and they 'll know exactly where it came from , but it will be in a very different context			0
" it 's a very creative , exciting thing to be doing , " he added			1
" and you 'll see stories that are totally outside the comic that you 've never seen before			0
but the basis of those stories is the from the spirit of the stories in the comic			0
" the characters find themselves part of a new , larger community this season in the prison , and their roles have changed			1
@entity39 , whose character @entity38 has largely been the central point of the show , said there will be a shift in leadership as the story unfolds			0
this is particularly significant as @entity38 's wife , @entity153 , was one of last season 's casualties , leaving @entity38 as the sole parent of their two children			1
" he 's a man that is wrestling with a modus operandi that did n't work last season , " @entity39 said			1
" the brutality that 's always going to be in him , he 's trying to suppress for the sake of both of his children			1
he 's trying to parent in an apocalypse , ( and ) he 's trying to return to the man he once was for the sake of his children			1
" @entity39 said it 's not been easy for his character to balance leading the survivors and being a dad			1
" he 's realized that the distraction and the pressure of leadership drew him away from his responsibilities as a parent , " the actor said			1
" he focuses his energies into something completely different but still helping the people of the community , and i ca n't tell you what that is yet			0
" for @entity52 and @entity54 , this season gives their characters an opportunity to explore having a relationship in a ( sort of ) normal situation -- at least initially			1
@entity52 said there will be " some semblance of a community and a life			0
" " there 's some kids ; i think we can say that			2
and there 's some stability , " she said			2
" there 's hope beyond just them being in love now			2
as important as that was there 's hope of ' could this be ok ? are we starting again ? ' what happens next is anybody 's business			2
" " you find these little moments to really enjoy life , " @entity54 added			0
" that 's going to be the beauty of this season			1
there 's a scope , and there 's a diving into the world of the characters and getting to know the characters we have n't traditionally gotten to know			2
seeing what they 're about and seeing how they choose to live and seeing what decisions they make going forward in a horrible time			0
i think those little moments are going to be the key to balancing out this chaos			0
" as for the governor , his whereabouts remain a mystery			0
@entity36 said the character has gone through some changes , however , as the events of last season weigh heavily upon him			2
" from an emotional point of view , i think it 's much more about what this man is carrying inside him , really , and it 's about how he deals and comes to terms with the man he is , " @entity36 said			2
" and what he 's capable of			2
and which side he 's going to fall on			2
that 's the choice he has to make			2
what the writers have done for the governor in this season is just wonderful			2
" a key question is whether @entity47 will succeed in her desire to exact revenge on the governor for @entity50 's death			2
" @entity47 as a character is very invested in what happened with @entity50 and i think more than any other character is driven to find the governor , figure out what 's going on with him , figure out where he is , what he may be plotting and trying to do , " executive producer @entity111 said			2
" and bringing him to justice			0
that 's something her character is dealing with very early on			0
i ca n't say anything more than that			0
" what the writers and actors could say is that creating " @entity2 " is a highly collaborative and enjoyable process			1
although there is always the lingering fear that a beloved character will be killed off ( the producers have said that no one is safe ) , the cast is deeply invested in making this the best show possible			0
" we all respect the fact that we 're only as good as each other , " @entity36 said			0
" we 've got to look after each other			0

" @entity2 " was well - represented at this year 's @entity3
one of the producers said there will be a new threat this season
there will also be a blossoming relationship
