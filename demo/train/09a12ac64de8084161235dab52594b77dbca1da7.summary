-- here we go again			0
@entity2 is upon us , and that means some people are getting sensitive about holiday greetings			1
in modern - day @entity7 , however , residents are now statutorily permitted to use the greeting of their choice without fear of legal reprisal : " @entity2 , " " @entity13 " or " happy holidays "			1
state rep. @entity15 helped last year to pass what is now known as the @entity2 law			1
he and the @entity18 wanted to ensure students could exchange traditional holiday greetings and display @entity2 trees , menorahs and @entity24 scenes at school , as long as more than one religion and a secular symbol are included			1
constitutionally , this protective legislation is not really required , and teachers can wish holiday greetings without fear of liability			0
on the other hand , this law may allay any fears state employees have about exercising their rights to merrymake on government property			1
it feels like this sort of thing did n't happen 30 years ago			2
when i was a kid , holiday greetings were the least of our worries			0
as kids , my brothers and i had other worries about what we 'd hear during the @entity2 season			1
we worried about hearing the voice of that @entity53 kid down the street : his holiday greetings consisted of bad words and 70 mph snowballs			0
we worried about hearing there were no presents this year because , according to @entity61 , " @entity62 " already spent all " @entity62 's " money on cartons of @entity65			2
comparatively then , we were not too worried about whether we heard " @entity2 " or " happy holidays " at school			1
maybe we 've run out of problems			0
maybe it 's because things are so much better now that we focus on that which never bothered us before			2
or maybe it 's because of a growing chasm of distrust between parents and school lesson plans			2
after all , this @entity7 statute was conceived by a legislator who was dismayed to hear his kids report on a " holiday tree " at school instead of a " christmas tree			1
" of course , the @entity84 probably already protects our nonsecular greetings anyway			0
the @entity7 @entity87 's official position is direct , if not hyper - technical : " i think it 's stupid , " said @entity90 , executive director of the @entity87 in @entity7			1
according to @entity92 , there is no " war on @entity2 " and no real need for this law			1
she may be right -- legally , that is			0
the @entity99 cases in this area have focused less on greetings and more on the public display of symbols of the holiday season and whether they are in violation of the @entity105 ( amendment 1 ) of the @entity106			1
the @entity99 recently observed that if a practice " touches upon " religion , it is impermissible under the @entity105 if it advances or inhibits religion in its principal or primary effect			0
the court has held for some time that the @entity105 , at minimum , prohibits government from appearing to take a position on questions of religious belief , or from making adherence to a religion relevant in any way to a person 's standing in the political community			1
with that , some might argue that " @entity2 " is " taking a position " â € ” specifically , an impermissibly @entity129 position on holiday greetings			2
but the @entity99 reminds us what we 've known for a while : @entity2 celebrations can have a religious purpose , but they can also have a secular purpose			1
as long as the state has not impermissibly advanced religion or created an excessive entanglement between religion and government , there is no strict requirement for complete separation between @entity2 and state			1
the @entity99 notes that @entity2 is a holiday recognized by @entity146 and national tradition			2
when the state depicts origins of that holiday , it can do so , and have a legitimate secular purpose			0
legally , @entity2 litigation always raises fascinating and important @entity84 issues			2
however , even this fan of constitutional law must concede that practically , perhaps we should n't be making federal cases out of whether kindergarten teachers can wear a @entity62 hat to class or hand out candy canes			2
as much as it may be a compelling academic question , we have to consider the argument that we are frittering away our valuable court resources on these yuletide issues			0
( then again , maybe determining the limits of the @entity106 is necessarily a worthwhile , albeit costly , investment			2
) ultimately kids do n't even care about " holiday trees , " secular greetings and excessive entanglement			0
it 's the adults : parents , teachers and legislators			0
kids care about one thing : presents			0
especially my 6 - year - old nephews			0
they do n't care if the wrapping paper reads " @entity181 " or " @entity182 " ( way to go , @entity61 )			0
as long as there 's a robot inside			0
and that 's what @entity2 is really about			1
wait a minute , that does n't feel quite right either ... ah well			0
happy holidays , all the same .			1

@entity7 passed a law allowing " @entity2 " and " happy holidays "
@entity193 : @entity106 makes it clear such a law is n't needed
courts are ok with religious *expression* in public places most of the time
@entity193 : government ca n't be entangled with religion , but there 's no strict separation
