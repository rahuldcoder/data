-- i am encouraged by @entity3 's clunky remarks			1
granted , when @entity6 owner made statements about prejudice and @entity9 , they were insensitive and ironic			1
" if i see a black kid in a hoodie and it 's late at night , i 'm walking to the other side of the street , " he said in an interview on inc.com , triggering fresh painful images of @entity14			2
he went on to say if he saw " a white guy with a shaved head and tattoos " he 'd do the same thing			0
the irony is many members of the @entity26 are black , several white players have tattoos and many of them likely have a hoodie hanging in their lockers			0
however , @entity3 was willing to be self - reflective in his attempt to voice his bias and made mistakes in that effort -- that is critically important to advancing our public discourse on the complexities of race in @entity41			1
i do n't think anyone can disagree at @entity44 's basic premise that we all have some level of prejudice or bias			2
yet what rouses emotions to a call for action is the most destructive and violent strains of prejudice , bigotry and racism			0
what we witnessed in the @entity9 interview with @entity59 was not him trying to have an honest conversation about bias like @entity3 ; what we saw was a bigot in denial arguing his case to keep his property			1
that property otherwise known as the @entity69 is slipping from him			0
commissioner @entity70 said @entity9 violated the @entity26 constitution and is confident the league will be able to force @entity73 and his wife to sell the franchise			1
@entity9 has lost his legacy and will be forever known as a disgrace to the @entity26 and an icon of ignorance			1
at this point , the best way @entity73 could change the way he 'll be remembered in history is to come clean			1
" it 's been said the worst thing to be labeled in @entity41 is racist			1
but why the worst ? it certainly is not the most unnatural thing to be , especially if you 're from a certain era or region			0
@entity41 history is steeped in racist institutions , ideology and imagery			1
being a racist in @entity41 is n't the lowest , actually it 's highly probable			1
@entity9 has proven to be an all - star racist and he is part of an @entity41 legacy			1
all men are created equal : an enlightened philosophy , yet a near impossible practice			0
our revolutionary road towards equality is long , bloody , littered with hypocrisy and utterly beautiful			0
what makes this country great is not its perfect walk to freedom for all , but its commitment to paving the way mile by painful imperfect mile			0
racists are not always hateful or uneducated -- they are complicated , resistant , underdeveloped people , often the product of complex , cruel , greedy times and institutions			0
the brutal business of slavery in the @entity41 is older than its @entity126			1
the @entity127 was drafted during the height of the transatlantic slave trade while also slaughtering millions of indigenous @entity41			1
how can @entity41 expect its citizens not to be conflicted ? the foundation of our mighty agricultural economy was built on the international institution of slavery			1
strong black bodies were bought and sold to perform specific work , which they were able to do with superior efficacy			0
the extraordinary physical capabilities and the impressive capacity to adapt and innovate of black men ( and women ) made many white men very rich for many years			0
@entity9 is not so singular , not some ancient artifact -- he has built his wealth on an old successful @entity41 business model			1
he is not alone or fully to blame for his racist mentality			2
the belief that the best use of black and brown people is to serve , labor , produce and entertain is part of @entity41 's long history and continues to this day			1
there are obvious metaphors connecting antebellum plantation operations to @entity9 's comments about his ownership of the @entity69			1
however , we do n't have to look as far back as slavery for support for why his being a racist is n't shocking			2
@entity9 ( born @entity165 ) was born in 1934			1
@entity167 v the @entity166 was in 1954			0
@entity168 was arrested in 1955 and the landmark civil rights decision in loving v the @entity170 happened in 1967			0
@entity9 was an adult with a character and morals already formed before the arrival of the civil rights movement			1
the movement happened but it 's naive to believe the whole country would move with it			2
@entity9 lived and flourished during legal , government sanctioned discriminatory and racists policies			1
wealth for the privileged white male can create a power buffer against the messy work of civil rights			0
clearly @entity73 is a shrewd businessman			1
so if there were no obvious or immediate benefit for him to have an awakening of equality , why would he ? it pays for @entity73 , and has for many others , to be racist			1
to declare , " i am not a racist " while clearly communicating racist beliefs is actually the worst			2
adding insult to ignorance , @entity9 said " i am not a racist " countless times during his interview with @entity59 , alternating it with some of the most racists statements heard in mainstream media this century			1
proclaiming , " i am not a racist " while proving your racist ideology is more insulting and more dangerous than actually being racist			2
denial is more diabolical than ignorance			0
it prevents the possibility of education and evolution			0
it would be far more encouraging if the next @entity73 would just come out say			2
" yes , i am a racist "			2
or during the inevitable awkward public apology , instead of the expected and lame , " if i offended anybody i 'm sorry , " be courageous , admit it : " what i said was racist and i am sorry			2
" now that would be progress			0
it 's also time for @entity41 to be really brave and take full responsibility for its racist past and current racist practices			1
to stop clutching its proverbial pearls every time one of our neighbors or leaders or landlords exposes their racist education			0
our collective denial is stalling our advancement to a more perfect union			0
@entity9 is accomplished and educated , so one can only imagine the beliefs of the scores of less fortunate and underexposed			2
numerous white supremacist groups are thriving right in our back yards			0
they too are citizens stuck in time , pathetically clinging to a bitter romanticized past where @entity41 was ruled solely by white males			2
racists or people holding racist beliefs have to stop being cowards , face their racism and be willing to recover so we can all can get down to the better business of creating a land of the free home of the brave			0
being a racist is not the worst			0
lying about it , denying it and refusing recovery is			0
admitting racism may very well be the first and critical step to actually ending it			0
join us on @entity264 / @entity263 .			0

@entity266 calls @entity3 's comments clumsy , but tepid next to @entity9 's
@entity3 , she said , acknowledged *inherent* prejudices while @entity9 denies them
@entity9 's character was formed in an @entity41 *battling* the birth of the @entity275 , she says
@entity277 : it pays for @entity73 to be racist , so it would be better for him just to own up to it
