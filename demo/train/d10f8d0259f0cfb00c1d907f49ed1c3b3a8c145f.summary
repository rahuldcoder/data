-- it was n't until his senior year of high school in @entity5 that @entity6 found out about his murky immigration status			1
his family had emigrated from @entity9 in 1991 when @entity10 was 5 years old and since then @entity10 , his mother and his brother have lived without legal residency in the @entity13			1
uncertain of what to check under " residency " on his college applications , @entity10 learned at the age of 18 that he was in an ongoing battle to stay in the country he had grown up in			2
" i remember having a huge sense of panic at the time , " say @entity10 , now 25			2
the @entity24 announced reforms this year that would halt the deportations of young immigrants who pose no threat to security			1
it said it also would review almost 300,000 cases on an individual basis -- something it had not been done before			2
individuals without a criminal record are considered low priority for forced or immediate deportation			2
but without permanent relief , many like @entity6 are still in immigration limbo			1
both @entity10 and his older brother , @entity41 , recently received a " stay of removal			0
" this allows them to temporarily stay in the country but without an exact timeline or a plan of action			0
" once we heard about our stay of removal , i was happy but not really excited because i 'm tired and it 's not a permanent solution , " @entity10 says			0
he is facing a situation that many young immigrants confront if their parents come to the @entity13 illegally			1
many say they do n't have a clear map to becoming legal residents in the country they 've grown up in			2
the @entity63 , a nonprofit think tank , estimates that more than 2.1 million adolescents and young adults are in this category			1
@entity10 and his brother came to the @entity13 after their mother , @entity70 , felt it would be unsafe for them to stay in @entity9			1
she was an active member of an opposition party in @entity9 and received several threats from the majority party supporters			1
that 's when she decided to seek political asylum elsewhere			0
" i wanted to go to a free country -- i was scared , " she says			0
@entity10 says he did n't realize the seriousness of the situation until he received a rejection letter after applying at the @entity84 at @entity85			0
the letter said the university would be unable to admit him due to his immigration status			1
determined to move forward , he met with university administrators , who finally agreed to admit him as an international student without any financial aid or scholarships			0
under ordinary circumstances , a student with @entity10 's grades would qualify for financial aid and perhaps even scholarships			0
but any possibility he had for such was lost due to his residency status			2
since graduating from @entity84 in 2008 , @entity10 has been working as a freelance web designer and computer programmer			0
he says he 's been unable to take on a fulltime job even though he 's had several offers -- including one from a start - up in @entity110 's @entity109 -- because his immigration status would n't allow it			1
frustrated , @entity10 wrote a letter to the office of sen. @entity114 's , @entity115 , describing his situation			0
@entity114 shared @entity10 's story on the @entity119 floor earlier this year as a way to drum up support for the @entity122 -- an initiative that would legalize young immigrants who have been in the country for more than five years if they attend college or serve in the military			1
@entity114 alluded to @entity10 's achievements and talent in the technology field saying " we could use people with @entity6 's talent in @entity13			1
" by 2009 , @entity10 's family had already gone through four different lawyers to help them apply for legal status with no avail			1
having spent tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees , and feeling like they had exhausted all of their resources , they made plans to leave for @entity9 because they were constantly facing deportation notices			1
as a final desperate attempt , @entity10 's father , who had obtained residency years ago with a different visa than the rest of his family , decided to hire a lawyer in @entity154			2
the lawyer advised the family not to leave because it would complicate their chances of ever returning to the @entity13			1
with that , the family canceled their plane tickets -- losing half of the money -- and hired that lawyer			0
nine months later , the family received a letter from @entity166 telling them that while immigration officials sympathized with their situation , they would be unable to take any legal action			1
in july 2011 , @entity173 ( @entity173 ) officers took @entity41 into detention			0
he had no past criminal record and was eventually released a few weeks later and given the " stay of removal			0
" " the current immigration laws in the @entity13 are one of many rules but little justice , " says @entity178 , a pro bono immigration lawyer in @entity5 who started working on @entity6 's case last summer			1
" it 's very difficult if not impossible for many people to get legal status			1
" despite recent immigration reforms , @entity10 and his family members live with the fear that they could be asked to leave at any time			2
@entity10 is currently freelancing with a start - up company in @entity110 as a web designer and programmer			0
he 's been unable to accept an offered full - time position with the company because he has n't been able to obtain a work visa			0
as of now , @entity10 's and @entity41 's " stay of removal " is set to expire next summer			0
it 's uncertain whether or not they 'll be able to renew it			2
though exhausted from the battle , @entity10 says it would be very difficult to leave everyone he 's ever known behind -- but adds that very little is in his hands			0
" it 's not something i can or could 've fixed right now			0
it 's something i 've been trying to fight , " he says .			0
