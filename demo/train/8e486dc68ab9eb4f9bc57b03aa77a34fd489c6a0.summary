-- the man who has gone over the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 @entity3 with a fine tooth comb wants @entity5 to make his report public			1
@entity8 's stance puts him at odds with soccer 's world governing body which has insisted the 250 - page report should be kept private			2
the @entity14 lawyer gave the report to @entity5 's ethics chief @entity16 earlier this month			1
" given the limited role mr @entity16 envisions for the @entity19 , i believe it is now necessary for the @entity21 to authorize the appropriate publication of the report on the inquiry into the 2018/2022 @entity26 bidding process , " @entity8 said in a statement			1
" publication would be consistent with statements made by a number of @entity21 members , with the view recently expressed by @entity33 chair @entity32 , and with the goals of the reform process			2
" @entity8 's statement was released ahead of a two - day @entity21 meeting in @entity38 , which begins thursday			0
@entity5 was not immediately available for comment when asked for a response to @entity8 's desire for the report to be made public			1
the 2018 @entity26 was awarded to @entity43 while the 2022 tournament will be staged in @entity45			1
last week @entity5 president @entity46 tweeted : " everyone in the global football community has a responsibility to act ethically			0
football fans rightly demand this			0
@entity5 has taken the lead			0
" however , one of the criticisms leveled at @entity5 is that the organization is not transparent enough and " reform " will not take place without greater transparency			0
some @entity5 officials , notably vice-presidents @entity61 of @entity62 and @entity63 of the @entity64 , as well as executive committee members @entity66 of @entity67 and @entity68 of @entity69 , have all demanded @entity8 's report to be made public			1
for the last four years @entity45 's successful bid has been dogged by controversy			0
issues relating to the feasibility of playing in scorching summer temperatures , the conditions of migrant workers building @entity26 infrastructure and allegations of bribery and corruption have all been raised			0
@entity84 newspaper @entity83 has published a number of stories into the bidding process for the two @entity3 and in one story claimed a @entity45 official paid more than $ 5 million to secure support for his country 's bid			1
@entity45 has said it provided full cooperation to @entity8 and has also said that it won the bid fairly			2
the debate has also raised questions about whether @entity45 could lose the 2022 tournament and , if it did hold the event , at which time of the year it should be played			2
some like @entity101 boss , @entity100 , believe a re-vote is necessary if corruption accusations are proven .			0
