speaking at a joint news conference with visiting @entity7 diplomat @entity10 , @entity3 said he is " very , very thankful " that president @entity12 accepted his proposal to join the review			1
@entity10 is visiting @entity0 after a trip to neighboring @entity16			2
@entity12 and secretary of state @entity17 tapped @entity10 as special representative for the two countries , a signal of how the new administration considers @entity0 and @entity16 intertwined in any solution to the war in @entity0 and the terrorist threat along their shared border			2
at the news conference in @entity1 , @entity10 said sunday that he conveyed the administration 's support of the upcoming elections on august 20 , a date recently set by @entity0 's electoral commission			2
" president @entity12 and @entity17 and the @entity7 government were very gratified to hear president @entity3 reaffirm his support of the august 20 decision , " @entity10 said			1
@entity10 's visit comes as @entity12 plans to send another 30,000 troops to @entity0 to fight what he 's called the " central front in our enduring struggle against terrorism and extremism			2
" in an interview on @entity2 's " @entity46 , " which aired sunday , @entity3 said that , with a resurgent @entity48 , a still - flourishing drug trade and a border with @entity16 believed to be home base for @entity52 , his country ca n't afford for @entity7 troops to leave any time soon			1
" @entity7 forces will not be able to leave soon in @entity0 because the task is not over , " @entity3 said			1
" we have to defeat terrorism			0
we 'll have to enable @entity0 to stand on its own feet			0
we 'll have to enable @entity0 to be able to defend itself and protect for its security ... " then , the @entity7 can leave and , at that time , the @entity0 people will give them plenty of flowers and gratitude and send them safely back home			1
" at the same time , @entity3 said the actions of troops currently in @entity0 have turned some of the public against them			1
" it 's the question of civilian causalities			1
it 's a question of risk of @entity0			0
it 's the question of home searches , " he said			1
" these activities are seriously undermining the confidence of the @entity0 people in the joint struggle we have against terrorism and undermining their hopeful future			2
" we 'll continue to be a friend			0
we 'll continue to be an ally			0
but @entity0 deserves respect and a better treatment			0
" while he said he welcomes additional @entity7 troops , @entity3 suggested they need to work along the @entity0 - @entity16 border and in the poppy fields that fuel a drug trade that threatens to turn the nation into a narco - state -- not in the villages where most @entity0 live			1
" we have traveled many years on			0
what should have happened early on did n't unfortunately happen , " @entity3 said			2
" now , the country is not in the same mood as it was in 2002			0
and so any addition of troops must have a purposeful objective that the @entity0 people would agree with			0
" the @entity12 administration is conducting several reviews of @entity7 policy in @entity0 , including a review by gen. @entity107 , the commander in the region			1
defense secretary @entity109 has said the original mission in @entity0 was " too broad " and needs to be more " realistic and focused " for the @entity7 to succeed			1
" if we set ourselves the objective of creating some sort of central @entity116 over there , we will lose , because nobody in the world has that kind of time , patience and money , " @entity109 said during a recent @entity112 hearing			0
he called for concrete goals that can be reached in three to five years			0
speaking via satellite from @entity1 , @entity3 called former president @entity125 " a great person , " but said he can work with @entity12 -- despite the president 's comments as a candidate that @entity3 had " not gotten out of the bunker " to improve security and infrastructure in @entity0			1
" president @entity12 is a great inspiration to the world , " he said			0
" the people of @entity7 have proven that they can really be the light holders for change and the will of the people in the world			0
" and his coming to power by the vote of the @entity7 people is a manifestation of that great power of the @entity7 people			0
" @entity3 also acknowledged corruption in the @entity0 government , but defended the work he 's done to combat it			1
" sure , corruption in the @entity0 government is as much there as in any other third world country , " he said			2
" suddenly this country got so much money coming from the @entity157 , suddenly so many @entity0 came from all over the world to participate			2
suddenly there were projects -- suddenly there were this poverty that turned into some sort form of prosperity for this country , " he said			0
he said a government department has been created to deal with corruption and that corrupt judges , administrators and other officials are dismissed " daily " over corruption charges .			0
