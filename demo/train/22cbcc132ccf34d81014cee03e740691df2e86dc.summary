@entity0 -- to the list of instructions you hear at airport checkpoints , add this : " put your palms forward , please			0
" the @entity8 soon will begin randomly swabbing passengers ' hands at checkpoints and airport gates to test them for traces of explosives			1
previously , screeners swabbed some carry - on luggage and other objects as they searched for the needle in the security haystack -- components of terrorist bombs in an endless stream of luggage			1
but after the @entity26 attempted bombing of @entity28 over @entity29 , @entity30 , the @entity8 began a program of swabbing passengers ' hands , which could be contaminated by explosive materials , experts say			1
the @entity8 will greatly expand the swabbing in the coming weeks , the agency said			1
" the point is to make sure that the air environment is a safe environment , " homeland security secretary @entity36 told @entity1			2
" we know that @entity41 [ and other ] terrorists continue to think of aviation as a way to attack the @entity45			2
one way we keep it safe is by new technology [ and ] random use of different types of technology			2
" security experts consulted by @entity1 said swabbing hands is a good move , and privacy advocates said they support the new swabbing protocols , provided the agency tests only for security - related objects and does not discriminate when it selects people to be tested			1
it 's a " very good idea , " said security expert @entity62			1
@entity8 screeners currently swab luggage handles and parts of bags that are likely be contaminated by human hands , he said , and swabbing a person 's hands increases the chances of finding explosive materials			1
" looking at the hands means you will probably get a better dose , " he said			0
under the new protocols , tests will be conducted at various locations -- including in checkpoint lines , during the screening process and at gates			2
newer , more portable machines make it easier to conduct tests away from fixed locations such as the checkpoint			2
the @entity8 has more than 7,000 explosive trace detection ( @entity86 ) machines and has purchased 400 additional units with $ 16 million in federal stimulus money			1
the president 's fiscal 2011 budget calls for $ 60 million to purchase approximately 800 portable @entity86 machines			0
@entity93 said the tests will not significantly increase wait times at airport checkpoints			0
the @entity97 has " always supported explosive detection as a good form of security that does n't really invade privacy , " said @entity102 , an attorney and privacy expert with the organization			1
@entity102 said the @entity97 is chiefly concerned that the @entity8 does not discriminate when selecting people for enhanced screening -- something the agency said it does not do -- and that it treat people with dignity			1
" we would not want to see it implemented in a discriminatory fashion , for example , in a disproportionate way against @entity116 and @entity117 or , for example , people with red hair or anything else			0
security experts from across the spectrum will tell you that that 's not just unfair and unjust and not the @entity45 way , it 's also a terrible way to do security , " @entity102 said			1
swabbing also should not be used to test for nonsecurity - related contraband , such as drugs , he said			1
" under the @entity134 , searches in airports are only for the purpose of protecting the security of airline transportation ; they are not general law enforcement stops			0
and so it would n't be permissible for the government to use these trace portal detectors to look for drugs , " @entity102 said			0
the @entity8 said the machines test only for explosives			2
it declined to specify which explosives , citing security reasons			0
because some legal substances -- such as fertilizers and heart medicines -- can result in " false positives , " @entity102 said the @entity97 also wants to ensure that people who test positive be treated respectfully			0
" it 's important that the government treat people who do show up as a positive -- fairly and with dignity -- and not parade them off in handcuffs and treat them as terrorists , but do rational things to investigate what the problem might be , " he said			0
but swabbing hands does not , by itself , raise civil liberty problems , @entity102 said			0
" there 's really not a big privacy interest at stake here , " he said			0
" they are basically looking for particles of explosives , which is not something that people normally have			0

security experts call hand swabbing a good move
@entity187 advocates back tests , provided @entity8 tests only for security , does n't discriminate
