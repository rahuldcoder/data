@entity0 -- in @entity3 , one of @entity0 's most dangerous neighborhoods , many residents stay off the streets to protect themselves from rampant gang violence			1
but one grandmother opened her door and invited gang members to come inside			0
" they say i 'm a nut because i let kids into my home who i did n't even know , " said @entity11 , 54			1
" but i know ( the kids ) now			0
and i 'll know the new generation			0
" since 2003 , @entity11 has gotten to know more than 1,500 young people through her nonprofit community program , @entity18			1
and she hopes that by providing them with support and a place to go , she is also bringing hope to a community in crisis			2
" we are losing a generation to violence , " said @entity11 , who started the program in her living room			1
according to @entity34 , 140 of its students have been shot since the school year started in september			0
" how can a kid get a gun like he can get a pack of gum ? it 's that crazy , " @entity11 said			1
@entity11 , a mother of eight and grandmother to 13 , has lived in @entity3 for 22 years			1
she said she was once " young and dumb , " dropping out of high school and having seven children by age 25			1
but she said that by 36 , she had turned her life around : she got remarried and earned her ged			2
she had also given birth to her eighth child , @entity48			0
this time , she said , she was determined to do things right			0
but when @entity48 became a teenager in 2003 , @entity11 worried that @entity48 and her friends would fall in with a gang			1
after all , gang members lived next door , and there were n't many safe things for teenagers to do			0
" i started taking ( @entity48 and her friends ) to swimming and movies and whatever , " @entity11 said			1
" my mother saw that , and she said : ' @entity11 , why do n't you do something with the kids ? they like you and respect you			1
' " @entity11 was hesitant at first			1
she wanted to focus on being a grandmother and rebuilding her relationships with her older children			2
but after thinking and praying about it , she decided to make use of the natural rapport she had with young people			1
" i invited them into my living room , " she said			0
" they all started saying : ' i want to be a doctor			0
i want to be a rapper			0
i want to be a singer			0
' they did n't want to be out here running up and down the street			0
they wanted to be involved in something			0
" @entity11 told them her house was open 24 hours a day , seven days a week			1
they could come over for food , or homework help , or just to talk about their hopes , dreams and fears			0
" it does n't matter where they come from , what they 've done , " @entity11 said			1
" we 've had six gangs in my living room at one time			0
... but that was the safe place			0
and you know what ? they respected that			0
" as @entity11 began to see positive change in many of the kids , she quit her job as a cosmetologist to focus on them full - time			1
she set up tutoring sessions with teachers and retired educators			0
she provided job interview training and opportunities to play football , basketball and soccer			0
@entity11 and volunteers also started taking the kids on field trips to museums , movies , skating rinks , water parks and professional sports games			1
in 2004 , the group started traveling to other cities across the country , including @entity132 and @entity133 , so they could talk to the young people living there			1
the experiences " let them know there is something beyond their block , " @entity11 said			1
@entity11 has also made many personal sacrifices along the way			1
she sold the family television to put extra money into the program , and she gave away her dining room set to make room for a computer station			0
" we moved into the dining room , and then we moved into one of my bedrooms , " she said			0
" ( at one point ) there were 75 young people in my three rooms			1
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2011 @entity161 in 2008 , just when @entity11 thought her home would burst at the seams , some potential donors came to her home for a visit			1
impressed , several of them pooled their money to buy a bus for the program			0
but a few days later , @entity11 learned the building next door was for sale -- for the same price as the bus			2
" i prayed about it and finally called the donors and asked if the money for the bus could be spent on the building next door instead , " @entity11 said			2
the building was hers , and @entity18 opened the doors of its new home on july 15 , 2010			2
" we call it the @entity188 , and we invite everyone -- all of the youth in the community -- to come , " she said			2
with 301 members from @entity3 , @entity11 said the center has brought community outreach to " a whole new level			1
" every day , 30 to 50 young people show up at the center for tutoring , counseling or activities such as sports , drama , dance or music			1
" @entity18 " caters to people age 11 to 24 , but 80 % of those in the program are male , @entity11 said			1
she emphasizes activities that target males because they are most often perpetrating or confronting the violence of the streets			2
@entity212 , 15 , is one teenager who credits @entity18 with turning his life around			1
@entity212 joined a gang when he was 12 , and he says life in a gang meant looking behind his back every day			2
" we always used to jump on people , rob everything , steal , " he said			2
@entity212 discovered @entity18 when he went to @entity11 's house after school with a friend , @entity11 's grandson			1
there , @entity212 connected with others his age , ate pizza , did his homework , and talked with @entity11 , who invited him to join the group			2
today , @entity212 's grades have improved and he has set his sights on playing football in college			0
without @entity11 and her program , " i would be locked up , ( or ) dead , somewhere beat up , in a hospital , " he said			2
" you name it , i would be there			0
" miss @entity11 , she changed my life			1
i love her for that			0
" for @entity11 , opening up her door was the first step toward change			2
and she hopes other people will follow her lead			0
" if we came outside , we could change so many things , " she said			0
" this community -- if it was once vibrant and safe -- how did it get to this point ? because people started going inside			2
" to help " shock the community " into action , @entity11 set up a stone memorial in front of the community center for all the young people who have lost their lives to violence since 2007			1
there are 220 stones lining the memorial , each representing a victim , and @entity11 said they are still 150 stones behind			2
through her efforts , @entity11 has become a voice for local youth and she wishes more people would take the time to listen to them			1
" our young people need help , " @entity11 said			1
" all of them are not gang - bangers			0
all of them are not dropouts			0
but the ones that are , they need our help			0
somehow or another , something ai n't right here			0
and why do n't we ask them about it ? " want to get involved ? check out the @entity18 website at @entity285 and see how to help .			2

@entity11 is reaching out to young people in her *troubled* @entity0 neighborhood
" @entity18 " provides *recreational* activities and *valuable* life *skills*
@entity11 urges others in the community to listen to children and help them when possible
