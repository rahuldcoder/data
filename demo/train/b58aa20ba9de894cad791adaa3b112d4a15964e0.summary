@entity0 -- a series of e-mail exchanges between officials at the @entity5 shows growing alarm at the amount of projected profit from a government contract for a drug company whose controlling shareholder is a longtime @entity14 activist			1
@entity15 is controlling shareholder of @entity17 and a longtime @entity14 activist and fundraiser			1
he 's also a large contributor to @entity21 , but has been a particular friend of the @entity24 @entity23			0
also on @entity17 's board of directors is @entity26 , former president of the @entity27 , who has had close relations with the @entity24 administration and who has supported president @entity24 's health care initiatives			1
in may 2011 , @entity5 awarded @entity17 a no - bid contract worth nearly $ 433 million to develop and produce 1.7 million doses of an anti-viral smallpox drug called @entity35			1
the drug would augment the existing supply of smallpox vaccine now in @entity40 control			0
according to @entity5 officials , the government has already spent close to $ 1 billion to acquire smallpox vaccine since the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on @entity45 and @entity0			1
a government spokesman told @entity1 that @entity47 is designed to be given over a 14 - day course of treatment , with two pills a day suggested in the event of a smallpox outbreak triggered by a bio-terror attack			1
but internal e-mails obtained exclusively by @entity1 show a contracting officer assigned to manage price negotiations between @entity5 and @entity17 was alarmed at the cost			1
@entity60 's return on investment , one e-mail said , was " an overwhelming 180 per cent			0
" the e-mail went on to say that margin " must be cut in half at a minimum " and later added : " i know you wo n't find a @entity69 ( contracting officer ) in government who would sign a 3 - digit profit percentage			2
" in reply , another @entity5 official , a doctor , agreed			2
" fully concur that 180 per cent is outrageous , " the doctor said in an answer			0
moreover , because taxpayer dollars had been used to fund research and development of the drug , " we should get a major discount given our support of front - end development , " the e-mail states			0
a few weeks later , the ceo of @entity17 , dr. @entity87 , wrote to @entity5 , saying " it was clear that we were at an impasse in negotiations " and urging government officials to remove the existing contracting officer and replace him " with a more senior official			1
" the assistant secretary for preparedness and response , @entity95 , agreed			0
in a letter to @entity99 , she told him she had instructed her officials " to appoint our most senior procurement official as the final authority for this procurement			0
" shortly thereafter , the contract was signed			0
the contract award immediately raised concerns in some sections of the scientific community			2
one smallpox expert , dr. @entity110 of the @entity112 's @entity111 , said @entity35 has not been proven to work			0
" the question is , what will it do in the way of treating a patient who 's had a fever and now has a funny rash that could be smallpox ? " @entity110 told @entity1			1
" will it treat the disease ? i 've seen no data to suggest that it will			0
" the @entity21 chairmen of two @entity23 committees , @entity125 and @entity126 and @entity127 , both wrote to @entity5 demanding all correspondence associated with the contract award and have begun an investigation			2
" you certainly ca n't ignore the political connections between the company and the administration , " @entity133 rep. @entity132 , the chairman of the @entity134 , told @entity1			2
for its part , @entity60 told @entity1 in an e-mail that : " never at any time was any elected official or political official asked to intervene in the procurement process by @entity146 or anyone affiliated with the company			2
" @entity17 's statement but a key @entity14 senator wants an investigation of the contract			1
sen. @entity153 , also of @entity133 , says the no - bid award raises serious questions			1
" was it justified as a no - bid contract ? " @entity153 asked in a press conference last week			1
" overall , i think we need to begin asking policy questions about the kind of money we 're spending developing drugs where the @entity40 is the only customer			0
" a @entity23 spokesman declined to comment to @entity1 and instead referred all questions to @entity5			1
in a written statement , an @entity5 spokesman said the contract was awarded " after a rigorous market analysis determined that @entity17 was the only known company in the world with the capability to produce the required antiviral drug within the required time period			1
" a smaller drug firm based in @entity176 , @entity177 -- @entity178 -- had earlier told government auditors that it could develop a similar drug			2
@entity178 was then given the opportunity to bid for any additional funds beyond the original contract			2
@entity5 also told @entity1 that the price of the drug was of no concern			1
" we ca n't get into the details , but the final rates ended up well within industry standards , " the spokesman said			0
as for replacing the contract officer , the spokesman said : " this change actually resulted in substantial savings for the @entity40 government			2
" that 's something @entity153 questions			2
" if the @entity40 government is going to be the only customer , why is it that the stockholders get all the profit if we 're the ones putting up a significant portion of the development money when , in fact , the @entity40 becomes the only customer ? " she asked			0
as for the replacement of the @entity5 official , @entity60 said in its e-mail to @entity1 : " the findings , the negotiations and the decision to award were handled solely by career procurement officials at @entity5 who negotiated a fair and reasonable price			1
" @entity17 board member @entity219 , appearing on @entity1 's " @entity218 " thursday night , defended the contract process and insisted it followed standard operating procedures			1
" i can tell you not @entity15 , not @entity26 , no member of the ( @entity17 ) board was involved in these contract negotiations and never contacted anybody in the government about this contract , " said @entity219 , who works full time for @entity222 and @entity223 , a company owned by @entity15 , and who also is @entity1 national security contributor			1
@entity219 contended that the contract was put out in a competitive process but " @entity235 ultimately was not competitive in this process			0
" " it ultimately was ... a sole - source contract ... because there was nobody to compete , " @entity219 said			0
" there was nobody ( aside from @entity17 ) with an anti-viral that could meet the government 's standards			1
" she added that the government has given a research - and - development grant to @entity235 to encourage competition			0
" the government has bent over backwards to try and balance the need for an anti-viral against competition , " @entity219 said			0
@entity219 also said the claim that @entity60 's return on investment was 180 % was " inaccurate			0
" however , she said the actual rate was confidential			0
she pointed out that an @entity258 advisory committee will be holding a public hearing on the drug on december 14			0
@entity5 documents obtained by @entity1 also show that as part of the early negotiation process , two key @entity17 executives granted themselves salary increases of $ 200,000 in the case of ceo @entity87 and $ 225,000 for @entity17 chief financial officer @entity267			1
according to the internal memo , dated january 14 , 2011 , @entity60 " now believes a pending government award merits bonuses for the most highly paid executives			0

in may 2011 , @entity17 won a no - bid , nearly $ 433 million @entity5 contract
@entity5 government e-mails obtained by @entity1 show questions were raised
@entity17 's controlling shareholder is a longtime @entity14 activist
@entity5 says " after a rigorous market analysis " the contract was based on @entity17 's ability to produce
