@entity0 -- what does it feel like to kill a man ? @entity5 of @entity6 knew			1
he fought in @entity7 in @entity8 and he killed a @entity10 soldier during a battle in @entity12			1
he described how it felt in a poem : --- i shot a man yesterday and much to my surprise , the strangest thing happened to me i began to cry			1
--- so begins " murder : most foul " a work that echoes poetry about war in the tradition of @entity25 and borrows its title from the bard 's " @entity27			1
" as powerful as the poem is , the story behind it is also fascinating			2
sgt. @entity5 returned home after the war , got married , had children and made a career as a salesman for the meatpacking industry			1
if he ever wrote any other poems , his son , @entity40 , and daughter , @entity42 , who still live in @entity6 , do n't know of any			0
in fact , they did n't know about this poem until after their father died			2
they found it when they were going through his possessions			0
@entity40 and @entity52 found two typewritten pages , each with a copy of the poem			2
it was unsigned , but @entity40 believes the poem was written by his father and later typed up by his mother for safekeeping			1
he says the poem talks of the killing happening in @entity12			2
@entity5 served in @entity12 with the @entity63 , which battled @entity10 units there			1
the poem portrays a soldier very upset about taking a life : --- i knelt beside him and held his hand -- i begged his forgiveness did he understand ? --- but even while he describes the shooting as murder , he makes clear he had no choice : --- it was the @entity8 and he was the enemy if i had n't shot him he would have shot me			2
--- @entity78 said the poem is a bit unlike the father he grew up with			2
a man who could be a " tough customer " if need be			2
not someone tormented by a fleeting , albeit from an intense moment on a battlefield in @entity12			0
" i 'm just starting to appreciate how much he suffered only now in this part of my life			0
when i was a kid , like if he yelled at me or something , i 'd say , ' well @entity93 's being cranky , ' " @entity5 said			1
he said that even though the incident in the poem took place nearly 60 years ago , it resonates today and should let young soldiers coming home from @entity100 and @entity101 that they are n't the first to face such emotional turmoil as this			0
" that feeling they may have of regret and pain and shock of what they 've done			0
it shows they are not alone , " @entity5 said			1
@entity1 sent @entity5 's poem to @entity115 professor @entity114 , who has published several books of poetry , including " @entity118 , " published last year			1
@entity114 called " murder : @entity120 " " accomplished			0
" in an e-mail to @entity1 , he said the poem " is good , and its truths are that of experience and some literary traditions			0
" @entity78 sounded surprised when he heard @entity114 's analysis of his father 's amateur poem			0
" i 'm very deeply touched , " he said			0
" for an expert to assess it that way and make such important comparisons -- i 'm amazed and quite touched			0
" the poetry professor said @entity5 's poem reminded him of a famous portion of @entity25 's play " @entity140 " : --- from this day to the ending of the world , but we in it shall be remembered -- we few , we happy few , we band of brothers --- but @entity114 said it perhaps most closely resembles " the man he killed , " a work by @entity147 written at the start of @entity153 in that poem , @entity147 writes that the soldier and the foe he killed might have shared a drink or loaned each other money had they met somewhere other than a battlefield			1
@entity5 's poem ends not with talk of loans or drinks , but a darker scene			1
--- i shot a man yesterday and much to surprise a part of me died with @entity169 when @entity170 came to close his eyes			0
