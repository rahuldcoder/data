in the last week , the @entity1 @entity0 has made the jump from unlikely rumor to a real product that 's probably in development , thanks to well - placed leaks that have been showing up in various publications			1
the latest is a report from @entity9 that says @entity1 already has a team of 100 employees working on a wearable device			1
the clues , and resulting flurry of speculation , are planting the seeds of an @entity1 watch in consumers ' minds			1
the general public has not been crying out for a better watch			0
@entity1 dream - product rumors have mostly focused on an elusive @entity23 over the past year			2
but @entity1 prides itself on knowing what the people want before they do , and an @entity1 watch would be way more than just a fancy timepiece			1
it 's not about the watch form factor , but creating a wearable mobile device that takes advantage of advances in mobile computing technology such as cheap sensors , better battery life and improved voice recognition			1
an @entity1 watch could work with an ecosystem of third - party wearable sensors and products that tie into one powerful , small hub			1
if executed correctly , an @entity1 watch could spawn a lucrative industry of compatible products , like it did with the @entity45 and mobile applications			1
" it 's unlimited , the number of wearable things you can tap into , " said @entity47 , an analyst with @entity48 , who imagines small companies making inexpensive products like belts with sensors that alert the watch when you 've eaten too much			2
@entity1 is not entering virgin territory			2
there are already a handful of slick smart watches available , but most act as accessories , connecting to the more powerful @entity67 and @entity45 smartphones and tablets over @entity69			1
for example , the new @entity71 smart watch passes on alerts from a smartphone , so when you receive a text , e-mail , or @entity79 notification it is pushed to the watch , which vibrates			0
wearable technology is also booming , thanks to cheap sensors that can be used to track things like movement and heart rates			0
the number of wearable fitness products has been growing at a fast pace , but an @entity1 offering would shake up the industry completely			1
" we 're finally getting some players involved , and @entity1 's the real one , that can add some value to some of this wearable technology , " said @entity47			2
@entity1 is n't alone in seeing the potential for this type of technology			0
@entity102 is working on its own wearable platform , @entity104			0
the two will face off when they are finally available , each sporting its own unique take on what kind of user interface people will use ( voice control and a small touchscreen or augmented reality )			0
and they will , of course , have their own ecosystems of accessories and apps			0
traditional watches have dropped in popularity in recent years			0
smartphones prominently display the time and are already in our back pockets , so it can seem redundant to also strap a small clock to our wrists			0
but when you start packing more power , sensors and connection options like @entity69 into a watch , it ceases to be a watch and becomes a small wearable computer			2
an @entity1 watch could leap frog the current crop of smart watches by creating a platform , not another accessory			1
according to @entity140 , the three tasks people use their smartphones for are , in order , texting , @entity143 and phone calls			0
two out of three of those tasks would be a natural fit for a small device , while the need to surf and play games would ensure the smartphone does n't become obsolete .			0

an @entity1 watch could pass existing smart watches with more computing , sensor power
@entity9 reports that 100 employees are already working on developing the device
a watch could spawn an industry of compatible third - party wearable accessories
