-- silent and shadowy , two hulks lie under the @entity3 's warm waters , unmoved since their deadly encounter 72 years ago during @entity5 now , the future has come to take a closer look			1
from july 6 to 14 , the 211 - foot research ship @entity9 conducted dives to the final resting places of the @entity13 steamer ss @entity14 and the @entity15 , about 45 miles south of the @entity16			1
the @entity14 was torpedoed by the @entity17 while ferrying victims of other @entity20 attacks from @entity21 to @entity22			0
the sub succumbed to depth charges fired from an escort ship			0
these doomed ships are now separated by only two miles of seabed			1
the @entity9 is operated by the @entity28 , a research group founded in 2008 for the purpose of carrying out " pure ocean exploration , " according to the group 's website			1
the ship carries 17 permanent crew members and a rotating , 31 - member @entity36 composed of scientists , engineers and other special personnel			0
it also holds two remotely operated vehicles , @entity43 and @entity44 , which collect data and samples from deep beneath the ocean 's surface			0
the purpose of the @entity9 ' mission to the twin shipwrecks was to perform forensic archeological documentation to more clearly understand their demises , said @entity28 spokeswoman @entity55			1
by the time the team was finished , it had conducted high - resolution mapping of the area and created @entity61 images of the wrecks			2
assisted by the recent findings , archeologists have been able to supplement what they already knew about the attack , @entity55 added			0
" on july 30th , 1942 at 10:30 p.m. , a torpedo from @entity17 hit the [ @entity14 ] , which took about 15 minutes to sink			2
one officer , nine crewmen , and 15 passengers died as the vessel went down , " according to an article on the @entity74 website			0
" once the torpedo was sighted , the passenger ship 's armed escort vessel , @entity75 , dropped several depth charges			0
... those depth charges sank the u-boat with all hands			2
" fifty - two crew members went down with the u-boat , according to an article on the @entity85 's website			0
this sort of @entity88 incursion into @entity13 waters was perhaps more ubiquitous than modern @entity13 believe			2
" historians say u-boats sank at least 50 @entity13 ships in the @entity3 , one in the very mouth of the @entity16			1
@entity13 managed to sink only one u-boat in the @entity3 , " said @entity55			1
the nature of these wrecks as war graves is not taken lightly by the researchers on the @entity9 , according to @entity55 , who quoted the founder of the @entity28 , @entity101 , as saying , " many souls were lost on these wrecks and others , but now they are teeming with corals and undersea creatures			1
it 's the amazing tapestry of life			0
" the @entity9 will continue its expedition in the @entity3 by examining the effects of the @entity112 and is expected to complete its cruise in early october			1
the mission 's progress can be tracked live at the @entity74 website			0
researchers in @entity118 find lost @entity120 @entity5 megasub @entity122 's mission to uncover @entity5 battle cruiser 's final moments			2
