@entity5 even when then - @entity3 gov. @entity2 was n't running for president in 1992 , his presence loomed large over every @entity7 in the race			2
" for more than two months after i announced , the campaign was shadowed by the specter that there might be yet another candidate , " @entity9 wrote about @entity2 possibly entering the 1992 race in his 2004 memoir			1
" many people thought the nomination was his for the asking , and for a good while i thought he would ask			0
" @entity2 , who died thursday at the age of 82 , shared a complicated , yet mutually beneficial , relationship with @entity9 for much of his life			1
though the two sparred early in their careers , they developed a professional relationship that benefited both political families , two of the largest names in both @entity3 state politics and the modern day @entity31			1

@entity9 , obviously , saw things differently , leading to a very clear rift between the two leaders			0
both served as governors in the 80s ( @entity2 in @entity3 and @entity9 in @entity50 ) , but that is where most political similarities ended			1
@entity2 was far more liberal and publicly took shots at @entity9 's welfare reform proposals and his connection with the moderate @entity57			1
the curtness was not one sided , though			0
when @entity59 , on a private call with @entity9 , said she would not be surprised if @entity2 " did n't have some @entity63 major connections , " @entity9 simply responded , " well , he acts like one			1
" the @entity50 governor would go on to apologize for the remark			0
" i fumed in private and said some things about @entity2 i regret , " @entity9 wrote in his memoir			1
" i think i was so stung by his criticism because i had always admired him			0
" but @entity9 also owed @entity2			1
when the @entity3 governor opted not to run for president in 1992 , @entity9 's pathway opened up			0
" on the day @entity2 decided not to run for president , the sigh of relief we @entity78 let out was audible from @entity80 all the way to @entity82 , " said @entity73 after @entity2 's death			0
at the time he dropped out , polls showed @entity2 up more than 20 points on other @entity31 , including @entity9			1
according to @entity85 , a longtime @entity9 confidant , @entity9 was n't daunted , though			0
" @entity9 was disappointed because he was absolutely convinced that he would have beaten @entity2 in the primaries , " @entity85 said in an oral history interview for the @entity87 at the @entity88			2
" he was n't afraid of @entity2 coming in			0
he wanted @entity2 to come in			0
he thought he could beat @entity2			0
" related : @entity90 on death of @entity2 : he was a ' determined champion of progressive values ' the @entity9 - @entity2 relationship never grew into personal closeness , but it did heal from its early 90s low point			1
before the @entity3 primary in 1992 , @entity2 said @entity9 would make a " superb president			2
" and during the @entity98 in @entity3 that year , @entity2 heralded @entity9 , telling the adoring audience that " it 's time for someone smart enough to know ; strong enough to do ; sure enough to lead			2
" @entity2 even served as a surrogate for @entity9 during debates against @entity44			2
@entity2 was a semi-regular presence in the @entity105 , too			0
after @entity9 asked @entity34 to lead his @entity105 's controversial healthcare push , @entity2 jokingly asked , " what did you do to make your husband so mad at you , " according to the first lady 's memoir			1
the relationship improved so much that @entity9 , according to his aides at the time , came within minutes of nominating @entity2 to the @entity115 in 1993			1
" we tried to get @entity2 to accept the @entity115 , " @entity116 , the then - @entity105 counsel , told the @entity87			2
" he would n't return calls for two or three days			0
finally , he did call and told the president he was too busy in @entity82			0
he had some budget — it was crazy , but he turned it down			0
" @entity9 , during a speech in 2012 , said @entity2 was " the first man in the history of this country to turn down a position on the @entity115 , and it 's because he was dedicated to @entity3			1
" the complicated nature of the @entity9 - @entity2 relationship has not been restricted to the patriarchs of both families , either			2
@entity34 is widely seen as the frontrunner for the @entity31 nomination in 2016 , but @entity2 's son @entity135 , who won a second term as @entity3 's governor in 2014 , is considered one @entity7 that could challenge the former first lady			1
