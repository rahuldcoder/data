-- budget airline @entity1 faces an investigation from the @entity4 's consumer and competition authority following allegations of misleading and unfair advertising			1
@entity1 has complained to @entity8 about its ongoing row with the @entity4 's @entity10			1
@entity4 advertising watchdog the @entity10 has referred @entity13 's leading low - cost carrier to the @entity8 after it failed to act on a series of previous warnings over code breaches			1
@entity10 had found the @entity18 airline guilty of seven transgressions in a two - year period , it said on its web site			1
it said @entity1 had exaggerated claims about the availability of flights at advertised prices , and it advertised prices that did not include taxes and charges			0
the @entity10 was also unhappy with @entity1 's " misleading " comparisons with competitors , and that it did not display restrictions that would exclude customers from taking up an offer or provide evidence to prove the claims it was making			1
" it is very disappointing , but absolutely necessary , that we have had to take this course of action , " said @entity10 director general @entity36 , whose authority last referred a company to @entity8 in 2005			1
" the @entity10 has given @entity1 every opportunity to put its house in order and ensure that its advertising adheres to the codes			2
instead , they have continued to mislead consumers and denigrate competitors			0
" we would prefer to work with advertisers within the self - regulatory system rather than call in a statutory body , but @entity1 's approach has left us with no option but to refer them to the @entity8 who will consider appropriate action			1
" last week , @entity1 complained to @entity8 about its treatment by the @entity10			2
it said in a statement on its web site that the @entity10 had " demonstrated a repeated lack of independence , impartiality or fairness where @entity1 is concerned by making factually inaccurate and untrue findings in response ( in some cases ) to totally baseless and unsubstantiated alleged complaints			0
" @entity1 's @entity70 said the @entity10 had " clearly confirmed its bias and blind determination to rule against @entity1 's adverts			2
" in february , @entity1 had to shut down its web site and call centers for three days while it upgraded its reservations system			0
the airline said the move was necessary to make technical changes as it converts to a new system , but @entity8 indicated at the time that the shutdown was due to @entity1 's failure to meet a deadline to list all fares on the site			1
a @entity1 spokesman said the airline was not forced by the @entity8 to shut down its system as a punitive measure			2
he said the web site already complied with @entity8 requirements and simply required an updated system			0
the @entity8 said it took action last year against 13 airlines that did not include " fixed non-optional costs " in prices on their web sites			0
it said 11 airlines amended their sites to make those fees clear , but @entity1 and @entity18 's @entity101 asked for extra time			0
@entity101 met the new deadline , the @entity8 said , but @entity1 did not			0
@entity1 has previously been in trouble over adverts , including one depicting @entity107 president @entity106 and @entity108 before their wedding , and another showing a scantily - clad schoolgirl			0
