@entity0 , @entity1 -- for years , @entity3 flew her single - engine @entity4 across @entity1 , bringing critically ill patients to @entity0 for life - saving medical treatments			1
" i would pick up patients and drop them off ... and they would call a cab , and that was how it was done , " said @entity3 , who was part of a group of volunteer pilots who flew in patients from all over @entity1			1
in 1999 , one of her frequent - flyer patients , @entity18 , called @entity3 and said she would n't be coming in			1
" she started crying and says , ' @entity3 , i do n't have cab fare			1
' " @entity0 , @entity1 , is home to many medical centers , including @entity22 , one of the world 's premier cancer treatment facilities			0
but cab fare from @entity0 's main airports to the treatment centers can range from $ 50 to more than $ 100 each way			1
for patients struggling financially , that expense alone can keep them from getting the treatments they need to stay alive			1
they lose their cars ; they lose their homes			0
they 're living with relatives			0
they would n't have cab fare			1
a lot of people would just stay home and die , " said @entity3 , 60			1
" and that 's just not acceptable			0
" so @entity3 started a group she called @entity48 , organizing volunteers to drive patients to and from @entity0 's airports and treatment centers for free			1
today , driving her red pickup along @entity1 highways , @entity3 credits @entity18 -- who passed away in 2001 from colon cancer -- as the inspiration for the program			1
do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2010 @entity61 " i said , ' @entity18 , i 'll drive you down			1
' i put her in my truck and went downtown			0
and then , all of the sudden , it just popped in my head , ' i wonder if [ other people in ] @entity0 would be interested in this ? ' " @entity3 placed an ad in the @entity70 calling for volunteer drivers , and the response was overwhelming			1
about 300 people called to sign up			0
at the time , @entity3 was a single mother of five working full - time at an oil refinery			2
she spent her spare time coordinating the drivers , or " ground angels			2
" when pilots alerted @entity3 that they were flying in a patient , she would arrange for a ground angel to meet them			1
" i was on the phone all the time			0
i carried a spiral notebook with all the volunteers ' names and numbers in it , " @entity3 said			2
ultimately , the pilots liked the program so much that they asked to join , and the organization became the @entity48 and pilots			1
today , the group includes nearly 50 pilots and 300 drivers			1
patients contact the organization to request ground transportation from a @entity0 airport or a flight from their regional airport			2
requests are posted on the group 's website , and volunteers sign up for each " mission			2
" missions take place seven days a week			2
rides are provided to patients who arrive into the @entity0 area on a commercial flight or who 've been flown in to a regional airport by one of the program 's pilots			2
the group also helps fly in patients from the @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 by working with other volunteer flying organizations whose pilots cover part of the distance			1
since 2001 , the group has completed about 6,000 missions -- most of them rides , along with hundreds of flights			1
@entity3 says many volunteers are drawn to the group because they have lost loved ones to cancer			1
@entity136 , 62 , has been relying on the group for eight years			2
after she was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2001 , the cost of treatment crippled her financially			2
unable to work , she lost her home and her car			0
@entity136 , who lives about 4Â½ hours from @entity0 by car , was referred to @entity22 but lacked the funds or transportation to get there			0
with the help of @entity3 's team , @entity136 has been able to fly into @entity0 and get treated			2
she credits the volunteers with giving her hope			0
" they 've saved my life , " @entity136 said			0
" anytime that i need to come up here , they do it			0
the ground angels have everything set up			0
i do n't have to worry			0
i would have died a long time ago , because they have nothing like this down where i live			0
" patients receiving transportation from @entity3 's group must submit proof of their medical need			1
those requesting flights also must have a letter from their doctor saying that they need air transport and that they are well enough for it			2
recently retired , @entity3 is now a full - time volunteer			1
she and her team aim to make sure that patients coming into town for treatment travel without stress			0
" there 's no worry , because there is going to be somebody that 's going to fly them , " she said			0
" there will be somebody that will pick them up			0
they 're not thrown to the wolves in the big @entity0 metropolis , of being afraid of where to go			0
" @entity3 -- who has also opened her house to patients who ca n't afford a place to stay -- said the program hits home the most when she sees patients thriving despite being told they had a limited life expectancy			1
" they tell us all the time that they get their strength through us , " she said			0
" if they only knew it 's the other way around			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity207 website at @entity208 / and see how to help			0
