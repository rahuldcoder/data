-- @entity1 , a terminally ill former @entity2 follower convicted in the murder of actress @entity4 , on tuesday was denied a compassionate release from prison			1
@entity1 , @entity7 's longest - serving female inmate , is shown in her most recent mug shot			1
@entity1 , 60 , has been diagnosed with brain cancer and has had a leg amputated , her attorney said			1
in june , she requested the release , available to terminally ill inmates with less than six months to live			1
the @entity15 ' decision -- posted tuesday on its web site -- came after a public hearing on @entity1 ' request			1
it means the request will not be forwarded to the @entity21 that sentenced @entity1			1
the court would have had the final say on @entity1 ' release			1
her attorney , @entity25 , called the parole board 's decision " unfortunate			0
" " [ the board ] ignored the vast majority of evidence presented , " @entity25 said			0
" there was a huge amount of pro-compassionate release testimony from many witnesses			0
it apparently fell on deaf ears			0
" known within the @entity2 as @entity1 , @entity1 and four others were convicted in connection with the deaths of five people , including @entity41 , in august 1969			1
according to historical accounts of the murder , @entity1 stabbed @entity41 , who was eight months pregnant , and scrawled the word " pig " in blood on the door of the home the actress shared with director @entity50			1
by her own admission , @entity1 held @entity41 down and rejected her pleas for mercy , stabbing the pregnant woman 16 times			1
@entity1 ' request roused long - dormant memories of the two - day killing spree that terrorized @entity59 and left seven people dead			1
it polarized those who were involved in the case -- and even those who were n't -- over whether she should die behind bars			0
@entity1 told a 1993 parole board that @entity41 pleaded for her unborn child 's life as she held her down			1
" she asked me to let her baby live , " @entity1 said			1
" ... i told her i did n't have any mercy on her			0
" three of @entity41 's houseguests were also slain by the killers , as was a teenager visiting the home 's caretaker in his cottage out back			0
@entity1 was also convicted in the earlier murder of music teacher @entity2			1
one of the first people @entity1 confessed to was @entity82 , who shared a cell with her before investigators determined the @entity2 was responsible for the murders			1
@entity86 said last month she believed @entity1 should die in prison			1
" she showed that poor woman absolutely no mercy , none , " @entity86 said			0
" so why should anybody show her mercy at this time ? " @entity4 's sister , @entity93 , has staunchly opposed @entity1 ' release			1
" she will be set free when judged by @entity96 , " @entity95 has said			0
" it 's important that she die in incarceration			0
" @entity100 district attorney @entity99 said monday he was strongly opposed to the release , saying in a letter to the board it would be " an affront to people of this state , the @entity108 criminal justice system and the next of kin of many murder victims			0
" @entity111 noted in his letter that @entity1 was initially sentenced to death , like others in the @entity2 , including its leader , @entity2			1
their sentences were commuted to life in prison in 1972 , when the @entity122 @entity121 struck down the death penalty laws as they were written at the time			0
@entity108 gov. @entity125 said tuesday he was also opposed to releasing @entity1			1
" i do n't believe in [ compassionate release ] , " the governor told reporters			0
" i think that they have to stay in , they have to serve their time			0
" even if @entity1 is dying , @entity125 said , " those kinds of crimes are just so unbelievable that i 'm not for the compassionate release			2
" earlier , @entity133 , director of adult prisons in @entity108 , also recommended against granting @entity1 ' request			2
@entity136 , who prosecuted @entity137 and other members of the @entity2 , said he supported her release , if only to save the state money			2
through monday , the cost for @entity1 ' medical care since she was hospitalized march 18 totaled more than $ 1.15 million , and the costs for guarding her hospital room are more than $ 308,000 , said @entity147 spokeswoman @entity145			2
terminally ill inmates rarely are allowed compassionate release , records show			1
in 2007 , 60 such requests were made to the department , @entity145 has said			0
@entity1 , who has been incarcerated since 1971 , is @entity108 's longest - serving female inmate			2
according to a web site maintained by her husband and attorney , @entity156 , she is now a born - again @entity157			0
during her incarceration , the site says , @entity1 worked to help at - risk youth , violent crime victims and homeless children , among others			2
the web site does not mention @entity1 ' illness			2
@entity25 said last month @entity1 is paralyzed on one side			2
" she can talk a little bit , " @entity25 said			0
" she ca n't sit up in bed without assistance , and obviously she ca n't walk around because she 's an amputee			0
" @entity1 has expressed remorse for her crimes			2
" i know the pain i caused mrs. @entity4 , " she said at a parole board hearing in 1985			2
ln may , authorities dug for buried bodies at the @entity178 , @entity108 , ranch where @entity2 and his followers once lived , after police became aware that testing had indicated human remains might be buried there			0
