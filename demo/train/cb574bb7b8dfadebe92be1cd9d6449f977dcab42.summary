-- trading of @entity3 equities on " dark pools " has grown by almost a half in the past three years to account for nearly a third of total market volume , according to research that underscores the challenge facing international regulators			1
the shift from transparent public exchanges has highlighted growing concern among asset managers and global regulators about off - exchange trading , where prices are reported only after deals are executed			1
such venues allow investors to trade large blocks of shares anonymously , with prices posted publicly only after trades are done			0
they have grown popular with asset managers as they minimise the risk of the market moving against them when executing a large order , or of seeing their order sliced up by high - frequency traders			2
however authorities in the @entity3 , @entity33 and @entity34 are considering tighter regulation of such alternative trading venues amid fears that they could further fragment trading and dent the integrity of public markets			2
a survey by the @entity43 - based @entity42 found that trading of @entity3 equities on dark pools had risen 48 per cent since the start of 2009 to account for about 31 per cent of total consolidated volume , as of march			1
the @entity42 used data from @entity51 , as it collates the vast majority of equities trading data in the @entity3			1
@entity54 , director of capital markets policy at the @entity42 and author of the report , estimated that there was a similar proportion in @entity33			0
" the results suggest that dark trading does not harm market quality at its current levels but the gains are not indefinite , " he said			0
" if the majority of order flow is filled away from pre-trade transparent markets , investors could withdraw quotes because of the reduced likelihood of those orders being @entity72 would be prudent for authorities to monitor these developments closely , " he said			0
the study calculated that about 18 per cent of total volumes of trades were executed on broker - dealers ' own trading desks -- a process known in the industry as " internalisation "			0
that figure included virtually all retail orders , mr @entity54 said			0
other block - trading venues , whether independent or bank - owned , accounted for 8 - 13 per cent of consolidated volume , the @entity42 said			1
it called on broker - dealers to provide significant price improvement offer better prices for retail orders that are internalised , or route the order to public exchanges , so it could be executed against the order book			2
mr @entity54 said such moves would help to uphold market integrity			0
" it would thus minimise any disincentive to post displayed limit orders and would uphold market integrity , " said mr @entity54			0
the @entity42 called on regulators to monitor the growth in the proportion of dark volume trading and improve the reporting and disclosure around the operations of dark pools			1
last week , an annual survey by @entity111 , the @entity3 capital markets consultancy , highlighted growing industry worries about market quality , shrinking commissions and widespread restructuring among broker - dealers .			1
