-- leave it to a scientist to spoil the fun about a cartoon fish			1
" @entity15 " was the @entity7 - winning , box office animated smash about a clownfish who goes after his young son , who 's been plucked from the sea and ends up in a fish tank in a dentist 's office			1
rare is the child who has n't seen the movie			0
so would n't it be something if the film or its upcoming sequel accurately depicted the life of a clownfish , writes @entity25 of @entity26			1
he 's a fish biologist at @entity29 with 15 years of experience			0
his blog post monday wondered if it would be so bad if @entity33 showed how clownfish often change sex			2
yes , in real life , @entity15 might become a woman			1
@entity38 are sequential hermaphrodites , which helps keeps the species going by keeping the number of adult females and males fairly equal			0
all young clownfish become male			0
and after they pair off , the dominant dude becomes a female			0
( @entity49 alert ) this means that if @entity15 's mom is killed ( as are most of the clownfish ) and @entity15 hangs out with his dad after they are reunited , then one of them is going to become a woman ( likely dad )			1
or if dad gets fished , then @entity15 might become a girl when he pairs off with another male			0
" although a much different storyline , it still sounds like a crazy adventure ! " @entity25 writes below the headline " @entity15 lied to your kids			2
" actually it sounds like he was just trying to use " @entity15 " for a little fish education			0
" we are just having some fun here pointing out the crazy life cycle of clownfish while associating it with something people are familiar with ... @entity15 , " the blog says in the comments ( which correctly point out that fish do n't actually talk )			1
perhaps there 's still time the to work the lesson into the sequel , " @entity81 , " which is due in 2015 .			2

" @entity15 " is about a clownfish 's quest to *rescue* his son
in real life , one clownfish changes sex when they pair up
biologist wonders would it be so bad if kids learned that in a fun cartoon
there is a movie sequel *planned* for 2015
