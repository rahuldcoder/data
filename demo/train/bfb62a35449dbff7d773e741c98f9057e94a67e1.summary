sen. @entity0 appears to be warning former @entity2 gov. @entity1 and other potential 2016 candidates that support for @entity5 would be a losing position in the @entity8 presidential contest			1
" if there 's a @entity8 candidate out there -- let 's just say there 's a hypothetical one that 's for @entity5			1
i 'm saying that that hypothetical candidate that 's for @entity5 probably does n't have much chance of winning in a @entity8 primary , " the @entity15 @entity8 told @entity16			2
his comments , published monday , come from an interview last week while @entity0 was in @entity23 campaigning for @entity25 hopeful @entity24 and rep. @entity26			2
@entity0 did n't mention @entity1 or any other potential 2016 candidate by name , but the former @entity2 governor has been a vocal backer of @entity5 , a set of national education standards for @entity32 and math. " the danger of having one central governmental authority deciding curriculum is , what if we get some people who decide we really need to treat @entity39 fairly , we need to make sure he gets a good writeup in the history , and @entity43 , oh gosh , he was terrible , " @entity0 said			1
" you can see how once it 's nationalized , one person can insert a bias into the curriculum , and it goes everywhere , and then you have to fight it			0
" while conservatives accuse the program of interfering with local government control , the standards were developed by the bipartisan @entity54 , state governments and nonprofit groups			2
but if states want a share of president @entity59 's @entity61 education grants , one of the ways to get it is by adopting @entity5			2
in that sense , the government created incentives for states to embrace the standards			0
@entity1 , who was campaigning for @entity24 in @entity23 the week before @entity0 was there , reiterated his support for @entity5 , according to the @entity70			1
@entity24 did not express the same support and attacked the @entity72			0
@entity1 says the standards help prepare students for college and the workforce			1
@entity78 gov. @entity77 has also offered support for @entity5 , though he created a panel to review and improve the program 's implementation in the @entity78			1
@entity84 of @entity85 and @entity86 of @entity87 have been fiercely opposed			0
@entity84 sued the @entity59 administration over the issue this year and announced plans to take @entity85 out of the program , while @entity87 was one of five states that did n't adopt the standards at all			0
in the @entity25 , republicans @entity95 of @entity87 and @entity97 of @entity2 are two potential presidential candidates who have also been highly critical of @entity5			1
@entity0 has previously weighed in on his disdain for the program , saying in august that he believes education standards " should be developed locally " and reiterating his wish to eliminate the @entity72			1
" the kids are tested to death , i think , and not necessarily any smarter , " he said at a @entity8 event in @entity103 , @entity104			0
" is testing good ? yes , but i would let local people figure that out			0
" " i also think we make a mistake as republicans blaming teachers for everything , you know , because frankly some of the fault ... we need to look in the mirror ; it 's parents ' fault as well , " he continued .			0
