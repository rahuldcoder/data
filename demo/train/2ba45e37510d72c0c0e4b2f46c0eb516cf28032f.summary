-- @entity2 's @entity1 , an 18th century brick building replete with clock tower and cockerel wind vane , was restored a decade ago with great care			0
@entity6 were treated with plaster lined with horse hair , while the beams were strengthened with nails designed not to split the aged wood			0
traditional techniques dating back to biblical days were used , ensuring the building 's historic value was retained			0
it 's a $ 1.6 million job @entity17 is particularly proud of			0
the building was once the business center of the town , and it now appears in the @entity21 of @entity23 's logo			1
for the owner of @entity23 's @entity26 , which employs just 40 people , this shows how apparently minor players , like @entity23 if it becomes independent , can achieve big things			1
@entity17 sees his company as a metaphor for the benefits of a " yes " vote			0
he is supporting the campaign for an independent @entity23 , one which has sent shudders through @entity38 -- and further afield -- as it gains traction ahead of thursday 's vote			1
polls show the vote is on a knife edge , and the uncertainty has already hit the pound , prompted banks to threaten to quit @entity23 and forced @entity48 governor @entity47 to warn of currency risks of a breakaway			2
a split would end the 307 - year union with @entity48 and @entity53 as @entity54 , which has helped push @entity23 to its affluent position on the global stage			2
but , its detractors argue , it 's also held it back from its full economic potential			0
for @entity17 , the @entity2 leader of pro-independent group business for @entity23 , the economics can be seen as more simple			1
he sees his company as a microcosm of the bigger debate			0
in a small , independent business , it 's " easy to change things , it 's easy to make fast decisions , " he said			2
" i used to be a minority shareholder in much larger company and making good decisions , and changing things is ten times more difficult			0
" @entity23 's riches @entity23 is richer , per capita , than the @entity76 , a fact the independence campaigners love to champion			1
its access to oil pushes its gdp per person to 115 % of the @entity76 's , according to the @entity23 government , making it the world 's 14th richest country			1
the @entity76 ranks at number 18			2
@entity23 's total gdp was $ 240 billion in the year to first quarter of 2014 , around 8 % of total @entity76 gdp			1
@entity23 's economic output per head is also the highest in the @entity76 outside @entity92 and the @entity93 of @entity48 , according to national statistics			1
beyond oil , a global taste for @entity23 whisky boosts its economy , with food and drink making up nearly a fifth of its $ 40 billion exports internationally , government figures show			1
@entity23 exports a further $ 75 billion worth of goods and services into the @entity76 -- which , the pro-independence camp says , means an independent country could claim to be a significant global exporter			1
but the @entity23 have been hit hard by the recession			2
during its most painful year , 2009 , the country 's economy shrank by 6 % , lagging behind the rest of the @entity76 , where the contraction was 4 %			1
productivity and average household incomes are also below the overall @entity76 levels			2
but those promoting a breakaway say the country would be more resilient and would have survived the recession better had it not been in @entity38 's shadow			0
@entity123 's economic advisory body -- which includes @entity125 laureate @entity124 -- has argued economic policies tailored to local needs would boost growth			0
@entity130 could , for example , aim its tax policies at helping the crucial exporters			0
" @entity23 has certain unique industries which are incredibly important to it , but from @entity38 point of view are lower down the agenda than they would be in independent @entity23			1
" whisky , gas and tourism are high on that list , he said			0
and oil is the trump card			0
the question of oil @entity23 's black gold is used by both sides to bolster their arguments			1
around 90 % of the @entity76 's oil comes from @entity23			1
the @entity23 government says it has up to 24 billion barrels of oil reserves in the @entity151 , which could generate up to $ 2.4 trillion in revenue			1
such wealth plays directly into the independence debate			0
the bulk of oil workers want @entity23 to become independent , with 70 % telling pollsters they 're set to vote in favor			1
@entity159 , chief executive of the @entity161 recruitment company , which commissioned the research , said the industry 's workers " are not getting scared " by the " no " campaign			0
the @entity23 government is also promoting the idea of an oil fund , such as that in @entity169 , which indirectly supports social spending -- something the @entity76 government has not done			1
but others warn @entity23 's oil riches could prove more fleeting than the " yes " campaigners suggest			1
last month @entity23 billionaire oil magnate @entity177 stirred the debate by claiming @entity23 oil reserves could be completely depleted by 2050 , saying the country had between 15 and 16.5 billion barrels of oil still available			1
his stance -- supported by @entity76 oil giant @entity184 -- was rejected by the pro-independence campaign			2
@entity23 's oil production has been declining steadily over the past decade			1
it dropped more than 10 % in both 2013 , following a decline of 14 % in 2012 , according to the @entity23 government			2
the decline has been offset by rising oil prices			0
the currency headache the currency question remains @entity23 's thorniest			1
in the past , the @entity23 government has promoted the idea of joining the euro			2
but with the 18 - country bloc struggling to emerge from crisis and facing further slowdown as its relations with @entity201 deteriorate , the idea has been dismissed			0
now , it 's seeking a currency union with the rest of the @entity76 , similar to the one @entity206 countries had before joining the euro			1
but @entity76 prime minister @entity208 has whole - heartedly rejected the idea and it 's one on which @entity23 first minister @entity211 has come unstuck in political debates , unable to offer a clear answer to the question so many investors are asking			1
but the political point - scoring might prove just that : @entity124 and his fellow advisers say a common currency may be forced upon @entity23 and the rest of the @entity76 by economic necessity			1
the cost of splitting the currency would be simply to high for both sides of the border			0
it 's the economy , stupid ahead of the referendum , @entity23 are split on their ambitions			1
while the economic partnership is central to the debate , campaigners are going for hearts over heads			0
the independent " yes " campaign is trundling out pictures of happy children , prosperous towns and beautiful @entity23 countryside			2
the " better together " campaign emphasizes the strong tradition of the union , and at times uses scare tactics			0
the uncertainty is already being blamed for destabilizing the economy			0
@entity248 , head of engineering company @entity249 , penned an open letter with 200 other business leaders warning their compatriots about the costs and unknown consequences of a vote for independence			2
@entity248 believes @entity23 will ultimately be swayed by the impact on their wallets			2
" we are all proud @entity23 , and [ emotions ] will influence [ us ] to varying degrees			2
but what is clear from the opinion polls is that the economy and the arrangements to secure the future business of @entity23 are the number one issue , " @entity248 said			1
for @entity17 , however , that impact is the opposite to what @entity248 argues			0
during his two decades in business , @entity17 has put his business stamp on numerous projects in @entity2			0
he employs locally and he relies on @entity23 suppliers , including for the special nails used in the @entity1 refurbishment			0
blunt , but with sharpened sides , they reflect the type of nails used in biblical times , for crucifixions , according to @entity17			0
such supplies are difficult to find , but those used for this most delicate project were manufactured in @entity287 .			0

business and economy is at the top of the agenda ahead of the @entity23 independence referendum
@entity23 's access to oil pushes its gdp per person to 115 % of the @entity76 's
strong @entity23 exports , both internationally and to the rest of the @entity76 , drive the economy
