-- after a friday night showdown that heavily tipped the scales in favor of the survival - horror thriller " the purge : anarchy , " " @entity9 " came back strong this weekend to take the no. 1 spot at the box office			1
the " @entity14 " sequel , starring motion - capture master @entity11 as the hyper - evolved higher primate named @entity13 , collected $ 36 million for the weekend , according to sunday estimates			0
meanwhile , " the purge : anarchy , " a follow - up to last year 's nightmare - inducer about a 12 - hour period when no crime is illegal , garnered only $ 28.3 million			1
" @entity27 " was n't entirely beloved by its terror - craving audience , getting only a b from the polling firm @entity24 € ” compared to the a-minus received by " apes			1
" so - so word - of - mouth may have led to the saturday stumble			0
it 's still a terrific opening for the @entity32 horror movie , which cost only $ 9 million to make ( compared to an estimated $ 170 million budget for the " @entity14 " film , which has earned back only $ 138 million domestically so far			1
) the winner there is obvious			0
@entity38 in talks to direct ' @entity40 ' prequel " @entity14 " is off to a strong start after only two weeks , however , and if it can maintain that it will stand as one of the stronger films of summer			0
for a while on friday , it seemed " purge " would take not just the spoils but the title as well			0
the movie earned $ 13 million from friday night showings , compared to " @entity14 ' " lackluster $ 10.4 million , a 62 percent drop from its opening night a week before			0
but " @entity14 " rallied big time on saturday , earning $ 14.8 million to " purge 's " $ 9.5 million , which was a 27 percent drop from its opening night			2
the writing was on the wall : the " apes " had it			0
the no. 3 slot went to " planes : @entity69 , " a @entity63 sequel to last year 's family comedy about adventurous airplanes , spun - off from @entity67 's " cars " universe			1
with only $ 18 million -- $ 4 mil less than the first " planes " -- that 's a pretty bad stall for a family movie in the middle of summer			2
it 's low friday gross of $ 6.3 million seemed like it may simply have been a reflection that not many adults turned out on opening night for kiddie fare			2
but then " @entity69 " did n't do much better during family - friendly matinee hours of saturday , earning $ 6.6 million			0
the @entity81 rating was an a , so those who did turn out enjoyed what they saw			0
the same ca n't be said for @entity86 and @entity87 's " @entity85 , " which nabbed a dismal c - plus @entity81 , and opened in fourth place with only $ 15 million			1
@entity86 had been on a comedy hot - streak lately , and this raunchy slapstick about a couple trying to prevent their friends and family from seeing an accidentally - uploaded boudoir video seemed like it would be primed to continue the trend			1
@entity97 : is this a ' @entity85 ' you 'd pay to see ? but there was no " bad teacher " here			1
critics were cruel , and audiences did n't disagree			0
" director @entity103 , who also helmed ' bad teacher ' ... does n't quite seem to know what tone he 's going for , and the last half of the movie veers wildly between crude hard - r comedy and warm - hearted teachable moments			1
blessedly , it 's also short , " wrote @entity0 's @entity110			2
in limited release , @entity113 's partially @entity114 - donation - funded " @entity112 " opened in 68 theaters and earned $ 495,000 for a relatively strong $ 7,300 per screen			1
" @entity121 " director @entity120 's whimsical @entity119 dramedy " @entity122 " collected $ 25,100 in two locations , for an average of 12,550 per screen			2
the philosophical sci - fi saga " i origins " earned $ 28,700 in four locations , for an average of $ 7,175 , while " persecuted , " a paranoid thriller about a preacher framed for murder , straddled the wide - release / limited - release framework by launching in 736 theaters , but earning only $ 959,000 , or $ 1,300 per screen			2
here 's the top five : 1			1
" @entity9 " -- $ 36 million weekend ( $ 138 domestic total ) 2			1
" the purge : anarchy " â € ” $ 28.3 million weekend ( new ) 3			0
