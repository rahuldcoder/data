-- at the start of the 1980s there were more than a million elephants in @entity4			1
during that decade , 600,000 were destroyed for ivory products			2
today perhaps no more than 400,000 remain across the continent , according to @entity7 of the @entity8 , who is widely recognized as an authority on the subject			2
it is a tragedy beyond reckoning and humanity needs to pay attention to the plight of the elephants before it is too late			2
in the past few years an epic surge in poaching has resumed the killing , thanks to the penchant for ivory in the @entity24 market -- especially in @entity25 , where ivory is now selling for over $ 1500 a kilo			1
recently , @entity28 , the head of the @entity29 , made a plea at the @entity31 in @entity32 in an unprecedented appeal for the world to save @entity35 's and @entity4 's elephants from the plague of poaching that has in recent years seen the decimation of tens of thousands of them			1
interactive : @entity42 conservation hits and misses it is an appeal that follows from @entity35 's determination to torch about 10 tons of ivory last july near @entity48 in a show of disdain for the destroyers of elephants and disgust at the resumption of poaching			1
if this level of killing continues , if elephants continue to be slaughtered for trinkets and statuettes , in 10 years ' time most of @entity4 's elephants will be gone and an ineffable symbol of majesty and wonder -- and the linchpin in the ecology of an entire continent -- will have been consigned to oblivion			1
a recent @entity70 hearing in @entity32 called " @entity71 -- the @entity72 in @entity4			1
" underscores the significance of this issue			0
@entity75 , founder of @entity77 , @entity76 , the secretary general of the @entity78 and @entity79 ( @entity80 ) , and sen. @entity81 underscored not only the implications of elephant and wildlife poaching , but also the criminal syndicates who make billions on the illegal wildlife trade , as well as its impact on local populations in @entity4 , global security and even terrorism			1
an urgent and concerted international will is needed to fund law enforcement to protect what remains of the elephant population of the world			1

millennia - old elephant migration paths have been disrupted			2
climate change is a menace to the elephant and all life			2
but the wanton shooting of the innocents to satisfy vanity has reached a level of madness no one can ignore			0
this is perhaps made most clear in the recent destruction of 400 elephants in the @entity116 by armed militia from @entity118			2
the killing of elephants is not just a wildlife issue			0
the world now understands that it is a global issue			0
not long ago the @entity125 's independent newspaper proclaimed that the loss of biodiversity was the greatest threat to humanity			0
how , amidst @entity133 's missile - defense problems in @entity134 , a possible nuclear iran and the economic failings of modern nations , unemployment and inflation , can the future of the elephant be so urgent ? it is not on the radar of the media nor is it a priority for most people			1
the answer comes from our ability to affirm life in its moral , ethical and , i would urge humanity to consider , in its spiritual dimensions			0
the elephant helped us walk out of @entity4 perhaps 60,000 years ago			1
we learned from tribal elders in east @entity4 that elephants , because they knew where to find water , helped humanity survive			1
it was alongside them that we populated the @entity160			0
they are central to our evolution			0
@entity163 of the @entity163 has even said that to save the elephant is " an urgent moral imperative			0
" read more : beauty trumps beast in conservation efforts in @entity169 , in 2010 , world environmental ministers agreed on a global strategy to combat the loss of biodiversity			0
those countries in @entity24 that are the driving force behind the mutilation of the greatest land mammal on @entity177 must join the battle to save the elephant in @entity4 and the elephant in @entity24 and the planet 's other endangered fauna , such as the rhino and tiger and all the other species that are being so ruthlessly ransacked			1
in so doing they will save face			0
in a society fixated on growth and money , @entity188 , ( @entity188 ) has plainly demonstrated the irreplaceable value of biodiversity , which yearly provides trillions of dollars of value			0
the forests , oceans , whales and elephants of the world must now enter the balance sheet of ultimate consideration			1
we have reached the point as a global civilization where we must fight for life and the meaning of life , and much of that stands in the body of the elephant and other fellow species , as well as the forests and the oceans of the world			1
this battle must not be lost			0
elephants are one of the pillars of existence			0
we must never tell nor have to tell the children -- " this is where the wild things were			0
" the opinions expressed in this article are solely those of @entity227 .			2

elephant figures are *dramatically* *decreasing* *due* to poaching and black market ivory trade
@entity227 says in 10 years time , if slaughter continues most of @entity4 's elephants will be gone
the world faces losing the " linchpin of ecology of an entire continent "
