-- at the @entity4 , @entity3 men 's tennis was the talk of the town			1
@entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 were being dubbed the " @entity11 , " a reference to the " @entity13 " from the same nation who dominated tennis in the late 1920s and early ' 30s			1
@entity7 was the big - hitting , charismatic leader of the bunch ; child prodigy @entity8 , with his smooth one - handed backhand , was likened to an artist ; @entity9 played defensive tennis like no other but also possessed the requisite punch on his strokes ; and @entity10 owned the rare ability to turn defense into offense in an instant			1
but five years on , that optimism has lessened			0
emulating @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 -- who collected 20 grand slam singles titles , 23 in doubles and helped " @entity38 " win six consecutive @entity37 trophies -- looks out of the question			1
in fact , just one grand slam singles title would do -- @entity3 's last by a male player came 31 years ago , courtesy of @entity46			1
given the grip of the so - called " @entity49 " on the men 's game -- and the performances of @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 -- even that appears uncertain , although @entity55 's surprise @entity54 victory gives the quartet hope			1
in @entity60 in january , some members of the @entity3 media lamented a familiar pattern at grand slams recently : handfuls of @entity3 men appear in the singles draw but not many reach the quarterfinals or beyond			1
none landed in the last eight at that @entity54 , and none made the last 16 at last month 's @entity70 in @entity71 -- arguably the most prestigious regular - season tournament outside the four majors			0
" i think it 's a mix of different feelings in @entity3 , " says @entity74 , tournament director of a men 's event in @entity77 and the former national technical director of the @entity79			1
" obviously the expectations were big ... big for a while			0
" when asked if the foursome have lived up to their potential , he replied unequivocally : " no , not yet			0
i really feel like they have n't reached their maximum			0
" and yet , the path of the four might have been completely different			0
@entity90 faced @entity7 in the 2008 @entity54 final , each bidding for a maiden major			2
it was @entity90 who prevailed , and the @entity96 subsequently posted one of the finest campaigns in tennis history in 2011			0
@entity100 and @entity10 share similar , counter-punching styles			2
six years ago , they finished three places apart in the rankings and competed at the year - end championships			0
@entity100 beefed up and has since amassed two grand slam titles			1
pals @entity107 and @entity8 were born 15 days apart in 1986			2
@entity8 has n't appeared in a grand slam final -- and @entity107 boasts 13 majors			1
like @entity111 , @entity9 bagged the @entity113 junior title			2
while @entity111 tallies 17 majors , @entity9 seeks a first semifinal berth at a major outside @entity3			1
" @entity9 was probably the most gifted of the four , " @entity74 told @entity0			2
" @entity8 's mental toughness has been questioned in the past -- something even he is aware of , though he has improved -- and he lacks an overpowering serve			1
since gracing the cover of a @entity3 tennis magazine as an adolescent , @entity8 has rarely escaped the eye of the public			1
" he 's like the baby brother of the country and the people have been babysitting him since he was nine years old , " @entity127 , a tennis writer with @entity3 sports daily @entity128 , told @entity0			1
and they want him to succeed			0
at the same time , sometimes he gets on their nerves			0
" it 's a love - hate relationship but more love than hate			0
" @entity8 , encouragingly , put together his most consistent season in 2013 and made a second appearance at the year - end @entity142			2
@entity7 's all - action game is deemed high risk , with @entity74 adding that the world no. 12 does n't win enough matches when not playing at his best			1
injuries have consistently hampered the 27 - year - old @entity9 , who -- despite often preferring a defensive style -- at times seems more concerned about pleasing fans than winning matches			2
" i think the public still waits for a lot from this generation , " @entity151 , the national technical director of the @entity79 , admitted to @entity0			0
" i think they 're waiting for a @entity37 win and they 're waiting for a grand slam win			1
but we 're never far away			0
" @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 are four of the dozen @entity3 men in the benchmark top 100 , so depth is n't an issue for @entity3 -- the other three grand slam nations of @entity165 , @entity166 and the @entity167 have fewer than 12 players combined in the top 100			1
" we know how to build players and to reach the top 10 , " said @entity74			2
" after the top 10 and inside that , what is making the difference ? not the federation or coach			2
it 's the real wish , investment you put in -- and that 's the individual 's desire			0
" for @entity181 , who runs an academy outside @entity183 and coaches women 's world no. 1 @entity184 , the lack of a grand slam champion comes down to " ambition			1
" " i always say we are a great country to build the players , " @entity181 told @entity0 's @entity189			2
" the thing maybe we do n't have -- there are exceptions -- is the right mentality to raise champions			0
" for the @entity3 players things are too easy for them			1
they make a lot of money in tennis quite early and i think we lack ambition			2
maybe it 's not in the culture of @entity3 to have very high ambitions			1
" grand slam winners are people who have very high expectations , who simply have the mentality of champions			1
i 'm not sure too many @entity3 players have that mentality			1
" @entity151 paused before reacting to @entity181 's comments			0
" is ambition lacking ? " he said			0
" i 'm not sure			0
" today i think @entity7 wants to win a grand slam , @entity8 is showing more ambition , a more demonstrative side on the court with the crowd -- more rage and enthusiasm			1
with age , time passes and you become aware of some things			0
things move on and you realize there are n't many years left			0
" i think all of that will come into play			0
they 're going to have to react and say , ' i do n't want to stop here , not having won a grand slam			1
' " lack of ambition related to the system ? it 's tough to say but it ca n't just be reduced to not getting the results that people want from the players			2
" i think the ambition that we have is to develop a culture of winning			0
but there is also a side that is very personal			0
" @entity8 , twice a grand slam semifinalist , told @entity189 he would " fight " for a first major , and @entity3 's @entity37 captain @entity250 is adamant that one of his charges can break through			1
@entity250 and @entity7 are two of the four @entity3 men to make a grand slam final since @entity46 thrilled the home fans at @entity256 in 1983			1
" it 's going to be tough because tennis is strong in the top 10 , " @entity250 told @entity189			2
" but we saw @entity55 won			0
he worked a lot , he 's smart , and he did it			0
" i am sure it 's possible for all my players , too			0
" the more realistic target , however , might be to capture the @entity37 -- it 's a major goal for @entity8 and the other leading @entity3 players			1
the drought in the competition is n't 31 years but lengthy nonetheless at 13			1
@entity3 is the favorite against @entity268 in the quarterfinals at home this weekend , and @entity3 versus @entity111 's @entity271 is a potential blockbuster final in november			2
" beware of this generation -- they 're not finished , " said @entity151 , who beat a young @entity111 to claim bronze at the @entity274			0
" i do n't think we can draw conclusions			0

@entity3 's tennis federation has long been *praised* for producing players
twelve men sit in the top 100 , tying @entity285 and better than the @entity167
but despite the depth , its men 's grand slam drought extends to 31 years
@entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 do n't look like ending the skid after early promise
