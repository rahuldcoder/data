-- @entity1 and @entity2 disclosed that they received thousands of requests for user data from government agencies in the @entity6 in the last half of 2012			1
@entity1 said it got between 9,000 and 10,000 requests targeting between 18,000 and 19,000 accounts during that period			2
" these requests run the gamut -- from things like a local sheriff trying to find a missing child , to a federal marshal tracking a fugitive , to a police department investigating an assault , to a national security official investigating a terrorist threat , " @entity12 , @entity1 's general counsel , said in a post friday night " with more than 1.1 billion monthly active users worldwide , this means that a tiny fraction of 1 % of our user accounts were the subject of any kind of @entity6 state , local , or federal @entity6 government requests			1
" the disclosure comes amid a firestorm over revelations that both were among companies that turned over user data to the @entity41 's web surveillance program			1
the @entity6 government has a sweeping system for monitoring emails , photos , search histories and other data from major @entity6 internet companies , including @entity1 , @entity2 , @entity49 and @entity50			1
" the @entity52 reached agreements with certain providers that will allow the publication of additional data pertaining to @entity6 government requests for user data in compliance with legal process , " a @entity52 spokesperson told @entity0 saturday			1
" under these agreements , the providers plan to begin publishing aggregate totals of criminal and national security requests received from federal , state , and local governments over a six - month period			0
" more transparency both companies got government permission to publish the reports as long as they were grouped with all others requests , including from state and local agencies			0
the grouping of the data made it hard to single out those made for national security reasons			1
@entity49 publishes a transparency report using requests from governments worldwide			2
it said grouping information is a " step back " for users			1
" we have always believed that it 's important to differentiate between different types of government requests , " @entity49 said in a statement			2
" ... our request to the government is clear : to be able to publish aggregate numbers of national security requests , including @entity93 disclosures , separately			0
" @entity1 said it has been in talks with @entity6 officials to seek greater transparency on national security - related orders			1
in an effort to combat criticism , @entity2 also disclosed information on its data requests friday night			1
" for the six months ended december 31 , 2012 , @entity2 received between 6,000 and 7,000 criminal and national security warrants , subpoenas and orders affecting between 31,000 and 32,000 consumer accounts from @entity6 governmental entities ( including local , state and federal ) , " said @entity103 , @entity2 's vice president			1
the @entity112 index : opinions about the @entity41 leaker both companies said the information they were allowed to publish falls short of what users need to better understand the issues			1
" we are permitted to publish data on national security orders received , but only if aggregated with law enforcement requests from all other @entity6 local , state and federal law enforcement agencies , " @entity103 said			1
the @entity52 spokesperson said , " these aggregate totals include all instances in which a government entity has served lawful process on the providers - be it a grand jury subpoena or search warrant in a criminal matter , a national security letter , a court order under @entity93 , or another type of request pursuant to statutory authorization			0
" the publication of these numbers will show that an extraordinarily small number of accounts are subject to legal process			1
these agreements reflect our continued commitment to working with providers to afford greater transparency to the public while preserving confidentiality required for law enforcement or national security reasons			0
" @entity155 administration officials have pushed back against criticism on the domestic surveillance in the aftermath of the classified leaks last week that disclosed details of covert surveillance programs			1
@entity112 , 29 , has admitted leaking the classified documents about the covert programs			0
top - secret program the top - secret program is legal , conducted properly and could have helped detect a 9/11 hijacker had it been in place before the 2001 terrorist attacks , fbi director @entity165 said thursday			0
civil liberties groups and legislators are among critics condemning the program as government overreach beyond the intention and limits of the @entity176 originally passed in the aftermath of the 2001 attacks			0
" it 's my fear that we are on the verge of becoming a surveillance state , collecting billions of electronic records on law - abiding @entity6 every single day , " said rep. @entity179 of @entity180 , the ranking @entity181 on the judiciary panel			2
@entity179 said he is co-sponsoring legislation that would address " the overbreadth and impenetrability of the surveillance programs			0
" wrong public perception ? but legislators of both parties joined @entity165 in defending the programs			0
" this program does not target innocent @entity6 in any way , shape or form , " said @entity198 speaker @entity197 , an @entity200 @entity199			2
" these programs have helped keep @entity6 safe			2
they have enhanced our ability to go after terrorists who want to bring harm to the @entity6 people			2
" @entity213 sen. @entity212 of @entity214 said public perception of the government data mining was wrong			0
one of the programs , under @entity219 of the @entity176 , collects billions of phone records to create a database for use in tracking suspected terrorists			0
another under @entity225 of the @entity176 deals with computer activity and other information of foreigners			0
@entity0 's @entity229 , @entity230 and @entity231 contributed to this report .			0
