-- what 's @entity2 without palm trees ? that 's a question the island state hopes it wo n't have to answer as it attempts to stave off an invasion by the coconut rhinoceros beetle , an unwanted visitor that 's already done extensive damage on the @entity12 @entity11 territory of @entity13			1
big , hungry and hard to kill , the coconut rhino beetle bores into the tops of coconut palms , eating growing tissues , drinking the sap , ripping into the bases of fronds and exposing the plant to disease			1
then it crawls off to breed , preferably in piles of mulch or trash			0
adults can grow up to two inches long and live to the ripe old age of three months			0
" this beetle is really tough , and most of the pesticides that are legal for use in @entity2 do not work on it , " said @entity30 , the state @entity31 official in charge of containing the beetle			1
the first specimens in @entity2 turned up on a golf course on the military 's @entity42 , outside @entity44 , in december			1
about 500 pheromone - baited traps have been deployed within a one - mile radius of the site ; authorities have urged the public to look out for the beetle and clear away any debris that might make for a beetle 's love nest			2
other alternatives under consideration include possibly releasing a fungus or a virus known to attack the insect in its native habitat in tropical @entity59 , @entity30 said			0
not known how they reached @entity2 the source of the infestation on @entity63 is unclear so far			1
@entity30 said there 's no evidence they stowed away aboard a military ship or plane			0
and since @entity44 's international airport is located just across a highway from the golf course , they might have reached @entity2 via civilian aircraft			2
" what we have found is one major breeding site and a few minor breeding sites , all in close proximity to each other , and we are currently working with the @entity80 and the @entity31 plant protection and quarantine service to deal with the issue , " @entity30 said			2
so far , scientists have found a relatively small population of several thousand			0
an uncontrolled infestation would pose a " tremendous " economic risks to the state , he said			2
" do people want to go to a @entity2 that is without palm trees ? " @entity30 asked			2
the coconut is no longer a cash crop on @entity2 , " but it 's super-important as an ornamental plant			1
" @entity95 still eat its meat , drink its milk and the husks and fibers have a variety of uses in native hawaiian cultural practices			0
and the beetles might not stop at the palms : they could also attack valuable crops and ornamental plants , he said			0
the coconut rhino beetle has been turning up across the @entity110 since the 1940s			1
in 2007 , it reached @entity13 , probably in a shipment of construction material from @entity59 , according to the @entity12 @entity31			1
efforts to wipe them out have been unsuccessful , said @entity116 , a @entity117 entomologist who is advising @entity2 on what has and has n't worked there			1
" eradication is n't impossible , but it 's highly improbable at this time , " @entity116 said			0
" so now we 're trying to learn how to live with it			0
and the same thing will happen in @entity2 if they do n't start doing something right away			1
" " we can expect to lose about 50 % of our coconut palms when it 's all over , and that 's looking really sad , " he said			1
tackling a problem before it blossoms but @entity2 has some advantages that @entity13 did n't -- including plenty of natural beetle predators such as birds			1
most of @entity13 's avian life was wiped out by another invasive species , the brown tree snake , which arrived around 1950			2
birds , rats and mongoose , which were introduced to @entity2 in a 19th century attempt to control rats , are already attacking the rhino beetles , @entity116 said			1
ants and other beetle species may also help by eating the rhino beetle 's larvae			1
and @entity63 is bigger than @entity13 , which is located about 1,500 miles south of @entity148 in the @entity149			2
the smaller the island , the more susceptible to damage from invaders , @entity116 said			0
" they have significant resources that we never had , " he said			0
" the @entity31 's taking this very seriously , and they have a big group of people there			0
" but the one breeding site identified so far on @entity2 is " pumping out adults like crazy			2
" faced with a fast - breeding , invasive menace , @entity2 officials are also discussing whether to resort to more advanced biological control mechanisms			2
growers in countries such as the @entity167 , where coconuts are still a cash crop , use sawdust laced with a fungus that attacks the coconut rhino beetle in traps and breeding sites ; a @entity176 virus that attacks them has been used to control the population in @entity179 and @entity180			1
but neither measure has been approved by @entity12 regulators			0
@entity30 said those steps are being studied in @entity2 , but will require extensive studies under " very contained conditions			1
" then they would have to be approved by both state and federal agencies , which will require their own environmental assessments			0
in the meantime , the battle against the beetles -- a grubby struggle , fought tree - to - tree and mulch heap - to - mulch heap -- will grind on			0
" we will have to be monitoring this project for at least a year , probably more along the lines of three years , " @entity30 said			0

it poses a " tremendous " economic risk to @entity2 if it is n't controlled , official says
