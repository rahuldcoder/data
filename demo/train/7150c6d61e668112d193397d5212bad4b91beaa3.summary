-- radiation from cell phones can possibly cause cancer , according to the @entity4			1
the agency now lists mobile phone use in the same " carcinogenic hazard " category as lead , engine exhaust and chloroform			1
before its announcement tuesday , @entity4 had assured consumers that no adverse health effects had been established			1
a team of 31 scientists from 14 countries , including the @entity18 , made the decision after reviewing peer - reviewed studies on cell phone safety			1
the team found enough evidence to categorize personal exposure as " possibly carcinogenic to humans			0
" what that means is they found some evidence of increase in glioma and acoustic neuroma brain cancer for mobile phone users , but have not been able to draw conclusions for other types of cancers " the biggest problem we have is that we know most environmental factors take several decades of exposure before we really see the consequences , " said dr. @entity37 , chairman of neurology at @entity39 in @entity40			1
the type of radiation coming out of a cell phone is called non-ionizing			1
it is not like an x-ray , but more like a very low - powered microwave oven			0
" what microwave radiation does in most simplistic terms is similar to what happens to food in microwaves , essentially cooking the brain , " @entity37 said			0
" so in addition to leading to a development of cancer and tumors , there could be a whole host of other effects like cognitive memory function , since the memory temporal lobes are where we hold our cell phones			1
" wireless industry responded to tuesday 's announcement saying it " does not mean cell phones cause cancer			1
" @entity75 added that @entity4 researchers " did not conduct any new research , but rather reviewed published studies			1
" the @entity79 has pushed for more studies , saying cell phones could be as big a public health risk as smoking , asbestos and leaded gasoline			2
the head of a prominent cancer - research institute at the @entity88 sent a memo to all employees urging them to limit cell phone use because of a possible risk of cancer			1
" when you look at cancer development -- particularly brain cancer -- it takes a long time to develop			0
i think it is a good idea to give the public some sort of warning that long - term exposure to radiation from your cell phone could possibly cause cancer , " said dr. @entity99 , research professor in bioengineering at @entity100 who has studied radiation for more than 30 years			1
results from the largest international study on cell phones and cancer was released in 2010			0
it showed participants in the study who used a cell phone for 10 years or more had doubled the rate of brain glioma , a type of tumor			1
to date , there have been no long - term studies on the effects of cell phone usage among children			1
" children 's skulls and scalps are thinner			0
so the radiation can penetrate deeper into the brain of children and young adults			0
their cells are at a dividing faster rate , so the impact of radiation can be much larger			0
in february , a study by researchers at the @entity143 , revealed radiation emitted after just 50 minutes on a mobile phone increases the activity in brain cells			2
the effects of brain activity being artificially stimulated are still unknown			0
neurosurgeon and @entity0 chief medical correspondent dr. @entity151 says tuesday 's announcement , " dealt a blow to those who have long said , ' there is no possible mechanism for cell phones to cause cancer			2
' by classifying cell phones as a possible carcinogen , they also seem to be tacitly admitting a mechanism could exist			0
" manufacturers of many popular cell phones already warn consumers to keep their device away from their body and medical experts say there other ways to minimize cell phone radiation			1
the @entity173 safety manual says users ' radiation exposure should not exceed @entity177 guidelines : " when using @entity178 near your body for voice calls or for wireless data transmission over a cellular network , keep @entity178 at least 15 millimeters ( 5/8 inch ) away from the body			0
" @entity185 advises users to " keep the @entity188 device at least 0.98 inch ( 25 millimeters ) from your body when the @entity188 device is transmitting			0
" the logic behind such recommendations is that the further the phone is from the body , the less radiation is absorbed			2
users can also use the speakerphone function or a wired earpiece to gain some distance			0
users can text instead of talk if they want to keep the phone away from their faces			0
finally , cell phones emit the most radiation when they are attempting to connect to cellular towers			2
a moving phone , or a phone in an area with a weak signal , has to work harder , giving of more radiation			2
so users can avoid using their cell phones in elevators , buildings and rural areas if they want to reduce their exposure , experts say .			2

new : experts say there are ways to minimize cell phone radiation
it 's in the same " hazard " category as lead , engine exhaust and chloroform
until now , @entity4 has said no adverse health effects have been established
the cell phone industry maintains that there is no conclusive evidence of danger
