@entity0 -- the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , prompted the @entity3 to take sensible security measures and launch a justified counterattack against @entity6 , says analyst @entity7			1
but he says they also led to an overreaction that continues today			0
@entity7 argues the organization behind the attacks , @entity6 , has been greatly diminished by the @entity3 response to 9/11 and by growing opposition to the group in the @entity16 world : " all these trends have worked to further diminish the threat @entity6 poses to us			1
we 're in a strange situation where the right does n't want to acknowledge it because it would suggest we do n't need to be in quite this much of a war footing and ... the left seems reluctant to accept some of this because it suggests that , @entity26 forbid , @entity20 might have done something right			0
" as a result of our political dysfunction , we have lost the ability to have a rational conversation about 9/11 , " @entity7 said			2
the author and host of @entity1 's " @entity34 " spoke to @entity1 on wednesday			0
here is an edited transcript : @entity1 : is the @entity3 safer today than before 9/11 ? @entity7 : there 's no question we 're safer			1
look , 9/11 changed the way in which we viewed the problem of terrorism and @entity16 radicalism , and we 've gotten attentive to both			2
first of all , there have been huge measures taken -- a series of very simple , sensible measures that decrease the likelihood of anything like 9/11 happening			0
sealing the cockpit door , by itself , means that a plane can never be used as a missile and things like that ... the security measures have made it much more difficult for high - value targets to be vulnerable in quite the way they were			2
the second part is that we have gone after these @entity6 and associated groups quite vigorously , chasing them around the mountains of @entity65 of course but also tracking their money			2
and those things collectively have made a big difference , and there 's no question in my mind , we 're safer			0
now we can begin to ask ourselves whether we have overdone the countermeasures , whether the tens of billions of dollars that have been added year after year to the intelligence budget , to the @entity77 budget have been all necessary or are we on a kind of autopilot where no request for homeland security can ever be denied , and it has become part of the gargantuan pork barrel projects in @entity85			0
@entity1 : you 've written that we 've overreacted to 9/11 and @entity6			2
in what way do you think that 's the case ? @entity7 : i mean it in two senses			2
we did n't spend a lot of time in the year after 9/11 -- once we had taken it on , once we had started chasing these people around the world , measures which i strongly supported then and still strongly support -- whether that had been effective and whether we had broken up the organization and made it far more difficult for them to operate			2
and therefore , what was the real nature of the threat going forward ? i think it 's clear that @entity6 is a much - diminished force			1
it has the power to inspire a series of local organizations around the world , but it has very little power to direct these high - profile terrorist attacks itself			2
the reaction to my point that @entity6 is weaker than we think has surprised me only because i 've made this point since 2004 , and i 've made it repeatedly			0
@entity1 : why do you think many people have not agreed with that point ? @entity7 : i do think we have a tendency in the @entity3 to underestimate the evil intentions of our enemies , but overestimate their capacity , their capabilities			1
what we now know , based on all the declassified documents we have available is that in the 1970s and ' 80s , the @entity3 was massively overestimating the military capacity of the @entity128			0
@entity1 : in what way ? @entity7 : if you look at every measure , from bombers to missiles , on almost every count , we massively overestimated their capacity to modernize , their capacity to build up , and as a result we had created a much , much larger military - industrial complex than would have been necessary to combat the actual @entity128 threat rather than the one we perceived			1
similarly with @entity141 , the intelligence agencies were absolutely convinced that what we faced was a very powerful state that was acquiring nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , which proved to be largely untrue			0
when we look at @entity6 , we have to ask ourselves : what is their actual capacity to inflict harm ? the second sense in which i mean it is i do think there is a tendency within the @entity3 appropriations system for projects to become eternal and eternally expanding and this has clearly become true of homeland security			1
nobody wants to deny the request for more security , more measures , more procedures , all of which come with more budgets , more bureaucrats ... @entity1 : so what should be done now ? @entity7 : this would be the right time for us to take a look and ask ourselves , in order to combat the actual threat that @entity6 poses , which is real but which is limited in some senses -- what kind of intelligence apparatus do we need , what kind of homeland security apparatus do we need and how much can we do in terms in reallocating , reorganizing and reinventing these national security agencies rather than constantly piling up layer upon layer			1
we now have 15 different intelligence agencies , we have 15 different organizations tracking the money that terrorists are moving around			0
it 's almost as though we took the entire @entity191 bureaucracy and rather than scaling it down and reconfiguring it to meet this new set of unconventional threats , we just layered on top of the mountains of @entity191 bureaucracy another set of mountains of terrorism bureaucracy , never mind that the @entity191 is over ... this is not a way to run a serious national security policy			1
and the greatest danger here of course is that unlike the @entity191 , unlike @entity208 , this is not a war that has a clean ending , so you can not set a point at which we would demobilize and therefore get rid of some of this apparatus			0
this is a kind of existential reality that the @entity3 has to deal with , the possibility of terrorism , the possibility of radical groups being able to inflict harm on an open society , so we 've got to ask ourselves is this the normal national security state we want to live with			1
@entity1 : was the concept of a " war on terror " mistaken ? @entity7 : i do n't know if i would quibble with it that much			0
... the problem of course is that terrorism is a tactic , you ca n't declare war against a tactic			0
but in general it conveyed the idea that we needed to go on the offense and we needed to chase these guys around the world , we needed to track their money			0
i have no problem with any of that ... the problem is you can fight a war but you also need to actively gauge the strength of your opponent , and if you think he 's 25 feet tall vs. five feet tall , that 's important			0
that 's a huge misdiagnosis of the problem ... @entity1 : why do you think people have missed the change in @entity6 's capabilities ? @entity7 : we 're not looking at trends within the @entity16 world where @entity6 has been politically discredited , trends that are taking place within the jihadi community , where prominent jihadis have broken with @entity6			1
the reality is that @entity6 has been unable to organize a single attack [ against a major target in recent years ] , the reality is that when smaller local groups plan terrorist attacks all they can attack are local targets like cafes or train stations and thus kill locals , further alienating the local population and discrediting and delegitimizing @entity6 and its associated groups			1
@entity1 : nine years after 9/11 , why is the debate about @entity16 and terrorism fiercer than it 's ever been ? @entity7 : what 's more strange is that it feels as though it 's a debate that 's taking place without the intervening nine years			1
sometimes the debate seems as though it could have been taking place in 2002 , without noticing all these trends that i 've been describing			0
@entity281 was a wake - up call for @entity3 , but it also was a wake - up call for a lot of people in the @entity16 world			1
in the early months after 9/11 , and i wrote about this at the time , there was a sense in the @entity16 world that while they might not have approved of the attacks , they understood the anti-americanism that lay behind it			1
that kind of totally irresponsible and pernicious implicit support for @entity16 radicalism has worn very thin in the last nine years			2
@entity1 : why has radicalism lost support ? @entity7 : people who felt that way in @entity304 , in @entity305 , even in @entity306 have realized that these guys [ @entity6 ] are as opposed to the secular regimes of @entity304 , @entity305 and in the @entity309 as they are to the @entity3 and when they attack @entity304 and @entity305 , they kill innocent @entity304 and @entity305 , innocent @entity16 by the way			1
that reality has also produced a kind of rethinking about @entity16 extremism that has been very important			0
i should emphasize that it is not enough and there needs to be more persistent condemnation of radicalism and violence but there 's no question , and the polling data make this clear , the number of fatwas issued against @entity6 and @entity326 make this clear -- there has been a huge shift in the @entity16 world over the last nine years			1
@entity1 : finally , @entity329 is reaffirming his plans to proceed with @entity331 , the controversial @entity16 center near ground zero			0
what do you think of that ? @entity7 : this is to be a community center that will have a swimming pool , meeting rooms , athletic facilities , modeled after the 92nd @entity342 it will have @entity343 and @entity344 and @entity16 on its board , it will have prayer rooms for @entity343 and @entity344 as well as @entity16			1
it will have both physical spaces and programs to encourage interfaith dialogue			0
now to me that sounds like precisely the @entity3 answer to @entity16 radicalism , to affirm a @entity16 - led process of interfaith dialogue , of tolerance for other religions ... the plan here is to build a center that is really trying to bring people together , this is such an @entity3 response to intolerance , extremism and violence			1
it is about inclusion , dialogue and respect for other faiths .			0

@entity281 led @entity3 to strike back at @entity6 and take smart measures , says @entity7
he says in the years after attacks , @entity3 has overestimated threat from @entity6
he says group is on the run and *widely* discredited in the @entity16 world
@entity7 : @entity3 needs to scale its security policies and bureaucracy to the actual threat
