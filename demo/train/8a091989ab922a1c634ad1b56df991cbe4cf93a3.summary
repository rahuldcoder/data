@entity1 , @entity0 -- the attorney for one of two teenagers charged with rape in a case that has consumed a small @entity0 town wants a judge to postpone and move his client 's trial , he said sunday			1
@entity13 , the lawyer for 16 - year - old defendant @entity14 , told @entity2 he wants the case moved out of @entity1 because of the extensive publicity it has received " and what we perceive as threats to individuals , perhaps witnesses , and also defendants and even defense counsel			1
" @entity13 would not elaborate on those threats but said media attention and an explosion of online postings about the case are another part of the reason he 'll be filing motions for a postponement and a change of venue			2
" we 're concerned about safety issues at this point , " he added			1
@entity14 and co-defendant @entity37 , also 16 , are charged with raping a teenage girl during late - night partying and drinking in august			2
both teens are scheduled to be tried february 13 in a juvenile court in @entity1 , in eastern @entity0 near the @entity43 state line			1
@entity45 's lawyer , @entity44 , told @entity2 he also plans to file a motion for change of venue " and another motion that will probably necessitate a hearing			1
" he declined to elaborate			0
a judge from @entity52 is hearing the case after a local judge recused himself to avoid an appearance of conflict , and the local district attorney asked @entity0 attorney general @entity59 's office to handle the prosecution			1
@entity62 spokesman @entity61 did not directly address @entity13 's concerns sunday			1
" the investigation is ongoing , and it includes all aspects of the case , including evidence put out in social media , " @entity64 said			0
" so the investigation is still ongoing at this time			0
we 'll review any motions they file			0
" trials are often granted a change of venue because of the fear of a tainted jury pool			0
but in this case , a judge will determine the teens ' fate			1
police chief @entity82 said many people in town know someone who may have a connection to the case			0
@entity2 is not identifying the girl , a juvenile , in accordance with its policy not to release the names of alleged rape victims			0
although the suspects also are juveniles , @entity2 is identifying them because they have been publicly named by a juvenile court judge , by defense attorneys and in media accounts			0
special prosecutor @entity96 told a judge at a probable cause hearing last october that the girl " was unresponsive , not in a position of consent , and they knew about it , and let 's be clear , they knew she was drunk			0
" lawyers for both defendants have said their clients are not guilty			1
" we deny the accusations completely			1
we deny the lack of consent			1
we deny that there was sexual activity			1
we deny that there was a rape			2
and we steadfastly maintain that , " @entity13 said			0
@entity44 said his client has denied the charge in court			2
the attorney has complained that @entity45 's presumption of innocence has been destroyed by the publicity surrounding the case			0
" our emotional response is he 's a juvenile , and it 's life - altering -- and that was before it became the focus of international media attention , " @entity44 said , adding , " all i want is justice			0
" the case gained national attention after the @entity133 published a lengthy piece on it in december and when the activist hacker group @entity135 posted a previously unpublicized video of teenagers cracking jokes about the case			0
@entity13 said his motions will be filed under seal , but he plans to tell the judge that his case may be hamstrung by hesitant witnesses			0
some potential witnesses who attended the parties where the alleged sexual assaults occurred are refusing to talk with his defense team , the lawyer said			2
" i 'm concerned about whether or not the case should be tried in this area , " @entity13 said			2
" perhaps the fact that it is in the @entity1 area is going to prohibit certain people from wanting to come forward and testify			1
