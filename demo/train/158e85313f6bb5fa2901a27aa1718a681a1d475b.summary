@entity0 -- president @entity2 honored @entity3 with a @entity5 reception monday where he likened the struggle for gay rights with the struggle of african - americans for civil rights			1
president @entity2 and first lady @entity11 entertain monday in the @entity5 's @entity12			1
with first lady @entity11 at his side , the president told the cheering crowd filling the @entity12 that his administration would work to repeal the so - called @entity16 and end the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy regarding gays in the military			1
" i know that many in this room do n't believe that progress has come fast enough , and i understand that , " @entity2 said			1
" it 's not for me to tell you to be patient any more than it was for others to counsel patience to african - americans who were petitioning for equal rights a half - century ago			2
" the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy bars military officials from asking about a service member 's sexual orientation but also bars the service member from revealing it , and allows the dismissal of a service member if a same - sex orientation is discovered			0
" i believe preventing patriotic @entity29 from serving their country weakens our national security , " @entity2 said to applause			1
ending the policy requires an act of @entity46 and will take time , he added			0
the @entity16 effectively bars the federal government from recognizing same - sex unions , even as individual states legalize them			0
it is one of the most divisive political issues in @entity29 , strongly backed by conservatives -- particularly the religious right			0
" we have a duty to uphold existing law , but i believe we must do so in a way that does not exacerbate old divides , " @entity2 said			2
" and fulfilling this duty in upholding the law in no way lessens my commitment to reversing this law			0
" he also is pushing for passage of a law guaranteeing full benefits including health care for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender couples and their children , as well as bills to strengthen laws against hate crimes and prevent employment discrimination based on sexuality , @entity2 said			1
" there are unjust laws to overturn and unfair practices to stop , " he said			0
" and though we 've made progress , there are still fellow citizens -- perhaps neighbors or even family members and loved ones -- who still hold fast to worn arguments and old attitudes , who fail to see your families like their families and who would deny you the rights that most @entity29 take for granted			0
and i know this is painful , and i know it can be heartbreaking			2
" @entity2 cited the roots of the gay rights struggle in the @entity100 riot 40 years ago , when police raided a @entity103 nightclub and sparked a demonstration that lasted for days			1
" as we 've seen so many times in history , once that spirit takes hold , there 's little that can stand in its way , " he said to cheers that turned to laughs when he added : " the truth is , when these folks protested at @entity100 40 years ago , no one could have imagined that you or , for that matter , i would be standing here today			0
