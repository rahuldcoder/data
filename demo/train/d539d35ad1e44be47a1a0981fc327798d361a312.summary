@entity0 -- @entity2 , one of seven emirates which make up the @entity4 , is putting new meaning into the saying " build it and they will come			1
" as members of @entity10 tussle with a 20 % drop in oil prices since june -- and question if they should trim production at their november meeting -- the @entity4 is forging ahead with a crucial piece of its energy strategy			1
sitting south of the world 's busiest oil shipping lane , the @entity19 , the tiny emirate of @entity2 is emerging as a global energy hub			1
@entity23 , general manager of the @entity24 , saw the area 's potential in 1991 , during the first @entity27			2
a traffic jam of more than 200 tankers , triggered by concerns of bomb attacks , was lined up at the mouth of the @entity19			2
@entity23 told @entity1 this was a " light bulb moment " for his team			0
" we thought we should be thinking about how we can serve shipping as maritime services , " he said , referencing the bunkering service initially offered			0
today , the once sleepy emirate is doing far more than just loading fuel for ships			0
after @entity43 threatened to shut down the @entity19 in 2008 , oil - rich @entity0 decided to leverage @entity2 's strategic location on the @entity45 with unimpeded access to the seas to reach clients in @entity49			1
@entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 are @entity0 's top three importers of @entity4 crude			1
the game changer was a decision by the @entity4 government to build a $ 3 billion , 240 - mile oil pipeline from @entity0 's @entity60 field into @entity2 , with a capacity of 1.5 million barrels a day			1
the pipeline , opened two years ago , can handle about half of the @entity4 's daily production			1
@entity65 , a 30 - year veteran of the business and executive director of @entity68 , laid out the energy hub 's potential while taking me through a map of the facility			1
@entity65 said @entity2 has something those in @entity49 and @entity76 do n't : plenty of oil in its neighborhood			1
" unlike @entity81 or @entity82 , which are the leading ports , you are surrounded by crude producers , surrounded by refineries , " said @entity65			2
" this is what interested us the most , and it 's very peaceful			0
" indeed , it is almost eerily peaceful			0
on a clear day , looking east from the balcony , one can see @entity43			0
with rising demand from @entity49 , and two thirds of proven reserves sitting in the region , the @entity4 will continue to up the ante with more spending			2
by june 2016 , the port is expected to be able to manage huge crude carriers known in the business as " @entity101 , " which handle two million barrels per load			1
future plans include building a lng import terminal to use natural gas to fuel power plants , saving the oil for export			0
@entity109 , commercial director of @entity110 , told me those investments are ensuring the expanding terminal is catching the attention of the energy industry			2
he points to , for example , the joint venture he is helping launch in december with @entity50 's @entity119 and @entity81 's @entity120			0
" all these things , add them up and it gives you a perfect scenario for somebody to take a step forward and get out of the usual thing and do something different , " @entity109 told me as we toured the construction of the site 's massive holding tanks			0
in an irony not lost on the executives , it was threats by @entity43 in 2008 which triggered this investment			0
if talks with @entity141 over its nuclear program go well and sanctions are lifted , this expanding hub could eventually welcome @entity43 crude			2
more from @entity146 : @entity148 ' struggle to control its oil riches read more : airstrikes , militants and a refugee crisis fail to dampen @entity154 oil markets			0
