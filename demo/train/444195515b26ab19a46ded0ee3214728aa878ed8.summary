in the shadow of the iphone 5 reveal , @entity0 rolled out updates to its most enduring mobile product , the @entity4 , on wednesday			1
they include a bigger , yet lighter and thinner , @entity6 that mirrors the stretched - out new @entity7 and a bigger screen on the tiny @entity9			1
the new @entity6 is 6.1 millimeters thick , making it the thinnest touch yet , and weighs in at a dainty 3.1 ounces			1
@entity11 , @entity0 's voice - activated " digital assistant , " is also making her way to the @entity6 , and that 's not the only way @entity0 's premier @entity4 , which some already called an iphone without the phone , is getting closer to its smartphone cousin			1
in addition to the same screen update , it will run @entity0 's latest operating system , @entity24 6			1
it will have the same processor as the @entity26 and it adds a 5 - megapixel rear - facing camera , featuring auto - focus and a flash			0
the @entity31 got more svelte as well			0
it 's down to 5 millimeters thick , which makes it the thinnest @entity4 yet			2
but it 's also getting a bigger , 2.5 - inch touchscreen display			1
favored for exercise , the @entity31 will come with fitness features like a built - in pedometer and support for @entity41 +			0
it also has an fm radio feature that allows users to pause and resume music			0
like the @entity7 , both new @entity4 will come with new , smaller inputs , but , unlike the phone , they wo n't come equipped with an adapter that will let users convert their old @entity0 cords			1
along with the new @entity4 comes an advance in how folks will listen to them			2
after coining the term " earbuds , " @entity0 has moved on and showed off @entity55 on wednesday			1
they 're round , unlike the flatter earbud , and have two grills for sound in each one			0
they 'll come with the new @entity6 , @entity31 and @entity7 and be sold separately for $ 29			1
pre-orders for the @entity6 begin friday			2

in recent years , ipods have been largely overshadowed as smartphones and tablets emerged as the mobile tech of choice			2
but they 've been massive for @entity0 , selling more than 350 million units since being introduced in 2001 , when they were credited with helping a flailing @entity0 launch an epic turnaround			2
they quietly remain relevant , developers say			0
" the @entity6 is an underappreciated part of the @entity0 ecosystem -- particularly for the youth and education markets , " said @entity87 , ceo of outdoor - lifestyle app @entity88			1
@entity93 , the co-creator of popular @entity24 game " @entity94 , " said wednesday that more than 50 % of the game 's player base uses an @entity6			1
" a large group of users still use the second - generation @entity6 , which was holding back our implementation of new features , " he said			2
" i believe that these users were not upgrading the new hardware because there has n't been a substantial @entity6 iteration until now			0
with the larger screen , new design and assortment of colors , i think we 're going to see a very large adoption of the new hardware			0
