-- an eclectic group of engineers , designers , artists , parents and lactation consultants came together at @entity7 over the weekend to improve a necessary , unpopular device : the breast pump			1
" they are loud , they are painful , they are very expensive , they can cause pain and tissue damage , and they are weird , " said @entity10 , a research affiliate at the @entity7 and mother of three			1
together with a group of other @entity24 researchers and students , @entity21 helped host a " @entity28 " hackathon in @entity27			1
the 120 participants broke into 18 teams			1
they tinkered with old pumps and materials , consulted with volunteer experts and low - income working moms and came up with prototypes for what they hope will be the next generation of breast pumps			1
the winning team designed a pump for people who are n't able to take breaks to pump breast milk			1
pumping while working means stopping all activity and heading to a secluded room for half an hour , multiple times a day			2
that loss of productivity is bad for employers and employees , and it can be difficult to do with active jobs such as nursing			2
the @entity55 utility belt turned a pump into a hands - free portable device that is worn discreetly under clothes and can work while the wearer goes about her regular routine			1
many of the teams saw potential in wearable sensors and data			0
the @entity69 design used a smartphone and sensors to log data such as pumping times and amounts			0
a mother could share the information with her doctor , a lactation support consultant or a larger community of other pumping mothers to troubleshoot any issues			0
a handful of teams focused on mimicking the natural feel of breastfeeding a baby instead of the vacuum technology used by current pumps			0
a hands - free compression bra used small bladders that fill up to massage and compress the breast , drawing the milk out			2
another used technology similar to blood pressure cuffs			0
a soft baby sling with little ears on it doubles as a holder for a pump , mimicking the feel , look and weight of carrying a child			2
the technology already exists to fix many of the biggest issues with breast pump technology , such as loud motors and bulky , weak batteries			1
" there really is low - hanging fruit here , " said @entity10			0
to make the leap from cool idea to actual product , the hackathon teams need to attract funding or the interest of a major pump manufacturer			1
luckily , the event drew executives from major maternal health companies , including @entity119 and @entity120			0
and the winning team gets to pitch its idea to @entity124 investors			0
the group started as an idea for an art project : to make a wonderful breast pump that everyone wanted to wear			1
then @entity130 , @entity21 and @entity131 realized the idea was n't so crazy after all			0
spurred on by a piece in the @entity136 ' motherlode blog , they got a @entity137 the @entity139 group together and decided to do something about it			0
the first " make the @entity143 " hackathon took place in may and included about 20 people			1
over 1,000 people wrote in with their own problems , ideas and fixes on the group 's facebook page			2
some had specific issues , such as breast cancer survivors who wanted to breastfeed			2
parents also shared their own fixes and solutions			2
as it turns out , moms have been hacking their own pumps for ages			0
some knit cozies to muffle the loud noise the pump makes , others have created custom flanges to fit their unique shapes			1
instead of just encouraging manufacturers to improve their designs , the @entity170 group is making some hacks publicly available			0
they 'll publish 3d files online so anyone with access to a 3d printer can print custom accessories and parts that work with existing pumps .			0

120 people participated in a " make the @entity185 " hackathon at @entity7
the engineers , designers and parents created new takes on the breast pump
the winner was a pump on a utility belt that could be worn under clothes
