-- trying to find a cheap place to crash in @entity2 ? for most people , that 's impossible			1
but @entity5 is not like most people			2
the recent high school graduate scored a spot in @entity9 's first imagine @entity11 cohort , an initiative aimed at supporting entrepreneurship in the educational field			1
his dream was to create software to tap the vast potential of the @entity18 and facilitate collaborative learning among students and teachers , one of several such innovative efforts the technology company hoped to help bring to life			0
thus the then - 19 - year - old put off college , left his @entity28 home and headed west last year to work out of @entity9 's @entity29 , @entity30 , office			1
there , he continued working on his product and made the most of his new work digs -- heading to the office 's gym each morning to work out and shower , then snacking over the course of the day on ramen noodles , trail mix and leftovers from meetings			1
he used his limited venture capital funds to pay his rent and assorted other bills			1
until , that is , that money ran out			0
" i tried to sleep on my friends ' couches , but they were full for the next month or so , " @entity5 told @entity0 on monday , explaining what he did after losing his apartment			2
" so i just ended up sleeping on their couches			0
" by " their couches , " he meant the furniture he could find in the @entity30 offices of @entity9 , which was once but is no longer a sister company of @entity0			0
@entity5 evaded security for two months -- not to mention having to pay for an apartment , gym membership and more			1
he said that he spent a total of $ 30 over those weeks , splurging at @entity63 for his @entity65 feast but otherwise subsisting largely by " eating scraps			0
" " i was n't paying for rent , i was n't paying for water , ( and ) most of my food was provided by other companies leaving leftovers , " @entity5 recalled			1
he knew that squatting in a corporate office " is certainly frowned upon			0
" but @entity5 insisted it was the course he had to take if he really wanted to get his venture , @entity75 , off the ground			2
" if i did n't do that , we would n't have been able to build this product , ( and ) we would n't have been able to launch it and get the large amount of traction that we did , " he said			2
today , @entity75 is up and running and close to securing $ 500,000 more in funding , on top of an earlier $ 50,000 , according to @entity5			0
@entity9 has n't talked to him directly about the couch - surfing that helped make the dream a reality			2
but @entity9 senior vice president , @entity88 , released a statement about @entity91 's situation , saying , " it was always our intention to facilitate entrepreneurialism in the @entity29 office -- we just did n't expect it to work so well			1
" @entity5 , now 20 , admits that mooching and living round - the - clock at @entity9 's offices was " certainly a gray area " legally			1
but he now casts this experience as a positive when pitching @entity75 to potential investors			0
" if you were to invest in a company , would you invest in someone that closed up shop and went home ? " he said			0
" or would you invest in a person that , kind of against all odds , ... figured out a way to pull everything together when everything was stacked against him ? "			0

@entity5 was chosen to be part of an @entity9 *program* to *foster* entrepreneurship
his venture capital funds ran out while he was working from @entity9 's @entity2 office
@entity5 spent the next two months sleeping , eating and showering at the office
" if i did n't do that , we would n't have been able to build " his product , he says
