-- @entity2 @entity1 was thrust into the national spotlight on two hot - button issues this week			1
it had nothing to do with the cases involved -- same - sex marriage in @entity9 and a requirement for contraceptive coverage under @entity12			2
the two emergency appeals on @entity14 came her way because the cases originated in western areas of the country -- @entity19 and @entity9 -- that fall under her jurisdiction for reviewing time - sensitive federal motions			0
@entity1 sought more information on an appeal from @entity9 to uphold its voter - approved ban on same - sex unions in the state			1
but she made headlines on the politically charged case around the @entity12 just as new rules were about to take effect			1
@entity1 issued an order that , for the moment , stayed a requirement under the sweeping health law for certain religiously affiliated groups to ensure that employees receive coverage for contraception at no cost			1
the @entity44 - based organization that cares for elderly poor , the @entity42 , objects to complying with rules under the law that would guarantee it an exemption but , in theory , still require a third party to provide contraception insurance			2
ultimately , it believes authorizing a form that passes the ball to another entity still means contraception coverage for its employees and that , to the nuns , is objectionable on moral grounds			0
the @entity60 opposes artificial contraception			0
while @entity1 's emergency injunction or any follow up to extend it or seek the opinion of her fellow justices for additional review may seem like a blow to the politically charged health care law , it is n't			1
nor does it convey any meaning about where @entity1 , a liberal jurist , may stand on the larger issues raised in the appeal overall			1
" she just placed a single case on hold			1
she did not overturn @entity12 , " @entity0 legal analyst @entity76 said			1
her decision late on tuesday simply put the brakes on compliance for the @entity42 and enabled the @entity81 administration to file its arguments			0
the @entity83 said on friday the appeal lacked merit			0
the charity , it said , is eligible for an exemption and moreover , the entity that administers its insurance plans , the non-profit @entity91 , is also exempt under certain conditions in the @entity12 rules applying to religious institutions			0
@entity76 said @entity1 acted " based on her view of the law " in holding up the rule in this case			2
@entity1 voted to uphold @entity100 in 2012 in a blockbuster @entity2 ruling that gave @entity81 an enormous political victory			0
@entity12 seeks to extend health coverage to millions of @entity105 without it and is the president 's signature domestic achievement			2
it is relentlessly under attack from conservatives who have made numerous attempts to repeal or otherwise sink it , and is the focus of numerous legal challenges .			0

@entity1 upheld @entity12 last year , now she 's in the spotlight again in another appeal
she issued stay to give @entity44 nuns *reprieve* on providing birth control to *workers*
" she just placed a single case on hold . she did not overturn @entity12 , " analyst says
@entity1 got the case because the nuns live in @entity44 , a town in her " region "
