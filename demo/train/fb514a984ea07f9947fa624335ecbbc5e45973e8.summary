all the elements for a grand love affair with @entity2 are there : the adorable pixie cut , the large , luminous dark eyes , the successful career that literally began with a fairy tale			1
she kind of bugs you , does n't she ? @entity11 " @entity2 " and " hate , " and the evidence is overwhelming			1
link after link highlights the great @entity16 pastime ( though it may actually be international , but more on that later ) of being annoyed by the @entity20 - winning actress			1
it 's clear from the abundance of articles and negative comments that some people do n't even want to see her face			0
according to one academic , there may be a scientific reason why			0
" when times are good we prefer actresses with rounder faces , " psychology professor @entity31 told @entity37 writer @entity36 in a piece titled " @entity2 : @entity40 's most polarizing star			1
" " they convey these ideas of fun and youth			0
" @entity45 concluded that @entity2 has a " mature face " made distinctive by its slender shape and bone structure : " it suggests she would be popular when times are more challenging			1
" @entity37 goes on , " as the economy improves , @entity2 -- whose peak of fame , post-boyfriend , pre-oscar - hosting , came amid the 2008 economic crash -- may just be a reminder of bad times			1
" try and find a correlation between dislike of any other actress and the recession			2
such high - brow hatred is usually reserved for the elite , say a @entity67 , but @entity2 currently reigns supreme as the star so many love to hate			1
in a deep , visceral way that makes it hard even to pinpoint why			0
" people do not like @entity2 , " wrote @entity72 of @entity73			1
" they use the word ' hate ' a lot when they talk about her			0
and their hatred is vehement , like @entity80 's for @entity80 , like the @entity81 ' for the @entity82 , and @entity86 's for every man who she has ever talked to since her 15th birthday			2
" apparently this really holds true for women of the universe			0
even in the midst of @entity92 tweeting a vulgar term during the @entity20 about 9 - year - old best actress nominee @entity94 , there was still time to bash @entity2			1
" and what the @entity92 missed is that it 's @entity2 who 's the real ( expletive )			1
right every woman on the internet ? " tweeted @entity98 's @entity97			0
so what 's the deal ? why so much hate for an actress who defined cute in " @entity105 " and held her own against @entity106 in " @entity107 " ? @entity108 of @entity109 told @entity73 's @entity72 that @entity2 has " got this theater kid thing where she adopts the mood of every situation she 's in -- rude and bawdy on ' @entity114 , ' poised and ' classy ' at the @entity20 , etc. -- but wildly overcompensates every time			1
" @entity108 continued , " she always seems like she 's performing , and her favorite act is this overstated humility and graciousness			2
" writer @entity119 is one half of the @entity121 , a site that helps clients craft speeches			2
part of @entity2 's problem , @entity119 said , is that the actress is " just one of the people who just does n't come off as sincere			1
" take for example her award show acceptance speeches			0
the whole point of awards shows is that no one knows who is going to win and the audience counts on that element of surprise to be part of a winner 's speech , @entity119 says			0
but @entity2 's words of gratitude come off as way too rehearsed			1
" the more you rehearse something , the more kind of presumptuous it comes across , " @entity119 said			0
" we are used to seeing actors act , but we want to see a glimpse of their personality			0
with @entity2 , the @entity153 speech came off as rehearsed word for word			1
" and the disdain is n't confined to just these shores			0
when @entity2 won the @entity159 , or @entity160 , award this year for best supporting actress for her role as fantine in " @entity164 , " her acceptance speech did not go over well			1
" @entity2 annoyed audiences by thanking everyone remotely connected with ' @entity164 , ' even the author of the original novel @entity170 , " reported @entity165			1
" one snide remark on @entity172 said : ' if @entity2 thanked @entity170 , will ( director @entity174 ) @entity173 have to thank @entity175 ? ' " not that @entity2 does n't have her supporters			1
reacting to all of the negative @entity2 buzz , " girls " star @entity177 implored her @entity172 followers to think of the greater good			2
" ladies : @entity2 is a feminist and she has amazing teeth			2
let 's save our bad attitudes for the ones who are n't advancing the cause , " @entity177 tweeted			0
the actress is not oblivious to the shade being thrown her way			0
after her @entity20 win for best supporting actress sunday night , she was asked backstage her reaction to being teased about her earnestness			2
" it does get to me , but you have to remember in life that there 's a positive to every negative and a negative to every positive , " @entity2 responded			2
" and i 'm going to ... i 'm going to go there			0
the miracle of the universe is that , as far as they know , there 's 51 % matter versus 49 % antimatter			0
things tip in the scale of the positive			0
and so , that is what i focus on			0

hating @entity2 has become a favorite pastime for many
one writer says the dislike for the @entity20 winner is " vehement "
