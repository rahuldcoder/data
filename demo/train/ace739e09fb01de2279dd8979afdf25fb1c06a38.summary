-- @entity2 's plan to guarantee its economic future depends on empowering and enriching the most downtrodden of its citizens : migrant workers			1
these are the approximately 250 million people from the countryside that now live and work in @entity11 cities but they can not access government healthcare , education and other social services once they leave their home villages and towns			0
these migrants are handcuffed by the @entity19 - inspired " hukou " system of housing registration			2
introduced in the 1950s , it aimed to prevent farmers and peasants from flooding into the cities and during the @entity27 years such a move was nearly impossible			0
since reforms began in 1980 , however , the government has allowed farmers to migrate to the cities to fill jobs at factories , construction sites , restaurants , hotels , shopping centers and the like			0
this population of migrant workers is now estimated to consititute as much as 25 % of the residents of major @entity11 cities today			1
just over 50 % of @entity2 's 1.3 billion people now live in cities , as compared to some 20 % when reforms began in 1980			1
the @entity44 hit the 50 % mark in 1920			0
@entity46 became majority urban in 1850			0
@entity2 's future growth depends on " hukou " reform to make these people legal urban residents and turn them into the next wave of consumers the reason is that the current economic model is running out of gas			1
the model -- based on state enterprises and driven by loose credit and government spending on infrastructure -- must be transformed into an economy driven by consumers			1
when the new @entity67 leadership of president @entity68 and premier @entity69 came into office a year ago , consumption was only about 35 % of @entity71 , as compared to 54 % in @entity72 and nearly 75 % in the @entity44 the existing urban population -- with legal housing registration -- mostly have done well in the past couple of decades			2
many have already splurged on apartments , cars and large electronics			0
they alone ca n't drive the level of consumption the @entity11 economy will require going forward			0
the " @entity2 " report published by the @entity84 and the @entity85 , a @entity11 think tank that advises the leadership , said that if @entity2 can provide legal urban housing registration for 10 million migrant workers a year and transform them into the next wave of consumers , then @entity2 can enjoy 6 % annual growth for the next couple of decades			1
this @entity84 report also estimates that @entity2 will have from 13 million to 15 million people per year moving from the countryside to cities for the next couple of decades			2
a huge challenge for @entity2 's leadership is developing a sustainable urban development model			1
for the past 20 years , city planning and urbanization has been driven by real estate sales that funded city governments and enriched well - connected property developers			0
the government owns all the land in @entity2 and only property usage rights change hands			2
so city planners have focused on turning rural land into urban land so it could be developed			0
all too often this was done by constructing ring roads around cities to delineate ever larger areas for development			0
a serious consequence of this model is heavy pollution , tangled traffic and urban designs that favor massive developments instead of housing , workplaces , education and recreation facilities that are organized around how people live and work and socialize			2
demographers and planners in @entity2 are now debating the best models for future development			1
these include encircling @entity2 's existing metropolises with satellite cities in a hub - and - spoke pattern that would allow migrants to live an hour away with legal housing registration			1
the government 's current five - year plan designates 20 such centers of urbanization			1
this includes the five cities that have the same status as @entity2 's provinces -- @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 -- as well as such " regional centers " as @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158			1
in the @entity159 inland from @entity160 , @entity2 plans to spend $ 350 billion to mesh together nine cities with a population of 50 million			0
the views expressed in this article are solely those of @entity165			0

@entity2 's economic future depends on empowering migrant workers
the current *investment* - based economic model is running out of gas
making migrants legal urban residents will create a new wave of consumers
however , sustainable urban development will be huge challenge
