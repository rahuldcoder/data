-- @entity2 " fell short " several times in treating @entity5 patient @entity4 , starting by not asking the right questions in the emergency room , the hospital 's chief clinical officer , dr. @entity10 , said in an interview with @entity0			1
on september 25 , @entity4 came into the @entity11 with a fever and was interviewed by a nurse who wrote down that he " came from @entity14 9 - 20 - 14 , " @entity10 said			2
the nurse did n't specify which nation , he said			0
around the same time a physician recorded @entity4 as " a local resident , no contact with sick people			2
no symptoms of nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , " @entity10 said			0
@entity4 , a 42 - year - old @entity24 native , was let go four hours later			2
he returned to the hospital a few days later and on october 8 became the first person to die of @entity5 in the @entity27			1
new questions in the emergency room @entity10 said the hospital has updated its admitting policy and that @entity11 workers ask whether patients have traveled to five specific countries in @entity14			1
" we were completely prepared to take care of someone who came in with a diagnosis of @entity5 , " @entity10 said			1
" the place where we fell short was being able to diagnose a patient walking in off the street with symptoms that could be consistent with @entity5 or anything else and really being able to manage that			0
" after @entity4 died and two nurses who cared for him contracted @entity5 , the @entity45 issued new guidelines monday on how health care workers should handle @entity5 cases			1
the @entity45 director stressed that hospitals train workers more thoroughly and make sure no skin is exposed when dealing with @entity5 patients			0
@entity10 told @entity0 the hospital did n't conduct enough training in how to handle @entity5 patients -- something that contributed to the initial misdiagnosis			1
" where we fell short was in really going through simulation and training and drilling around what might happen if someone with appropriate ( symptoms ) , appropriate history showed up to the @entity67 and raised a suspicion of @entity5 , " he said			0
complete coverage on @entity5 two nurses were n't told not to travel @entity10 was asked if any nurses raised concerns about having to treat an @entity5 patient			1
he replied , " not to my knowledge			0
" yet several days ago nurses at the hospital complained about lack of safety protocols at the hospital , such as having protective gear that left their necks uncovered			2
@entity10 said the hospital did n't issue no - travel mandates to two nurses who treated @entity4 and later developed @entity5			1
one of them flew on commercial flights			0
" our job was to identify the folks who were the contacts of mr. @entity4 and travel policy and all that other sort of stuff was largely dictated by county , state and the @entity45 , " @entity10 said			0
he said the policy has been changed so that hospital workers who might contract @entity5 are told not to take public transportation			2
@entity4 's family has criticized the hospital , saying they do n't think he had to die			1
@entity10 said he does n't know if that 's true			0
" i do n't think you can prognosticate about whether there would have been a change in outcome , " he said			0
" we are certainly forthcoming and transparent about the fact that we missed a diagnosis on the 25th and 26th , and we 've said over again that that 's something that we deeply regret and wish we could have hit the diagnosis right then			1
" travelers from @entity14 restricted to five @entity27 airports			0
