@entity0 -- to break out beyond the personal computer market in the @entity4 , @entity2 will need a little help from its friends			1
@entity2 has operated as a lone wolf in @entity8 , where the company is based , by building hardware that runs its uniquely designed software			1
at the @entity12 show this week , @entity2 launched a cloud service in @entity8 , similar to @entity15 's @entity14 , that will keep all of its devices in sync			1
the company will take a different approach , however , when it expands in the @entity4 , @entity2 ceo @entity18 said in an interview here			1
" we can not do everything by ourselves , " @entity18 said			0
the @entity4 market is " more challenging than in @entity8 because we have to rely on somebody else 's ecosystem			2
so we have to find the right partner here			0
" @entity2 expects to continue using @entity30 's @entity29 on its computers , and @entity33 's android on its tablets and smartphones , @entity18 said			0
@entity36 and @entity30 may try to court the @entity8 electronics giant to help with its @entity4 mobile efforts , however			1
in the @entity4 , @entity2 is barely a top - five @entity40 manufacturer , but it 's a solid no. 2 globally			2
its trio of tablets , which are all based on @entity32 , have n't sold particularly well in the @entity4			2
@entity2 has grown significantly in the @entity4 in the last few years thanks to its aggressive pricing and the 2005 acquisition of @entity47 ' pc division , which has catapulted @entity2 's sales to corporations			2
@entity4 retailers have suggested that @entity2 should price its computers $ 50 below competitors ' comparable systems , advice the company has heeded because it has n't achieved a strong brand in @entity4 , @entity18 said			1
pinching pennies delays the @entity4 expansion because @entity2 ca n't accumulate enough profit to fund development in other areas like smartphones or @entity62 , he said			1
" the priority for today is to succeed in the @entity40 area , " @entity18 said			0
" we have invested a lot in this area , and also we have seen hyper - growth in this area			0
but we have not made money from the consumer pc area			0
so we can not afford to invest more in different , other categories			0
" at @entity2 's @entity72 news conference , @entity18 discussed " the four - screen strategy , " but in the @entity4 , it only sells two of those screens			2
@entity2 and @entity76 , which has long been a proponent of selling multiple devices , define the four primary screens in the consumer electronics world as the pc , smartphone , tablet and television			0
in the @entity4 , @entity2 only sells computers and tablets			0
@entity76 sells all four in many countries and has been deploying software to tie them all seamlessly together			0
@entity2 will release its fourth screen , a connected tv set , in @entity8			1
it has gotten some buzz because its software is based on the latest version of @entity32 , heavily modified by @entity2 's programmers , rather than on @entity94			1
on @entity2 's platforms , @entity33 does not have the ability to control content in the way it does on a @entity33 tv set , like those made by @entity101 , @entity76 and @entity102			0
before it brings a tv or phone to the @entity4 , @entity2 will focus on improving its brand through pcs , and on building relationships with @entity4 cellular carriers and retailers , @entity18 said .			1

@entity2 will not go it alone when it releases smartphones and tvs in the @entity4 , ceo says
the company modified the @entity32 mobile software for its tv in @entity8
the @entity4 expansion will not come *immediately* , as @entity2 is focusing on pcs
