-- a botched gun probe that allowed hundreds of weapons to reach @entity5 's drug cartels is likely to be a lingering but not fatal controversy for the @entity9 administration , observers said wednesday			1
@entity10 in @entity11 have been publicly pounding @entity13 officials since june , when whistleblowers from the @entity15 testified to a @entity17 committee about the ill - fated " @entity18			1
" the operation , launched in 2009 , was aimed at cutting off the flow of guns to @entity5 's drug cartels through straw buyers , but it allowed about 2,000 weapons to reach the hands of the cartels			1
in december 2010 , two weapons sold under the @entity18 program were found at the scene of the killing of a @entity30 agent in the @entity32 desert			2
@entity15 agents kept their @entity5 counterparts in the dark about the probe even as rising numbers of guns crossed the border , and about 1,400 firearms remain unaccounted for , the @entity40 reported in july			1
congressional committees and the @entity13 's independent inspector - general are now looking into what happened , with republicans accusing attorney general @entity45 of trying to stiff - arm investigators			1
but as embarrassing as " @entity18 " may be , it 's not in the same league as administration - threatening scandals like @entity51 or the @entity54 administration 's @entity52 , @entity56 analyst @entity55 said			2
" the only scandals that matter in a presidential year are the ones that directly connect to a president , " @entity55 said			0
he added , " everybody admits it was a dumb idea , " but similar programs were launched during the @entity62 administration			0
nor does the controversy about " @entity18 " appear to be a mortal threat to anyone 's job at this point , said @entity70 , a former federal prosecutor and @entity13 official			1
" it 's certainly a black eye for the @entity13 , " which oversees the @entity15 , @entity70 said			1
but he added , " this is more of a botched operation rather than a scandal			2
" the flap has so far resulted in the ouster of acting @entity15 chief @entity80 and the resignation of the @entity83 attorney for @entity32 , @entity84 , in august			2
president @entity9 told @entity85 in october , " people who screwed up will be held accountable			0
" and @entity45 is likely to face tough questions about the matter next tuesday , when he is slated to appear before the @entity89			1
the committee 's ranking @entity10 , @entity92 sen. @entity91 , is a leading critic of the probe			0
@entity10 have recently questioned whether @entity45 misled @entity11 about when he learned about the program			2
@entity45 told the @entity96 in may that he had known about the @entity18 program for just a few weeks ; @entity10 say recently released @entity13 documents show the attorney general actually knew about the program in july 2010 , but a memo to @entity45 that referenced the operation does not appear to contain any of the controversial tactics it employed			1
@entity70 said @entity10 are " understandably " trying to lay the blame for the fiasco on @entity45			2
but @entity45 does n't appear to have had " intimate knowledge " of the @entity15 program			1
" there have been some suggestions that at least he knew something about it			0
he might have known the name , he might have been briefed that there was an operation , " @entity70 said			0
" i have n't seen anything that suggests that he should be held responsible for the program			0
" @entity45 slapped back in an october letter reaffirming his testimony and calling @entity10 allegations about the program " irresponsible and inflammatory			2
" and he appears to have caught a break this week , when a top deputy told senators he failed to warn @entity126 and other justice officials about the tactics used in " @entity18 " after a previous operation			0
@entity131 , the assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division , told a @entity135 subcommittee he first learned of the tactic of allowing illegally purchased guns to leave gun shops in april 2010 , regarding a previous operation known as " @entity140			1
" " i wish that at that time that i had said clearly to the deputy attorney general and the attorney general that in this case , ' @entity140 , ' we had determined in 2006 and 2007 guns had ' walked			1
' i did not do that , and i regret not doing that , " @entity131 admitted			0
@entity55 said @entity131 " is taking one for the team " by admitting the mistake			0
his testimony may not satisfy @entity10 , but , " there is n't a smoking gun here for somebody as high as @entity45 , " @entity55 said			0
nevertheless , @entity70 said , it 's likely that the questions are going to keep coming as the investigations continue			0
" i think it would be best to get out in front of it , say what really happened and let the chips fall where they may , " he said .			0

" @entity18 " let hundreds of guns reach @entity5 , investigators say
attorney general @entity45 is likely to face tough questions at an upcoming @entity89 hearing
the botched @entity15 probe is a " black eye " for the @entity13 , former official says
but the controversy is not likely to become a major scandal , analyst tells @entity0
