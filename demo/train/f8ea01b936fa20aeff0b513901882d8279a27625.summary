-- a small boatload of graduate students endured seasickness , hypothermia and huge swells in a 16 - hour swim across the @entity7 to raise money for veterans on the 65th anniversary of @entity11			1
a group of @entity14 students rest and warm up in between turns swimming in the @entity7			1
they did n't make it to the shores of @entity19 , but the physical and psychological anguish was enough to remind them of the soldiers their journey was meant to commemorate			0
" i recognize that i have not done anything			0
even an attempt to swim the @entity7 -- and a failed attempt at that -- is incomparable to the sacrifices people make on a day - to - day basis for our country , " said @entity27 , a graduate of the @entity28 who is studying at @entity29 on a @entity30 from the @entity28			1
" at the same time , i 'm happy we were able to raise some money to go toward veterans and raise awareness of the sacrifices they 're making , " he said			2
" that 's the best blessing i get from this -- not necessarily success for the hardship of our ordeal but the awareness raised , some recognition put toward people who really deserve it			2
" @entity27 , 22 , is one of five reluctant heroes who left @entity55 , @entity56 , around 10 p.m. friday , and set out over the channel 's choppy waters , accompanied by friends , the captain of the @entity61 and a representative from the @entity63			0
collectively , they swam about 23 miles in @entity65 and swim caps , slathered in petroleum jelly , against strong currents in waters that neared 55 degrees @entity70			1
swells reaching 6 - 7 feet steered them off course and knocked them against the boat at times before forcing them to turn around about 1.5 miles from their destination			2
" i would have much rather touched @entity19 soil but , at the end of the day , we swam the @entity7 , " said @entity78 , one of two people aboard the ship who managed to avoid vomiting			1
" i felt like an ant in a toilet bowl			1
it was kind of humbling			0
" yet the group , which consists of two @entity91 scholars and three @entity28 graduates who will enter seal training after school , considers the mission a success , in terms of honoring veterans of the past and present			1
they raised $ 5,000 for @entity100 , a @entity101 - based nonprofit that helps wounded and disabled veterans serving their communities after they return to the @entity14			1
" we , as a group , wanted to do this to honor the inspirational veterans of the greatest generation of the past			0
most of us had grandpas that fought in @entity117 and as a result , this historical anniversary had a special significance to all of us , " said @entity110 , a @entity91 scholar and former @entity112 employee who was injured in @entity113			1
" we also wanted to do something to recognize today 's inspirational veterans			0
we chose @entity100 because all of us believe in its mission of attempting to allow veterans injured in combat operations to continue to serve causes great than themselves when they return to us , " he said			0
the @entity100 provides wounded and disabled veterans with paid fellowships while they pursue service and leadership roles in the community , said co-founder @entity134 , a @entity135 officer who used his combat pay to help start the organization			1
" there are a lot of programs for wounded and disabled veterans designed to give them many things they need , like free backpacking trips , rental cars , access to heath care facilities , " he said			0
" but no one was giving them a challenge or an opportunity to continue their service to the country even though their wounds had cut short their military service			2
" @entity110 and @entity134 , also a former @entity91 , met after @entity110 returned from @entity113			1
through @entity110 's experiences recovering at the @entity158 , he became involved in @entity100 , helping to raise funds after he went to @entity29			0
@entity110 initiated the idea of the @entity161 as a fundraiser about six months ago and recruited @entity27 , @entity78 , @entity163 and @entity14 @entity28 graduate @entity164 to the cause			2
they trained in coastal beaches throughout the winter , but nothing could have prepared them for the experience of a midnight swim in the @entity7			1
" i went in at 1 a.m. and it was completely black			0
you ca n't see anything other than the headlight of the boat and everywhere you look is complete blackness , " said @entity163 , 25 , another @entity91 who is working on his ph.d. in political sociology			2
" we trained well but there 's no way to train for those water temperatures , plus the sensory overload of being in the middle of the @entity7 in the middle of the night surrounded by darkness			2
" the five swimmers took hourlong turns in the water , using the intervals on the ship to return to normal body temperature before they prepared to return the open sea			0
after his third time out , one of the swimmers returned with the look of a " wild animal " in his eye , according to his teammates , and fell into violent shakes			0
" we got every layer of clothing we could on him , and we had to give him bear hugs to give him some body heat , " said @entity78 , another graduate of the @entity28 , who is studying at @entity205 in @entity206 , @entity207 , on a @entity208			2
" he really left it all out there in the water			0
it was inspiring because he took it to that level			0
" @entity78 , 22 , said it has been a dream of his to swim the @entity7 ever since he visited the beaches of @entity223 in high school -- the same trip that inspired him to join the armed forces			1
" it was n't necessarily about glory , it was about @entity11 and charity and doing it as a team , " he said			0
" compared to what those who invaded on d - day had to encounter when they made it to the other side , this was chump change			1

swimmers fight rough currents , nausea in trip across @entity7
swim raised money for nonprofit that helps vets find roles in community service
two @entity91 , 3 @entity28 grads say swim also honors vets on d - day
" i felt like an ant in a toilet bowl , " swimmer says
