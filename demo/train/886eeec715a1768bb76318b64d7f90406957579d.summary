-- @entity1 your @entity2 : so easy , even a 5 - year - old could do it ? a @entity7 boy has the gaming world 's attention after he exposed a security flaw that let him log into his dad 's @entity12 account , without permission , on the family 's @entity16 console			1
" i was like ... yeah ! " young @entity18 said to @entity19 - 10 , a @entity0 affiliate			2
@entity18 's father , @entity20 , noticed soon after @entity21 that his son was logging into his account and playing games that were n't appropriate for his age			1
when he asked how , @entity18 showed him a hack that seems simple in retrospect but is fairly impressive considering a 5 - year - old found it			1
@entity18 would go to his dad 's account and type in an incorrect password			2
that would take him to a password verifications screen , where he would simply tap the space bar repeatedly and then press " enter			0
" " how awesome is that ? " asked @entity20 , who works in online security himself			0
" just being 5 years old and being able to find a vulnerability and latch on to that			0
i thought that was pretty cool			1
" he told @entity19 that @entity18 has figured out three or four other " hacks , " including getting past the lock on a smartphone by holding down the " home " key for long enough			2
@entity46 reported the vulnerability to @entity48			2
and @entity48 acted , issuing a fix for the vulnerability			0
" we 're always listening to our customers and thank them for bringing issues to our attention , " the company said in a written statement			0
" we take security seriously at @entity2 and fixed the issue as soon as we learned about it			0
" the company has even included @entity18 's name on a list of security researchers who have helped make online @entity48 products safer			1
for his discovery ( or , more accurately , for reporting it with his father 's help ) , @entity18 will receive four games , $ 50 and a year 's subscription to @entity12 from @entity48			1
whether a career in computer security awaits remains to be seen .			0
