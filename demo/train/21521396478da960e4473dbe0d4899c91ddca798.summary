for @entity3 fanatics it was a thrilling spectacle -- the sport 's top two drivers going head - to - head for the drivers ' championship title			1
that @entity9 and @entity10 were teammates , from the @entity12 , made it all the more enthralling			1
not only did they go corner - to - corner on the circuit , they also traded verbal volleys away from the pit lane			1
for @entity9 , who was ultimately beaten to the world title by the @entity21 and had to deal with plenty of criticism along the way , it was n't the first time he 'd felt like an outsider			1
as testing for the 2015 season continues , he says last term provided some trying moments but he insists he ca n't think of a better teammate than @entity10			1
" of course there have been clouds , " he told @entity3 's official website			1
" everybody has his own relative worries			2
" i was treated pretty badly by the other kids in my early school years			0
i was traveling a lot with my parents , so i never belonged to a gang -- i was always the outsider			0
" later in life i discovered the beauty of traveling , but as a small kid i hated it -- i wanted to be part [ of things ]			0
this might sound like small fry , but a seven - year - old takes that very seriously			1
" but also my racing career was cloudy at times : my two @entity53 years when i did n't go anywhere and my @entity3 dream almost became elusive			1
and even in @entity3 i had tough periods			1
" i wanted to win and had been driving so many years behind , seeing the others having these awesome cars -- @entity10 in the early days at @entity59 and @entity60 at @entity61 -- and i was just driving behind			1
" sure it was not suffering in any way , but for me individually i want to win and if i do n't win it sucks			0
but i am not dwelling on the past			0
one day after @entity67 my life was back to normal			0
" prior to last season 's runner - up berth , @entity9 's best finish in an @entity3 season was sixth back in 2013			1
but once it became clear 2014 's spoils were a straight contest between the @entity76 and @entity10 , cracks began to appear in their relationship , which began back in their teenage years			1
it reached a nadir at the @entity82 @entity81 , when the pair -- who were allowed to develop a fiercely competitive rivalry by their team -- collided early in the race			0
@entity10 was later forced to retire and told reporters after the race @entity9 had admitted to crashing into him on purpose			1
the 29 - year - old was blamed by @entity93 , fined and made to apologize , @entity10 going on to win six of the last seven races to claim his second @entity3 crown			1
but despite the negative press their spat engendered last term , @entity9 thinks its tempestuous nature is likely to continue in 2015			1
" we have a relationship that goes up and down and it will continue to go up and down , " he explained			1
" it is an intense battle between us and that will not change any time soon			1
" last year 's experience helps			2
it 's that ' been there , done that ' kind of thing			0
all the difficult times have made me stronger			2
it is the difficult moments where i learn the most			0
" of course with time , and the situation , the skin grows thicker			0
yes , there have been challenging times , but from my point of view i always felt comfortable , and it continues like that			2
" when asked if he could think of a better teammate to have than @entity10 he replied : " no. it is the challenge that i relish			1
" @entity93 ' decision to permit their two drivers to go hell for leather in pursuit of the @entity3 title was questioned in some quarters , especially after that flashpoint in @entity82			1
but according to team principal @entity135 , that modus operandi and the tension it brings can help spur his drivers onto greater heights			0
" we chose a strategy of ' let them race , ' " he explained			0
" for a team it is better to have two equally good drivers trying to beat each other but also sharing data with each other			0
" that is when a team is getting pushed forward			0
the downside -- the intense competition -- we will live with			2
we have learned from last season			2
we have matured as a team , including the drivers			0
" yes , i have no illusions that 2015 will be an easier year			2
there will again be times of discussion , sure			2
but these are the situations that bring you to the front			0
" @entity135 says everyone at @entity93 is hungry to replicate last season 's success , in which it won the drivers ' and constructors ' championship			1
and while admitting this season could see greater competition from the likes of @entity176 and @entity61 , he would n't be drawn on which of his drivers has the edge going into the new season			2
" before we start that discussion : we have to provide them with a car that gives them the tool to fight for the championship , " he said			0
" they had a very intense battle last year and i have no doubt that if they have a good car they will be fighting for wins and the championship again			1
" but honestly i do n't see 2015 as a runaway season for one of the two -- so there will be lots of ' excitement ' for the team and another sizzling season for the fans			2
" @entity204 also said he had no concerns about @entity10 's contract , which is entering its final season			1
" we are having discussions -- very positive ones , which will come to a positive end soon			0
i have no doubt about that , " he said			0
" we met each other after the break one week ago and had a good discussion			0
it 's only january and his contract runs for another year			2
" so when we discuss , it 's still about something that 's happening in 12 months			0
we want him to stay and he wants to stay , so there are no risks in taking the situation calmly			0
