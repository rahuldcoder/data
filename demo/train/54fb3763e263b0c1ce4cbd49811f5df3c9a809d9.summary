-- just a month ago , members of the @entity3 opposition army were civilians of all ages and from all walks of life			1
@entity7 , 22 , was in college			0
@entity9 , 32 , is a husband , father and an engineer			0
@entity12 , 18 , was studying business			0
but now , they 're amateur soldiers in the rickety rebel army of @entity3 opposition			1
they say they 're united by one mission -- to topple the regime of col. @entity20			1
since protests began in earnest in february , there has been no single , unifying figure in charge of the revolt			0
people of all ages and tribal affiliations have been taking part			2
one man told @entity0 that when government forces began using live ammunition against the protesters , it turned the whole community against them			0
with the rebels pushing west , gaining momentum and territory , a @entity3 without @entity20 appears more likely by the day			1
but whether democracy will follow is far from clear			0
@entity3 has long been a patchwork of tribes and rival sects , kept largely intact in the grip of @entity20 's autocratic regime			1
traditionally , opposition to @entity20 has been hampered by the fact that @entity3 's sense of national identity is " very weak , " according to @entity49 , a senior fellow at the @entity50			1
tribal loyalty in the sparsely populated @entity53 country has come first -- which made it tough for @entity20 's opponents to present a unified front			1
a nationwide network of " social leadership " committees set up by @entity20 in 1993 and composed primarily of traditional leaders and tribal leaders could seek to take charge , according to @entity63 , who has written seven books on @entity3			1
@entity20 tried without success to eliminate the more than 100 tribes in @entity3 between 1969 and 1980 , @entity63 said			1
in 1993 , he began reinforcing the tribal system and recognizing its leaders as important by creating social leadership positions , @entity63 said			0
if @entity20 leaves power , " those tribal leaders will try to find a way to put together some kind of a new government , " @entity63 said			2
" i think you 'll see the tribes being the ones that will , in the short term anyway , try to find a way through the obvious chaos that 's going to occur			0
" so far , leadership for anti-government forces has been a group effort			2
the @entity84 , created in early march , is made up of 31 representatives from across @entity3 -- local politicians , military officials who switched sides , lawyers , doctors , academics and activists			1
they have settled on @entity91 as a temporary location until the " liberation " of the capital , according to a decree the council issued			0
the council said its main missions are to represent all of @entity3 internationally , liberate the country , draft a constitution and hold elections			2
opposition leaders know the path to democracy wo n't be easy			0
but , they say , whoever tries to turn them from their path will face what @entity20 is facing now			2
