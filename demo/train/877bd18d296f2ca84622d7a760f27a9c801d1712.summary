the psychiatrist said he questioned @entity2 in november about being dishonest about his activities , and that @entity2 minimized it and called it " nitpicking			2
" @entity2 , now 56 , was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the march 1981 shooting of president @entity31 , his press secretary @entity32 , secret service agent @entity33 and @entity0 police officer @entity34			1
