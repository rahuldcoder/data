-- every third monday in january we gather as @entity2 to commemorate the values and beliefs -- as well as the ultimate sacrifice -- of dr. @entity6 his tireless advocacy for civil rights , equal protection under the law , labor rights , and for the ultimate realization of our essential creed that we are " one nation , endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights , that among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness " is taught in every school in @entity24 , and is now enshrined in a memorial on the @entity26			1
dr. @entity6 believed so strongly not only in these values , but also in the moral imperative to heed the " fierce urgency of now			1
" he knew that in the face of injustice no moral man or woman can stay silent -- and he paid for it with his life			1
he was a " drum major for justice " he inspired us -- not just with his eloquent sermons , rich in purpose ; or his speeches , inspiring and provocative -- but he challenged us with his dream , his daring imagination : to see an @entity24 where all of @entity46 's children would be equal ; all of @entity46 's children would have a seat at the table			0
dr. @entity6 , along with other men and women of his generation did not just see the barriers			1
they believed in the opportunities that could be realized if we could just move beyond racial inequality and injustice			1
he truly believed that we had to " take the first step in faith , even when you do n't see the whole staircase			2
" just take the first step			0
i 've written and spoken about dr. @entity6 many times , but this year , one area of his crusade seems particularly worthy of remembrance : the fight for the ballot			1
prior to the passage of the @entity75 , african - americans and many others faced regular and malicious restrictions to the free exercise of their constitutionally protected right to vote , especially in my native @entity79			2
literacy tests , poll taxes , and grandfather clauses : many insidious techniques were used by certain states to restrict , confuse , and write off , marginalize and disenfranchise so many eligible citizens from voting simply because of the color of their skin			2
southern governors and those in @entity91 comfortable with the status quo hid behind arguments about " states rights			2
" yet these laws were little more than legislated racism and all knew the real goal behind their unequal effects			1
in a 1957 speech titled " @entity101 , " dr. @entity6 spoke plainly about the imperative of equal voting rights			1
" so long as i do not firmly and irrevocably possess the right to vote i do not possess myself			2
i can not make up my mind â € ” it is made up for me			0
i can not live as a democratic citizen , observing the laws i have helped to enact â € ” i can only submit to the edict of others			2
" for dr. @entity6 , the right to vote was sacrosanct and foundational			1
it is the very essence of our social contract			0
they imply the consent of the governed			0
he knew that unfair elections laws did not just hurt minorities or the working poor , they rendered hollow the very essence of @entity24 government			1
it 's a message that 's as true today as it was then			0
the 47 - year old @entity75 has stood the test of time , but there are new obstacles to the ballot springing up in today 's @entity24			0
around the country , conservatives in state legislatures are attempting to put fresh roadblocks in the path of this most basic right			0
the latest vogue in anti-suffrage legislation is mandatory photo id laws			1
from @entity142 to @entity143 , from @entity144 to @entity145 , conservative @entity140 and their allies are implementing laws that undermine , even flout , the @entity75			0
the @entity147 has begun to challenge these laws , opposing new efforts in @entity150 and @entity151			0
laws in other states that have deep histories of discrimination , such as @entity143 and @entity156 , are also being examined			0
but many states , refusing to pass neutrally applicable laws , have vowed instead to sue the federal government in court			0
these laws disproportionately impact minority communities -- groups much more likely than white voters to lack photo identification for reasons as simple as the fact that they may not own a car and use the city bus to get to work			1
according a study published in 2006 by the @entity172 at the @entity173 , as many as 23 million @entity24 citizens -- that 's 11 % of those of voting age -- lack the government - issued photo id many of these laws demand			1
keep in mind , this is not just a racial issue			0
older @entity2 are less likely to have these ids , as are lower - income @entity2			1
college students , who already face challenges based on their seasonal residency , will face an even greater burden than they did previously			0
dr. @entity6 demanded that all @entity2 be given the ballot			1
we must demand today that we keep it			0
demand to keep the ballot because our laws must be made by all of us			0
demand to keep the ballot because an election where 23 million ca n't vote is an election that undermines democracy			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			2

@entity201 : @entity6 knew it was immoral to be silent in the face of injustice
she says he believed that the right to vote was *fundamental* to equality in a democracy
legislation in the 1960s *finally* *secured* voting rights for @entity2 , @entity201 says
she says many @entity2 may see their voting rights *threatened* by photo id laws
