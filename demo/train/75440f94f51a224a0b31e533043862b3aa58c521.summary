for the last month , i 've been telling you about politics in @entity4 , the state that had the lowest voter turnout rate in the nation four years ago			1
the goal of me typing and typing and typing about the state 's voters was the hope that @entity0 could start a conversation that maybe -- just maybe -- would lead to the state magically bouncing out of last place			1
it 's now the morning after @entity15			0
and while it 's still unclear whether @entity4 will finish last place for voting , preliminary estimates do offer a ray of hope			1
according to @entity21 , an election results guru at @entity23 , @entity4 likely will slip past @entity24 , handing over the title of the " state that does n't vote			2
" it feels too early and too odd to celebrate , though , especially given the calamity that ensued in @entity4 on tuesday			2
i 'll get to that soon			0
first , let 's look at the numbers			0
nationally , voter turnout was down compared to the 2008 presidential election -- with something like 60 % of the nation 's eligible voters casting ballots for president this year , @entity21 said , compared to 62 % four years ago			1
you could argue several reasons why that 's the case , from @entity41 , which depressed turnout in the northeast , to lower - than - expected enthusiasm among @entity46			2
not all of the ballots have been counted , but based on projections from @entity51 , @entity4 's turnout rate may land in the ballpark of 46.9 %			1
he expects @entity24 's turnout to be slightly lower , at 46.1 %			2
" it really is a race to the bottom right now , " he said			0
" we would be in a recount situation if this were a presidential election , " he said by phone on wednesday morning			0
" it 's close enough we need to wait to see what the final reports are , but in this case @entity4 has sort of staked out a lead here and it would be unlikely for @entity24 to come from behind			1
" voter turnout rates in both states sunk compared to 2008 , when 48.8 % of eligible people in @entity4 voted in the presidential race , and 49.9 % of people in @entity24 did			1
it 's too easy to strike up those low turnout rates to apathy			1
a story headlined " @entity4 voter turnout drops even lower " on the @entity78 news site @entity79 suggested that voters in the @entity81 are too checked - out to care			1
" hot races including a tight contest involving our own homegrown presidential contender could n't shake @entity4 voters ' continued apathy toward elections , " wrote @entity83			0
i can see where she 's coming from			0
but i think the assessment that @entity4 's ( or @entity24 's ) voter turnout rate is attributable simply to apathy is at best , reductive			1
superstorm @entity41 pummeled @entity24 one week ago , no doubt decreasing the likelihood that people would trudge out to the polls			0
and in @entity4 , as @entity101 goes on to explain , several polling places ran out of ballots , leaving long lines of voters to wait for elections officials to bring in electronic voting machines			1
@entity101 references an official from @entity4 's @entity108 who says , in her words , the ballot shortage " deterred hundreds of people from casting their ballots			1
" that should infuriate any @entity114 , especially since similar issues reportedly plagued voters in other states on tuesday			0
" we can appreciate that people lose patience with the process , and we 're very sorry it occurred , " a spokesman for @entity4 's election office told @entity79			1
i 'm going to pretend it 's @entity127 and settle into a wait - and - see mode before i give any kind of final - seeming assessment of voter turnout in @entity4			1
for one , ballots are still being counted , particularly those sent by mail			0
i also want to talk to people in the state about what happened at the polls -- why , exactly , some precincts ran out of ballots , and what people there think about the situation			0
@entity21 , the voting guru , expects @entity4 to hop out of last place despite the fact that its turnout , like that for the rest of the country , declined			2
" woohoo , " he said , sarcastically			0
given polling place issues in the state and the fact that there are potentially hundreds of disenfranchised voters on the island of @entity157 , it 's hard for me to summon much enthusiasm , either			2
still , and no matter the outcome , i 'm immensely proud of nonpartisan groups like @entity4 that go door to door in low - voting areas and encourage people to cast ballots			2
they 're the ones who are going to change attitudes toward voting in @entity4			0
and in the long term , they 're the ones who will change the list .			0

@entity4 may rank 49th for voter turnout this year ; instead of 50th
*professor* : @entity4 and @entity24 are " *dukeing* it out " for last place
@entity0 's @entity180 has been trying to start a conversation about @entity4 's low turnout
