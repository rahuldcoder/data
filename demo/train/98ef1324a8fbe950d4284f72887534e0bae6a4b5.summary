-- comedy scares people in power			2
we saw a disturbing example this week when @entity7 tv host and comedian @entity6 , frequently described as @entity7 's @entity9 , was charged with the crimes of mocking @entity7 's president @entity11 and insulting @entity12			1
if convicted , @entity6 could be fined and sentenced to prison			1
now , before you quickly categorize this incident under the catch all , " they hate us for our freedoms " crap , let 's not forget our own history			2
comedy legend @entity22 was arrested not once but eight times , in the early 1960s for telling jokes that were considered obscene			1
however , @entity22 's lawyer argued that the comedian was not being prosecuted for his profanity but rather for mocking political leaders and religion			1
in 1964 , @entity22 was convicted of violating @entity32 's obscenity laws and sentenced to four months of hard labor			2
being sentenced to hard labor is doubly painful since comedians go into comedy to avoid hard labor			2
@entity22 tragically died of a morphine overdose in 1966 while the appeal to his criminal conviction was pending			0
today , a comedian in the @entity42 is unlikely to be criminally prosecuted for profanity , mocking elected officials or ridiculing religion			0
( if they could , @entity46 and countless others would probably be on death row			0
) while some of our elected officials may hate being the target of comedians ' barbs , none would argue that jokes are a threat to our nation			0
in the @entity60 world , however , stand - up comedy and satirical political comedy shows like the one @entity6 hosts are a very new development			1
there 's a great fear in the region that this form of entertainment will undermine political leaders			1
i have witnessed this anxiety firsthand while performing stand - up comedy across the @entity74			1
the crowds are usually amazing			0
but we comedians are advised by show promoters to avoid telling jokes mocking the political leaders and religions -- not just @entity12 , but also @entity82 and @entity83			1
and of course , no sexual humor or profanity			0
i know many of you are thinking : so what 's left to talk about ? actually , plenty			0
as comedians , we are accustomed to tailoring our acts to fit certain " special " shows			0
in fact , while performing at a corporate event in the @entity42 -- such as for employees at an annual corporate retreat -- one will generally encounter similar content boundaries : no jokes about politics , sex and religion , plus , keep it clean			0
( hmm , funny how @entity42 corporations and @entity74 governments impose the same content restrictions			1
) but believe it or not , in the last few years the leash on comedians performing in the @entity74 has loosened			1
for example , in certain countries , we had to write our comedy material out word for word so local government authorities could review it for appropriateness before a show			0
no one asks for scripts any longer , because the people in power have apparently become more comfortable with stand - up comedy			0
some comedians have started to push the boundary by using some profanity and sexually suggestive material			0
inspired by @entity9 , he performed jokes about the president of @entity7 by name , even mockingly dressing like him in sketches			1
to us , this is commonplace , but in @entity7 this was unheard of			2
keep in mind that until recently , @entity7 was ruled by @entity134 , who limited public dissent in his almost 30 years of rule			2
i always knew an @entity60 @entity9 or @entity138 would emerge and use comedy to skewer political leaders			1
@entity6 has become that icon			2
but now he 's paying for his boldness			0
the question is : will @entity11 move @entity7 toward embracing democracy and freedom of expression ? or will he take a step back and follow the policies of @entity134 ? being a democratic nation entails much more than simply having elections -- it means vigilantly guarding freedom of expression , including the right of all people -- comedians , journalists , bloggers , critics -- to poke fun or disagree with the government			1
so far , early signs are not hopeful			0
the @entity42 embassy in @entity163 tweeted out a link to a segment from monday night 's " @entity166 " in which @entity9 defended @entity6			1
the office of @entity7 's president responded swiftly via @entity169 : " it 's inappropriate for a diplomatic mission to engage in such negative political propaganda			1
" president @entity11 should make it clear that the revolution in @entity7 truly ushered in democracy , and along with it freedom of expression			1
otherwise , the new leadership will be perceived as just another oppressive government			0
the world awaits @entity11 's response			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			2

@entity6 was charged with mocking @entity7 's president and insulting @entity12
@entity183 : @entity6 , considered the @entity9 of @entity7 , was performing comedy
he says there 's fear in the @entity74 that comedy will undermine political leaders
@entity183 : will @entity7 's new president embrace democracy and freedom of expression ?
