-- you ca n't change @entity2 from the inside			0
president @entity6 was criticized for stating that simple truth during the campaign , but without @entity9 organizing in support of the issues they believe in , lobbyists and special interests will drive the agenda in @entity2			1
at this crossroads for our economy , we ca n't afford business as usual			0
that 's why we 've formed @entity19 , to ensure that the voices of the majority of @entity9 who voted for policies that will strengthen the middle class will be heard			1
' @entity25 ' morphs into ' @entity19 ' as we worked for change during the president 's first term , we saw special interests spend unprecedented amounts in an attempt to persuade @entity32 to vote against policies the @entity9 people voted for			1
gun manufacturers are well represented			0
the @entity37 is running advertisements to defeat common sense gun safety measures like universal background checks , which more than 90 % of @entity9 support			1
groups with unnamed backers are advocating against comprehensive immigration reform			0
we have no plans to shrug this off and tell those @entity9 organizing their communities to stand down			2
while the president delivered the @entity50 address , volunteers at more than 1,200 events were asking their friends and neighbors to join them in ensuring that agenda is enacted			0
since @entity19 was established six weeks ago , volunteers have held more than 100 events in more than 80 congressional districts demanding a yes vote on the president 's plan to curb gun violence			2
whether it 's participating in a social media campaign or hosting a press conference , 964,000 @entity9 have already mobilized through @entity19 -- and we 've ensured they have the tools they need to get the attention they deserve			1
push - back from some quarters has been fierce			0
members of @entity32 who are used to just worrying about a few interest groups will face broader based opposition because of organizing efforts by @entity19 volunteers around the country			0
those who previously had special access will no longer be unchallenged			0
there has been some confusion about what @entity19 is and is not			0
@entity19 is an issue advocacy group , not an electoral one			0
we 'll mobilize to support the president 's agenda , but we wo n't do so on behalf of political candidates			1
the president has always believed that special interests have undue influence over the policymaking process , and the mission of this organization is to rebalance the power structure			1
@entity6 supporters launch ad campaign to push gun proposals while @entity19 is a nonprofit social welfare organization that faces a lower disclosure threshold than a political campaign , we believe in being open and transparent			1
that 's why every donor who gives $ 250 or more to this organization will be disclosed on the website with the exact amount they give on a quarterly basis			2
we have now decided not to accept contributions from corporations , federal lobbyists or foreign donors			2
supporters of @entity19 will dedicate their time to mobilize their friends and neighbors on behalf of the president 's agenda			1
whether you 're a volunteer or a donor , we ca n't and we wo n't guarantee access to any government officials			0
but just as the president and administration officials deliver updates on the legislative process to @entity9 and organizations across the ideological spectrum , there may be occasions when members of @entity19 are included in those updates			2
these are not opportunities to lobby -- they are briefings on the positions the president has taken and the status of seeing them through			0
special interests should n't have a stranglehold on the policymaking process			1
too many @entity9 worked too hard over the past six years to ensure that the middle class gets a fair shot to stop now			2
for every lobbying group that puts a dollar on the air tearing down the president 's agenda , an @entity19 volunteer will mobilize to counter it			1
instead of coming from the highest paid lobbyists on @entity151 , change will come from @entity9 organizing across the nation			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity155			0

@entity155 : *post-election* , a new organization aims to advance @entity6 's agenda
he says goal is to counter well - *funded* special interests that do n't represent majority views
an example : gun lobbyists fighting background checks 90 % in @entity9 support , he says
@entity155 : @entity171 will shun funds from corporations , lobbyists , will represent @entity9
