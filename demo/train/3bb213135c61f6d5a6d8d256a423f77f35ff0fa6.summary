which @entity0 bought the @entity1 for $ 250 million ? was it the @entity0 who helped recover two @entity4 - era f - 1 engines from the bottom of the @entity6 this spring ? a savior capable of raising rusted heaps out of their watery graves ? was it the @entity0 who 's sunk $ 42 million into the " @entity12 , " a timepiece that will run for 10,000 years entombed inside a man - made cavern carved into the top of a mountain outside of @entity17 , @entity18 ? an eccentric billionaire who 'll drop vast amounts of money into , well , a hole in the ground ? was it the @entity0 who founded @entity25 , the biggest store in the world , a company that has both transformed and trampled nearly every formerly brick - and - mortar industry it has entered , from books to shoes and beyond ? or was it the @entity0 whose personal investments -- in companies like @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and many others -- demonstrate an innate understanding of the shifting trends of the web ? each one of those @entity45 would do interesting things to the @entity1 ( well , maybe not the crazy mountain clock guy )			1
but as someone who spends every day thinking about the intersection of journalism and technology , i hope it was the @entity0 who shepherded @entity54 -- @entity54 -- into being			1
unless you build things on the @entity57 , you 've probably never heard of @entity54			2
that 's because @entity54 is in one of the world 's least sexy businesses : server and computational infrastructure			1
@entity54 began as a commerce problem			2
@entity25 needed a massive server cloud for the holiday shopping season but only a fraction of it for the rest of the year			2
that means a lot of expensive servers would be sitting idle to make sure your @entity73 presents do n't get hung up when you press " purchase			0
" so the idea hatched that those idle computer servers could be rented out to other companies			0
now , when you watch a movie streamed from @entity83 , you 're using @entity54			2
when you check out your friend 's picture on @entity86 , read a blog on @entity88 , pin something on @entity90 , you 're accessing @entity54			1
@entity91 , the " front page of the @entity57 " ? that 's built on @entity54			1
the infrastructure of the @entity96 re-election campaign -- vaunted as the most technically sophisticated campaign in history -- relied on @entity54 , too			0
the size , scale and impact of the @entity54 server cloud is massive and growing			0
@entity54 is one of the most transformative and oft - overlooked technologies of the last decade			1
and it started as little more than a " hare - brained scheme , " as @entity106 , one of the original drafters of the technology , described it in 2009			0
@entity54 is about as " all of the buffalo " as you get in technology : use every part of the tech stack so that your servers are always in use , either by you or by others			1
with @entity54 , @entity0 found value in every part of the process			1
he looked at risks and embraced " hare - brained " experiments			0
he saw opportunity in extending @entity25 technology externally , not just keeping it all in - house ( @entity54 serves the streaming movies of @entity25 's competitor @entity83 just as efficiently as it serves its own )			1
similar to the creation of @entity54 , journalism has its done its share of invention and experiments that have transformed the @entity133			2
@entity134 , a web framework used by companies like @entity90 and @entity86 , got its start in the newsroom of the @entity139			0
backbone , a javascript library that powers sites like @entity143 and @entity144 , was created as part of the @entity147 project at the @entity148			0
these newsroom technologies and others like them are transformational not just to journalism but to the entire web the same way @entity54 does n't power only @entity25			1
these spinoffs , these " hare - brained " ideas , these bits and pieces of code that start in the newsroom and end transforming the web itself , are what technologists in journalism do best when they have the right support and leadership behind them			0
that leadership is still too rare in the journalism industry			0
that may have changed in a big way on monday			0
in a letter written to @entity1 employees , @entity0 says that , moving forward , " we will need to invent , which means we will need to experiment			1
" let 's do it .			0

@entity25 's @entity0 bought the @entity1 for $ 250 million
@entity177 : i hope it was the @entity0 who shepherded @entity54 into being
he says with @entity54 , a transformative technology , @entity0 embraced experiments
sinker : leadership that allows journalists to invent and experiment is what we need
