@entity0 , @entity1 -- notorious killer @entity4 , 77 , was denied parole wednesday after a @entity1 parole panel " could find nothing good as far as suitability " for his being paroled , a commissioner said			1
@entity4 did n't show up for his parole hearing , which was held at a state prison in @entity0 , @entity1 , where he is serving a life sentence			1
@entity4 's next parole hearing was scheduled for 15 years from now , meaning he could die in prison			1
@entity1 board of parole hearings commissioner @entity14 said that @entity4 has accumulated 108 serious disciplinary violations in prison since 1971 and that he has shown no indication of remorse for his nine murder convictions			0
@entity4 has n't participated in any self - help programs or vocational training , @entity14 said			1

i have put five people in the grave			2
i 've been in prison most of my life			0
i 'm a very dangerous man , " @entity4 told the psychologist , according to a report read aloud by @entity14 during the hearing			1
those statements marked a change from @entity4 's past denials of having murdered nine people in 1969 , and the statements showed some insight into his crimes , @entity14 said , reading from the report			2
but two - member parole panel still found the statements troubling , denying him parole and scheduling his next hearing for 15 years from now , the maximum allowed under law , @entity14 said			0
that would put @entity4 at age 92 for his next hearing , unless he petitions the board for an earlier hearing			1
@entity54 deputy district attorney @entity53 , who opposed @entity4 's parole at the hearing , said @entity4 is likely to die in prison			2
@entity53 said he did n't know which " five people " @entity4 was referring to in his statement to the psychologist			1
" when you think a person will be 92 years old , it 's very likely that there will be no further parole hearings for mr. @entity4 , " @entity53 told reporters after the 80 - minute hearing concluded			1
" he does not deserve to be returned to society , " the prosecutor added			0
" he has a history of refusing to cooperate , not only with psychologists for evaluations , but also for treatment			0

@entity4 did n't come out of his cell to participate in an interview with @entity73 a month ago , @entity73 told the parole panel			1
" quite frankly , i do n't think he could have helped himself today by speaking on the record , " @entity73 told reporters after the hearing			2
@entity4 now has been denied parole 12 times , authorities said			0
@entity4 was initially sentenced to death for the grisly 1969 slayings of pregnant actress @entity89 and eight others by a group of his followers -- called his " family " -- as part of what prosecutors said was an attempt to incite an apocalyptic race war between whites and blacks during the country 's massive social unrest			0
@entity4 's death sentence was changed to life in prison after @entity1 's death penalty was overturned for a period during the 1970s			1
@entity4 and his family staged crime scenes to appear as if african - americans or the @entity111 committed the murders , @entity53 told the panel			1
he called the stabbing and shooting deaths " domestic terror			0
" after the race war , @entity4 and his followers would emerge from their desert retreat " to rule the world , " @entity53 told the panel			2
@entity4 and his followers believed the @entity124 ' " @entity123 " predicted such an apocalyptic war , @entity53 told the panel			2
@entity126 , the sister of @entity89 , who attended wednesday 's hearing , told the parole panel that she believed @entity4 declined to attend the proceeding because he did n't want to hear her or any other victim 's impact statement			1
" he clearly does not want to be released into the public , " @entity132 told the parole board			0

" i do n't have to see him again			0
for this one , it 's over			0
