@entity0 -- hundreds of thousands of @entity0 schoolchildren will return to class wednesday after the teachers union voted to suspend its strike			1
about 800 union officers and delegates met for just over two hours before there was an overwhelming voice vote to suspend the walkout , union leaders said tuesday			1
the contract agreement with the school system still needs to be ratified by the more than 29,000 teachers and support staff who are members of the union			1
@entity17 , union president , said the rank and file will vote in " the next couple of weeks			1
" @entity21 , the third - largest @entity23 school system , and the union struck a tentative bargain friday afternoon			1
but on sunday , union members decided to continue the walkout while they reviewed the proposal			1
" well , i think it is the best deal we could get at this moment in time , " @entity29 said before the meeting			1
afterwards , she said there was no such thing as a perfect contract , and that not every member of the union would be pleased			1
that included people like @entity42 , a social worker who voted no on tuesday			0
" i have two different feelings at the same time -- happy that we are so solid and we 're a tight working unit , " she said , " but at the same time i 'm sad that we were n't able to make any progress on class sizes and the school closures			0
we have a lot of parents that were supporting us , and i feel like we let them down			0
" @entity0 mayor @entity55 said the new contract is " an honest compromise			1
" @entity55 highlighted the fact that the new school day would be longer for many students			0

" in this contract we gave our children a seat at the table , " he said at a news conference			1
@entity29 told @entity1 's " @entity73 " that @entity55 had tried to bully her union members			1
" the mayor had an education agenda he wanted to ram down our throats , " she said			1
" the fact is that we were still able to enjoin our members to move as one			0
and i think that powerful message ( is ) when you work together , you accomplish magnificent things			2
we still want to work with the board of education so we can accomplish what 's really best for our kids			1
" parents and city officials will be happy to send about 350,000 children back to class after they missed seven school days			0
" i 'm just glad that everyone got what they wanted but i just wanted the children to be first , " @entity92 , a parent , told @entity1 affiliate @entity93			2
" and i believe they are first			0
" the school board posted a notice on its website : " @entity104 leadership has chosen to end the strike			1
all @entity21 will re-open on wednesday , september 19 , and all @entity21 students are expected to be back in the classroom			2
" @entity108 , chairman of the school board , said the new deal will transform the school system to the benefit of teachers and students			1
he acknowledged the negotiations were n't easy			0
" you need to know that our engagement was totally professional , and while it was extremely hard work , the work was done with purpose and with intent , i believe , the get our kids back to school , " he said			2
@entity123 , who has taught high school @entity124 for 13 years , said the strike was n't about money , rather it was about classroom conditions			0
he said that teachers were frustrated with the board , whose members are appointed and most of whom came from business backgrounds			2
" more people are going to stand up to that , " he said , referring to the situation in @entity0 and to what he called the movement toward " privatization nationwide			0
" he said the move to a longer instructional day was like making a bowl of soup into a larger bowl of soup : it only makes it bigger , not necessarily tastier			0
" we need to really be looking at ways to make things better and doing it in a smart way , " he said			0
" there was no discussion about quality ( from the school board )			0
" @entity158 : what 's behind the @entity0 teachers ' strike ? teachers walked off the job september 10 , objecting to a longer school day , evaluations tied to student performance and job losses from school closings			2
parents have juggled their families ' schedules for more than a week to make sure their children are attended to while schools are closed			0
one parent on the impact of the strike this contract calls for longer school days for elementary and high school - age students , 10 more " instructional days " each school year and a single calendar for the entire school system , as opposed to the two schedules now in place , depending on the school			2
the pay structure would change with a 3 % pay increase for the first year of the contract , 2 % for the second year and 2 % for the third year			2
if a trigger extends the contract to four years , teachers will get a 3 % pay increase			1
@entity104 members would no longer be compensated for unused personal days , health insurance contribution rates would be frozen , and the " enhanced pension program " would be eliminated			1
