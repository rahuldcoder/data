-- " drop to the ground ; take cover by getting under a sturdy table or other piece of furniture ; and hold on until the shaking stops			2
" this is the official advice issued by @entity8 for anyone unlucky enough to be caught in an earthquake			2
but even following this advice is n't always going to be enough , particularly if you have nothing solid to shelter beneath			0
this was the concern guiding @entity15 and @entity16 when they dreamed up the earthquake - proof table -- an invention that aims to provide affordable protection to people in earthquake - prone areas of the world			1
" the earthquake - proof table started when i was a student in industrial design at the @entity27 , @entity28 , " says co-inventor @entity15			1
" at the beginning i wanted a solution to help in natural disasters ... i looked at pictures of a school that was crushed in the earthquake in @entity35 and they really shocked me			2
" the 2010 @entity35 earthquake was a catastrophic event that devastated the small @entity39 island and its surrounds			2
official estimates suggest that up to 200,000 people died in the destruction			0
after seeing photographs of the aftermath , @entity15 resolved to build a product to help save lives of people trapped in structurally unsound buildings during earthquakes			0
@entity15 , alongside his former lecturer @entity16 , devised a cheap reinforced table that would be light enough for two school children to be able to lift , yet still strong enough to withstand up to one ton of pressure from above			1
@entity15 says that the geometries of the earthquake - proof table are designed to spread weight evenly across the table 's surface , ensuring that the structure holds its shape , even when subjected to significant down - force			1
the earthquake - proof table " transforms energy and absorbs it , " says @entity15			1
" when something falls on the table it absorbs the object 's energy , and debris is forced to the side			2
" in the event of a building 's collapse , the tables are also designed to form passageways through the debris to help assist in rescue efforts			0
the table was initially tested by the @entity79 military and is currently awaiting official approval of the world - leading structural engineering department of @entity83 , @entity84 , where more tests have been carried out			1
@entity15 and @entity16 estimate that 300 million children live in areas of the world prone to earthquakes with weak school buildings			0
dr @entity91 , a seismologist at the @entity92 , says that this estimation strikes him as reasonable : " there are a lot of cities in regions where large earthquakes can be expected and many of these are in the developing world			0
" since its invention last year the earthquake - proof table has been nominated for a number of awards including the @entity106 's design of the year award in @entity108			1
it has also been acquired by @entity111 's @entity110 ( @entity110 ) for its permanent collection of architecture and design			0
@entity16 says the awards are nice , but what is more important is to see the product adopted broadly , and used to save lives			0
" it 's always a good feeling to be recognised , but really it 's not awards but exposure leading to the possibility of the table being used ... we want there to be no earthquakes , and we want it ( the earthquake - proof table ) to be used to save lives			1
" @entity129 contributed to this story			0

@entity79 designers build affordable earthquake - proof table
the new design could be *valuable* in schools , especially those built near *geological* fault lines or in developing countries
the table is light enough for two children to lift , but sturdy enough to withstand a ton of falling debris
