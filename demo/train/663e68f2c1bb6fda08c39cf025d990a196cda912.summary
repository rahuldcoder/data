@entity0 -- although some people believe @entity4 is still alive , and he 's been on a stamp , the @entity2 is opening up the opportunity to honor people on a stamp who are unquestionably still around			1
the agency monday announced it has dropped a rule that imposed a five - year waiting period after a notable person 's death before they could be considered to be featured on a stamp			1
" we wanted to make sure the people we suggested had stood the test of time , " said @entity17 , the @entity2 manager of stamp programs			2
but in deciding to discontinue the rule , @entity17 explained it was limiting the number of worthwhile , relevant candidates , especially those considered meaningful by young people who might be encouraged to buy stamps			2
using the agency 's @entity31 and @entity32 accounts , as well as letters sent through the mail , the @entity2 invites the public to submit a " @entity42 " list of living individuals in a nominating process leading to a new stamp by the middle of next year			1
avoiding dubious figures remains part of the selection criteria that measures whether a candidate has done remarkable things for @entity48			2
a citizen stamp committee will review the nominees that come in over the next month 's time , and by mid-november the panel will make a final suggestion to the postmaster general who will approve or reject			1
" today with today 's news cycle , it 's hard to hide anything , and the committee will still be careful about those they pick , " @entity17 said			0
he also ruled out today 's politicians			0
" what we do n't want to do is let stamps get involved in the political process , " @entity17 told @entity1 , " so it 's very unlikely we would do politicians who are still in the game right now			2
" @entity17 said , " we 're not ruling out sports stars , musicians , writers and artists			0
" and he added " another possibility is we might feature people who are not necessarily famous right now , " but who have demonstrated real or potential achievement			2
among notable sports figures , basketball 's @entity77 , professional golf 's @entity79 , and baseball 's @entity81 may come to mind among candidates of achievement who could be considered under the new rules that include the living			0
@entity17 said " when it gets to a final stage , we do complete research " into the person who may become the first contemporary honoree , potentially ruling out anyone with questionable background since , in @entity17 's words , " surprises are not good in the world of stamps			0
" that said , @entity4 is an example of someone , dead or alive , who contributed to @entity48 culture			1
in 1992 , long after his generally accepted death in 1977 , the @entity2 held a public vote as to whether an @entity4 stamp should depict him early in his career , or how he was in later years			1
the portrayal of a " young " @entity4 won out , on a margin of three - to - one from more than a million votes cast			0
" @entity4 was the king of stamps , " said @entity2 spokesman @entity110 , who said the runoff nearly 20 years ago was conducted using only post cards obtained and mailed at 40,000 post offices nationwide			1
the @entity2 is in the midst of closing thousands of post offices as part of a financial overhaul to cut red ink			0
the commemorative stamp program brings in about $ 200 million a year in profit			0
" the main source of profit is those who buy and keep the stamps , " @entity17 explained , " it 's serious money , but it 's a relatively small drop in the gap we have to close			0
" still , if the popularity of @entity31 and @entity32 can supplement snail mail , postal officials believe the competition to name the first living person featured on a @entity48 stamp may top the public 's participation in the @entity4 runoff .			1
