-- the @entity1 said wednesday it does not fault authorities in @entity3 for using lethal force against exotic animals running loose			1
police believe the animals ' owner , @entity9 , 62 , freed the animals -- lions , tigers , leopards and grizzly bears -- at his preserve near @entity16 , @entity3 , before dying from a self - inflicted gunshot wound , @entity7 sheriff @entity6 said			1
@entity3 authorities were called to the scene tuesday night			1
as of wednesday , 49 animals had been killed and the rest were accounted for except for one monkey , according to authorities			1
but @entity6 and conservationist @entity22 , who assisted in the effort , said the animal may have been eaten by one of the big cats			0
a preliminary investigation showed @entity9 had pried open cages and left fences open , @entity6 said			0
autopsy results on @entity9 were pending			0
authorities were trying to use tranquilizers whenever possible in capturing the animals , said @entity16 mayor @entity34			1
but @entity6 said some animals were shot at close range by deputies who found themselves in a dangerous situation			1
a bengal tiger was put down after it became agitated following a tranquilizer shot			1
49 animals killed , authorities say while the killing of animals might prompt initial concern , " we do not fault them for using lethal force , " said @entity43 , captive wildlife regulatory specialist for the @entity1			1
" what we 're finding , in places where they have lax regulations ... rural sheriffs and local animal control officers are being forced to deal with issues ranging from rampaging chimpanzees to tigers running amok , " @entity43 said			2
such officers are not trained to deal with such situations and may lack the proper equipment , she said			0
@entity34 said he had received calls from people concerned the animals were killed			2
but , @entity6 said , " we are not talking about your normal everyday house cat or dog			0
these are 300 - pound bengal tigers that we have had to put down			2
when we got here , obviously , public safety was my number - one concern			2
we could not have animals running loose in this county			2
" while tranquilizers are an option , there are issues involved in their use , @entity43 said			2
for one thing , they take time to work on an animal , potentially giving it time to harm someone or to get away			0
in addition , if an animal has a high level of adrenaline , tranquilizers can make them more agitated , she said			0
" people should n't be blaming ( authorities ) , " she said			2
" they should be blaming the @entity3 government for not taking action to prevent this incident			1
" @entity0 readers disgusted the @entity98 urged @entity3 officials wednesday to issue an emergency rule to crack down on exotic animal ownership			1
a previous emergency order issued by then - gov. @entity103 that prohibited people convicted of animal cruelty from owning exotic animals expired in april			1
the organization said @entity9 " would almost certainly have had his animals removed by may 1 , 2011 , if the emergency order had not expired			2
" " every month brings a new , bizarre , almost surreal incident involving privately held dangerous wild animals , " said @entity110 , president and ceo of the @entity98 , in a prepared statement			1
" in recent years , @entity115 have died and suffered injuries because the state has n't stopped private citizens from keeping dangerous wild animals as pets or as roadside attractions			0
owners of large , exotic animals are a menace to society , and it 's time for the delaying on the rulemaking to end			1
" opinion : wild animals belong in the wild @entity132 also said the lack of an exotic animal ban is to blame			1
" the shooting of dozens of exotic animals in @entity16 is a tragic example of just how wrong things can go when people are allowed to keep wild animals , " @entity132 said in a written statement			1
the organization said it hoped the incident will be a " wake - up " call to current @entity3 gov. @entity145 , who , according to @entity132 , refused to extend the emergency ban on exotic animals			1
" keeping exotic animals is inhumane and unsafe for both animals and people , and it 's time that @entity3 did something about it , " @entity132 said			1
" people have to understand something ... human life comes first , " @entity22 , director emeritus of the @entity153 , told @entity0			0
he said some had asked why the animals were n't tranquilized by authorities searching for them tuesday night , but " you ca n't tranquilize an animal in the dark			2
it upsets them ... they settle in , they hunker down , they go to sleep			0
obviously , we ca n't find them in the dark			0
so what had to be done had to be done			0
even a bear came after one of the officers last night , and she was just trying to get out of a car			0
... no one loves animals more than me , but human life has to come first			0
" when first responders do have to shoot an animal , " we have found , in some cases , they 're just as traumatized as the rest of us , " @entity43 said , and sometime require counseling			0
" they do n't want to have to shoot these animals			0
" she recalled a case a few years ago involving a @entity189 police officer who shot an elephant running wild with children on its back			0
" he was so totally upset by that incident that he became a huge elephant advocate , " speaking out for stronger laws on their behalf , @entity43 said .			0

@entity3 authorities have shot some loose exotic animals
@entity98 : @entity3 's government should have prevented this
there are issues with tranquilizer use , the organization says
@entity132 says the incident should be a " wake - up call "
