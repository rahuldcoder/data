@entity0 , @entity1 -- senate minority leader @entity3 uses sports metaphors to describe why he should be re-elected and not sacked by @entity6 @entity5 , who would be @entity1 's first woman senator			1
" change the @entity10 and make me the offensive coordinator instead of the defensive coordinator , " @entity7 said to a small but enthusiastic crowd in @entity9			1
" sports fans know you can score on defense , but it 's hard			2
when you 're on offense , you get to call the plays and set the agenda for @entity1 and for @entity20			0
that 's what makes a big difference			0
" translation : after two straight elections in which @entity27 fumbles kept @entity27 in the minority , @entity7 has another chance at running the @entity10 as majority leader , but that wo n't happen if he 's defeated here at home and knocked out of the game			1
2014 midterms : key races to watch on the eve of primary day here , @entity7 appears confident he has crushed his challenger from the right , @entity43			1
but it remains to be seen how much of a toll the manpower and money he has spent against @entity43 will take -- whether it will weaken him in what is expected to be the toughest campaign against a @entity52 challenger in the three decades he has been in office			1
general election : who can better define @entity5 ? it is also unclear whether the @entity27 who do n't support @entity7 in the primary will end up voting for him in the fall			1
@entity7 's campaign points out that @entity27 primary voters largely rallied around @entity62 after a divisive @entity27 battle in 2010 and hope the same will happen this year for @entity7			1
@entity5 , a 35 - year - old attorney and @entity1 's secretary of state , has a classic campaign strategy against the 72 - year - old , five - term @entity10 incumbent : it 's time for change			1
" we 've had 30 years of failed leadership under @entity3 ; we can not afford six more , " @entity5 declared emphatically to a packed house at her campaign headquarters here in @entity0			1
5 key primaries to watch on tuesday to counter that , @entity7 is using a classic strategy for a longtime incumbent			1
he is trying to paint his seniority as a plus and warn @entity83 about the perils of a junior senator with little clout in @entity87 representing them instead of a potential @entity10 majority leader			0
" my opponent , i certainly agree , is a new face , but a new face for what ? new face for the status quo			0
same majority leader , same agenda , no change at all			0
a new face for no change at all , " @entity7 argues on the stump			1
but @entity5 ' full - throated assault on @entity7 goes beyond a call for change			1
she is using @entity7 's @entity27 leader status and his frequent moves to block legislation to make him the symbol of gridlock in @entity87			1
we put that to @entity7 in a brief interview			1
" what @entity83 have to decide is which direction they want the country to take , " @entity7 told @entity2			2
" do we want to go in a different direction , or do we want @entity118 to continue to be the majority leader ? do we want a vote for @entity121 in a state that he carried four out of 120 countries ? that 's what 's really at stake in the fall election , " @entity7 told us			1
poll : democrats competitive in key @entity131 showdowns like republicans all over the country , @entity7 is trying hard to make this election a referendum on @entity121 , who lost @entity1 big in 2012 and is highly unpopular now			2
the problem for @entity7 is that he too has a high unfavorable rating , and @entity52 here are hoping that will be his ultimate downfall			2
but @entity7 has already been working hard to soften his image with positive television ads. he is also almost always accompanied at campaign stops by his wife , former @entity146 labor secretary @entity145			1
at their appearance in @entity9 , she introduced @entity7 by calling him her " soul mate			2
" @entity27 hope that helps another challenge he has in his race against @entity5 : women			2
@entity5 is unabashed in her quest to get female voters to the polls by reminding them that she would be their first female senator , but also by ripping @entity7 on issues relating to women , such as his opposition to equal pay legislation like the @entity164			2
" i hope you will spread the word not just across @entity169 but the @entity1 that this woman , well , she 's not an empty dress , she 's not a cheerleader , she 's not a rubber stamp , she 's an independent @entity1 woman that stands on her own two feet , " @entity5 yelled to her crowd here			0
@entity5 edges out @entity7 in cash battle when asked about what polls show is a wide gender gap between him and @entity5 , @entity7 turned to @entity180			2
" women in @entity1 have been treated just as badly in this environment as men have			0
@entity180 , you know women are typically those who manage their family 's health care			0
they 've been adversely impacted by @entity180 in a serious way			0
surveys indicate women object to @entity180 even more than men			0
i think it ought to be pulled out from the root of the grass , and we ought to start over			0
i know that 's not the view of my opponent in the fall , " @entity196 told @entity2			2
as for @entity5 , she may be trying to make @entity87 's problems all about @entity7 , but she also clearly knows she has to overcome deep opposition to the president by separating herself from him			1
" this election is not a referendum on the president			0
nothing about this election is going to change who our president is , but we can actually change who is in @entity87 , and put someone there who fights for the people of this state instead of looking out for his own job , " @entity5 told @entity2			0
she has been trying to aggressively criticize the president 's policies on coal , seen in this coal - producing state as punitive			0
like other democrats on the ballot this year , she sidestepped our questions about whether she would welcome the president 's help			0
she did , however , tell us she would love to campaign with @entity229 , whom she called her " role model			0
" @entity5 ' father was a prominent supporter of president @entity233 during his campaigns and presidency			0
the former president , whom she called " family , " has already been to @entity1 to raise money for @entity5 .			0

@entity3 seems set to cruise to a primary win , but the cost remains to be seen
it 's also unclear whether tea party @entity27 who opposed @entity7 will vote in the fall
@entity247 is using classic campaign against @entity7 : it 's time for a change
