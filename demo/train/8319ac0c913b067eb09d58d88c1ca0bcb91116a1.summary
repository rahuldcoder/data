-- another day , another record broken			0
@entity2 must sometimes wonder what all the fuss is about but to those in the outside world who remain permanently entranced by the genius contained within his feet , it was another opportunity to unleash a barrage of superlatives towards a football phenomenon			2
just days after breaking the record for the top scorer in @entity16 football history , @entity2 went one further , establishing himself as the leading marksman in the history of the @entity19			1
@entity2 scored a hat - trick for @entity21 in its 4 - 0 victory against @entity23 in @entity24 on wednesday to take his tally to 74 goals in 91 appearances			1
@entity28 , who scored 71 goals in 142 appearances , was unlikely to hold onto his record for much longer with @entity2 and @entity32 rewriting the history books			1
@entity2 , who began the night level with @entity28 , required 38 minutes to break the record before adding a couple more for good measure later on			1
he now sits three clear of @entity32 , who will hope to feature for @entity39 against @entity41 side @entity40 on wednesday night			0
it is easy to forget that @entity2 is only 27			2
this latest landmark is just one in a number which he has reached in recent years			0
the @entity21 forward , whose future at the club has come under some question in recent weeks , hit the headlines last weekend by scoring a hat - trick in the 5 - 1 win over @entity53			1
@entity55 's record of 251 @entity16 league goals had stood for 59 - years but it would take a brave person to bet against @entity2 's remaining longer			1
@entity2 's record of 253 will no doubt be extended in years to come as will his exploits in the @entity19			1
the forward has scored 368 goals in all competitions for @entity21 so far , while he registered 91 times during an incredible 2012 -- beating the previous best of 85 in a calendar year by @entity66			2
the 2011 - 12 campaign was one of @entity2 's most successful as he scored 68 goals , 50 of those coming in just 37 league games , 44 with his left foot and just one with his head			2
@entity2 , who won the prestigious @entity75 four times between 2009 - 12 , netted in 21 consecutive league matches last season which enabled him to score against every other club in the @entity16 top flight			1
with his team safely through to the next stage of the competition , @entity2 will hope to inspire @entity21 to @entity19 glory following a disappointing campaign last year			1
one man who is eager to help @entity2 achieve the feat is @entity89 , who scored his first goal for the club since joining from @entity92			1
@entity89 scored the opening goal in @entity24 before @entity2 took over , scoring three times to secure the win			1
@entity21 sits second in its group , a point behind @entity98 , which defeated @entity99 3 - 1 to remain top			1
@entity100 @entity2 was n't the only @entity102 striker to hit a hat - trick on wednesday as @entity105 's triple propelled @entity104 to a 3 - 2 win over @entity107			1
trailing 2 - 1 to 10 - man @entity107 , @entity105 scored twice in the final five minutes of the contest to keep his side 's qualification hopes alive			0
@entity107 , which is already through to the knockout phase , suffered a nightmare start when @entity113 was sent off for a professional foul on @entity105			0
the forward stroked home the penalty as @entity104 took control only to be knocked out of its stride before the break			0
@entity123 's free kick drew @entity107 level and @entity125 added a second just before the break			0
@entity104 looked down and out but @entity105 's late heroics ensured @entity104 can still qualify for the next stage			0
that 's because @entity131 was held to a 1 - 1 draw by @entity133 in @entity134			2
@entity135 rifled home a free kick for the @entity139 side which was pegged back in the final minute of stoppage time			0
@entity131 will qualify for the next stage if it defeats @entity104 , while the @entity142 club can progress with a victory or a score draw if @entity133 loses			0
@entity133 must win at @entity107 and hope that the other game finishes level			0
in @entity147 , @entity146 secured top spot with a 5 - 0 thrashing of @entity150 in @entity151			0
@entity152 fired the visiting side ahead before @entity154 doubled its advantage			0
an own - goal by @entity157 made it three before @entity158 and @entity159 completed the humiliation			2
in @entity162 , @entity161 ensured it will finish top with a 3 - 0 win at @entity165 , while @entity166 was beaten 1 - 0 by @entity167 .			0
