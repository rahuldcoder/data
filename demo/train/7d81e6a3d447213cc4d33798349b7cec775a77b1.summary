-- the @entity1 must resolve what i call the @entity4 by clarifying its policy toward @entity6			1
it can not treat its @entity6 citizens as second - class citizens at home and hope to win them over abroad			1
@entity1 @entity6 complain of their second - class status by pointing out that their religion and houses of worship can be attacked with near impunity			1
when they do object , they are told that this kind of abuse is a small price to pay for living in a free society			0
yet it is blatantly clear that only @entity21 is being attacked in such a crass fashion			1
it is virtually unimaginable to hear of any other ethnic or religious group being so targeted without an uproar			0
the conundrum came into being on 9/11			2
that day , we saw how 19 men could plunge two world civilizations into world confrontation			0
they succeeded in creating conflict between @entity1 and the @entity6 world , and almost 10 years later , nothing but a big black hole remains where the @entity36 once stood			1
@entity6 have not fully understood how deeply symbolic 9/11 has become for @entity1			1
they have neither forgotten nor have many forgiven			0
now a plan to create an @entity21 center near the site of the @entity36 has exacerbated tensions between @entity6 and @entity42			1
the imam behind the center is a well - meaning and scholarly man who did not clearly think of the consequences of his actions			2
most @entity1 see the befuddled actions of the imam as rubbing salt in their raw wounds			1
non-muslims are already threatening to blow up the center as soon as it is constructed			2
once again , we are reminded how easy it is for individuals to drag their respective civilizations into conflict			0
across the land , stories are emerging of other mosques under pressure or attack			0
when traveling throughout the @entity1 for my project , " @entity65 , " to study the @entity66 , we visited about 100 mosques			1
we saw some with windows smashed and others destroyed			0
the mosque in @entity72 , @entity73 , had been firebombed			0
graffiti with @entity76 slogans appeared on the walls still standing			0
when told to go " home , " the @entity6 worshippers , especially the young , were puzzled			2
" we are home , " they said			0
in the midst of this crisis there was light			0
the heroic rev. @entity86 approached @entity6 and offered them the keys to his presbyterian church , even suggesting he would remove anything they found offensive when they said their prayers there			1
@entity93 , the month of fasting , will start in the next day or two			0
most @entity6 who fast tend to spend more time than usual in mosques			2
many young men dress in traditional clothes to worship late into the night			0
sensibilities are heightened and worshippers are in a state of high spiritual excitement			0
the stage is almost set for those non-muslims looking for a fight			0
as if the situation around mosques was not already tense enough , the rev. @entity106 of " @entity107 " in @entity108 has declared september 11 " @entity111			0
" this is as provocative for ordinary @entity6 as an imam promoting the burning of the @entity115 would be for @entity1			1
all this would be headache enough for those who want peace and harmony within communities , but there is an international dimension to it			2
gen. @entity123 , the head of @entity1 forces in @entity126 , has repeatedly expressed the need for winning the " hearts and minds " of local people by treating them with dignity and respect			1
this way , he hopes to marginalize or weaken support for the @entity136			0
those @entity1 who believe they are being patriotic when they attack mosques or burn the @entity138 need to ask how @entity123 would respond to their actions			2
will it help @entity1 troops in @entity126 and @entity142 , both deeply conservative and religious societies ready to fight for @entity21 ? or would it make their task more difficult ? no one -- least of all prominent @entity1 figures like @entity148 and @entity149 , who have jumped so blithely into the discussion and condemned the @entity153 center -- must underestimate the danger			1
we are sitting on a tinderbox			0
a serious attack on a mosque in which people die could trigger a revenge attack , which would in turn create further attacks against @entity6			2
because everything happening in @entity1 is seen in the @entity6 world , murder and mayhem would follow globally			1
i believe those who chose the site for the @entity21 center ( to be called @entity171 ) should have been more culturally sensitive			1
but now that plans are developed , there are ways to calm the situation			0
considering the seriousness of the situation , i suggest the following steps be taken seriously and urgently			0
for a start , the imam in @entity153 should ensure that the cultural center -- which he has clarified is not simply a mosque -- invites @entity183 and @entity184 to include a church and a synagogue so that the building is truly a symbol of interfaith worship			1
that is the @entity1 way			2
also , the center must include a special memorial to those who died on 9/11 , as proposed , so that people of different faiths can pray for their souls and thus begin to heal the wounds			1
president @entity198 should deliver a strong call to the nation , on the onset of @entity93 , for religious tolerance , and make it clear that no violation of this law of the land will be allowed			1
it is time he walked the walk , and not just talked the talk , to live up to the promise of his speech to the @entity6 world in @entity214 , @entity215			2
bishops , rabbis and imams must work vigorously to bring the temperature down			1
interfaith conferences in churches , synagogues and mosques should be conducted			0
muslim leaders should organize iftar parties at the opening of the fast to invite non-muslims , to create good will for the community			0
the media has too often played a negative role by associating @entity21 with violence and terror			1
it is time for media to play a more responsible role			0
tv news shows , for example , should encourage more @entity6 guests to participate , so that @entity1 can finally begin to see @entity6 as normal people and not members of a threatening alien species			1
given the situation in @entity1 , both @entity6 and @entity42 need to be much more culturally sensitive to each other			1
@entity6 leaders need to be more active in explaining @entity21 to non-muslims , and non-muslims need to appreciate @entity6 as citizens and fellow countrymen			1
these steps will help resolve the @entity4			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity254 .			2

@entity254 : @entity1 ca *n't* treat @entity6 badly and win " hearts and minds " abroad
if proposed @entity21 center ever attacked , @entity254 says , global violence will ensue
@entity21 center should also include church , synagogue and 9/11 memorial , he writes
*ahmed* : bishops , rabbis and imams must work together ; @entity198 must call for peace
