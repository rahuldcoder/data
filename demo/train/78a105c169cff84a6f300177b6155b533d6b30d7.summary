-- fifty years after president @entity3 's assassination , there are very few down - the - line defenders of the @entity5 to be found			1
the investigation into @entity8 's murder was inadequate , rushed and manipulated by powerful officials			1
just consider a few of the commission 's flaws			2
-- president @entity13 and fbi director @entity14 had all but decided what the report would say -- that @entity17 was the lone gunman with no conspiracy -- within 48 hours of the shooting			1
-- the report was issued on a political timetable			0
@entity13 wanted it out well before his election in november 1964			0
-- the @entity24 was less interested in the full truth and more determined to avoid blame for misreading @entity17 's violent character			1
@entity14 later admitted : " we failed in carrying through some of the most salient aspects of the @entity17 investigation			1
it ought to be a lesson to all			0
" -- far worse was the behavior of the @entity36 , which coached some witnesses , hid others and withheld important information			0
the agency never told the commission it had been keeping tabs on @entity17 or why			1
to this day , the @entity36 says it did not have a relationship with @entity17 and that it is not withholding anything important about the assassination from the public			1
-- even more suspiciously , the @entity36 maintained its subterfuge and continued to lie to yet another official @entity8 investigation in the 1970s , this one run by the @entity48 @entity47			1
it was a chance to come clean , with lesser consequences , and the @entity36 did n't take it			0
the director of that study , @entity53 , now denounces the @entity36 and says he does n't believe anything the agency told him and his panel			0
-- both the @entity36 and the @entity24 failed to inform the commission about their various arrangements with the @entity60 , another prime suspect in @entity3 's killing			2
they considerably underplayed @entity17 killer @entity65 's organized crime ties			1
" the evidence does not establish a significant link , " the commission asserted , but in fact , @entity67 was in frequent contact with mobsters			0
-- a surprising number of first - hand , close - in witnesses from @entity74 on november 22 were never interviewed by the commission			0
these people had useful information to impart			0
i interviewed some of them , still living after the passage of five decades , and to this day they can not understand why the commission was uninterested			0
-- the commission dismissed or ignored some compelling testimony that contradicted its preferred findings			0
thus , the @entity5 failed to find the full truth when the trail was hot , and when most @entity48 would have welcomed the most thorough possible investigation , even if the process was lengthy and costly			1
we can never recapture that moment , or reel in the cynicism that has developed because of its inadequacies			0
if we could go back in time , maybe it would be possible to figure out why the @entity36 was so interested in @entity17 or why the @entity24 was so responsive when @entity17 demanded to see its agents while he was in a @entity98 jail in august 1963			1
( ask yourself whether the @entity24 would come running if you summoned it while incarcerated on a minor charge			0
) it would also be useful to know what really happened when @entity17 visited the @entity105 and @entity106 embassies in @entity107 just two months before the assassination			1
with this extensive a list of shortfalls , is it any wonder the @entity5 is widely derided ? so , it may come as a surprise that , despite everything , a large part of the commission 's basic conclusion turns out to be correct			1
@entity17 almost certainly was the man who killed president @entity3			1
under an alias , he had mail - ordered an @entity121 rifle from @entity122			0
the @entity124 police found photos of @entity17 holding a rifle , taken by his wife			1
contrary to theories that float on the @entity130 , the pictures were not doctored			0
@entity17 had demonstrated violent tendencies by attempting to kill major gen. @entity132 in april 1963			1
@entity17 's wife has recalled that he had also made a veiled threat against former vice president @entity135			1
@entity17 's rifle was found , and his palm print was identified on a box inside the sniper 's nest on the sixth floor of the @entity142			1
the trajectory of the bullets fired from the open window essentially matches the wounds suffered by both president @entity3 and @entity142 gov. @entity147 , who was sitting a few inches lower and to the left of @entity8 in the jump seat in front of the president			1
after @entity17 's first bullet missed the car entirely , the so - called " magic bullet " that struck @entity8 in the back was perfectly aligned to do substantial damage to @entity147 's body			1
and the final bullet that hit @entity8 in the head came from up and behind him , not the front			1
there is a reasonable physiological explanation for the actions of the president 's body in the car once his skull was blown apart			2
two @entity124 reporters in the motorcade saw a rifle protruding from the window ( though not oswald himself , who was shielded )			0
a depository employee watching the motorcade from the fifth floor window below the one with the gun testified that he heard the sound of a fast - moving bolt action rifle and brass cartridges falling on the floorboards just above his head			0
a homemade paper bag was left on the sixth floor , and the employee who gave @entity17 a ride to the depository on the morning of november 22 testified that @entity17 was carrying a parcel wrapped in brown paper that @entity17 claimed was " curtain rods , " but which just as easily could have been a disassembled rifle			2
@entity17 was the only employee found missing from the depository a short while after the assassination			1
most of the ballistics and eyewitness evidence suggests that @entity17 shot officer @entity198 later that afternoon -- hardly the deed of an innocent person			2
@entity17 tried to shoot another officer at the @entity202 when he was captured a little while later , shouting , " it 's all over now			1
" @entity17 was a deeply troubled man , a castaway who never fit well anywhere and could get along with few			2
he was someone yearning to be great but without the wherewithal to achieve it			0
at the end of his rope on november 22 , 1963 , @entity17 had left his wedding ring and most of his money behind for his wife @entity211 and his two young daughters			2
he grabbed his rifle and planned to go out in a blaze of history - making glory by striking out at the ultimate symbol of power and success , a president who by pure chance would be passing by his place of low - level employment			0
had @entity17 not been killed by @entity65 , we probably would have learned as much in a few weeks or months			2
yet the story does n't necessarily end with @entity17			2
there is no question that many powerful individuals and groups , some with whom @entity17 had personal association , possessed the means , motive and opportunity to kill president @entity3			2
was @entity17 encouraged or manipulated in any way ? did anyone overtly or covertly aid him ? after the assassination , were the @entity24 and especially the @entity36 simply trying to cover up for their incompetence in missing @entity17 's nature and intent , or were there more sinister motives ? so much time has passed that we may never know , but our one chance to discover more is in the release of thousands of additional pages of memos relating to the assassination , including hundreds of items from the @entity36			1
after 50 years , it is absurd that anything is still hidden			0
supposedly , the documents will be made public in a few years , but there is no guarantee			0
the @entity257 , signed by president @entity258 in 1992 , requires that all remaining documents about the @entity3 assassination be released by october 26 , 2017			2
the next president will rule on any requests from the @entity36 and other agencies that materials be withheld or redacted after 2017			0
under the law , the president can do so only if there is identifiable harm to our national security that outweighs the public interest in disclosure			0
but it 's possible the @entity36 could succeed in having some memos held back and others substantially redacted			2
the right time came long ago for complete disclosure			0
transparency can not bring president @entity3 back , but at long last it can help @entity48 to come to terms fully with november 22 , 1963 -- and perhaps to prevent similar events in our future			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity286 .			2

@entity286 : the investigation into @entity8 's murder was inadequate and rushed
@entity286 : although the @entity5 is derided , its basic conclusion is correct
he says @entity17 was the killer , but was he manipulated in any way ?
@entity286 : we need transparency ; memos relating to the assassination must be released
