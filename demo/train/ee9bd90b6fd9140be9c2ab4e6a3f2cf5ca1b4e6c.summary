-- there are cool whites instead of lush greens , herbal showers instead of holes - in - one and empowering juices not intoxicating malt whiskies on the bar menu			1
a sleek health club in central @entity10 and @entity11 -- home to golf 's 2013 @entity13 -- might not have much in common but they are agreed on one thing -- they only accept members of a certain sex			1
@entity18 is one of a few female private members club in the @entity20 while , north of the @entity22 border , @entity11 is notorious for its men - only membership code			1
women are invited to play at the historic club as visitors or guests but can not become members , a policy the club has no plans to change			0
but is there still a place in the @entity36 's equality - conscious society for single - gender institutions ? " why should there not be ? " @entity39 , co-founder of @entity40 told @entity0 in the club 's tranquil environs			1
" it 's not anti-feminist , it 's not anti-men			1
" it 's just a fact that some women , not all women , feel more comfortable in an environment where there are other women around			1
battle of the testosterone " the women that come here know it 's a very relaxing place because the men are not here			1
this becomes a haven , a sanctuary from the battle of the testosterone			0
" at @entity11 the " battle of testosterone " will be very much in evidence when golf 's oldest major tees off on thursday and no - one watching the prestigious tournament will be particularly troubled by this primeval male instinct			1
but when the @entity13 is awarded to @entity11 -- one of three clubs along with @entity70 's and @entity71 on the @entity13 rotation which still operate men - only membership policies -- there is always intense criticism			1
@entity22 's first minister @entity76 has publicly pronounced his disapproval of the male - only policy by effectively boycotting the event			1
there is a view that holding a global tournament at a club which does not accept female members vindicates @entity86 values of patriarchy and keeps women in their place			1
but @entity90 does not necessarily agree -- instead she argues that male - only or female - only policies represent an expression of freedom , not constraint			1
" if what people are trying to say is that it is putting women down because they are n't allowed to join , i do n't think that 's the issue , " @entity90 said			1
" if men want to have their own club by all means have their own club , if women want to similarly			0
" if some men choose to play golf only with men that is absolutely fine			2
no - one is forcing anyone to go to an all - male club			2
" when @entity18 opened there was just one comment right at the beginning when a journalist said this was anti-feminist			0
" i think the point that they were trying to make is that women have striven for hundreds of years to have equality and someone is going backwards by having a women 's only club but i just could n't understand that argument			2
" for me , this is really liberating and really being independent of thought , saying no , we want our space because there are lots of issues we want to take up			0
" golf economics nestled at the back of the19th @entity132 of @entity133 is a parkland golf course , home to the @entity136 -- which claims to be the oldest female - only golf club in the world and the only one in @entity22			1
the club was established in 1891 as a separate entity from the nearby men 's club and is now run solely by women as a picturesque place for a game of nine holes			1
men can play on the ladies ' course but only women can become members			0
" it 's a nice welcoming environment for ladies getting into golf , " club captain @entity152 told @entity0			1
" we have beautiful views up to the north			0
" but with a dwindling number of local ladies that play golf , @entity159 concedes that it might be difficult to survive as a single - gender club			1
" a lot of our members are quite elderly , " @entity159 explained			0
" it 's the way that things are now			2
young women are working and working longer			0
that 's a bit of a downside			2
" most clubs are just a ladies section in a mixed club so it does mean there are considerable extra responsibilities such as staff , ground maintenance , starters and two greenkeepers			2
" financially it 's becoming more difficult as time goes on as we do n't have the numbers			2
the older ladies here will talk about when they used to come up to pay to play on the course in the summer holidays			0
" people used to be desperate to play and queue up but we 're not in that favorable position now			0
" we are finding it harder to make ends meet and the longevity of the club probably is not too rosy			0
" just up the road at the @entity133 men 's club -- where a weekday round costs $ 120 -- the scenario could not be more different			2
" there is no comparison with our wealth and the wealth that is in the men 's club , " @entity159 added			2
" they still have a waiting list for membership			0
they are in a very fortunate position financially			0
" the ladies ' club might just be sustainable if we have a closer relationship with the men 's club			2
" in fact , @entity159 argues that closer relationships between men and women in the game of golf -- and beyond -- could be the solution to the furore over the female - ban at @entity11			1
" we may all have to give in to the point where all clubs are mixed , " she said			2
" it 's the way things are going in society and in sports			2
" i do n't see that sports clubs have any reason to be any different			2
it 's just equality in all things			2
" in time , what we 're doing just now will look pretty archaic to future generations when they see that certain people were excluded from certain golf clubs			1
" historic hangover @entity242 , chief executive of the @entity243 , which organizes the @entity13 , argues that the single - sex policy of @entity11 -- and others -- is a historic hangover			1
" single sex clubs are still something of a feature in @entity22 , " @entity242 told @entity0			1
" it 's a historical thing actually because women came to the game of golf when men were already established			1
" it 's something that is reported as an issue far more than the actuality of it			0
we have a situation where about 1 % of clubs in the @entity20 are single sex - it 's a very small number			1
" @entity263 has moved on from the stereotypes of 50 years ago			0
it is chalk and cheese and we 'll just have to wait and see what happens in the year ahead			0
" in @entity272 in the south of @entity271 there is already a positive example of a single - gender club that has happily merged into mixed living			1
the @entity276 -- which can count the late queen mother as its club captain in the 1932 -- was established in 1902 as a place for women to play the game			0
it took more than a century for men to be admitted as members -- but club secretary @entity285 says the advantages of mixed membership are self evident			0
good mixers " there are ladies out there who do not want to join a ladies - only club , " @entity285 told @entity0			0
" then there are other people who might feel intimidated by a male - dominated environment			0
here those people might feel less intimidated			0
" society is mixed so there is no reason for this club not to be			0
the best friends i 've made , i 've made playing golf			0
" i play golf here with my wife very happily and afterwards we have a damn good sunday lunch in the clubhouse			0
" whether it is tee for two or tea for two , the concept is one that @entity90 is also happy to endorse , even within the walls of female oasis @entity40			1
" invariably in the evening , our members invite male partners in for drinks or an event or lectures , " @entity90 explained			0
" a lot of women love the fact that they have their own space during the day but it 's nice to have a mix of things			0
" it 's fine to invite the opposite sex in as guests -- it 's quite civilized as men and women do sit @entity331 -- but if the core of the club is also about single - sex , that 's fine too			1
" and if golf 's global organizers wanted to make a stand for equality they could always hold the men 's @entity13 at a ladies - only golf club			1
would n't that equal things out ? " @entity13 , held at a ladies club ? " @entity159 ponders incredulously			1
" it will never happen			0

@entity13 - one of golf 's four majors - starts thursday
the *decision* to hold the @entity13 at @entity11 has *attracted* criticism
@entity40 's @entity39 says there is a place for single - gender clubs
others argue future generations may see single - sex golf clubs as " pretty archaic "
