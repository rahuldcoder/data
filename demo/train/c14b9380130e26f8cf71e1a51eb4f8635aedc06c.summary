-- @entity1 sounds rather like a character straight out of the pages of a novel and , at times , his life has played out like one			1
he used to teach the " @entity8 " @entity8 how to ride a horse , while his first wife left him for his arch - rival on the three - day eventing circuit , @entity13			1
it is a career beset by tragedies too -- of riders and horses -- that made him think twice about climbing back into the saddle			1
but now happily married for a second time , the @entity19 has three children and a myriad of victories			0
at the age of 45 , the world @entity24 is still riding and is still desperately seeking that elusive olympic gold medal			1
" if i 'd won gold at @entity39 , it might have been different , " @entity28 , who won team silver at his home games , adding to the bronze he won in @entity34 four years earlier and another silver secured in @entity36 in 2004 , tells @entity0			1
" that would have been a good time to think i 'll kick back			0
but i 'm still living the dream over again			0
" of course , there 's the sense that i 've used up a lot of good luck in an obviously dangerous sport			1
but if you 're doing something you love , it 's worth the risk			1
" in the front of your mind , there 's that sense you could have a prang and end up in a mess			2
but this is a calculated risk			0
if your number is up crossing the road , riding a horse or getting in the car , that 's how it is			2
it certainly makes everything feel more fragile			0
" it is 23 years since @entity28 thought about walking away from the sport altogether			1
competing at the prestigious annual @entity73 event in the @entity74 , his mount @entity69 lost a shoe just before a fence , slipped , flipped over at the fence and had to be put down because of a broken neck			1
for all the bravado required for such a dangerous sport , @entity28 talks of that moment as though the emotional wounds are still raw			1
" i was really quite damaged by that , " he recalls			0
" i remember being very unsure whether i thought this was a good sport			2
i 've had some bad falls , times when i 've woken up in the air ambulance , i 've had friends that have died doing this			2
" and yes you do ask yourself , ' what on earth are you doing ? ' but if you 're going to break your neck , you might as well be doing something you love			0
thankfully i 'm still hanging in there			0
" this is not the rider nor family man brushing off the obvious repercussions of a fall , but rather the elite athlete in him knowing that he can not spend too much time dwelling on the what ifs of his sport			1
that sport reached its nadir in 1999 with five rider deaths in as many months , a period @entity28 described as a " freak year "			1
improvements in safety have steadily come into force in the proceeding 15 years , with collapsible fences and inflatable jackets for riders			0
but while @entity28 wants to be safe , he does not want to entirely eradicate the inherent dangers of horse and man riding over gargantuan fences , often at breakneck speeds			1
" i think there has to be an element of risk , otherwise no one would want to do it , " he explains			0
" it 's a bit like @entity130			2
i 'm sure the guys are the same before a race -- at the start of the cross-country i get that feeling in the pit of my stomach			0
it 's the excitement , the anticipation and the nerves			2
it 's a very raw feeling ahead of what you 're hoping to conquer			2
" the @entity19 , who was educated at @entity144 , where @entity145 @entity1 and @entity146 and @entity74 prime minister @entity147 among others attended , is bemused as to how he has made it to the pinnacle of his sport			1
modest to the core , he says : " i never thought this would happen			0
when i started competitively i was quite average			0
riding was just a family thing to do			0
" but that modest beginner has managed to become the golden boy of eventing , something which seemed to catch the attention of @entity8 when she was married to @entity161 and living in the @entity74			1
" well , i 'm not sure it was because of what i 'd achieved but just simple geography that she approached me -- she lived nearby with @entity161 , " @entity28 says			1
but how was it teaching the notoriously volatile " @entity8 " how to ride ? " it was a very enjoyable and surreal experience , " @entity28 , who taught her for two or three years , says			1
" when she arrived , no one could quite believe it was happening and there is something about her that 's quite extraordinary , but it was also all very normal , she was very normal			2
" horses are great releases for people and i think the riding was just that for her			2
needless to say she took it very seriously			0
she 's quite feisty and we had a few , how should i put it , heated debates about stuff			2
it was a fun time but it 's all in the past now			2
" similarly in the past is @entity28 's previous life with @entity186 , his first wife , who left him for @entity13 , the @entity188 horseman who is currently ranked second in the world			1
@entity28 , however , can now look back on the separation and laugh			1
" it was a bit like something out of @entity194 , " he says			0
" i can see people like to make a lot of the rivalry and that 's good for the sport			1
it adds an interesting twist to something that can often be dull i guess			0
" it 's someone that the media and people supporting make quite a hoodoo about and that can be quite tiring			2
everyone seems to have their team -- his or mine			0
i guess it 's fun for most people			0
" the relations between the pair are understandably still frosty because of their personal and professional lives , while there are few words exchanged between the two riders , except for the odd congratulations should one get the upper hand on the other			0
yet there is so much more to @entity28 than the remarkable horseman that he is			1
there is his indomitable mother , @entity226 , who spurred him on to ride and would not accept his occasional decisions to quit			0
there are the contradicting aspects of him -- that he is part of the bloodline of @entity233 , @entity74 prime minister in the 18th century , which contrast to the black eye he sported after sumo wrestling at his bachelor party , prior to his second marriage to the television presenter @entity239			1
but first and foremost , he is known for pulling off the ultimate equestrian juggling act , mastering the three complex disciplines of dressage , cross-country and show jumping			0
quite how much longer he will ride is a question he can not answer			0
@entity247 2016 is an obvious cut - off point but , then again , so was @entity249 2012			1
" i really had to do @entity249 -- if i had n't that would have been devastating -- and in many ways everything else is a bonus , " @entity28 adds			1
" it takes a long time in eventing to build up your business , horses and sponsors and to finally make some money			0
my horses would n't retire and i 'm not sure i could see someone else ride them			1
" i could do without the sick feeling in my stomach before a big event but i 'm not done yet			0
i 'm still having fun			0

@entity28 risks life and limb in his bid to remain the world 's no.1 three - day event rider
he has toyed with quitting the sport after the deaths of close friends and horses
when @entity8 lived in the @entity74 , he used to teach the " @entity8 " how to ride
his heart is now set on winning a so - far elusive olympic gold medal in 2016
