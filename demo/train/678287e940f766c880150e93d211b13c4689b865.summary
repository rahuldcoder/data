-- alarming findings related to women 's safety have come to light with the release of a @entity7 survey that looks at harassment on public transportation systems in the world 's largest cities			1
according to the new report , six in 10 women in major @entity14 cities report they 've been physically harassed while using transport systems , with @entity17 , @entity18 , found to have the most unsafe public transportation , followed by @entity20 and @entity21 , @entity22			1
at the other end of the safety spectrum , @entity23 was rated as the best of the 16 cities studied followed by @entity28 , the world 's largest capital with 38 million people , then @entity31 and @entity32			1
the poll was conducted in 15 of the world 's largest capitals , as well as @entity23 , the most populous city in the @entity36 , in collaboration with @entity39 polling company @entity38			2
here are the results , from ranked from worst to best : 1			0
@entity23 in total , 6,555 women and experts were surveyed			2
results are based on the respondents ' answers as well as surveys of experts in women 's rights , gender equality , urban planning and gender - friendly urban spaces in each of the cities			0
the @entity7 said polling could not be conducted in five other large capitals -- @entity69 , @entity71 ( @entity70 ) , @entity73 ( @entity72 ) , @entity74 and @entity75 -- due to conflict or an inability by polling company @entity38 to guarantee the necessary online sample of women			2
the group says it did survey 10 experts in @entity69 , the world 's fifth largest capital , but those findings were not included in the overall ranking as @entity38 could not carry out the public poll			0
had they been included , it would have put @entity69 in the top five most dangerous transport systems , said the @entity7			1
what constitutes harassment ? the foundation says the survey was conducted in many different cultures , and allowed respondents to judge what constituted harassment in their own society			0
women were asked six questions relating to : how safe they felt traveling alone at night ; the risk of being verbally harassed by men ; the risk of being groped or subjected to other forms of physical harassment ; trust that other passengers would assist a woman being physically or verbally abused ; and trust in authorities to investigate reports of sexual harassment or violence			2
have you been harassed ? share your experience in an open letter in @entity48 , respondents reportedly had little confidence that authorities would investigate an abuse report , while 85 % of @entity51 women doubted fellow public transport users would come to their rescue if they were in trouble			1
in an accompanying @entity127 report based on the survey , @entity122 , head of policy at the @entity124 , an @entity125 think tank , said it was worrying that women were scared to use public transport in some major cities and the poll highlighted the need for more action			1
" when there is not frequent , reliable , accessible transport , this can affect women and anyone 's ability to access opportunity and notably employment in urban areas , which can make a big difference for women in particular , " she said			0
" ( women ) tend to be more reliant on public transport and on non-motorized means , particularly in low - income or middle - income countries , in emerging economies			1
" women - only cars a short - term fix , say experts @entity28 's high standing may come as a surprise to those familiar with the highly publicized problems women have faced when riding @entity162 subways , with widespread reports of groping consistently making headlines			2
the @entity127 said experts attributed @entity28 's second place ranking to a raft of measures taken in the city over recent years to combat such incidents in often overcrowded buses and trains			0
these include the introduction of women - only trains in 2000 , which are color - coded in pink , and transit police to enforce rules			0
women - only sections on public transport are now also found in @entity42 , @entity45 , @entity41 , @entity69 and @entity50			1
@entity7 said other cities , including @entity32 , are considering this option and introducing cctv on platforms and improving lighting			1
however , gender and city planning experts have raised concerns over whether women - only transport is effective			0
@entity192 , senior transport specialist from the @entity193 , says they 're a short term fix and not a panacea for harassment of women			0
" the emerging interest in several countries on women - only initiatives should be seen as an opportunity for improving security in cities but not as a silver bullet for dealing with gender - based violence in transportation and urban settings , " @entity192 told the @entity7			1
" women - only initiatives are not likely to provide long - term solutions as they only segregate by gender and provide a short - term remedy instead of addressing more fundamental issues			0
" although experts remain critical of single - sex transport , most women favored the idea , according to the survey .			0
