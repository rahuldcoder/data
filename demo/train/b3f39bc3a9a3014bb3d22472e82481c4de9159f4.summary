-- @entity1 had lost his mind			1
what other explanation made sense , after the man chose the @entity6 when he might have been manager of the @entity7 ? the @entity6 ? that once - proud franchise had just suffered through its 18th straight losing season , a record for professional sports teams in @entity12 and perhaps any other continent			1
the @entity6 were a blight on the " city of champions			1
" kids were heading off to college with no memory of watching a winning baseball team			2
if you asked a @entity22 to talk @entity23 or @entity24 , he 'd stay all day			0
bring up the @entity6 , he 'd walk away			1
@entity25 : sports ' perennial losers the @entity6 were the taboo topic , the crazy uncle of the local sporting scene -- and there was zero hope of snapping the streak this season			1
this team was 57 - 105 last year			1
it had one of the worst pitching staffs of the modern era and was bringing back four of the five starting pitchers ! the big off season acquisitions in the field were journeymen @entity43 and @entity45			2
the payroll , as always , was going to be measured in pennies instead of dollars			0
yet , on november 15 , the day he was introduced to his new city , @entity1 , 53 , seemed downright jovial			1
either that , or downright delusional			0
" we 're going to get this done , " he said			0
" this is eventually going to turn			2
there 's no doubt in my mind that it 's going to turn			1
i wanted to get on board because i believe now is the time it 's going to start turning			1
" flash forward eight months , to wednesday morning on @entity64 's " @entity63 , " one the main thoroughfares leading to @entity66			1
in the midst of a wicked heat spell , fans were honking horns and waving brooms out their car windows -- and not because they wanted to sweep away the remnants of another lost season			2
rather , it was because the @entity6 -- the ' @entity76 ' or ' @entity6 ' in local parlance -- had a chance to sweep the defending @entity80 champion @entity81 in a three - game series and solidify their grip on first place			1
first place ? yes , the @entity6 have spent time there this late in a season for the first time since 1997			1
they own their best late - july record ( 51 - 45 ) since 1992			0
their 3 - 1 loss wednesday , which pushed them a half - game behind the @entity93 , hardly dampened the enthusiasm for this weekend 's series against superstar @entity96 and the @entity97			1
it is the most - anticipated series in the history of 10 - year - old @entity66 , widely regarded as the most beautiful ballpark in the major leagues			1
tickets remain only for sunday 's series finale			1
if this keeps up -- if the @entity6 somehow manage to make the playoffs -- it might well be the sport 's most unlikely story since the 1969 @entity7			1
the @entity109 had n't posted a single winning season before winning it all in ' 69			2
the @entity76 , with their $ 45 million payroll , have won series against the filthy rich @entity116 and @entity115 and are talking about adding players before @entity119 's july 31 trade deadline			1
they are doing this despite a spate of injuries that took away their top three catchers and their promising third baseman , @entity124			0
no wonder @entity125 and @entity25 have scheduled reporters to cover this weekend 's series			1
they will find all around them evidence of a deadened fan base sprung to life			0
@entity133 used to be one of the tortured fans			0
a @entity64 native , he is now the @entity6 ' second baseman and leads the team with 62 runs batted in			1
" what i 'm seeing more often is the 20 - something fan , young people at the ballpark who want to see us play , " @entity133 said			0
" a lot of people have said to a lot of us in here , ' thanks for making us @entity6 fans again			1
' " for old - time fans , the team 's resurgence has rekindled pleasant memories of the @entity157 titles of 1960 , ' 71 and ' 79 , part of a rich , 125 - history in the @entity80			1
the franchise has won five @entity157 in all and have produced iconic players such as @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164			0
@entity25 : everyone loves a @entity167 story ; this year baseball has two with attendance up nearly 20 % from last season , the @entity6 have a chance to attract 2 million fans for the first time since @entity66 opened			1
television ratings are up 66 % from july of last season and 40 % overall -- including three of the top 10 - rated games since 1994			2
the team soon will make its first appearances on national television since 2002			2
sports - talk radio 93.7 the fan is lined with @entity6 callers all day			1
sports merchandise stores are reporting unfathomable increases in @entity6 - related sales			2
@entity184 can tell you about that			0
he is the @entity187 - based owner of the @entity188 , a sports apparel shop across the street from @entity66			0
he has a similar store next to @entity192 in @entity187			0
he is giddy over the 51 % rise in @entity6 - related sales			2
" i wish we could turn @entity64 into the kind of atmosphere we have at @entity192 , " he said			1
" it helps if you have a good team , that 's for sure			2
" @entity1 , who managed the @entity200 to the @entity80 pennant in 2007 , ca n't go anywhere without people giving him advice			1
" i carry a notebook , " he says , laughing			0
previous managers carried only the pain of constant mockery amid another disastrous season			2
it 's a challenge trying to identify the low point of the 18 - year losing streak , which started the year @entity213 left for @entity214 as a free agent			1
there have been so many , including a ticket - price increase after the 100 - loss season that christened @entity66 ( season - ticket prices have not been raised since ) and the giveaway of homegrown third baseman @entity221 in 2003			2
but this one might top -- or bottom -- them all : the @entity6 flew in @entity64 - born actor @entity224 to throw out the ceremonial first pitch at their 2006 home opener , only to see him rip ownership at a pregame news conference			1
" i fear they will take advantage of the good will of the people who continue to show up , " @entity224 said that day			0
" for my money , that 's disrespectful			0
at some point , you either have to write the check or do something and not assume , well , we 're ok and ultimately the franchise is valuable anyway , like @entity240 did with the @entity241			0
" the way the @entity6 were going , the @entity241 should have been insulted at such comparisons			2
by 2007 , newspaper magnate @entity244 had replaced @entity245 as the club 's principal owner -- and principle villain			0
he was viewed as a cheapskate interested only in the bottom line			0
that perception has n't disappeared , but @entity244 began writing some significant checks shortly after he took control			0
the @entity6 have spent more on the amateur draft than any team in the majors over the past three years and have invested heavily in @entity257 , most prominently in the construction of a $ 5 million training academy in the @entity260			1
where once @entity244 was ridiculed on the streets , he now is praised			0
" i said last year that fans deserved to be angry ; i was angry , too , " @entity244 told the @entity266			0
" there 's nothing wrong with that			0
but i also can say that i believed from the beginning in the steps we were taking to restore championship - caliber baseball to @entity64			2
some of those have taken longer			0
some are starting to bear fruit			0
and many of them are n't even here yet			0
" meanwhile , general manager @entity280 and team president @entity281 engineered a complete overhaul after @entity284 hired them late in the 2007 season			1
" @entity295 , " as locals call it , has n't worked out perfectly , but @entity280 brought some critical pieces to @entity64 , including all - star closer @entity288 and starting pitchers @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity293 and @entity294			2
homegrown players such as center fielder @entity298 and @entity133 have begun to blossom			0
new pitching coach @entity299 has overseen a dramatic turnaround of the staff , the key component of the team 's resurgence			1
well , that and the hiring of @entity1 , who has created an atmosphere equal parts intense and relaxed			2
on one hand , @entity1 has not been afraid to instill discipline , such as when he benched the team 's best player , @entity298 , for failing to run out a dropped third strike			1
on the other , players will tell you @entity1 has made the game fun again			2
they know they wo n't be punished for mistakes of aggression , and they know @entity1 's personality will not change from day to day			1
he will be energized and approachable			0
decades in the game -- as a player , coach and manager -- have taught @entity1 that a 162 - game season is a marathon , not a sprint			1
" the attitude has changed , " @entity298 said			0
" we 've been pretty much neutral when it comes to winning and losing			0
we 're not down when we lose , and it 's not like we 're up that much when we win			0
we know what we have ahead of us			0
" if the season 's first four months are any indication , the @entity6 have ahead of them plenty of pressure - packed , fun - to - watch baseball			1
ask a @entity22 about that			0
he 'll talk all day .			0

the @entity6 are fighting for first place in the @entity339 's @entity80
they have endured 18 straight losing seasons and were not expected to do well this year
new manager @entity1 promised to turn the team around when he took over before this season
the @entity6 start a key series against the @entity97 *friday* in @entity64
