we 're used to seeing manufacturer tags that read " @entity3 , " " made in @entity0 " or " made in ... " just about anywhere on the globe			0
but this week , for the first time , an item can read " made in @entity8			0
" the @entity11 's @entity10 printer created the first object to be made in orbit on tuesday			1
the @entity15 space agency released a picture of astronaut @entity17 holding the newly printed piece , a white printer part emblazoned with the words " @entity21 " and " @entity22			1
" it 's not just a novelty			0
" there are many challenges about living and working in space , including when a part or a tool is broken or simply is not working correctly , and the spare part is 200 miles away , here on the surface of the @entity39 , " said @entity25 of @entity22 's @entity26 at @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29 , in a video posted on @entity22			1
" explorers traveling to @entity41 or to asteroids will face these same challenges , " but they wo n't be able to get goods from a resupply ship , he said			0
@entity22 's @entity11 @entity10 printer project manager @entity47 says it 's a historic achievement because it allows engineers " to e-mail our hardware to space instead of launching it			1
" humans on @entity41 by 2035 ? @entity22 's sci - fi dream could be reality " since the inception of the human space program , we have been completely dependent on launching every single thing we need from @entity39 to space , " said @entity47 in the video			1
@entity10 printers work by applying layer upon layer of heated plastic			0
but how do pieces made in space compare with those made on @entity39 ? do the layers bond differently without @entity39 's gravity ? that 's a question scientists hope to answer next year when the samples are returned to @entity39 on a @entity76 capsule			2
before the 3 - d printer flew to the space lab in september , the team printed a complete set of sample items here on @entity39 to be used as ground control samples			2
it 'll be an " apples - to - apples comparison , " said @entity22 's @entity47			0
" @entity21 " is n't just the printer faceplate 's manufacturing location			2
it 's the name of the @entity90 - based company that designed and built the space station 's @entity10 printer with @entity22 's guidance , and it was made in @entity8 engineers on the ground who commanded the printer for this week 's demonstration of @entity10 printing prowess in microgravity .			1

@entity11 's @entity10 printer has created the first object to be made in orbit
the object is a white printer part emblazoned with the words " @entity21 " and " @entity22 "
this could open up space travel as not every object used will need to be launched from @entity39
