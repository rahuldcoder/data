-- i met the original @entity2 when he was about halfway through his long life			1
at a conference of many fine artists and writers , @entity5 was indisputably " @entity9			1
" but in the late 1970s , when " @entity2 " was only 15 years old ( it is turning 50 soon ) , it was already , indisputably , a classic			2
but not just a classic of children 's books			2
it was a seminal book about childhood , and a journal of the life of an artist , and a clarion call for the satisfaction of those twin and opposite needs : independence and society			1
the man himself was small , compact , witty , intense			2
he was not above gossip ; he could be vindictive , salacious , morose and self - absorbed			2
but friends and admirers took all that in their stride			0
and he will be remembered for his uncompromising vision not about the sweetness of children -- their purity -- but about their complexity and wholeness as human beings			1
scholars suggest that in earlier centuries children were considered as deformed adults , more animal than angel			2
or they were perfect packaged gifts from heaven , @entity47 in glorious form , only to be corrupted by growing up			0
@entity5 stood up squarely in the middle of the last century , and he shouted both those inanities out the door			1
children are full humans , compromised only by their lack of vocabulary and practice in reporting how they live			1
but they live as fully as @entity5 himself lived right up to his last months and weeks and hours			1
news : author of " @entity2 " dies he leaves us with images of children flying to adventure and back again			2
@entity64 swooping out of his clothes into a basin of bread batter			0
@entity69 sailing to the wild rumpus " in and out of weeks and almost over a year			0
" using images and techniques inspired by @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and others , @entity5 interpreted the works of great masters : @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81			1
but he was never humbled by the association			0
no , their reputations were enhanced by his attention to them			0
the @entity88 ' link to @entity5 : @entity89 i knew him for about 35 years			1
as i turned from writing for children to writing for adults and began my novel " wicked , " i thought of how he never stopped yearning to make the next beautiful thing , the next meaningful page , even when his royalty checks piled up like oak leaves in the autumn around his country doorway			1
it was the work that counted , the chance of learning something new about himself			0
the chance of having something new to pass on to us			0
reaction : @entity5 sparked ' wild ' creativity in young readers were there time , i would write more ; but , you see , there are some books over there i need to look at again , more closely than before			1
i do not put them back on the shelves			0
there is no time for that kind of luxury			0
i need to remember , now , what he told us			0
meanwhile , as he passes away , some more sentimental scrap of me ( that he would have scorned ) hopes he is settling down to some nice bowl of chicken soup with rice with @entity130 or @entity81			0
though they have been impatient to meet him in person for a very long time , no doubt they 'll greet him as a fellow king			0
by now , @entity5 is finding his dinner waiting for him			1
and it is still hot			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity143			1

@entity143 says when he met him , @entity5 was clearly @entity9
he says his seminal book was many things but especially showed kids as full humans
he says @entity5 was complex ; had uncompromising *respect* for children
@entity143 : to the end , @entity5 never stopped yearning to make the next beautiful thing
