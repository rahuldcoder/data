-- for most of the year @entity2 's @entity1 , located on the south bank of the famous @entity4 , plays host to the world 's biggest music acts			1
but since 2009 , the venue has also spent one week in november staging tennis ' season - ending showpiece -- the @entity11			1
the event pits the world 's top eight male tennis players and doubles pairings against each other in a round - robin contest , with an unbeaten winner pocketing a check for $ 1.63 million			1
but before the elite of the game can do battle on the court , the @entity20 must be transformed from a concert venue to a world - class tennis facility			1
that 's where @entity11 tournament director @entity28 and his team come in			1
can @entity31 make @entity11 history ? " the build time that we have is very short , " @entity28 told @entity0			1
" @entity35 was here on tuesday night until midnight and we moved in at 1am in the morning on wednesday			1
" we had two days to turn the @entity1 from probably the greatest music venue in the world into the greatest sporting venue in the world			1
" the electric blue court , neon digital displays and dazzling lights give the 17,500 fans packed into the @entity20 an experience which is poles apart from the regal aura which surrounds the grass courts of @entity49 -- located just 10 miles away			1
" the @entity20 is pretty much a music venue , " explains @entity28			1
" laying the court might sound quite basic but it 's actually quite time consuming			2
" we stage it in a very different way			0
so there 's big screens , there 's light shows , lots of digital boarding around the court			2
" we build a 7,000 square meter fanzone , we also build a sponsors village with a practice court in the middle			0
so there 's a lot to do in a very short space of time			2
" the work done transforming the @entity20 is certainly appreciated by the fans who flock to the week - long tournament			1
the 2010 event saw over 250,000 spectators come to see the action across the seven days of competition			2
@entity76 fan @entity75 was taking in the action on thursday and was struck by the transformation the venue had undergone			0
" it 's my first time here at the @entity20 ( watching tennis ) but i 've been to music gigs here , " he said			1
" it 's completely transformed with the tennis memorabilia , practice courts and fan zones			0
normally it 's an empty space			0
" @entity90 spectator @entity89 was also impressed with the arena , saying it surpassed previous tennis experiences in his homeland			0
" it 's my first time here , " he said			0
" i 've been to the @entity97 tournament before , i prefer this			0
the size of the @entity20 is a lot bigger and better			1
they 've got restaurants , it 's really spacious and there 's a lot more to do			0
" prior to the event moving to @entity2 in 2009 , @entity106 served as the location for what was then called the @entity11			1
@entity28 explained how the timing was perfect for the @entity20 to take on the mantle from the @entity113 city			2
" the chairman of the @entity11 was looking where to take it from @entity106 and decided bringing it to the @entity118 , and @entity2 , was a good move			1
the @entity20 was just about to be opened ; it was a perfect synergy to match the two together			2
" in addition to giving tennis a futuristic face - lift , @entity28 also believes hosting the @entity11 at a venue such as the @entity20 opens the sport up to a wider audience			1
" where the @entity20 has been so successful is the acts that they 've had over the years has made this venue a destination venue in it 's own right , " he said of the arena which has been converted from the @entity129 attraction			1
" so what we 've managed to create here is almost attracting a new audience to tennis that historically maybe could n't get tickets to @entity140 and @entity49			0
people who had maybe never seen live tennis before			0
so we 've got the core tennis fans and we 've got sporting fans who are seeing the game for the first time			0
" @entity147 is the tennis correspondent for @entity118 newspaper @entity148			0
he is full of praise for the show put on by the @entity20 , saying the way in which tennis has flourished at the arena is reminiscent of when the finals were played at @entity156 's @entity155 between 1977 and 1989			1
" to my mind it 's a very natural venue for tennis , much like @entity155 was in terms of an indoor venue , " said @entity147			2
" the way it 's set up , the way the tennis court itself is spot - lighted ... there are certain places you feel tennis was made for and i think this is definitely one of them			2
" @entity147 is also convinced the event is creating new fans for the sport , with tickets more obtainable than they are for one of the tennis ' four grand slams			0
" very few people get to go to @entity49			0
here , there 's more of a sense of the general population getting in and being able to feel the pulse of the sport			0
" to get that close to @entity31 and @entity183 is something special			0
the whole thing is designed to draw people into the sport and i think that 's what we need to do			0
" it 's not a surprise to me that places like @entity155 , like the @entity20 , although they are ostensibly concert venues , with a bit of imagination , a bit of thought and a bit of foresight , can be transformed into great sporting venues			1
" the @entity20 's deal to host the @entity11 expires in 2013 , with the @entity11 yet to make a decision on where the event will move onto next			1
wherever the tournament ends up , @entity147 believes the @entity1 has raised the bar and helped increase tennis ' global profile			2
" it 's setting a benchmark ; the next venue has got to step up			2
when it moves from here , and i 'm sure it will because the message of tennis has to be global , it 's going to be a very tough act to follow			0
" everywhere across the world we have to portray the message that tennis is a superb sport to come and watch , but very few do it as well as this			0

since 2009 , @entity2 's @entity1 has hosted the @entity11
the event is played out between world 's top - ranked male singles and doubles stars
the @entity20 is *predominantly* a music venue , playing host to artists like @entity35
the @entity1 's deal to host season - ending event runs until 2013
