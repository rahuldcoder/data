-- a confession : i usually have a knee - jerk reaction when television goes into its extreme - weather mode			1
all too often , i 've seen the machinery clank into action -- team coverage , breathless anchors , intrepid correspondents getting soaked in the rain -- only to watch the heavily hyped storms peter out			1
what used to be the province of local eyewitless news , gearing up at the merest threat of thunderstorms or snowfall , long ago became a cable news specialty			1
it 's a surefire way to goose the ratings			1
when i was in @entity24 for the @entity26 convention in august , the saturation coverage of @entity23 helped force organizers to cancel the first night			1
then @entity23 turned out to be a bust , but the storm coverage continued to compete with the convention right up until @entity30 argued with his chair			1
and i found myself grateful for the television coverage , as messy and chaotic as it often is			1
that is because the weaknesses of live , breaking news can sometimes be its strength			1
when news organizations jump the gun in reporting , for example , a @entity45 decision , or an ailing person 's death , it 's hard to understand why they could n't wait a few more minutes to get it right -- why the rush to get it first can trump all else			1
watch : why @entity50 in the rain ? but when a monster storm is devastating the @entity55 , the fragmentary reports and incremental information are both riveting and necessary			2
even a mistake becomes more understandable in this context			2
( a @entity0 meteorologist cited an erroneous posting from a @entity61 bulletin board monday night that the @entity62 was filled with three feet of water ; the network quickly issued an on - air correction			0
) the correspondents braving the elements seemed less like grandstanders and more like dogged fact - finders			0
each development -- " landfall near @entity71 ! " " @entity72 down in @entity73 ! " " flooding in @entity74 ! " -- became part of a shared community experience			0
at least for those who still had power			0
watch : is @entity32 's dominant coverage hurting @entity80 ? and that , even in this age of media fragmentation , may be cable tv 's greatest service			1
we watch and experience the highs and lows together , even those in parts of the country that are unaffected			0
it is the polar opposite of a presidential campaign , with its relentless hyper - partisanship			2
in fact , by upending the final week of the campaign , the hurricane and the media attention surrounding it provided a uniquely unifying moment			1
@entity99 in @entity100 : still stripping during @entity32 social media played a key role as well			2
on @entity106 , the photo - sharing app , users were posting 10 @entity32 photos every second -- more than 244,000 tagged # sandy by monday afternoon			0
no news organization could beat that			2
@entity110 exploded with messages and updates about the hurricane , along with expressions of concern			0
for the 140 - character generation , it was the online equivalent of gathering around the tv set in the pre-internet days			2
but the vulnerability of social media , with its lack of editors or grownup supervision , was on display as well			2
the web , especially @entity126 and @entity110 , also were flooded with fake photos -- stock images that had been altered or were misrepresented as having been taken during @entity32			0
one picture , carried by the @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 , showed sentinels guarding the @entity134 ; it turned out to be have been taken last month			0
editors at @entity137 's @entity136 asked readers to help them spot the bogus shots by using the @entity110 hashtag # @entity140			0
watch : many americans think @entity143 is @entity144 ? oy			0
journalism , to be sure , is better at quick snapshots than long - term probing			0
since the candidates have scarcely talked about climate change , it has almost disappeared from the media radar screen			0
but the violent storms of recent years -- the @entity152 , the derecho , now the most far - ranging hurricane in modern memory -- suggest that we have plunged into a new and more dangerous era			0
reporters need to be more aggressive in examining the role of environmental change in these superstorms			0
i still think there is a tendency , in the wake of @entity166 , to cast every storm as a potential category 5 killer			1
but given the magnitude of @entity32 , which killed at least 33 people in the @entity173 and knocked out power to more than 7.5 million , the media hype was more than justified			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			1

@entity177 : tv coverage of storms is sometimes *overblown* , *designed* to goose ratings
he says tv news can jump gun , get facts *wrong* , but in weather *disaster* it 's understandable
*viewers* ravenous for *details* , he says . storm brought unifying moment in midst of campaign
@entity177 : after @entity166 , media cover every storm like it 's huge ; in this case that was justified
