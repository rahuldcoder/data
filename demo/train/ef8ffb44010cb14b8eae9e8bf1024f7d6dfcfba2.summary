-- you 've likely heard of a " flesh - eating bacteria " hitting @entity3 and other states this summer			2
while the bacteria are real , public health officials say the " flesh - eating " part is not			2
@entity8 vulnificus is a naturally occurring bacterium that lives in warm saltwater and infects humans through the consumption of undercooked shellfish and skin wounds			1
four infections have been reported in @entity18 so far this year , along with 13 in @entity3 , six in @entity19 and 10 in @entity20			2
in extreme cases , the bacteria can lead to blood infections ( half of which are fatal , according to the @entity26 ) , possible amputation and blistering skin lesions			1
only bacteria classified as group a strep are technically " flesh - eating , " says @entity33 , a medical epidemiologist in the @entity26 's @entity34 , @entity35 , and @entity36			1
the dozen species of @entity8 bacterium known to cause disease in humans are not in this group but do account for an estimated 80,000 illnesses , 500 hospitalizations and 100 deaths each year in the @entity46			1
the difference is that flesh - eating bacteria attack the bands of tissue that surround muscles , nerves , fat and blood vessels			1
@entity8 vulnificus , on the other hand , gets into the blood stream from either the skin or intestinal tract , and can damage organs and cause skin lesions that may appear similar to the skin damage caused by strep a , @entity33 says			1
@entity8 vulnificus multiplies in warmer water temperatures and tends to reach peak levels in midsummer , according to @entity33 , so the higher bacteria count coincides with the height of beach season			1
this adds to the public 's fear of the bacteria			0
after all , no one wants to get a limb amputated while on vacation			0
" the important thing to remember is that these infections are rare , " @entity33 says			1
the @entity26 estimates that nationwide there are 95 @entity8 vulnificus cases each year , including 85 hospitalizations and 35 deaths			1
and typically the bacteria are only a summer health hazard , with 85 % of infections occurring between may and october			2
most at risk for severe illness and death from @entity8 vulnificus are people with a weakened immune system or who suffer from chronic liver disease , @entity33 says			1
milder symptoms caused by this bacteria include diarrhea , vomiting and stomach pain			2
some people might not show any signs of infection			0
two parasites found in contaminated water , @entity100 and @entity101 , can also cause similar symptoms , according to the @entity105			0
still , shooting that raw oyster or cutting your foot on a shell during your beach vacation should n't be taken lightly			0
if you experience symptoms a few hours or days after eating shellfish or being exposed to coastal water , seek medical attention immediately			1
" rapid treatment is really critical , " @entity33 says			0
" if someone is eating raw oysters , especially in a high - risk group , or is swimming in the ocean and notices skin lesions that are worsening quickly , it is important to get early treatment			1
mortality rates increase if treatment is n't started on the first day of symptoms			0
" for those concerned about the safety of their summer vacation spot , states that typically report the most infections are @entity3 , @entity18 and @entity19			0
in 2013 , the @entity3 @entity130 reported 11 deaths and 41 infections			0
@entity18 reports 15 to 30 annual cases , while @entity19 state officials say they see an average of 25 infections per year			0
@entity137 took action in 2003 to reduce health risks by implementing a regulation to restrict the sale of raw oysters harvested from the @entity143 during warmer months when the bacteria count tends to be higher			0
in a review published in 2013 by @entity26 and the @entity147 , researchers found that this action was strongly correlated with the reduction of deaths and illness			0
@entity33 says based on the data , it can be assumed that oysters harvested in the @entity155 between april and october have the highest levels of the bacteria			0
in addition to avoiding raw oysters , the @entity26 also recommends wearing gloves when handling raw shellfish and thoroughly cooking it , and discarding closed - shell varieties that do n't open after cooking			2
for visitors to the beach or bay , if you have an open wound or broken skin , avoid exposure to warm salt or brackish water if you 're in a high - risk group			1
