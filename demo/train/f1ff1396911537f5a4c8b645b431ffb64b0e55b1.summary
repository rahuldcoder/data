-- men sprawled on a tile floor , shirtless and convulsing			2
children , too , seemingly unable to control their shaking and flailing			2
panic and screams in the background			2
these are some of the hard - to - stomach images that the @entity10 administration has shown a select group of senators in closed - door briefings to make the case that a limited military attack on @entity16 is justified			1
@entity0 was the first to obtain the 13 different videos seen by members of the @entity19 that depict the gruesome scene of an chemical weapons attack in @entity16 on august 21			1
the administration told senators that their authenticity was verified by the intelligence community			2
the attack , allegedly carried out by @entity16 forces under president @entity28 , has touched off the most critical foreign policy question since the uprising began in 2011 : is a military response merited ? the videos capture a moment of panic , as those who are standing try to feed water to those who appear incapacitated			1
what is sarin ? many of the videos were previously posted on @entity44 , but this collection of footage is significant because the intelligence community has given it a stamp of authenticity			1
the footage could be vital in the administration 's quest to convince @entity54 and the @entity56 public that the @entity56 must launch punitive strikes against @entity16 , former @entity50 ambassador @entity50 said			2
" that video will sensitize the @entity56 people that this is n't just an intervention , that this is a military strike to stop that type of atrocity , " the former congressman told @entity0			1
while the videos are hard to watch , they do not prove who is responsible for the attack , nor do they provide an answer for whether military strikes are the correct course			1
president @entity10 favors limited intervention , and his administration has been working nonstop to convince allies in @entity74 and lawmakers back home for support			0
hours after @entity0 obtained and broadcast portions of the videos , the @entity19 posted them on its website for public viewing			1
an aide to @entity83 , the committee 's chairwoman , said it 's expected the video will be played monday at a briefing for all @entity89 members			1
secretary of state @entity90 , defense secretary @entity91 and national security adviser @entity92 will be among those representing the @entity10 administration at that hearing and one wednesday for senators , according to the @entity89			1
based on her attendance at closed - door briefings , @entity83 has decided to vote in favor of the measure to intervene militarily in @entity16 , defying the wishes of many of her constituents			0
" what 's coming in is overwhelmingly negative , " @entity83 said thursday about the feedback from voters			0
" there 's no question about that			0
but you see , then they do n't know what i know			0
" the availability of these videos obtained by @entity0 means that anyone can see at least part of the administration 's evidence and come to their own conclusions			1
one video shows a room with enough children to fill a classroom , but they are arranged on the ground , the bright colors of their shirts -- red , yellow , green , purple , blue -- contrasting the paleness of their dead bodies			0
there were dead adults placed in this space , too			0
the video captures at least six rows of adults with no less than four bodies each			0
sheets and blankets cover some of the bodies			0
in another video , a man uses a manual resuscitator on a toddler , who appears motionless			0
another man comes with a bottled water and the men together try to rinse the small boy 's face			0
it looks like the boy 's chest moves , but his arms remain pinned to his side like a soldier at attention			0
@entity0 can not independently confirm the authenticity of the videos			1
but officials have a number of reasons as to why they believe they are authentic			0
the videos were shot from multiple angles , providing overlap , not just in what could be seen but what could be heard , the administration officials told the senators			2
why use chemical weapons ? @entity0 's @entity175 contributed to this report .			1

new : the @entity19 posted the videos on its website
new : they *'ll* likely be shown to @entity89 members monday , a congressional aide says
the videos first obtained by @entity0 show the *aftermath* of a chemical attack
they are hard to watch , but do not prove who was behind the attack
