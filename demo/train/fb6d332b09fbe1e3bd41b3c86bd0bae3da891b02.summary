@entity0 is at it again			2
this time , the controversial @entity3 artist - activist has taken his first venture into music , releasing a heavy metal single and music video inspired by his harrowing detention by the government two years ago			1
a perpetual thorn in the @entity3 government 's side , @entity0 , whose projects have spanned art installations , film , photography , writing , and architecture , was en route to @entity20 in april 2011 when he was taken into custody at @entity23 's international airport			1
he was detained for 81 days amid a government crackdown on political activists , widely believed to stem from government fears of a potential uprising inspired by the @entity28			0
upon his release , @entity0 was subjected to severe restrictions on his movements and later accused of tax evasion -- charges which he rejected and unsuccessfully challenged in court			0
entitled " @entity41 , " the five - minute music video features the burly , bearded artist recreating his time in jail to expletive - laden lyrics denouncing government repression			1
" the idea ( for this song ) first came to me while i was in detention and the guards watching me quietly inquired if i could sing , " @entity0 told @entity42			2
" that was when i realized that both the guards and i were being detained ; in their three years in the army , they had never been allowed to leave this place			0
" " for young people around the ages of 19 - 20 , music can spark their imagination and passion , and this small incident moved me			0
after i was released , i thought i should write my own song , " he added			0
@entity0 penned the lyrics to " @entity41 , " while rock musician @entity59 composed the music and @entity62 's @entity61 directed the video 's cinematography			1
@entity0 said the dark visuals , from the artist being taken into jail with a black hood to being perpetually accompanied by two guards while eating , sleeping , and using the bathroom , mirrored his ordeal			2
some of his jabs at government repression in the video materialize in defiant fantastical elements , such as the river crabs scampering over the toilet ( " hexie " is a pun for " harmonization " -- a government euphemism for societal repression ) and the horse sitting in for the artist bound to a chair ( " caonima " is a pun for cursing someone 's mother )			1
@entity0 said the " dumbasses " and " f * * kers " he denounced in his lyrics also refer to scholars and intellectuals in @entity3 who " do n't have a clear understanding of @entity3			2
despite going through so many disasters , they are still deluded			0
" in one scene , the artist 's head is shaved by a child -- a reference to his then two - year - old son whom @entity0 said he constantly thought of during his detention and whom he feared would no longer recognize him by the time he was released			1
he said the song may help him overcome the trauma of his detention , which he described as " extremely difficult			0
" at the same time , he said he has no regrets over his actions , believing that people have a responsibility to bring hope and warmth into the world -- and that as an artist , he has certain platforms of expression that he should use to this end			0
" many people are still imprisoned , many for much longer ( than me ) because we all expressed a difference of opinion and were accused of incitement to subvert state power , " he added			0
" so i have to speak out for them			0
" meanwhile , the artist addressed another pressing problem in @entity3 -- mainland chinese , spooked by a scandal over melamine - tainted baby milk formula , have snapped up tins in @entity20 , leading to a public outcry over the resulting shortage and the institution of a two - can ( 1.8 kg ) cross-border limit in march by the city 's authorities			1
" @entity146 " debuted at a @entity20 exhibition friday -- a 10 meter by 8 meter map of @entity3 created with 1,815 tins of various brands of baby formula			1
" although @entity3 's economy is developing , @entity3 's food products and the environment have already been completely sacrificed because of deteriorating ethics , " @entity0 said			2
he described the situation of people needing to seek milk formula outside their own country to feed their children as " absurd			2
" while @entity0 professed no solutions , saying that the purpose of art is raise questions , he said the problem of milk formula should be resolved by the people rather than through harsh legal measures			1
" it shows that the ' one country , two systems ' [ policy ] is extremely contradictory and difficult to coordinate , " he added			0
" @entity41 " is one of six songs on the topic of @entity0 's detention -- the rest will be released next month as part of an album based on his personal experiences .			1
