-- you 're on a bus to @entity3 and the cute blond girl in the third row breaks out into a rendition of " @entity7			0
" you have two options : you can stare at her awkwardly or pretend you 're @entity10 and lend your vocals to the chorus			0
it 's scenes like this one , which opens @entity17 's new film " @entity20 , " based on the rock opera of the same name , that have audiences split on movie musicals			1
formerly a surefire moneymaker , the genre has become more accustomed to sporadic success in recent years			1
still , studios recreate such musicals , hoping for " @entity31 's " box office numbers and " @entity30 's " critical acclaim			1
boasting names like @entity33 and @entity34 , nostalgic rock anthems and ' 80s flair , " @entity20 " will prevail if audiences are in on the joke , said @entity39 , the founding editor of @entity40			1
director @entity17 appears to agree with @entity41			0
" the period sort of makes fun of itself in its own way because it was a really wonky sort of boundaryless time , " @entity17 , who directed , produced and choreographed the film , told @entity43			2
" i wanted to make sure the comedy and emotion were coming from the characters and not from their wigs or costumes , that they were n't always chasing the joke of the era			2
" big hair and fanny packs aside , musicals have a hard enough time appealing to mainstream audiences			1
" at a certain point , people lost the ability to ... imagine a realistic story being told through music and dance , " @entity39 said , noting theatrical underachievers like 1967 's " @entity62 , " 1968 's " @entity63 ! " and 1969 's " hello , @entity64 ! " " movies have become so literal , " he added			2
some people respond better to " things that are sort of in quotes			0
it has to have an element of reality			0
" despite @entity17 's success with 2007 's " @entity80 , " which grossed more than $ 118 million domestically , he said : " i really worry about losing money for people and hurting people 's careers , and ( ' @entity20 ' ) was a really big gamble			1
" but the director said he was comforted by @entity33 's enthusiasm and hard work as rock star @entity20			1
@entity33 has said he spent about five hours a day training for the role , and it 's a good thing , because @entity93 , a @entity94 professor of statistics , said the " mission : impossible " actor 's performance could potentially be a big draw			2
people will be intrigued to see a star in this role who is n't usually associated with singing and dancing , said @entity93 , who co-wrote a recent study titled " @entity106			0
" then there 's @entity34 , who won an @entity108 for her role as @entity110 in " @entity30			1
" @entity93 's research says musicals last much longer than other types of productions on @entity115			1
that might play into @entity118 's motivation for adapting such stories			2
if a @entity115 show that costs $ 350 for a family of four in @entity94 can be successful , @entity93 reasoned , why would n't a movie version , that costs about $ 45 for that same family , do well ? that said , " you get less of the spectacular aspect in the movies than you do in the theater , " he said			2
" music is playing , dancing is going on , and you really feel it a lot more than you do on the movie screen			0
... movie musicals do get hurt by that			1
" on @entity115 , " there 's that suspension of disbelief that you go in with , " @entity93 added			0
" you know it 's on a stage			0
when you watch a movie , there 's still some suspension of disbelief , but it feels more jarring when people suddenly burst into song			1
" in other words , the fact that the actors in " @entity20 " are constantly reacting to musical numbers could work in the film 's favor			1
some people might find it odd if @entity155 , played by @entity156 , was sitting on a bus singing and nobody around her seemed to notice , @entity39 said			0
most of the musicals that have done well at the box office of late have used a mix of dialogue and music to move a story along , much like " @entity20			1
" so it will be interesting to see how " @entity168 © rables , " a fully sung musical , performs at the box office when it opens in december , @entity41 added			1
the " @entity20 " movie soundtrack , which debuted at no. 15 on the @entity171 , and no. 1 on the soundtrack chart , will likely have a better week after the film opens , said @entity175 , a senior correspondent at @entity171			1
soundtracks are n't huge moneymakers anymore , @entity175 said			0
" @entity178 , " which earned @entity179 the @entity180 for best compilation soundtrack for a motion picture in 2005 , was " the last , sort of , collection of music by artists that would ... greatly enhance the value of a film			0
" even the " @entity80 " soundtrack debuted on the @entity171 at no. 20 before peaking at no. 2			0
but " @entity20 " is driven by ' 80s hits like " @entity192 , " " @entity193 " and " @entity194			0
" " ' @entity20 ' is filled with 11 o'clock numbers , " @entity175 said			0
get ready to start singing on that bus			0
