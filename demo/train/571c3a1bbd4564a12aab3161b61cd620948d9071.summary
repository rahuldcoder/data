-- @entity1 crossed his party again on immigration			2
the potential 2016 presidential contender from @entity5 was one of 11 @entity7 senators joining most democrats to support a procedural vote this week on legislation aimed at stemming the tide of immigrant children crossing the southern border			1
the vote for the $ 2.7 billion @entity8 bill aimed at meeting needs of the immigrant families in the surge and kids who arrived on their own , simply allowed lawmakers to begin debate on the measure			0
but it 's significant as the @entity8 needed the lofty threshold of 60 votes to move on to the border package that is in line with their priorities and basically those of the @entity31 although it would spend $ 1 billion less than what president @entity32 wants			1
most in @entity1 's caucus opposed , including fellow potential @entity31 hopefuls @entity36 of @entity37 and @entity38 of @entity39			1
and it all took place as @entity31 leaders reworked their version in an uncertain bid to attract conservative support to address the situation most consider a humanitarian crisis			1
the @entity1 vote carries unique significance for him , regardless of the proposal 's outcome			2
that 's because his aspirations for higher office took a big hit in the @entity7 over his central role in drafting and then voting for comprehensive immigration reform last summer			0
he later moved away from the legislation , but it was too late , politically			0
vocal and influential conservatives panned the measure over their claims it would not secure the southern border and would only create amnesty for some 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the country			2
the legislation stalled in the @entity7 - led @entity31 , as did @entity1 's standing with the right wing of the party			1
conservative views are paramount in the presidential nominating contest , and they simply did n't like what the son of @entity77 immigrants had done			0
@entity79 votes to start debate on emergency border bill so after all that , and a lot of effort since to rebuild his standing with conservatives , why did he cast his lot with @entity8 on an immigration vote again ? " i voted to move to the @entity79 border bill so that we would have the opportunity to vote on and pass amendments that would achieve real reforms , " @entity1 wrote in a statement			1
he also said he would not support a final bill unless the @entity8 - led chamber did two things that @entity7 want : change a 2008 law to make it easier to deport young migrants from @entity103 as a deterrent and toss parts of an @entity32 administration program that eases deportation of other immigrants in the @entity109 illegally			0
most @entity8 do n't want either change , but @entity7 blame the influx of young immigrants from @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 on what they contend are flawed immigration policies			0
the message , they say intended or not , is that it 's easier to immigrate			0
this is the first time in the border crisis debate that @entity1 has inserted himself in a significant way			1
while he has given numerous interviews about the nearly 60,000 minors -- many of them unaccompanied -- who have crossed the border in the past 10 months , he has not been instrumental in crafting emergency legislation in @entity128 to address it			2
@entity1 's vote on wednesday certainly carries some risk , judging by conservative responses to more @entity7 - friendly legislation in the @entity31			1
@entity133 , editor of the conservative blog @entity135 , wrote thursday that the slimmed down , $ 659 million @entity31 proposal is actually " inexcusable			0
" his problem with it is that it gives money to @entity32 to disperse to border and other immigration programs without imposing the changes to immigration policy @entity7 want immediately			0
@entity38 convinces @entity31 to alter border bill while @entity1 's willingness to move forward could be unpopular among conservatives , enough lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers are concerned about leaving town friday for the month of august without doing anything about the border crisis			1
@entity31 members and senators will be spend the rest of the summer amid constituents back home where polls show immigration overall is especially on the minds of voters			2
in a recent @entity0 / @entity164 survey , 39 % say it 's extremely important for @entity32 and @entity128 to deal with illegal immigration in general , up 10 points from last year			0
" that means that immigration is the only issue tested that has grown significantly more important to the public in the past year , " @entity0 polling director @entity168 said			0
@entity31 @entity7 seeks cover with slimmer border bill @entity0 's @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 contributed to this report .			1

sen. @entity1 was one of 11 *republicans* to back a procedural vote on the border crisis
fellow potential 2016 contenders , sens. @entity38 and @entity36 , opposed it
the @entity31 reworked its bill to *appease* conservatives
though it 's not clear whether @entity128 will work out a *compromise*
