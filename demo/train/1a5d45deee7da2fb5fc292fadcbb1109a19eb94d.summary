a former @entity3 agent who went missing in @entity4 was working for the @entity5 there , not conducting private business as officials have previously claimed , the @entity0 and the @entity1 reported on thursday			1
both the @entity8 and @entity10 's family have long denied he was working for the @entity12 government when he disappeared on a trip to @entity4 in 2007			1
but thursday 's reports from the @entity1 and the @entity0 claim that @entity15 had been on a @entity5 mission to dig up information			1
a source who 's involved in the matter told @entity20 that there 's proof that @entity15 worked for the @entity5 undercover and under contract while also working as a private investigator			2
the @entity0 says it decided to move forward with publishing the sensitive story after holding off several times			2
" the @entity0 first confirmed @entity15 's @entity5 ties in 2010 and continued reporting to uncover more details			1
it agreed three times to delay publishing the story because the @entity12 government said it was pursuing promising leads to get him home , " the news agency said in its report			1
" the @entity0 is reporting the story now because , nearly seven years after his disappearance , those efforts have repeatedly come up empty			0
the government has not received any sign of life in nearly three years			0
top @entity12 officials , meanwhile , say his captors almost certainly already know about his @entity5 association			1
" @entity20 's source , who declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the investigation , said that after six and half years in captivity and interrogations , it 's more than likely that @entity15 's captors know he was working undercover			0
" the family is aware of the risk created by this story and are praying for his safety , as they have for six years , " a @entity15 family spokesman told @entity20 thursday night			0
" all they want is to bring @entity63 home			0
" in a written statement , the family criticized the @entity12 government 's response to the situation			1
" @entity63 is a courageous man who has dedicated himself , including risking his own life , in service to the @entity12 government			1
but the @entity12 government has failed to make saving this good man 's life the priority it should be			1
there are those in the @entity12 government who have done their duty in their efforts to find @entity63 , but there are those who have not , " the statement said			1
" it is time for the @entity12 government to step up and take care of one of its own			1
after nearly 7 years , our family should not be struggling to get through each day without this wonderful , caring , man that we love so much			0
" officials contacted by @entity20 on thursday declined to comment on any alleged ties between @entity15 and the @entity12 government			1
" we have no comment on any purported affiliation between mr. @entity10 and the @entity94 , " @entity5 spokesman @entity91 said			2
" the @entity12 government remains committed to bringing him home safely to his family			1
" @entity98 spokeswoman @entity97 criticized the @entity0 for publishing the story and said it " does nothing to further the cause of bringing him home			0
" " without commenting on any purported affiliation between mr. @entity10 and the @entity12 government , the @entity104 and others in the @entity94 strongly urged the @entity0 not to run this story out of concern for mr. @entity10 's life , " she said			1
" we regret that the @entity0 would choose to run a story that does nothing to further the cause of bringing him home			0
the investigation into mr. @entity10 's disappearance continues , and we all remain committed to finding him and bringing him home safely to his family			2
" other detained @entity12 @entity0 : ' one of the biggest scandals in recent @entity5 history ' the agent - turned - security - consultant was last heard from on march 8 , 2007 , when he checked into a hotel on @entity4 's @entity119 and then checked out to return to the @entity12 the next day			1
from the start , the @entity5 and the @entity8 denied there were any government ties to @entity15 's trip			1
and @entity15 's family said he had been in @entity4 on private business investigating cigarette smuggling			2
but the @entity1 and @entity0 reports differ sharply from public government descriptions			1
after @entity15 's disappearance , the @entity1 and @entity0 reported , @entity5 officials initially downplayed his ties with the agency and said he did not go to @entity4 for the agency			1
" but months after @entity15 's abduction , e-mails and other documents surfaced that suggested he had gone to @entity4 at the direction of certain @entity5 analysts who had no authority to run operations overseas , " the @entity1 story says , citing officials			1
" that revelation prompted a major internal investigation that had wide - ranging repercussions at @entity149			0
" the @entity0 's story describes the situation as " one of the biggest scandals in recent @entity5 history			2
" according to the reports , the @entity5 changed how analysts work with contractors as a result			0
and the agency paid $ 2.5 million to @entity15 's family , the @entity1 and @entity0 said			1
source : @entity5 apologized to family @entity20 's source said that @entity163 , a family friend who used to be a federal prosecutor in @entity165 , helped find the documents that proved @entity15 's @entity5 connection			1
ever since @entity15 's disappearance , @entity168 had been trying to do whatever he could to locate his friend			0
with the help of his paralegal , @entity168 found e-mails exchanged between a @entity5 analyst and @entity15			0
the e-mails discussed @entity15 's 2007 trip to @entity4 , the source said			2
and more importantly , they revealed the trip had a @entity5 connection , as the @entity0 and the @entity1 reported			1
@entity168 took the e-mails to the @entity185 and to sen. @entity186 from @entity15 's home state of @entity165 , a committee member at the time , the source said			0
at first , the source said , the @entity5 denied any involvement			2
" as a result of the documents , they conducted an investigation and discovered it was true , " the source said			0
a @entity5 representative asked to meet @entity15 's family in @entity198 , @entity165 , the source said , and " personally apologized on behalf of the @entity5			1
" @entity168 met with the @entity5 and negotiated a $ 2.5 million settlement with @entity15 's family to fend off a lawsuit , the source told @entity20			1
but all the while , in public statements , the @entity12 government continued to deny any ties between @entity15 and the @entity5 -- work that , according to the @entity0 and @entity1 reports , was done off the books			1
as a results of the investigation , three @entity5 employees were fired and seven others were disciplined , the source said			2
at least two of the three people fired have been rehired by other government agencies , a source told @entity20 , confirming information first reported by the @entity0 " they fired their own people and then took care of them , " the source said			2
the @entity222 opened a criminal investigation into the matter , according to the source			0
so far , the source said , no one has been charged			0
@entity222 spokesman @entity228 declined to comment			0
where is @entity15 ? @entity15 's whereabouts remain unclear			0
during an exclusive interview with @entity20 's @entity233 in september , @entity4 president @entity231 offered little when asked what he could tell @entity15 's family			2
" we do n't know where he is , who he is , " @entity231 said			0
" he is an @entity12 who has disappeared			0
we have no news of him			0
" in 2011 , the @entity8 said new evidence suggested that @entity15 , who has diabetes and high blood pressure , was alive and being held somewhere in southwest @entity245			0
this year , a source with knowledge of the investigation told @entity20 , " we have every reason to believe that he 's alive and that the @entity4 control his fate			2
" last month , @entity15 became the longest held @entity12 hostage in history			0
at the time , @entity15 's family members told @entity20 's @entity255 that they were worried because they have n't had any word since they received five photos in 2011			0
the pictures show @entity15 in an orange jumpsuit , holding messages			0
" we have not received any recent information about him , " said his wife , @entity15 , " although i do believe he is safe and will come home to us soon			0
