-- @entity1 has logged more than 16,000 miles in the past two years			2
she 's been to @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 she 's not a beach bum , though			0
@entity1 is a 3,456 - pound great white shark			1
you would n't want to run into her in the surf , but you can follow her on @entity8 and track her movements online			2
she 's one of five great white sharks along the @entity11 of the @entity12 that is actively " pinging " her location via satellite transmitter			1
an online map tracks the sharks ' courses as they go , so you can see nearly real - time data			1
but there 's no coast - is - clear guarantee for fearful late - summer swimmers			2
the trackers only ping when the animals surface , and sharks do n't have to surface to breathe			1
and of course there are more than five out there			0
so , if the recent shark - kayaker encounter or shark sightings in @entity35 have you worried , your best bet is to look at the stats , shark trackers say			1
" do n't go play with the seals in the water at dawn or dusk			0
other than that , enjoy life , go swimming			0
because if you 're worried about a shark interaction , you should be scared to death to get in the car , " says @entity45 , founder and expedition leader of @entity47 , the research and educational nonprofit that tagged and tracks @entity1 and other sharks			1
in 2013 , there were 72 shark attacks worldwide , according to the @entity57			2
of those , 10 were fatal			0
there were 47 attacks in the @entity12 in 2013 , with one fatality in @entity62			0
compare that with more than 33,000 fatal vehicle crashes in the @entity12 in 2012 , the last full year for which figures are available			0
in the first half of 2013 , more than 15,000 motor vehicle traffic fatalities are estimated , according to the @entity69			0
" if you 're the kind of person who 's scared of sharks and wants to know if there 's one around you , there 's no technology for that , " says @entity70 , a biologist with @entity35 ' @entity71 who has tagged sharks with @entity47			2
still , the @entity82 with wet - dry switches that are activated when the sharks surface provide a pretty interesting picture			1
on @entity47 's online tracker you can see each shark 's tangle of pings over several years , tracing their movements over thousands of miles			1
@entity70 has been researching sharks for more than 25 years and has teamed up with @entity93 and @entity47 three times in the past few years to tag great whites along the @entity11			1
he 's tracking @entity1 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99			0
@entity96 is a real world traveler			2
" @entity96 is an exciting shark			2
@entity96 makes it look like @entity1 is a real homebody , " @entity70 said			2
@entity96 was tagged in march 2013 and has already logged more than 25,000 miles			2
over the last six years , @entity103 has tagged more than 40 great white sharks using various tracking devices			1
the five tagged with @entity47 provide real - time tracking , while other trackers offer data after they detach from the shark			1
@entity93 , who is not a biologist , has led more than 20 research expeditions with scientists around the world since 2007 , tagging about 80 great white sharks in total			1
@entity47 gathers data and tags sharks and other marine predators by taking them out of the water for about 15 minutes using a custom lift			0
that ability to lift sharks weighing thousands of pounds out of the water to attach tags that track their movements in real - time is what distinguishes @entity47 , @entity70 says			1
some of the sharks also have @entity8 accounts			0
" every time a shark decides to set up its own @entity8 account , it 's not really up to us			1
we do n't decide that , " says @entity93			0
it 's a personality thing , he joked			0
@entity1 tweets occasionally , while @entity97 , who 's in her late teens , is a " chatterbox " with more than 16,000 followers			0
the real identity of the tweeters is a mystery			0
" people were inspired to give these sharks voices , and we do n't know who they are , " @entity93 said			0
@entity93 credits the publicly shared shark tracker and the power of social media with helping to change the tone of the conversation around sharks			1
after all , they 're king of the sea , and the marine ecosystem depends on them			0
one - ton shark headed to @entity162 coast what devoured this great white shark ?			1

real - time shark tracker shows movements of great white sharks
five great whites are actively pinging their locations off the @entity11
pings are activated when the sharks surface , so movements are logged erratically
