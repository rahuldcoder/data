-- in a refreshingly honest statement , @entity2 's mobile division vp @entity3 admitted that the @entity5 2 made some parts of @entity2 's 10.1 - inch @entity7 look " inadequate , " and the @entity5 2 's pricing might force @entity2 to lower the price of its tablet			1
" @entity12 made it very thin (...) we will have to improve the parts that are inadequate , " @entity3 told @entity11			0
we feel that a bit of information might have gotten lost in translation from @entity19 to @entity20 , as we definitely do n't expect @entity2 to pull the 10.1 - inch @entity7 from the market and release a thinner version			1
it 's more likely that @entity2 simply sees the @entity25 's thinness as a big challenge for its future tablet models			2
the other part of @entity3 's statement is clearer and far more telling			0
" the 10 - inch ( tablet ) was to be priced higher than the 7 - inch , but we will have to think that over , " he said			0
@entity2 , unlike some of its competitors -- for example , the @entity35 -- wo n't try to compete with the @entity5 at a higher price point just because some of the hardware of its tablet looks better on paper and that , in our opinion , is the right approach			0
@entity12 has set the price for its tablet in the $ 499 -- $ 829 price range ( with the cheapest 3g - sporting option being priced at $ 629 ) , and any @entity51 tablet will have a hard time competing with the ipad 2 at a price too near the upper end of that spectrum			1

@entity2 's mobile vp made *remarkably* *candid* *remarks* about company 's 10.1 - inch @entity7
the @entity25 's pricing might force @entity2 to lower the price of its tablet
@entity12 has set the price for its tablet in the $ 499 - $ 829 range
