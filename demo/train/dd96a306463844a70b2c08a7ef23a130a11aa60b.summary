its inventor , @entity12 , built it during downtime from his full - time gig creating props and modestly describes it as a " tiny watch made of garbage			1
" still , @entity12 's laser watch has attracted its share of attention for being an entertaining , if mildly dangerous , bit of technology			1
( it will burn skin if the wearer is n't careful			0
