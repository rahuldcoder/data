-- it was the scene for one of the most famous controversies in soccer history			0
did @entity7 striker @entity6 's shot during the 1966 @entity9 final at @entity10 cross the line ? the @entity12 who was running the line that day thought so and his decision helped @entity7 to a 4 - 2 win over @entity17 -- their only major tournament success to date			1
forty - six years later , the same @entity20 stadium will provide the setting for a major test of pioneering goal - line technology ( @entity24 ) , that could revolutionize the game of football forever			1
@entity28 firm " @entity39 " employ a series of cameras mounted inside the goal frame and their approach will be tested during @entity7 's @entity34 warm - up match with @entity35 , though none of the information will be available to the match officials			1
goal - line technology enters final testing scientists and @entity44 officials will analyze the results and if they prove successful , the technology could be ratified at a meeting of the @entity48 ( @entity48 ) in early july			1
the experiment in front of an estimated crowd of 90,000 at @entity10 follows the first @entity39 trial at a non-league @entity54 cup match earlier this month			1
an alternative system , designed by @entity57 company " @entity56 " is also in the final stages of testing			0
it is somewhat ironic the technology is to be examined during an @entity7 match as the team were on the wrong end of a refereeing decision at the @entity66			2
@entity68 's shot was disallowed during a second round match with @entity17 despite replays showing the ball was a full yard over the goal - line			1
that incident in @entity74 prompted @entity44 to overturn their long - held stance on goal - line technology and begin trials			1
a statement on @entity44 's website said : " only the @entity81 observers , @entity48 and @entity44 representatives at @entity10 will have access to the @entity24 system readings			2
" therefore , should a goal - line incident occur at this or any of the ' test ' matches , the system will not be utilized by the match officials			1
it means the @entity24 system will have no influence on the outcome of the matches in which the system is being tested			0
" such tests , along with those being conducted for the @entity56 system in @entity98 , could lead to the @entity48 approving the introduction of @entity24 at its special meeting at the beginning of july			0
" there have been several contentious incidents in the last @entity54 season that has renewed calls for the technology to be introduced			0
@entity108 were awarded a goal in an @entity111 semifinal against @entity112 at @entity10 that was shown not to have crossed the line , while @entity116 defender @entity115 's header against @entity117 was n't given despite being well over the line			2
@entity120 chairman @entity119 has said he is keen to introduce the technology next season if it is rubber - stamped by @entity44			1
@entity44 have also confirmed that referees are to be drug tested to check they are not taking performance enhancing substances			0
at a meeting of the world governing body 's executive committee , chief medical officer @entity127 said match officials should be subject to the same tests as players			2
" we have to consider referees as part of the game , " he was quoted as saying by the @entity28 @entity134			0
" we have started to discuss this and this is something for the future which will be discussed to include possibly an anti-doping program for referees			0
" we do not have an indication that this is a problem but this is something we have to look at			0
the referees are a neglected population			0

@entity44 to trial goal - line technology during @entity7 's *friendly* with @entity35 at @entity10
@entity39 technology wo n't be available for match officials during the @entity34 warm up
if the tests prove successful goal - line technology could be ratified in early july
@entity120 chairman has *suggested* it could be introduced *mid-season*
