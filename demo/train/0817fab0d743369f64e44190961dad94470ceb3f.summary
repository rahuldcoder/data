there are many reasons why the @entity3 is perhaps the least - loved agency in @entity4 -- a tax code so complex that it seems like you need an advanced degree to understand it , the dreaded audit process and revelations that certain groups have been targeted based on their political beliefs			1
and now , a growing awareness of instances where the @entity3 seized the money or property of law - abiding citizens without due process is adding to the agency 's menacing reputation			1
according to the @entity23 , a public interest law firm that investigates civil forfeiture practices , these seizures carried out by the @entity3 had increased from 114 in 2005 to 639 in 2012			1
sounds unbelievable , but believe it			0
under a federal structuring statute , banks are required to report all cash deposits of more than $ 10,000 to the @entity29 of the @entity30			0
to prevent money laundering , deposits purposely " structured " to evade this reporting are illegal			2
in @entity34 , the @entity3 suspected a local grocer , @entity36 , of money laundering			1
without filing charges , it seized his $ 35,000 bank account			0
@entity36 had to prove in court that his daily bank deposits were for insurance reasons and to reduce robbery at his store -- not a criminal enterprise			2
fortunately , the @entity46 won their case , and the @entity3 returned their funds			2
@entity50 native @entity49 has made an honest living owning and operating a restaurant , mrs. lady 's , for 38 years			0
but in august 2013 , everything she saved -- roughly $ 33,000 -- was seized			0
the @entity3 targeted hinders because her restaurant only accepted cash or checks , which made regular bank deposits necessary			2
after 19 months and extensive national media exposure , hinders finally got her money back			0
in @entity63 , the @entity3 used suspicions of structuring to seize the operating accounts of locally owned @entity66 and forced owners @entity68 and @entity69 to prove their innocence			1
fortunately , the @entity71 settled their case by showing their deposits were legitimate but only after expending extensive time and energy			0
recent announcements by the @entity77 and @entity30 departments that they will end most forms of equitable sharing -- the practice of federal law enforcement coordinating with local and state law enforcement for the purpose of pursuing civil asset forfeiture cases -- are a start , but this only affects a fraction of overall seizures			1
in addition to the @entity3 , the @entity89 and @entity4 attorney 's offices across the country have civil asset forfeiture authority			1
in fact , the @entity4 attorney 's office for the @entity97 , run by attorney general nominee @entity98 , has been an active seizure office			0
a disturbing example under her watch is the @entity104 case , where her prosecutors confiscated $ 446,651 from a small business run by @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109			0
it took @entity98 two years finally to drop the charges			0
in light of this case and her office 's extensive practice of civil forfeiture -- more than 120 times during her tenure -- it was disappointing to hear her defend the current system during wednesday 's confirmation hearing before the @entity124			2
beyond these specific examples of abuse , @entity125 must take a hard look at the underlying federal civil asset forfeiture policies			1
ultimately , the @entity130 must be eliminated through legislative action as part of a larger package of reforms to the entire practice of civil asset forfeiture			1
for this reason , we have combined our previous efforts to introduce the @entity140 , or @entity141 , in both the @entity142 and @entity124			0
it would bolster protections for property and property owners by raising the level of proof necessary for the federal government to prove a civil asset forfeiture case -- requiring that the @entity3 and @entity89 prove guilt , rather than the individual prove innocence			1
moreover , the @entity141 eliminates incentives for civil forfeiture by rerouting funds seized by the @entity3 to the general treasury rather than the unaccountable @entity158 , which has little congressional oversight and has grown since its inception in 1986 to more than $ 2 billion in 2013			1
this fund is the depository for all forfeiture dollars seized by the @entity3 , @entity89 and equitable sharing partners -- such as local police forces -- at the state and local level			1
lastly , the @entity141 inserts protections by mandating the @entity3 prove individuals have knowingly violated the structuring statute instead of simply inferring guilt from the deposits themselves			1
making cash deposits does not automatically put you under suspicion of criminal activity			0
the @entity141 will ensure that federal government agencies , like the @entity3 and @entity89 , no longer profit from taking the property of @entity4 citizens without due process , while maintaining the ability of courts to order the surrender of proceeds of crime			2
the @entity141 intends to tilt the playing field back in favor of due process and property rights			0
we call on our colleagues in @entity125 to address this issue and join our efforts .			0

@entity196 , @entity197 : @entity3 ' civil asset forfeiture policies can *ensnare* the innocent
these *people* must sue to *recover* their money , @entity196 and @entity197 say
authors have introduced legislation to compel government to prove guilt before asset seizures
