in " @entity36 , " he had a recurring role as father @entity38 , the sturdy founder of @entity39 , the show 's hospital , who offered guidance to a future doctor			2
the latter role earned him two emmy nominations			2
and then there was @entity5 , the blue - blooded father of @entity24 , whose snappy dialogue -- often with his daughter or his wife ( @entity50 ) -- could n't hide his big heart , especially when it came to his granddaughter @entity54 , played by @entity55			1
that relationship was reflected in real life , he told the @entity58 in 2012			2
" i was sort of delegated from time to time to look after her , and i was very , very fond of her , " he said , noting that @entity55 had a number of challenges her first years on the show			0
" one summer , i thought , ' she 's not going to make it			0

' but then she went to @entity65 with a friend to learn cooking , and i thought , " she 's going to be fine			0
' " @entity9 had his star turns as well			1

" ) he won a @entity78 for his performance in a 1976 revival of @entity83 's " mrs. @entity82 's profession			0
" his performance in " @entity8 " led to his only @entity86 win			0
even people who did n't recognize him probably knew his mellifluous voice from audiobooks and @entity92 documentaries			0
but , in general , he was content to be a supporting performer , one of the esteemed and distinctive cadre of performers thought of as " character actors			2
" he went easily from role to role -- his internet movie database page includes 130 credits , including small spots in " @entity103 , " " @entity104 " and " @entity105 " -- and he reveled in the work			0
in the @entity58 interview , he expresses enthusiasm for almost everything he appeared in			0

" " sometimes i 'm stuck in a straitjacket with suits , playing @entity120 and @entity7 and so on , and i said , ' these guys are really wonky , and they 're where the kids are these days , so do it ! what 's the matter with you ? ' " he said			1
