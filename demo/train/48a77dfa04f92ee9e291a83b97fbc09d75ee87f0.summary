-- homeland security officials on wednesday abruptly shelved a proposal to build a national database of license - plate scans after criticism from privacy advocates			1
the proposal , which had been posted online last week by the office of @entity9 , sought a contractor who could establish a searchable database of license plates , with the times and locations where they were spotted by traffic cameras and other sources			1
but in a statement late wednesday , the department announced a reversal			0
" the solicitation , which was posted without the awareness of @entity9 leadership , has been canceled , " said spokeswoman @entity21			0
" while we continue to support a range of technologies to help meet our law enforcement mission , this solicitation will be reviewed to ensure the path forward appropriately meets our operational needs			2
" it was unclear whether the proposal was dead or was merely withdrawn for revisions			0
under the proposal , officers in the field would have been able to use their smartphones to look up a license plate and see every time and every place the vehicle had been spotted by a camera			2
" the database should track vehicle license plate numbers that pass through cameras or are voluntarily entered into the system from a variety of sources ( access control systems , asset recovery specialists , etc. ) and uploaded to share with law enforcement , " the original solicitation read			1
the proposed @entity54 database was to have been used by immigration officers to find and arrest fugitives			0
supporters of license - plate scanning , like former @entity60 state homeland security chief @entity59 , said it could have been an invaluable tool for finding dangerous suspects			1
" what license - plate readers have been used for most effectively is ( trying ) to do hits against outstanding warrants , against unlicensed drivers , against folks who have shown before that they 've been involved in some kind of crime -- that 's where the hits come			1
" but since the solicitation was posted and featured in the @entity75 , privacy advocates have warned that the database sounded like a dragnet that would track the whereabouts of all drivers , including people who have done nothing wrong , and that the records might be held indefinitely			2
" the idea is , we want to collect everything on perfectly innocent people and then dip into it whenever we feel like it , " said @entity83 of the @entity84			1
" there have already been quite a few cases of abuse			0
essentially , the problem is that this is creating a nationwide warrantless location - tracking list			0
" opponents also said the tracking of cars would reveal personal information about drivers , like whether they went to church , where they slept at night , or whether they had been to an abortion clinic or a political protest .			0

@entity9 sought bids for a license - plate tracking database
database would have been able to see where a vehicle 's plate had been captured on camera
tool would have helped law enforcement find *criminals* , one proponent says
database would have *violated* the privacy of innocent people , @entity84 *argues*
