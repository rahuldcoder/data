-- dealing with deep drug war wounds is a top issue on @entity4 's presidential campaign trail , but the election results could have an impact on both sides of the @entity4 - @entity9 border			1
as candidates across party lines suggest new strategies , like reducing violence and taking troops off the streets , some @entity9 lawmakers say they 're nervous that cross-border cooperation could wane after @entity4 voters pick a new president july 1			1
last week , a @entity21 congressman told the head of the @entity23 that he was concerned about @entity4 's " impending change in power			2
" and sen. @entity26 , @entity27 , said in february that he feared at least one @entity4 presidential candidate was not committed to continuing his country 's campaign against organized crime			1
worries in @entity33 as @entity4 's election looms are a reminder of the close ties binding the neighboring nations			2
the two countries share billions of dollars in trade and a border that stretches for nearly 2,000 miles			0
millions of @entity9 citizens travel to @entity4 every year , and millions of @entity4 immigrants -- legal and illegal -- live in the @entity9			1
" almost no other country affects the @entity9 as much on a day to day basis as @entity4 , " said @entity43 , a latin american studies fellow at the @entity45			1
" what happens in @entity4 is hugely important for the @entity9			1
" for nearly six years , a brutal drug war in @entity4 with a staggering death toll of more than 47,500 people has dominated discussions between the two countries			1
photos : violence in @entity55 announcing a crackdown on cartels and sending troops into the streets to help fight the battle were among the first major moves by president @entity62 after he took office in december 2006			0
the @entity9 voiced its support and offered $ 1.6 billion to aid in the fight			0
@entity9 officials have praised growing cooperation with the @entity4 government as a key weapon in the war on drugs			1
but on the campaign trail in @entity4 this year , the three leading candidates have stressed the need to shift strategies			1
is @entity4 's drug war strategy working ? leftist candidate @entity77 of the opposition @entity78 has summed up his security policy as " abrazos , no balazos " ( hugs , not bullets )			1
he started his campaign with a pledge to pull back troops from @entity4 's streets , but he said last month that the military would remain deployed until there is a " trained , skilled and moralized " police force			2
@entity91 of the ruling @entity92 has apparently tried to distance herself from @entity62 's policies with a simple slogan : " @entity96 " ( different @entity95 )			0
" the results will be measured not just by criminals captured , but by how stable and secure communities are , " her campaign website says			0
the @entity4 drug war : bodies for billions @entity103 of the opposition @entity104 ( @entity104 ) has pledged to focus more on reducing violence and less on catching cartel leaders and blocking drugs from reaching the @entity9			1
he told @entity108 that federal , state and local authorities would coordinate a better security plan on his watch			0
" i propose adjusting the strategy and making a national front that involves the three levels of the government , focused on diminishing the violence in the country , " he said			0
some political opponents of @entity103 , whose party governed @entity4 for more than 70 years until 2000 , have warned that negotiating with drug cartels and gangs could be on his agenda -- an accusation that @entity103 has repeatedly denied			2
@entity125 : @entity4 on the rise but his denials have n't squelched speculation on both sides of the border that negotiating with cartels -- or at least easing the pressure on them -- could be on the table			0
in a congressional hearing last week , @entity9 rep. @entity136 said the war on drugs was nearing a " potential crossroad , " referring to @entity103 's plan and his party 's political history			1
" while in power , the @entity104 minimized violence by turning a blind eye to the cartels , " the @entity144 @entity21 said , noting that @entity103 " does not emphasize stopping drug shipments or capturing kingpins			0
" minutes earlier , @entity23 administrator @entity151 had testified that @entity4 had extradited more than 200 accused suspects to the @entity9 since 2010			2
" without reservation , i would characterize the cooperation between @entity9 and @entity4 at an all - time high , " she said			1
@entity136 said the close teamwork could be short - lived			0
" i worry that the relationship could be at a high water mark with the impending change in power , " he said			0
in a statement the next day , @entity103 's campaign said he was committed to combatting organized crime			0
" the law is applied , it is never negotiated , " the statement said			0
no matter who wins , the election will likely mark " a change from where @entity9 - @entity4 security strategy has been , " said @entity43 of the @entity45			2
but the shift is something @entity9 officials who work with @entity4 have prepared for , she said			2
@entity173 , director of the center for @entity175 at @entity176 in @entity33 , said a change in presidential leadership will give @entity4 officials a chance to consider fresh approaches to deal with drug - related violence and other issues that affect the @entity9 , such as economic and energy policies			1
" between the three candidates and the predecessors , there would be an opportunity to reflect on what worked , and what did n't work , and how , perhaps things should be changed , " he said			0
the concerns from some @entity9 lawmakers about a shift in drug war strategy are overblown , he said			1
" all three of the major candidates have committed themselves to fighting drug trafficking and reducing the violence , " @entity173 said			0
" all three are very much committed to working with the @entity9			2
" that itself is a notable shift from past elections , when cross-border relations soured or sweetened based on who won the presidential vote , according to @entity208 , director of the @entity209 at the @entity210			0
" the @entity9 - @entity4 relationship has now matured to a point where changes in party and personality matter less than they used to , " he said			2
" this is a country that matters enormously for the @entity9 , and for the first time , perhaps , what happens in the elections wo n't change [ that relationship ] much			0
" @entity4 's candidates vow a different kind of drug war @entity223 contributed to this report .			1
