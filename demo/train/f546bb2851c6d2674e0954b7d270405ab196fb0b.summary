that aimed to investigate the effects of global warming in polar regions			0

the tags fell off when the animals molted			0
the fourth @entity6 , which began in march 2007 and actually covered two full years , ended last month , after 160 scientific projects were undertaken by researchers from over 60 countries			1
a joint project by the @entity18 ( @entity19 ) and @entity20			0
( @entity20 ) , the @entity6 hoped to spearhead efforts to better monitor and understand the @entity24 and @entity25 regions			1
the project had international funding of about us $ 1.2 billion over the two - year period			0
" @entity32 2007/2008 came at a crossroads for the planet 's future , " said @entity29 , @entity30 of @entity20 in a press statement			0
" the new evidence resulting from polar research will strengthen the scientific basis on which we build future actions			2
" researchers found that in the @entity24 during the summers of 2007 and 2008 , the minimum extent of year - round sea ice decreased to its lowest level since satellite records began 30 years ago			2
according to a report published by the @entity6 organizing committee in february , their research indicates that global warming is affecting @entity25 in ways not previously identified			1
other evidence of climate change came from @entity6 research vessels that found warming waters in the @entity56 and an increase in melting ice that is creating fresher bottom water around the coast of @entity25			1
among efforts to study the effects of climate change on @entity25 , was @entity65 project to study marine mammals			1
custom - designed tags were attached to elephant seals to study the animals ' habits , although researcher realized the tags could also help with field research on climate change			1
the electronic tags -- which fell off when the seals molted -- sent back data on temperature and salinity the oceans around @entity25 , particularly around the @entity81 in east @entity25			1
while ice - shelf melt has been recorded in the west of @entity25 , scientists are concerned that it could happen in the east as well			2
another project to study the underside of an @entity25 glacier deployed an autonomous robot submarine			1
the team from the @entity91 and @entity92 sent the " @entity98 " on six missions to study the @entity94 and how changes in ocean temperature were affecting the @entity97			0
using sonar , the submarine picked its way around the glacier and sent back data that created three - dimensional maps that scientists used to determine where and how the warmth of the ocean waters was melting the glacier 's base			0
" if [ the @entity97 ] were to melt completely , global sea levels would rise by as much as 5 meters , " said @entity111 , the @entity91 lead scientist on the project			0
" because so little is known about ice - sheet behavior , this research will take us a step further in understanding how ice sheets will contribute to sea - level rise			0

the projects ' aim is to study effects of climate change on @entity25
the @entity6 ended last month after two years of research
the @entity6 *featured* 160 scientific projects by researchers from over 60 countries
