-- the co-star of " 27 dresses " discusses his personal style			1
" i just feel dirty , " says @entity4			1
not to be alarmed : there 's nothing indecent going on here			1
@entity4 talks about his favorite kind of clothes and how his style has changed over the years			1
the 34 - year - old is explaining what it feels like to be sporting facial hair for a film he 's working on with @entity15			1
yet even the newly grown whiskers ca n't hide the finely chiseled features of an actor who seems to have cornered the @entity20 market on hottie - who - loses - the - girl roles ( " enchanted , " " @entity24 " and , of course , " @entity26			1
" ) but the @entity28 - bred star does n't mind his wholesome image			2
" that 's really me , " he says			1
" i 'm a little dorky -- awkward			2
" however , his onscreen luck could be changing with his latest film , " @entity33 , " a romantic comedy co-starring @entity35			2
scruffy or not , we 'll be watching			2
you 've played a prince in " @entity39 " and the superhero cyclops in the " x-men " movies			2
is that a big deal to your kids and their friends ? my daughter , @entity46 , is only 2 , and my son , @entity48 , is 7			0
he has a @entity50 action figure , but he 's really into @entity52 and @entity53 movies -- @entity54 is his guy			1
no " @entity55 , " no " x-men			0
" i think he just assumes that everyone at his school has a dad who 's a big superhero			1
you also played @entity61 , the tv dance - show host in " @entity62			0
" what were you like in high school ? that 's when i came out of my shell and became more social -- people thought i was funny			1
i got into a whole preppy thing -- @entity70 shorts and @entity71			1
how would you describe your style now ? functional comfort			1
for a guy , it should n't ever look like you thought about it too much , like the clothes are wearing you			0
whose clothes do you like ? @entity80 off the rack -- it 's a slim cut , and i do n't need to have it tailored			1
i always feel like an 8 - year - old when i dress up in a suit , like , when can i take this thing off ? but i wore a black @entity89 suit to the première of " @entity62 " that was like , ok , now i know what a great suit is			1
classic , clean lines -- sharp , sharp , sharp			0
do you change your style from coast to coast ? in @entity97 it 's too easy to throw on a pair of @entity100 sweats , a t - shirt and running shoes and just wear those for days			1
in @entity104 , i actually like looking nice			0
maybe i 'm just getting older , but young guys need to pull their pants up			0
do you ever shop for your wife ? i love shopping for dresses , and i actually do a pretty good job			1
when i was in @entity104 , i went into @entity110 in @entity111 and got her a cool fifties type dress with tiny polka dots			1
style-wise i 'm good , but figuring out sizing is a different story			0
what do you find sexy on a woman ? i like spaghetti straps for my wife -- she has great shoulders and a great neck			0
i love when she puts her hair up , because i can see the back of her neck , so delicate and vulnerable			0
it 's the vampire in me			1
or my obsession with cheerleaders -- their hair up in a ponytail			0
when i was young , i could never have that			0
never got the cheerleader ? eventually -- my wife was a cheerleader			0
what does your wife find sexy on you ? a button - front shirt with [ baby ] spit - up on the shoulder			0
that means a guy is taking care of the kids and is a good father -- that 's sexy to a woman			2
the adult version of rose petals and champagne is if i let my wife sleep in and i get up to change the baby 's diaper , feed the kids , and do the dishes			2
who inspires you ? @entity158			1
my middle name is @entity80 , and my grandfather once said i was going to look like @entity158			1
beyond being a good - looking guy , @entity158 is a great actor with a long career , and he 's got a life			1
he 's married with kids and lives in @entity167 , sells popcorn and marinara sauce , and gives the money to charity			2
anyone else ? @entity174 dresses like @entity175 might have			0
" @entity178 " - era @entity177			0
they all made it look effortless			0
their clothes framed their personalities really well -- comfortable , classic , but sharp			0
these guys could pull off a great suit , or jeans and a t - shirt			0
do n't you agree that guys have it easy -- they are considered " distinguished " as they grow older ? i do n't think it 's guy - specific			1
as women get older , they become more comfortable with themselves			2
@entity196 is the poster woman for that			0
a lot of guys fantasize about being with women who are in their forties or fifties			2
so your advice is ... ? act your age			0
that does n't mean you ca n't have fun			0
and is n't it time you got the girl in one of your movies ? there are a couple of things i need to do [ onscreen ] : one , get the girl ; two , pack a gun			0
do n't you love my career philosophy ? e-mail to a friend get a free trial issue of @entity223 ! copyright © 2008 @entity225 all rights reserved .			2
