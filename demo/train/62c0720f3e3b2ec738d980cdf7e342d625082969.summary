@entity0 -- pilots at @entity3 have nice big planes , but nowhere to go			1
pilots are shown picketing against @entity3 in a @entity7 video			1
none of the cargo carrier 's eight @entity9 have lavatories , pilots say , forcing the pilots and crews to use plastic bags for all their elimination needs			1
" this is what you use for a @entity23 , " one pilot says in a @entity7 video , grabbing a small green bag			1
" and a much bigger bag for a number two			2
" the video has become the most compelling argument in the pilot 's public - relations arsenal ever since flight crews went on strike august 27			1
pay issues may be their top concern , but the lack of bathrooms has had the greatest resonance with the public , striking workers acknowledge			1
" nobody can believe that there 's no bathroom on a plane of this size , " said @entity38 , a striking pilot who has flown for @entity3 for 9 1/2 years			1
so at picket lines , and on @entity7 , pilots have been hoisting the plastic bags , which the airline provides in lieu of a loo			1
" it 's degrading , " said @entity50 , one of two women pilots employed by the carrier			0
the striking pilots say @entity3 originally removed the plane 's lavatories to reduce the plane 's weight and the cost of servicing the restrooms			1
" initially , they did n't provide anything , " said pilot and shop steward @entity61			1
" the bags that you see ... they did n't even provide those			2
eventually they realized there were some corrosion issues when crew members had to go into the cargo hold to use the bathroom			2
so that 's when they started to provide pee bags and bags to go @entity25			0
" pilots say that the bags are fitted around a metal frame somewhat like portable johns used by campers			0
at the end of their flights , pilots dispose of the bags in an airport dumpster			0
pilots also complain that there are privacy issues , since cargo handlers sometimes ride in the cargo hold , where pilots go to the bathroom			2
" you just have to be real discreet , " @entity61 said			0
" you have to do it in front of everybody else			0
" an @entity3 official declined to comment on the lavatory issue , or even discuss whether the planes have lavatories			1
a @entity104 spokeswoman said lavatories , or the lack thereof , are not a concern for regulators			1
" that 's not an aviation safety issue			2
it 's a passenger or crew - member comfort issue , " said agency spokeswoman @entity111			2
" there is absolutely no requirement for any aircraft to have a lavatory			0
" that includes large passenger planes used for cross-country flights , @entity111 said			0
nor does the @entity121 require lavatories on planes , saying aircraft do not fall under their jurisdiction			1
but one business industry group says lavatories should be a concern			0
@entity129 of the @entity130 , which represents corporate travel offices , called @entity3 's working conditions " worse than the sweatshops of the 1930s " and said it is a safety issue			1
" you can not have these kind of conditions and have them compatible with safety margins			0
it just does n't work that way			0
you need motivated employees with good morale that are well - rested coming up to work to fly these aircraft , " @entity129 said			0
" poor morale among flight attendants leads to poor service			0
poor morale among pilots can lead to something far more dangerous , " he said			0
" these cargo aircraft are flying in the same space as commercial passenger aircraft			0
these pilots are making split - second decisions on landings , on diversions , on crossing runways			0
and you want these people to be well - trained , well - rested and with high morale -- and that does n't appear to be the set of circumstances at @entity3 , " @entity129 said			1
pilots in the industry say the major cargo carriers all fly planes with lavatories , but several smaller cargo carriers have eliminated restrooms .			2

@entity3 flight crews went on strike august 27 , *chiefly* over pay issues
lack of bathrooms on planes has caused more of stir with public , strikers says
on @entity7 video , striking pilot shows bag in which crew must urinate
@entity104 says it does n't regulate lavatories , and @entity121 says issue is n't its jurisdiction
