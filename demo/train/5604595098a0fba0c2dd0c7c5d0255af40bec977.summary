-- @entity1 is one of @entity3 's most prominent young ballet dancers , an international performer and award winner both at home and overseas			1
but for @entity1 to be accepted into the rarefied world of classical dance -- which in @entity3 is traditionally seen as an elitist and a predominantly white preserve -- the boy from the rough @entity9 townships says he had to overcome outdated stereotypes			1
" i used to be picked upon for the way i walk and the way i act or carry myself , " he says of his time at school , where he became disparagingly known as " the dude who did ballet			0
" he even recalls his closest friends teasing him about the tights , shoes , underwear and sparkly clothes that he would have to wear during practice and on stage			0
but by remaining focused , diligent and passionate about dance , the young @entity1 never let the jibes get him down and he continued to practice obsessively			2
in late 2008 , this perseverance was rewarded as he was offered a place at the @entity30 , one of the most prestigious dance companies in the @entity33			0
that year he shot to fame in a production of @entity36 by the @entity37			0
now 23 , @entity1 has gone on to win awards at the @entity40 and @entity41 international ballet competitions , as well as securing prominent roles in numerous ballet productions across the world			2
this success , he hopes , will eventually enable him to change conventionally held views not only of black dancers but male ballet dancers in general			2
" what i wanted was to change people 's minds in @entity3 about black ballet dancers			1
i wanted to change that view , because everybody used to put it in a category for the elite people or , you know , it 's only for a certain racial group , " he says			0
" i [ want to ] set the bar for anybody else that 's coming , that 's growing up , that 's coming behind , and they will learn from my actions and what i do and hopefully i become a role model for them , especially @entity3 , " he adds .			1
