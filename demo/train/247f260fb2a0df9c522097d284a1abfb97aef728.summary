-- after @entity3 president @entity2 and @entity5 chancellor @entity4 discussed hot - button issues like @entity3 's surveillance programs during his visit to @entity9 on wednesday , the leaders addressed them with reporters			1
@entity2 visited @entity5 , the @entity3 ' largest @entity11 trading partner , after attending a @entity13 conference earlier this week in @entity14			1
below is a quick look at what @entity2 said wednesday -- a few hours before he spoke to the public at @entity9 's @entity19 -- on @entity11 concerns about @entity3 surveillance programs , @entity23 's disagreement with the @entity3 over @entity24 , and more : 1 ) @entity5 still leery about @entity3 surveillance @entity4 and @entity2 discussed @entity5 's concerns about the @entity3 prism program , which monitors e-mails , photos , search histories and other data from @entity3 - based @entity33 companies			1
@entity4 told reporters that she appreciates @entity3 cooperation with @entity5 on cybersecurity , but will continue to discuss with @entity3 officials the " question of balance or proportionality " of government snooping on the @entity33			1
@entity2 stressed that " this is not a situation in which we are rifling through the ordinary e-mails of @entity5 citizens or @entity3 citizens , " but that it 's a " circumscribed , narrow system , directed at us being able to protect our people , and all of it is done under the oversight of the courts			1
" the programs have stopped threats , he said -- including some in @entity5			0
@entity2 said when he gets back home , he 'll try to declassify more information about the programs and have officials " work very closely with our @entity5 intelligence counterparts so that they have clarity and assurance that they are not being abused			1
" 2 ) @entity2 not shaken by halt in @entity67 talks a reporter asked @entity2 how the @entity3 and @entity67 president @entity69 could seemingly be on different pages , after @entity69 on wednesday shelved security talks with the @entity3 amid friction over planned @entity3 peace talks with the @entity74 in @entity75			1
@entity2 did n't seem rattled			2
" we had anticipated that at the outset there were going to be some areas of friction , to put it mildly , in getting this thing of the ground , " he said			0
the @entity74 and other @entity67 have " been fighting for a very long time			0
" " i think president @entity69 himself recognizes the need for political reconciliation			0
the challenge is , how do you get those things started while you 're also at war ? my hope is ... that despite those challenges , the process will proceed			2
" 3 ) on @entity23 's support for @entity24 's president @entity2 was asked how peace could ever come to @entity24 when the @entity3 and its allies support the opposition while @entity23 supports the regime of @entity24 president @entity102			1
@entity2 did n't dispute the premise that @entity23 and @entity3 are backing opposite sides , but chose to highlight what they publicly hold in common : a desire for peace talks in @entity109			1
@entity2 said @entity23 president @entity112 " believes what would replace @entity102 is worse than @entity102 himself			2
" " ( but ) what i think will become more and more apparent in the coming weeks and months is that without a different government , you ca n't bring peace , and in fact you 're going to see sectarian divisions get worse and worse , " @entity2 said			0
4 ) we still love you , @entity11 @entity2 talked up negotiations for a new trans - atlantic trade pact between the @entity3 and the @entity122			2
and he took the opportunity to allay concerns that the @entity3 might be taking @entity11 for granted while it courts countries in @entity126			0
" i know that here in @entity5 , sometimes there has been talk that the trans - @entity131 alliance is fading in importance , that the @entity3 has turned its attention more towards @entity126 and the @entity135 , " @entity2 said			2
" in both conversations with chancellor @entity4 and earlier with your president , i reminded them that from our perspective , the relationship with @entity11 remains the cornerstone of our freedom and our security -- that @entity11 is our partner in almost everything that we do			0
" if the free - trade negotiations succeed , he said , " we can grow economies on both sides of the @entity131 , create jobs , improve efficiency , ( and ) improve productivity and our competitiveness around the world			0
" 5 ) no counterterorrism drones launched from @entity5 , @entity2 says @entity2 , asked about @entity3 's use of unmanned drones to target terror suspects , reiterated what he 's said in recent weeks : that the @entity3 is thinking carefully about how it uses the technology			2
interestingly , he made it a point to say that the @entity3 does n't launch drones from @entity5 for counterterrorism efforts			0
" i can say though that we do not use @entity5 as a launching point for unmanned drones ... as part of our counterterrorism activities			0
there have been some reports here in @entity5 that that might be the case , but that is not , " he said			0
in @entity9 , @entity2 calls for reducing @entity3 , @entity23 nuclear stockpiles			1

@entity2 , after talking to @entity4 about @entity3 surveillance , says he 'll try to declassify more info
on @entity67 *canceling* talks with @entity3 , @entity2 says friction not *surprising*
he *expresses* hope that " despite those challenges the process will proceed "
