@entity0 -- the @entity2 filed a federal class action lawsuit wednesday against the city of @entity0 and several members of the @entity6 , including police commissioner @entity7 , challenging the department 's " @entity10 " program , the @entity2 announced			1
" @entity10 has placed hundreds of thousands of @entity0 , mostly black and @entity13 , under siege in their own homes , " said @entity2 executive director @entity11 in a press release wednesday			1
" this aggressive assault on people 's constitutional rights must be stopped			0
" the city - sponsored program offers police patrols in residential buildings in an attempt to prevent the use and sale of drugs , according to the official @entity0 website			1
" landlords can request that the police conduct patrols in the hallways and stairwells of their building to remove nonresidents who are loitering , " the site states			0
" by challenging uninvited individuals , police are providing a level of safety to tenants that residents of doormen buildings take for granted , " deputy police commissioner @entity37 said in a press release responding to the lawsuit			1
critics dispute the role of the program			0
the program , which has existed since 1991 , is part of a citywide police policy of " suspicionless " stops and arrests that disproportionally affect communities of color , according to the @entity2			1
the lawsuit says the @entity6 program violates the @entity61 and @entity62 , @entity0 common law and the federal @entity64 , according to the court complaint provided by the @entity2			1
" the @entity6 uses @entity10 as a license to stop anybody , at any time , on suspicion of trespassing , " @entity67 staff attorney @entity66 , lead attorney on the case , said in the press release			1
" as a result , people who live in @entity10 buildings are under constant threat of being stopped , frisked , harassed and even arrested by police officers			1
this type of activity has no place in a free society , and we 're confident the courts will put a stop to it			0
" " there 's a lot that we do n't know about the program			0
it 's really shrouded in secrecy and that 's one of the problems about it , " said @entity90 , @entity2 director of communications			2
enrollment in @entity96 , is widespread , with almost all private apartments in some areas of the @entity99 and nearly 4,000 private buildings in @entity101 enrolled , the court complaint states			0
" landlords invite the police in to at least stop and talk to people who are uninvited into the building , " @entity7 told @entity1 affiliate @entity103 on wednesday			0
" this is the level of safety that people have who live in buildings with doormen			2
i would suspect that probably the attorneys involved in this case live in buildings with doormen			0
" " i believe the @entity6 has a role to play in our community			2
but right now , they do n't make us feel safe , " @entity123 , one of the suit 's plaintiffs , told the @entity2			2
" we feel under attack in our homes			0
" the @entity2 is joined by the @entity130 and @entity131 in representing the lawsuit 's 13 plaintiffs			1
the lawsuit seeks a declaration of unlawful practices and injunction against the defendants , and in addition to several changes in policy , it aims to award damages as compensation to the named plaintiffs .			0
