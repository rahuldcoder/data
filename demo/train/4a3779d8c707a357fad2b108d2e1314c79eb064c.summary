-- the one - eyed jihadist commander known as " mr. @entity2 " is back in action			1
@entity5 , whose group was responsible for the deadly attack on the @entity9 oil facility in southern @entity10 last january , appears in a new video released by his group -- the @entity12 , which translates as the " signatories in @entity14			1
" more than 30 foreign workers at the @entity17 facility in @entity10 were killed during a three - day occupation of the plant			1
@entity20 is an @entity10 but was more recently based in northern @entity21 , where he had combined kidnapping and smuggling ( hence the nickname ) with audacious terror attacks			1
he got his nickname for smuggling cigarettes across borders			0
thought to be about 40 , @entity20 was rumored to have been killed or wounded in march during the @entity31 military intervention in @entity21			0
but in the new 51 - minute video he is shown training fighters and paying tribute to another jihadist commander who was killed earlier this year			1
@entity5 shows no sign of having been wounded			1
the video shows a group of jihadists preparing for two deadly raids in neighboring @entity41 in may , which targeted a @entity31 - owned uranium mine and a @entity41 military academy			1
" my brothers , all you should do is strive and make efforts with all determination and power to bring down their sites and harm their troops , " @entity5 says before embracing the group			1
at one point , he appears to be instructing recruits in using a rocket - propelled grenade			2
the government of @entity41 sent troops to join the @entity31 - led operation in @entity21			0
commanders from the @entity12 , which is linked to @entity59 ( @entity59 ) , also appeal in the video to @entity61 in @entity62 and @entity63 to carry out attacks			2
one of them , @entity66 , a top @entity67 deputy , is filmed standing in front of a pickup truck in the desert flanked by half a dozen masked armed fighters , and issuing a direct threat in heavily accented @entity31			2
" this message is sent to @entity31 especially , to the @entity63 and to all @entity75 countries			0
like we have said since the beginning , the jihadists are ready to go on the offensive at any moment			0
we need to transmit this message to the whole world			0
we need to complete our mission at any price			0
we have told you that we will hit you in the middle of the @entity87 in @entity31 , and we will target you like we have done before -- all the @entity31 interests , both military and economic in the whole world			0
" the @entity91 is the site of the @entity31 @entity93			0
in 2008 , @entity95 kidnapped @entity96 diplomat @entity94 on @entity67 's orders and held him for 130 days , @entity94 told @entity0 after his release			0
@entity31 minister : @entity101 ' heavy weapons found in @entity21 analyst : focus likely will be on @entity104 " such threats have been made before by @entity5 and his commanders and associates but they have not yet demonstrated a capacity to launch attacks in the @entity110			1
for the time being , it 's more likely they will focus on hitting @entity110 targets in the @entity104 region , " @entity111 , an analyst who closely tracks the group , told @entity0			0
belmoktar himself is seen providing encouragement to the jihadists about to attack the @entity31 mine and @entity122 military academy in may			2
another commander , @entity124 , appeals for ' lone wolf ' attacks in @entity31			2
he talks of the young @entity31 - @entity10 man -- @entity128 -- who carried out a string of gun atttacks in the @entity31 city of @entity132 last year , killing seven people			1
@entity128 was later cornered and killed by @entity31 police in his apartment			0
" to every @entity61 brother , " says @entity136 , " whether his nationality is @entity10 or @entity139 or @entity140 ... i believe they walk on the street and make the @entity31 people scared ...			1
. so the @entity61 youth inside @entity31 have a great duty , even if it is with a stone or knife " to hit a @entity31 , according to a translation by the @entity149			0
the video was made available to @entity0 by @entity151 , an outfit tracking jihadist websites			1
it has since appeared on @entity154			0
it shows jihadists operating in the northern @entity21 cities of @entity158 and @entity159 earlier this year , and the application of strict @entity162 law			0
and it shows an interview with a man described of @entity31 - @entity167 origin , who was detained by @entity5 's group for drinking alcohol			1
he says he will be judged by @entity162 law and will never drink alcolohol again			0
the @entity31 intervention in @entity21 , which began in january and was aimed at defeating jihadist groups that had seized much of the north of the country , has subdued , but not eliminated , the threat from @entity67 and allied jihadist groups			2
one source briefed by @entity110 and regional intelligence officials told @entity181 is believed to have moved to the triangle regions straddling the borders of @entity10 , @entity41 and @entity184 in late 2012 after signs that an international intervention in @entity21 was growing more likely			1
known as the " @entity189 pass , " the area is a key transit points for drug traffickers and international criminal groups			0
some counterterrorism analysts believe @entity5 may have relocated in southern @entity184 , where an absence of state authority gives him room to regroup			1
@entity0 previously learned that @entity5 had visited to @entity184 after the uprising against @entity198 and established ties with the emerging jihadist groups there			1
intelligence sources told @entity0 earlier this year that he may also have had a role in the attack on the @entity63 diplomatic compound in @entity205 exactly a year ago			2
according to one source , militants in the area called him up in @entity21 shortly after the attack and offered congratulations			2
the call , which was intercepted , did not however provide proof of his involvement			0
working with other @entity59 affiliates according to analysts , the new video , which includes computer animations of attacks , is one of the most sophisticated yet produced by @entity59 fighters in the region and should be seen as part of @entity5 's pitch to have @entity224 recognize his group as the stand alone @entity59 affiliate in the @entity104			1
the video also confirms the presence in @entity21 of fighters from @entity122 , where @entity231 and @entity232 have been involved in a campaign of sabotage and suicide attacks against police , government officials and @entity238			1
there were reports earlier this year that @entity122 jihadists had joined @entity59 in the city of @entity158 , in eastern @entity21			0
a fighter in a black and yellow headscarf who calls himself @entity246 says : " to my mujahedeen brothers everywhere and in @entity122 in particular , i say to you : wherever you find them , attack them and kill them			2
" last year , simmering tension between @entity67 and @entity59 's paramount leader @entity254 , who is based in northern @entity10 , burst into the open -- leading to @entity5 's dismissal from the @entity258 affiliate 's leadership			1
but this video suggests @entity5 's group is again joining forces with other @entity59 affiliates across the region			1
the video features clips from speeches by @entity267 , a leader of @entity269 ( @entity269 ) , as well as from @entity270 and @entity271			2
@entity5 has a deep file of jihadist contacts across the region because of the time he spent fighting with other @entity275 fighters in @entity276 in the early 1990s , which analysts say he is likely to continue to leverage			1
on his way back to fight in the @entity10 civil war he spent time in @entity281 , where he made contacts in militant circles			1
since the @entity287 , according to western counter-terrorism sources , @entity284 and @entity281 jihadists have consolidated their connections			0
those officials say three @entity281 fighters who belonged to @entity269 participated in the attack on the @entity63 compound in @entity205 and then fled to northern @entity21 where they connected with @entity5 's group			1
and , this month , three @entity184 were arrested in the @entity281 capital , @entity294 , suspected of belonging to @entity269			0
there appears to be a growing effort by @entity59 's leadership -- and not just by individual jihadists -- to improve co-operation among the various arms of the group			2
in 2012 @entity269 leader @entity302 , who was recently appointed @entity59 's global no , 2 , sent several letters to @entity59 emir @entity254 which were subsequently discovered by the @entity306 in northern @entity21			0
they indicated that @entity302 had emerged as a bridge for communications between @entity59 figures in @entity311 and the @entity284 group			0
@entity59 document sheds light on attack plans			0

jihadist @entity5 appears to be back on the stage
he had claimed responsibility for a deadly attack on an @entity10 gas facility
in video , he trains fighters and pays tribute to fallen commander
