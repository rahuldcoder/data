" in a world where athletes and celebrities seem more willing to attach their names to high - priced sneakers and headphones than real - world issues , many are thrusting themselves directly into an uncomfortable national debate over police brutality and racial injustice			1
it 's not only people with prominent names ; there are medical students , congressional staffers , a university president and even a @entity25 police chief			1
a spate of controversial police slayings of unarmed black men served as the catalyst			1

according to @entity42 's lawyer , the officer says he did n't use a chokehold on @entity31			1
the outpouring started in earnest one week before the @entity32 decision , with the long - awaited announcement of a grand jury 's decision not to indict @entity54 , @entity55 , police officer @entity56 in the shooting death of unarmed teen @entity58			1
that decision was met with violent demonstrations in @entity54 and largely peaceful protests throughout the nation			0

police chief and university president that groundswell seems to have peaked with the nonindictment in the @entity31 case			1
as they warmed up for a game monday attended by the @entity89 and @entity90 , @entity85 @entity84 and @entity86 were among players wearing t - shirts saying " i ca n't breathe " -- @entity31 's last words , which have become a rallying cry for protesters			1

@entity161 sen. @entity160 , a @entity162 and one of two african - americans in the @entity165 , last week posted a column to his @entity168 page that he wrote for the @entity169 as a university student after the @entity172 verdict in 1992			0
" i 'm struggling to be articulate , loquacious , positive , constructive , but for the first time in so long , i have lost control of my emotions , " he wrote then			0
emotions once suppressed , emotions once channeled , now are let loose			0
why ? " he continued , " not guilty ... not shocked			0
i 'm a black man			2
i am 6 feet 3 inches tall and 230 pounds , just like @entity172			0

the failure to get indictments in the @entity58 , @entity31 and other racially charged cases was " like lightning striking the black community over and over and over again			1
" " @entity211 has not seen protests like those that are coming if justice does n't start to come down , " he said			0
" we have not begun to engage the young leaders who are waiting to go to work			0
