in february , a statement from @entity3 's government described the island as " the under - protected front in the nation 's war on drugs			1
" after this week 's airport raid , officials in the commonwealth renewed their rallying cries			1
" we have been asking the federal government to help us patrol ... the @entity3 coasts , which we are unable to cover entirely by ourselves , " gov. @entity61 said wednesday			2
" we want them to help us protect it in the same way they protect the borders with @entity68 and @entity69			0
" on a national level , some lawmakers have taken note			0
a congressional hearing to discuss the situation is scheduled for later this month			0
" the disturbing increase in drug trafficking and drug - related violence in this region ... is alarming and unacceptable , " @entity75 , a @entity76 congressman from @entity77 who will chair the june 21 hearing , said in a statement			1
" if this kind of violence were happening anywhere else where 4 million @entity26 citizens resided , it would make daily headlines			2
this problem is no less serious than drug cartels operating across the @entity68 border			0
" facing ' widespread fear ' a group of gunmen burst into a bar on its opening night , spraying bullets at a crowd of revelers			0

" violence by drug traffickers in the region has become indiscriminate , endangering the lives of public housing residents and innocent bystanders , " the 2011 report said , describing " widespread fear among the general population			2

now @entity138 is president of @entity152 , a nonprofit that has created a smartphone application to help the island 's residents report crimes to police			0
in @entity160 , the group 's name means " enough already , " representing its efforts to promote community action and stop the surge in violence			2
but there 's one thing that @entity138 says there is n't enough of in @entity3 : funding from the @entity26 government for the fight against drug trafficking			1
federal agencies on the ground , he argues , do n't have the tools they need to combat the growing problem			0
" it 's shameful , the neglect of @entity3 , " he says			2
a new avenue ? drug trafficking is not a new problem for the island			1
@entity3 's strategic geographic location between @entity184 and the continental @entity26 has long made the commonwealth a central drug transit hub , says @entity187 , a spokeswoman for the @entity188			1
up to 80 % of the drugs that pass through @entity3 end up in cities across the eastern seaboard of the @entity26 , officials say			1
and nearly a third of drugs destined for the continental @entity26 pass through the @entity28			2
@entity3 's @entity195 -- the site of wednesday 's raid -- is " a major gateway for cocaine and heroin transported " to the continental @entity26 , according to a 2011 report from the @entity125			1
because @entity3 is a commonwealth of the @entity26 , passengers from there do n't have to go through customs upon arriving on the mainland			1
but some analysts say a new trend may be pushing even more cargo containers , fishing boats and yachts with hidden compartments toward @entity3 's shores from @entity184 ( often by way of the @entity213 )			1
faced with increased security at the @entity68 - @entity26 border , cartels may be searching for other trafficking routes , some analysts and officials speculate			1
" if you attack one front , if you put your resources there , they search for other avenues , and the @entity28 is one of those avenues , " says @entity220 , an attorney and former deputy @entity221 in @entity3			2
that 's a case that @entity229 , @entity3 's resident commissioner in @entity49 , has made for months as he 's pushed for a " @entity230 , " similar to efforts to fight drug trafficking along @entity26 borders with @entity68 and @entity69 , calling for a boost in resources and personnel to match " the scope and severity of the drug - related violence			1
" since 2008 , the @entity26 has pledged $ 1.6 billion in aid to @entity68 as part of the @entity243 , aimed at helping @entity68 combat cartels and organized crime			2
in that same period , @entity3 has received roughly $ 260 million to fund various addiction recovery , police and judicial programs , according to a recent estimate using government figures			2
but some have cautioned against placing too much emphasis on law enforcement , who are often accused of corruption and abuse in @entity3			2
in 2010 , an @entity258 investigation into whether police provided protection for drug dealers led to the arrest of 89 law enforcement officers in @entity3			2
and a september @entity26 @entity264 report said that the @entity265 had a long pattern of violating citizens ' constitutional rights through excessive force and unwarranted searches			2
low public trust in @entity3 's police , fueled by a troubling history of abuses by law enforcement , makes it harder to stem the violence , said @entity278 , a human rights researcher at the @entity279			1
" they are confronting a serious public safety crisis , but the problem is that , instead of limiting the violence , they 're contributing to the violence			0
... the police department uses the public safety crisis as an excuse for the abuses they 're committing , " she said			0
@entity3 's governor has said he is working with officials to reform the police department			1
he appointed a new police superintendent in march			0
" the problem ca n't be controlled only with policing measures , " says @entity295 , a professor at the @entity296 who has researched drug trafficking in the region			1
more economic and social programs are just as important to solving @entity3 's drug problems , he says , which also include a significant population of drug addicts and far - reaching criminal networks			1
analysts once calculated that there were nearly 100 criminal organizations that were connected with drug trafficking in @entity3 , he says			1
" it is an enormous business			0
we are talking about a business that possibly is bigger than the amount of tourism coming in to @entity3 , " he says			2
a flourishing underground economy drug traffickers have a fertile recruiting ground in @entity3 , where unemployment has been hovering around 15 % , and labor participation is around 40 % ( meaning 4 out of 10 people work ) , according to the @entity324			1
" having lost their direct employment , many people turn to working in the informal economy , " says economist @entity325 , who describes drug - trafficking as a " significant component " of @entity3 's underground economy			1
" it 's a public policy challenge that is impacting the country 's security , " he said			0
little research has been done to study the underground economy 's impact on the residents of @entity3 's more than 330 public housing projects , says @entity340 , a sociologist and professor at the @entity342 in the @entity213			1
" we are talking about communities that are basically living from informal work , " says @entity340 , who has studied similar neighborhoods in the @entity213 and will begin a fellowship researching @entity3 's public housing projects in the fall			1
leaders at drug distribution points inside the projects often pay children to move drugs , according to the @entity125 's 2011 report on @entity3			1
@entity138 , the president of @entity152 , says that reality is painfully clear when he speaks with children as part of his advocacy work			0
" if you 're a drug runner you get paid $ 500 a day			0
why would that guy want to go to school ? ... they know that they 're gon na die young , but they 're gon na take care of their mom with a lot of money			0
that 's what happens when you allow this sort of problem , " he says			0
a 10 - year - old boy told @entity138 he wanted to grow up to be a drug lord 's triggerman .			0
