-- @entity1 divided over an ongoing political crisis agree on one thing -- they do n't think very highly of their leaders , according to a new survey			1
almost half of @entity1 polled -- 48 percent -- said they disapproved of the job president @entity9 was doing before he was ousted in a coup on june 28 , said the 2009 @entity12 survey			1
the man who assumed power after the coup , de facto president @entity13 , received a disapproval rating of 65 percent for how he has handled the crisis , according to the survey			1
the annual @entity12 survey , named after the @entity21 - based non-profit company of the same name , is among the most highly regarded polls in the region			1
this year , the poll asked a number of questions that shed light on how @entity1 and other @entity29 viewed the political crisis in @entity1			1
a new @entity1 president , @entity31 , was elected last month , though the international community is split on whether to recognize him because the vote took place under the rule of the de facto government			2
an agreement between negotiators for @entity9 and @entity13 had been reached earlier , but lost much credibility when its implementation did n't go as planned			0
@entity9 , who remains holed up inside the @entity42 embassy in the @entity1 capital ever since covertly sneaking back into his country in september , has called the plan dead			1
several attempts to find a resolution failed , despite strong international criticism of the coup			0
" it can be said that the force of rejection of all the international organizations , which were raised in a singular voice against the coup and in favor of the restitution of the constitutionally elected president , were ineffective against the local political forces that had expelled @entity9 in an ignominious manner , " the survey said			1
the political crisis stemmed from @entity9 's desire to hold a referendum that could have changed the constitution to allow longer terms for the president			1
the country 's congress had outlawed the vote , and the supreme court had ruled it illegal			0
@entity13 and his supporters say @entity9 's removal was a constitutional transfer of power and not a coup			2
according to @entity12 , 58 percent of @entity1 disapproved of the coup , while another 28 percent said they approved of @entity9 's ouster			1
those more heavily in favor of the coup included those with a higher education and the elderly , the survey found			0
of those with university degrees , 40 percent approved of the coup , compared with 27 percent approval among those with only a basic education , the survey said			0
@entity9 faced long odds of returning to the presidency because the supreme court and congress , including lawmakers from his own party , were against his calls for the referendum that led to his ouster			0
these political power brokers , and in general , the @entity1 elite that backed @entity13 , likely account for the discrepancy between education level and views of the coup			2
in @entity1 , the elite are more likely to have completed university than others			0
the low approval ratings for @entity9 point to his thin election victory in 2005 , according to @entity12			1
the leftist @entity9 was elected with just under 50 percent of the vote			2
that margin hardly gave him a mandate to push the sweeping constitutional reforms he wanted , the survey said			0
" @entity9 wanted to implement reforms that were beyond what the majority supported , " the report said			0
outside of @entity1 , 24 percent of respondents in the other @entity125 countries approved of the coup , the @entity12 survey found			1
asked to rate @entity1 democracy on a scale of 1 to 10 , those outside of the country said the @entity133 nation merited a 5.2 , the survey said			2
it was the first time that the firm asked for people to give their perception of democracy in a country that was not their own			0
@entity12 also asked respondents in the region whether they believed a coup was possible in their own country			2
the highest affirmative responses came from countries that have left - leaning presidents			0
@entity147 ( 36 percent ) , @entity42 ( 34 percent ) and @entity146 ( 30 percent ) said a coup was possible in their country .			0
