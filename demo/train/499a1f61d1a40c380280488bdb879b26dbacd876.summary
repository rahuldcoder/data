-- major pharmaceutical companies are increasingly looking to harness @entity3 's opportunity , lured by an emerging middle class across the continent 's growing urban centers			1
although the total size of the @entity3 market is still small compared to other global regions , analysts say that the continent 's big cities hold the key to unlocking the industry 's lucrative potential			1
in such areas , increasing individual wealth , coupled with a stronger health system infrastructure and a rising demand for drugs treating chronic diseases , are driving demand for pharmaceuticals , say analysts			1
" urban centers have the highest concentration of the segments of the population that are more likely to be relatively wealthy , more likely to be educated and also possibly more likely to suffer from the chronic diseases of affluence that are becoming increasingly important in @entity3 , " says @entity25 , director of thought leadership at @entity27			1

by 2020 , the market could represent a $ 45 billion opportunity for drug makers , spurred in part by robust economic growth and demographic changes			2
this can only be good news for people like @entity50 , owner of @entity51 in @entity52 , just outside @entity53 in @entity3			2
" the pharmaceutical business is growing and it will grow , " says @entity50			0
" it 's the next big thing in @entity3			2
" @entity50 says his profits have soared over the last decade			0
" we have a lot of potential in @entity3 , " he adds			2
according to the @entity60 ( @entity60 ) , @entity3 is home to 11 % of the world 's population , yet accounts for 24 % of the global disease burden			1
but while infectious illnesses such as hiv / aids and tuberculosis still remain a major problem , the continent is also expected to experience a surge in demand for treatment of non-communicable diseases ( @entity73 ) , such as cardiovascular and respiratory disorders as well as cancer and diabetes , in the coming years			1
the @entity60 estimates that by 2020 the biggest increases in @entity73 deaths will occur in @entity3			2
" we 're seeing a movement of volume towards more products that treat chronic diseases , " says @entity25			0
" as urban populations are becoming wealthier , they 're more likely to have a @entity88 diet , they 're living longer and they 're going to suffer the kind of chronic diseases that @entity88 individuals suffer			0
" a 2011 report by the @entity93 said that @entity3 's middle class -- defined as people spending between $ 2 and $ 20 a day at 2005 prices -- increased to 34 % of the continent 's population in 2010 -- nearly 313 million people			1
the continent 's urban population is also projected to exceed that of @entity103 and @entity104 by 2050 , according to @entity106 figures			1
next to major market - leading multinationals such as @entity110 and @entity111 , which traditionally have had a strong presence in the continent , a diverse mix of drug manufacturers have made significant inroads in recent years			0
@entity104 and @entity103 companies have more than doubled their imports to @entity3 over the last decade			0
in addition , some local players in @entity3 and northern @entity118 have also had success , reaping the benefits of an already established market			0
in 2011 , @entity3 , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 accounted for more than half of the continent 's pharmaceutical sales			1
it 's not surprising , then , that major cities in these countries are expected to be at the forefront of the industry 's growth			0
according to @entity27 , between 20 - 30 % of @entity3 's $ 30 billion opportunity in 2016 will be driven by the top 10 cities in the continent -- all of them in @entity3 and northern @entity118 , with the exception of @entity139 in @entity140			1
excluding @entity3 and northern @entity118 , 10 major @entity118 cities make up another 12 % of the 2016 forecast			2
" there is a rapidly growing opportunity across @entity3 , not just in the markets that are well established , " says @entity25			0
" growth is strong and the macroeconomic indicators are that growth will continue to be strong over the next 10 years and probably beyond			0
" read this : african ceos look to bright future yet companies keen to tap @entity3 's pharmaceutical opportunity must overcome several challenges whilst operating in a diverse and heterogeneous market , made up of more than 50 countries , different languages , varied regulations and unequal levels of infrastructure development			1
amid such challenges , the industry is also keeping an eye on the substantial threat posed by counterfeit drug makers , who are also trying to benefit from @entity3 's expanding demand for modern medicines			1
" frankly , the presence of counterfeit keeps me up at night , " admits @entity168 , managing executive for the @entity3 region for @entity170 , a @entity3 pharmaceutical company			2
" we 've had instances of counterfeit in @entity176 , so far that 's where we found counterfeit			0
you 've got to live with it , in that we ca n't eradicate it completely , but we 've got to stay on top of finding a counterfeit and bringing its presence to the authorities			0
" still , despite these challenges , insiders say the industry 's future is bright			0
" without a shadow of a doubt , " says @entity168			0
" i 'd say that there is a boom and it 's going to get even stronger as the middle class grows			1
and i think you 've got to be on the ground now to be able to win in this segment			0
