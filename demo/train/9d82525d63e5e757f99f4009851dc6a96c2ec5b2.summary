not long ago , the threat of terrorist attacks against the @entity2 boiled down to two words : @entity4			1
but this week 's @entity2 airstrikes against @entity4 offshoots show the president is playing whack - a - mole against a new generation of terrorists			1
the attacks tuesday inside @entity12 came in three waves and targeted @entity14 , the @entity15 and , apparently , @entity16			1
the groups share a similar ideology			0
but there are key differences			0
here 's how each stacks up : @entity14 what its name means : the @entity25 in @entity26 and @entity12			2
some world leaders use the acronym @entity29 , or the @entity29			0
but the group now calls itself just the @entity25 , believing it has already established a caliphate across @entity33 parts of @entity12 and @entity26			0
how it started : back in 2004 , @entity34 launched @entity4 in @entity26			1
he later tried to ignite a sectarian war against @entity26 's @entity37 majority			0
the new @entity4 group was rebranded in 2006 as the @entity25 in @entity26			2
it would add " and @entity12 " to its name later			0
the group exploited a growing perception among many @entity33 that they were being persecuted by @entity26 's @entity37 - dominated government , starved of resources and excluded from a share of power			0
what its goal is : @entity14 has been trying to create an @entity29 state across @entity33 areas of @entity26 and in @entity12			2
but it does n't stop there , one former @entity14 militant told @entity54			2
" the main and principal goal of the @entity25 that they tell their new members is to establish an @entity29 state that will encompass the @entity62 world , " the @entity56 fighter said			0
" and after that , we go to other countries			0
" the group also claims its leader has authority over 1.5 billion muslims around the world			0
who leads it : @entity73 took the reins of @entity14 in 2010 at age 39 after the previous leader , @entity76 , was killed in a joint @entity2 - @entity26 operation			1
prior to taking over @entity14 , @entity73 was part of @entity4 in @entity26			1
he served four years in a @entity2 prison camp for insurgents , at @entity81 in southern @entity26 , where he likely developed a network of contacts and honed his ideology			2
he was released in 2009 and went to work			0
why the @entity2 is targeting it : @entity14 has been pretty vocal about wanting to attack @entity2 and other @entity87 -- even though @entity2 officials say @entity14 fighters are n't a direct threat to the @entity2 homeland right now			1
" at this point , we have no information that @entity29 is plotting an attack inside the @entity2 , " @entity92 , director of the @entity93 , testified to @entity94 last week			1
the dangers , officials say , are to @entity2 personnel and infrastructure in @entity26			2
there 's also a risk of militants with @entity2 or other @entity87 passports potentially returning home and staging attacks			2
a senior @entity14 leader recently called for lone - wolf attacks in the @entity2 and @entity109 -- two countries that have been conducting airstrikes against @entity14 in @entity26			1
" the best thing you can do is to strive to your best and kill any disbeliever , whether he be @entity109 , @entity2 or from any of their allies , " the @entity14 official said			1
" rig the roads with explosives for them			0
do not let them feel secure			0
@entity130 them wherever they may be			0
" inside the mind of an @entity14 fighter @entity16 what its name means : " @entity16 " is translated from " @entity16 , " which means " @entity138			1
" how it started : @entity16 was formed during the ongoing three - year @entity141 civil war			2
it has emerged as one of the most effective groups fighting the @entity141 regime , drawing on foreign fighters with combat experience in @entity26 and elsewhere			0
" a number of separate rebel groups have emerged and preparations are being made for a @entity12 as these groups vie for dominance and international support , " the @entity148 said			0
what its goal is : unlike most @entity141 rebels , which are seeking political change , @entity16 is fighting for ideological reasons			2
like @entity14 , @entity16 is trying to establish an @entity29 state -- though primarily in @entity12			1
it 's been a formidable force against president @entity164 's regime			0
but even though it has helped the @entity141 opposition by taking out regime fighters , it has also hurt the moderate opposition by making world leaders hesitant to help rebels			0
the group has claimed hundreds of attacks in several cities , including suicide bombings , and is responsible for the deaths of " numerous innocent @entity141 , " the @entity171 said			0
who leads it : @entity16 posted a statement saying its leader , @entity180 , was killed in the @entity2 - led airstrikes tuesday in @entity12			1
the statement was accompanied by a so - called proof of death -- a photograph -- of the former fighter			0
@entity54 can not independently verify @entity16 's claims , but the monitoring group the @entity188 reported the terror group was among those targeted during the airstrikes			1
why the @entity2 is targeting it : the @entity2 has not identified @entity16 as a group targeted in its strikes in @entity12			1
but it is a rebel group that the @entity2 has blacklisted as a foreign terror organization linked to @entity4 in @entity26			1
@entity16 " has sought to portray itself as part of the legitimate @entity141 opposition while it is , in fact , an attempt by @entity29 to hijack the struggles of the @entity141 people for its own malign purposes , " the @entity171 said			2
the @entity205 what its name means : calling the group " @entity209 " does n't actually make sense in @entity211 or any other language , according to the @entity213			0
" @entity209 is not an organizational name or even some exotic acronym , but an ancient @entity29 historical term from the far east of the @entity219 world , " the think tank said			0
" it is used today by @entity4 ( and others who are fond of archaic @entity29 terminology ) to describe the @entity226 - @entity225 - @entity224 region			2
" how it started : the new @entity4 franchise is a collection of @entity4 members who have moved into @entity12			2
@entity2 president @entity231 called the @entity15 " seasoned @entity4 operatives			1
" @entity209 's existence was publicly acknowledged only last week , when @entity2 director of national intelligence @entity234 said it was operating in @entity26 and @entity12 with a focus on exporting terror to the @entity238			1
what its goal is : the @entity15 's mission is to find new ways to attack the @entity2 and @entity243			1
for @entity4 , which is struggling against @entity14 for the crown of leading global jihad , the creation of @entity209 makes perfect sense			1
sources say the @entity15 is trying to emulate the success of @entity14 in using social media to recruit @entity87 -- people who could be trained and then sent home to launch terror attacks			1
who leads it : a short and slight 33 - year - old named @entity258 , according to intelligence sources in the @entity2 and the @entity257			0
he arrived in @entity12 in april 2013 and began working with @entity16			0
at some point , he parted ways with @entity16			0
why the @entity2 is targeting it : the @entity15 was actively plotting against a @entity2 homeland target and @entity87 targets , a senior @entity2 official told @entity54 on tuesday			1
the intelligence community discovered the plots against the @entity2 in the past week , an intelligence source told @entity54			1
the source did not say what the @entity15 's target may have been , but said the plot may have involved a bomb made of clothes dipped in explosive material			0
the @entity2 blitz on @entity15 targets this week came a surprise to many			1
the @entity2 wanted to catch the group off guard by mixing strikes against it with strikes against @entity14 targets .			1

@entity14 , @entity16 and the @entity15 all *spawned* from @entity4
the @entity2 launched airstrikes against @entity14 and the @entity15 this week
@entity16 says its leader was killed in the strikes ; the @entity2 has not confirmed
