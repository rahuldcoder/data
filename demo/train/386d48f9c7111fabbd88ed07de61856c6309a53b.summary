the @entity1 government said thursday it is expelling a person it describes as the representative of @entity5 foreign intelligence services based at the @entity6 in @entity7			1
the move comes after two allegations emerged of @entity1 spying for the @entity5 over the last week , claims prompting an investigation by @entity1 prosecutors of a suspect accused of passing secrets			1
the call comes against the background of the current investigation by the federal prosecutor and questions that have remained unresolved for months about the activity of @entity5 intelligence in @entity1			0
" the @entity1 government views these events as very serious , " government spokesman @entity22 said			1
in a statement , @entity22 stressed the importance of " mutual trust and openness			1
" " it remains essential for @entity1 , in the interest of the security of its citizens and its armed forces abroad , to cooperate closely on the basis of trust with its western partners , in particular with the @entity5			1
" @entity22 said the government " is ready to offer that , and expects its closest partners to do the same			0
" @entity1 prosecutors said wednesday they are investigating a suspect accused of passing secrets			0
" officers of the federal criminal office have since this morning searched the living and office rooms of an accused in the @entity7 area because of initial suspicion of secret service agency activity			0
they said " an arrest did not take place			0
" as a matter of policy , @entity53 spokesman @entity52 declined to comment on the reported intelligence activity			1
" the reason for that is there 's an important principle at stake , which is declining to comment on them publicly allows for the sufficient protection of our national interests , in some cases the intelligence assets , and more generally , @entity5 national security , " he said			0
only last week , @entity1 prosecutors ordered the arrest of a @entity1 citizen on suspicion of spying for foreign intelligence agencies			2
on friday , the @entity1 foreign office called in the @entity5 ambassador to discuss it			0
both the @entity1 prosecutor and the foreign office released scarce information then , but officials have spoken in detail with @entity1 journalists , who published many reports on the allegations of @entity5 spying on the country			2
" if the reports are correct , it would be a serious case			2
if the allegations are true , it would be for me a clear contradiction to what i consider to be a trustful cooperation between agencies and partners , " said @entity1 chancellor @entity87			1
her warning came as @entity5 - @entity1 relations are already shaky in the aftermath of disclosures by @entity100 leaker @entity99 that showed the @entity5 was listening in on @entity87 's phone calls			1
former @entity5 secretary of state @entity104 , in an interview tuesday with the @entity1 news site @entity103 , said both countries need to talk about what intelligence collection should be allowed and what might thwart intelligence and security cooperation			0
" clearly , the surveillance on chancellor @entity87 's phone was absolutely wrong , " she said			2
@entity1 and other friendly countries complained when @entity99 's leaks last year revealed @entity5 surveillance of foreign leaders as well as screening of foreign phone calls and @entity121 contacts in investigating terrorist ties			0
the @entity124 administration responded that all countries conduct surveillance on each other , but the president also has ordered changes in @entity5 programs			0
