@entity0 -- four more deaths have been confirmed by @entity4 health officials friday bringing the total number of @entity7 deaths from an e. coli outbreak to 31			1
all but one were in @entity9			0
according to @entity4 health authorities the bacteria has been traced to sprouts found in a @entity14 household in western @entity9			1
this is the first time the actual bacteria has been found in produce			1
the number of people infected with @entity20 now stands at 2,988 , of whom 759 have the severe form of the intestinal illness			1
though the rate of infection is slowing , officials at the @entity25 said the number of infections will continue to rise			0
a spokesman for the @entity4 ministry of consumer affairs said sprouts were tested in the home when two members of the family became infected after eating the sprouts			1
the vegetables in question seem to originate from a farm in @entity9 that has already been linked to the outbreak , ministry spokesman @entity42			0
investigators determined bean sprouts were the cause of the outbreak after 17 people became ill after eating at the same restaurant , @entity43 , president of the @entity25 , told reporters			1
authorities questioned people about what they ate and asked the cooks where the ingredients came from , @entity43 said			2
the common denominator , he said , was only those who ate food containing the sprouts became ill. farmers in @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 have been seeking compensation for their losses			2
the @entity68 has proposed that the @entity69 pay about $ 300 million , but @entity62 alone claims about $ 600 million in losses			0
in @entity62 , the fresh produce exporter @entity72 filed what is believed to be the first lawsuit by a @entity62 company against the @entity77 state government over its earlier allegations that @entity62 products were to blame for the @entity20 outbreak			2
the complaint , filed thursday in @entity77 , demands the immediate release of all laboratory tests and other documentation that @entity77 officials used when they blamed -- wrongly it turns out -- @entity72 's organic cucumbers as a source of the outbreak , @entity72 's owner , @entity86 , told @entity1 by phone on friday			0
@entity72 , based in @entity62 's southern @entity92 province , expects to file another lawsuit against the @entity77 state government seeking 1 million euros ( $ 144 million ) in losses from fresh produce it had to destroy , @entity86 said			0
" my company was named specifically " by @entity4 authorities , @entity86 said			1
his exports remain blocked because even as @entity4 and @entity68 officials have cleared @entity62 cucumbers generally of any link to the outbreak , there remains suspicion among his clients since his firm was identified , wrongly , as a source of the bacteria , he said			1
" we do n't want to be collateral damage			0
we want a specific rectification , " @entity86 said			0
the lawsuit is the first of its kind by a @entity62 company against @entity4 authorities , said @entity116 , managing director of @entity62 's fresh produce export federation @entity118			1
@entity72 grows relatively few cucumbers ; its speciality is premium tomatoes for export			0
@entity86 said he was not confident that his firm would receive any public compensation , which is why it filed the lawsuit against @entity4 authorities			2
@entity1 's @entity126 and @entity127 contributed to this report .			0
