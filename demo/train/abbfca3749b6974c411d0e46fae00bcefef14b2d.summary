-- a few months ago , the @entity1 , a @entity2 - based nonprofit that does amazing work in the field of poverty and social exclusion , issued a surprising report that deserves a much wider readership			0
the study evaluated the success of a radical new way of working with the long - term homeless			2
instead of soup kitchens , shelters , and mobile health clinics , the charity @entity14 simply selected 15 homeless people that their outreach workers had found the hardest to reach ( one had been on the streets for an astonishing 45 years ) , asked them what it was they needed to change their lives -- and then bought it for them			1
one asked for sneakers and a prepaid cell phone , one needed cash to pay off a loan , one wanted a tv and a comfy chair ( to make the move into hostel accommodation more attractive ) , and one requested a camper van			0
each of them received the money to purchase exactly what they asked for , with the condition that they also had to choose a personal " broker " who would help them write a budget			0
good : " @entity47 " teaches @entity45 how to walk in the city two refused to engage with the pilot project altogether , but of the 13 who agreed to take part , 11 are now off the streets			1
several have entered treatment for addiction and mental health issues , some have reconnected with their families , and all are exhibiting an enhanced ability to function independently in society ( i.e. paying bills , signing up for welfare , and turning up for training courses , etc. )			1
the participants ' own comments give a clue as to why the intervention worked so well : i 've got a 32 - inch telly and a dvd			0
i 've come a long way from the street ! the option of going to homeless organizations [ for support ] did n't enter my mind			2
i know i 'm an entirely different creature from most homeless people			1
i did n't just go for the most expensive , i did it as if it was my money			0
i 'm getting into thinking more [ about how the money is spent ]			0
i 've got to be honest here , it was n't just the individual budget , it was the fact there was [ co-ordinator ] there as well ... we was meeting [ regularly ] to discuss it , and i 'd actually gone from the stage of wanting nothing to do with these people , to actually looking forward to seeing them			2
good : the 10 most wildly racist things from this @entity98 protest this was only a small - scale pilot project , but its results are compelling and make a lot of sense			2
@entity14 's outreach workers , some of whom confessed that they were initially afraid that the homeless people would " milk " the system or spend the money on drugs , testified to the power of treating each person as an individual , respecting their autonomy , and helping them to build a relationship of trust and accountability with an " establishment " figure			1
the upfront expense of a budget and the cost of providing personalized one - on - one " broker " support are easily outweighed by the amount the taxpayer will spend over time on police , prison , and medical bills ( at least in the @entity2 , where the study was carried out and where social services are more generous )			0
this month , the pilot is being expanded to become a central part of @entity14 's regular outreach efforts in the @entity138 ; it will be fascinating to see whether these kinds of successes can be replicated on a larger scale			1

of the 13 homeless people who agreed to take part , 11 are now off the streets
the 13 are exhibiting an enhanced ability to function independently in society
the pilot is being expanded this month to become a central part of @entity14 's outreach efforts
