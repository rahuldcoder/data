they 're bigger , brawnier , and faster than the typical male , but are @entity3 players healthier than other men their age ? @entity6 , who plays for the @entity7 , participated in the study on @entity3 players			1
yes and no , according to a new @entity3 - funded study that looks at the cardiovascular health of young athletes			1
the good news is that @entity3 players have cholesterol levels similar to other men in their 20s and 30s , and their blood sugar tends to be even healthier			1
however , they are much more likely to have high blood pressure or borderline hypertension when compared with men who are n't professional athletes			1
" it 's a step in the right direction to have this study , " says @entity6 , 30 , who plays defensive tackle for the @entity7 and took part in the research			0
" i think the more information we can find out and the more studies we can do , the better			0
" the study , published this week in the @entity32 , is important , particularly as more and more players are weighing in at 300 - plus pounds			1
the extra weight could potentially strain an athlete 's heart in youth or even after retirement , and many question whether it has played a role in a handful of high - profile deaths			1
@entity44 : eat right advice : fiber , starch , fats , serving sizes in particular , the death of @entity51 at age 23 has raised concerns about the heart health of larger players			1
@entity51 , who was 6 ' 3 " and 330 pounds , had just finished an exhibition game with the @entity58 when he collapsed and died in 2005			1
" he 's sort of the prototype of the bigger , stronger linemen that populates the @entity3 now , as compared with 20 or 30 years ago , " says lead study author dr. @entity65 , the team physician for the @entity7			2
" we have so many big , strong guys over 300 pounds			2
i think that case in particular was important in stimulating the whole study and the investigation			0
" other heavy players -- such as defensive end @entity72 -- have also died at an early age			2
@entity72 was 43 when he died from cardiac arrhythmia in 2004			0
in the study , @entity65 , who is the cochair of the @entity3 subcommittee on cardiovascular health , and his colleagues looked at 504 active players from 12 teams in 2007			1
the researchers measured the players ' height , weight , percentage of body fat , and other factors , and then compared them to 1,959 men ages 23 to 35 who participated in a study called @entity92 ( @entity93 in @entity94 )			1
@entity44 : 20 little ways to lose drop the pounds and keep them off they found that players were less likely to smoke or have blood - sugar problems than other men ( only 6.7 percent of players had impaired fasting glucose compared to 15.5 percent of other men ) and their cholesterol levels were essentially the same			1
however , 13.8 percent of players had high blood pressure and 64.5 percent had prehypertension , or borderline high blood pressure , compared to 5.5 percent and 24.2 percent of other men , respectively			1
@entity65 notes that the football players outweighed the men in the @entity92 study by an average of 70 pounds and that it 's natural to assume that larger people may have higher blood pressure			1
" but what was fascinating to us was the category of prehypertension , " says @entity65 , who is also the medical director of sports medicine at @entity119 in @entity120 , @entity121			2
@entity44 : how to eat out without getting fat the study found that @entity3 athletes are more likely to have prehypertension than other men -- regardless of the size of the player or his position			1
" so our lean players who play defensive back and wide receiver , they have prevalence of prehypertension just as common as the really big guys playing offensive and defensive line , " says @entity65			1
" so there 's something that we 're trying to investigate now that accounts for elevated blood pressures in our active players that is not accounted for by size alone -- there 's got to be something else			1
" @entity44 : cut up to 900 calories with simple substitutions that " something else " could be strength or resistance training , the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , sleep apnea ( which is characterized by heavy snoring and a hike in blood pressure ) , or diet , including excessive sodium intake			2
dr. @entity65 does n't think anabolic steroids are to blame			0
even though he and his colleagues did n't ask players if they used steroids , he says that the @entity3 's year - round testing program should have ruled out any use			1
" [ however ] i 'm concerned about the widespread use of performance - enhancing agents , which contain stimulants that can not only increase blood pressure but of course have stimulating effects on the heart , " says dr. @entity65			1
he adds that , in the last several years , such stimulants have been linked to sporadic deaths in college and even professional athletes			2
although today 's players are much more likely to weigh in excess of 300 pounds than those in the past , it does n't necessarily mean they are fat , dr. @entity65 explains			2
athletes are larger nowadays due to rule changes in the 1970s and 1980s that were aimed at protecting their lower bodies ; those guidelines also gave larger players a competitive advantage			2
if one goes by body mass index alone -- a measure of height and weight that does n't take into account muscle mass -- more than half of players are obese , according to a 2005 study			0
however , @entity65 and his team found that the average percentage of body fat was 14 percent , ranging from 8 percent to 10 percent in the leaner positions -- such as wide receivers and linebackers -- to 20 percent in defensive linemen and 25 percent in offensive linemen			0
" even our offensive linemen are really on the upper limits of what 's considered healthy , " says @entity65			0
" there are plenty of my regular patients who would take that			0
" @entity44 : @entity215 swimmer discusses life with exercise - induced asthma overall , @entity65 says he is most worried about older , retired athletes			2
" i 'm concerned about whether there is a constellation of things going on that puts them at risk when they 're 45 or 55 , " he says			0
more attention is being paid to detraining athletes so that they can adopt healthier lifestyles and better nutrition after they retire , says @entity229 , @entity230 , a professor in the department of kinesiology at the @entity233			0
" it really is tough because you 're trying to stay big in your playing days , " says @entity229			0
" the big fear is , [ after retirement ] you stop exercising and you keep eating the way you used to when you were expending a lot of calories			0
a lot of times when kids get out of college or they get out of the pros , there is no system in place that helps them make the transition			0
" the @entity7 ' @entity6 says the older generation is teaching younger players the importance of changing their lifestyle after retirement			0
" if you 're a heavier player , a lineman that 's over 300 pounds , really what it comes down to is a lifestyle change and eating healthier , losing weight when you are done , and staying active and staying healthy , " says @entity6 , who is 6 ' 3 " and 310 pounds			0
" make a few changes in your life ; i think that 's going to make things a lot better for you down the road			0
