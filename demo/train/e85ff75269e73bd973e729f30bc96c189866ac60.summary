-- back in january , vice president @entity1 summed up president @entity3 's first term with : " @entity4 is dead and @entity5 is alive			1
" at the time , the @entity3 campaign sought to emphasize the president 's record in foreign policy and saving the auto industry			1
last week , the campaign unveiled a new theme and sent @entity1 to @entity13 to test it out			1
for the first time , @entity1 called the @entity17 contenders by name and said that they would " bankrupt the middle class			1
" the campaign is now more focused on the economy , highlighting the difference between the president 's " promoting the private sector " and the @entity17 's " promoting the privileged sector			1
" the president 's political fortunes have improved , but voters are fickle			1
voters applauded @entity30 for winning the @entity31 in 1991 ; then after an economic slump , they fired him in 1992			1
if the economy keeps getting better and if president @entity3 seems to be on top of world affairs , then he will indeed win			1
conversely , if the recovery stalls or if he botches a foreign crisis , then he will probably lose			0
so how do things look ? although unemployment remains high , it has come down from its peak levels			1
other economic indicators are pointing in the right direction , too			0
in the past three years , for instance , the @entity46 has increased by about 70 %			0
on the global scene , president @entity3 has pulled out of @entity49			1
as tough as the war in @entity52 may be , it has not cost nearly as many @entity54 lives as @entity55 or @entity56			1
in any case , the administration is planning to withdraw			0
all told , things are n't great , but they were worse a few years ago			1
that 's hardly an inspiring slogan , but the reality may be sufficient for the president to get a second term			1
here 's the rub : reality can suddenly turn bad			1
in the middle of his term , president @entity67 seemed a decent bet to win re-election			2
the economy was doing ok , and he had brought the @entity73 and @entity74 together at the @entity75			2
then the revolution in @entity77 disrupted oil supplies , hiking gasoline prices and triggering an economic recession			0
the @entity77 hostage crisis initially prompted @entity54 to rally around their president , but as it dragged on , his approval ratings sank			2
although the current situation in @entity77 is n't identical , there are enough similarities to trouble the @entity88			0
uncertainty has driven up pump prices , which have slowed the rise in the president 's poll numbers			2
as @entity98 says , " you ca n't buy enough advertising to offset driving past a gas station			0
" a nuclear @entity77 would put the president 's diplomatic skills to the test			2
if he failed , he would pay a steep price on @entity103			0
so sunshine means political victory and dark skies mean defeat			0
but consider the partly cloudy scenario , where the news is bad enough to put the outcome in doubt but not so terrible as to ensure the president 's ouster			2
in such cases , messaging comes into play			0
it might move only a point or two , but in an otherwise 50 - 50 election , that margin can make the difference			1
president @entity3 's habitual response to policy problems is to say that " there is no silver bullet			2
" he should drop that line , since it sounds defeatist			0
and werewolves are the only ones that like hearing there are no silver bullets			0
instead , the classic political strategy is to go on the attack			0
as @entity141 put it : " politics is battle , and the best way to fire up your troops is to rally them against a visible opponent on the other side of the field			0
" for @entity143 , this advice means painting the @entity17 candidate as the heartless instrument of the wealthiest 1 %			0
we are already hearing such rhetoric			2
for president @entity3 , however , there is a catch			2
during the 2008 campaign , he collected millions in campaign contributions from the 1 %			0
this time out , some of them are shutting their checkbooks to him			0
moreover , the rhetoric of rich versus poor can lead to awkward moments			2
recently , vice president @entity1 accused the @entity17 of not caring about the middle class			1
critics noted that he made the remarks at a $ 10,000 - per - couple fundraiser			0
this kind of back - and - forth will count only if conditions produce a close election			1
a big margin on either side will depend largely on the economy and grand issues of war and peace			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity174			0

vice president @entity1 pitches to voters , " @entity4 is dead and @entity5 is alive "
@entity178 : presidential elections turn mostly on the big things : economy , war and peace
he says that in a close election , rhetoric can affect the margin of difference
he says that at the end of the *day* , reality trumps rhetoric
