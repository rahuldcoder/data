president @entity2 signed a bill that ends the 16 - day partial government shutdown and raises the debt ceiling , the @entity1 said early thursday morning			1
weeks of bitter political fighting gave way to a frenzied night in @entity8 as @entity9 passed the bill that would prevent the country from crashing into the debt ceiling			1
lawmakers worked precariously close to the midnight debt ceiling deadline amid warnings the government could run out of money to pay its bills if it did n't raise the debt ceiling			0
federal workers should expect to return to work thursday morning , the director of the @entity18 said			1
director @entity21 said employees should check the @entity24 's website for updates			0
@entity26 said it was already resuming operations wednesday night			0
the @entity28 - led @entity1 gave the final stamp of approval to the @entity32 - brokered bill , passing it easily late wednesday night			1
but it was n't republicans who made it happen ; a majority of that party 's caucus actually voted against the measure , which only passed because of overwhelming @entity40 support			0
read the bill a temporary bandage the debt cushion now extends through february 7 , with current spending levels being authorized through january 15			2
that means a few months of breathing room , but little more			2
after all , the bill does n't address many of the contentious and complicated issues -- from changes to entitlement programs to tax reform -- that continue to divide @entity51 and @entity28			1
" we think that we 'll be back here in january debating the same issues , " @entity52 , managing director of @entity54 's rating service , told @entity55 on wednesday night " this is , i fear , a permanent feature of our budgetary process			0
" the heads of the @entity32 and @entity1 budget committees -- @entity40 sen. @entity63 of @entity8 and @entity28 rep. @entity64 of @entity65 -- will meet thursday with an eye on addressing these budget divides			1
they 'll helm budget negotiations intended to come up with a broader spending plan for the rest of fiscal year 2014 , which ends on september 30			2
@entity2 , for one , did n't seem in the mood wednesday night for more of the same -- saying politicians in @entity8 have to " get out of the habit of governing by crisis			1
" " hopefully , next time , it will not be in the 11th hour , " @entity2 told reporters , calling for both parties to work together on a budget , immigration reform and other issues			1
as he left the podium , @entity2 was asked whether he believed @entity84 would be going through all this political turmoil again in a few months			1
his answer : " no. " come together the past 16 days of the partial government shutdown have come at a steep cost			2
@entity54 's estimated it took $ 24 billion out of the economy			0
the possibility of a debt default -- something that , @entity94 pointed out , is gone for now but not entirely -- spooked investors on @entity96 and hiked interest rates			0
and then there 's the impact the ordeal had on politicians ' image			0
if there 's one thing polls showed @entity84 agreed on , it 's that they do n't trust @entity9 -- with republicans bearing more blame than anyone else for what transpired			1
both sides talked past each other continuously , with republicans insisting for a time that defunding , delaying or otherwise altering @entity114 must be part of any final deal			0
democrats , meanwhile , stood pat in insisting they 'd negotiate -- but only after the passage of a spending bill and legislation to raise the debt without unnecessary add - ons			2
in the end , @entity51 largely got what they wanted -- after some last - minute talks by senate majority leader @entity125 and minority leader @entity126			0
" we 've been able to come together for a lot of different reasons , " said @entity125 , a @entity128 @entity127			0
republicans did get a small @entity114 concession : requiring the government to confirm the eligibility of people receiving federal subsidies under the health care program			2
but while some republicans , such as tea party favorite sen. @entity141 , claimed moral victories in energizing their movement , house speaker @entity139 did n't pretend his side was the victor			0
" we fought the good fight ; we just did n't win , " @entity139 told a radio station in his home state of @entity149			0
@entity139 to fight another day @entity40 sen. @entity151 of @entity152 blasted @entity141 and the rest of the @entity142 wing in @entity9 for what he called the " reckless , irresponsible politics of brinksmanship over the last few weeks			0
" " it was not @entity84 's finest moment , " he said			1
markets soar on agreement news of the deal brought some relief to @entity96 as well as @entity8 , with pressure to resolve the impasse building with the approach of the thursday deadline to raise the debt ceiling or face default			2
@entity84 stocks rose on the news of an agreement , with the benchmark @entity174 jumping more than 200 points on the day			1
@entity125 hailed the agreement he worked out with @entity177 as " historic , " saying that " in the end , political adversaries put aside their differences			0
" @entity177 fired an opening salvo for the budget talks expected to begin soon and continue until december when he said any ensuing spending deal should adhere to caps set in a 2011 law that included forced cuts known as sequestration			2
" preserving this law is critically important to the future of our country , " @entity177 said of the @entity189 , which resulted from the previous debt ceiling crisis in @entity8			0
the focus on an agreement shifted to the @entity32 after @entity197 failed on tuesday to come up with a plan their majority could support , stymied again by demands from tea party conservatives for outcomes unacceptable to @entity2 and @entity51 , as well as some fellow @entity28			1
rep. @entity204 compares tea party in @entity1 to ' confederates ' @entity141 , despite being in the @entity32 , is credited with spearheading the @entity1 @entity28 effort to attach amendments that would dismantle or defund the health care reforms known as @entity114 to previous proposals intended to end the shutdown			1
all were rejected by the @entity40 - led @entity32 , and @entity2 also pledged to veto them , meaning there was no chance they ever would have succeeded			1
@entity28 sen. @entity216 of @entity217 called the @entity1 @entity28 tactic of tying @entity114 to the shutdown legislation " an ill - conceived strategy from the beginning , not a winning strategy			1

federal workers can expect to return to work thursday morning
most @entity1 @entity28 vote against budget bill , but it still passes
asked whether there will be a *similar* crisis in a few months , @entity2 *flatly* says , " no "
the shutdown began on *october* 1 ; @entity84 *borrowing* authority expires on thursday
