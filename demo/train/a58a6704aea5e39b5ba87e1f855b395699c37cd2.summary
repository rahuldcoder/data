here are a few things we learned : 1			0
the @entity10 government is not backing down			1
foreign minister @entity11 took to the lectern to defend his country 's handling of the 19 - month crisis , which has spiraled into a civil war			1
he accused " some well - known countries " of pursuing " new colonial policies " under the guise of humanitarian efforts , and blamed @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and others for " arming , funding , training and harboring armed terrorist groups			1
" international calls for @entity10 president @entity32 to step down are a " blatant interference in the domestic affairs of @entity10 , " the foreign minister said			1
approximately 28,000 people have been killed in the conflict , according to the opposition , and hundreds of thousands have been forced from their homes			0
" while my government is working hard to meet the basic needs of citizens who have been forced by the violence of armed groups to flee their homes , some have sought to fabricate a refugee crisis in neighboring countries through inciting armed groups to intimidate @entity10 civilians at border areas and forcing them to flee to neighboring countries , " said @entity11			1
@entity5 debate this year largely centered around the conflict in @entity10			1
most of the international community condemns the government there , but ca n't agree on how to stop the bloodshed			0
strong @entity61 action has been blocked by longtime @entity10 supporters , @entity63 and @entity64			2
@entity65 slams the @entity67 embargo , which has been in place for more than 50 years			0
foreign minister @entity69 railed against his country 's northern neighbor , blasting the embargo that was put in place in 1960			1
@entity65 attributes much of its economic woe to the embargo , which it calls " the blockade			2
" @entity69 said the policy has caused " invaluable human and economic damage , " and accused president @entity81 of breaking promises he made in 2009			0
" the @entity67 policy towards our region , whether under @entity87 or @entity88 governments , is essentially the same			0
the promises made by the current president ... were not fulfilled , " he said , referring to @entity81 's initial pledge to lower some of the barriers in @entity93 - @entity67 relations			2
in 2009 , the @entity96 lifted some restrictions on the ability of @entity93 to visit relatives in @entity65 and send them money , but the @entity67 has kept key components of the embargo in place			0
the continued imprisonment of @entity67 contractor @entity106 , who was jailed in 2009 on suspicion of espionage , is thought to be the most recent reason why relations are not improving			0
" the @entity67 do not have the slightest moral or political authority to judge @entity65 , " @entity69 told delegates			0
the head of the @entity114 delegation says a spark could set off war on the @entity117			1
vice foreign minister @entity118 addressed delegates amid ever - present pressure on his country 's nuclear program			1
he criticized the @entity67 , claiming it wants to occupy the @entity117 and use the region as a " stepping stone for realizing its strategy of dominating the whole of @entity128			2
" " today , due to the continued @entity67 hostile policy towards @entity114 , the vicious cycle of confrontation and aggravation of tensions is on ongoing phenomenon on the @entity117 , which has become the world 's most dangerous hotspot where a spark of fire could set off a thermonuclear war , " @entity118 said			1
he recalled the december death of longtime leader @entity141			0
@entity141 's son and chosen successor , @entity143 , has taken over as " supreme leader , " though the level of his influence on policy decisions remains unclear			2
@entity118 also made mention of the country 's recent rocket launch			1
in april , @entity114 launched a rocket , which failed less than two minutes into the flight			2
it said the launch was to put a satellite into orbit , but much of the international community saw it as a cover - up for testing ballistic missile technology			0
the move destroyed a deal reached in february under which @entity163 agreed to suspend its nuclear activities in exchange for food aid shipments from the @entity67			0
" the @entity67 took issue with our legitimate and peaceful space launch that followed the universal , international law and forced the @entity61 to adopt an unjust statement , " @entity118 said			0
@entity114 has been virtually isolated from the world by international sanctions over its development of a nuclear program .			1
