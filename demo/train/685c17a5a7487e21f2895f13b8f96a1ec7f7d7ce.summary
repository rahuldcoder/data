-- let 's play one final bass - drop requiem in memory of @entity4			1
if the genre has n't already been wub - wub - wub 'd to death , @entity5 would like to smother it with its own spirit hoodie			2
true , the duo 's @entity11 and @entity12 helped spawn this new wave of harder , faster , stronger dance music â € ” but lately , they 've been slagging off that scene for its lack of imagination and its overreliance on preset sounds			1
of course , that only makes @entity22 , their first proper album in eight years , feel more like a revelation : it features no electronics except for a modular synthesizer and some vintage vocoders , and uses only one sample			1
( a snippet from the @entity31 ' '' @entity32 '' opens the final track , '' contact			0
'' ) recorded in the studio with an orchestra , a children 's choir , and an all - star cast that includes @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , and @entity43 , it 's a headphones album in an age of radio singles ; a bravura live performance that stands out against pro forma knob - twiddling ; a jazzy disco attack on the basic house beat ; a full collaboration at a time when the superstar @entity52 stands alone			1
it 's also quite moving ; melancholy runs through every song			2
as the title suggests , @entity22 explores the way that memory is stored â € ” on a hard drive or in your brain			1
nostalgia is a major theme here , both in the music , which celebrates disco ( first single '' @entity66 '' ) , funk ( '' @entity68 '' ) , and classic sci - fi soundtracks ( '' contact '' ) , and in the lyrics , which often feature men of a certain age reckoning with the past			2
'' @entity74 '' begins with the disco godfather recalling the days when he stayed out all night and slept in his car , while the music vividly evokes each decade he describes , building from a dramatic string section to record - scratching to a synth - pop finale that plays out like an epic laser - tag game			2
later , @entity80 wants to '' feel like i 'm 17 '' on the pedal - steel daydreamer '' fragment of @entity83 , '' and the wistful '' @entity84 '' finds @entity85 looking back on young love : '' i remember touch , '' he sighs through a vocoder , as spaceship sounds fire off			0
'' you 've given me too much to feel / you 've almost convinced me i 'm real			0
'' you do n't know whether you 're supposed to imagine him playing a sad @entity92 or a lonely astronaut			0
and maybe that 's the point : it 's hard to tell the difference between people and machines in dance music these days			0
but if @entity4 is turning humans into robots , @entity5 are working hard to make robot pop feel human again			0
grade - a best tracks : '' @entity74 '' a disco odyssey that explains the genre 's back story '' @entity84 '' a robot lament see the original story at @entity0			1
