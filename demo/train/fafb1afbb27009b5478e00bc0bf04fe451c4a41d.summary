@entity0 -- on friday , @entity3 chairman @entity2 said the @entity3 is prepared to vote on a nuclear arms treaty with @entity5			1
" we are certainly prepared to move for a vote , " he said on the @entity3 floor			1
" i want to emphasize that there are no amendments from colleagues on the @entity13 side			2
we are prepared to vote on this treaty ... we will take any amendment at any time			1
" sen. @entity16 , the ranking @entity17 on the committee , added that the @entity3 needs to get some sort of an amendment or " perhaps move to close off debate and have our last 30 hours			1
" under @entity3 rules , 30 hours of debate are needed before taking up a vote			1
all it takes , though , is one senator to use the full 30 hours			0
the treaty would resume mutual inspections of @entity29 and @entity5 nuclear arsenals while limiting both nations to 1,550 warheads and 700 launchers each			1
sen. @entity33 , @entity34 , said he believes they will get the 67 votes needed to pass the treaty ratification			0
senate majority leader @entity38 also weighed in , saying there is " nothing more important than the @entity42 treaty			0
" he is confident the @entity3 will move quickly through debating the treaty , but it all depends on his colleagues across the aisle			1
some @entity3 @entity17 have opposed bringing the measure up with so little time left in the lame - duck session			1
opening debate on the measure was stalled thursday night when the chamber moved on to other issues			2
@entity52 were trying to make progress on considering the treaty despite a @entity17 threat to block any legislation brought up before the @entity3 acts on a measure authorizing continued government spending			1
on wednesday , senators voted 66 - 32 to take up the treaty			0
the treaty cleared the @entity3 in september and has been endorsed by leading @entity17 figures , including former president @entity61 and @entity62			2
republicans had pledged to block consideration of any other legislative items until passage of both the spending measure and a tax package negotiated by the @entity68 and congressional @entity17			0
the current resolution authorizing government spending runs out saturday , requiring congressional approval of a new one to cover the rest of the fiscal year			0
sen. @entity75 , @entity76 , told reporters wednesday that a rushed schedule to debate the treaty would prevent @entity17 senators from being able to offer substantive amendments that require serious debate			2
he expressed " great frustration and disappointment " with what he called the refusal of @entity38 and @entity3 @entity52 to put off the debate until there is time to do it properly in the new @entity87 that convenes in early january			1
however , @entity52 said @entity75 and @entity17 have been given plenty of opportunities to discuss and influence the treaty , and now must show that they truly want it to go forward instead of continuing to delay it			0
ratification requires support from two - thirds of the @entity3 , or 67 votes			2
@entity52 currently control 58 seats and need nine republicans for ratification			0
in the new congressional session , the @entity52 will have only 53 seats and would need 14 @entity17 votes to ratify the treaty			0
@entity1 's @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 contributed to this report .			0

@entity3 chairman @entity2 says they are prepared to vote
he said there are no amendments being put forth and thus , it 's time to end debate
the accord resumes inspections of nuclear arsenals and reduced the numbers of warheads
