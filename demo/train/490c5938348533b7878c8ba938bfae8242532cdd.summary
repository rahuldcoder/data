-- call it the @entity2 2013			2
it 's a two - paragraph agreement , in both @entity4 and @entity5 , signed by climbers and @entity7 who on saturday engaged in a donnybrook at 23,000 feet			1
punches , kicks and even rocks were thrown , according to a statement posted sunday on the website of one of the climbers , @entity14			1
the @entity7 , locals who guide expeditions up the world 's highest mountain , apparently became angered when the climbers from @entity21 , @entity22 and the @entity23 did not listen to instructions from the @entity7 , moved above them on the peak and dislodged ice that fell in the direction of the @entity7			1
at one point " the climbers ... were told that if they were n't gone in one hour that they would all be killed , " the statement said			1
but by tuesday , both sides agreed to climb nice and put it in writing			2
" both parties have realized their errors and apologized to each other in front of those present , " says handwritten note obtained by @entity0 from the @entity35			2
" both parties agreed to help each other in the future to make successful each others goals			0
" the agreement bears at least 28 signatures , though some appear to have been repeated			2
no matter the exact number , their resolve against conflict seems certain			0
" all those present agreed and committed that such activities by anyone in the mountaineering and in the tourism sector , " it says			0
so maybe that will end what one post on @entity58 's website described as " an inauspicious start to the spring climbing season on @entity62			0
" in another post , a guide said mistakes were probably made on both sides			0
" @entity63 is a mountain where people pour an incredible amount of passion and money into their efforts			1
this is true for professional and recreational climbers , and for @entity7 who earn most or all of their family 's annual income in these two months on the mountain , " guide @entity81 wrote			1
" the constant pressure to break records , attempt new routes , and be the strongest , whether for personal pride , sponsors , future job offers , or media , can cloud the purity of our climbing here			0
and these pressures can lead to disagreements , arguments , and hurt feelings			0
but none of these pressures should be allowed to lead to violence , or to breaking the essential bonds that tie climbers to each other , " @entity81 added			2
but one of the climbers involved in the incident who signed the agreement told @entity23 's @entity109 newspaper that money has changed the @entity63 experience and spawned resentment among @entity7			1
" they 're angry at this financial gap on their mountain , " @entity113 said of the @entity7			1
" these commercial trips are based on a lot of luxury and getting you up the mountain and a lot of these @entity124 clients do n't even know what the names of their sherpas are			1
" and that , he says , makes him wonder if he 'll try @entity63 again , the @entity109 reported			0
" i did n't think the main danger would be a mob of sherpas throwing rocks , " @entity113 is quoted as saying			0
@entity0 's @entity135 and @entity136 contributed to this report .			0
