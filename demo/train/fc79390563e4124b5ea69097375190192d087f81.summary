after nearly a year of unprecedented attention given to allegations of widespread abuse and torture within @entity5 , one question is being repeatedly asked : when will the international community do anything about it ? on tuesday , a @entity9 committee is expected to consider a draft resolution on @entity5 's human rights abuses			1
the vote is merely a recommendation , as the @entity9 does not have the power to refer the regime or its young leader @entity16 to the @entity17 for crimes against humanity ( @entity17 )			1
that authority lies only with the @entity20 , a 15 - member body charged with maintaining global security			0
but the five permanent members at the core of the @entity20 , including @entity26 and @entity27 , wield veto powers			2
@entity26 is likely to use its veto as its officials have repeatedly called efforts to send @entity5 's leadership to the @entity17 as " not helpful			1
" here 's a reminder of where we are so far			0
what the draft resolution states the draft resolution , which was presented by the @entity38 and @entity39 , contains strong language against @entity5 and encourages others to push the country toward the @entity17 and issue " targeted sanctions			1
" this follows the recommendations from a scathing @entity20 @entity47 report on @entity5 published earlier this year			2
" we know the @entity20 and nations of the world are much more galvanized than they were last year , or any other point in history , to address @entity5 's systematic human rights abuses , " said @entity48 , a professor of @entity5 studies at @entity50			1
murder , torture , slavery , sexual violence , mass starvation -- @entity5 's leaders have been accused of employing all sorts of abuses to prop up the isolated regime and exercise total control over its citizens			2
@entity5 denies , denounces @entity5 has repeatedly denied the existence of human rights atrocities , denouncing the credibility of those who testified in the @entity47			1
it has repeatedly claimed that the @entity72 and its allies are seeking to discredit and overthrow the leadership in @entity5			0
does the @entity76 vote even matter ? since the power lies with the @entity20 -- and @entity26 is likely to veto any attempts to refer @entity5 to the international court -- what 's the significance of the vote ? " even from a strictly utilitarian viewpoint , a @entity20 vote would likely make a positive difference , " @entity48 said			1
" the international community would be better positioned to further build its case against the @entity5			0
" while @entity48 said that @entity5 's leadership is probably not rattled , it is " sensitive to the growing criticism			0
" and such " sustained pressure " is much more effective than " indifference or moral persuasion alone , " he said			0
the @entity26 veto throughout the year , @entity26 officials have reiterated that submitting human rights cases to the @entity17 " wo n't help improve a country 's human rights condition			1
" @entity5 's longtime ally has never wavered in its support for @entity101 -- even during bumps in their relationship			0
in may , @entity27 and @entity26 vetoed a @entity20 resolution that would have asked the @entity17 to investigate war crimes in @entity106			1
they were the only two of 15 countries to vote against the resolution			0
if @entity26 has to use its veto powers to defend @entity5 against the collective international will , there are effects , said @entity48			0
" high - profile actions at the @entity20 that pit @entity26 and the @entity5 on one side against the ' civilized ' nations of the world on the other have implications on how states and multinational corporations conduct trade and business with the @entity5 , " he said			1
" @entity124 was a powerful tool the world used against @entity128 's apartheid regime			0
likewise , deterring @entity130 states and companies from selling @entity5 luxury goods in violation of several @entity20 resolutions can only put pressure on the @entity16 regime			0
what the @entity72 wants the @entity72 backs the resolution to sanction and refer @entity5 to the @entity17			2
despite the gesture made by @entity5 last week to release the last remaining two @entity72 -- @entity140 and @entity141 -- detained in the country , it has not altered the @entity144 's stance on the country 's human rights			1
" nothing has changed about our concerns about @entity5 's human record -- abysmal human rights record , " said @entity147 , @entity148 spokeswoman			2
" those issues remain ones that we will continue to work with the international community on			0
