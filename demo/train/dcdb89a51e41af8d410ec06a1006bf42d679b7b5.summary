as a 36 - year cancer survivor , i am watching with great interest as the debate rages over whether the @entity4 strengthens the individual insurance market , as the law 's supporters contend , or dismantles it , as critics say			1
having been repeatedly denied health coverage i needed and wanted to buy because of my pre-existing condition , i know that provisions of the law can dramatically improve the quality and cost of insurance for people shopping for coverage on their own			1
i was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia as a college student			0
after nearly five years of aggressive chemotherapy , immunotherapy , bone marrow harvests and more , i was cancer - free			2
my cancer has never returned , but since then i have waged a battle of a different kind -- a three - decade struggle to obtain quality , affordable coverage			1
i spent a few years on my parents ' health plan as a student -- long before the new law guaranteed that parents ' policies can cover their children through age 26			1
later i joined my husband 's work - based plan			0
it was n't until he got laid off and our @entity41 coverage expired that i discovered how difficult it would be to buy a health plan on my own			1
i shopped around , but as soon as i revealed my pre-existing condition , i was denied coverage -- no further questions asked			1
my appeals were unsuccessful , and insurers would n't even sell me a plan at some sky - high price			0
i went to @entity53 's high - risk pool for uninsured people with pre-existing conditions , but the option to pay $ 1,800 a month for flimsy coverage that would have left my three young children uninsured was not really an option at all			1
after months of searching , i found an expensive plan with limited benefits through a professional association , and ever since i have paid to be a member of the organization just so i can maintain coverage			2
for 15 years my sons and i have struggled to afford the plan 's annual deductibles of up to $ 3,000 per person and monthly premiums that have risen about 30 % each year			2
every couple of years i reduced our coverage and gave up our trusted providers to avoid yet another premium increase , until we reached the plan 's minimum coverage level			1
now a single mom with three sons to put through college , i 've had to make some very tough choices			0
the situation is similar for the millions of uninsured people across the country who are living with cancer or another pre-existing condition			1
for decades , we have been denied coverage outright , charged exorbitantly expensive premiums for limited coverage and forced to pay tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars for lifesaving care			0
it 's no wonder that high medical bills are a major cause of family bankruptcies , or that seriously ill patients have died because they could not get the treatment that could have extended or even saved their life			0
the health care law offers people like me a choice of health plans sold in online marketplaces in every state			0
each plan must cover essential benefits needed to prevent and treat cancer or another serious disease , and no plan can turn down someone with a pre-existing condition or charge them more than they would a healthy person			1
no one will have coverage revoked if he or she gets sick or terminated if his or her plan 's coverage reaches an arbitrary limit			2
patients will not have to pay for preventive tests such as mammograms , and many people with low or moderate incomes could get tax credits that help them afford coverage			0
i visited @entity53 's marketplace , @entity131 , on october 1 -- the day it went live			0
at first i encountered technical problems , as so many others have , that were caused in part by the large number of people trying to find coverage			2
but i knew i had until december 15 to enroll for coverage to begin january 1			0
recently i tried again and enrolled in my chosen plan in about 15 minutes			0
in january , for the first time since my diagnosis 36 years ago , i will have an individual health plan that offers quality coverage for me and my family			1
i will save $ 628 every month on premiums			0
best of all -- i was n't even asked if i 've ever had cancer .			2
