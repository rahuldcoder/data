-- authorities have charged a man with being a stowaway after he allegedly took a flight from @entity5 to @entity6 , even though he did n't have a proper boarding pass and was not on the flight manifest			1
it was n't until after @entity10 took off from @entity11 on friday that the airline discovered the man , identified as @entity14 , was n't supposed to be on the flight , according to an @entity17 affidavit			1
