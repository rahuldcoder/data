the @entity0 said it wo n't challenge state laws that legalize marijuana and will focus federal enforcement on serious trafficking cases and keeping the drug away from children			1
attorney general @entity8 , in a conference call thursday morning , notified the governors of @entity10 and @entity11 that the department , for now , will not seek to pre-empt those states ' laws , which followed voters ' approval of ballot measures that legalized recreational marijuana use			1
@entity19 will remain illegal under the federal @entity20			0
but a department memo to federal prosecutors tightened federal marijuana prosecution standards			0
opinion : how to regulate pot when it 's legal under the new guidelines , federal prosecutors are required to focus on eight enforcement priorities , including preventing marijuana distribution to minors , preventing drugged driving , stopping drug trafficking by gangs and cartels and forbidding the cultivation of marijuana on public lands			2
the guidelines , issued by deputy attorney general @entity40 , have been months in the making and took on some urgency after citizens in @entity10 and @entity11 approved the ballot measures last fall			1
nineteen states and the @entity46 allow some legal use of marijuana , primarily for medicinal purposes			0
the attorney general told the @entity11 and @entity10 governors that the @entity0 will work with the states to craft regulations that fall in line with the federal priorities , and reserves the right to try to block the laws if federal authorities find repeated violations			1
are @entity61 opinions on marijuana changing ? the memo to prosecutors also seeks to address one common complaint from medicinal marijuana dispensaries in some states , which have been subject to raids by federal agents because they were deemed too big or profitable			2
the size and profitability of marijuana businesses will still be a factor prosecutors can consider , but there also must be additional illegal activities for prosecutors to take action			0
the new guidelines do n't change federal money laundering rules , meaning that some large banks may still be leery of doing business with marijuana producers and sellers			2
however , @entity0 officials said there is some leeway for banks to provide services to such businesses , so long as they do n't violate the eight priorities being assigned to federal prosecutors			0
" we received good news this morning when attorney general @entity8 told the governor the federal government would not pre-empt @entity11 and @entity10 as the states implement a highly regulated legalized market for marijuana , " @entity11 gov. @entity93 and attorney general @entity94 said in a statement			1
" we want to thank the attorney general for working with the states on this and for finding a way that allows our initiative to move forward while maintaining a commitment to fighting illegal drugs			0
this reflects a balanced approach by the federal government that respects the states ' interests in implementing these laws and recognizes the federal government 's role in fighting illegal drugs and criminal activity , " they said .			1
