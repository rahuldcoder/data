yes i am only a bill			2
and i 'm sitting here on @entity5			0
" " @entity6 , what 's your function			2
" " my hero , zero			0
" " @entity11 , @entity11 , @entity11 get your adverbs here			0
" these are some of the lyrics that live on 40 years after they premiered on saturday mornings on @entity16 as part of " @entity6			0
" they were animated videos and songs invented by a jazz musician who wanted to help children learn math. kids never really had any idea they were learning how a bill becomes a law or proper grammar while watching the three - minute shorts between cartoons			1
jazz pianist and vocalist @entity31 was approached in 1971 by a @entity34 advertising executive whose sons could not multiply			1
he asked him to set the multiplication tables to music			0
@entity31 ended up writing " @entity40 's a @entity39 " and other well known videos			1
he also voiced many of them			0
@entity31 , who is 89 and still performs , said he gets requests from adults to sing some of the bits because they grew up on them -- often times recognizing his voice			1
" i am not surprised at all ( that the videos still resonate ) , " @entity31 told @entity3			1
" i learned , when performing at elementary schools , that they were ' getting through , ' so to speak , and the children would readily recognize my voice on such vocals as ' @entity54 , ' and others that i sang			2
" however , what surprised me most was the impact of network television , which kicked in years later , after we 'd been on air at @entity61			2
thirteen years , plus a second round , helped us to reach literally thousands , in a rather broad age spectrum			0
" " @entity6 " premiered on jan. 13 , 1973 , and ran on @entity16 from 1973 - 1985			2
it came back in the 1990s for five more years			0
more than 30 million people have now watched some of them on @entity68 , showing that @entity31 's work still resonates			1
it is not just the catchy words that connected with kids			1
they were combined with interesting visuals			0
one spot featured a talking " bill " that explained to a boy how he could only become a law by passing both houses of @entity80 and then going to the @entity81 hoping the president would sign him			1
" @entity6 " used train cars named " and , " " but " and " or " that illustrated how a conjunction connected words			0
asked why the videos connected , @entity31 said , " the melodies , words , arrangements , and players			1
that is to say , even though they were in a ' rock ' or ' pop ' bag , my jazz sensibilities and the fine musicians i used for the audio recordings made the songs seem unusual to the saturday morning cartoon listeners			2
" just last week , there was a vivid example of just how popular the videos remain			1
more than a thousand people -- adults who wanted to relive part of their childhood and parents who wanted to share the fun with their kids -- jammed into the lobby of the @entity114 to hear @entity31 sing " three 's a @entity39 " and " @entity116 is @entity117			1
" " i came because i had such fond , intense memories , " said @entity118 , who brought her 9 - year - old daughter , @entity119			0
" i could sing all of it without the words			0
