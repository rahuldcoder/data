@entity0 , @entity1 -- many in the @entity4 would like to see @entity1 punished for its nuclear ambitions			1
@entity0 's residents would like those people to take a glimpse into their lives			1
the @entity10 announced monday it is banning the import of @entity1 crude oil and blocking trade in gold , diamonds , and precious metals , among other steps , adding to sanctions already imposed by the @entity19 and the @entity20			1
the measures take a big toll on @entity1 's lifeblood oil revenues			1
the lives of ordinary @entity1 have been deeply touched in recent weeks by the @entity26 sanctions			1
several spoke to @entity2 about how they are coping with staggering inflation and a plunging national currency , although none felt comfortable being fully identified , fearful of the @entity32 's long reach into private lives			1
@entity34 , 47 , was once comfortable , but things began sliding downhill when sanctions came and the foreign oil firm that employed him packed up and left			1
as a taxi driver , he works hard but saves little money			2
with the latest round of @entity19 sanctions imposed on @entity1 's @entity43 last month , he has seen staggering inflation ; the price of meat and milk have skyrocketed by as much as 50 percent			1
he and his wife have stopped having guests at their home or going out to eat			1
they ca n't remember when they bought new clothes and no longer send their suits to the cleaners			2
" i feel bad for the cleaners , " he says			2
" they must be suffering as a result of people like me not using their services			2
" @entity34 has a savings account that is shrinking fast as he dips into it to make ends meet			2
his 21 - year - old son works two part - time jobs while he earns a degree in computer science			2
@entity34 feels bad that he ca n't afford to buy him the computer equipment he needs			1
" i wait and pray for something to spark the economy and get it going , but i am not holding my breath , " he says			0
" life must go on			0
we can only wait and see what the future has in store for us			0
" in the meantime , he says , the only way for his sons to live a decent life is to fall in with influential people or make shady business deals like trading foreign currency on the black market			0
the @entity19 and other @entity26 powers argue sanctions that target @entity1 's central bank , oil exports and foreign trade are designed to push @entity1 to cooperate at the nuclear negotiating table			1
they believe the @entity32 is developing nuclear weapons , although @entity0 insists its program is reserved strictly for civilian energy purposes			1
prospects for talks have been dimmed by recent bellicose talk and actions aimed at destabilizing the @entity0 government			1
it 's doubtful , most analysts say , that punitive measures will bring @entity1 to its knees			1
doubtful , too , is that @entity0 residents will suffer the same fate as their @entity110 counterparts , who for years , under international sanctions against @entity113 's regime , faced dire shortages of basic goods			1
but as @entity1 - @entity19 scholar @entity117 put it , the latest sanctions have been back - breaking , not just for the less affluent but also for the middle class			1
" people are buying less because the prices have gone up , " she said			1
" that affects the shopkeepers			0
it 's a vicious cycle			1
" for many people , monthly government subsidies of $ 40 or $ 50 are no longer enough to get by , @entity117 said			0
president @entity127 told parliament recently that the most recent sanctions -- imposed after an @entity131 report that said @entity0 appeared to have worked on developing a nuclear bomb -- were " the most extensive ... sanctions ever			1
" @entity127 called the sanctions " the heaviest economic onslaught on a nation in history ... every day , all our banking and trade activities and our agreements are being monitored and blocked			1
" with the punitive measures came the downward spiral of the @entity1 currency , the rial , severely devalued in the past few months against the @entity19 dollar			1
that plunge , said @entity2 's @entity147 , is a key indication of @entity1 's instability			1
" when @entity153 became president , you could buy 9,700 rials with one dollar , " he wrote in a column			1
" since then , the dollar has appreciated 60 percent against the rial , meaning you can buy 15,600 rials			1
@entity0 's reaction to the prospect of sanctions that affect its oil exports shows its desperation			1
" the higher dollar , of course , has made imported goods unaffordable for most @entity1			1
@entity34 says he eyed a refrigerator several months ago			0
it was made in @entity1 and affordable			1
but when he returned to buy it , the price had gone up 20 percent			2
the salesman informed him that parts of the fridge were made in @entity172			0
the soaring prices and declining currency values come at a time when @entity1 is already facing " huge challenges " created partly by government mismanagement and failures in foreign policy , said one economist in @entity1			1
" i think the situation will be aggravated in the coming months , " he told @entity2			0
" we will witness higher inflation and unemployment rates with less economic growth			0
" those who study the impact of sanctions argue that they must hurt in order to be effective , but not to the point where they break the economy , like they did in @entity195			2
that does not bode well for @entity1 trying to make ends meet			1
@entity198 , 59 , fancies himself a retired tea man			0
that is , financial losses forced the office where he worked to close three years ago			0
he now does odd jobs			0
he manages to make about $ 200 a month and receives another $ 135 from the government			0
the youngest of his three daughters is not married yet and still lives with her parents			0
he says the family gave up eating fruit -- it 's too pricey and now is just a treat when guests come over			2
red meat went up from about $ 6 a kilogram to $ 9			0
dinner at his house means vegetarian rice and beans			0
" when i ask the shopkeepers why the prices keep going up , ( they ) say the government sets the prices and they have to do as they are told , " he says			2
" people are hungry and this is why crime has gone up			0
" he says his son - in - law 's motorcycle was stolen in front of his house			2
theft was not something he worried about before			0
it 's not just the price of food and consumer goods that are hurting @entity1			1
services like electricity and water are costing more , too			0
@entity198 's monthly utility bill has almost doubled to $ 19 a month			2
add it all up , he says , and it 's tough to make it on his income			2
his wife tells him to stop worrying or he 'll have a heart attack			0
" i guess if we get really stuck for our daily expenses , i would have to move to a cheaper apartment or , in the worst case scenario , there will be no choice but to go to the north and live with my wife 's parents			2
at least i wo n't have to worry about the rent there , " he says			0
@entity260 , president of the @entity261 , says sanctions are putting far more pressure on @entity1 's citizenry than on the regime they are intend to punish			1
" the government always has the ability to circumvent sanctions and shift the burden onto the population , " @entity260 says			2
@entity272 , 39 , says he and his wife both have college degrees , but he earns money doing chores at an office -- making lunch , running errands , even cleaning			0
he worries for @entity279 , his 5 - year - old daughter			0
perhaps a day will come when he has to move to a less expensive city in order to pay for her education			0
" i see no chance for me to ever find a job where i can use my university degree , " he says			0
" i am almost 40 now and as time goes by and i get older , no one will hire me			0
as it is , i am always worried that i may lose my job			0
" some @entity0 residents are stocking up on things while they can afford it , and while they are still on the shelves			1
@entity296 , a retired nurse who survives solely on her government pension , bought a supply of grains and canned foods , just in case			0
she also feels lucky to own her apartment , so she does n't have to worry about making rent			0
she says a friend recently was hospitalized for two weeks			0
it cost her more than $ 11,000			0
" of course you can not blame the doctors and hospitals because they have to pay for high - priced foods , materials and equipment , " the nurse says			0
high prices of food affect everything			2
" analysts say the government ought to be fearful of too much discontent			0
unemployment and stagflation helped fuel the 2009 mass demonstrations that at times appeared on the brink of bringing change to @entity1 's authoritarian rule			1
@entity34 says he understands he is caught up in global politics			0
" i do n't know what must be done to correct the economic condition , but i do n't blame the @entity19 and their sanctions , " he says			2
@entity331 has to watch out for its own interests			0
and @entity1 , he says , must do what it can to safeguard its own			1
