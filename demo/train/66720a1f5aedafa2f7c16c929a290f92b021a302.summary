@entity0 was feeling overwhelmed by the unworn clothes languishing in his closet when he began poking around @entity4 's menswear forums , where style - conscious men debate different shoe leather and denim brands , or bravely seek constructive feedback on how a suit fits			1
@entity0 , a @entity10 pilot , got into discussions about what to wear if you could only choose one outfit for the rest of your life , a popular topic on such forums			1
it was hypothetical at first , but as the list grew , @entity0 decided he had enough intel to turn into a real - life experiment			1
" i 'd been trimming it down over the past year , but after that conversation on the @entity27 , it really struck me that i do n't need all this stuff , " he said			1
as of june 1 , @entity0 has pledged to pare down his wardrobe to 10 articles of clothing for the next year , excluding socks , underwear and outerwear			1
the list includes : one pair of pants , one pair of shorts , two t - shirts , one button - down , one sweatshirt , one pair of sneakers , one pair of boots , a blazer and a belt			0
he declared his intention in may to wear one outfit for one year in a blog post titled " minimalism			1
" the timing could n't be better , he said			1
he and his wife were moving to a smaller home , and he would be on parental leave from the @entity10 for six months , freeing him from the daily obligation to wear a flight suit			1
it was also a way for him to start experimenting with how to live with less overall , he said			1
" we 've found over the past year that having less stuff can actually allow you more freedom			1
instead of spending free time sorting stuff , or organizing stuff , or searching through stuff for other stuff , you can hopefully spend more time doing things that you want to be doing , " he wrote			0
most of us aspire to de-clutter our lives at some point			2
shunning all material possessions is a big leap for most , but slimming down one 's closet is an easier first step			1
popular minimalist fashion movements include the 10 - piece capsule , the five - piece @entity81 wardrobe and @entity82 , which invites participants to dress with 33 items or less for three months			2
when people recognize the benefits of fewer choices in their closets , they start thinking about how to apply the philosophy to other areas of their lives , said @entity94 , creator of @entity82			1
" it 's sort of the gateway drug for further simplicity , because that 's where we start each day , " @entity94 said			1
@entity94 began @entity82 in 2010 to simplify her life while dealing with the onset of multiple sclerosis , and ended up inspiring a movement that continues to gain momentum			0
@entity82 's @entity107 page , which has more than 12,000 likes , features stories from people around the world participating in the challenge			0
inspired by @entity82 , @entity114 reporter @entity113 started her own version earlier this month , the @entity116 , and invited readers to join her			0
so far , 30 have signed up from around the world " the simplicity of a minimalist wardrobe really appealed to me			2
i wanted to give it a try and see how it would affect my perspective on things like style , spending habits , materialism and contentment			0
i have two little kids -- ages 2.5 and 9 months -- so i do n't really have time in the morning for trying on outfits and staring into my closet , " @entity131 said			1
" i tend to have a hard time getting rid of clothes even if i never wear them , because of guilt that i spent money on them or because i 'm afraid i might want or need them at some point			1
i want to prove that i can let go of those clothes and be perfectly fine			0
" so far , it 's working out , she said			0
she saves time in the morning and laundry is easier			0
when temperature fluctuations struck , she layered tops to stay warm			0
" it 's nice only wearing my favorite clothes and jewelry , and not feeling guilty for neglecting other clothes i may not like as much , " she said			0
" i feel a sense of calm when i look in my closet			2
it 's stressful when there are clothes jammed into every available space , especially when you have a toddler who might come in and start tearing clothes off the hangers when you 're trying to get ready			2
now there is breathing room in my closet and it makes me feel like i 'm starting the day with some semblance of organization and control			2
" cutting back completely changed @entity94 's life			0
after being separated from her clothing those first three months , she realized most of it did n't matter to her			1
today , she continues to use only 33 clothing items ( not including underwear , sleepwear or workout clothing ) at a time , reassessing her wardrobe every three months to cycle in seasonal necessities from a single container into her closet			1
she still makes purchases to replace items in her closet , but she 's more thoughtful about them , she said			2
the minimalist philosophy has extended to other areas of her life			0
after deciding that she could do with much less in the kitchen , the living room and elsewhere in her home , she moved from her 2,000 square - foot home into an apartment			0
she also left her job in advertising to focus full - time on consulting with others to streamline their lives and businesses			2
parting with clothing , even clothing you hate , is hard , said @entity200 , managing editor of @entity201 , an online publication geared toward women 's interests			2
start by asking : does it fit ? does it look good on me ? when was the last time i wore it ? if you ca n't answer " yes , " " yes , " and " within the last year , " the item has to go , she said			1
if you really want to rock a minimalist closet , it helps to invest in quality pieces that do double , triple or quadruple duty , @entity214 said			2
think a crisp white blouse , a black blazer and a perfectly fitting pair of jeans accompanied by shoes and accessories to bring in more color and current trends			0
but the first step is overcoming the fear that " it could never work for me " and starting small			1
do n't get rid of anything at first , project 333 's @entity94 recommends			1
hold onto everything and gradually shed the items you did n't realize you were missing during the experiment			2
everyone has different reasons for paring down their wardrobe			0
for some , like @entity94 , the goal was to reduce stress and clutter			0
for others , it 's part of an effort to focus on quality over quantity			0
consumers are demanding a return to high - quality items that can stand the test of time , @entity214 said " we 're in an era of examining our carbon footprint			0
nobody wants a closet that looks like a landfill , " she said			2
@entity0 's motivation falls into this camp			1
" i tried to find brands that embody this whole idea of making high quality products out of the best materials available , " he said			0
and , it shows in the bill : $ 2,703 , as one @entity265 estimated the total cost of @entity0 's 10 pieces , most of which are made in @entity270			1
each piece of clothing was selected for its versatility and durability in different weather conditions and social environments , @entity0 said			1
he avoided denim because it was too " casual " but he did n't want to wear a suit all year , leading to a wardrobe consisting of mostly synthetic fabrics that keep you cool in the summer and warm in the winter			1
it helps that some clothing brands heard about his plans and donated clothing to his experiment			2
still , he says , he chose clothing by brands that he already owned or was likely to own , making the experiment not too far removed from reality			0
" the way i justify buying higher quality items is in buying less and buying the best i can afford , " he said			0
" my closet is full of cheap clothes that will never wear out because i never wear them			1
the items that i saved for and sought after , however , get plenty of loving wear			0
" his exercise is n't meant to be prescriptive for everyone , he said			0
" this was just a fun experiment for me to see how long things last , " he said			0
" who knows , maybe it 'll inspire others to think about how minimalism could work in their closet			0
