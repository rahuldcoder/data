-- as a frequent traveler to @entity3 , i ca n't help but compare it to the @entity5			1
at first , i admired its new architecture			0
then i became fascinated with how many different recycling bins line the streets			0
lately , i 've been marveling at the country 's work - life balance			1
@entity3 work on average 35 hours per week by law			1
yet , @entity3 has n't lost any edge as an industrial powerhouse			2
in fact , @entity3 has remained @entity17 's biggest economy , even helping to keep the continent afloat during the global recession			2
( though lately , growth has been modest for @entity3 as anxiety looms over @entity17 ' drag economy			2
) and let 's not forget the amazingly generous maternity - leave policies			2
when @entity3 babies are born , parents can take up to 14 months off of work while still making 65 % of their salary			1
concern for work - life balance does n't stop there			1
@entity3 labor minister @entity32 is calling for an " anti-stress regulation " forbidding employers from contacting their employees after business hours			1
talk about protecting people 's personal time			0
there 's good reason to be concerned about work - life balance			1
one - third of all heart disease cases are linked to stress , often from working too hard			0
a 2012 study showed that working lengthy hours increases current and future risks of depression			0
as @entity52 reported this week , a health expert from the @entity51 has sounded an alarm about the stress , burnout and reduced productivity that result from working too much			0
whether or not the policy is enacted , one thing is clear : @entity5 could learn a thing or two from @entity3 when it comes to healthy work attitudes			1
imagine the outcry if an @entity5 politician or high - ranking government official suggested a " no emails after 6 p.m. " policy			2
the reactions ? probably : " she 's a lazy bum ! " " he wants a nanny state ! " " the government wants to take away my right to work all the time and neglect my family ! " i happen to have a job that i love , and i do n't mind answering emails at all hours			2
but not everyone is so fortunate			0
for fear of losing their jobs , many @entity5 not only check emails after hours but also go to work while sick			2
who cares if you 're giving everyone strep throat ? at least the boss knows you 're a hard worker			0
and then there are the people who can make ends meet just fine , but still feel the need to be workaholics			0
does our protestant work ethic condition us to classify leisure time as a moral failure ? are we in some sort of sick competition to see who can be the most over-worked , over-stressed person ? compared with other rich countries , @entity5 is more stressed and less happy			1
according to the @entity100 , we are 28th among advanced nations when it comes to work - life balance -- ninth from the bottom			1
if increasing our work hours hurts us instead of helping us , why exactly do we do it ? what 's fascinating about this topic is that @entity5 conservatives love to extol @entity5 's " family values " while demonizing those godless @entity17 countries like @entity3			1
yet @entity5 has no mandatory maternity leave , no limits to the work week and certainly no interest in curtailing the ability to be " on call " 24 hours a day			2
is n't it pro-family to be able to have the time to care for a newborn ? is n't it pro-family to be able to spend time , uninterrupted , with your loved ones in the evening ? journalist @entity127 argued in @entity128 earlier this year that if @entity5 social conservatives really wanted a return to households where men were the breadwinners , women stayed home with the kids and people had more time for family overall , they should embrace @entity17 - style socialism			1
but as the " no email after work " proposal demonstrates , some @entity3 fear they 're getting too close to attaining that great @entity5 value called stress			1
in the @entity5 , one in nine employees work more than 50 hours a week			1
in @entity3 , it 's one in 18			2
that 's a big difference			0
but get this -- in the @entity150 , only one in 152 employees works more than 50 hours per week , making @entity3 look quite " @entity5 " in comparison			1
whether @entity3 restricts emails after hours is n't the point			0
the point is protecting your work - life balance			1
@entity3 knows how to do it , and we do n't			0
granted , some jobs , such as doctors , paramedics and firefighters , require some level of being on call			0
other jobs -- which is to say , the majority of jobs -- have no such need			0
nevertheless , we @entity5 always have our laptops open , our smartphones on and our tablets handy			0
better be ready in case the boss needs us during dinner , family time or vacation			0
but this attitude will be worth it in the end , right ? at least on our deathbeds we 'll never have to say , " i wish i 'd made myself more available by email after work			0

in @entity3 a proposed law would ban employers from emailing employees after work
@entity193 : @entity3 is far ahead of @entity5 in work - life balance policies and *culture*
he says conservatives like to extol " family values " yet @entity5 has few family - *friendly* polices
@entity193 : no wonder when compared with other rich countries , @entity5 is more stressed
