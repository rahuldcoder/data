last june , an @entity26 court sentenced @entity0 and his colleagues @entity27 and @entity29 to seven years in prison on charges of disseminating false news and supporting a terrorist organization			1
the three men have steadfastly denied the charges and the @entity37 - owned @entity10 network has said " they were just doing their job covering and challenging all sides of the story in @entity26			1
