-- how do two convicted murderers walk out of prison ? too easily , it appears			1
@entity4 and @entity5 were free for some time , though this fact did n't become public knowledge until this week			1
as @entity10 authorities looked for the two men , they also insisted they are n't to blame -- even if others dropped the ball or were fooled in a big , big way			1
" we 've had a system failure that resulted in two individuals being erroneously released , " @entity16 , @entity10 , sheriff @entity15 said			1
" ... this is very frustrating for all of us who work in the system			1
" the sheriff said friday evening the two were thought to be in the @entity27 area			2
in fact , they ended up getting caught saturday evening about 360 miles to the northwest at a @entity32 motel , the @entity28 announced			1
the two fugitives , both 34 , had n't needed a @entity35 - style jailbreak or even a " @entity38 " card to spring themselves out of the @entity37			2
instead they used forged documents indicating their life sentences had been modified and they could leave			1
the legal - looking documents contained bogus reproductions of several key players ' signatures , including those of the @entity27 - area state attorney or the assistant state attorney and judge @entity48			1
they bore the seal of the @entity16 clerk of court 's office			0
the documents were processed by the state @entity54 and the men were released			1
processing the paper work is more akin to data entry than high - level analysis or approval , noted veteran @entity10 criminal defense attorney @entity61			1
" however it was done , it was well - planned and they know the system well enough to place it , " said @entity61 , a @entity0 legal analyst known for representing @entity62			2
as well as those behind the convicts ' release might have executed their scheme , some think others in authority could have done better , but the agencies involved are defending their actions			2
the orders to release @entity4 and @entity5 looked legitimate , said @entity77 state attorney @entity76			1
the county clerk of court 's office did n't do anything wrong , spokeswoman @entity78 said			0
it acts " like a post office , " @entity84 said , " our role is to take orders and send them to the appropriate agency			2
" that last agency , the @entity90 , is throwing up its hands as well			2
the court passed along documentation indicating the two murderers ' sentences had been changed , and " it 's not our job to question what the court does , " said @entity54 spokeswoman @entity99			2
" the fault does not lie on us			0
no one is getting in trouble here for what happened , " she said			0
whoever is to blame , the price is being paid			0
law enforcement officials worked overtime to try to find @entity4 and @entity5 , with a reward of $ 10,000 apiece being offered for information leading to their capture			1
the relatives of the men 's victims were angry , scared and wanted an explanation			0
and while @entity15 said friday he did n't know of any similar premature releases of inmates , @entity61 said that given how smoothly this plan worked , how readily available court documents are in @entity10 , and how seemingly simple it was to pull off , it would be naive to think this has n't happened before , freeing other convicts well before their time was served			1
" i doubt it happens very much , because this is very unusual , " said @entity61			0
" but this could have gone for 10 years or more			0
" sentenced to life without parole , then set free in september 1998 , @entity130 killed @entity131 during a home - invasion robbery attempt			2
six months later , @entity133 was gunned down on an @entity27 street corner -- shot dead , a jury determined , by @entity136			0
both killers were convicted and sentenced to life behind bars without the possibility of parole within two years of their crime			0
while it 's not known if they knew each other , they were at the same prison in @entity147 , in @entity10 's @entity148			1
@entity5 left there on september 27 , and @entity4 left on october 8 , according to authorities			1
they had motions indicating the sentences had been reduced , as well as court orders granting the request			0
investigators later discovered these documents were forged			1
asked how someone might replicate the documents , @entity61 noted that court filings in @entity10 cases are available online , so they might be mimicked by " anybody with a little common sense , " access to a word processing tool and the gall to replicate signatures seen on those records			1
there might have been a screw - up , but @entity172 said there is no " cover - up " at the @entity54			0
that agency 's chief , @entity175 , has promised a " vigorous and thorough review " to make sure others were n't also wrongly freed			2
" this will be a lesson learned for all involved			0
we may now look more closely at what the court sends , " @entity172 said			0
" our system is being accused , and people are being led to believe that the @entity185 let these guys walk out the front door , and that 's just not the case			2
" there 's good reason to question , and change , the system , @entity61 said			2
whereas victims are notified before a defendant 's pretrial release , there 's no such notice -- even to prosecutors -- before a convict walks free , he pointed out			1
in fact , the first that prosecutors got wind of what happened was after they were contacted by a member of @entity4 's family , @entity76 said			1
an october 8 letter from the @entity54 to @entity133 's mother , @entity206 , notified her a " court order and amended sentence caused ( @entity4 's ) sentence to expire			1
" " please be aware that recent actions causing the release of this offender are beyond our control			2
nevertheless , we apologize for the delay in this message , " it said			0
it does n't have to be this way , @entity61 said			0
" let not only the victim 's family know well ahead of time , then send it to the state 's attorney , " he said , surmising prosecutors as well as victims wo n't let mistakes by so easily			0
" ... that 's an easy fix			0
" not the first case , perhaps not the last one irony is that @entity10 authorities were completely ignorant that such ruses can work			1
on october 7 , charging documents were filed against another inmate , @entity234 , for allegedly trying a similar scheme in 2011			0
@entity234 is accused of forgery and attempted escape after a police detective who initially helped convict the man discovered he was scheduled to be released despite being sentenced to life in prison for the attempted first - degree murder of a law enforcement officer , according to @entity76 's statement			1
the investigation revealed that someone had forged @entity76 's name on a bogus court order reducing the sentence and a circuit court judge 's name on the order reducing @entity255 ' life sentence , the statement said			0
nonetheless , @entity4 was freed thanks to his own forged documents the very next day -- october 8			1
both he and @entity5 appeared to play by the rules afterward			1
they both went to the @entity16 jail to register as felons -- jenkins on september 30 , @entity4 on october 11 -- an audacious " and really smart move " by both men , because it bought them time before authorities were tipped off anything was awry , @entity61 said			1
while their releases may have initially seemed legitimate and innocuous , the two convicts had been classified as escapees by this week			0
one of the officials whose signature was forged said he would n't be surprised if something like this happens again			0
it may not work exactly the same way , but it would be unwise to assume criminals wo n't try whatever they can to get out of prison , said judge @entity48			0
" people , particularly people with criminal minds , come up with ingenious ways to beat the system , " @entity48 said			0
" they have nothing but time on their hands to think of things			0
" @entity0 's @entity288 , @entity289 , @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity292 and @entity293 contributed to this report .			0
