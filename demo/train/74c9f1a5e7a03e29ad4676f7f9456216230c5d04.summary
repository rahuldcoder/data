@entity0 , @entity1 -- inside a half - empty lecture hall at the @entity5 , @entity3 explains her cause			1
" the thing about @entity9 is that nobody really knows what 's going on there because there 's not much media coverage , " @entity3 said during a recent visit			1
" but the protests never stopped			0
" at just 26 , the young woman is already one of her country 's most outspoken rights activists , and she 's on a mission : to make sure " that people across the world , not just the @entity23 world , across the world , are hearing about what 's going on the ground			1
" to carry out that mission , @entity3 -- who has dual @entity9 and @entity30 citizenship , and is the acting president of the @entity32 -- lives in exile and travels the world explaining how her people are oppressed			1
back in the auditorium , her audience is small , but extremely attentive			0
" every single day , " @entity3 says , " between 15 to 25 different areas come out to protest in @entity9			1
" those demonstrations began in february 2011 , at the height of the @entity41			0
@entity9 citizens , spurred by successful uprisings in @entity44 and @entity45 , demanded democratic reforms and other changes in the way the country was run			1
anger from the majority @entity52 population was directed at the ruling @entity55 minority			0
but @entity9 's uprising failed to gain the traction of other regional revolutions after a crackdown by authorities in the tiny island state , backed by troops from nearby @entity63 and the @entity64			1
demonstrators say authorities killed dozens of people and arrested , tortured and imprisoned hundreds of others			0
opposition leaders have tried to keep the protest movement alive			0
for @entity3 , the cause continues			1
she says her countrymen and women will not be silenced , despite the odds they face			0
" when you 're talking about human rights , it 's black and white , " she says			0
" there 's no excuse for committing human rights violations			0
" @entity3 accuses @entity9 's government of committing violations on a daily basis , and says her organization exists in part to document those abuses			1
the government denies the claims , saying it has implemented tough penalties for those who incite what it calls " terrorism			2
" in a statement , the @entity9 government says it has implemented reforms and set up independent bodies to address grievances			1
" we would also like to make it very clear that ms. @entity102 's personal misguided view that ' @entity9 citizens are oppressed ' is not representative of the broad consensus , nor of the opposition front , " the statement said			1
the government also acknowledged the country 's " challenging past " and said remedies are under way			2
" since the release of the @entity115 ( @entity115 ) report in 2011 , @entity9 has made a commitment to address all grievances , as well as well reform the institutional landscape to ensure historical errors are not repeated			1
in regards to grievances pertaining to any accusation of mistreatment , independent bodies have been established to investigate and address any incident of misconduct that may undermine public confidence in the @entity129 ( @entity130 ) , even if no formal complaint is filed			2
" read full government statement this kind of sparring is nothing new to @entity3 , who was literally born into this line of work			1
she comes from a well - known family of dissidents			2
her father , @entity140 , was sentenced to life in prison for his role in anti-government demonstrations and plotting to overthrow the country 's royal family			2
many rights groups have called him a prisoner of conscience			0
her sister , @entity150 , is also a very prominent rights activist , and also currently locked up -- having been sentenced to prison for , among other things , insulting the police			0
it can all get to be too much , which is why @entity3 says she has to detach			1
" part of doing this work is teaching yourself to depersonalize all of the cases that you deal with , " she explains			0
" when i talk about @entity140 the political prisoner and the torture victim , or the torture survivor , i do n't talk about @entity140 , my father , who i shared my childhood with -- i talk about @entity140 , the person who is known to @entity9 and is known to the cause			1
" " when i talk about @entity150 , you know , being separated from her three - year - old child , i 'm not talking about my sister and my niece , " adds @entity3			2
" i 'm talking about @entity150 the @entity9 citizen			2
" over the past two years , @entity3 has become somewhat of a celebrity in the world of human rights activism , and not just in @entity9			1
regularly invited to conferences around the world , she finds her platform growing every day -- with more than 94,000 @entity178 followers			0
she was even named one of @entity181 's @entity180 in 2012			0
she seems happy to address anyone willing to listen			0
still , she says , it 's never easy			0
" the thing with being a human rights defender is that it 's always accompanied with guilt because no matter what you do , you feel you 're not doing enough			0
" which is why @entity3 is always connected -- either online or on her phone , no matter where she goes -- reviewing claims , making cases , tweeting updates			2
she was in @entity1 for only a few days , but never stopped addressing audiences both digital and physical , large and small , urging the world to listen to the stories of the oppressed , one voice at a time .			2

@entity3 was born into a family of activists
she travels the world to tell stories of @entity9 oppression
the @entity9 government says it addresses grievances , investigates abuse
