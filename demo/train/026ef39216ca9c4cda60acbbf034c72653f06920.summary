-- in a world of mass - marketed gadgets designed to be trashed and replaced after a few years , is there room for the @entity5 , a machine that lets you design and draw images on ... you guessed it ... eggs ? or how about the @entity11 , a hand - crafted cover for the @entity13 and other tablets that can be personalized to look like your favorite book ? @entity17 thinks so			1
that 's why he started @entity19			1
located in @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity19 aims to develop and design tools that help " makers " around the world build items that more mainstream manufacturers ca n't ... or wo n't			1
from designing actual tools to researching the best ways to create small manufacturing businesses in urban areas , the @entity19 is designed to spur a movement that , in itself , was spurred by modern business practices			1
@entity17 says that , even with history 's largest range of mass - produced products available on the market , they 're just that -- mass produced			1
consumers , he says , actually have a harder time finding products that suit their personal wants and needs			2
" inspired in part by @entity48 " make " magazine and the book , " makers , " that spun off from it , " makers , " @entity17 says , are an emerging subculture of designers and engineers inspired to create with individual interests , not mass - market appeal , in mind			1
" in the @entity60 and @entity61 , people are starting to realize that there 's this opportunity to make again , " @entity17 said			2
" i think in the rest of the world , they 're kind of like ' well , is n't it funny you all call this ' making			2
' we 've been doing this forever			0
that 's one of the things that 's exciting to me is the meeting of those two places			0
" at last @entity78 's @entity77 conference in @entity79 , @entity80 , he talked up some of the products that have been created with the help of @entity19 , and other creations from the " maker movement " including the aforementioned @entity5			1
" they sell , actually , quite a lot of them , " he said			0
" imagine trying to buy one of these at @entity89			0
probably not going to happen			0
" or the @entity11 , which he says single - handedly saved a 50 - year - old book - binding company in @entity94 and allowed them to add 10 new jobs during the height of the recession			2
the maker movement he aims to support , @entity17 says , is n't just about making new products available			1
in many cases , he says , it 's the creator , not the consumer , who gets the most satisfaction			0
" i think that 's the fundamental thing behind the wonder in the maker movement , " he said			0
" this idea that , ' wow ... the difference between nothing and something was me			0
' " @entity0 's @entity111 and @entity112 contributed to this report .			0

@entity20 factory aims to help do - it - yourself " makers " create goods
