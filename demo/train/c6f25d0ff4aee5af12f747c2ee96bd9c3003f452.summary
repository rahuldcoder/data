in february , @entity0 published a lengthy profile of " @entity2			1
" the story did not identify the killer by his real name , referring to him only as " the shooter			0
" the shooter told @entity0 he encountered @entity9 's leader face - to - face in the top - floor bedroom of the compound in @entity13 , @entity14 , where he 'd been hiding for more than five years			1
@entity7 said the @entity9 leader was standing up and had a gun " within reach " and it was only then that the shooter fired two shots into @entity22 's forehead , killing him			1
that account was in conflict with the narrative from another raid participant in a wildly successful book , " @entity28			0
" now , another member of the secretive @entity30 , which executed the @entity22 raid , tells @entity32 the story of the shooter as presented in @entity0 is false			1
according to this serving @entity30 operator , the story is " complete @entity37 " watch more : @entity38 examines the differing accounts on " the lead with @entity41 " @entity43 6 operators are now in " serious lockdown " when it comes to " talking to anybody " about the @entity22 raid and say they have been frustrated to see what they consider to be the inaccurate story in @entity0 receive considerable play without a response			1
@entity52 , who wrote the 15,000 - word piece about the shooter for @entity0 , was booked on @entity32 , @entity55 and many other tv networks after his story came out			1
twenty - three seals and their interpreter launched the assault on the bin laden compound just after midnight on the morning of may 2 , 2011			0
they shot and killed @entity22 's two bodyguards , one of @entity22 's sons and the wife of one of the bodyguards , and wounded two other women			0
the first three seals to make it to the top floor of the compound were " the point man , " " the shooter " profiled by @entity0 , and @entity74 , the seal who wrote " @entity28 " under the pseudonym @entity78			1
what actually happened the night of the raid , according to the @entity30 operator who i interviewed , is that the " point man " ran up the stairs to the top floor and shot @entity22 in the head when he saw what looked like @entity22 poking his head out of his bedroom door			2
the shot gravely wounded @entity9 's leader			0
having taken down @entity22 , the point man proceeded to rush two women he found in the bedroom , gathering them in his arms to absorb the explosion in case they were wearing suicide vests , something that was a real concern of those who planned the raid			2
' nightmare ' at home for seal who shot @entity22 two more seals then entered @entity22 's bedroom and , seeing that the @entity9 leader was lying mortally wounded on the floor , finished him off with shots to the chest			0
this account of @entity22 's demise is considerably less heroic than the shooter 's version in @entity0 , in which he says he shot @entity22 while he was standing up and only after he saw that the @entity9 leader had a gun within reach			1
the @entity30 operator who spoke to me says there is no way @entity115 could have seen a gun in @entity22 's reach because the two guns that were found in the bedroom after the shooting were only discovered after a thorough search and were sitting on a high shelf above the frame of the door that opened to the room			1
@entity75 commander rebuts ' shooter ' claim the seal operator also points out there was a discussion before the raid in which the assault team was told " do n't shoot the guy ( @entity22 ) in the face unless you have to " because the @entity143 would need to analyze good pictures of @entity22 's face for its facial recognition experts to work effectively			1
yet the shooter in the @entity0 story says he shot @entity22 on purpose twice in the forehead			1
a @entity152 official familiar with the details of the raid said the @entity30 operator 's version is in line with what happened			0
that account " has it right in my view , " the official said			0
watch computer animation of the different accounts the @entity30 operator also tells @entity32 that the shooter was " thrown off " the @entity166 , the core of the @entity30 group that carried out the @entity22 raid , because he was bragging about his role in the raid in bars around @entity173 , @entity174 , where @entity30 is based			1
in the @entity0 article , the shooter complains he is receiving no pension , since he left the military four years before the minimum 20 years required to be eligible			2
@entity32 spoke with @entity52 , the @entity0 writer , who says he passed on @entity32 's written questions about the shooter 's role in the raid to his story 's main character			1
the shooter has not responded to those questions , and @entity52 declined to be interviewed on - the - record for this story			0
@entity189 , a spokeswoman for @entity0 , said via e-mail the magazine stands by its story			2
" the @entity0 article , ' the shooter : the man who killed @entity22 , ' in the march 2013 issue , is based on information from numerous sources , including members of @entity200 himself , as well as detailed descriptions of mission debriefs			1
" more questions were raised about the @entity0 story 's version of events monday on @entity208 , a website that covers the @entity211 community			2
the queries came from former @entity214 seal @entity213 in a posting entitled , " @entity0 is screwed : duped by @entity217 ' shooter			2
' " 2011 : seals who killed @entity22 concerned for their safety according to present and former members of @entity30 , the " point man " who fired the shot that likely mortally wounded @entity22 will never " in a million years " speak publicly about his role in the raid , and they lauded his courageous decision to throw himself on the two women in @entity22 's room			1
the new account of the @entity22 raid provided by the serving @entity30 operator is essentially the same as in @entity232 's " @entity28			1
" @entity232 says he was one of the first to run into the bedroom and he saw that the point man 's shots had mortally wounded @entity22			0
@entity74 says he then shot the dying @entity9 leader as he lay on the floor			0
present and former members of @entity30 say they regard @entity232 as more credible than the shooter			0
balanced against that , according to a story filed by @entity32 's @entity242 last year , after the publication of " no @entity28 , " the head of @entity152 special operations , adm. @entity243 , contacted members of the navy seal team that killed @entity22			1
according to @entity249 officials , the @entity75 said @entity22 was standing in his bedroom when he was shot and they believed that he posed a threat because there were weapons in the room			2
this account tends to bolster the story @entity257 told @entity0			1
in a previous @entity32 story about the @entity0 profile , i noted that i was the only outside observer allowed to tour @entity22 's @entity13 compound before it was demolished in late february 2012			1
during that tour , i looked around the bedroom where @entity22 was killed			0
the @entity14 military officers who were guiding me pointed out a patch of dark , dried blood on the low ceiling of @entity22 's bedroom			0
this patch of congealed blood seems to be consistent with the shooter 's story that he fired two shots at the forehead of a " surprisingly tall terrorist " while he was standing up			0
at the time , the precise location of @entity22 when he was shot was not a matter of dispute			0
but the blood patch could also be consistent with the account that it was the " point man " who first shot @entity22			2
the point man is 5 feet 6 inches tall and was shooting upward at a tall man as he poked his head out of his bedroom			0
2011 : @entity288 meets @entity22 raiders , promises victory over @entity9 the compound is , of course , now gone , so it is no longer possible to reconstruct what happened the night of the raid based on forensic evidence , although it is possible the @entity298 , a panel that was appointed by the @entity14 government to look into the raid , could shed some light on this question should its findings ever be publicly released			2
finally , by all accounts , it was a confusing situation the night of the raid			0
one of the seal team 's helicopters had crashed and there was a firefight with one of @entity22 's bodyguards			2
all the electricity in the compound and the surrounding neighborhood was off on a moonless night and the @entity75 were all wearing night vision goggles , which only allowed them limited vision			0
what seems incontrovertible is that the point man , the shooter and @entity232 were the first three seals to assault @entity22 's bedroom			2
but to determine exactly which of them killed the @entity9 leader may never be possible			0
what is certain is that it was a team effort			1
five days after the @entity22 raid , members of the seal team who carried out the mission briefed president @entity288			1
according to those in the room , the seal team commander explained to the president , " if you took one person out of the puzzle , we would n't have the competence to do the job we did ; everybody 's vital			0
it 's not about the guy who pulled the trigger to kill @entity22 , it 's about what we all did together			0

@entity38 : member of @entity43 6 disputes @entity0 account of @entity22 raid
he says there are doubts about the story the " shooter " told to @entity0
@entity349 : killing was team effort , may not have been *connected* to @entity22 gun in the room
