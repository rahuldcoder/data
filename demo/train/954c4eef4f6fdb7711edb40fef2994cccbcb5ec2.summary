-- if @entity3 were hoping to escape their domestic troubles in @entity5 then the @entity2 champions only found more tragedy in @entity7			1
@entity8 swept aside a lackluster @entity3 side 2 - 0 to see the two - time @entity11 winners on the verge of an exit in the last 16			1
the hard - working @entity14 deflected in the ball with a deft back heel after 38 minutes to cue frenzied excitement among the red - and - white - hued home fans			2
a brilliant , second goal from @entity20 -- on loan to the @entity7 champions from @entity23 -- sealed @entity3 's fate in the second half			1
even with @entity26 and @entity27 spearheading their attack , @entity3 lacked attacking verve			0
@entity31 's best chance came in the final 10 minutes of the match when the @entity33 found himself clear on goal but skied the ball over the crossbar			0

" in tuesday 's early game , last season 's @entity11 finalists @entity64 won a lively tie with @entity66			1
the @entity68 side had strolled to an early 2 - 0 lead as @entity70 and @entity71 scored within 70 seconds of each other in the opening five minutes			1
@entity66 , featuring in the last 16 for only the second time , breathed new life into the match when @entity77 made the most of a melee in the @entity64 box to score when the ball bounced back off the post			2
the crowd at the @entity84 roared but , minutes later , @entity85 bobbled the ball beyond the @entity66 keeper to stretch the scoreline to 3 - 1			2
@entity66 were given a second chance when the referee awarded a penalty after @entity92 clumsily went down inside the area			0
@entity96 striker @entity94 muscled @entity66 back into contention as he whipped the ball into the net ; a cool strike considering he 'd missed his last three penalties			0
but the @entity103 defense buckled once more and @entity104 striker @entity85 , who is joining @entity64 's rivals @entity105 at the end of the season , stroked in a diagonal cross			0
