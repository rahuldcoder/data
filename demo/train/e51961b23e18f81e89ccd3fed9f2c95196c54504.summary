@entity0 -- president @entity2 on tuesday unveiled a $ 100 million initiative to unlock the " enormous mystery " of the human brain in hopes of boosting the understanding and treatment of brain disorders			1
" what if computers could respond to our thoughts ? or language barriers could come tumbling down ? or if millions of @entity15 were suddenly finding new jobs in these fields -- jobs we have n't even dreamt up yet because we chose to invest in this project ? that is the future we are imagining			0
that is what we are hoping for , " the president said in an event in the @entity22 of the @entity23			2

" there is this enormous mystery waiting to be unlocked , " @entity2 said , " and the @entity36 will change that by giving scientists the tools they need to get a dynamic picture of the brain in action and better understand how we think and how we learn and how we remember			1
and that knowledge could be -- will be -- transformative			0
" mapping the brain : top brain scientist is ' philosopher at heart ' @entity2 said he will seek the $ 100 million funding in the budget he sends to @entity52 next week			1
in an environment where both parties are seeking significant spending cuts , the expenditure faces an uncertain reception			0
in his remarks , @entity2 said the funding would be in line with a promise he made earlier this year to increase levels of research			1

" the money to study the brain would support research by the @entity74 , the @entity75 and the @entity76			2
the research would involve both federal research agencies and private partners			1
a major goal is to reveal " how individual brain cells and complex neural circuits interact at the speed of thought , " the @entity23 said			0
brain map seeks to unlock mysteries of the mind " our ultimate objective is a deep understanding of the human brain and its understanding , " said @entity88 , director of the @entity75 , in a conference call with reporters			0
