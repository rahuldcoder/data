-- i have been fortunate to have lived and experienced two worlds : my childhood in @entity4 -- which in many parts is a world of poverty , infrastructure problems , and a paucity of qualified health - care personnel , a world of many preventable deaths			1
the other world is the @entity13 , where my time at the @entity14 exposed me to amazing technologies , tremendous resources to build " things , " to build businesses , and where -- for the most part -- there exist reliable systems , processes and medical technology which enable us to save lives , whenever they can be saved			2
watch @entity27 's @entity26 the opportunity that exists , one might well be told multiple times , by multiple very enthusiastic and entirely well - meaning people , is to take the @entity31 and put it to good use in the so - called @entity33			2
so , that would mean that , to improve health care in the so - called @entity37 -- we should take lifesaving medical technologies that the @entity39 has developed and transplant these to countries like @entity4			1
the poster child for this kind of transplant is the mobile revolution in many developing nations like @entity4 , which have leapfrogged the rather expensive wired telephony phase altogether , and jumped straight to mobile phones			1
in @entity4 today , about half the population already owns mobile phones			1
it is not only their primary means of voice communication but also becoming their most important source of all forms of information -- business , media , health ... so can we replicate this kind of success story in health care delivery ? @entity26 : the universal anaesthesia machine can we take the cool technologies developed in @entity66 and in @entity67 , put them on @entity4 soil , amidst lower resource settings , and expect a similarly spectacular outcome in health care ? there might be a case to made for this approach , but to date my experience suggests that the problems in health care in the developing world are too complex , too entangled with other issues ( social , political , economic ) and -- in some cases -- too alien altogether from the western world perspective -- to have a simple " tech - transfer " fix			1
also , a similar problem emerges when the best brains in the @entity39 , with all the best intentions , design new products intended to solve the problems of the developing world , while not having a full knowledge or context to the problem the product is designed to solve			0
the story i told in my @entity26 talk was my personal narrative of a team of doctors , engineers and designers who were thrown into the midst of a severe problem -- anemia in children and pregnant women in a rural , underserved part of @entity4			1
as many as 1 million or more children and pregnant women are dying as direct or indirect result of undiagnosed , untreated , unmonitored anemia			0
the treatment for anemia is not only well understood , but also widely available -- iron tablets , folic acid , iron injections , supplements and in extreme cases -- blood transfusions			2
@entity26 : touring a hospital in @entity118 many government and @entity121 - backed schemes ( e.g. " @entity122 " in @entity4 ) exist that provide subsidized health care -- free treatment			1
in rural @entity4 , there is a village health worker ( @entity128 ) in every village -- a ratio of one for every 1,000 people			1
the implementation of these health - care schemes is largely on the shoulders of the @entity128 workers			2
in @entity4 there are more than 500,000 -- a really big ( if not highly qualified medically ... ) force for doing good			2
having experienced the conditions in a village in @entity4 , my group of friends -- who eventually set up the startup @entity143 -- developed a simple , hand - held device that the @entity128 worker could use to diagnose and monitor anemia noninvasively ( without needles ) and at the point of care ( she could carry the hand - held device door to door )			1
the @entity153 is designed for low - resource settings , requires no medical expertise and is perfect for the quick and affordable anemia screening it is tasked to do			0
the device emits three wavelengths of light			0
the light passes through the tissue , and from understanding how much of it is transmitted , how much of it is scattered and how much of it is absorbed , we can figure out how much hemoglobin there is in the blood			0
our insight behind the @entity153 product was not merely that anemia needed diagnosing -- this is obvious to every person in public health care			1
our insight was not merely that the @entity128 worker needed to be empowered to solve problems in her community , and that she was the real centre of the public health system , rather than the doctors sitting in cities and towns -- again , obvious to folks in the development world			2
our insight was not merely scientific -- how to develop a product that could measure blood hemoglobin and diagnose anemia all without needles and in the form of a device no bigger than a tv remote control -- there are other scientific approaches and technologies available for noninvasive hemoglobin estimation			2
@entity26 : your health depends on where you live our real insight was that we needed to not only build something that works from a scientific standpoint but also makes sense from a commercial and cultural and political - adoption angle			0
this was not easy and i can not point to any single glorious " aha " moment in time when it all clicked			0
all i have are a series of failures -- monuments to our own stupidity , ideas and prototypes and commercial models failing in the lab , in the field , in a government office , at the @entity218 ( venture capital ) meeting , failing due to some reason from a plethora of reasons in the complex entangled mesh that is @entity4			0
slowly , over three years , our team and @entity153 stumbled our way to making the beginnings of impact			0
we are still stumbling forward , but have been told we are going the right way ! i want a thousand stories like @entity153 to emerge to solve the pressing health care needs of the 3 billion underserved people in the world , dying or suffering from completely preventable diseases			1
i believe neither the " @entity237 " or the " @entity37 " can do this alone			0
the best researchers sitting at @entity14 or @entity239 do not always understand the context and nuances of the developing world 's problems they sometimes set out to solve , and the best field people in the developing world do not have the resources and scientific expertise to create robust and cutting - edge technology solutions that scale to the levels of the problem			0
@entity26 : the promise of research with stem cells there are ways around this impasse , but none are quick or simple : either technology innovators from the @entity39 who propose solutions for the @entity33 must follow through and stick it out in the field , to design and implement their vision to the end , or the developing nations must wait for a few more years while their indigenous tech innovation ecosystems mature ... in the face of this complexity , i have personally found three simple rules that i have internalized , for tech innovators to create real impact : 1 ) experience the problem : do n't assume you understand the problem			1
2 ) fail early , fail often : do n't fall in love with your ideas -- expose them as early as possible to data , to real life , and hence to failure			0
3 ) build a team : surround yourself with people smarter than you , with very diverse skill sets ... and have fun ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity27 .			0

@entity27 : mobile tech enables developing nations to leapfrog over wired systems
he says nations such as @entity4 need ways to jump ahead in health care
@entity27 : new technology is n't a magic pill ; technology must fit health care delivery system
his company developed a tool to *detect* anemia without drawing blood
