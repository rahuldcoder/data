-- @entity1 was in serious damage control mode sunday after a video of him telling a racist joke to friends surfaced			1
in the video , posted to @entity7 , the pop star , then 15 , asks : " why are black people afraid of chain saws ? " he answers his own question : " run n * * * * * , n * * * * * , n * * * * * , n * * * * * , " he says , imitating the sound of a chain saw			1
@entity7 reported it got the video four years ago but decided against posting it then because of @entity1 's age and because he " immediately told his friends what he did was stupid			1
" it was reportedly shot backstage at a promotional event			0
" as a young man , i did n't understand the power of certain words and how they can hurt			0
i thought it was ok to repeat hurtful words and jokes , but did n't realize at the time that it was n't funny and that in fact my actions were continuing the ignorance , " @entity1 , now 20 , said in a statement			2
he added : " i take my friendships with people of all cultures very seriously and i apologize for offending or hurting anyone with my childish and inexcusable mistake			1
i was a kid then and i am a man now who knows my responsibility to the world and to not make that mistake again			1
" the video is the latest in a string of troubles for the star , who shot to fame as a fresh - faced teen			0
