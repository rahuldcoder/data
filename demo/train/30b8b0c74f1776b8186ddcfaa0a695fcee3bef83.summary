-- most people know that condoms prevent the spread of @entity4 and sexually transmitted diseases ( @entity6 )			2
unusual campaigns to promote condom use are being launched in places where condoms are less popular			1
but in many parts of the world , condoms are n't very popular			2
here are five novel campaigns launched by nonprofit organizations and condom companies to encourage wider use			1
a ring tone to remember in @entity20 , people stigmatize condoms and refuse to wear them because they believe only prostitutes must use prophylactics			1
leave it to one of the world 's richest men to find a solution -- the @entity29 donated money for a national condom ring tone			1
an a cappella group sings " @entity38 " -- in the style of doo - wop like the contagious pop song " @entity37 " -- when one receives a phone call			2
despite its bubblegum sound , officials hope that the people who have the condom ring tone appear smart and responsible			1
since the ring tone 's august launch , more than 60,000 people downloaded it			1
@entity48 , country director of the @entity49 ( which the @entity29 funded ) , sums it up best when she said to @entity51 : " a ring tone is a very public thing			1
it 's a way to show you are a condom user and you do n't have any issues with it			1
" right , nothing attracts the amorous attention like announcing loudly that you have a condom			2
@entity61 you right up @entity62 claim they hate condoms because the smell of latex sickens them			2
to combat the odor , @entity66 , a @entity67 nonprofit , created coffee condoms			2
these dark brown condoms allegedly ( i 'm not testing the products ) taste and smell like the favorite coffee of @entity62 -- the macchiato , an espresso with cream and sugar			0
one college student claimed the smell reminded him of the beauty of @entity62 women ( it 's not clear if that 's a compliment )			0
these condoms bolster national identity because @entity62 claim to have invented coffee			0
@entity66 also created flavored and scented condoms for @entity88 ( durian fruit ) and @entity90 ( sweet corn )			0
@entity0 : 4 fruits we 're dying to try 3			0
condom trees in western @entity97 , the rate of hiv infection is the highest in the nation			1
when public health nurses were looking for an effective way to distribute condoms , someone suggested trees			1
young people in the countryside hang out under trees , so the shady spots are the perfect places for nurses to hang condom - filled canisters			1
over 3,000 condoms are taken each month			0
residents said grabbing condoms from trees was convenient and private			1
additionally , officials in @entity97 piloted programs where @entity118 teens sold packets of condoms and kept half of the proceeds			1
officials tout these programs as a success because @entity6 rates have fallen , yet nurses wonder how they will convince people that they should n't have multiple partners			0
maybe a monogamy tree is in the @entity130 's future			0
@entity0 : 8 smooches that ( sort of ) shook the world 4			0
scare tactics perhaps some safe sex programs skirt the issue -- unprotected sex causes @entity4 , which leads to @entity137 and often death			1
it 's not surprising that a condom company would resort to scare tactics			2
the @entity142 launched its " @entity144 " ads in @entity145			0
showing skeletons positioned in flagrante delicto , these ads make no bones about how important it is to wear a condom while engaging in coitus			0
no word if the skeleton ads have had the desired impact , though the graphic skeletons appear more popular than recent @entity158 ads , which depict men as swine			0
@entity0 : strange gravestones 5			0
spray - on protection since his teens , @entity163 struggled to find a condom that fit correctly			1
he thought the pursuit of the perfect prophylactic was hopeless -- until he went to the carwash			0
inspired by the spray - on soap and wax , the @entity169 developed a spray - on latex condom , which he claims always fits perfectly and feels natural			1
however , many men find the design off - putting ; the spray - on condom comes in a hard phallic case			1
men slide themselves into the cylinder and layer on the latex , providing full coverage			0
the @entity182 , as @entity183 dubbed it , frightened many men during the testing phase -- they only put the case on their fingers			2
( spray on gloves anyone ? ) others felt the loud hissing was n't sexy and the latex takes too long to dry -- three minutes			2
@entity183 explains to @entity193 , " it needs to be ready in five to ten seconds			0
" so for now , @entity183 is waiting for a quicker - drying latex			0
