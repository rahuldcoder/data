-- as the protests in @entity2 enter a second week , @entity0 takes a look at some of the key questions surrounding them			1
what are the protests about ? the protesters are calling for democratization -- for a government that they feel represents them			1
they want president @entity11 , 82 , to step down after 30 years holding onto power , and an end to what they complain is a corrupt regime			2
some have called for the government to face a trial			1
the anger is driven largely by economic frustrations			1
@entity21 has seen a dramatic rise in the cost of living in recent years			0
while the government has offered food subsidies to help people handle rising prices , many are struggling			1
@entity21 's economy was stagnant for decades , but in the past 10 years started to grow , creating bigger differences between rich and poor , said @entity32 , a @entity33 historian at the @entity34			0
" and i think some of the protest is over the ways in which the labor movements have gotten left behind and have n't shared in the economic growth , " he said			1
why now ? what sparked the protests ? a wave of protests in nearby @entity43 which overthrew the government helped inspire people in other nearby countries , facing similar frustrations , that it was time for an uprising			1
but the spark , in many ways , was one young man			1
@entity53 , a 26 - year - old college graduate in @entity43 , was unable to find work , so he set up a fruit cart			1
police confiscated it , saying he had no permit			0
according to the @entity60 , police also beat him			0
@entity53 set himself on fire in protest , and later died			1
his self - immolation triggered the huge protests in @entity43 , which in turn helped inspire people in other nearby countries , including @entity69 and @entity70 , to take to the streets as well			1
there have also been protests in @entity74 and @entity75			2
a facebook page calls for similar demonstrations in @entity78			0
a popular @entity80 page that helped organize the @entity2 protests beginning january 25 was dedicated to @entity53			2
who are the protesters ? many are young men			1
the majority of @entity21 's population is under 30 , and the vast majority of its unemployed are as well			2
while the protesters include people from different socio - economic levels and different parts of the country , there is a " high proportion of the educated middle class , " said @entity32			1
there 's " a feeling amongst that middle class that they 're not being given the opportunities in life that their degrees warrant -- what historians would call a ' blocked elite , ' " @entity32 said			1
have the protests been violent ? the protesters have generally been peaceful , chanting slogans and holding signs			1
last week , police clashed violently with some demonstrators , leaving some dead and others wounded			0
once the government sent in the military to take the place of police , the clashes came to a halt			2
the two sides have generally gotten along well			0
some protesters have even posed for pictures with members of the military on their tanks			2
at times , the protests have even taken on the feeling of a music festival , with people wandering around , chatting , and celebrating			2
" this is the start of the rest of my life , " one jubilant young man who appeared to be in his 20s told @entity0			1
" as cheesy as it sounds , that 's exactly how i feel right now			0
" how did chaos begin in some areas ? police disappeared from the streets in parts of @entity2 and some other areas , and some police stations were ransacked			0
over the weekend , looters attacked stores and homes and torched some cars , and some prisoners escaped			0
men gathered in neighborhoods to create vigilante groups protecting their property			0
in some places , people handed out knives , sticks , clubs , and baseball bats to men and teenage boys , encouraging them to fight any looters who came along			0
some @entity21 said they worry the chaos could be part of @entity11 's strategy , getting citizens angry at the protesters for creating havoc and excited for government security forces to come along and bring order			1
but the crime has also built more frustration against the government among many @entity21			2
how many have died ? while it 's difficult to ascertain a solid death toll , @entity172 staffers have confirmed more than 120 deaths in @entity2 , @entity176 , and @entity177 , according to a researcher for the group in @entity2			1
how is the food supply ? many families are fast running out of staples , and they are either unable or unwilling to shop for groceries			0
" i have three children , and i only have enough to feed them for maybe two more days			0
after that i do not know what we will do , " school administrator @entity186 said			0
grocers have closed up shop or are running out of supplies themselves			0
" with the curfew , there are no restaurants , food or gas			0
basic goods will soon be in shortage , " @entity198 , an @entity21 blogger said via @entity199			0
@entity21 state - run @entity202 has set up a hotline for citizens to call in and report bread shortages			2
there has been no other indication of what the @entity21 government is doing to address the crisis			2
@entity0 's @entity216 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 , and @entity215 contributed to this report .			0
