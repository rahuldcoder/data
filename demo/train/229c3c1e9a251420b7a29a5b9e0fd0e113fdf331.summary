@entity0 , @entity1 -- a federal judge on tuesday approved the extradition of former @entity6 dictator @entity5 to @entity7 , where he faces a 10 - year sentence on a conviction in absentia on money - laundering charges			1
@entity5 , in a 1989 file photo , leaves his headquarters in @entity14 , @entity6			1
magistrate @entity15 agreed with the government 's case for extraditing @entity5 to @entity7 and issued a " certificate of extradability			1
" @entity5 's lawyer , @entity20 , said he would continue to fight the extradition			1
he had said @entity5 hoped to return to @entity6 to be closer to his family			2
the issue has emerged because @entity5 is scheduled to complete his @entity1 prison term on september 9			1
the former @entity6 strongman was captured in the 1989 @entity27 military invasion of @entity6 and was convicted in 1992 of racketeering for accepting bribes to allow drugs to be shipped through @entity6 destined for the @entity27			0
his attorneys had argued that his status as a prisoner of war meant he should be returned to @entity6 , but a separate court ruling last friday rejected that argument			2
" this court never intended for the proclamation of defendant as a pow to shield him from all future prosecutions for serious crimes he is alleged to have committed , " senior u.s. district judge @entity35 wrote in friday 's 12 - page opinion			0
" it appears that the extradition proceedings should proceed uninterrupted			0
" @entity35 noted that @entity5 " has not always sought repatriation , " and had , at one time , asked to be allowed to go to a third country			0
@entity5 also faces possible prison time in @entity6 , where he is accused of kidnapping , extortion and the murder of political opponents			1
though the charges are more serious , if the 69 - year - old @entity5 is convicted of murder , he would likely serve much of his sentence under home detention in @entity6			1
@entity6 law provides home detention for anyone 74 years old or older			0
the @entity6 constitution would also forbid his extradition to @entity7			2
next month , @entity5 will have served nearly 17Â½ years of an original 40 - year sentence in the @entity27			0
the sentence was later reduced to 30 years , and further shortened for good behavior			0
e-mail to a friend @entity2 's @entity66 in @entity0 and @entity67 in @entity68 contributed to this report .			0
