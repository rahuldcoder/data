@entity1 's father expressed satisfaction wednesday with the way his son , the former @entity5 contractor , has been treated since being granted asylum in august			1
@entity7 spoke to reporters at @entity10 's @entity9 as he prepared to return to the @entity11 after a six - day visit , his first reunion with his son since april			1
" i felt that this is the best place for him , this is the place where he does n't have to worry about people rushing across the border to render him , " @entity7 said			1
" it 's not going to happen here			2
" it may not be his last visit , since his son -- charged in the @entity11 for revealing a massive government surveillance campaign -- may wind up remaining in @entity27 for years			1
" my feeling is that , unless the attitude within our government changes dramatically -- and that at a minimum is going to require a change of administration and that 's going to be in several years -- that @entity27 is the place for him to be at the current time			1
" @entity5 leaker @entity1 deserves a @entity39 , his father says though @entity27 granted @entity1 a one - year asylum , " that could easily be extended , " said his father , who described @entity10 as modern and sophisticated			1
" i could be comfortable living the rest of my life here ; i 'm certain that he could			0
" the elder @entity7 , who arrived october 10 in @entity10 , said the two visited several times			2
" he is comfortable , he is independent , he is happy -- which is important to me -- and he is absolutely committed to the decision that he made			0
" @entity7 said his son told him he had had no contact with @entity27 security or intelligence			1
he added that he did not know where his son was living			2
" i do n't have an idea			0
" @entity1 , a 30 - year - old former government it contractor , collected information on spy programs -- in which the @entity5 mined phone and internet metadata from thousands of people inside and outside of the @entity11 -- and exposed the program to the media			1
anticipating legal consequences , he fled to @entity63 in late may and flew on june 23 to @entity10 , where he holed up at the airport for more than five weeks			0
@entity11 authorities have charged him with espionage and theft of government property			1
after @entity27 granted him asylum on august 1 , he left the airport			1
@entity7 's father : ' i know my son			1
i know he loves his country			0
' @entity7 described his son as healthy and happy , with " a very substantial " international support network			2
he accused the news media of mischaracterizing what his son did			2
" so many people are so determined in the media to continue to refer to him as a leaker , " @entity7 said			2
" in fact , he 's a whistle - blower , by definition			0
" he said attempts have been made to demonize his son , but defended him			0
" he is someone who shared the truth ; he has enraged many politicians			0
not only has he enraged them , he has put their political careers at risk , as they should be			0
people who were in positions of responsibility , of oversight			0
" the reunion came after times when @entity7 said he had not expected to see his son ever again			2
" i hugged him ; it was , ' i love you son , ' ' i love you , @entity101			0
' but we hugged a little longer , a little harder , and it was certainly -- it was an important moment			0
" book deals have been dangled that could make his son a rich man , but " that is not what @entity1 wants to do , " his father said			1
though @entity1 revealed the surveillance with the assumption that he would accept the consequences , that does not mean he regrets having fled the @entity11 , nor does it mean he plans to return to face charges there , @entity7 said			1
" that is absolutely absurd , " he said			0
" nobody questions the decision that he has made , because he would be locked in a dark hole at this point , which certain people would love			0

" this is the best place for him , " @entity7 says of his son , @entity124
@entity27 's asylum could be easily extended , father says
