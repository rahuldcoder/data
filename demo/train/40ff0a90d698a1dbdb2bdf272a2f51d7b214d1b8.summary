-- governments and charities have spent billions to try to wipe out poverty , but award - winning economist @entity4 says we really do n't know if that money has been well spent			1
but as a result of @entity4 's pioneering work , we may be getting some answers to that question			1
the @entity12 professor has led the way in showing how the scientific method can be applied to determining what policies actually work			1
@entity4 last month won the @entity17 , which is awarded to an @entity20 economist under the age of 40 who has made the " most significant contribution to economic thought and knowledge			1
" in her talk at the @entity28 conference in @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity4 pointed out that @entity31 has received a great amount of development aid , but the @entity31 economies have not made a lot of progress in improving their gross domestic product			1
" if we do n't know whether we are doing any good , we are not any better than the medieval doctors and their leeches			2
sometimes the patient gets better , sometimes the patient dies			0
is it the leeches ? is it something else ? we do n't know			0
" read more about @entity4 on @entity47 in three areas , @entity4 said her research techniques can help answer vital questions : giving away bed nets treated with insecticide to prevent the spread of malaria works , despite fears by some that free nets would not be valued by recipients and might be used instead as fishing nets			1
if you want to enhance the effectiveness of the educational system in a developing country , you can sometimes have a great impact by indirect means			0
for example , if the nation is one where children suffer from intestinal worms , spending $ 100 on deworming the children can be many times more effective in getting them educated than simply spending the $ 100 on paying for teachers , school meals and other school expenses			0
in the @entity77 state of @entity78 , @entity4 found that by creating a monthly camp and giving away kilo - sized bags of lentils , there was a significant increase in the number of parents who brought their children to be immunized with potentially life - saving vaccines			2
@entity4 said , " it 's not the @entity89 anymore			2
it 's the 21st century			0
and in the 20th century , randomized , controlled trials have revolutionized medicine by allowing us to distinguish between drugs that work and drugs that do n't work			2
and you can do the same randomized , controlled trial for social policy			0
you can put social innovation to the same rigorous , scientific tests that we use for drugs			0
