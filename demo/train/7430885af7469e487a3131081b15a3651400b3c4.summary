@entity0 , @entity1 -- first , @entity3 blew the whistle on his platoon			1
now , the @entity6 apparently wants to silence him			1
in photos obtained by @entity2 , @entity3 sports bruises and abrasions on his back , chest and near his neck -- the marks of a beating inflicted by fellow soldiers as payback for reporting their rampant hashish use , the @entity6 said			1
at the time , those close to the investigation tell @entity2 , @entity3 just wanted the smoking in his tent and around him to stop			1
so he went outside his group and reported the drug use to his superiors			0
but that move , and the subsequent beating he endured for being viewed as a snitch , triggered a wide - ranging criminal investigation that has left some soldiers accused of killing innocent @entity31 civilians and others accused of posing in gruesome photos with the dead or keeping body parts as war trophies			1
now the @entity6 is doing everything it can to limit the publicity its own explosive account created			1
@entity3 , a private first class now back in the @entity40 , had agreed to speak with @entity2 about the torment he went through at the hands of fellow soldiers earlier this year			1
but just three hours before the interview was to take place in @entity0 , @entity2 received this e-mail from his military attorney , capt. @entity46 , @entity46 , abruptly pulling the plug on the scheduled interview : " about two hours ago , prosecutors and i met re [ regarding ] the disposition of the case against @entity53 , '' the attorney wrote			2
" based on this meeting , @entity53 will be given full immunity in this case and not be prosecuted for any allegations made against him , contingent also however , on staying away from the media			0
" the @entity6 disputes that account , however , saying @entity3 has not been given immunity			1
" discussing @entity53 's direct involvement in these hearings is inappropriate and could affect the outcome of these cases , " lt. col. @entity61 , a spokesman for the @entity6 's @entity62 , told @entity2 in a statement issued thursday			1
" it is imperative that we follow the judicial process in order to provide the accused a fair and impartial trial , while at the same time serve justice , " @entity61 said			0
" @entity53 is currently not charged in these matters , nor has he been granted immunity by the convening authority for his cooperation in these ongoing investigations			0
" what is clear is the @entity6 is scrambling to contain the news of an apparently out - of - control platoon			1
the portrait of rogue soldiers at a forward operating base in @entity31 has been painted by the @entity6 itself in chilling charge sheets leveled at 12 members of the @entity88 , 2nd @entity89 , based out of @entity90 outside @entity91 , @entity1			1
five of the dozen are charged with pre-meditated murder in what investigators call the " staged " killings of three civilian @entity31			1
those soldiers and the others face various other charges as well from unlawful use of illicit drugs , possession of a human skull , fingers and leg bones to the assault on @entity3			1
two directives have been sent to military and civilian attorneys representing the @entity111 dozen			0
they involve grisly photos allegedly showing dead bodies and body parts , and soldiers posing as if they had killed a deer on a hunt			1
one of the orders commanded military defense attorneys to return all " documents inadvertently provided by the government " on september 9			0
the marked exhibits , lawyers told @entity2 , correspond to the photos			2
a number of lawyers have told @entity2 the photos are worse than those that depicted humiliating poses of @entity132 prisoners at the infamous @entity134 prison			2
those photos sparked outrage and riots in parts of the world			0
another directive apparently was meant for civilian attorneys and not only pointedly ordered the return of photos but further said defense and prosecution teams could only view them at @entity90			0
lawyer @entity147 , who represents @entity148			2
@entity149 , told @entity2 the order makes it difficult to represent their client , because it prohibits them from forensic testing and they are housed in many cases thousands of miles from where the lawyers are based			2
other attorneys have similarly complained to @entity2 that the @entity6 is tying their hands in defending their clients to avoid more embarrassment			1
@entity149 is charged with premeditated murder in a january killing			2
@entity147 said his client is innocent of the charges and was denied representation for 20 days , despite repeatedly asking for an attorney while still in @entity31			2
both orders were signed by col. @entity168 , the brigade 's commander			0
the second directive reads , in part : " further i order that all such images may not be distributed to any persons outside of personnel assigned to @entity176			0
' @entity177 ' are defined as dead , wounded or injured human beings to include separated body parts , organs , and biological materials , resulting from either combat or non-combat activities			1
'' even without those photos surfacing , much has already leaked out about the case , spurred in no small part by the @entity6 's release and description of grisly details in the charging documents			1
and the headlines around the world about the rogue unit have created a backlash in a part of the world where the @entity6 desperately hopes to win over hearts and minds			2
the beating of @entity3 and the murders of @entity31 apparently just for sport and then staged to look like combat casualties - have been highlighted by some of the accused soldiers ' whose own words captured on interrogation tapes obtained by @entity2			1
tapes describe killings for sport in one of those videotaped sessions , cpl. @entity212 -- who has been charged in all three of the killings -- recounts how he and several other soldiers deliberately ambushed @entity3 on may 5			1
" so yeah , we walked into the room and locked the door behind us and a couple guys started talking to him , laying on him , " @entity217 told investigators			0
asked by investigator what he meant , @entity217 replied , " why would you rat out your guys , stuff like that			0
" he said @entity3 initially denied he went to superiors , then admitted it as he was being confronted by their squad leader , staff sgt. @entity231			2
" i think someone had grabbed him at that point and maybe punched him in the chest or something , " @entity217 said on the tape			0
" he then made a comment like you guys can sit here and punch me all day long if you want and once he said that , @entity231 was like ok , grabbed him off his cot and threw him on the ground in his room and that 's when a few guys got some licks in			0
" @entity217 's attorney , @entity250 , said his client was on prescription drugs from the @entity6 , high on hashish and suffering combat - related injuries when the crimes were committed			1
the @entity6 has recommended @entity217 be court - martialed			1
@entity231 ' attorney said he is not ready to comment on the case			0
but @entity231 has been charged with the most crimes , and is depicted in the interrogation tapes made by some of the accused and in witness statements as the ringleader who reveled in his kills and dropped three human fingers in front of @entity3 after the beating			1
other soldiers told investigators that @entity231 liked to collect fingers , teeth and leg bones as souvenirs			0
@entity231 is also suspected of being a skinhead who kept track of his " kills " with skull tattoos on his leg			0
reports show @entity6 sgt. tracked kills with tattoos @entity2 has obtained investigators ' photos of the tattoos clearly showing skulls and cross bones			1
one soldier , not charged , said @entity231 " associates with skinheads online			0
" it 's scary because they are worse than most gang members i 've met , " the soldier told investigators			0
the photos are included in over 1,000 pages of evidence compiled by the @entity6 and turned over to attorneys			2
they include witnesses ' statements and depict a platoon where @entity231 ruled -- and anyone who did n't follow his rules believed they could end up like @entity3			2
" i take that man very seriously , " spc. @entity212 told investigators in his videotaped confession			0
" he likes to kill things			0
he is pretty much evil incarnate			0
i mean i have never met a man who can go from one minute joking around then mindless killings			0
i mean he likes to kill things			0
" @entity319 is charged with premeditated murder in a may killing of an @entity31 civilian whose death was made to look like a hostile enemy battlefield death			1
his lawyer , @entity325 , said his client is not guilty of premeditated murder despite what his client told investigators on the videotaped interrogation			0
the @entity6 is now investigating claims by @entity319 's father , @entity319 , that it ignored his attempts to warn them about @entity231			1
warning may have been ignored the elder @entity319 told @entity2 that his son alerted him after the first killing , and he said two more men died needlessly after that because the @entity6 would not listen to his warnings			1
in addition , the @entity6 reportedly is re-examining @entity231 ' role in the 2004 shooting of two adults and a child in @entity132 , near the city of @entity346			2
the shooting involved a car which purportedly was swerving towards a uniformed patrol			0
spc. @entity212 is the fifth member of the @entity352 charged with premeditated murder			2
his attorney , @entity354 , said his client is innocent			0
the @entity6 , meanwhile , seems to have decided to let the charging documents be its official comment			2
" i do n't want to do anything that could in any way jeopardize the prosecution or their ability of the defendants in this case to get a fair trial , " @entity357 , a @entity358 spokesman , told reporters october 5			0
