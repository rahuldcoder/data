@entity0 -- state investigators concluded there were " no safety threats " at the home of a 10 - year - old girl two days before she was found dead in her adoptive father 's pick - up truck near her seriously ill twin brother , according to a report released monday by @entity11 child welfare authorities			1
both of the twins ' adoptive parents -- mother @entity16 and father @entity16 -- are charged with first - degree murder in the girl 's death			1
they also each face seven counts of aggravated child abuse and seven counts of child neglect , with the mother being so charged saturday and the father charged on all the counts monday			1
@entity25 , director of the @entity26 , told reporters monday that the girl died and the boy was found only after an extended period of " systemic long - term abuse			1
" " this is , in my experience , one of the saddest commentaries on the human condition that i 've ever seen , " @entity25 said , calling the parents ' alleged behavior " subhuman			1
" " it 's depressing , it 's sickening			0
" @entity16 earlier pleaded not guilty on charges of attempted first - degree murder with a weapon and aggravated child abuse with a weapon in the case			1
days before the twins were found , the @entity47 received tips alleging poor treatment of children at the @entity16 household in @entity53			1
records indicate a 7 - year - old also lived in the home			1
one caller on february 10 claimed that the 10 - year - old girl and another child had been " tied by their hands and feet with tape , and made to stay in the bathtub all day and night as a form of punishment , " with the tape removed only so they could eat , according to a copy of the report released monday			1
then , on february 12 , authorities began looking into another claim that one of the @entity74 ' children needed stitches after being hurt on the face and lip			0
@entity16 applied a bandage but did n't take the child to the hospital			2
the mother said the child fell -- though the report notes that " the injury is not consistent with the story			2
" investigators went to the home and late that night filed a report , in which they did not find any reasons for concern for the children 's well - being			1
" there is no reason to believe that the family is about to flee or refuse access to the children , " investigator @entity93 said in the " initial in home safety assessment " report			2
" the home was observed , and there were no hazardous conditions			0
" the report concluded with an assessment that the risk to the children was " moderate , " with no risk of abuse			2
" there are no concerns for the safety of the children while in the care of the parents , " the investigator writes			2
two days later , on february 14 , authorities say @entity16 parked his pest - control truck alongside @entity120			0
a roadside ranger said he found @entity16 beside the truck and his adopted son ill inside the vehicle , which was filled with toxic chemicals			0
the boy was taken to a hospital to be treated for severe burns			0
the body of the @entity74 ' adopted daughter , @entity130 -- who was the boy 's twin sister -- was later discovered in the back of the truck in a plastic bag			1
the @entity47 held its fourth of five scheduled meetings monday afternoon to examine how authorities had handled the case			0
in one instance , a caller told @entity11 authorities that he knew the @entity141 , and he was worried about the couple 's twins			2
the contents of that phone call , which was made two days before the twins were found , was released last week by the department			0
the caller said he was worried that something sinister had happened to the 10 - year - old girl because the @entity141 could not explain where the girl was			1
" ( @entity16 ) does n't come out with a straight answer , which is worrying me so much that something might have happened to that little girl , " said the caller , who was not named			0
during monday 's press conference , @entity154 -- the state attorney for @entity53 -- said the surviving children in the @entity141 ' home " clearly are key witnesses " in the case , describing their cooperation with investigators thus far as " very courageous			0
" @entity154 said a decision has n't been made yet on whether prosecutors would seek a death sentence in this case , though she signalled that this scenario appeared likely			0
" if there ever was a case that the death penalty would apply , it would seem to apply to this one , " she said .			0
