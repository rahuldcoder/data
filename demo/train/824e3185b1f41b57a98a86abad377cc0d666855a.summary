-- my prized @entity2 sweatshirt sits stuffed in the back of my closet			2
the oversized " we are @entity2 " license plate that once perched above the door of my @entity9 office , has been put away , along with photos of me as a proud , smiling cheerleader for the @entity13			0
and weeks ago when my son received his very first college acceptance letter from my alma mater , @entity2 -- a moment i thought would be one of the pinnacles in my life -- we both tossed the letter aside and prayed that he 'd get accepted into a " better school			0
" ( our prayers were answered			0
) i have @entity24 to thank for this change of heart			1
reaction to the @entity24 verdict friday night , @entity24 â € ” the former @entity2 assistant football coach -- was found guilty on 45 of 48 counts related to sexual abuse of boys over a 15 - year period			1
the jury took just two days to untangle this horrendous story and make a decision			0
and though some felt @entity24 would walk , i could not imagine how 12 jurors could listen to the courageous , heartbreaking testimony of all of those victims and believe that it was all a conspiracy , that those young men had all lied about the abuse charges just so they could file civil suits against an innocent @entity24 , as his defense lawyer claimed			1
seeing this unimaginable story unfold for months has altered my perspective on sports forever			2
i 've worked as a sports journalist for more than 15 years , but through all the steroid stories , the accounts of domestic abuse , the gambling and corruption cases , i never lost my joy for sports -- football coming first in my world order			1
then @entity24 happened and i felt sick			1
@entity57 died and i felt heartbroken and betrayed			0
clearly , none of my emotions can ever compare to the pain and loss of innocence of @entity24 's victims and their families			1
but this story has taken away my unabashed enthusiasm as a sports fan			2
maybe it 's because i 'm the mother of an athlete			2
or that i attended @entity2 and knew many of the people involved in the story			0
and , like so many others , i can now look back and realize that something was a little creepy about the vibe around the @entity77 program and coach @entity24			1
jury finds @entity24 guilty on dozens of child sex abuse charges @entity2 's standout linebacker @entity80 played for @entity24			1
@entity80 , who was mentioned many times in the trial by @entity83 , recalled in a column for @entity85 that he knew @entity86 well , and that the young man always seemed " mad and distant			2
" " my preconceived notion was that he was part of @entity24 's @entity77 foundation , so he must live in a troubled home , and i chalked it up to that , " @entity80 wrote			1
" i would just tell him to smile every once in a while or laugh , that it would make him feel better			0
... it 's mind - blowing to realize that a kid i took an active interest in during my time at school was suffering right in front of me and i had no idea that the pain allegedly came from someone in my own football program , " said @entity80			2
@entity106 is one of the most decent athletes i have had the pleasure of working with			0
and i share some of his guilt			0
i 've seen the world of sports up close and have always known about stories like @entity24			1
mostly , those stories are treated as one - time events by wayward coaches , or viewed as one sports program gone wrong			1
we in the media never stay on these investigative stories for long			1
and reporters have a very difficult time pitching abuse stories to an editor			1
though most sports journalists will never admit this , the main goal in sports reporting is to celebrate and illuminate the games			0
constantly uncovering ugly issues in sports does not make a sports reporter a superstar at the office			0
sports media are just too close to the games financially and socially to fully examine the depths of sports culture			1
since @entity24 , each time i go to a game -- college , pro or high school - i ca n't help but wonder if any of those young men have ever been abused by a coach			1
at least one study indicates that one out of every six boys is sexually abused by the age of 14 , a shocking statistic			0
recently , i watched with happiness as @entity154 and @entity155 won their first @entity156 together			0
but i could n't help but wonder if they , or their teammates , had ever been preyed upon by a coach when they were young boys			0
@entity24 's son fits pattern of other alleged victims and the loving bear hugs that my son 's high school coach always gives players after a big win had me looking twice at him and the boys to see if i could detect any signs of unwanted behavior			1
and he knows why i 'm looking twice			0
i 'm not the only parent on high alert			0
am i being overly sensitive ? a bit too dramatic ? do n't think so			0
this story has made me realize an important truth : sports are the perfect playground for pedophiles			1
we will never be able to fully protect children from evil predators like @entity24			1
but we do n't have to be helpless			0
@entity186 , what have we learned ? will anything change after the headlines recede ? what can we do to educate and protect our sons and daughters from the @entity191 lurking among them ? it 's time to pull back the curtains on the predatory culture in sports , for journalists to pay more attention to these types of stories			1
it 's time for parents and schools , starting at least at a middle - school level , to talk to kids about inappropriate behavior and how predators operate			1
this does n't have to be a sex education class , but certainly schools could begin incorporating into a curriculum instruction in how to recognize and report inappropriate words or touches by coaches and / or teachers			1
in corporate america , nearly every @entity216 department has mandatory " @entity219 " for employees			0
even as adults these conversations are never comfortable			0
by beginning to educate children about sexual abuse we can hopefully open up such conversations to help arm our kids as they grown into adults			1
we can make it easier for the next assistant coach like @entity229 , who testified that he witnessed a child being raped by @entity24 , to immediately take action and call the police instead of second - guessing himself and doing nothing to protect the child			2
we 've learned that adults need to be educated as much as children about how to recognize and expose pedophiles			2
a child who is abused needs to understand immediately that something is wrong and that her or she must tell somebody			0
if we do n't teach them , they have no chance at all against pedophiles			2
telling our kids to stay away from sports or great college programs like @entity2 is n't really the answer			1
this is not just a @entity2 problem			0
it 's a sports problem			2
i know that just as i also know that my love of sports will return			0
but this time around , i 'll be an older and much wiser cheerleader for the games i love			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity259 .			2

@entity259 says the @entity24 trial and verdict has affected her joy at sports
she says in *retrospect* , @entity24 's @entity77 creepy ; such things did n't get talked about
she says sports media ignores abuse stories ; this must stop . kids , adults need education
@entity276 : kids sports can attract pedophiles ; fight back by teaching kids about abuse
