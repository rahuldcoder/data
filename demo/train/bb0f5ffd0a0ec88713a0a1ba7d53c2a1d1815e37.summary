a coalition of @entity1 reformist groups had urged opponents of @entity1 's hardline regime to stage nonviolent protests at central @entity0 's @entity29 on thursday , on the official anniversary of the ouster of @entity1 's shah			1
however , the @entity1 government deployed thousands of police and plainclothes @entity36 militiamen in @entity0 and other cities to quash anti-government protests during anniversary celebrations			1

it was controlled entirely , it was impossible to protest the way people protested before , " said @entity46 , author of " @entity47 in @entity1			1
" follow @entity2 's special coverage on @entity1 " so the dangers were much higher today			1
" witnesses said there was some confusion about organizing the protests ; for example , it was n't clear to some whether they were supposed to hold up their signs before or after they arrived at @entity29 , where president @entity62 was to speak			1
it appeared that the strength of the opposition response was less than other recent days of unrest in @entity1 , namely the protests on the holy day of @entity69 in late december			1
because of reporting restrictions , there was no way to independently confirm the turnout of the opposition			0
@entity46 said the so - called @entity75 , which is demanding democracy and fair elections , suffered a " numbers shock			0

" " plainclothes militia physically assaulted her and beat her with batons at her head and back			0
@entity201 after this incident with the support of a large crowd of people who made a human shield to protect her , was able to leave the area , " the @entity108 page said			0
@entity1 's official @entity214 took note of opposition protests , saying " a few hundred supporters " of @entity104 and @entity96 gathered in a western @entity0 district , and @entity96 was seen among the demonstrators			1

@entity62 's speech at @entity29 ended without incident			2
" there are those who stand against us because what they want is to control the @entity302 and to control the world , " @entity62 said			0
" and an independent @entity1 , a free @entity1 , a developed @entity1 , a powerful @entity1 will naturally be a challenge for their goal			2
and that is why they are hostile to the @entity1 nation			2
" since a disputed presidential election in june , anti-government protesters have turned public gatherings into rallies against hard - liner @entity62 , who was declared the overwhelming winner of the race , and street demonstrations were anticipated on the anniversary of the @entity6			2

in the latest big street confrontation , on the holy day of @entity69 in december , witnesses said hundreds of people were detained and seven were killed , with responsibility for the fatalities denied by the @entity1 regime			0
as the anniversary day approached , opposition leaders urged their followers to demonstrate peacefully , and @entity1 has imposed tight restrictions on foreign reporters covering the anniversary , busing them to and from @entity62 's speech to prevent them from reporting on skirmishes on the streets			1
the precautions were meant to prevent a repeat of overt anti-government displays on other key occasions that have embarrassed and inflamed @entity1 authorities			0
