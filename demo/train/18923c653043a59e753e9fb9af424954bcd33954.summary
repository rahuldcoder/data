-- economic sanctions have effects , says an expert at @entity4 , but not all may be intended			1

in @entity13 -- where oil exports provide about 70 % of government revenues according to the @entity16 -- ongoing sanctions that bar the export of oil are hurting its economy			1

@entity5 , an economics professor and expert on sanctions , says the economic restrictions on @entity13 could be dangerous for the global oil trade and threatens safe passage through the @entity48 , a narrow shipping lane in the @entity50			1
" if you squeeze and squeeze and you do n't allow the @entity13 to sell any oil , then what do they have to lose by shutting the @entity48 down ? and if they do that , that 's 35 % of all the world 's oil that comes through the strait and 20 % of the liquefied natural gas in the world , " @entity5 says			1
@entity5 adds if the @entity48 is shut down for even a week , the economic impact would be " bigger than any bomb we could conceive of			2
" looking elsewhere in the world , @entity5 points to relations between the @entity27 and @entity68 as another example of sanctions not succeeding			2
