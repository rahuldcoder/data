-- if your @entity2 's resolutions have lasted this long , congratulations			2
you 're 1/366th of the way home			2
but it 's not too late to throw a few more on the pile			2
and since half of us spend an hour or more online every day , according to the @entity13 's internet and @entity14 , it 's worth considering a few web resolutions to go along with those vows to drop some pounds or put down the smokes			1
here are a few suggestions for digital behaviors you might want to resolve to drop in 2012			1
you can feel better about yourself while making the @entity20 a happier place			2
copy - and - pasted @entity24 statuses guess what ? we can pretty much promise that even more than 97 % of us wo n't copy and paste the @entity24 status update that you copied and pasted from someone else ( who , in turn , predicted that 97 % of people would n't copy and paste it )			1
first , some math. if 97 % of @entity24 's purported 800 million users do n't copy and paste your status , that means that 24 million people will			1
congratulations -- you just created one of the most popular things ever on @entity24			1
feel strongly about a cause ? write your thoughts about it			2
once we 've seen the same thing five or 10 times , we 'll stop being sympathetic even if you 're taking a stand against the cudgeling of baby seals or something			2
and the ones that claim to share some tidbit of shocking information ? the vast majority are bunk			0
we 'd say about 97 % of them			0
mangling the @entity58 language on @entity59 we get that @entity59 is meant to be quick			1
and that sometimes you have to tighten up the spelling to get your words of wisdom down to 140 characters or less			1
but for the love of @entity67 ( 16 million followers ) , take five seconds to get " it 's " and " its " or " they 're , " " there " and " their " right			0
you 'll probably hold onto more followers in the new year if your tweets do n't hurt their brains			0
and , if you 're a celebrity , take the time to avoid reminding us that your clever dialogue came from a screenwriter or those meaningful lyrics were penned for you by a songwriter			1
lame online comments we get it			0
when you combine " people " and " sheep , " you get " sheeple			1
" and , at some point , somebody probably felt proud of the new portmanteau he dreamed up to insult folks on the @entity20 whose opinions differed from his own			0
( pardon the pronoun ... but you know it was a guy			0
) look ... the @entity98 gives us the ability to communicate in real time with people we 've never met , all over the world			1
is " this is @entity107 's fault " -- on a news story about a lost kitten -- really the best we can do ? and do n't get us started on " first ! " we 'd love to see online commenting take a step forward in 2012 and have people shoot for the kind of conversations we 'd like to have if we were all sitting together over a cup of coffee or cold beer			1
but we 'd settle for not seeing " @entity115 " used as a noun			0
( note : we 're well aware this item guarantees that all the bad behavior we just mentioned will now appear in the comments below			1
go for it if you must -- just do n't think we did n't see it coming			0
) inviting @entity98 karma do you run an online business ? are you hoping to get elected ? @entity125 ... do you do just about anything that involves dealing with other human beings ? then do n't be a jerk			1
it will just make the watchdogs of the @entity98 have to waste time taking you to the digital woodshed			1
remember the customer service rep who recently told a customer whose video - game controller order had been repeatedly delayed to " grow up " ? ( the rep also helpfully called him a " complete moron			1
" ) the guy was fired after sites such as @entity141 got their hands on the e-mail chain			0
did your airline break a musician 's guitar ? pay him for it , or he 'll write a catchy country song and post it on @entity151 , where 11 million people will see it			1
want to charge your customers $ 2 just to make their payments online ( the quickest , most environmentally friendly and easiest - to - process way ) ? they 'll hound you online so mercilessly that you 'll have to change your mind the next day			2
yes , @entity159 , we 're looking at you			0
we 've got this great big tool to tell lots of folks about your wrongdoings really fast			0
so resolve to be nice			2
smartphone misbehavior just because your phone lets you get on the @entity98 does n't mean you have to tweet -- or heaven forbid , make a call -- on the toilet			1
you do n't have to bury your face in @entity170 while you 're walking down the hall , putting us both at risk of a collision and concussion			0
boy , do we ever get it			0
those super-computers in our pockets are alluring in a way that not much technology has ever been			0
we get hooked ourselves sometimes			0
but you can put your phone away once in a while			0
if you try hard , you can make it through 2012 without texting in front of us in the movie theater or while weaving through rush - hour traffic			1
and while we 're at it , here 's a tip for you @entity192 employees : try to get through 2012 without leaving any @entity194 prototypes in bars			2
really , you can do it .			0

in 2012 , resolve to kill off these bad behaviors on the web
that copy - and - pasted @entity24 status ? try writing your own instead
avoid bad @entity59 spelling and comment - *section* trolling
deal with the public ? treat people well , or the @entity98 watchdogs will not be *pleased*
