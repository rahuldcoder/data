-- you probably could 've guessed it was a @entity3 show just by the shirts the men in the audience wore : collared , short - sleeved and oversized , with palm trees , hibiscus flowers and nautical gear printed all over them			1
at the back of the stage , surfboards were lined up like @entity15 columns on either side of a huge video screen			0
it was n't until midway through the band 's second set that @entity21 acknowledged what half the people in the audience must 've been thinking : " it 's , uh , been a little while since we 've all been on tour together			1
" this year , the @entity3 turn 50			1
until the @entity30 this past february , @entity27 , the band 's troubled heart , had n't been on stage with the rest of them since 1996			1
the tour kickoff last night at the @entity35 in @entity36 was , in that sense , a milestone : not only a marker of their anniversary , but of a public reconciliation between @entity27 and the band 's other surviving original members : @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity27 's cousin , @entity21			1
it 's not until a band like the @entity3 runs through their hits back - to - back in rapid succession that you realize just how many hits they 've had			1
over the course of nearly two and a half hours , they played an astonishing 42 songs , many of them medley - style , with nearly no banter in between			1
amid the most familiar stuff -- " @entity63 , " " @entity64 , " " @entity65 " -- were a healthy number of deep cuts and covers , including " @entity69 " and @entity70 's " then he kissed me , " which @entity46 probably wisely rephrased as " then i kissed her			2
" there were also two uncanny video appearances by @entity75 and @entity76 , both of whom died years ago			0
( @entity76 " sang " " forever , " while @entity75 took on " @entity80 , " a song @entity82 wrote for him on 1966 's @entity83			2
) and about halfway through the second set , something new showed up : a reflective midtempo ballad called " @entity87 " -- a moment that , like so much of the band 's best music , elevated the adolescent to the divine			1
onstage , @entity21 was a low - key kind of showboat , stepping back and forth with the beat , miming the revving of a motorcycle engine on " @entity98 " and hugging his elbows when he sang " and the northern girls with the way they kiss , they keep their boyfriends warm at night " on " @entity63			0
" @entity82 seemed placid and stone - faced , sitting at the bench of a large white grand piano			0
" ladies and gentlemen , @entity27 , " @entity46 said after " @entity106 , " at which point the crowd rose to their feet in reverence as he sat , blinking			1
in a sense , @entity21 and @entity27 have always been spiritual opposites : @entity82 wanted to escape to the solace of his bed on " @entity117 " ; @entity21 wanted to escape to the solace of tropical beaches on " @entity120			2
" they are as strange a pair as they 've ever been , but it 's their balance -- between @entity82 's quiet yearning and @entity21 's inability to have anything short of a good time -- that creates the band 's strange chemistry			1
and while this was in some ways a show about @entity27 , the @entity3 are a highly professional enterprise that depend on highly professional people			1
at any given time there were between six and fifteen hands on stage , including multitaskers on various saxophones and someone to pick up the @entity145 horn on " @entity80 , " the harmonica on " @entity147 " and the theremin for " @entity65			0
" oh , and do that singing thing they do , too			0
considering it was the first night of a semi-momentous reunion tour , there was n't a whole lot of sentimentality going back and forth , which is n't to say the band did n't care about each other , only that they probably cared about the audience more			2
there were moments , though , between the childhood photographs of the band flashing on the big screen and the brief congratulations they gave each other between songs , that the weight of their history together was felt			2
at the end of " @entity172 ) , " @entity46 looked at the floor , shook his head and laughed			0
in the 50 years between then and now , they 'd grown up			0
throughout the night , a security guard patiently collected beach balls that had traveled through the crowd , stockpiling them behind a large speaker at stage right			0
by the end of the second set , the pile had reached halfway up the speakers to the jumbo screen , where @entity82 's white grand piano lingered on the screen for a second , then disappeared			2
during the encore he batted them back into the crowd , one by one			0
