inspiration can come from unlikely places			1
@entity2 found the will to change his life in a drawing game			1
@entity2 was addicted to alcohol , severely morbidly obese and full of self - pity when he met @entity7 through a random match on @entity9 , the @entity10 - like mobile game			1
it was the spring of 2012			2
most nights @entity2 drank around a fifth of vodka mixed with a liter of soda while he zoned out in front of the tv			1
the last time he had been weighed , on a special scale at the hospital , he was 625 pounds			1
@entity7 lived in @entity21 and was 20 years @entity2 's senior			1
at first , the players shared casual banter between rounds			2
their friendship eventually moved to @entity27 , where they began to confide in each other			2
@entity2 was at a low point			1
besides being an alcoholic and morbidly obese , he was pre-diabetic and had a recurring cellulitis infection			2
@entity7 was the first person he was totally honest with -- no one in his life knew about the drinking			1
but she was n't having it			2
" she said there were people struggling for their lives and then there 's you -- you have all these opportunities and you 're throwing it all away , " said @entity2 , 32 , now a business relations representative and part - time music teacher in @entity40 , @entity41			1
it was personal for @entity7 , who lives with myotonic dystrophy , an inherited type of muscular dystrophy that causes progressive muscle weakness and can affect various systems and organs			2
her symptoms have been relatively mild so far , but she never takes her health for granted			2
" i just thought bloody hell , you 're a guy who 's 30 ... and you 're wasting your life , " she said , remembering how she felt as the recipient of his drunken , maudlin messages			1
" my future is a lot gloomier			2
i 'm trying to make the brightest future i can , and ... you 're dragging yourself down			2
" it was the wake - up call @entity2 needed			1
he 'd show her he could change			2
that day -- october 13 , 2012 -- he vowed to quit drinking cold turkey			1
that was the first step toward what would become a remarkable transformation			2
less than two years later , @entity2 has lost more than 380 pounds from his 6 foot 2 frame			1
he went from a size 60 waist to a size 38			2
the days after he gave up alcohol were grueling , he said			0
he had cold sweats , shaky hands and could n't sleep			0
he kept busy to distract himself and found comfort in daily chats with @entity7			0
they progressed from @entity27 to @entity85 video chats , where @entity7 said she was initially shocked by his size			0
the weight began to fall off			0
without the extra calories from alcohol , @entity2 lost 100 pounds in a couple months			1
that was motivation enough to make other changes			0
he had been consuming upwards of 7,000 calories a day , according to an app he used to record his meals			0
he stopped eating fast food and cut out sugar and red meat			0
now , a typical day for @entity2 starts with a few ounces of low or no - sodium turkey breast , a serving of dry cereal , a bowl of non-fat @entity106 yogurt with artificial sweetener and a glass of low - sodium vegetable juice			1
for lunch and dinner , he often eats chicken and vegetables with rice			0
and every friday night , he treats himself to a scoop of ice cream			0
now that he 's doing more exercise , he 's not as strict about his diet			0
adding in physical activity was a gradual process			0
@entity2 says he began by walking in place in his parents ' basement for five minutes a day every morning , adding minutes as he felt ready			1
when he was finally comfortable to exercise outside , he only went when it was dark and the neighbors could n't see him			0
@entity7 kept him company on @entity85 sometimes while he walked			0
" she was a huge motivation			0
she 'd try to push me to walk a little further each time , " he said			0
in july 2013 , he walked his first half - marathon			0
shortly after that he took up cycling , and then running , completing his third 5 - kilometer run on his birthday a few weeks ago			0
he used running and calorie tracker apps to stay accountable and started seeing a psychotherapist to manage his depression and make sure he was approaching his weight loss in a healthy way			0
upwave : try it now ! track your progress with @entity141 @entity7 said she encouraged it , not wanting him to be dependent on their friendship to stay sober and motivated			0
@entity2 is now down to 234 pounds , with about 30 pounds of excess skin around his waist			1
he 's trying to save the money for surgery to have it removed			0
this past december , he went to @entity151 and finally met @entity7 in person , where he was able to climb the @entity154 after barely being able to walk up a flight of stairs less than two years earlier			1
they continue to talk every day -- and are still playing draw something			0
@entity2 now hopes to go back to school to become a therapist specializing in weight loss , depression and anxiety			1
" @entity7 is the best thing that 's ever happened to me			0
i feel that she saved my life , even though she would never take credit , " @entity2 wrote in a blog post			1
" @entity2 is so inspiring , " @entity7 said			1
