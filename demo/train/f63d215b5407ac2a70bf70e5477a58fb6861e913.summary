@entity0 -- undeterred by the embarrassment of a failed rocket launch earlier this year , @entity2 appears to be pressing ahead with the development of long - range missiles , according to an analysis of satellite images by a @entity10 academic website			1
drawing on commercial satellite imagery , the website @entity13 suggests that the reclusive @entity2 regime has carried out at least two tests of large rocket motors at the @entity17 on the country 's west coast since april			1
that 's the same site from which the nuclear - armed @entity13 launched a long - range rocket on april 13 that broke apart shortly after takeoff			1
@entity24 said the rocket was supposed to put a satellite in orbit , but the launch was seen by many other countries as cover for a ballistic missile test			2
the most recent test of a large rocket motor at @entity34 took place in mid-september , according to the analysis posted monday by @entity13 , which is run by the @entity37 at @entity38			1
" these tests , critical for the development of new rockets , appear to have been of liquid - fueled , first stage engines " for the type of satellite launch vehicle that failed in april or a new long - range missile that was on show at a parade in @entity24 this year , 38 @entity13 said			1
another big rocket launch would further sour @entity2 's relations with the @entity10 and @entity50			1
the failed launch in april scuppered a deal for @entity53 to provide thousands of tons of food aid to the @entity13 's malnourished population			1
it also drew condemnation from the @entity59 , which repeated demands for @entity24 not to carry out similar tests in the future			0
the botched launch followed previous attempts in 2006 and 2009			0
the difference this year was @entity2 's decision to invite members of the international news media inside the country during the launch period , allowing them to visit the @entity34 station ahead of the launch			2
@entity2 state - run media also reported the rocket 's failure to put a satellite in orbit , something they had n't done for the two previous launches			2
but the setback has n't stopped @entity24 from vaunting its alleged military capabilities			0
last month , it said its missiles could reach the @entity10 mainland , a claim questioned by some analysts			0
the unsuccessful satellite launches in 2006 and 2009 were both followed weeks or months later by nuclear tests			1
that has n't happened so far this time , but 38 @entity13 warned monday that it remains a possibility			0
" in the aftermath of the @entity10 and @entity50 presidential elections , @entity24 may embark on a new round of activities in the first half of 2013 , including rocket and nuclear tests that will contribute to further development of its nuclear deterrent , " the website said			1
president @entity104 was reelected this month in the @entity10 , and the @entity50 presidential election takes place next month			0
@entity50 officials have said they believe the @entity13 is ready to carry out a nuclear test whenever leaders in @entity24 make " a political decision " to go ahead with it			0
the 38 @entity13 article monday also noted construction activity on the upper gantry platform of the launch area at @entity34 that would tally with future launches of long - range rockets that are much larger than the one that failed in april			1
the website said it had previously reported indications that @entity2 was working on such a rocket			2
the analysis of the satellite pictures for 38 @entity13 was provided by @entity124 , who has specialized in image technology during a 43 - year career in intelligence for the @entity10 military and private sector			2
he pointed to the removal of fuel tanks , the appearance of exhaust stains and the apparent scorching of nearby vegetation between april and september as signs of rocket engine tests at @entity34			0
the @entity50 defense and unification ministries declined to comment on the article from 38 @entity13			0
@entity1 's @entity141 in @entity142 , @entity50 , contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 has carried out at least 2 rocket motor tests since april , website says
it cites commercial satellite imagery that shows activity at a launch site
a failed rocket launch by the @entity13 in april scuppered a food aid deal with the @entity10
the academic website sees the possibility of rocket and nuclear tests in 2013
