shrimp crawling around rock chimneys spewing hot water deep in the @entity3 may hold clues to the kinds of life that can thrive in extreme environments on other planets , @entity0 says			0
the shrimp are called @entity10 ( no , we ca n't pronounce it either )			0
they live in clumps on hydrothermal vents 7,500 feet underwater , where temperatures reach 750 degrees @entity16 and it 's very , very dark			1
the water near the vents is cool enough for the shrimp to live in			2
the very hot water spewing from the vents is where their dinner is cooked			0
the shrimp dine on carbohydrates produced by bacteria living inside the vents			1
so what does that have to with space aliens ? if these bacteria can survive in these extreme conditions of @entity35 , maybe it can happen on other worlds , such as @entity38 's @entity37 , which has a subsurface ocean			1
" for two - thirds of the @entity35 's history , life has existed only as microbial life , " said @entity40 , senior research scientist at @entity0 's @entity41			1
" on @entity47 , the best chance for life would be microbial			0
" " whether an animal like this could exist on @entity47 heavily depends on the actual amount of energy that 's released there , through hydrothermal vents , " said @entity48 , a postdoctoral fellow at @entity41			1
the elusive @entity55 is finally ready for its closeup so the shrimp eat stuff cranked out by the bacteria -- but what do the bacteria eat ? @entity62 say they get their energy by using chemical reactions ; since hydrogen sulfide is abundant in the vents , they use it to make organic matter			2
what happens to the shrimp when they ca n't find any bacteria to produce carbs for them ? they turn into carnivores , maybe even cannibals			0
researchers say they found bits of crustaceans in the shrimps ' guts and guess which crustacean is in big supply in the area ? @entity87 hybisae			0

shrimp dine on carbohydrates produced by bacteria living inside underwater *volcanic* vents
if bacteria can survive in these conditions on @entity35 , maybe it can happen on other worlds
@entity38 's *icy* moon of @entity47 is the subject of speculation
