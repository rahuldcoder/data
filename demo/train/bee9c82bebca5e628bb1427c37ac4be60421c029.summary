@entity0 -- recent announcements of @entity6 military deployments in response to belligerent statements by @entity9 may have contributed to escalating tensions between the two countries , @entity3 officials told @entity1 on thursday in explaining an effort to reduce @entity6 rhetoric about the reclusive state			1
" we accused the @entity9 of amping things up , now we are worried we did the same thing , " one @entity3 official said			1
they spoke on the same day a @entity6 official first told @entity1 that communications intercepts indicated @entity9 may be planning to launch a mobile ballistic missile in the coming days or weeks			1
classified images and communications intercepts show that @entity9 has moved up to two mobile missiles , launchers and fuel tanks to its @entity30 , another @entity6 official with knowledge of the matter told @entity1			1
@entity32 defense minister @entity31 told a parliamentary committee in @entity34 that the activity signaled an imminent test firing or military drill , according to the semi-official @entity32 news agency @entity38			0
amid @entity41 bluster , missile launch feared one @entity6 official said it is believed any launch this time would be a test			1
the activity is consistent with a @entity50 missile , the official said			2
the @entity50 is based on a @entity52 - era system and has a 2,500 - mile ( 4,000 - kilometer ) range that can threaten @entity32 , @entity54 and @entity55 , but not @entity6 forces based on @entity57			2
as a vital ally to @entity32 since the @entity32 war in the 1950s , the @entity6 has pledged military backing to @entity34 in the event of an attack by @entity9			1
in addition , @entity9 has been developing nuclear weapons technology , raising concerns of rapid proliferation in the region and even a possible nuclear strike by @entity41			1
the fraught situation on the @entity70 stems from the @entity9 's latest long - range rocket launch in december and underground nuclear test in february			1
in response , the @entity6 helped bring tougher @entity75 sanctions on @entity9 and took part in joint military exercises with @entity32 , prompting @entity79 's government to ratchet up its threats in recent weeks			1
that caused the @entity6 to display its military strength in the annual drills taking place now , flying @entity86 stealth bombers capable of carrying conventional or nuclear weapons , as well as @entity89 - era @entity88 and @entity91 stealth fighters over @entity32			2
@entity9 : our global fear and fascination on thursday , a @entity9 army official warned that " the moment of explosion is approaching fast			1
" " no one can say a war will break out in @entity9 or not and whether it will break out today or tomorrow , " said the spokesman for the general staff of the @entity9 's @entity100 ( @entity100 )			2
" the responsibility for this grave situation entirely rests with the @entity6 administration and military warmongers keen to encroach upon the @entity9 's sovereignty and bring down its dignified social system with brigandish logic , " the @entity100 spokesman added in a statement published by the state - run @entity105 ( @entity105 )			1
a spokeswoman for the @entity114 said thursday that the @entity6 continues to closely monitor the situation			2
" threats and provocative actions will not bring @entity9 the security , international respect , and economic development it seeks , " said the @entity117 spokeswoman , @entity116			1
" we will continue to urge the @entity9 leadership to heed president @entity126 's call to choose the path of peace and come into compliance with its international obligations			2
" earlier , a @entity3 official told @entity1 that from a communications point of view , " we are trying to turn the volume down " on @entity6 rhetoric about @entity9			1
the official , speaking on condition of not being identified , said the change referred to public statements by the @entity126 administration instead of how @entity6 military hardware were being deployed in the region			1
according to the official , some @entity3 officials were surprised at how @entity6 news releases and statements on @entity9 were generating world headlines and therefore provoking a @entity41 response			1
" we are absolutely trying to ratchet back the rhetoric , " the official said			0
" we become part of the cycle			0
we allowed that to happen			0
" key dates in @entity6 military moves near @entity9 at the @entity155 , spokeswoman @entity154 said thursday the @entity6 needed to take the defensive steps it did in view of @entity9 's threats , but she focused on a diplomatic solution available if @entity41 changed its behavior			1
" it was the ratcheting up of tensions on the @entity9 side that caused us to need to shore up our own defense posture			2
we have done that , " @entity154 said			0
" but we have also been saying all the way through that this does not need to get hotter , that we can change course here if the @entity9 will begin to come back into compliance with its international obligations , will begin to cool things down , take a pause			2
" to @entity176 , the former @entity6 ambassador to the @entity75 , the administration 's response so far has been " appropriate -- cool , calm , but at the same time putting our military resources ready in case there 's an emergency			2
" he told @entity1 on thursday that a @entity9 military attack on @entity6 interests would be " suicidal , " adding : " that 's not going to happen			1
" diplomacy should be the " end game " for the administration 's policy regarding @entity9 , said @entity176 , one of the few @entity6 politicians to have visited the country			1
" i think the administration 's response does make sense in the sense that you do n't want to continue this huge rhetoric and at the same time provoke some kind of incident , " @entity176 said			0
" the danger is not a war with the @entity6 or @entity32 , i think			2
the danger is some kind of military altercation in the @entity201 , a naval skirmish of some kind			0
" @entity6 secretary of state @entity204 is expected to travel to @entity32 , @entity205 and @entity54 this month to meet with his counterparts there			2
previously , the @entity126 administration established a " playbook " of pre-scripted actions and responses to the last several weeks of @entity9 rhetoric and provocations , an administration official said thursday			1
the scripted actions included an increased show of @entity6 military force -- such as the flying of @entity86 bombers -- during the annual @entity6 - @entity32 military exercise , the @entity220			2
" eyebrows started to go up when it was clear @entity220 was going to be protected from the budget cuts of sequestration , " the official said , referring to the forced federal spending cuts that went into effect in march			0
the playbook planning began under former defense secretary @entity230 but was picked up and supported strongly by his successor , defense secretary @entity231 , the official said			0
details of the playbook were first reported by the @entity234			0
the administration official declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation			0
opinion : @entity9 is far from suicidal some moves not scripted however , some of the @entity6 military 's reactions to @entity41 's saber - rattling were not part of the playbook planning			1
instead , they arose from concerns about what @entity9 has planned as the @entity6 - @entity32 exercise conclude , the administration official said			1
for example , the deployment of ballistic missile defenses closer to @entity9 and a land - based missile - intercept system to @entity57 were ordered in recent days when @entity6 intelligence began to gather information that @entity9 might be planning additional missile launches			1
a ' complicated , combustible situation ' @entity6 officials have publicly stressed that the @entity6 military moves were also meant to assure the @entity32 that they have @entity0 's full support			1
" what i can tell you is that our response and the mix of assets we have applied to our responses is prudent , logical and measured , " @entity3 spokesman @entity261 said earlier this week			0
" we are in the midst right now of -- of very important annual exercises that we regularly conduct with the @entity32 , and these exercises are about alliance assurance			0
they 're first and foremost about showing the @entity32 and showing our other allies in the region , including the @entity54 , that we are ready to defend them in the wake of threats			0
" when asked by @entity1 earlier this week about the " message " the @entity6 was trying to send to @entity9 , @entity261 said it was the @entity9 who are being provocative			1
" the @entity9 -- even before those exercises started -- had undertaken provocative steps , and they 've conducted underground nuclear tests , they 've conducted missile tests outside their international obligations			1
so they have a track record now over the past few months of provocative behavior , " he said			0
" we are in the business of ensuring our @entity32 allies that we will help defend them in the face of threats , " @entity261 said in response			0
" so i do n't think it 's a contradiction			0
i think that @entity9 have engaged in certain actions and have said things that are provocative			2
we are looking for the temperature to be taken down on the @entity70			0
" @entity299 hinted at risks in reacting to @entity9 , calling the tensions a " complicated , combustible situation " that could " explode into a worse situation			0
" " it only takes being wrong once			0
and i do n't want to be the secretary of defense who was wrong once			0
so we will continue to take these threats seriously			0
i hope the @entity306 will ratchet this very dangerous rhetoric down , " @entity299 said wednesday			0
" but they 've got to be a responsible member of the world community			0
and you do n't achieve that responsibility and peace and prosperity by making nuclear threats and taking very provocative actions			0
" @entity1 's @entity317 , @entity318 , @entity319 , @entity320 and @entity321 contributed to this report			0
