since the closing of what was the world 's best restaurant for many years , life has been busy for @entity4			1
known as the not - so - secret secret weapon behind the imaginative , acclaimed @entity6 on the @entity8 coast in @entity9 , the younger @entity11 brother was the creator of many of the restaurant 's deconstructivist dishes that haunted the ambitions of young chefs around the world			1
it 's difficult to overstate the influence of his work at @entity6 under the leadership of his older brother @entity23			1
" picture an armada without a flagship , a solar system without a sun , and that is what high - end @entity34 cuisine will look like in the absence of @entity6 , " was how the @entity25 mourned the 2011 closing of " the world 's most influential restaurant			1
" coming out of the kitchen shadows in the years since , @entity11 is generating buzz and critical acclaim with the whimsical bars and restaurants he has opened in @entity43 -- cocktail bar @entity44 , tapas bar tickets , @entity50 - @entity49 restaurant @entity47 and @entity51 , a casual vermouth bar			1
@entity53 highlighted him as " @entity55 " in the magazine 's roundup of the most influential people in the gastronomy world			1
in november , he received a @entity61 star for tickets and another one for @entity63			1
we caught up with the starred chef in @entity66 as he prepared for a special dinner featuring his iconic dishes at @entity69			1
@entity70 : could you talk a little about why @entity6 closed ? if profitability was an issue , as it has been reported , then why were the dishes not priced higher , given the massive popularity ? @entity4 : my brother had been there 25 years and i had been there 23 years and we came to a conclusion together that it was the best idea to leave it when it was at its top			1
we were getting older and working for 16 hours a day was getting unsustainable			0
the problem was n't the economic side -- that it was never an issue			0
the problem with this kind of restaurant is the physical and mental exhaustion			1
so we had to give it a break			0
@entity70 : your new five restaurants ( he has another one in the works in addition to the four already open ) are not as exhausting ? @entity4 : it 's as if i made @entity102 before , and now i make @entity103			1
quality , but different quality			0
@entity70 : what are the price points for these new projects ? @entity4 : tickets are around € 80 ( $ 109 ) per head , 41º experience has two concepts -- you can go there and have cocktails -- around € 12 ( $ 16 ) each -- and snacks , or a closed menu which is € 200 ( $ 273 )			1
at @entity119 , the price is € 130 ( $ 177 ) and @entity120 is € 40 ( $ 55 )			0
my next venture @entity123 , a @entity125 restaurant , will be € 50 ( $ 68 ) at the bar and € 80 - € 90 ( $ 109 - $ 122 ) at the restaurant			1
the restaurants with higher pricing have less capacity			1
@entity70 : are people getting fed up with designer food ? @entity4 : no , absolutely not			1
it became popular and a lot of these kinds of restaurants opened but there were still very few very good restaurants			1
the question is never which style of cuisine is in fashion or not			0
there are only two kinds of cuisines -- good or bad			0
and the good always wins			0
these days , i like to go to small but very good restaurants			2
thanks to high gastronomy training -- at @entity6 for example -- a lot of young cooks are ready to make unbelievable things			1
those in their 20s and 30s have a technical capacity that is unbelievable			0
in @entity9 , for example , and anywhere really , you can eat very well because of these hundreds of young chefs who have trained with the greats			0
all of these young chefs have adapted to the crisis and they have started to make all of these little restaurants with a different type of kitchen but one that is very , very good			2
@entity70 : do people taking photos of your food ever make you angry ? @entity4 : it 's a reality that people take pictures of all the dishes			1
there 's a good side and a bad side			2
obviously , the good side is that they are promoting your dishes , the bad side is that many of the photos are very bad			0
at 41º experience for example , the element of surprise is very important but if you type 41º on the @entity189 , you can see all the menus , which spoils the surprise and is very bad for me			0
at 41º , the creativity is so important			0
the restaurant only seats 16 , but we have 20 people working there			2
@entity70 : are tapas becoming too cliche ? @entity4 : the concept of tapas is actually a rather difficult one to explain so it 's difficult to export the concept to certain countries			1
in @entity207 , the concept of sharing is similar so it 's gone down very well , but as for whether it is cliche , it is not really			2
as with any type of restaurants , you just have good tapas restaurants and bad tapas restaurants			2
the good ones do very well			0
and the quality depends on the quality of the products			0
the best restaurants uses the best quality products , that is clear			2
even when making a pizza , it 's important to use the best flour , even the water is important			2
you must use the best water			0
the industry is ready to make a lot better products but the problem is that the people are not ready to pay extra for the better product			0
@entity70 : what do you think of the @entity61 star ratings ? @entity4 : guides are always good if you are at the top			1
the game has changed a lot since these paper guides started , and the information the customers are receiving changes very quickly these days			0
on @entity246 for example , there are a thousand comments and you do n't know who these people are , whether their opinions can be trusted			0
at the end of the day there 's a lot more information these days but it 's very unreliable			2
there 's a saying in @entity9 that it 's better that people talk about you , even if it 's bad			2
i do n't agree with that			0
it should not be about a lot of information , if should be about who is giving the information , and whether it is reliable or non reliable			0
another thing , i received two @entity61 stars last year , but this did not change anything at my restaurant in terms of reservations			1
in years past , at @entity6 when we were given three @entity61 stars , we became flooded with reservations			1
but now you do n't see that and that is reference to how the world of guides has changed			0
@entity70 : do you ever just have a steak ? @entity4 : usually i do n't eat much			1
in the morning , i make myself a good shake that has everything i need , and throughout the day i have to go try all the food from the restaurants so i do n't ever sit down and eat something like a steak			2
all chefs have this way of life			0
@entity70 : what is your perfect day off ? every day is the best day of my life			0
i 'm happy just where i am			0
so it 's hard to think of what i would do on a day off			2
with five restaurants i am so busy , so it 's important to surround myself with a good group of people who make me laugh and happy every day			1
otherwise i would go crazy			0
@entity70 : who is the best cook in your family ? @entity4 : my mother !			1

@entity6 's @entity4 has opened four restaurants in @entity43
the chef won @entity61 stars for two of his new restaurants in november
his fifth project of the moment will be the launch of a @entity125 restaurant
