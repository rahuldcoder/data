@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 bounds up the stairs , down the stairs , over the hurdles , through the tunnel and stops			1
he cautiously sidesteps the large white ring in front of him and sits down			1
@entity11 tries to tease her @entity13 @entity12 named @entity14 with a feather			1
" through the ring ! come on , @entity3 , through the ring ! " his owner encourages , as she enthusiastically jingles a feathered toy on the other side of the obstacle			2
@entity3 glances over , clearly saying , " there is no way i am jumping through that hoop			2
" and anyone watching -- anyone who has ever owned a cat -- knows he is right			2
" it can be frustrating , " @entity26 says from the sidelines of the agility course			1
" but it 's a challenge , a new dimension to showing			2
" @entity32 is the owner of @entity33 , one of the nation 's top agility cats			1
dressed to impress , @entity32 looks more like a business executive than a cat fanatic -- but the breeder of @entity40 cats has more than 20 years experience in pedigree showing			1
" some people like to go to the golf course on the weekend			2
i like to go to a cat show , " she says with a smile			1
this time around , it was last weekend 's @entity50 's @entity49 , in @entity0 , @entity1 -- touted as the @entity52 's largest cat show , with 729 cats from 41 breeds and 14 countries			1
elaborately decorated cages fill both sides and the back of the convention center floor			2
vendors sell everything from cat hammocks to gutter guards ( even the show manager is n't sure why gutter guards are there ) , and a man in a wig shows off his tightrope - walking cats			1
but arguably the most important activity takes place just past the garbage cans marked " dump litter here , please			2
" judging @entity74 carries @entity75 -- short for @entity75 of @entity76 -- two - handed under her belly , stretching her out to her full length as they walk to one of the 12 judging rings			2
" [ we do this ] to show her off to the crowd and to avoid handprints on her fur , " he says			1
@entity75 's judge wipes down his table with disinfectant and then picks up @entity75 , staring into her eyes as her feet dangle four feet above the ground			2
he puts her down and proceeds to feel her coat and check her response time			1
at one point , she tries to escape from the table , but is nabbed by the quick - handed judge			2
the whole thing is over less than a minute later			2
each cat is judged by six judges throughout the weekend , show manager @entity100 says			1
the cats are split into three groups : kittens ( less than 8 months ) , champions ( adult cats ) , and premiers ( adult neutered / spayed cats )			1
these categories are broken down again by breed , color and sex			0
on sunday morning , judges tally up the points and select the top two cats from each category			1
a panel then picks the best in show			1
" that 's it in a nutshell , " @entity100 says			0
of course , it 's slightly more complicated			0
each judge must train for six years			0
they must know the standards for each breed -- written descriptions of the " ideal " cat -- and be able to tell which @entity131 has the perfect ear width or which red cat has the best color			0
time and money the ideal breed standard is impossible to reach , @entity100 says , but owners spend hundreds of hours , and dollars , trying			1
that 's most evident when an announcement comes over the loudspeaker for a dna " blue - eyed " breeding seminar , starting in one hour			0
@entity74 and his wife , @entity144 , attend approximately 30 cat shows each year			0
the couple arrived in @entity0 with @entity75 and @entity147 on thursday night after a 12 - hour drive from @entity149 , @entity150			1
between gas , hotel rooms , entrance fees and cat supplies , @entity74 estimates the shows cost him between a couple hundred and $ 1,000 per month			0
of course , showing cats is a lot cheaper than showing horses -- as @entity11 is quick to point out			1
she and her husband @entity160 showed horses for many years before switching to @entity162			0
the couple has 11 @entity12 , all of which need regular baths if they 're showing			0
each bath takes @entity11 an hour and a half to two hours , including a blow dry			0
so how much time does the average owner spend grooming their cats ? " just depends on how many you have and how well you take care of them , " she says			1
" you 've got to keep them healthy and happy			0
" for the love of it back in the ring , @entity33 is running @entity32 ragged			0
he zooms through the other obstacles , only to stop short at the blue weave bars			0
once , twice , three times he stops , before @entity32 sighs , wiping her forehead with her arm			0
" i think we 're tired , " she says			0
" bored , not tired , " agility instructor @entity189 calls out to @entity32			1
" [ @entity33 ] could do this all night			0
keep your body ahead [ of the cat ] and make a wide sweep with your arm			0
" @entity32 goes to scoop up @entity33 , only to miss the rascal by inches			0
this starts a game of chase that ends with @entity33 in a red carrier and @entity32 laughing			0
putting on a show this large takes more than a year , and it 's scenes like this one that convince @entity100 her hard work is worth it			1
she says most of the people who come to shows are there simply because they love animals			0
" there 's the best of all things , " she says , speaking loudly over the call for @entity216 cats in ring three			1
" at night , when you go home you have this warm , fuzzy , cuddly animal that adores you and you adore him or her			0
i mean , how could you ask for anything better ? "			0
