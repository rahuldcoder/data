@entity0 -- just when you thought the nation 's entertainment capital could n't deliver a new surprise ending , a camera - wielding resident reveals how this week 's @entity8 storm sent @entity0 a tornado			1
the rare twister was captured on tape : roofs obliterated , shingles hurled like leaves , and the amateur videographer gasping in profane disbelief			2
friday 's melee even damaged the steel of a billboard			2
it was crazy , " @entity21 told @entity1 affiliate @entity22 after shooting a video of bent - over palm trees and his rooftop flying off			0
" i am shaken up			0
" before friday , the last time a twister made big news in @entity0 was 1983 , slamming into the downtown @entity29 , though there have been a few tornadoes since then around the area			1
" they are pretty rare , but not as rare as you might think , though , " said @entity34 meteorologist @entity33 of the @entity0 - @entity36 office			1
@entity0 has n't seen a tornado for the past few years , but a study in the 1990s showed that " the amount of tornadoes we get in the @entity45 basin is comparable to what they get in the @entity48 but it 's much weaker , " @entity33 said			1
" most of the ones we get out here are @entity51 's , whereas out in the @entity48 , they get the @entity51 's and larger , " @entity33 said			2
on a tornado damage scale , an @entity51 is the weakest , with three - second gusts between 65 and 85 mph , according to the service			1
the worst of tornadoes is ranked @entity51 , with the winds exceeding 200 mph			2
an @entity51 has such gusts between 136 and 165 mph			0
that means friday morning 's twister in south @entity0 struck with winds between 65 mph and 85 mph , ripping two residential roofs and knocking over trees , the service said			1
the tornado was born out of a @entity8 storm that pummeled much of the coast from wednesday to friday			0
what to know about tornadoes more tornadoes ahead ? one of the more memorable tornado seasons in @entity0 was the 1997 - 1998 winter when a strong @entity73 o weather phenomenon brought several storms and weak twisters , @entity33 said			1
an @entity77 ± o event involves the warming of the central and eastern @entity8 and influences the jet stream where storms track			1
" we might be going into a weak @entity83 o this year , but it does n't tell us how wet of a year we 're going to have or how many storms we 're going to have , " @entity33 said			1
more rain will fall on @entity87 beginning late sunday , and @entity0 may received a quarter - to a half - inch of rain on monday , with a chance of showers through the week , @entity33 said			1
rain resumes next week but next week 's rainfall should n't cause the kind of disasters seen this past week , @entity33 said			1
at a minimum , those rains will help slake a historic drought that 's been drying up @entity87 the past three years			1
" it does n't look like it 's going to be a major deal , more of a beneficial rain , " @entity33 said of next week 's forecast			1
the recent storms flooded and ravaged the @entity103 : homes fell into the sea in @entity106 , @entity107 ; schools closed pre-emptively in @entity109 and @entity110 ; a landslide buried houses in @entity113 ; and a long balcony of second - floor apartments collapsed upon ground - level storefronts in @entity117			0
no one in @entity87 was killed , but falling trees killed two people in @entity122 and left a third seriously injured , authorities said			2
now comes the cleanup on saturday , @entity87 experienced lingering damage and sporadic power outages , but for the most part , the state had recovered , said @entity129 , deputy director of the @entity130			1
" widespread outages are pretty much gone , " @entity129 said saturday			0
" what we 're seeing is the cleanup part of the process for us			0
" it was a bad storm for us , " @entity129 said			0
" luckily , we did n't suffer as many of the impacts as we thought we might have			0
" @entity87 rescuers saved people trapped in a mobile home park , in the @entity141 and a few other spots			2
@entity143 got the worst of the storm thursday , as evidenced by swaying @entity147 bridges , halted ferry and cable car services around @entity109 and blizzard - like conditions in the @entity152 mountains			0
on friday , it was more @entity87 's turn			1
several spots in the region had record rainfall for the day , including 2.36 inches in @entity36 and 1.54 inches at @entity117 's airport			0
a storm like this -- the biggest to hit the area in years -- leaves a big mess behind , from flooded roadways to damaged houses to lives disrupted or turned entirely upside down			0
thankfully , in @entity87 at least , the vast majority of the once 300,000 customers left in the dark now have their power back on			2
and @entity129 said that , as bad as this storm was , " it was not quite as bad as we expected			0
" even then , there 's still a lot to do saturday to get things back to normal			0
but this time , at least , @entity176 should cooperate			0
" we 're looking pretty good , " @entity129 told @entity1			0
" we 're hoping for some sunshine today here in @entity87 , and that will ( help in ) the cleanup process going on in several parts of the state			2

new : tornadoes are rare in @entity0 but not as scarce as you think , meteorologist says
new : when twisters do strike @entity45 , they are *typically* the weakest grade
new : it 's *unclear* whether @entity195 event will bring storms strong enough for more tornadoes
new : more rain will fall upon @entity87 next week , but major damage is n't expected
