@entity0 -- on a typical day in @entity0 , @entity2 delivers fruit and vegetables with his cart and trusty burro to the neighborhoods of @entity8 and @entity9			1
today , he 's carrying the most precious cargo of all			1
the only thing @entity2 could fit on his wooden cart is his family			1
thirteen people hold on as the donkey moves down the road : @entity2 , his wife , sister and 10 small children with untamed , sun - kissed hair			1
asked if they are afraid , the 31 - year - old @entity2 says , " we feel we are already dead			1
" his youngsters are smiling , seamlessly unaware of the danger they 're in , which is a sharp contrast to their mother 's red , shell - shocked eyes of reality			1
they tell us they left their home just an hour ago			2
the previous night automated calls from the @entity34 military and leaflets dropped by the @entity34 @entity36 on these neighborhoods located in the east warned of impending bombings to begin at 9 a.m. the following day			1
the war between @entity34 and @entity0 militants is entering its 10th day			1
their donkey strains against the weight of the load as they move to their final destination , a @entity49 - run school that has been turned into temporary shelter and , more importantly , safety			1
growing toll of kids killed in @entity0 for many @entity54 , the search for safety means packing whatever they can into cars , buses and trucks to flee the impending bombings			1
almost like clockwork plumes of black smokes billow above @entity8			2
the neighborhood 's main market is closed			2
almost all the stores have their metal shutters down and padlocks clasped tight			2
typically those shops would be bustling as families prepare to break the fast during the @entity70 holy month of @entity71			2
scrambling in the shadow of the explosions , mothers and fathers are looking for alternative places to buy last - minute items for their children			2
fifty - five - year - old @entity79 walks quickly down the sidewalk carrying bags of fruits and vegetables			2
the sweat on her brow mixes with the tears in her eyes			2
" what can i do ? " she asks			2
" we ran out of food so i had to leave my daughter - in - law to take care of the kids			1
" trapped in war : ' this is tyranny ' @entity96 left her two girls at home , crying , to buy food and medicine			0
" the @entity34 told us to leave our home by leaflets and phone calls but i have nowhere to go ... we will not leave , it is our destiny , " she says			1
then there is @entity108 who cracks a smile of relief			0
he just finished evacuating 20 members of his family from their home			0
" we are fed up with this frightening situation but at the same time we need them to open the border so we can work and feed our families , " the 57 - year - old says			0
many people we talk to despise the war but their anger is eclipsed only by @entity0 's current state of affairs			1
for that , they blame @entity34 @entity0 has been called the world 's largest open - air prison			1
it 's been like that since @entity130 took control of it back in 2007			0
the only real exit for @entity54 is the @entity134 border crossing with @entity135 , which is rarely open			0
importing items from @entity34 is heavily restricted , so is access to the sea			1
racing toward danger : war - scarred @entity0 medical crews also in harm 's way at the @entity49 - run school are scores of refugees who 've fled their neighborhoods			1
there is a sense of security within the blue and white walls of the compound			0
here we find a crowd surrounding a lady crying hysterically			0
between the tears , @entity155 tells us how she returned to her house just as the sun illuminated the concrete structure demolished			0
two plastic bags carry all the possessions she could salvage			0
she screams , thanking @entity162 she left the previous day			0
but despair sets in for the mother of three			0
" where will i go ? " she asks			0
" i have nothing left			0
" later at the same school , @entity2 is in his new accommodations , a fourth - floor classroom			0
his ride is left with the other donkeys and horses tied up at the main gate			0
he is settling in with his new neighbors			0
his children are still smiling , this time because they have new playmates			0
app alerts @entity34 of incoming rocket fire			1

life for many in @entity0 means a search for safety from bombs
they pack whatever they can into cars , buses and trucks and onto carts , and they flee
others refuse to evacuate despite warnings from @entity34
says one woman , " i have nowhere to go ... we will not leave , it is our destiny "
