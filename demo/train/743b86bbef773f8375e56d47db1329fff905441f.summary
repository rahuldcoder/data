the prince spoke at a meeting of @entity15 , a body bringing together his royal foundation and the world 's leading wildlife charities , in @entity0			1
the conference is part of a week of events aimed at galvanizing efforts to halt the slaughter of endangered animals for their bones , hides or tusks -- much in demand in parts of @entity30			2
on thursday , @entity2 and his father , prince @entity31 , will be among the high - profile global guests due to attend the @entity34 on the @entity35 , hosted by the @entity3 government			1
prince @entity31 , @entity3 prime minister @entity37 and the presidents of @entity39 and @entity40 are all expected to speak at the event			0
@entity2 pledged wednesday that @entity42 , of which he 's president , would use its global leverage to make a difference at a time when the trade takes the lives of 100 elephants a day			1
" the forces that are currently destroying some of the world 's endangered species are sophisticated and powerful , " the @entity49 said			1
" but this week , we are seeing the creation of an equally powerful alliance , coming together to help fight them			0
" the commitments set out today will begin to address the challenges of protection , enforcement and demand reduction			0
we will use our combined resources to ensure they succeed			0
" the organization plans to use " smart " technology such as @entity67 trackers and drones to protect animals at risk			0
it also intends to work with governments and local bodies to send out the message that no one should trade or buy rhino horn , ivory , tiger or pangolin parts and products			0
@entity42 will also bolster efforts to bring those involved in the illegal wildlife trade to justice and to support local communities whose livelihoods are affected by the trade , it said			1
estimate : @entity90 killed every 11 hours the call to action comes in the face of horrifying statistics			0
more than 10 % of the total african elephant population has been slaughtered for ivory in two years , according to the @entity96 , which calls it " a death toll the species simply can not sustain			0
" since the turn of this century , more than 1,000 tigers have been poached -- a huge number considering there are thought to be no more than 3,500 left in the wild			2
the rate of rhino poaching in @entity107 reportedly increased by 43 % between 2011 and 2012 and is still going up			0
since 2013 , a rhino is estimated to have been killed every 11 hours by poachers , the @entity96 says			0
@entity111 president @entity110 signed off tuesday on a " @entity112 , " which sets out ways to stem the illegal trade			2
its stated priorities are to strengthen enforcement , reduce demand for illegally trafficked wildlife and work more closely with international partners			0
" wildlife trafficking is both a critical conservation concern and a threat to global security with significant effects on the national interests of the @entity111 and the interests of our partners around the world , " the document says			1
it acknowledges the @entity111 is " among the world 's major markets for wildlife and wildlife products , both legal and illegal " but also points to demand for ivory and rhino horn in @entity30 , " from a rapidly expanding wealthy class that views these commodities as luxury goods that enhance social status			1
" ' if we fail , it will be too late ' @entity2 and @entity31 released an unusual joint video message sunday that urged people worldwide to take a stand			2
but @entity2 , who has been a patron since 2005 of the wildlife conservation charity @entity148 , faced criticism saturday in @entity3 newspaper @entity150 for reportedly going on a boar hunting trip to @entity152 with his brother , prince @entity153			1
wild boar are legally hunted in the country , but the timing of the trip raised questions , it said			0
" prince @entity2 has gone shooting -- a day before launching a campaign to stop wildlife being killed , " the popular tabloid said			1
in the joint video , recorded in november , @entity31 said it was time to treat the effort to stop the illegal wildlife trade " like a battle , because it is precisely that			1
" he pointed to the sophisticated weaponry used by poachers and the threat that such criminal activity poses to economic and social stability in the countries affected			0
@entity2 said that he and his father were optimistic the " tide can be reversed			2
" " we have to be the generation that stopped the illegal wildlife trade , and secured the future of these magnificent animals , and their habitats , for if we fail , it will be too late , " the younger prince adds			1
@entity2 , whose wife @entity189 gave birth to their son @entity191 last summer , said that since becoming a father , he has become " even more devoted to protecting the resources of the @entity195 for not only my own son but also the other children of his generation to enjoy			2
" the video , which was recorded in november , ends with the pair saying the phrase " let 's unite for wildlife ! " in @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity152 and @entity207			2
the aim is to be understood by as many people as possible living in the countries most affected by the illegal wildlife trade			1
