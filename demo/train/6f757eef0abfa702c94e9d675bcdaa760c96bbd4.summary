-- young people around the world love their cell phones -- and a new @entity5 report sheds light on which phones they 're using , how they choose their phones , and how they use them			1
the report focused on youth ages 15 - 24 from @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , the @entity20 and the @entity21 some highlights : in all countries studied , the majority of young mobile users own feature phones ( basic phones that do n't run apps ) -- which is n't surprising , since they indicated that price is the main driver in their purchase decision ( except for @entity13 , where design was ranked as slightly more important )			1
in the @entity21 , only 33 % of young mobile users have smartphones			1
@entity19 had the highest smartphone penetration among youth ( 47 % ) , and @entity14 had the lowest ( 10 % )			0
one surprise : most young @entity21 smartphone users ( 55 % ) are female			0
in every other country studied , most young smartphone users are male			2
across all types of phones , @entity15 and the @entity21 have the most young users who use advanced mobile data services			2
" 84 % percent of @entity15 youth use their phones beyond voice and text , compared to 47 percent of @entity15 adults			2
meanwhile : " 83 % of @entity21 youth use advanced data -- 32 % higher than @entity21 adults			0
" but in terms of mobile web usage , @entity15 youth are leading the way : 73 % of young @entity15 mobile users access the web from their phone			1
young @entity21 mobile users , while in second place , are far behind -- only 48 % report using the mobile web			2
the report took a special look at @entity21 teen texting			0
" if it seems like @entity21 teens [ ages 13 - 17 ] are texting all the time , it 's probably because on average they 're sending or receiving 3,339 texts a month			0
that 's more than six per hour they 're awake -- an 8 % jump from last year , " said the report			0
teen girls are doing most of that texting , the report said -- they send and receive an average of 4,050 texts per month			0
who pays for young people 's cell phones ? this varies by age			0
in the @entity21 , only 27 % of mobile users aged 15 - 19 pay for their own service ; in @entity17 and @entity12 , that figure is 56 %			1
but once @entity17 and @entity12 mobile users reach the 20 - 24 age group , those numbers jump to 84 % and 82 % , respectively			1
for @entity21 mobile users aged 20 - 24 , 45 % are paying their own mobile phone bills			1
which is a bit surprising : are most @entity21 families really willing to foot the mobile bill for a 24 - year - old ? how do young people pay for their phones ? in @entity13 , a whopping 98 % of young mobile users have prepaid phone plans ; in the @entity21 , only 19 % do			1
however , prepaid plans are more common and diverse in most countries outside the @entity21 ; so this might not be solely an age - related issue .			0
