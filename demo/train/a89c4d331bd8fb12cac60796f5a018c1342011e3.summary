-- there i was , having an epiphany			2
i had just run close to 3 miles with my 24 - year - old son , and wishing i had been in better shape to enjoy more activities with my kids when they were younger			1
why did i wait so long to get healthier ? how much did i miss out on by not taking the time to take care of myself ? training for a triathlon has made me aware of the side benefits of exercise -- benefits that expand past the point of gaining strength and losing fat			1
i have never been particularly goal - driven ; i seemed to thrive by getting through life " by the seat of my pants			2
" but this year i have realized the benefit of having goals , both large and small , and of working to achieve those goals			2
what a motivation boost it is to see how much progress i have made , especially in my running			2
when i first started running in january , i could n't make a half - lap around a high school track without getting winded			2
yesterday , after bike riding for almost an hour and a half , i was able to run over two miles in 30 minutes			2
there is no way i would have been able to progress to that point without goals and coaching			0
this side benefit has bled into my professional life			0
by setting small goals , i feel that i am better able to focus on tasks and am more efficient with the demands of my workday			0
my ability to do athletic activities other than the three triathlon sports has improved as well , telling me that my overall fitness and coordination have improved			1
my job in the hospital can involve a great deal of walking , lifting and twisting			1
i can now work a 12 - hour shift and finish with more energy than i would have before i started training			1
that dying patient could have been me my wife has gotten into biking and running with me			0
we both agreed that whatever happens , we can not stop what we are doing after the triathlon			1
not only do we not want to lose our momentum , we both have enjoyed the journey , supporting and encouraging each other along the way			1
even my golf swing feels better ( though anything would have been an improvement ! ) i am turning 50 in july , but i do n't feel 50			0
other than the occasional soreness that comes after a workout , i do n't have the aches and pains of middle age			0
i sleep so much better than i did years ago			0
some have told me that i do n't look like i am that old -- what a shot of confidence that gives me ! since beginning training , i do n't feel irritable toward the world ; i actually enjoy each day as it comes			1
it has been a long time since i have felt depressed or discouraged			0
before you call me @entity80 , know that i am not always the happy - go - lucky guy i would like to be every second of the day			0
but i do think that because i am exercising my body , my mind benefits as well			1
the negatives of life can be met with a better attitude and fresh perspective			0
how we approach the events of life often determine their outcome			0
if i come to a bump in the road grumpy , sluggish and depressed , how much more severe is that bump going to be ? i have come to realize that life is too short to needlessly suffer the consequences of inactivity and procrastination			0
get out there and do something -- something you enjoy			0
give yourself the gift of a better day by making an effort to strengthen your body and improve your mind			1
you are fearfully and wonderfully made ; take advantage of that and follow me and the rest of @entity108 as we work to live the second half of our lives better than the first			1
