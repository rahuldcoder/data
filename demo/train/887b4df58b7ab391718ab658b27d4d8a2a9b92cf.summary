@entity0 , @entity1 -- a short ferry ride away from @entity4 , lies the quiet and picturesque @entity0			1
three kilometers off the coast , the @entity1 island is tiny and easily accessible by foot			1
without cars or roads , the island preserves a charming ambiance with faded buildings revealing its @entity14 colonial history			1
beneath its quaint facade , however , the island hides a brutal history			1
known as @entity18 at the time and located at the westernmost point in @entity21 , @entity0 used to serve as a strategic trading post for the transatlantic slave trade -- @entity25 men , women and children were held and traded here before being loaded onto ships to the @entity29			1
estimates vary , but all of them place the number of @entity25 who died while in transit in the millions			2
@entity36 has worked on the island for 26 years as a site manager			2
he is also the chief curator of the " @entity39 , " built by the @entity40 in 1776 , and is the last slave house remaining on the island and @entity43 has painstakingly preserved its history			1

today most have disappeared and turned into private houses , " @entity36 told @entity2 during a tour of the house			2
" this one was chosen by the @entity1 state to keep the memory and remind all the people about the fragility of the liberties			1
people come from different countries ... it 's a place of memory and reconciliation			0
" on the ground floor of the house is the men 's quarters where male slaves were housed in a row of cement cells			0
according to @entity36 , about 15 - 20 male slaves were packed in these 2.6 meter by 2.6 meter rooms ; seated with their backs against the wall , chained around the neck and arms , they would usually have to wait in the room for about three months			0
the conditions were so appalling and unsanitary that a major epidemic that ravaged the island in the 18th century started in these rooms , @entity36 said			2
after the waiting period , the slaves would then be taken out of the cells for trade			0
they were then stripped naked and gathered in the courtyard in the middle of the house			0
the buyers and traders would lean over the balcony overlooking the courtyard and observe the slaves while negotiating prices			0
" each ethnic group used to have a quoted price			0
" said @entity36 , " they were treated exactly as merchandise not as human beings			0

located at the very back of the house , facing the @entity106 , the door leads to a wharf made of palm wood , where there would be a ship waiting to take the @entity25 across the ocean , never to return to their homes			2
slaves that had fallen ill or died were also thrown into the ocean from this door , @entity36 said			0
according to @entity36 , all parts of the house were utilized to facilitate the slave trade : small dark rooms underneath the staircases were used as punishment rooms , and the damp little rooms kept young girls and children separately from men for sale or the pleasure of the traders			1
when asked how he could face the horrors done to his ancestors every day , @entity36 's answer came rather calmly : ' it is important to keep the memory of the victims , to consider that what happened is a part of the history of human being , not only history of @entity25 or blacks or whites			1
