@entity11 and @entity12 arrived back in the @entity4 wednesday morning with former president @entity9 , who flew to @entity8 to negotiate their release after they were sentenced to a labor camp			1
@entity17 said wednesday that his wife , @entity18 , told him through a telephone conversation that the @entity8 were willing to grant the two journalists amnesty if a high - level envoy , such as former president clinton , were willing to travel to @entity23			2
but there was no shortage of envoys ready to travel to @entity8 and negotiate the women 's release			0
some heavyweights were turned down by the @entity8 : former vice president @entity10 , a co-founder of the media outfit the women were working for when they were arrested , and @entity33 gov. @entity32 , a former @entity4 ambassador to the @entity34 whose previous missions to @entity8 included negotiating the release of a detained @entity4			2

according to sources intimately involved with the efforts , sen. @entity50 -- chairman of the @entity51 -- received an official invitation to visit @entity23 to facilitate their release and open a larger dialogue on the nuclear issue after several weeks of quiet direct diplomacy between @entity50 and his aides and @entity8			0
in the end , it was @entity9 whom @entity8 wanted			2
two senior @entity68 administration officials described on background how @entity9 's mission to @entity23 to secure the release of two @entity4 journalists imprisoned by @entity8 evolved			1
officials said that while president @entity68 never spoke directly with the former president about this issue , negotiations were under way within the administration			0
during the weekend of july 24 - 25 , @entity9 spoke with national security adviser gen. @entity79 about his willingness to take on this mission			1
@entity9 ultimately agreed to go on the mission but made it very clear in every communication that this was purely a humanitarian effort			1
@entity9 also wanted to make sure , based on the due diligence of the national security team , that there was a high likelihood of success if he went			1
" we were convinced this would be the result , and based on that we could advise president @entity9 that his trip was going to be successful , " one official said			1
@entity54 spokesman @entity96 said wednesday that " we did our homework ... to make sure that if president @entity9 did take this trip , that we would be able to ... win the freedom for these two			1
" @entity96 said that secretary of state @entity100 also had a role in the mission , adding that " the @entity54 was very involved			0
" more details , he said , will be released			0
administration officials also said it was always made clear by @entity9 and the national security team that this would be a humanitarian mission			1
" we had one goal in mind , which was in the @entity4 interest , which was to seek the release of these two @entity4 @entity4 , " one of the officials said			0

" @entity9 and his team engaged in a 75 - minute meeting with president @entity126 and then had a dinner which lasted a little over two hours			2

asked if the nuclear issue at least was discussed , the official said , " i do n't have an answer to that question			0
i 'm sure president @entity9 gave president @entity126 his views on denuclearization and his views are well known with respect to denuclearization			2
" while @entity10 was turned down by @entity8 , he was , however , actively involved in this effort from the start , speaking often with the families and the @entity68 administration			2
on wednesday , @entity68 thanked the former vice president , saying he " worked tirelessly in order to achieve a positive outcome			0
" @entity9 's humanitarian help was not lost on @entity68 -- who reached out to the journalists ' families on tuesday night			2
" i want to thank president @entity9 -- i had a chance to talk to him -- for the extraordinary humanitarian effort that resulted in the release of the two journalists , " he said at the @entity53			1
