-- a former death row chef says he will pay for and cook every last meal for condemned inmates himself , after @entity4 announced it was stopping the tradition			1
" we should not get rid of the last meal , " said @entity6 , an ex-convict who spent a decade in @entity4 preparing last meals for the condemned			1
" justice is going to be served when this person is executed , but can we not show our softer side ? our compassionate side ? " last week 's audacious last meal request by killer @entity15 was the last straw for some in @entity4			1
@entity15 was executed september 21 for his role in the infamous racially motivated 1998 dragging death of @entity20 his last meal request was for two chicken - fried steaks smothered in gravy with sliced onions , a triple - meat bacon cheeseburger , a cheese omelet with other ingredients , a large bowl of fried okra with ketchup , three fajitas , a pint of @entity34 ice cream and a pound of barbecue with a half - loaf of white bread			2
just for good measure , @entity15 added a slab of peanut butter fudge with crushed peanuts , a pizza and three root beers			0
then he ate none of it			0
" enough is enough , " said @entity4 state sen. @entity48 , a day after the execution			2
" it is extremely inappropriate to give a person sentenced to death such a privilege -- one which the perpetrator did not provide to their victim			0
" @entity4 prison officials agreed with @entity48 , immediately halting the tradition of letting an inmate about to be executed choose the menu for his or her last meal			1
" @entity4 has always been coldhearted about these type of things , " said @entity6			1
" not to minimize these crimes , the majority of them have earned their place at that dinner table			0
but with my offer it would not cost @entity4 taxpayers anything			2
" @entity6 said he knows all too well the angst some in @entity4 may feel about baking cakes or grilling steaks for the perpetrators of some of the most heinous crimes in the state			1
@entity6 dealt with the same feelings years ago during a 14 - year prison term for assault			1
his job in the facility included cooking meals to fill the sometimes extravagant requests of men who were about to be executed			0
" i used to research the crimes and wonder , ' how could i prepare a meal for this guy ? ' " @entity6 said			2
@entity6 had little empathy for the convicts on death row until he had a conversation with @entity99 , an inmate who was tasked with cleaning the death chamber after executions			1
" @entity99 told me that cleaning the blood off the gurney did not affect him , " @entity6 said			0
" he said what got to him was washing the handprints , smeared lipstick , tear stains off the windows of the witness room where the man 's family was watching him die			0
" @entity6 said he began to imagine if the people on death row were his family members			1
" i would just act like it was my brother who was going to be on that gurney , and then i would cook , " @entity6 said			0
he wrote about his experiences and the almost 200 meals he prepared in a book titled " meals to die for			1
" since leaving prison he has opened a restaurant and married			0
he says he thinks about his conversation with @entity99 often and he really wants to keep the tradition of a last meal alive			0
but it seems that @entity4 will not take @entity6 up on his offer			2
" while we appreciate mr. @entity6 's offer , it 's not the cost but more the concept that we 're moving away from , " said @entity130 spokesman @entity129 .			0
