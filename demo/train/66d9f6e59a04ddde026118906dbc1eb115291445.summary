-- could @entity1 be the team which comes from nowhere to win the @entity3 finals in 2016 ? no , probably not			1
but this 2 - 0 win over @entity5 should not be scoffed at , especially by those who would have considered @entity1 escaping unscathed with a giant bar of @entity8 as an achievement in itself			1
chocolate aside , this result will be far more palatable for those who have endured a difficult time following @entity14 's side			0
@entity1 has not had much to smile about in recent months but perhaps it will allow itself time to enjoy a rare moment of success			1
the @entity17 was an unmitigated disaster as @entity1 failed to qualify from the group stage for the first time since 1950			1
beaten by @entity21 and @entity22 , it returned home following a goalless draw with @entity25 and faced a barrage of criticism			1
as is always the case with @entity1 , a period of national introspection followed where every single facet of the game was questioned from the grassroots coaching to the number of @entity37 players being able to ply their trade in the @entity39			1
for @entity14 , the man charged with transforming @entity1 's fortunes , this success will at least give him some breathing space			1
@entity44 , who recently signed for @entity45 after completing a move from @entity47 , scored both goals as @entity1 produced an encouraging performance			1
@entity14 , who has been under pressure ever since the @entity17 failure , even managed a smile -- no mean feat given the level of criticism he has endured in recent weeks			0
" i thought the way we approached the game from the first minute was exactly what we wanted and we got our reward , " @entity14 told @entity56			2
" we pressurized the ball well , but you need that first goal to get people to come out and attack you			0
" from then i thought we looked dangerous and we had several chances to aggravate the scoreline before @entity44 's second			0
" i think we can improve on how we see out the game , but you have to expect that some players will show a little naivety in that area			2
" both goals came as a result of counter attacks with @entity44 finishing off @entity78 's cross on 58 minutes after @entity1 had caught @entity5 short in defense			1
the second owed much to @entity44 's pace and power as he held off his opponent before firing the ball into the corner			0
@entity85 , the new @entity1 captain , said the pace of @entity1 's front three was key to his side 's success			2
" we defended well as a team and took our chances , catching them on the break with the speed we had been hoping to show , " @entity85 told @entity56			0
" i think we knew the game against @entity96 was going to be difficult , but tonight was always going to be more important and we were focusing on that			2
we have worked on springing from defense to attack which you saw tonight			0
it was a happy performance from us			0
" after making the @entity103 roll , @entity1 face @entity104 and @entity105 in its next round of qualifiers in october			2
@entity109 success elsewhere , @entity109 began the defense of its @entity112 title with a 5 - 1 home victory over @entity114 in @entity115			1
@entity116 opened the scoring from the penalty spot before further goals from @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 sealed the win			0
" this team has a lot of quality and excellent players and it was just a matter of time before we scored , " @entity115 's @entity120 told @entity125			0
" i am very pleased with the match , above all for my competitive debut here at home in @entity115 , and the goal and victory			0
" in @entity138 , @entity137 suffered a 1 - 0 home defeat by @entity140 in with @entity141 scoring the only goal of the game for the visitors			1
in @entity146 , @entity145 benefited from two own goals as it overcame @entity148 4 - 0 in @entity149 .			0
