for the better part of a decade , the world has seen an episodic stream of predictions that @entity4 was on the cusp of building a nuclear weapon and that an @entity8 or @entity9 pre-emptive military strike was imminent			1
alarming forecasts are again gaining currency because of a new assessment issued by the @entity14 nuclear watchdog : the @entity15 reported last week that @entity4 appears to be trying to develop a nuclear weapon			0
the specter of a nuclear weapon in the hands of someone as erratic as @entity4 president @entity21 would weigh heavily on decision - makers in @entity8 , @entity23 and @entity24 and throughout the international community			1
if and when @entity4 is seen as becoming the world 's 10th known nuclear power , many experts see danger mounting , whether from the " @entity4 bomb " or from having to " bomb @entity4			1
" the prospect alone has been enough to muscle national security to the forefront of the 2012 @entity9 presidential election , a contest that heretofore has focused on economic issues			0
as @entity41 sen. @entity41 recently put it , if @entity4 gets " a nuclear weapon , the world is going to go into darkness			0
" relying on satellite imagery and other information , the @entity15 suggests that @entity4 has advanced nuclear weapons development at its @entity46 military complex , about 20 miles southeast of @entity47			1
experts estimate that @entity4 could make enough weapons - grade enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon within six months			2
thus , even if @entity4 's claims of peaceful intent were true , @entity4 is shortening the timeline needed to achieve a nuclear - weapon breakout			2
@entity4 's checkered track record on nuclear transparency encourages worst - case analysis			2
no country agonizes over the threat posed by an @entity4 nuclear weapon more than @entity8			1
prime minister @entity62 , who once said , " it 's 1938 , and @entity4 is @entity64 , " last week called an @entity4 nuclear bomb a " grave , direct threat			1
" the @entity8 media have been filled with rumors about the growing likelihood of an assault on the @entity4 program , analogous to the way @entity8 destroyed the @entity74 osirak nuclear reactor 30 years ago or a @entity76 nuclear reactor in 2007			1
alas , military planners generally believe that any attempt to set back an @entity4 nuclear program would be far more complicated than either of those surgical operations			1
@entity4 's secret , multilayered and entrenched nuclear facilities and forces would require repeated air attacks on myriad sites over time			2
escalation could spiral out of control , while there would be no certainty about the demise of @entity4 's nuclear program			2
@entity4 's supreme leader , ayatollah @entity92 , has vowed to hit any attacker with an " iron fist			0
" but thus far , it remains a war of words			0
defense minister @entity97 said @entity8 has made no decision on whether to resort to force			0
while we may not be on the threshold of an @entity4 nuclear weapon , that day appears ever closer			1
several years ago , the @entity102 published a dossier by a team led by @entity105 , now the @entity108 administration 's top nonproliferation official			0
that report concluded that if @entity4 were to throw caution to the wind , it could produce a nuclear weapon by about 2010			2
that date has come and gone			0
no one outside @entity4 's inner circle can be certain about whether and when @entity4 will become a nuclear - weapon state , but @entity47 surely wants the outside world to continue guessing			2
even a slower timeline suggests that @entity4 could almost surely produce a nuclear weapon between 2013 and 2018 , placing the timing during the term of office being decided by the next @entity9 presidential election -- or beyond			1
accordingly , how to manage a recalcitrant @entity4 and how to support an ally , @entity8 , have become major features of the presidential campaign			1
a @entity128 debate on national security this past weekend provided a get - tougher - with - @entity4 set of policies that included more covert operations , support for @entity4 's political opposition , tighter economic sanctions , arming regional allies and deploying greater @entity9 military might to the region			1
and , as gov. @entity139 put it , " if all else fails , if after all the work we 've done , there 's nothing else we can do besides take military action , then of course , you take military action			0
" as @entity139 and most of the @entity128 candidates see it , an @entity4 nuclear weapon is unacceptable			1
" if we re-elect @entity108 , " the candidate said saturday , " @entity4 will have a nuclear weapon			0
" of course , it is easier for candidates than for officials to talk about covert operations designed to sabotage @entity4 's nuclear program			2
and yet there are numerous reports that the @entity9 or its allies have been behind clandestine attacks , whether against scientists working on @entity4 's nuclear program , the introduction of @entity164 malware to thwart @entity4 centrifuges or the recent explosion at an @entity169 ammunition depot or missile site near @entity171			1
one area in which many republicans appear to differ with the president 's policy is over the degree to which the @entity9 should be supporting regime change by expanding the support for @entity4 's @entity179 , which rose in 2009 but has gone underground			1
of course , one problem with trying to instigate a " @entity181 " is that overt @entity9 support for opposition could make regime opponents a bigger target and allow the regime to claim outside interference , rallying @entity4 around a more authoritarian government			2
@entity128 presidential candidates also called for stronger sanctions			0
for instance , some advocate sanctioning the @entity193			0
however , it is unclear whether the @entity9 could successfully pressure that institution , what effect it might have on @entity4 's nuclear program and how an attempt to close it might roil global oil markets and the fragile global economy			1
a better financial tourniquet might be to go after @entity4 as a money - laundering state , as this could lead to the entities making money for the regime 's hard core			0
this @entity128 assault on @entity9 's @entity4 policy clearly caught @entity108 's attention			1
in the midst of hosting the @entity211 summit in @entity212 , he spoke about how sanctions on @entity4 had " enormous bite and scope			0
" the president promised to " explore every avenue " and take no " option off the table , " an apparent reference to the possibility of military force			0
still , it remains to be seen whether any @entity9 president might try to live with deterring an @entity4 nuclear weapon the way @entity227 's nuclear program has been deterred rather than shut down ; one huge difference , however , is the wild card of what @entity8 would accept and do			1
@entity108 came to power promising to talk with @entity4 and @entity227			0
what he may not have bargained on was that neither government was interested in talking to his administration , at least not on @entity237 's terms			0
on the @entity239 , officials expect further provocations from nuclear @entity227 , and @entity9 policy is now focused on deterrence and crisis management			0
there may still be time to avoid a nuclear @entity4			0
@entity237 should double down on financial measures , support for political opponents , arms for allies and covert action			0
but the @entity9 needs to be resolute , not reckless			0
it needs statesmanship , not sound bites			0
if @entity4 succeeds in brandishing nuclear arms , all @entity9 , and not just one political party , will feel the repercussions of a post-american era in which no outside power can act as a security guarantor			1
as @entity9 winds down its wars in @entity74 and @entity262 , @entity4 leaders no doubt perceive a vacuum of power			2
if @entity9 lack the stomach for a fight , then there is little in @entity4 's way of grabbing more power in a brittle region that features a weak @entity74 state and a shaky @entity272 world order			1
@entity4 's brazen opportunism may well be what precipitates the unthinkable : another major military operation in the greater @entity277 .			1

@entity279 : @entity4 nuclear bomb would threaten *stability* of @entity277
he says it 's likely @entity4 could produce a bomb during next presidential term
@entity9 should still work to *prevent* @entity4 from developing nuclear weapons , he says
@entity290 : if @entity9 chose to live with deterring @entity4 nuclear bomb , what would @entity8 do ?
