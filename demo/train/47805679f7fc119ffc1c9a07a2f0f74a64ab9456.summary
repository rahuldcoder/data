@entity0 , @entity1 -- what 's next now that the oil stopped flowing , and what will happen when @entity6 's crippled well in the @entity7 is finally , permanently sealed ? that was the subject of a meeting about long - term cleanup up efforts thursday between the man overseeing the federal response to the oil spill and coastal parish officials			1
retired coast guard adm @entity16 said afterward that parish presidents " hold nothing back , " but the two sides agreed there should be no premature declaration of victory , when it comes to cleanup			1
the meeting came in @entity0 , @entity1 , two weeks after the ruptured well was capped and stopped leaking -- but before the final effort to permanently seal the well			1
@entity16 promised cooperation between multiple layers of government when " response " efforts evolve into " recovery " efforts in the @entity7			1
in what @entity16 described as a " very frank , productive conversation " the officials pledged to work together on long - term cleanup plans and jointly determine how clean coastal areas actually are			1
in addition , they discussed how to better respond to storms and what was learned from @entity43			2
some parish presidents contend that federal officials were too quick to remove booms and other oil - fighting equipment ahead of the storm , worrying it amounted to " downsizing			1
" and they talked about how next to use the many fishing vessels that have been pressed into service , laying out boom and doing other work			1
for example , those that are n't able to return to fishing as parts of the @entity7 are reopened might be used to start removing boom in weeks ahead			1
in a positive note for fishermen , @entity1 wildlife officials late thursday announced that portions of state waters east of the @entity66 in four parishes were re-opened to commercial fishing for fish and shrimp			1
they said the move followed extensive tests by the @entity73 that determined the fish were safe for consumption			2
after the meeting , @entity83 president @entity82 said , " i want to be sure there are enough assets in each of these parishes to fight this oil			2
" he said he wanted to ensure that for " any decision to downsize , which we know will happen someday , we will be included with that			2
" @entity1 gov. @entity88 , who attended the meeting , said " at times it was contentious , but i think it was productive			2
" he said he tried to impress upon federal officials that cleanup priorities in weeks ahead should come from the bottom , up			1
" what we suggest is that they allow each parish to come up with their own detailed plan , parish by parish , " he said			2
the meeting also included officials from a variety of federal agencies and @entity6 chief operating officer @entity106			1
meanwhile , the clock is ticking toward the effort to seal the well			1
@entity16 said in a separate briefing that crews are making good progress toward two well - killing efforts -- first by pouring mud and cement into it from the top in a move known as a " static kill " -- and then sealing it from the bottom through a relief well that 's been slowly drilled to intercept the crippled well			1
the first effort is planned for monday but might take place sooner , he said			2
the relief well may be ready for the " bottom kill " effort five to seven days after the static kill			2
@entity16 was asked whether the static kill was really necessary , or if it amounted to " playing with fire " -- in a move that could jeopardize the final effort to kill the well from the bottom			1
" i do n't think so , " he said			0
" our science team has come to the conclusion that we do have well integrity and that the well is safe to do a static kill			0
" he said first effort " would enhance and ultimately make more effective " the final well - killing effort from below			1
the ship that would pour the mud and cement for the static kill , the @entity143 , is on the scene and ready to go			0
and as flight crews find it harder and harder to spot oil on the surface of the water , @entity16 offered another bit of good news			1
he said said it 's very unlikely that any oil might wind up in the loop current that winds around @entity154 toward the @entity156 @entity155 -- something that had been a concern in the early days of the @entity6 oil spill			1
" the chances that oil will become entrained in the loop are very , very low -- and will go to zero as we control the leak at the well with the cap and ultimately kill it , " he said			0
that 's partly because oil has n't moved beyond the @entity154 panhandle and partly due to a stroke of luck from @entity171			0
" for the past several months now , there has been an eddy that has broken off the loop current between the wellhead and where the current actually comes north and turns and goes back down toward the @entity177 , " he said			0
" so there 's been an eddy that has created a barrier between the wellhead and the loop current			0
" the coming static kill should also provide a ream of data that will give experts a better idea how much oil actually leaked from the well during the nearly three months it was spewing oil			0
at the height of the spill , skimming vessels were collecting 25,000 barrels of oil a day			0
some scientists are skeptical the situation is improving and worry about how much oil may be lurking below the surface			0
" we 've swept the oil under the rug , if you will , because we 've applied a tremendous amount of dispersants to it , " said @entity201 , senior scientist for the @entity202			0
" speaking on @entity2 's " @entity213 , " he said , " what this means is that most of the oil has been dispersed throughout the entire water column , so that we 're not seeing it on the surface			0
" " my biggest concern is the long - term effects on the food chain because the small organisms are eaten by the bigger organisms , " he added			2
" it 's still underwater and could have an effect for years , if not decades to come			0
" but @entity224 , the @entity226 's chief scientist for fisheries , told @entity2 such a concern is , in some cases , unfounded			0
" oil does not necessarily bio-magnify into larger things , " @entity230 said			0
fish , dolphins and other larger sea animals process and excrete oil			0
however , he said , consumers " need to be more careful with oysters and shrimp			0
" one thing not going away soon -- the threat of litigation against @entity6			1
a panel of federal judges met in @entity246 , @entity247 thursday to consider arguments on where litigation over the @entity251 rig explosion and oil gusher should be consolidated			0
the @entity251 rig , off the coast of @entity1 , triggered the oil disaster when it exploded april 20 , killing 11 people , and sank shortly afterward			2
@entity0 and @entity257 , @entity258 , appear to be the favorites for the lawsuit sites because of their proximity to oil company offices and litigants surrounding the disaster .			0
