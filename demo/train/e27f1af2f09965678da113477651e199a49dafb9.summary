@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has the fastest two cars in @entity5 this season but there is just one problem -- there can only be one world champion			1
@entity11 and @entity12 arrive at the @entity1 @entity13 this weekend with the title fight distilled into a thrillingly intense duel			1
@entity3 is desperate to keep a lid on the seething tensions spilling over from a @entity19 bust - up as the @entity21 team chases its first world title since 1955			1
but is it too late to mend the poisoned relationship between the star drivers ? where did it go wrong ? in the dry desert heat of @entity31 , rivalries between the @entity3 teammates began to sizzle			2
@entity12 complained over the team radio when @entity11 cut across him to retake the lead , saying the move was " not on			1
" @entity3 then warned the drivers " to bring both cars home " as they vied for victory until the checkered flag			2
@entity39 was not exactly home sweet home for @entity12 , who lives in the principality			2
after setting the fastest time in qualifying , the @entity21 went off track -- denying @entity11 , who was behind him , a chance to set his potential quickest time			2
there was more drama in @entity49 when @entity3 asked @entity11 to allow @entity12 , who was on a different tire strategy , to pass			1
the 2008 world champion , who was second at the time , refused to obey the team order and finished third , one place ahead of @entity12			1
the pair 's duel was short but by no means sweet in @entity19 two weeks ago			2
in an ill - judged attempt to take the lead on lap two , @entity12 gave @entity11 's car a punctured tire and effectively put him out of the race			1
the @entity21 finished second but was greeted by a chorus of boos on the podium from fans who saw his pass as a deliberately cynical move			0
who 's to blame ? @entity12 increasingly finds himself cast as the bad guy , akin to @entity74 in cartoon caper " @entity76			2
" after admitting the @entity78 clash was his fault , @entity3 handed him a hefty fine -- although not by @entity5 driver salary standards			1
but the 29 - year - old , who is always polite and affable in person , has since apologized to @entity11 and told the media melee in @entity0 this week he was not proud of his behavior			2
@entity12 may not be machiavellian but one thing is for sure , @entity11 has had his share of bad luck in 2014			1
whether it was brake failures or engine fires , fate has been a fickle friend			0
but is @entity11 entirely blameless ? well , the @entity94 has arguably brought some hard luck on himself			0
there have , in particular , been misjudgments in qualifying , most notably in @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 , when he chose not to set a final lap when the damp track conditions were improving			0
interactive : take a tour of the @entity0 circuit who 's refereeing the fight ? @entity3 wants to calm tensions between its racers as it attempts to win both the driver and constructor titles			0
five days after the @entity19 bust - up , the team issued a statement warning " another such incident will not be tolerated			0
" it added : " @entity11 and @entity12 understand and accept the team 's number one rule : there must be no contact between the team 's cars on track			1
" @entity3 motorsport director @entity126 said in @entity1 he was not ruling out changing a driver lineup if " we are not able to manage the two of them			0
" @entity12 recently signed a new contract , which will keep him at the team until the end of 2016 , while @entity11 has a deal until 2015			1
@entity5 's governing body , the @entity135 , decided not to investigate the spa clash , even after @entity12 admitted his culpability			1
there has been debate among @entity5 experts about whether the @entity135 should be more proactive in refereeing the heavyweight title bout or whether it should stand by and let the drivers slug it out			1
asked by @entity2 in @entity1 whether the @entity135 should have investigated the @entity78 incident more closely , @entity11 responded : " that 's a very good question because how do we move forward ? " does that mean we can race a lot closer and if the guy in front comes off and is out of the race , nothing 's going to happen ? or does it mean if it happens again there will be a penalty ? " we 're always asking to be able to race ... but there 's a fine line			0
" who 's in pole position for the title ? with seven races left to go , @entity12 has a 29 - point lead over @entity11			1
he is on course to win his first world title and follow in the footsteps of his father @entity168 , the 1982 champion			0
@entity11 knows this is his best chance of winning a second world title since his triumph with @entity172 in 2008			1
the @entity101 racer has to keep out of trouble on track and hope his luck turns			0
there is , however , a new twist to the 2014 season , which could be decisive			0
the final race in @entity181 will reward the drivers with double points , which means a win is worth 50 points and second place 36 points			0
but if @entity12 takes a 15 - point advantage to the desert finale he can afford to finish second to @entity11 and still win the title			1
while the two @entity3 drivers are locked in an intense fight , @entity192 is sneaking up on the rails			1
the @entity197 racer has the momentum after winning the last two races in @entity49 and @entity19 and is now 64 points behind @entity12 in the standings			1
could the @entity202 snatch the title ? " yeah i can , " @entity192 said in @entity1			0
" but it obviously is going to take more than just winning the next seven races			0
it is going to have to take a bit of luck as well			0
" if they crash into each other at every race this year that will probably hand me the championship on a platter ! " who can handle the heat ? there is a feeling in the @entity219 that the intense 2014 championship is turning into a psychological battle between the @entity3 men			2
" your mental state is always important in sport , " @entity12 chirpily agreed in @entity1			0
the @entity3 rivals are very different characters and very different racers			0
on one side of the garage is the ice - cool calm and consistency of @entity12 and on the other side is @entity11 's fiery passion and blistering pace			2
keeping a cool head , as well as a steady hand on the wheel , could decide which of the contenders wins the 2014 world title .			0

@entity3 drivers @entity12 and @entity11 are battling for the @entity5 world championship
the two collided at the @entity19 @entity13 , with @entity12 being heavily *criticized*
