editor 's note : @entity2 is a speaker and advocate for transgender and transsexual issues			1
she is the author of a memoir , " @entity7 : a journey of @entity9			2
" her web site is http://www.donnarose.com / @entity2 says transgender people do n't fit the stereotypes society often tries to impose			1
( @entity13 ) -- it was only a matter of time			2
the real - life drama of being transsexual has come to @entity18			1
@entity19 , the impossibly cute little blond girl who , for many of my generation , remains frozen in time as the sweet , chubby - faced cherub closing many a @entity25 and @entity26 show in the arms of her doting parents , recently announced that he is transsexual and will be transitioning from female to male			1
he will go by the name of @entity19			1
as shocking as this news may be to some , it is yet another reminder that all is not necessarily as it appears and that each of us is more complicated than simply the skin and bones of our bodies			2
rather , it is our heart and spirit that defines us			2
transgender people -- that is , people who may not experience or express their gender in ways that are necessarily typical for the physical sex of their body -- have been part of the fabric of cultures for as long as history has been recorded			1
we 're a cross-section of society -- pilots , engineers , doctors , factory workers , artisans and pretty much anything else you can imagine			2
it was only a matter of time before we came to @entity18			1
make no mistake -- @entity19 is n't the first and certainly wo n't be the last			1
despite what others choose to believe , transsexual people are no longer relegated to hiding in safe little shadows for fear that society will detect them and punish them			1
we are far more than traditional stereotypes of transpeople as hookers , drug - users , porn stars or social misfits relegated to the fringes of society			2
in a very real sense , transgender people are no one thing			1
we are everyone , everywhere			2
whether you realize it or not , we go to your school , we are active in your communities of faith , we are your neighbors , your co-workers , your family members			2
we live in a world that tries to force all of us to conform to the expectations and roles established for our bodies at birth , yet our heart and our spirit often realize that we have been miscast in life			1
we are forced to ask questions of ourselves about things that few ever consider			0
the search for answers is indeed the pathway for overall happiness and fulfillment in life			1
this is a journey that each of us is on -- trans and not -- and the simple fact of the matter is that the transgender journey may appear unique , but the end goal is a universal one : happiness			1
needless to say , there are those who continue to live in a world where " different " somehow automatically means bad , or is a threat			0
these are people who would keep transgender people trapped in stigmas of mental illness , moral weakness , sexual perversion and general societal freakishness			1
our defense is a simple one : we prove who we are , individually and collectively , not with words but with the courage to come out and the ability to live our lives with dignity and grace			0
it may come as a surprise for many people in this country to recognize that many of us who are transsexual are not embarrassed , ashamed or otherwise apologetic of who or what we are			1
we refuse to go back into the stifling closet of trying to be something we 're not			0
we enjoy each and every day being unique , as men and women and everything in between , and we rejoice in our diversity rather than fear it			0
the ties that bind us are far more than the obvious connections of gender			0
they are bonds of courage , authenticity , integrity and pride			0
this is not a journey about surgery			0
it is not a journey about being " fixed			0
" it 's not about the clothes			0
it 's not about sexuality , or hormones , or any other single thing			0
it is a journey of self , full of uplifting revelations and heartbreaking realizations			0
a major point on that journey is gaining a sense of self - awareness and self - acceptance			0
@entity19 's recent announcement indicates that he has reached that point and is well on his way to be who he will become			1
it may come as a surprise to some that it is still legal to fire someone in this country , or to deny housing simply because they come out as transgender			1
transgender people are victimized by crime more frequently than the general population			1
many of us find ourselves unemployed and unable to be hired for jobs for which we are well qualified simply because we are transgender			2
and , as harsh as this life can be for us , many previous generations had it even worse			2
things are changing -- slowly but surely			0
why are they changing ? because transgender people are here to stay			1
we 've been here all along and we 're finally acknowledging that our unique journey is part of who we are , but not all of who we are			0
@entity19 is a courageous brother			1
he is a role model to others struggling with similar issues and questions			0
he is someone who has taken control of his life and intends to live it to the fullest			2
these are not things to fear			0
these are things to admire			0
the message here is not one of our bodies , but one of our spirits			0
it is not one of becoming something you 're not ; it is of accepting what you are			0
as @entity232 writer @entity231 said : " it is better to be hated for what you are than loved for what you 're not			0
" many of us have experienced these words first - hand and know them to be true			0
@entity19 knows who and what he is			1
that is not something to fear			0
that is something to celebrate			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : @entity19 *highlights* transgender presence in @entity18
@entity2 says transgender people are in all walks of life
she says they face *obstacles* to expressing their real identity
@entity2 : transgender people accept and celebrate who they are
