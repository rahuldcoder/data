-- if @entity2 is to continue its sales dominance in the new gaming and entertainment console market , it may be one of its most popular exclusive titles for the @entity8 that does the trick			1
" @entity10 : @entity16 " continues the franchise 's story of enhanced humans who are able to use special powers for good or for evil			1
this episode benefits in many ways , though , because the developer , @entity18 , start working with @entity2 early into the development cycle of the @entity8 and really get a sense of how the new console would work			1
a new protagonist and a new city let the animators really explore areas of expression that they could n't do with the older generation consoles			0
animation director @entity30 said the result is a real city -- @entity33 -- that feels more natural than those in previous " infamous " titles			0
" we took the familiarity of the ' @entity10 ' universe			1
we know what makes people happy			0
we know what makes us grin , " @entity30 told @entity0			0
" we decided to essentially rework everything else , because the @entity8 let us			2
" @entity33 , where @entity18 is based , is rendered in fine detail -- from the familiar spire of the @entity46 to shops along @entity48			0
cut scenes and in - game dynamics work together to show how the player has already interacted with buildings or other people , and create deeper player immersion			2
" we 're able to get all the subtleties in the characters themselves and all the nuances of actors , " @entity30 said			0
" we 're capturing every single thing we get on stage , which is totally insane			0
we avoid the ' @entity61 ' ( digital characters that appear too lifelike ) effect you usually see in most games			0
" @entity65 , vice president of marketing for @entity66 , said it was important to bring in the crew from @entity18 before the @entity8 was launched to give console builders a better idea how developers were going to use the new device			1
" the @entity8 was done hand in hand with development and ' @entity10 ' was one of those titles brought in early , " @entity65 said			1
the result was not only an open - world game with plenty of action , but a wide - ranging story that explores the moral quandaries ingrained within the franchise 's story			2
do you choose the path of the hero , or flip the coin and become the villain ? " how ruthless can you be ? how heroic can you be ? how true can you stay to that ( path ) to earn the biggest reward ? " says @entity91 , public relations manager for @entity66			2
while @entity65 wo n't call " @entity16 " the @entity8 's killer app , chatter on social media and forum have shown many people are using the game as their " excuse " to buy the new console			1
however , expectations from fans and critics alike are very high			0
" ' @entity10 ' has always been my favorite @entity2 - exclusive franchise , and the first ' @entity10 ' was actually the reason i bought a @entity8 3 a few years into its lifecycle			1
everything i saw at @entity109 2013 made me say that i would own a @entity8 4 prior to the launch of ' @entity10 : @entity16 ' , just because the title wowed me that much , " explained @entity111 , editor - in - chief of @entity113 writers			1
" i expect it to deliver the same open - world superhero experience the first two retail entries brought us , but in a way that harnesses the power of the @entity8			2
" @entity65 said this is just the beginning for what he calls blockbuster titles for the @entity8 , and explains there is a strategy to it all			2
with " @entity127 , " " @entity128 , " " @entity129 , " and " @entity130 " on the horizon , he thinks " infamous : @entity16 " has the initial lasting power to potentially sell more hardware			0
" you buy a platform and you 're actually looking not only at the game you 're buying today , but the content that 's coming ... because that promise is really important when you are putting down $ 399 for hardware , " @entity65 said			1
@entity30 pointed out it was a huge benefit for @entity18 to hold off releasing the new title until they could do something to show off the new console 's power			1
" a lot of what we wanted to do was provide justification for purchasing the hardware , " @entity30 said			0
" in the process , it gave us so much ( flexibility ) to actually let people justify buying another ' @entity10 ' title			1
it is as close as you can get to buying a new ip ( intellectual property ) utilizing the same universe			0
" however , a five - month delay for a blockbuster title could have spelled potential doom as it has for other new console starts ( i.e. : @entity166 's @entity165 )			1
@entity166 sales of their new console struggled in its fledgling months , mostly due to the lack of gaming titles that appealed to their audience			0
@entity111 does n't think @entity2 is in any danger , and actually will benefit from the release time			0
" @entity2 has a much better relationship with third - party developers than @entity166 does , and right now @entity2 just has more credibility with core gamers , " @entity111 said			0
" the success or failure of ' @entity10 : @entity16 ' wo n't change any of those facts			2
that said , if ' @entity10 ' does click with gamers , the @entity8 will be a hard console to compete with			1
" " @entity10 : @entity16 " is a @entity8 exclusive and was released worldwide on march 21			1
it is rated @entity187 due to blood , drug reference , language , sexual themes , and violence .			0

' @entity10 : second son ' is an exclusive @entity8 title
*designers* had *access* to the new console before it was released
for some , it 's been the " excuse " to buy a @entity8
