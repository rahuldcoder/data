-- dreaming of @entity2 is one way that prince @entity4 escapes from the stresses he faces as the future king of @entity7			1
" i regularly daydream , " @entity4 reveals in the documentary " prince @entity4 's passion : @entity10 , @entity11			1
" " @entity2 is definitely one of the places i go to ... i have hundreds of animals on my @entity15			2
so if i am ever having quite a stressful day ... you can put a buffalo on in the background or a cricket , " he says			0
this may sound like a small , even trivial , detail but it 's a thought that may one day help define the @entity7 monarchy			2
" it takes you back instantly to the ( @entity2 ) bush			2
and it does completely settle me down			0
" prince @entity4 will one day be king , and he 's acutely aware of the responsibility that comes with that ; it weighs heavily on his thoughts			1
and even before he takes on that mantle , he 's grappling with the often unwelcome attentions of the world media			0
everything he does , or is rumored to do , makes a headline , somewhere			0
his fame has only been compounded by his choice of wife and the birth of his heir , @entity43			0
@entity44 makes first public appearance since royal baby was born there 's no suggestion that prince @entity4 would ever drop out of public life , but he does crave normality			1
he needs a dose of it every now and then to cope with the maelstrom that surrounds him			0
the prince gets some of that normality from his role in the military where he 's treated as " one of the guys , " but he also gets it from @entity2			1
for @entity4 , @entity2 provides an escape that helps with his royal work back home : " its escaping to a kind of different world where i am just who i normally am anyway , and i can let that side , that sort of slightly immature , silly person come out a bit more than i normally do			1
" he enjoys the lack of airs and graces : " there 's not sycophants or anything like that			0
you 're very much treated as one of the team , and if you 're not pulling your weight , you 're told to man - up and get on with it			0
" prince @entity4 told me @entity2 first got under his skin during a trip to @entity85 when he was 17			1
he saw an elephant that had been darted : " it just blew my mind really			0
it was being that close to something so huge , something so majestic and part of nature 's great wonders , and again its vulnerability , it was lying in the @entity95 just breathing away with its ears flapped over its eyes to shut it from the sun. " that experience , he says , made him realize how powerful we are as humans , and ever since he 's wanted to do what he can to protect @entity2 and its wildlife			2
this drive has culminated in his support for the @entity108 which were set up to recognize outstanding achievement in conservation on the continent			0
soon after his first visit to @entity2 , @entity4 heard about @entity113 and became its patron in 2005			1
he supports the charity by visiting its conservation projects in @entity2 and by attending fundraising events on their behalf			2
the charity was one of the first patronages he took on			0
if you 're in any doubt about his connection to the cause , watch as he comes close to tears talking about @entity127 , who risks his life every day in the fight against elephant poachers			0
fatherhood has strengthened @entity4 's resolve : " suddenly you start thinking of like , wow , there is stuff you want to safeguard for the future			1
i 've always believed it , but to actually really feel it as well , it 's coming through powerfully now as well			0
" for @entity4 , @entity2 is a very emotional place			1
he told me he likes to watch the sun set with a rum , reminiscing			0
his mother , @entity143 , @entity143 , is never far from his thoughts			1
" what i am doing in @entity2 is probably not as obviously , visually if you like , related to what she did			2
but helping communities , and helping @entity2 , as she has done , and did with communities over in the @entity7 , and around the world ... it 's about helping the needy and the vulnerable			1
" his personal connection with @entity2 was sealed when he got engaged to @entity156 in @entity85 in 2010			1
he told me it felt appropriate : " i did n't really plan it that far in advance , like i just knew i wanted it to feel comfortable where i did it and i wanted it to mean something , other than just the act of getting engaged			0
" @entity4 says it just happened on that particular holiday : " she understands what it means to me being in @entity2 , and my love of conservation			1
" the prince is already planning his next trip , once things settle down at home : " i think as soon as @entity176 grows up a little bit more			2
i will be hung if i go now ... it 's definitely a plan of mine to go back to @entity2			1
i will always have @entity2 as a special place that i love to go back to			0
