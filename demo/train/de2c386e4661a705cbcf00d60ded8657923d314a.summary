-- " @entity1 's political elites appear to enjoy typical hobbies -- such as travel , horseback riding and skiing			1
not surprisingly , however , they are able to indulge their hobbies on a grand scale			0
" @entity11 begins a cable from a diplomat at the @entity14 in @entity1 , written in 2008			2
what follows is an eye - opening tale of lavish living , including @entity20 's performance at a birthday party for a seven - figure sum , a palace in the @entity24 and prodigious drinking			1
coming on the day @entity29 secretary of state @entity28 arrives in @entity1 for a conference , the timing of the leak could not have been more poignant			1
the cable begins with a visit by @entity29 diplomats to president @entity35 's horse farm , which has " a large stable , indoor and outdoor riding arenas and a clubhouse " as well as about 40 horses from various parts of the world			1
" @entity35 is also fond of traveling to warmer climes , " the cable continues , mentioning that he had traded local property for a " palace " in the @entity24			2
quoting @entity46 officials , the cable adds that the @entity1 president also had a mansion in @entity46			1
other @entity1 officials also come under the spotlight , with a detailed account of prime minister @entity53 's visit to a nightclub called @entity55 in the capital , @entity57			2
apparently , the prime minister was quite the dancer : " his companions quickly tired but @entity53 remained , dancing alone and animatedly for another 15 - 20 minutes			0
" later , the cable describes a dinner held for a visiting @entity29 delegation by one of @entity1 's wealthiest men , @entity63			1
" it is not clear what @entity63 is spending his billions on , " the cable continues , " but it is certainly not culinary talent			0
" the menu featured boiled meat and noodles , and " the wait staff appeared to be graduates of a @entity75 cafeteria trading academy			0
" in a section entitled " private concerts with the @entity78 , " the cable describes the 2007 birthday celebrations of the president 's son - in - law , @entity81			1
not only were @entity83 's biggest pop stars on hand , " the headliner was @entity20 , to whom he reportedly paid 1 million pounds ( $ 1.55 million ) for this one - time appearance			2
" @entity6 has reached out to @entity20 's representatives for comment			0
in the same year , singer @entity90 was reportedly flown in to perform for @entity35 's daughter			0
it seems that being posted to @entity1 was rarely dull , as far as characters are concerned			2
the leaked cable ends with a florid description of then defense minister @entity96 , who " appears to enjoy loosening up in the tried and true ' homo - sovieticus ' style -- i.e. drinking oneself into a stupor			0
" it recounts a meeting between the minister and a senior @entity104 official in june 2007			0
" slouching in his chair and slurring all kinds of @entity83 participles , @entity96 explained to this very senior guest that he had just been at a cadet graduation reception , ' toasting @entity1 's newly - commissioned officers			1
' " spotting the opportunity for a zinger , the cable 's author observes : " who was toasted more -- the defense minister or the cadets -- is a matter of pure speculation			0
