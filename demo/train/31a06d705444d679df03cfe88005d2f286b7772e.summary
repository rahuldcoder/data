@entity0 -- loud chants rise up from the street below , the noise bouncing off the wall of the building across the way and pouring in to an apartment on the top floor of a block in @entity11 , a working class suburb of @entity0			1
" the people , united , will never be divided ! " yells the crowd , angrily waving banners and placards			0
" to fight is the only way ! " @entity18 pokes her head out of the window , watching the commotion below with interest , as dog - walkers , mothers with strollers , and pensioners carrying shopping bags join the throng			1
the scores of people gathering on the sidewalk are no nosey neighbors -- indeed , many of them are complete strangers to the family living on the fifth floor -- but they are all here to protect @entity18 from eviction			0
the mother - of - one , with brightly - dyed hair , braces on her teeth , and worry etched on her face , hangs her head as she explains how she got here : the move from @entity44 in 2003 , when times were good and jobs plentiful in @entity51 , the decision to invest in a home for @entity18 and her son , now 17 and in high school			1
but then the global financial crisis hit , bringing @entity51 's economy to its knees ; @entity18 lost her jobs -- in a shop , and as a cleaner -- and the mortgage payments spiraled out of reach			1
she is an example of the crisis many @entity51 face as the country deals with the highest unemployment since the @entity64 in the 1930s , and a recession entering its second year			1
for a while , @entity18 got by on benefits , but then those stopped too , and now the bailiffs are circling			0
" they are about to evict me , and i 'm fighting to stay because i do n't have anywhere else to go , " she says			0
" i have n't paid my mortgage because i ca n't -- i do n't have any work			0
" inside the cosy two - bedroom apartment , there 's little sign that the family may be turned out onto the street at any moment : the tv is on in the lounge , shelves and closets are full , and a piece of meat sits on the kitchen counter top , defrosting in time for tonight 's dinner			1
in the main bedroom , there 's just one concession to the very real threat that @entity18 might be about to lose her home : a large black suitcase sits , empty , atop a bedspread dotted with pink roses			1
" i ca n't stand the thought of living on the streets with my son , but i have no idea where else to go , " she says			0
" just thinking about it makes me very sad			0
" @entity18 's story is echoed by others all over @entity51 : the global financial crisis knocked the bottom out of the country 's housing market and sparked a major recession that left thousands jobless			1
the country 's unemployment rate stands at 26 % -- its highest level ever -- and the situation is even worse for young people , with more than 55 % of 16 to 24 - year - olds out of work			1
with no income , many are finding themselves unable to afford the mortgage payments on homes that are no longer worth the prices paid for them			0
@entity123 is one of those who lost his home			0
the 33 - year - old used to work in a grocery store , but was made redundant when the company got into trouble			2
now he sleeps in @entity0 's @entity130 , a tourist hotspot by day , and cardboard city peopled by the homeless at night			1
" i was able to get unemployment benefits , but time has run out , " he says			0
" i ca n't afford to pay for things , so now i 'm living on the street ... it 's hard , but that 's the way it is			2
" @entity123 says the financial crisis has left many ordinary @entity51 homeless : " people are losing their jobs			1
now they ca n't pay their mortgages , they ca n't provide for their families , they struggle			0
" people have an image of the homeless that is not real -- they see somebody with a box of wine and they think we 're all like that , [ but ] that 's not the case ... even people with degrees are living on the street			2
" it is this fear that has driven many @entity51 people to action -- compelled to act by what they see as the gross unfairness of everyday life in @entity51 in 2013 , where struggling citizens are evicted , even as hundreds of homes lie empty			1
dozens of those gathered outside the door of @entity18 's apartment block are supporters of " @entity177 " ( @entity178 ) , part of the platform of people affected by @entity182 ( @entity183 ) a group which campaigns to prevent banks and authorities turfing those hit by the country 's economic woes out of their homes			2
" for every eviction , an occupation ! " they shout , accusing the banks and authorities of " real estate terrorism			0
" " the next eviction should be at the @entity201 ! [ the @entity51 prime minister 's official residence ] " runs another chant ; a few short years ago , most @entity51 would have shied away from such overtly political protests			1
activist @entity203 , 24 , says @entity51 's troubled history had left many wary of becoming involved in political issues : " forty years of @entity207 's dictatorship made people disconnect from politics			1
" but when simmering anger and resentment about the government and the economy gave way to the mass marches of the 15 - m movement -- also known as the " @entity217 " -- the floodgates were opened			1
in 2011 , thousands of @entity51 took to the country 's streets , inspiring the global " @entity222 " movement with their protest camp in @entity0 's @entity224 @entity225 , 28 , was one of the first to take part in the demonstrations , which she says were a political awakening for the @entity51 people			1
" citizens were not used to speaking out on political issues			0
my parents never discussed politics with me , but now that is changing			0
the movement awoke a lot of people who were not interested in politics before			2
" @entity203 agrees : " the 15 - m movement made people talk about social issues , and about politics in normal conversations -- in cafes , restaurants , bars -- where before they only talked about football or fashion			1
" nowadays , @entity0 is a city of protests -- it is almost impossible to cross the capital without coming across a sit - in or a march , petitions are everywhere , and the activists have returned to the @entity224 the demonstrations are organized through the internet , particicularly @entity263 and @entity264			1
" we use the social networks to communicate , " explains @entity265 , brandishing her smartphone			0
" this is the tool that has permitted us to fight together , and to feel that we are not alone			0
" their subjects are anything and everything -- from education reform to job losses , government cuts to corruption -- but all reflecting a widespread dissatisfaction with politicians and their handling of the country 's economic crisis			2
" they are destroying our future , " says college student @entity285 , as she participates in a march in support of public education			0
" we know there 's a crisis , but it could be less if they managed the money better			2
" all the political parties do is accuse each other , the government is destroying the country , and the conditions for workers are getting worse and worse			0
" each protest is color - coded : @entity303 for healthcare workers , green for the education sector , orange for social services , red for general trade union members , and black for public service workers			2
on saturday , february 23 , all these individual groups are expected to unite for rainbow - hued mass demonstrations in towns and cities across @entity51 , known as the " @entity313 " ( @entity314 of citizens )			1
back in @entity11 , the moment of truth has arrived , but the crowd -- now shouting at the police , insisting they should be ashamed of themselves for helping to evict families -- appears to have had an impact			0
@entity18 is summoned downstairs , as lawyers from the @entity183 explain that she will be able to stay -- for a while at least			0
for those working to stop @entity51 's eviction epidemic , today has seen a small and temporary victory : the bailiffs have been put off for now , but @entity18 knows they may yet return			1
for those demonstrating about cuts , corruption and a lack of cash , the protests will go on			2
@entity1 's @entity336 contributed to this report .			2

@entity51 has seen hundreds of protests since the " @entity217 " movement *erupted*
in 2011 , activists took over @entity0 's @entity224 , inspiring the global " occupy " campaign
two years on , many are still angry , and marches and sit - ins are common in the capital
a mass demonstration is *planned* in towns and cities across @entity51 on february 23
