-- an @entity2 judge agreed wednesday with defense attorneys that prosecutors in the manslaughter trial of self - help author @entity6 improperly withheld evidence , but he decided not to grant a defense motion for a mistrial			1
@entity6 is accused of manslaughter in three deaths at his october 2009 " @entity14 " retreat in the desert			1
@entity15 , 38 , of @entity16 , @entity17 , died that night			0
so did @entity18 , 40 , of @entity19			0
volunteer @entity20 , 49 , of @entity21 , @entity22 , died nine days after the ceremony			0
at least 15 others who took part in the sweat lodge ceremony became ill. more than 40 others were uninjured			0
prosecutors argued that the lodge -- made of willow trees and branches , and covered with tarpaulins and blankets -- was heated to a perilously high temperature , causing the participants to suffer dehydration and heatstroke			2
defense attorneys filed a motion monday accusing prosecutors of intentionally withholding a report from environmental expert @entity41 , which suggests that the faulty design of the sweat lodge caused or contributed to the deaths			1
" at issue is a report , or an e-mail , drafted by an environmental engineer that states two relevant factors , " defense attorney @entity46 told judge @entity47 during wednesday 's hearing			1
" one , that carbon dioxide , not heat stroke , is a possible cause of death			0
... and secondly , that various environmental conditions created by the design of the sweat lodge -- for which mr. @entity6 has no responsibility -- could have contributed to those deaths			1
" @entity46 told @entity47 that prosecutors ' response to the motion was " aggressively unrepentant			1
" defense attorneys contend that a " @entity70 violation " has taken place			2
a @entity70 violation occurs when the failure to disclose material exculpatory evidence to the defense deprives a defendant of a fair trial			1
@entity77 means the evidence could be used to establish a defendant 's innocence ; material means the evidence is relevant and significant			2
prosecutor @entity81 said the state does n't believe that the conduct met the criteria for a @entity70 violation			0
" it was not disclosed due to an oversight , " @entity81 said , adding that the state has turned over thousands of pages of information			2
@entity47 said he agreed that a @entity70 violation had occurred but declined to grant a mistrial			1
the trial is set to continue thursday			1
@entity41 's findings were in a report that was e-mailed to lead detective @entity96 almost a year ago , on april 29 , 2010			0
@entity6 's attorneys first learned about @entity41 when he was listed as a potential witness in late october			1
since november , they say , they asked prosecutors for @entity41 's report four times			2
they got it last week			0
though the state decided not to call @entity41 as a witness at the trial , @entity2 's discovery law requires prosecutors to provide the expert 's report			2
there is also an ongoing obligation by prosecutors to turn over all material that could exonerate a defendant			2
because they are receiving @entity41 's report several weeks into the trial , and because that testimony could have had a profound impact on their strategy , defense attorneys argue that the judge has no choice but to grant a mistrial			1
the sweat lodge ceremony consisted of eight rounds , with each round lasting 10 to 15 minutes			0
although they were not prevented from leaving , participants have said they were told to wait until the breaks between rounds			0
@entity6 's attorneys have argued that the deaths were accidental and suggested that exposure to an unknown toxin in the lodge -- perhaps a pesticide , rat poison or something in the type of wood used to heat the rocks -- could have caused the fatalities			1
the event participants paid up to $ 10,000 to seek " new areas of consciousness " at the retreat , according to testimony			0
many had attended previous @entity145 seminars			0
in @entity147 's @entity146 and @entity148 contributed to this report .			0

new : the trial is set to resume thursday
judge @entity47 agreed that prosecutors withheld evidence
at issue is an e-mail that was not turned over to the defense
@entity6 is charged with manslaughter in three deaths at his 2009 retreat
