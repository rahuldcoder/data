-- as many as 400 children have died of lead poisoning - related illnesses in @entity3 since march , two international aid groups say , and as many as 30,000 people could be affected by lead contamination			2
the deaths occurred predominantly in children under the age of 5 in the state of @entity11 , according to @entity12 , the emergency manager for @entity13			2
the group is also known by its @entity16 name , @entity13			2
@entity12 told @entity0 tuesday that the death toll may be even higher , but said the numbers should n't mask the crisis			1
" rather than focus on specific death toll numbers , because those often are very difficult to obtain , the international community should focus on the harsh reality in @entity3 : it is very clear that a serious and significant number of children have died due to lead poisoning , " she said			1
a study conducted by the @entity32 and the @entity33 of @entity11 " identified 180 villages where children may have been poisoned by lead , which means that up to 30,000 people could be affected , " said a statement friday from the @entity36 ' @entity35			0
the report on child deaths comes a few months after the @entity3 government announced in early june the deaths of more than 160 @entity3 , including scores of children , of lead poisoning due to illegal gold mining			0
" the lead poisoning is a consequence of villagers practicing small - scale gold extraction from lead - containing ore			1
the processing of the ore involves crushing and drying , often inside the homes of villagers , resulting in the contamination of soil , " doctors without @entity57 explained in a statement			1
since june , @entity3 health officials have cooperated with the @entity32 to clean up the affected areas			0
since the process began , two out the seven villages known to be affected have been decontaminated , @entity12 said			0
" we already started in june treating patients			0
we are focusing on treatment of children under 5 but the most important thing is the remediation , or clean - up , so the exposure can stop , " she added			1
remediation is a lengthy process that requires removing all the contaminated soil and replacing it with clean soil			1
the process was stopped in the month of august due to the beginning of the rainy season but it started up again a few weeks ago			0
efforts to clean up contaminated areas are being hampered by the reluctance of villagers to report potential lead exposure , for fear the @entity3 government will prohibit the informal gold mining , @entity35 said			2
doctors without @entity57 says it 's still treating hundreds of lead - poisoning cases in @entity11 , but the group warned that the treatment is only effective if patients do not return to contaminated sites .			0

@entity13 says the death toll may be even higher
the contamination comes from villagers ' attempts to extract gold from ore
the clean - up involves removing contaminated soil and replacing it with clean soil
