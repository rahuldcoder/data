@entity1 inspectors prepared to examine the site of a suspected chemical weapons attack in @entity4 on monday , a strike a @entity7 official said was all but certain was carried out by the embattled @entity4 government			1
rebel forces and @entity4 president @entity11 's government have been blaming each other for wednesday 's reported attack in a suburb of @entity15 , which opposition members say killed hundreds			1
gruesome video of the aftermath showed numerous bodies , including women and children			0
the @entity7 official , who was not authorized to speak on the record , said the evidence pointing to government forces goes beyond images and open - source reporting from doctors and others			2
" there is nothing credible to indicate that the rebels , either the @entity34 or even @entity35 , have used chemical weapons , " the official said			2
" only the @entity11 regime is responsible for chemical weapons use			1
" the @entity4 government has steadfastly denied its forces used chemical weapons outside @entity15 or elsewhere and repeated the denial sunday			1
but a second @entity7 official said sunday that tissue samples were collected from the scene in the hours and days after the august 21 attack			1
the official says the evidence was " collected by multiple international sources " and was being analyzed in secure locations			0
the official would not say how the samples were collected or specify where the analysis was taking place			0
but with the @entity7 and its allies warning of military action , @entity4 's leading ally invoked the history of @entity61 claims about @entity62 urged @entity63 to avoid " a reckless enterprise			1
" @entity66 's @entity65 said unilateral force that bypassed the @entity1 would " undermine international efforts to find a political and diplomatic solution to the @entity4 conflict , lead to its further escalation and have an extremely destructive effect on what already is an explosive situation in the @entity75			1
" " all this is reminiscent of events of 10 years ago in which , using false information that the @entity62 possessed weapons of mass destruction as a pretext and bypassing the @entity1 , the @entity7 launched a reckless enterprise with consequences that everyone is well aware of , " @entity65 spokesman @entity77 said in a written statement			1
the statement added : " our @entity7 and @entity90 partners should realize what catastrophic consequences such a policy would have for the region , for the @entity97 world , and for the entire @entity99 world			0
" @entity4 agrees to stop shooting during @entity1 inspection these developments came as a top @entity4 official told @entity103 on sunday that the government would allow @entity1 inspectors full access to any site of a suspected chemical weapons attack			1
the agreement is effective immediately , deputy foreign minister @entity109 said			0
the @entity1 secretary - general 's office said inspectors hope to begin their investigation monday at the suspected chemical attack site			1
the @entity4 government has agreed to cease all hostilities as long as the @entity1 inspectors are on the ground			1
before sunday , @entity1 inspectors in @entity4 attempting to gather information were not allowed to visit the site of the recent attack			1
but one senior @entity123 administration official said the @entity4 government 's announcement was too little , too late			2
" if the @entity4 government had nothing to hide and wanted to prove to the world that it had not used chemical weapons in this incident , it would have ceased its attacks on the area and granted immediate access to the @entity1 -- five days ago , " the official said			1
" at this juncture , the belated decision by the regime to grant access to the @entity1 team is too late to be credible , including because the evidence available has been significantly corrupted as a result of the regime 's persistent shelling and other intentional actions over the last five days , " the official , who was not authorized to speak publicly , said in a statement			2
" based on the reported number of victims , reported symptoms of those who were killed or injured , witness accounts , and other facts gathered by open sources , the @entity7 intelligence community , and international partners , there is very little doubt at this point that a chemical weapon was used by the @entity4 regime against civilians in this incident			1
" the same senior @entity123 administration official said the @entity7 is " continuing to assess the facts so the president can make an informed decision about how to respond to this indiscriminate use of chemical weapons			1
" last year , while discussing the situation in @entity4 , president @entity123 said " a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized			2
" the @entity173 has sent four warships armed with cruise missiles to the region , and two key members of @entity7 congressional foreign affairs panels said sunday they expect the @entity7 to strike @entity4 after reports of chemical weapons attacks in that country			1
on friday , defense secretary @entity182 said the @entity7 military was providing @entity123 " with options for all contingencies , and that requires positioning our forces [ and ] positioning our assets to be able to carry out whatever options the president might choose			0
" jihadist group vows revenge meanwhile , the jihadist group @entity35 , which has ties to @entity195 , vowed sunday to avenge the suspected chemical attack by targeting villages populated by @entity4 's @entity199 minority , the sect to which @entity11 belongs			1
competing claims on chemical weapons use in @entity4 an audio message posted on @entity203 , purportedly from @entity35 leader @entity204 , accuses the @entity4 regime of bombarding eastern @entity206 " with tens of missiles " carrying a " suffocating chemical agent , " killing " hundreds of children , women and men			1
" " we are announcing a series of revenge operations called ' @entity215			0
' your @entity199 villages will pay a very dear price for every chemical rocket that you 've launched against our people			0
" according to @entity4 state - run television 's depiction of events , government forces came across the site of the gas attack when they entered the rebel stronghold of @entity229 on the edge of @entity15			2
the bodies of some of those killed in the attack early wednesday had been found there			0
several of the soldiers were " suffocating " from exposure to gases as they entered the city , according to state tv			0
" it is believed that the terrorists have used chemical weapons in the area , " @entity4 tv reported , citing an anonymous source			1
the government uses the term " terrorists " to describe rebel forces			0
broadcast video showed a room containing gas masks , gas canisters and other paraphernalia that could be used in a gas attack			0
the army said it uncovered the cache in a storage facility in @entity229			0
@entity103 could not independently confirm the authenticity of the video			0
" we said it from the first moment and , here , we assure again that we have never used chemical weapons ( around @entity229 ) or any other region in any form whatsoever -- ... liquid , gas or whatever , " information minister @entity267 said in an interview on @entity270 television			2
@entity4 's refugee children will be the ones to rebuild opposition accusations the rebels say that government forces fired rockets into the heavily populated civilian area			2
opposition spokesman @entity281 from the @entity282 claimed that some of the rockets delivered chemical payloads			0
more than 1,300 people were killed , most of them by gas , said @entity290 , another spokesman for the group			0
@entity292 said that medical teams in the affected area had administered 25,000 shots of atropine -- a medication used to treat people exposed to the nerve gas sarin -- after the attack			0
@entity301 said three hospitals it supports in @entity4 's @entity15 governorate reported having received some 3,600 patients displaying neurotoxic symptoms last wednesday morning			2
" the reported symptoms of the patients , in addition to the epidemiological pattern of the events -- characterized by the massive influx of patients in a short period of time , the origin of the patients , and the contamination of medical and first aid workers -- strongly indicate mass exposure to a neurotoxic agent , " said dr. @entity306 , director of operations			0
@entity322 showed rows of bodies without apparent injury , as well as people suffering convulsions or who appeared to be struggling to breathe			0
@entity103 could not verify where or when the videos were recorded , and could not confirm the number of casualties			0
