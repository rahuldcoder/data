-- @entity1 is doing all it can to respond to the oil leak in the @entity3 , a top @entity1 official said monday , even as criticism of the company 's handling of the crisis was growing			1
" we are going to clear every drop of oil off the shore , " @entity9 told reporters at @entity11 , @entity12 , where cleanup efforts were under way			1
" we will remediate any environmental damage and we will put the @entity21 right and back to normality as fast as we can			0
" the company 's next effort to plug the leak is to come at dawn wednesday			1
@entity1 plans to pump thick , viscous fluid twice the density of water into the site of the leak to stop the flow so the well can then be sealed with cement -- the " top kill " procedure			1
@entity9 , noting that the attempt will be carried out on the seafloor a mile below the sea surface , estimated the odds of success for the method at 60 percent to 70 percent			0
asked about the company 's continued use of an oil dispersant in the face of an @entity47 request that it use a less toxic alternative , @entity9 said , " everything that we do with dispersants is with the explicit approval of the @entity47			1
" but epa administrator @entity53 said she was not pleased with @entity1 's response to the government 's request			1
" the answer we got back from @entity1 , to me , seemed more like a defense of their current choice -- reminded me a little bit of that old commercial ' i 'd rather fight than switch , ' " she told reporters in @entity65 , @entity12			1
" we need to ask ourselves whether there 's not a better product out there			2
" federal officials told @entity1 that " we expect to see a substantial reduction in the overall amount of dispersant used , " from 50,000 gallons or more per day to less than 15,000 gallons per day , she said			1
that can be accomplished by releasing the dispersant below the surface of the water , she said			0
she said tests showed that the dispersant , @entity79 , was more toxic to baby shrimp and baby silverfish than were any of five other dispersants			0
coast guard commandant adm. @entity83 , the @entity85 administration 's point person in the @entity3 , called the decision to use dispersants a tradeoff			1
" it means we 're willing to accept the effect of the oil in the ocean rather than on land , " he said			0
@entity9 acknowledged that @entity1 's reputation has taken a beating , but said the company is being straightforward about its efforts			1
" we 're trying to communicate openly and transparently about everything that we 've done , " he said			0
as the environmental impact of the disaster was just beginning to unfold , he noted that @entity1 will set aside a half billion dollars to open a research program to study the effects of the spill			1
@entity9 's comments came a day after interior secretary @entity106 expressed frustration with the delay in stopping the spill , asserting that @entity1 has " from day one , frankly , not fulfilled the mission it was supposed to fulfill			1
" he said the company has missed " deadline after deadline " and that he was not confident that @entity1 knew what it was doing			1
" if we find that they 're [ @entity1 ] not doing what they 're supposed to be doing , we 'll push them out of the way , " @entity106 said			2
@entity1 chief operating officer @entity120 acknowledged monday that the federal government could take over the effort , but said the results would be no better			1
" i do n't think anyone else could do better than we are , " he said			0
if the " top kill " procedure does not work , he said , @entity1 will try to fit a second , smaller containment dome over the ruptured pipe , @entity120 said			2
a first containment dome failed to stop the leak			2
if the second dome does not work , he said , the company would " still have plenty of other options			2
" the company could try a " junk shot , " which would involve plugging the well with rubber and other substances , @entity1 managing director @entity135 said sunday			1
however , a permanent solution could take until august -- the estimated completion date for a relief well , said @entity83			0
by the time the runaway well is capped , the amount of oil discharged could be comparable to the total released in the @entity149 environmental disaster 20 years ago , @entity83 said			2
but he expressed no appetite for suggestions that the federal government should take over the project			0
" you need to do very technical work at 5,000 feet , " he said , referring to the depth of the leak			2
" you need equipment and expertise that 's not generally within the government -- federal government -- in terms of competency , capability or capacity			0
" the administration vowed to persevere			0
" we are going to be tireless in working to do everything we can to support the community and everybody whose livelihoods have been imperiled down in the region , " president @entity85 said at a reception celebrating @entity169 and @entity168			0
@entity177 commerce secretary @entity176 on monday declared a fishery disaster in the @entity3 because of the economic impact of the oil spill on fisheries in the region			1
the @entity183 has closed nearly 20 percent of the commercial and recreational fisheries in the area because of the spill , and @entity176 's declaration will allow the federal government to put additional resources into the @entity21 to soften the blow			1
meanwhile , @entity193 secretary @entity192 and @entity106 -- each on a fourth visit to the region since the april 20 spill began -- toured the spill area monday accompanied by a phalanx of politicians			0
" we are going to do everything we can to protect these lands , to protect these parishes , to make sure that claims are paid , " @entity201 told reporters in @entity203 , @entity12			2
read about @entity12 's closed oyster harvesting areas with an armada of more than 1,000 vessels and the efforts of more than 22,000 people who have put into place hundreds of thousands of feet of boom , the response to the oil spill is the largest in @entity177 history , said @entity201			1
that did not satisfy @entity12 gov. @entity220 , who called monday for more resources to be mobilized against the oil and reiterated his call for the @entity224 to move quickly to approve a plan to protect threatened marshland by building sand booms			1
" we 've got to take matters into our own hands if we are going to win this battle to protect our coast , " he said			0
" every day we are not dredging sand gives one more day for oil to enter the ecosystem			0
" he bemoaned the fact that nearly 70 miles of @entity12 coast has been hit by oil			2
read about a lawsuit filed by oil rig victims , families " @entity1 is the responsible party and we need the federal government to make sure they are held accountable , " he said			2
" our way of life depends on it			0
" @entity247 rear adm. @entity246 , the federal on - scene coordinator for the response effort , told reporters the barrier island project was under review			0
environmental and wildlife officials " are weighing in on the impact to endangered and threatened species , and other impacts this large - scale project could have , " she said			0
since the explosion aboard the @entity260 in late april about 40 miles off @entity12 , oil has been gushing into the @entity3 at an estimated rate of at least 5,000 barrels a day ( 210,000 gallons )			1
some estimates are far higher			0
eleven workers are missing and presumed dead after the sinking			0
the cause of the explosion has not been determined .			0
