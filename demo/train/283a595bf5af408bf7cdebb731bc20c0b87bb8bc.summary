-- lawyers for @entity2 wednesday asked that the federal trial of the suspected @entity5 bomber be moved to @entity6 in a motion filed with @entity10 @entity9 , lawyers for @entity2 , 20 , claimed that the defense team 's own venue survey revealed an " overwhelming presumption of guilt " in the state , prejudgment as to the potential penalty -- the prosecution is seeking the death penalty -- and an " extraordinary high number " of potential jurors who either attended or participated in the 2013 @entity5 or know someone who did			1
prosecutors said @entity2 and his brother planted bombs at the finish line of the 2013 race			1
@entity28 was killed during the manhunt that paralyzed @entity30 in the day the blasts			0
@entity2 pleaded not guilty to killing four people and wounding more than 200 in the attacks			1
defense lawyers said the " publicity , tremendous local impact and galvanizing community reaction " forced a change of venue in case against @entity38 , who was executed for his role in the 1995 @entity41 bombing that took 168 lives			1
" the community impact here is even greater than that present in @entity49 , given that the bombings occurred at the @entity5 on the day thousands of @entity51 and others from the region gathered to celebrate the runners , the @entity55 , and @entity56 , the indelible fear that friends and family could have been killed or injured , the trauma experienced by those in the region for four more days while the police sought the perpetrators , and the hundreds of thousands of @entity30 area residents who sheltered in place during the climactic final day of the search , " the motion said			0
" if a change of venue was warranted in @entity49 , it is even more compelled by the facts presented here			0
" defense lawyers surveyed the @entity74 in @entity75 and the federal court district in @entity6 , both of which are " reasonably close , accessible to witnesses and interested persons , and able to logistically accommodate a trial of this magnitude , " the motion said			1
@entity6 would be the more favorable location , it added			0
in @entity30 and @entity85 , @entity86 , the survey found that 57.9 % and 51.7 % of the respondents , respectively , said they believed the defendant was guilty , compared to 47.9 % and 37.4 % for @entity75 and @entity6			2
in addition , 37 % of the respondents in @entity30 and 35 % in @entity85 believed @entity2 should receive the death penalty			0
defense lawyers asked the court for more time to study the issue before the november trial date			2
also on wednesday , @entity10 district judge @entity96 in @entity86 heard arguments about whether @entity2 's alleged " betrayal " of the @entity10 was an aggravating factor for seeking the death penalty against him			1
a defense motion accused prosecutors of trying to use the suspect 's foreign birth and immigration to imply that he was " more blameworthy , and more deserving of severe punishment " than a native - born person who commits the identical crime			2
the government has said that part of @entity2 's motive " was to provide aid and comfort to @entity10 's enemies			0
" prosecutors also said that after @entity2 received asylum from the @entity10 , he " enjoyed the freedoms of a @entity10 citizen ; and then betrayed his allegiance to the @entity10 " by killing and maiming its people , according to court filing			2
@entity96 agreed with the defense , saying that drawing a distinction between naturalized and natural born citizens was " highly inappropriate			0

defense lawyers say it 's *impossible* to seat an *impartial* jury in @entity86
