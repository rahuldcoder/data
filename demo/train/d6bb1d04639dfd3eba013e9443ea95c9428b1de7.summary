@entity0 , @entity1 -- for the past eight months , close to 300 @entity4 soldiers have stood guard on a hillside overlooking one of @entity1 's largest cities , scanning the skies for the threat of missiles fired from nearby @entity12			1
the @entity4 men and women , wearing full battle armor and helmets under the hot september sun , operate a series of @entity20 missile launchers and radar stations , designed to hunt and shoot down incoming missiles			1
@entity23 reconfigured : @entity1 vs. @entity24 vs. @entity25 it is a @entity4 military " boots on the ground " deployment close to the @entity12 border that has been largely overlooked during the furious debate in @entity31 over whether to attack the @entity12 regime			1
" we 're protecting against any tactical ballistic missile or rocket attack that may come from the country of @entity12 , " said lt. col. @entity34 , commander of the @entity20 missile battalion originating from @entity36 , @entity37			1
" our presence here is to deter such an attack , and if that attack does come , to defeat any attack on our asset			0
" the " asset " is @entity0 , a fast - growing industrial city of 1.4 million inhabitants			1
this sprawling metropolis is about 30 miles from the @entity12 border and barely a two - hour drive from the northern @entity12 battlefield city of @entity54 , which has been the target of months of @entity12 government airstrikes and @entity58 surface - to - surface missile attacks			2
late last year , at the request of the @entity1 government , the @entity4 , @entity59 and the @entity60 agreed to send three @entity20 missile battalions to their @entity65 ally , to protect the @entity1 cities of @entity0 , @entity67 and @entity68			1
the decision was reached after a series of deadly cross-border incidents , during which the @entity1 government accused @entity12 government forces of killing @entity1 citizens with artillery and small arms fire			2
the possibility that chemical weapons were used on a massive scale in neighborhoods around @entity80 last week has only escalated the potential threat along the border , especially after the @entity12 government threatened retaliation against @entity4 allies @entity1 , @entity86 and @entity87 if it was targeted by an @entity4 attack			1
the @entity4 troops stationed in @entity0 say surface - to - surface missiles equipped with chemical warheads are weapons the @entity20 missile systems are designed to combat			1
" the nature of our branch ( of the military ) , air defense artillery , is that there is always a chemical threat , " said capt. @entity94 , a native of @entity95 , @entity96			0
lt. col. @entity34 added that the @entity20 missiles ' ability to destroy missiles armed with chemical weapons depended on many factors , including the quantity of poison on the warhead , the type of chemical agent and weather conditions			0
but , he added , " i 'm pretty sure we can mitigate most of that , if not all of that , based on certain conditions			0
" for laymen , @entity94 summed up the complicated advanced technology and physics behind the @entity20 system with a @entity126 video game analogy			0
" " we are able to engage missiles that are coming into the city , by shooting missiles out that are able to intercept it in the middle of the air , " he said			0
there are ample reasons why the @entity12 government would want to attack @entity0			2
tens -- if not hundreds -- of thousands of @entity12 refugees and exiles are believed to have settled here over the past two years			0
it is a key operations hub for international aid efforts to northern @entity12			0
but @entity0 is also an important rear base of operations for @entity12 opposition groups , who are supported and , in some cases , armed by the @entity1 government			2
the mission of the @entity4 troops deployed here is unusual because from their vantage point , they can see the city they have been assigned to protect			0
" this is the first time in my 18 - year career that we can see the asset that we 're defending , " said @entity34 , who gazed past rows of @entity20 missile launchers at the cityscape below			1
" it 's a special reward to also enjoy the view , while protecting the asset that we cover			0

close to 300 @entity4 soldiers protect @entity0 , an industrial city of 1.4 million people
they operate @entity20 missile launchers and radar stations near the @entity12 border
commander : " we 're protecting against " any @entity12 " tactical ballistic missile or rocket attack "
