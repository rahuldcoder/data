voices were heard chanting a prayer after a day of violent street battles in central @entity1			1
sustained automatic weapons fire , including from what sounded like a heavy machine gun , echoed around the square , the epicenter of nine days of protests calling for @entity7 's ouster			1
anti-government demonstrators hunkered down behind makeshift barricades in the square and outside the nearby national museum against the onslaught , which demonstrators said included plainclothes police officers			1
" they 're coming in with weapons			0
they 're spreading violence , " human rights activist @entity43 told @entity2 on wednesday			0
" we 've had peaceful protests here since friday and no violence here			0
only today were we faced with this really violent reaction			0
" the pro-government protesters were not impeded by the army when they entered the square , @entity2 's @entity50 said early thursday			1
anti-regime protesters are now unhappy with troops , whose commanders had promised monday not to use force against peaceful demonstrations , for standing by , he said			0

@entity0 's health ministry reported four people were killed and 829 were wounded in wednesday 's clashes , according to the state television network			1
reported fatalities in the previous eight days of demonstrations ranged as high as 300 , but @entity2 has not been able to independently confirm the death toll			0
in one surreal moment , whip - wielding @entity7 supporters thundered through the crowd astride horses and camels , and at least one man was pulled off his mount and beaten			2
a @entity7 supporter who spoke to @entity2 said the riders were pyramid workers who were protesting the negative economic impact of the crisis			0
" what you are seeing is the demonstration of the real @entity0 people who are trying to take back their country , trying to take back their street , " said businessman @entity81 , who described himself as " @entity82			1
" but some observers said the @entity91 push wednesday was likely orchestrated by a regime bent on breaking up peaceful demonstrations			2
" these are tactics that are well - known in @entity0 , " @entity94 , a senior associate at the @entity95 , told @entity2 's @entity96			1

as night fell , the sound of gunfire reverberated in @entity8 , the name of which means " liberation " in @entity115			2
people hurled verbal insults , @entity12 cocktails , rocks and anything else they could find -- shards of metal , sticks , shoes -- at one another			2
desperate for more ammunition , they dismantled sidewalks and picked up chunks of cement to throw			0

the 82 - year - old president 's announcement that night that he would spend the remaining seven months of his current term working to ensure a " peaceful transition of power " failed to satisfy them , and they vowed to keep up the pressure on him to resign			2
the crisis has paralyzed the @entity0 economy , as the government has closed banks , idled trains and shuttered schools			1

despite reports that shots had been fired , @entity191 's reporters denied any shooting had taken place or even that violence had broken out in @entity8			2
the network also said that members of the opposition @entity206 were heading to the square " to throw balls of fire and to start acts of riots and violence			2
" when asked if that were true , @entity212 , a spokesman for the @entity206 , said the action came from all segments of the @entity0 people , " not the @entity206 only			1
" @entity212 told @entity2 's @entity217 that the time for change is now , not when @entity7 's term ends			0
" we need a new era , a new regime , " @entity212 said			2

" our interactions within our country are @entity0 affairs and nothing more than that , " @entity243 spokesman @entity242 said			1
@entity0 " will continue to be a beacon of moderation and stability in our region , " he said , but its people must settle their differences without " intervention from the outside			1
" though @entity7 's concessions were large and remarkable for a man who has held a tight grip on power for three decades , it was too little , too late for many @entity0			1
" he is unfortunately going to continue the agony for another six or seven months , " opposition leader @entity262 said tuesday night			0
however , @entity7 supporter @entity264 told @entity2 that not all @entity0 agree that @entity7 should step down immediately			1
" @entity265 will not happen overnight			0
there 's not a magical button for change			0
@entity265 will take time , " he said			0
the @entity0 army ca n't sit on the sidelines too much longer , or it could risk unraveling , said a foreign policy expert			1
the army needs to pick a course of action by friday , when more mass protests are expected after prayers , @entity275 , president of the @entity276 , told @entity2 's " @entity281			0
