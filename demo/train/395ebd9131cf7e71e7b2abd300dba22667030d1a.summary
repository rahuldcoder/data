3 facts : we all get them			1
well , @entity7 one of the @entity9 has presented me with some hiccups			1
my hiccups started just before @entity13 ; my right knee started aching			1
disclaimer : i am 67			1
stuff happens ! the ache seemed to be no big deal			1
a little ibuprofen and i felt pretty good			1
i was still going to the gym , doing a little ( very little ) on my treadmill , and started swimming this january 7			1
i went to a sports medicine doctor on january 15 and was given naproxen , which worked very well			1
i was scheduled to return to the doctor february 5			1
kick - off weekend started on january 21			2
with my new painkiller friend , i was able to keep up with everything and loved every minute of it			2
i was a bit achy , but darn it , i was not going to let it affect this amazing time			2
plus , i did n't want it to show -- no big deal , the pain will go away			2
what a weekend -- it was amazing , awesome , really			2
like i tell people , it was like @entity13 , only with better workouts ! and i had fantastic teammates			1
january 25 , our last day together , we swam and then we hiked up @entity42			2
but as the old saying goes , " what goes up must come down			2
" there was no denying that my knee hurt			2
i figured it would go away , as all hiccups do ( see hiccup facts above )			2
there is no time for babying it			0
we had lunch and then a lovely ride to the airport with @entity1 's medical team			1
while on the flight on sunday , i started feeling an itchy area on the back of my leg			0
" it 's a bug bite , " i 'm thinking			1
next morning , it is large and red			0
tuesday morning , i awoke to snow			0
i checked the area on my leg and it was blistered			0
my mind went to " brown recluse spider bite			1
" everything was closed ( snow in @entity70 closes everything ) so i called a dear friend whose husband is a physician			0
he took one look at it and pronounced			0
" i was on meds by noon			0
but there was no swimming until the blistering was gone			0
ok , so i ca n't run and now i ca n't swim			1
doctors did an @entity84 on it january 28			0
since i am a nurse ( uh , with a few control issues ) , i always like to see the test results			1
they came in the mail january 30			0
i 'd had a gym / swim ( blisters gone ) morning and felt great , thanks to my buddy naproxen , and had been feeling happy			0
but the results that came in the mail , well : i have a large medial meniscus tear , @entity97 's cyst , enchondroma ( a benign cartilage tumor )			0
oh yeah , the hiccups just got real			0
i emailed the @entity101 team managers			1
" stay calm , " they told me , " we 'll get through this			0
the good news in all this : it 's week 1 and , like all hiccups , this will go away			0
i foresee doctor visits in my future and maybe a " procedure , " but these hiccups will go away			0

at 67 , @entity113 is the oldest *person* to have ever *joined* the @entity101 team
the *semiretired* *psychiatric* nurse kept busy looking after people in her *job* and in her family , and paid *limited* attention to her own *health*
a *mud* run *inspired* her to want to train for a *triathlon* " i 'm a *triathlete* in my mind . *...* i want to make it a reality "
