@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 police are hunting for a man they believe broke into the homes of four former members of the same sorority , then sexually assaulted them			1
the alleged attacks took place over a span of months , and occurred in the @entity1 cities of @entity0 , @entity12 and @entity13 , according to police			2
no one has been named yet as a suspect , though @entity0 police last week released a video -- dated in april -- showing a man they believe is responsible for all four assaults			1
the alleged victims -- all black females in their mid- 50s to mid- 60s -- offered similar descriptions of their assailant as a stout , black male in his late 30s to mid- 40s			1
and all were alumnae of the same sorority : @entity28			1
" he made it obvious to our victims that he knew information ... about them personally , " said @entity0 police spokesman @entity29 , adding that none of the women believe they knew their attacker in advance			1
while ceding the sorority membership is a " common denominator " of all four cases , @entity29 cautioned against assuming that the accused attacker had only targeted this sorority 's alumnae			1
" we do n't want to give a false sense of security to any other group that 's out there , " he said			0
according to @entity52 capt. @entity51 , all the assaults occurred in " residential settings " between 9:15 p.m. and 4 a.m. when the victims were alone			2
the alleged attack in his city , 35 miles northwest of @entity58 , took place on october 14			0
the late - night setting , the fact the victims were often asleep and the alleged assailant 's " attempts to conceal his identity " make it challenging to definitively identify the attacker , said @entity51			1
he noted that the @entity13 police department is currently processing dna evidence , as are other police departments			0
still , @entity51 said that the suspect 's physical traits -- weighing from 275 to 300 pounds and between 5 - foot - 7 and 5 - foot - 9 tall , in his department 's estimation , and balding or with a close - shaven head -- were common , as were other characteristics like what he called the man 's distinctive " swagger " as shown in the video			2
police described the video as coming from a surveillance camera , but they did not describe the specific source or location			2
" there are some things ... that stick out -- his size , the glasses , the mannerism with which he walks , " added @entity29			0
" we know somebody knows ( him ) ... we just hope that they give us a call , so we can put a stop to this			0
" @entity51 said that the nature of the assaults suggests the assailant was " possibly suspecting surveillance , spending some time around the areas ... prior to the attacks			0
" the police captain added authorities do not know how the suspect learned details of the victims , speculating it may have been over the internet , by accessing an old directory or noticing would - be victims with @entity28 jewelry , placards or other paraphernalia out in public			1
" we want them to understand that their group is being targeted , " @entity51 said of the sorority 's alumnae , urging them " not to advertise " their affiliation with @entity28 and advising those who live alone to stay with a relative or friend until the case is resolved			1
" ( but ) we do n't want to create any pandemonium			0
" the sorority 's @entity130 - based headquarters , in a statement monday , urged all its members in the @entity58 area to take precautions			0
" to think that our members are being targeted is disturbing and extremely disheartening , " said @entity135 , @entity28 's president			0
" until the individual responsible for these crimes is brought to justice , we will continue to remain in close communication with one another and law enforcement officials			0
