a company in @entity1 reportedly used giant @entity3 printers to make 10 houses in one day			1
this leads to two obvious questions			0
first , how big were those printers ? the answer is : 10 meters wide by 6.6 meters high			2
a mixture of cement and construction waste were sprayed to build the walls layer by layer			0
and second , if 3 - d printers could be used to create a neighborhood of full - sized , detached single family homes in less time and money than it would conventionally take , could @entity3 printers help end homelessness ? i 'm not pollyanna - ish when it comes to ending poverty			1
many of the world 's problems stem from decades of government policies that fostered inequality and neglect , dynamics that can not be easily fixed by one solution			0
at the same time , i 'm completely obsessed with 3 - d printers , probably because i do n't fully understand them , so they seem like magic sent to us from the future by @entity38			1
if these printers can make even a dent in some of the world 's most pressing challenges , they would be even cooler in my book			2
so , what major social and economic problems might we potentially print our way out of ? here are some possibilities			0
hunger at @entity50 this year , i got to eat candy that came out of a printer , courtesy of the folks at @entity55			0
last fall , writer @entity56 documented in the @entity57 an entire meal he and his wife ate that was produced by @entity3 printers , including pizza , pasta and dessert			2
while @entity56 needed the help of several companies and their @entity69 staff to produce his meal , on @entity71 , one startup tried to get funding for the " @entity74 food printer for home chefs			0
for now , the technology is too expensive , and like many trends the exploration is happening more in high - end settings ( @entity3 printed caviar , anyone ? )			1
but as the costs come down and the technology improves , could there be a @entity3 printer making nutritious food in every village around the globe ? perhaps			2
homelessness it 's quite a feat for the @entity1 company to build 10 homes in one day , but they 're not the only innovators			1
earlier this year , professor @entity95 at the @entity96 built a giant 3 - d printer that can produce a basic house in one day			1
and in @entity100 , construction has begun on what appears to be the first multistory -- and aesthetically pleasing -- @entity3 printed house			1
of course , homelessness is far more complex than simply a lack of housing			0
but the ability to create " affordable housing " even more affordably would not only help homeless people but also low - income individuals			0
disease i understand stem cells even less than i understand @entity3 printing , so i 'm not going to say much here except to note that scientists are experimenting with what seems to be impossible but apparently is n't : printing human organs			1
@entity119 reported on how bioprinters use an " ink " of stem cells to print 3 - d shapes that can be placed into the human body , where hopefully the cells will be accepted by the existing tissues			1
@entity127 has a lot of potential			0
in 2013 , a little girl born without a windpipe got one thanks to a 3 - d printer that rendered one out of the girl 's own stem cells			2
a foundation has created a $ 1 million prize to be awarded to whomever comes up with the first @entity3 printed functioning liver , which would be a big deal to the 17,000 @entity140 waiting for liver transplants â€” and a huge sign of hope to millions of people worldwide with all kinds of organ needs because of diseases and conditions			1
pollution there are many causes of climate change , one of which is pollution from industrial production			0
3 - d printing offers many promising alternatives to more traditionally wasteful and dirty manufacturing methods			1
rather than having to throw out entire products when one piece needs replacing ( " planned obsolescence " ) , @entity3 printing will make it easier to replace parts			2
even complex products can be produced and assembled locally rather than shipped from across the continent , which would reduce the carbon footprint			0
( the raw materials will need to be shipped , but they take up less room			0
) money printing money is as illegal in three dimensions as it is in two			0
and while 3 - d printing may never eliminate the need for money , it may change the demand for it			1
think about how the @entity180 reduced the cost of information or how @entity183 has reduced the cost of music			0
or how cell phones are prevalent all over the world			0
imagine years into the future when 3 - d printers are just as affordable and available as cell phones			1
communities could meet their basic needs -- not just for food but everyday items -- with far less money			0
imagine a 3 - d printer making plates and cups and toothbrushes and hammers and nails and much more for entire communities , to be shared or bartered for rather than purchased with cash			2
and for goods that are bought and sold , 3 - d printing could maybe reduce costs without affecting production wages ( i 'm looking at you , @entity210 )			1
the possibilities are so exciting that the @entity212 has considered the implications of 3 - d printing for reducing poverty and sharing prosperity			1
let 's hope @entity3 printing will truly be as revolutionary as we hope .			2

@entity226 printers have potential to address problems like hunger , pollution
she says scientists are even experimenting with printing human tissues , organs
@entity237 : millions worldwide can *benefit* from @entity3 printed houses or foods
