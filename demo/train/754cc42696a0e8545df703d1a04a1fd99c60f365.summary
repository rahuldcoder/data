-- while @entity2 is busy pushing a smaller tablet to take on @entity1 and @entity5 's 7 - inch offerings , @entity1 is thinking big			1
the company has teamed up with @entity7 for the new @entity9 tablet , a direct competitor to the full - size ipad			1
the @entity9 is a solid entry into the category , with excellent hardware and a stunning screen			0
it comes in two models and prices : the @entity19 version is $ 399 , and the @entity21 tablet costs $ 499			1
@entity22 : @entity1 unveils new @entity9 tablets and phone the tablet does n't go on sale til november 13 , but we got our hands on one early			1
here are our impressions : what 's inside the real selling point of any tablet it its operating system			1
and if you 've ever read the comments on a gadget article , you know that people feel very strongly about which os and ecosystem is the best			0
@entity2 's intuitive @entity41 -- the system running on iphones and @entity44 -- has dominated the market , but competition has cropped up over the years			1
@entity1 's @entity48 system has had some issues , but it 's been slowly improving with each release			1
now @entity51 is in the ring with @entity53 , whose tablet system is a refreshing and fun entry that could win over new users			1
the @entity9 is running a new version of @entity1 's operating system , @entity48 4.2 ( still called @entity60 )			1
this new update packs some subtle improvements and fun surprises , although it still catches in a few spots , such as built - in apps getting stuck on simple tasks			1
the main screen is easily customizable			0
tap on the middle button on the dock to bring up a grid of all apps , then arrange them any way you like on one of the multiple lock screens , or keep them tucked away in the application view			0
there are widgets you can add to the background , like interactive photo albums and the weather			0
in the top left corner is a drop - down list of notifications , and settings are in the top right			1
the new @entity48 has a swipe - typing feature , so you can drag your finger around the on - screen keyboard to spell a word , only taking your finger off the screen between words			1
searching is front and center on the @entity9 , with multiple places to start a search either by typing or speaking a request			0
the @entity104 feature shows " cards " below the search bar , populated with information it thinks is relevant to you , such as nearby restaurants or public transit schedules			0
it also can now pull key information , like a flight itinerary , straight from your e-mail account			0
one of the most exciting new features is support for multiple users			0
unlike a smartphone , a tablet can get passed around the family or office			2
having separate profiles is a great feature that other tablet makers will hopefully pick up soon			2
( the @entity127 and @entity128 8 devices have kids ' modes , but adults share gadgets , too			0
) there are many options for customizing the tablets ' settings and appearance , and if you 're not careful the end result can be a messy and overly confusing interface			0
if @entity2 is a strict parent who claims to know what 's best for you , @entity1 is the cool uncle who lets you eat ice cream and finger paint on the new sofa			1
ecosystem tablets are tools that companies can use to sell you more content , apps and services			0
@entity5 is able to sell its $ 199 @entity157 for such a low price because the company makes its money by selling users books , movies , tv shows , apps and even physical goods through the device			2
@entity2 makes gobs of money off content in the @entity170 , books and apps			1
@entity1 is no exception , which means there 's a subtle sales pitch lurking around every corner			1
the @entity178 store surfaces when you first open the @entity9 10 , showing you a selection of books and magazines in the middle of the main screen ( the first ones are free , you see )			2
apps for reading books , listening to music , reading magazines and watching movies are all extensions of the play store			0
@entity1 is so excited about how nice magazines will look on the @entity195 ' high - res screen that it 's included two separate apps for looking at them : currents and @entity199			1
( in another example of needless doubling up of apps , there is a @entity205 app and an email app. ) the @entity9 would also really like you to have an account for @entity209 , the company 's social network			2
what 's outside the physical designs of tablets have been somewhat unified since @entity2 's @entity44 set the standard in 2010			1
today 's tablets are thin , usually black rectangles whose fronts are dominated by a touchscreen , with minimal buttons and ports scattered around the edges			2
@entity1 and @entity7 have tried to give the form their own spin			1
the @entity9 is all black , with rounded corners and a familiar sheet of @entity228 covering the entire front side , including the 10 - inch screen and its black border			1
there 's a mic jack , a micro @entity235 port and a micro-usb charging port			2
( for people juggling multiple gadgets , it 's always a relief when a new addition sticks with the nonproprietary @entity244 option			2
) the back is coated in a rubbery textured material that gives it a pleasingly sturdy feel , and the smooth shape makes it easy to hold			0
to some it might feel cheap , but the extra grip actually makes the device seem less precious and more usable , like a case is n't necessary to protect it from damage			0
the optional front cover should suffice for keeping the important bit -- that big smooth screen -- safe from scratches			0
and it 's a fighting weight : just 1.33 pounds , slightly lighter than the full - size @entity44 's 1.44 pounds			1
screen and speed turn on the @entity9 and its bright , vivid hd screen blocks out the rest of the design			0
in the battle of specs , @entity1 just inched in above @entity2 in the screen resolution department			1
the screen quality is key for this size of tablet			1
ten - inch tablets are often media consumption devices , so movies and photos need to look crisp and vivid			1
they 're also being bought as a replacement for laptops , so this monitor needs to be good enough to work and play on			0
the @entity9 delivers with a killer screen			0
the 2560 - by - 1600 screen packs in 300 pixels per inch ( compared to the newer @entity44 's 264 pixels per inch )			1
movies and tv shows are rendered in full 1080p			2
a beautiful screen is no good without speedy graphics , and luckily the @entity9 has a powerful dual - core @entity290 processor			2
cameras taking a photo with a tablet is odd , but as the saying goes , the best camera is the one you have with you			2
if all you have is an unwieldy rectangle with which to capture a moment , the @entity9 10 's back camera is a fine pick			1
it has a flash and can capture 5 - megapixel images and shoot 1080p videos			2
tablets are fantastic tools for video chatting , but the front camera always gets cheated on specs			0
the @entity9 is no exception			0
its front - facing camera has no flash and captures 1.9 megapixel images and 720p videos			2
the camera hardware is average , but there are some nice touches in the software			0
the view is clutter free when you 're composing a shot , but tap anywhere on the screen and a nifty control dial appears that lets you adjust settings such as exposure compensation , scene mode , white balance and flash			0
in the gallery view , you can do detailed edits , including the option to instantly @entity333 - ize your images by adding filters and borders			0
the final touch is the panorama mode			0
there 's the regular rectangular pano mode , which can capture and stitch together 360 - degree images			1
but the winner is the photo sphere mode , which can go in all directions to capture a complete , street view-esque image of your surroundings .			0

@entity1 's new 10 - inch tablet is a direct competitor to @entity2 's full - size @entity44
the @entity19 version will cost $ 399 and the @entity353 version $ 499
it will be running a new version of @entity48 's @entity60 operating system
the tablet goes on sale november 13
