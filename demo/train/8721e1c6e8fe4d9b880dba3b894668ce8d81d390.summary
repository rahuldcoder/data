what does one buy a woman who 's worth an estimated $ 500 million and reportedly owns a sixth of the planet 's land surface ? tip -- make it something equine related			2
given her well - known love of horses , it 's perhaps fitting -- some might say unimaginative -- that the majority of gifts presented to @entity16 from world leaders last year revolved her favorite four - legged animals			1
dog lovers look away now -- her majesty 's iconic pet corgis did n't even get a look in			2
included in the 2014 list of gifts was a mounted sculpture of a white horse from @entity28 's president @entity27 ; a bronze sculpture of a horse 's head from the emir of @entity33 ; and another bronze statuette of the famous @entity36 thoroughbred , @entity37 from the president of @entity39 , @entity38 , along with a book of the same name			1
a dressage crop from the governor general of @entity44 , @entity45 , and a boot scraper from @entity47 in the east of @entity49 can also be put to good use at @entity16 's stud farm on the royal @entity52			1
among the more peculiar gifts given to the @entity16 was a miniature seven - inch throne from the " @entity56 " tv series , during a visit to @entity39 in june			1
however , it 's far from the most outlandish present bestowed upon the monarch			0
during her 62 - year - long reign , the @entity16 has received a jaguar from @entity63 , two giant turtles from the @entity65 , an elephant from @entity67 , and several horses -- most notably a beloved black mare called " @entity70 " from the @entity71			2
indeed , the @entity16 rode " @entity70 " at the traditional @entity72 for 18 consecutive years , and in 2005 unveiled a bronze statue of herself atop the horse outside the @entity75 in @entity44			0
but what happens to the many gifts her majesty receives throughout the year that are n't to her taste ? live animals are donated to @entity82 , perishable items such as food and flowers are given to local hospices , and all other presents which do n't go on display in the royal residencies are stored at the @entity90 at @entity91 , a @entity93 spokesperson told @entity1			1
some items are even loaned to galleries , such as a @entity97 canoe given by the @entity99 government which is now on display at the @entity100			0
when it comes to royal presents , the @entity16 's great - grandson @entity101 recorded the largest haul in 2014			1
during a tour of @entity109 and @entity99 with his parents , the @entity106 and @entity107 , the toddler received a surfboard , skateboard , possum skin cloak , and more soft toys than other children would get in a lifetime of @entity117			1
fittingly , the previous year @entity101 also received a teddy wearing the same silk jacket as those worn by the @entity16 's jockeys , from promotional group @entity122			1
will the young prince also inherit a love of horse racing passed down through the centuries ? indeed , legend has it @entity16 @entity129 became so excited while watching a race at @entity131 one time , that she broke the window of the @entity133 in a rush to see the finish			0
@entity16 was more contained than her great great grandmother -- though still visibly delighted -- when her own horse " estimate " won @entity141 's prestigious @entity140 race in 2013			0
so what would one buy for the horse racing - mad monarch , that has n't been bought before ? " the ultimate gift would be a ' nomination ' to @entity153 or @entity154 , the two most expensive stallions in the world , " said @entity146 from @entity122 , of the chance to mate a mare with some of the most prized stallions on the planet			0
" a mare mating with @entity154 , including a live foal guarantee , would cost someone Â£ 125,000 ( $ 187,000 )			0
" at that price , it 's a gift fit for a queen			2
feature : @entity16 's horseman tames ... zebra ? culture : @entity167 transformed into equine art			0
