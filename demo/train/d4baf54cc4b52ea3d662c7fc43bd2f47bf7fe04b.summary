@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's prime minister , @entity3 , on monday defended his government , saying there is no reason @entity8 - style protests should take off in the country			1
" @entity1 is not @entity10 or @entity8 , " he said			1
" @entity1 has its own different situation ... @entity1 is a democratic country			2
through all the stages , elections took place			0
and therefore this is a democratic regime			0
" he accused opposition parties of " trying to duplicate what happened in @entity10 and @entity8 , and act as if it should be imposed on the people here in @entity1			1
" last thursday , thousands of anti-government demonstrators gathered near @entity22 in @entity1 's capital			2
people of all ages chanted and held signs with messages against poverty and the government			0
many not only expressed solidarity with the uprisings in @entity10 and @entity8 but also demanded that @entity1 's president , @entity32 , who has been in office for 32 years , needed to step down			1
while the protests in recent weeks in @entity1 have been on a smaller scale than in @entity10 and @entity8 , analysts say that @entity1 protesters are seeking many of the same things -- particularly a government that they feel represents them and that will provide them with more economic opportunities			1
president @entity32 recently announced that he would not seek re-election in 2013 , after more than three decades in office , and wo n't install his son to replace him			1
he also has asked his political opponents " to re-engage in dialogue in hopes of reaching a sustainable and reconcilable political agreement , " the @entity1 government said			2
prime minister @entity3 said that if the opposition responds negatively to the president 's initiative , " democratic life in @entity1 will continue because it does not rely only on the opposition of ' joint meeting parties			1
' we have the people of @entity1 who want to see the implementation of their constitutional entitlements through parliamentary elections			0
" asked whether political turmoil in @entity1 could benefit @entity62 , @entity3 responded , " absolutely -- everything is possible			0
those extremists who are in @entity1 found a suitable environment where there is poverty and unemployment			0
" by the way , they also take advantage of @entity1 's terrain , which is complex and difficult -- it is mountainous and has widespread desert areas , " he added			0
" they are now spread in rural areas and therefore , the size of their attacks are not frequent and they happen at specific times in the cities			0

@entity1 saw a large anti-government demonstration last week
" @entity1 is not @entity10 or @entity8 , " says the prime minister
analysts : @entity1 protesters seek many of the same things as other demonstrators
