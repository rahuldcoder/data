@entity0 , @entity1 -- serving @entity1 's financial capital , @entity3 is one of the world 's busiest international gateways			1
with 56 million passengers passing through last year , it 's the third busiest airport in @entity10 and claims to serve more international destinations than any other airport in the world			1
but rather than just catering to holiday makers , @entity0 is a major logistical hub			1
most of its passengers are business travelers and more than half of all passengers are there to transfer between flights			0
it handles more than 2 million tons of cargo each year , as well as 100 million animals			1
and more than 18,000 items of baggage travel along its 73 kilometers of conveyor belts every hour			0
see also : record - breaking airports " what is unique about @entity0 is the amount of traffic , " @entity31 , supervisor at @entity0 control tower , told @entity2 's @entity33			2
he added : " we have four runways , we have two terminals , divided in different parts , so we have a lot of taxiing aircraft , which is very complex			0
" @entity0 is a transfer hub so we have several peak hours a day -- inbound peaks , outbound peaks -- so punctuality is a big issue here			1
" the airport was also considered the first to have infrastructure compatible with the colossal @entity50 -- the biggest passenger aircraft flying today			2
it can take up to 50 people to handle the turnaround of an @entity50 and the double - deck plane presents considerable challenges for the airport 's staff			1
it takes about an hour to refuel an @entity50 , which can guzzle up to about 320,000 liters of fuel -- enough to fill the tanks of some 6,000 cars			0
and a single @entity50 can require up to 1,200 in - flight meals -- prepped and cooked by the airport 's chefs			1
feeding @entity3 and its airlines is no small task			2
international chefs work around the clock to dish out an average of 100,000 meals a day -- enough to feed the population of a small city			1
while most meals for economy class are deep frozen , for business and first - class passengers food is freshly prepared on the day			2
but preparing food for consumption in the air presents unique problems -- not least that passengers ' taste buds do n't function as well at altitude			0
@entity86 , section manager of @entity87 , a catering company at @entity3 , says its hard to create plane food that is n't plain			1
" the challenge is to make good food ... because if you fly the air is dry , and you ca n't taste the salt , " he said			0
" so you have to work with more herbs or other spices			0
" and his secret to pleasing fussy airline passengers ? " all the ingredients are very fresh , " he said			0
" we check the temperature , we check the freshness , we check everything because it must be the freshest you get , because on the airplane , you ca n't say ' oh sorry , tell the chef i want another one			0
' there 's just one chance to deliver good food on a plane			0
