editor 's note : @entity2 is the author of " voting rights -- and wrongs : the @entity6 , " published this month by the @entity5			1
she is the vice-chairwoman of the @entity8 and an adjunct scholar at the @entity5			0

@entity2 says ethnic and racial politics have n't faded away with the election of @entity14			1
( @entity15 ) -- some of us thought the election of @entity14 as president might signal a fading away of the old identity politics			1
the assumption that fundamental lines of division in politics are set by race and ethnicity would seem to be a bit pass√© when 43 percent of white voters cast their ballots for a proudly " post-racial " @entity30			2
but the president himself has made identity politics front - page news with his selection of judge @entity34 as his @entity36 nominee			1
she played an important role in the @entity41 firefighters ' case ( @entity38 ) now awaiting decision by the @entity36			1
@entity34 and two colleagues simply brushed aside the important constitutional and statutory questions raised by the city 's decision to discard the results of a race - neutral test given to applicants for promotions within the department			1
too many men of the " wrong " color had passed it -- that is , all of those who scored highest were white except for one @entity57			0
those firefighters had worked hard to get the test results they did ; the lead plaintiff , @entity38 , is dyslexic , but he had been on the force for 11 years and was determined to become a lieutenant , so he paid an acquaintance more than $ 1,000 to read textbooks onto audiotapes and make flash cards			0
@entity67 gave up his second job in order to study long hours -- and aced the test			0
president @entity14 , in his famous @entity71 , @entity72 , race speech during the campaign , said that when whites hear " that an @entity30 is getting an advantage in landing a good job or a spot in a good college because of an injustice that they themselves never committed ... resentment builds over time			2
and when firefighters are denied promotions they earned simply because they are white , resentment builds			0
discarding that test has struck many as an instance of racial preferences run amok			2
will the real @entity14 please stand up ? did he mean to imply in that @entity71 speech that the " empathy " he claims to celebrate extends not only to minority victims of injustice , but also to whites ? and is he a man who remains eager to move beyond identity politics , as he suggested numerous times in the course of his campaign -- or not ? questions abound			1
he has tried to downplay @entity34 's now infamous declaration that " i would hope that a wise @entity107 woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who has n't lived that life , " suggesting that it was nothing more than a poor choice of words			1
but in the same speech , @entity34 wondered " whether by ignoring our differences as women or men of color we do a disservice both to the law and society			2
" and , most remarkably , she stated : " whether born from experience or inherent physiological or cultural differences ... our gender and national origins may and will make a difference in our judging			0
" " inherent physiological or cultural differences " ? can the president possibly believe that @entity107 women -- and indeed minority women in general -- are born to see questions of law in a different and better light than white men or even men of color ? it 's in their physiological and cultural makeup			2
if indeed the president believes in such disturbing racial determinism , weep for our nation			0
either the president is a man of many parts , untroubled by his own conflicting views , or he is an immensely skilled and coldly calculating politician who is eager to court the @entity57 vote and knows that few senators are likely to vote against a " first			0
" identity politics is on the line in @entity67 and also in another forthcoming @entity36 decision , a key case involving minority voting rights			1
later this month , the @entity36 will decide whether in 2009 , black candidates for public office can win running in majority - white settings			1
at issue in " @entity158 " is the constitutionality of a key , temporary provision of the @entity162 that was renewed for the fourth time in 2006 on the theory that voting discrimination had just become " more subtle " than it was four decades earlier			0
the renewal meant that the @entity166 could continue to insist on districting maps that were carefully racially gerrymandered to elect black and @entity57 candidates			0
legislative quotas have been the remedy for persistent racial exclusion -- seats reserved for candidates who are the choice of minority voters			0
but is @entity176 still a nation steeped in the muck of old - fashioned racism -- the results of the 2008 election notwithstanding ? are we condemned to identity politics in choosing firefighters for promotion , in drawing districting maps for legislative bodies ( from school boards all the way up to congressional delegations ) , and in a multitude of other spheres into the indefinite future ? @entity34 's nomination suggests that the answer will be yes			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : there were hopes ethnic politics would fade after @entity14 's win
she says nomination of @entity34 *rekindled* racial and ethnic *debate*
@entity2 : two *pending* @entity36 cases also raise identity politics issues
