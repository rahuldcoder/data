in the aftermath of dramatic events like monday 's bombing attack at the @entity4 , it 's a truth of our times that millions of people will get early bits of news via social media			1
to be sure , sites like @entity12 and @entity13 were used extensively by police , relief groups and governments to share important information about the bombings			1
but there 's also a more unfortunate side to how the @entity21 responds to sudden bad news			2
sometimes accidentally and sometimes maliciously , false information gets loose			2
and in the rapid - fire digital echo chamber , it does n't take long to spread			1
" on days like this , @entity12 shows its best & worst : loads of info at huge speed , but often false & sometimes deliberately so , " said @entity30 , of the @entity31 , in a post on the site			1
as always , news discovered online ( or anywhere else , really ) should be double - checked before it 's passed along -- especially in times of tragedy			1
here are some of the most widely shared untrue news items we 've found on social media in the past 24 hours			1
man planned to propose , girlfriend killed among the many gripping images to emerge from the bombing 's aftermath was one of a man in a red shirt , kneeling on the ground cradling a woman in his arms			1
it went viral -- with a heartbreaking , but fake , story attached			1
" the man in the red shirt planned to propose to his girlfriend as he crossed the finish line of the @entity4 , but she passed away " it reads			1
" most of us will never experience this amount of emotional pain			2
" the image is , in fact , real			2
it comes from the @entity67 and was shared through @entity68			0
but the agency 's caption merely describes the scene as a man comforting an injured woman at the finish line			1
that did n't stop it from making the rounds in a big way			2
a somewhat misleading @entity13 account pretending to represent actor @entity80 ( it calls itself a " parody " but has 385,000 likes ) shared the post			0
by tuesday morning , the picture had more than 448,000 " likes " and had been shared over 92,000 times			0
young girl died at finish line another heart - wrenching image of a supposed victim went viral			2
in this one , a young girl running in a road race is pictured , with text saying she died in one of the blasts			0
as an added cruel twist , the post says she was " running for the @entity99 victims			0
" but a quick look at the photo shows that her runner 's bib is from the @entity105 in @entity106 , @entity107			1
also , the @entity4 does not allow runners that young			0
on @entity112 , one of the users who shared the image followed it with " poor little girl			0
. got killed in boston			0
. ) : " by tuesday , it had more than 500 comments and had become a " what 's hot " post on the site -- appearing in the feeds of all users who have n't turned off that feature			2
on tuesday , organizers of that race shot down the tale on their @entity13 account			0
" we would like to clarify that the picture circulating on the web and @entity12 of a little girl wearing a @entity105 bib claiming to have been killed at the @entity4 is being used fraudulently , " read the page for the @entity130			1
the group raises funds for the families of children who are ill in the @entity140 area			0
race organizers will donate for retweets a @entity12 account sprouted up under the handle @ _ @entity145			1
posing as the organizers of the race , whoever is behind the account tweeted : " for every retweet we receive we will donate $ 1 to the # @entity145 victims # @entity149			0
" by monday evening , the post had been retweeted more than 50,000 times			0
it was , of course , fake			0
and to its credit , @entity12 disabled the account soon afterward			1
it was n't the only @entity12 phony			1
another widely talked - about account , @ @entity159 , shared both the image of the 8 - year - old girl who supposedly died and a photo of a young boy , running in a race , who was another supposed victim			2
eight - year - old @entity166 was one of three confirmed fatalities as of tuesday morning			0
but he was watching the race , not running in it			0
the " @entity171 " account was created on march 24 , according to the @entity21 tool when did you join @entity12 ? but account holders are able to change their handles and names on the site			1
authorities shut down cell phone service reports flew around social media , mainly @entity12 , on monday that police in @entity183 had shut down cellular networks to prevent an attacker from using a cell phone to detonate another explosive			1
at least one media report quoted an unnamed source with information to that effect , before later recanting			2
in truth , @entity183 's wireless network was simply overwhelmed with the volume of calls and other communications in the aftermath of the attack			1
service was slow and spotty , but never shut down			1
@entity199 and other mobile carriers confirmed they 'd never been contacted by officials asking them to shut off service			1
soon after the bombings , mobile carriers were beefing up their networks in the @entity183 area			1
@entity207 made its @entity209 system publicly available for free to help take the load off traditional phone lines			2
conspiracy theories we almost hate to even address this stuff			0
we 'll start with a bottom line : anyone saying they know what happened at this point is making it up			0
but that did n't stop far - fetched imaginings , often based in political ideology , from flying almost immediately after the attack			2
one syndicated talk show host ( who wo n't be named and whose content wo n't be linked here ) tweeted that the attacks " stink to high heaven " of a so - called " false flag , " or staged attack			1
" false flag " is an old naval term that 's come to be used for a military action that 's not what it appears to be			0
at least one web user was ready for this			0
he registered a website -- bostonmarathonconspiracy.com -- on monday			0
clicking the link reveals a white page with black text reading : " i bought this domain to keep some conspiracy theory kook from owning it			0
please keep the victims of this event and their families in your thoughts			0

on social media , untrue stories about the @entity183 terror attacks have gone viral quickly
one photo falsely purported to show a man who had planned to propose to his girlfriend
people *believed* cell phone service was shut down by authorities , but it was n't
tragedy shows " best and worst " of @entity12 , media professional says
