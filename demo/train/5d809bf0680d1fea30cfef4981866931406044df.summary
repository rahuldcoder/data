@entity0 -- the @entity2 wednesday notified @entity3			1
@entity4 , a prime suspect in the @entity6 case , that he now faces 22 more charges in connection with allegedly downloading secret information from computers in @entity11			1
the most serious new charge alleges that he aided the enemy by making this information public			0
that charge is punishable by death			0
a news release from the @entity2 said the prosecution team " has notified the defense that the prosecution will not recommend the death penalty , " but technically it is up to the commander overseeing the case to make the final decision about the death penalty			2
all told , @entity4 , a military intelligence analyst from @entity25 , now faces a total of 34 charges in the case , including : -- wrongfully causing intelligence to be published on the internet -- theft of public records -- transmitting defense information -- transferring classified data onto his personal computer -- disclosing classified information concerning the national defense			1
@entity4 's lawyer , @entity38 , would not comment on the new charges , but posted a statement on his blog wednesday evening : " over the past few weeks , the defense has been preparing for the possibility of additional charges in this case			1
" @entity46 military officials have said that @entity4 is the prime suspect in the leak of many thousands of classified documents that ended up on the @entity6 website			2
however , @entity6 is not mentioned in the charge sheets			0
last august , @entity38 said he 'd seen no evidence tying @entity4 to the @entity6 case			2
even though the investigators filed the new charges , there are still several legal steps that would be taken before any decision will be made on which charges , if any , @entity4 would actually face in a court - martial			1
one of those steps involves determining @entity4 's mental capacity			1
that step is expected to take two to six more weeks			0
manning is currently being held in the brig at @entity66 south of @entity0 there has been a push by friends and supporters to have the rules about his confinement conditions eased			0
they say his confinement , in a one - man cell with only one hour a day outside of the cell for exercise , is unfair .			0
