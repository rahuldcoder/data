do get some benefit even as their symptoms worsen , a new study suggests			0
while the drug is approved for all stages of the memory - robbing disease , many people stop taking it			1
as a patient 's memory and behavior problems get more severe , it can be hard to tell if the benefit of the treatment outweighs the risk of side effects , such as lack of appetite , weight loss , dizziness , and agitation			1
in general , @entity4 's disease treatment can be a heartbreaking disappointment			1
the few drugs that are available tend to stop working over time , giving patients and families only a brief reprieve from the disease 's relentless progression			2
@entity0 : 25 signs and symptoms of @entity4 's disease in a new study of 295 people with an average age of 77 and moderate - to - severe @entity4 's , those taking donepezil saw improvements " equivalent to around four months ' worth of deterioration in cognition and function , " says lead study author dr. @entity49 , professor of old - age psychiatry at @entity51 , @entity52 put another way , those who discontinued donepezil lost " about a third more cognition over [ one year ] than they would have if they had stuck with it , " says @entity60 , @entity61 , director of geriatric psychiatry at @entity62 in @entity63 , who was not involved with the study			1
" this may not sound like much , but to a patient with alzheimer 's disease at this point in their illness or their carers , any improvement in cognition or function that supports independence is valuable , " @entity49 adds			1
@entity0 : 7 ways to protect your memory it 's possible that in some cases , even this much of a benefit could mean the difference between staying at home and going into assisted living			0
about 5.4 million people in the @entity86 have alzheimer 's disease , according to the @entity88			1
@entity7 was also more effective than another common @entity4 's drug , memantine ( @entity91 ) , in patients with later - stage disease , although memantine still showed some benefit , according to the study published this week in @entity97			1
in general , @entity4 's drugs are notoriously fickle , working relatively well for some , not as well for others , and not at all for some			1
" in some people , drugs are effective for many months or even up to several years			0
other people do n't see any benefit			0
other people are unable to take them because of side effects , " says @entity104 , @entity105 , senior associate director of medical and scientific relations at the @entity88			0
@entity0 : 9 foods that may help save your memory all of the patients included in this study were still living in communities ( as opposed to nursing homes ) in @entity116 and @entity117 and all had been taking donepezil for about two to three years by the time they enrolled in the trial			2
the men and women were randomly assigned to one of four treatment strategies for one year : continue taking donepezil ; stop taking donepezil and start taking an inactive placebo ; substitute memantine for donepezil , or continue taking donepezil and memantine together			2
people who continued taking donepezil did better on two different scales of cognition and impairment than those taking no medication or those taking memantine alone			2
there was some evidence in the study that the improvements were actually noticeable to families and others			0
for example , people who were taking only an inactive placebo were more likely than patients in other groups to drop out of study , suggesting these families had noticed the placebo " medication " was n't working			0
@entity0 : computer games that boost your memory " people [ who discontinued ] donepezil were much more likely to abandon the drug altogether , which implies that families picked up on the subtle effects of the drugs , " notes @entity60			2
taking either memantine or donepezil alone was better than nothing at all , but taking them together offered no additional benefit			0
although the combination of donepezil and memantine -- a common strategy in the @entity86 , but not the @entity52 -- had no added benefit , each drug had " independent positive effects , " says @entity49 , who advises patients at this stage of the disease to continue taking both drugs if possible			1
@entity91 , he says , " has an additional benefit of preventing the emergence of symptoms like agitation , suspiciousness , and aggression			0
" however , @entity189 , @entity61 , of the @entity190 @entity188 , @entity191 , wrote in an accompanying editorial that " further study " is needed to determine if memantine should be used in combination with donepezil			2
@entity0 : how to age - proof your memory @entity7 is approved in the @entity86 for all stages of @entity4 's while memantine is approved for moderate - to - severe @entity4			1
@entity7 is one of a class of drugs known as cholinesterase inhibitors while memantine is a glutamate moderator			0
" they both have slightly different ways of helping brain cells talk to each other longer , " says @entity104			0
it 's unclear if the results would apply to other cholinesterase inhibitors such as galantamine ( @entity215 ) or rivastigmine ( @entity217 ) , the editorial noted			0
in any event , families , patients and healthcare providers still face difficult decisions in how to treat individual @entity4 's patients			1
@entity0 : need a memory boost ? try these quick tips " this study starts to look at some of the questions about decisions that physicians and families are making every day , treating loved ones in moderate to severe , what should be treating with , should they stop treatment , should they continue and if so how long , practical , " says @entity104			0
" this underscores our need for more research to fully say what is the right path of treatment and we are desperately in need of more treatments and therapies to help @entity4 's patients			1
" the researchers note that stopping donepezil can cause withdrawal ( which can temporarily worsen symptoms ) , so the drug should be gradually tapered down before going off it completely			1
the @entity249 and the @entity250 funded the study			0

in general , @entity4 's disease treatment can be a heartbreaking disappointment
drug donepezil helps slow deterioration in cognition and function , study shows
researchers note that stopping donepezil can cause withdrawal
