judge @entity12 ruled on august 29 that @entity3 waited too long to file his challenge with the state @entity9			1
@entity3 filed the challenge 41 days after the election ; @entity12 said that under state law the challenge had to be filed within 20 days			0
@entity3 , who received strong support from tea party and anti-establishment groups , narrowly defeated @entity11 in @entity23 's june 3 @entity9 primary			1
neither candidate , however , cracked the 50 % threshold needed to win , forcing a runoff three weeks later that @entity11 won by slightly over 7,000 votes			0

@entity3 's campaign said there was evidence of election fraud			1
@entity3 's supporters argued , among other things , that african - american @entity32 improperly voted in the @entity9 runoff after participating in the @entity32 primary			2
