@entity0 -- when @entity4 sen. @entity3 of @entity5 rocked the political world with her announcement that she would not seek a fourth term in the @entity9 , she was forthright in expressing her frustration with " an atmosphere of polarization " in politics			1
but for all her transparency , it was one of @entity3 's @entity9 colleagues who perhaps best summed up her motivation for deciding to end her decades - long tenure on @entity20			1
" i think she lost hope , " sen. @entity21 , @entity23 - @entity22 , told @entity1			1
@entity21 , who like @entity3 had participated in bipartisan efforts to find compromise on hot - button issues , added , " you know , all of us need to believe there is a light at the end of the tunnel			2
if you lose that belief , why do you spend seven years of your life -- which in her case would have been her commitment -- to do something that there seems no hope			0
" citing partisanship , @entity3 makes surprising exit @entity3 is the latest in a string of centrist senators to announce that they will not seek re-election in the fall			1
late last year , sen. @entity51 , a conservative @entity52 from @entity53 , announced that he would not seek re-election in 2012			0
in a statement announcing his decision , @entity51 called for " those who will follow in my footsteps to look for common ground and to work together in bipartisan ways to do what 's best for the country , not just one political party			2
" at the beginning of 2011 , sen. @entity64 , an independent from @entity65 who caucuses with @entity66 but agrees with @entity9 @entity4 on many issues of foreign policy and national security , announced he would not run again in 2012			1
" i have not always fit comfortably into conventional political boxes , " @entity64 said at the time , " @entity52 , @entity4 , liberal or conservative			1
because i 've always thought my first responsibility is not to serve a political party but to serve my constituents , my state , and my country			0
" @entity51 and @entity64 are joined by sens. @entity77 , a centrist @entity52 from @entity78 focused on military and foreign affairs ; @entity81 , a @entity82 who said a re-election campaign would distract him from focusing on trying to solve the nation 's serious challenges ; and @entity87 , a @entity88 @entity52			2
retiring senators : time is ripe for bipartisanship while @entity3 's departure is indicative of growing partisanship in the @entity9 , it will also be an unexpected obstacle to conservatives ' ambition of regaining a @entity4 majority in the @entity9			1
@entity66 hold a 53 - 47 majority in the @entity9 but are defending 23 of the 33 seats up for grabs in november , including those of two independents who caucus with the @entity66			1
" it 's a significant blow to @entity4 prospects in picking up the @entity9 , " @entity103 , editor and publisher of the @entity103 , said			1
" they 're going to now have to defend a very difficult seat			0
" in the wake of @entity3 's announcement , both @entity103 and the @entity109 , both of which are nonpartisan , changed their ratings of the outlook for her @entity9 seat in the general election from " likely @entity4 " to a toss - up			1
@entity3 explains reasons for leaving @entity103 said that he thought " probably most people would agree " with @entity3 's comments about the climate in the @entity9			1
@entity125 ' upper chamber is starting " to look more and more like the @entity126 , " observed @entity103 , where @entity4 and @entity66 have recently found themselves in the past year on opposite sides of an ideological gulf			2
" [ the @entity9 's ] not there yet , " @entity103 said , " but it starts to look more like the @entity126 where you have people increasingly on both ends of the spectrum and relatively few people in the middle			2
and the people on each partisan side are more hesitant to compromise			0
" " the center has been under siege in our @entity125 , " @entity1 contributor @entity139 said			0
" this is not normal and it 's not healthy for our democracy , " @entity139 also said about the heightened level of partisanship in @entity125 currently			0
@entity139 : @entity3 's departure symptom of partisan illness @entity139 added , " we 've had divided government before and we 've been able to accomplish great things in our history			2
but because hyper - partisanship has hijacked our politics with this divided government [ right now ] we 've got dysfunctional government			0
" what @entity139 sees as dysfunction that impedes achieving bipartisan consensus , others -- especially conservatives and tea party movement activists -- see as a necessary and principled commitment to core ideological values			0
indeed , backed by support from the tea party movement , a cadre of close to 90 freshman @entity4 @entity126 members arrived in @entity0 in 2011 committed to imposing fiscal discipline and either rolling back or stopping many of @entity66 ' key policy priorities			2
" you 're calling them centrists and moderates , " @entity172 , chairman of the @entity173 , said of @entity3 and others on @entity20			1
" but they 're not centrists and moderates in the things that matter to us , and that 's fiscal responsibility			0
" " they are extreme on the spending , " @entity172 added , " and because of their reaching across the aisle and continuing to compromise we are now [ close to ] $ 16 trillion in debt			0
and we can not support people like that			0
" although observers like @entity103 believe @entity3 would have survived a primary challenge and won re-election , a year ago the @entity173 included @entity3 on its 2012 target list			2
" she 's definitely one that has voted to spend more and grow government and she 's definitely not a small - government , rein - in - the - spending senator , " @entity172 said of her organization 's decision to target @entity3 for ouster			2
asked about the paradoxical situation created by @entity3 's decision , with the @entity4 now facing a new obstacle in retaking the @entity9 , @entity172 made no apologies for the tea party movement 's push for more commitment to conservative fiscal principles			1
" regardless of whether president @entity215 is re-elected or not , we need to take back the @entity9 , " @entity172 said			2
" we have changed the narrative , " added @entity172 , " never before have @entity66 even been talking about cutting spending			0
so we have to take that gavel out of [ @entity219 ] @entity221 's hand			0
" @entity172 said @entity222 sens. @entity222 of @entity22 , @entity223 of @entity224 and @entity225 of @entity226 are examples of the kind of fiscal conservatives that the tea party movement would like to see more of in the @entity9 after this fall 's election			0
despite partisan pressures for firmer ideological commitments from conservatives and the tea party movement on the right , and increasingly from liberals and the @entity241 movement on the left , some centrists remain in the @entity9			1
" i am concerned when people like @entity245 , @entity3 and @entity51 leave the @entity9 , " said sen. @entity243 , @entity78			1
" i hope and pray it does n't mean the end of sensible people in the @entity9 who wan to get things done			2
" @entity243 was a member of the so - called " @entity250 , " a bipartisan group of senators who tried prior to the creation of the debt " @entity256 " this summer to arrive at a deficit - reduction deal that would have shaved roughly $ 4 trillion off the federal deficit			0
although the " @entity250 " did not succeed in crafting a plan that garnered enough support for passage in the @entity9 , @entity243 was quick to point out that the bipartisan effort did get 45 senators to sign on to its broad , bipartisan deficit reduction plan			1
and far from giving up on bipartisanship , @entity243 said that he and sen. @entity266 , @entity267 , have been hosting a series of bipartisan dinners for their fellow senators			1
four have been held so far , @entity243 said , with about 20 senators attending each gathering so that a majority of the @entity9 has already participated in the events			1
@entity4 shake - ups in @entity9 leadership " it does worry me if you allow voices on the ends of the political extreme to dominate the debate , " @entity243 said , " that 's not where the @entity284 people are			1
they want us to get things done			0
" pointing to @entity125 ' historically low approval rating , @entity243 said he thinks its " both good policy and good politics " to try to figure out ways to get things done in @entity125			0
@entity243 said he was " disappointed " to hear that @entity3 would not seek re-election			1
" she 's a great senator , " the @entity52 said of his @entity4 colleague , " she did n't view every issue through a partisan prism			0
" on the same day that @entity243 praised his soon - to - be former colleague , @entity3 held a news conference in her native @entity5 to explain her surprise decision			1
@entity3 told a gathering of family , friends , staff , and reporters that she did not see the partisan atmosphere in @entity125 changing			0
" to the contrary , what i like to call the sensible center has now virtually disappeared in @entity0 , " @entity3 said			0
@entity1 's @entity310 , @entity311 , @entity312 , @entity313 , @entity314 , @entity315 and @entity316 contributed to this report .			0
