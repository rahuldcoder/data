calling it a " cost of war , " @entity1 and @entity2 leaders announced a $ 17 billion compromise bill monday that would get veterans to a doctor more quickly , hire more medical staff , add dozens of new facilities and cut bonuses at the @entity11			1
as it aims to reshape medical care for veterans , the proposal also would plump up the deficit , adding $ 12 billion in red ink			2
the bill was hashed out over months and unveiled by the chairmen of the @entity19 and @entity20 after a weekend of negotiations			1
the deal would pour spending into both short - and long - term programs for the struggling @entity11			1
that money comprises : roughly $ 2 billion to lease 27 new medical facilities ; $ 5 billion for hiring doctors and nurses and some construction ; and $ 10 billion to go to a new program allowing veterans to seek outside care if they wait longer than 30 days for an appointment or live more than 40 miles away from a @entity34			2
more than a funding bill , this deal also gives the veterans secretary unprecedented power to quickly fire executives at the agency			1
anyone fired under that provision would have a week to appeal the decision and the case must be decided within 21 days or the person 's firing goes into effect			0
that agreement merged @entity2 ' insistence on an appeals process with @entity1 demand for fast consequences			0
" it is compromise legislation , " said @entity54 chairman @entity53 , a @entity55 independent , " ( there ) was give and take on both sides			2
" that includes the price tag , which is handled with a combination of emergency spending ( as @entity2 hoped ) and offsets ( as @entity1 wanted )			0
bad @entity11 care may have killed more than 1,000 veterans , senator 's report says specifically , lawmakers would offset some $ 5 billion of the spending by forcing other changes at the @entity11 , including what will amount to a cap on staff bonuses at the agency			1
but after those cost cuts at the @entity11 , the deal would add approximately $ 12 billion to the federal deficit			1
that 's usually something that @entity1 would block , but the two leaders behind the bill argue this issue deserves what they call emergency spending			0
" funding our veterans ' needs must be considered a cost of war , " @entity53 stressed			0
the toughest sell may be with spending - skeptic @entity92			0
but @entity95 chairman @entity94 , a @entity96 @entity1 , insists his fellow conservatives will give the bill the votes it needs			0
" i believe it will ( pass ) , " he told reporters monday			0
" taking care of veterans is not an inexpensive proposition			0
and i believe our members understand that			0
" republicans may warm up to the increased oversight in the measure , which requires an independent report on @entity11 health care , a commission on access to care and a task force to review the agency 's scheduling system			1
the 130 - page bill also contains a host of smaller provisions : it increases incentives for young doctors to work at the @entity11 by doubling the amount of their student loans the agency can repay per year			1
the deal comes under threat of travel clock , as @entity129 plans to leave for a five - week break by friday			2
@entity94 and @entity53 said they expect both chambers to vote on the legislation this week , though exact scheduling is still under discussion			2
