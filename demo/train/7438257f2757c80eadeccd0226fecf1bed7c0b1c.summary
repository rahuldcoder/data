-- the sentencing in @entity2 of journalists from @entity6 's @entity5 - language channel this week has shocked the @entity7			1
@entity9 @entity8 , formerly of the @entity10 , received seven years : so did @entity13 - @entity12 @entity11 , who had worked with @entity0			2
@entity14 , an @entity12 producer , was given 10 years			2
the @entity9 foreign minister , @entity15 , herself a trained lawyer , said the sentence was incomprehensible " based on the evidence presented in the case			0
" fear of the @entity21 appears to be a factor			0
@entity23 was elected as @entity12 president in 2012 with support from the @entity21 and from @entity26			2
since @entity23 's displacement in july 2013 , relations between @entity12 and @entity26 have been uncomfortable			2
@entity6 's arabic - language channel @entity30 ( " @entity31 " ) was identified as particularly close to the @entity21			0
the sentences handed down to @entity6 journalists may reflect the distrust of the current @entity12 regime for the @entity26 owners of the tv station			1
@entity6 has transformed both television reporting within the @entity39 and coverage of the @entity39 elsewhere			1
the characteristic logo of @entity6 is constantly seen on images fed to major television networks across the world			1
the channel was established by the emir of @entity26 in 1997 and originally employed many who worked -- before it folded -- with the @entity48			0
its style was more in line with western news media than national @entity39 channels of the time			1
the impact of its coverage of the first @entity57 established its credentials			0
although demonized by the @entity61 government in the period following 9/11 , when it broadcast interviews with @entity66 leaders , it has developed a formidable reputation both in the @entity39 and beyond			0
possibly the best way to gauge its success though has been through impartial interviews with its audience			0
i oversaw a survey , during which we interviewed more than 2,000 @entity76 speakers who watch satellite - delivered @entity76 television in @entity79			0
it revealed that @entity6 is widely viewed and is particularly popular with those of @entity39 , as opposed to @entity83 heritage			1
many talked with pride of the channel : one man in @entity88 said " it transformed how media treats news of the region			1
" it has a reputation for balance			0
an @entity5 viewer said " @entity6 is very much impartial , " while a @entity98 viewer said that @entity6 news was " better " than @entity98 news as it was less locally focused			0
several participants recommended @entity102 to non-arabic speaking friends so they discovered alternative points of view in the @entity107 world			0
debates are often raucous , stories are broken and images shown that may offend some viewers			0
while on the one hand @entity6 is suspected of fundamentalist @entity116 links , on the other some @entity76 speakers in @entity79 denounce it as a mouthpiece of the @entity61 for example , one @entity76 speaker from @entity121 cited the huge @entity61 air base in @entity26 as a reason for distrusting the channel			1
but @entity6 is part of a trajectory of modernization of media in the @entity76 world			1
it broadcasts in @entity131 , the modern literary lingua franca which spread in the 1920s as the intelligentsia of the @entity76 speaking world sought to modernize ( @entity76 dialects are so numerous as to be mutually incomprehensible			2
) @entity12 , the @entity39 's most populous nation , was at the heart of that process of modernization -- the @entity12 newspaper @entity140 was the paper of record for the @entity39 throughout the first part of the 20th century			1
after @entity146 , anti-imperialist radio , encouraged by then - president @entity145 , took on the @entity148 mantle			0
that process has continued in recent times			0
the satellite station @entity152 is a hugely successful entertainment channel watched in the @entity76 - speaking world and @entity79			2
during the @entity160 , new forms of communication used in @entity157 -- including @entity158 and @entity159 -- were portrayed as the new face of freedom of speech			1
the fate of the @entity6 journalists shows just how far @entity12 has now fallen			1

the jailing in @entity12 of three @entity6 journalists has shocked many in the @entity7
@entity176 : @entity6 has transformed tv reporting both within the @entity39 and of the region
its success is part of a trajectory of media modernisation of media in the @entity76 world , says *academic*
that process continued during the @entity160 with the *growth* of *social* media in @entity157 and elsewhere
