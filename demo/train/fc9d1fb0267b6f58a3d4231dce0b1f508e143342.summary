a mob of people have surrounded a group of animal rights activists protesting in the busiest open market in town			1
it 's the eve of @entity8 's annual dog meat festival , a tradition that dates back generations to celebrate the summer solstice			1
arguments ensue among those living in the city and the people who condemn the tradition			2
" do n't you eat beef ? if you stop eating beef , then we 'll stop eating dog meat , " yells one man frustrated with the intense media scrutiny in the @entity22 open market , where an array of birds , snakes , cats and livestock are sold as daily fresh fare			1
dozens of journalists , filmmakers and photographers have come to the city in @entity38 's southeast @entity37 province to document an event that lies at the center of a battle between deeply - ingrained tradition and the encroachment of the modern world			2
activists say dogs are part of the daily diet here , with an estimated 10,000 dogs killed for the festival alone			2
ask a local when the tradition of eating dog meat began and you 'll likely be met with a dumbfounded expression -- it is akin to asking someone when people started eating beef			1
for many in the city , eating dog meat is a hard habit to break , despite changing attitudes about the treatment of animals in @entity38			1
rising prices another man at the market criticizes the media attention for increasing the price of dog meat , which has doubled since 2011 and now goes for $ 6 a kilogram			1
in one stall , a butcher places a gutted and skinned dog on a wired sheath and uses a blow torch to cook a delicacy known to locals as " crispy skin dog meat			1
" as the shop owner butchers a another piece of dog , flecks of flesh flick onto her face			2
she tells @entity88 she 's been in the trade for over 10 years			2
" this is our tradition and we are used to eating dog			1
it 's our culture and we wo n't change ... it 's tasty ! but we wo n't kill our pet , " she says , referring to her own dog who is cowering in the other side of the shop			2
her dog tucks his head under a freezer , shielding his eyes from the carcasses of the dogs and cats hanging from hooks			2
signs around the market adorned with pictures of labradors and golden retrievers advertise raw dog meat for sale , despite new government regulations that restrict this practice			1
@entity119 , a 58 - year - old animal rights activists from @entity120 in southwest @entity38 , has made it her mission to stop dog meat consumption across @entity38			1
her protest in 2011 successfully ended the dog meat festival in @entity126 , in @entity128 province -- and she has now turned her attention to @entity8			1
it 's her fourth year protesting at the festival , and while dog meat continues to be a tourist attraction for the city , @entity132 feels that there is growing awareness of animal rights in this city of six million people			1
" i feel like we 've had a lot of improvement in public awareness			0
the first time we came here in 2011 all you could hear were dogs wailing as soon as you entered into the city , " @entity132 says , as she picks off ticks from the scruff of a black dog she rescued that morning			2
" the biggest change is that the word dog on street signs have to be covered			0
this means the government has become aware that this needs to be canceled			0
many people also realize that eating dog is not an honorable thing , " adds @entity132			1
boycott @entity132 is one of over 20 volunteers who have descended upon the city from the far reaches of @entity38 , to boycott the festival			0
many run dog and cat shelters in their hometowns and have spent their life savings to rescue abandoned and diseased animals			0
but canceling the annual @entity8 festival is now their main objective			1
another activist , @entity173 , said this is her first year protesting against the @entity8 dog meat festival			1
the soft spoken 59 - year old , who came to the city from @entity179 , says she 's spent her retirement money , roughly $ 1,000 , to save dogs -- a fact she 's reluctant to share with her children			0
she and another volunteer operate from makeshift shelter on the corner of a street in @entity8 , only a block from where live dogs are traded on a daily basis			2
though she has come here to fight for the rights of these animals , she 's pessimistic about any meaningful change here			2
" i have no hope that these people will change and our ability to make change is not significant enough , " @entity173 says			0
" we have to go through the government to create some laws to protect these animals , but there are no laws and our ability to do anything is insignificant			0
" @entity206 , a 64 - year - old retired steel worker , has also spent her life savings protecting street dogs and cats in @entity179 , and now she says she does n't even have money to charge her phone			0
@entity206 was cradling a dead puppy when @entity88 arrived at the makeshift shelter			0
she says the puppy was born after they had rescued a pregnant dog and this one did not make it			0
almost all the dogs appeared injured , disfigured and diseased			0
" what we need the most now is medicine , but it 's the most expensive thing , " @entity206 says as as she tears up			0
many of the dogs in her care are in desperate need of antibiotics to fight off infection , but the volunteers do n't know where to find them in the city			0
together , the activists say they 've saved more than 400 dogs this year alone in @entity8 -- yet this number will be dwarfed by the number of animals likely to be slaughtered for food at the festival			1
asked what makes this different from eating beef or pork , @entity243 's answer is unequivocal			1
" you can not categorically say that all animals should either be eaten or not eaten , " she says			0
" every animal has their its own value and worth			0
for example , grass - eating animals are meant to be supplied to humans			0
but these companion animals , such as dogs and cats , they are meant to contribute to human production -- such as drug - sniffing dogs or watch dogs , " so eating these animals compared to eating pork and lamb are two different things			0
their value is not the same			0
