@entity2 legislation to approve the @entity4 pipeline is headed back to @entity5 after president @entity6 vetoed the bill tuesday			0
@entity6 's veto of the bill comes after a yearslong debate on the controversial pipeline which ultimately handed a legislative victory to proponents of the pipeline after @entity14 took control of the @entity16 in january			2
the @entity17 and @entity16 may have come together to send a single piece of legislation to @entity6 , but do n't expect that agreement to lead to construction permits for the pipeline project that would ship crude oil from @entity24 to @entity26 refineries on the @entity27			1
republicans may have enough @entity30 support to clear a filibuster , but they 'll be hard - pressed to find the 67 votes to override a veto			0
so what 's the big fuss ? why is this one pipeline such a contentious issue and is it really worth the fight for opponents and advocates of @entity4 ? let 's break it down : how long would the @entity4 be ? @entity45 's full - fledged @entity4 system is waiting for @entity26 approval to finish construction on 1,200 miles of pipeline known as @entity4 -- the final piece of a 3,800 - mile pipeline network			0
there 's already a @entity4 pipeline ? that 's right			0
@entity4 represents just under a third of the entire @entity4 project , and every other piece of pipe has been built and laid out			2
in fact , @entity45 's pipeline system is already shipping hundreds of thousands of barrels of crude oil from the @entity24 oil sands across the @entity26 border -- and into @entity63			1
the current @entity4 proposal would run the pipeline through @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 oil sands ... that sounds familiar			1
that 's because oil sands are one of environmentalists ' biggest gripes over the proposed @entity4 since extracting crude oil from the oil sands ( oil + sand = oil sands ) pumps about 17 % more greenhouse gases into the air than standard crude oil extraction , according to a @entity87 review of the project			1
and either way , the @entity87 concluded the oil sands will be developed regardless of whether the pipeline goes through			1
but that 's not all that 's prompted environmentalists to protest @entity4 and deploy an inflatable pipeline on sen. @entity97 's front yard last november when she was leading the charge to pass the bill			0
environmentalists , local residents and indigenous tribes are also protesting the pipeline 's planned route , which would cut across the @entity106 , which is one of the world 's largest			0
@entity109 - what ? aquifer is just a fancy term for an underground layer of porous rock trapping large deposits of water that can often be accessed through wells -- there are about 2,500 within a mile of the would - be @entity4 route			0
aquifers are a key source of fresh water , and environmentalists are concerned the pipeline could pollute those reserves			0
but the @entity87 concluded in january -- amid continued objections from environmentalists -- that the impact on water quality " would be limited			1
" you said indigenous tribes were also protesting the project ? yes			0
native americans are concerned about the societal impact of camps with thousands of construction workers living near their communities , which face a high rate of sexual assaults from non-indigenous men , representatives of the activist @entity134 group said in an interview earlier this week			0
@entity145 a ' no ' on @entity4 vote and the pipeline would also run through the sovereign lands of some tribes			0
the @entity150 even declared that the @entity17 bill to approve @entity4 last week amounted to a declaration of war			0
if it comes to that , will the economic benefits be worth it at least ? depends what you consider to be " worth it			1
" the @entity87 concluded in january the project would create about 42,000 jobs directly and indirectly during the construction phase ( indirect : think commercial benefits for restaurants , shops , etc. )			1
that total includes 3,900 construction jobs to actually build the pipeline			0
fact checking @entity4 jobs claims all in all , the pipeline would inject $ 2 billion in total economic benefits , according to the @entity87 review			1
but once the construction -- which would last no more than two years -- wraps up , @entity4 will have created just 50 permanent jobs -- the number needed to maintain the pipeline			1
either way , the @entity87 's conclusions seriously undercut @entity45 's claims in 2011 that the project would create about 140,000 direct and indirect jobs			1
so if this pipeline goes through , what are the risks of an oil spill ? not too high			0
the @entity87 concluded the @entity4 proposal " would include processes , procedures , and systems to prevent , detect , and mitigate potential oil spills			1
" and will the pipeline help lower gas prices in the @entity26 ? not really			0
the @entity87 said @entity4 would have " little impact " on domestic gas prices			2
alright , so the @entity87 released its findings on @entity4 's impact in january			2
what 's the hold up ? the @entity87 concluded its review of the pipeline 's impact in january , but was waiting on a @entity205 case over the pipeline 's route to determine whether the pipeline project is in the @entity26 national interest			1
that supreme court approved the pipeline 's route through the state earlier this month , and the @entity87 has been reviewing that decision as it makes its final determinations			2
the @entity87 said the pipeline was not in the @entity26 national interest in 2011 , but @entity45 renewed its application in may 2012 after making changes to the proposed route			2
the @entity87 concluded in january 2014 that the @entity4 would have a negligible impact on the environment the @entity17 has insisted it will let the @entity87 's process play it before @entity6 makes a final decision on whether or not to approve the pipeline			2
the @entity87 is expected to conclude its final review soon , once it finishes reviewing comments from various federal agencies including the @entity229 , which urged the @entity87 in a february letter to reconsider the negative environmental impact the pipeline would have			1
@entity6 has said his top concern in making a decision will be " does it contribute to the greenhouse gases that are causing climate change			1
" for now at least , @entity6 will veto the @entity5 legislation and @entity4 is facing a dim future			0

the @entity87 *reported* the project would have *minimal* environmental impacts
proponents have touted economic benefits , but the proposal would generate few permanent jobs
the *production* of oil from oil sands emits more greenhouse gases
