-- the extraordinary new film " @entity2 " immerses us in the reality of historical slavery at a deep level of complexity and nuance			1
the film is an opportunity to honor all who were held in chattel slavery , treated like property , and subjected to levels of violence , torture , and control that no human should ever endure			2
the movie , directed by @entity20 , is also an opportunity to start a meaningful conversation about how prevalent slavery is today			1
most of us believe that slavery in @entity26 disappeared over a century ago			1
in the narrative we 've learned , the @entity27 , the @entity28 , and the @entity29 ended this horrific chapter in our nation 's history			0
but this narrative is simply wrong			0
slavery may no longer be legal or accepted			2
slavery may no longer be as brutal , as visible , or as blatant			2
but it 's time for us to fully absorb that slavery has been with us every day since the late 1800s			1
@entity40 , whose autobiography the film is based on , was a free man living with his family in @entity44 , @entity45 , during the 1840s			0
he was deceived , coerced , drugged , kidnapped , and sold into slavery			2
his money and documents were taken			0
he was given a new name , and his true identity was suppressed			0
he was physically and psychologically tortured , enduring abuse for years and threatened with death if he tried to escape			2
the parallels to slavery today are striking			2
the control mechanisms used by @entity40 's recruiters and captors are the same tactics and stories we hear about daily from the people who reach out to us for help on the @entity64 hotline , which @entity65 operates			0
the @entity66 estimates nearly 21 million people around the world are victims of modern slavery			1
. that 's 21 million people living in circumstances similar to those that drove @entity40 to despair			0
modern slavery is the man who was promised a job on a farm to earn enough money to pay for his parents ' medical care , then forced to work long hours , intimidated with violence , and made to live in deplorable conditions in a cramped room with his co-workers			1
it 's the man working in a restaurant who was assaulted by his manager and threatened should he ever try to leave			0
modern slavery is the 15 - year - old girl who was romanced and recruited by a pimp , then raped , beaten , and sold online into the commercial sex trade			1
it 's the woman from @entity26 held against her will in a house in the suburbs , paid only a fraction of the wages she was promised , and compelled to work as a domestic servant			1
these are only a glimpse into types of cases @entity65 learns about every day -- cases right here in the @entity107			1
human trafficking is a low - risk crime with high profits			2
the @entity111 estimated it to be a $ 32 billion a year industry in 2005 , and many in the anti-trafficking field believe that number is outdated and too low			0
as ubiquitous and overwhelming as the global scale of modern slavery feels , we ca n't shy away from the enormity of the challenge to address it			1
one way to respond is to offer a lifeline : to provide that one moment that helps someone get out of slavery			0
for the millions of men , women , and children being trafficked , that moment of opportunity does n't need to take 12 years to arrive like it did for @entity40			1
with global telecommunications technologies , political will , and anti-slavery resources , help can be one phone call or one text away			0
all of us can help create that moment of opportunity : learn about modern slavery and recognize its signs			1
share the national hotline number and post fliers in places where vulnerable populations might see it			0
report tips and relevant information about suspected slavery in your community by calling @entity65			1
urge your elected leaders to pass stronger anti-slavery laws that crack down on traffickers and protect survivors			0
support efforts nationally or in your community that are building a movement against modern slavery			1
we have a duty to learn from @entity40 's story and the horrors of historical slavery , to never let it happen again , and to mobilize for the 21 million victims of human trafficking still trapped in slavery			1
the opportunity to truly eradicate slavery is before us			0
now let 's rise to the challenge and seize it			0
