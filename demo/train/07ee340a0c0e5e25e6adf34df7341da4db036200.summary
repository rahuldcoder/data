@entity2 @entity0 is building a " significant presence " in disputed waters in the @entity4 through land reclamation , new analysis shows			1
satellite images from late january analyzed by @entity9 show that @entity0 is reclaiming a significant amount of land at three sites in the @entity13 , in addition to two other sites previously documented by the defense publication			1
" where it used to have a few , small concrete platforms , it now has full islands with helipads , airstrips , harbors , and facilities to support large numbers of troops , " @entity17 , @entity19 's @entity18 editor , told @entity1			0
" we can see that this is a methodical , well - planned campaign to create a chain of air and sea capable fortresses across the center of the @entity13 chain			1
" in november , the publication reported that @entity0 was building an " air strip capable " island at least 3,000 meters long on @entity38			1
the @entity4 is the subject of numerous rival -- often messy -- territorial claims , with @entity0 , @entity43 , @entity44 , the @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 disputing sovereignty of several island chains and nearby waters			1
the areas in dispute include fertile fishing grounds and potentially rich reserves of undersea natural resources			0
the latest images show for the first time reclamation at @entity58 -- a " large facility " is being constructed on 75,000 square meters of reclaimed land			2
@entity61 's also said that significant progress has been made at @entity63 and @entity64			0
" the buildings on @entity58 and @entity64 have almost identical footprints : that of a main square building with what appears to be an anti-aircraft tower or radome at each corner			0
" this suggests that @entity0 has standardized the design of key facilities and is rolling it out across its new islands			2
" @entity17 said that @entity46 , @entity47 and the @entity45 , which also claim the disputed archipelago , are modifying existing islands but not reclaiming land on a large scale			2
he said the reclamation would technically do little to bolster @entity0 's claims to the islands under the @entity84 because these have to be based on naturally occurring features			1
" that said , if @entity0 's on the ground and is heavily armed , then it is going to be nigh on impossible for anyone to challenge or remove it , so international law is moot on this one , " @entity17 said			0
@entity0 's @entity93 did n't immediately respond to a request for comment .			0
