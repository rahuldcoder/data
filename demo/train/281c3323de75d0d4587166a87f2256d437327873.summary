-- for a @entity2 looking for a snack , nothing might have tasted quite like the " chicken from hell			1
" that 's one way @entity7 describes @entity8 , the species of dinosaur that he and fellow paleontologists unveiled wednesday			1
it 's not the only way , though			2
feathered demon also works , which is why @entity8 -- derived from @entity15 mythology -- was chosen as a name			1
or you could characterize it , as @entity7 also told @entity0 , as a 600 - pound cross between an ostrich and a velociraptor			1
and it 's " pretty damn close " to looking like the 6 - foot - tall turkey a child famously referred to in the movie " @entity26 , " except a lot stranger and meaner looking			0
" you might think this was a really , really weird - looking bird , " @entity7 said			0
" ... but , in fact , this was a very bird - like dinosaur ... with a really long bony tail , very large hands and really sharp claws			1
" @entity7 , from the @entity35 in @entity36 , detailed the finding wednesday with fellow scientists from the @entity38 , the @entity39 in the scientific journal @entity41			0
this study came about not from one excavation but from three dating to @entity46 period and from a rock formation known as @entity48 in @entity49			0
the " chicken from hell " moniker aside , what makes @entity8 wylie especially exciting to paleontologists is that it 's the largest species of egg - stealing oviraptors yet found in @entity53 , said @entity60 , an evolutionary biologist at the @entity38			1
it 's also " the first largely complete skeleton i think anyone has found of these guys , " she said			1
@entity7 's predecessor at @entity35 -- @entity65 , now with the @entity39 -- had acquired two fossils that were dug up in the late 1990s in @entity49 by commercial fossil hunters			0
@entity7 said that he and @entity68 decided to work together to figure out what they had			0
their breakthrough came at a 2005 conference in @entity74 , where it became " abundantly clear " that a presentation from @entity60 and colleague @entity77 detailed the same species			0
collectively , they pieced together 75 % to 80 % of the skeleton , which is a very large percentage in paleontology circles , according to @entity7			2
rather than race to publish their finding first , the four scientists teamed up and by doing so , " learned more ... than we would all have learned independently , " said @entity7			0
what they learned was that the 11Â½ - foot - long , roughly 10 - foot - tall @entity8 had a bird - like beak and apparent feathers , with a large crest atop its skull and less of a tail than a @entity2			1
it munched on vegetation , small animals and perhaps eggs			2
a replication of its skeleton is on display inside @entity36 's @entity35			2
that 's a very different environment from the lush , warm , humid , almost bayou - like conditions that it enjoyed roughly 66 million years ago in what 's now a very different @entity49			0
not that it was an easy life			0
@entity60 noted that one specimen appeared to have a broken rib , while another had a busted toe			0
and those injuries are nothing compared with @entity8 's likely efforts dodging the so - called @entity112			1
" it probably spent a lot of its life , " @entity7 pointed out , " on the lookout for @entity2			1
" itsy bitsy dinosaur had a famously big cousin biggest predator ever to stalk @entity121 : 4 - inch teeth and 33 feet long check out a mutant blend of a triceratops and a giant parrot			2

@entity8 lived near the end of the dinosaur era *alongside* @entity2
it looked like a cross between an ostrich and velociraptor , an *expert* says
remains of three animals were used to piece together its skeleton
