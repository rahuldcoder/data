-- as a mother , you send your children off to their first day of kindergarten with pride , anticipation and excitement			0
but a part of you ca n't shake those nagging questions : will they make friends ? have someone to play with at recess ? be bullied ? as director of @entity18 's @entity17 , and the mother of a child with @entity21 , those questions do n't just go away with time			1
and that worry only intensifies			0
my 14 - year - old son , @entity23 , was born with @entity21			1
before he turned 3 , he had undergone three open heart surgeries and a tracheotomy , and his breathing required a ventilator			0
heading into kindergarten , @entity23 was nonverbal , had delayed cognitive abilities and received his nutrition from a feeding tube			1
there was no doubt about it : my son was n't like his peers			1
because of his differences -- and research showing children tend to single out peers with characteristics like his -- i feared that @entity23 could become a poster child for children expected to be the targets of bullying			1
we live in a small community , where @entity23 has known all of his classmates since kindergarten and will eventually graduate high school with most of them			1
they have the same classes , eat lunch at the same time and attend field trips together			0
for all of these reasons , i decided the best way to address my concerns about @entity23 would be to become his advocate -- not only with adults , but with his peers			1
during his first year of school , i started visiting @entity23 's classroom to talk with his classmates about @entity21			1
i discovered that most children were n't concerned about his cognitive issues ; they were actually more fascinated with why he did n't talk			0
at this time , i also networked with his teachers , his paraprofessionals and even made sure the lunchroom workers knew me			0
i hoped the more these people felt comfortable with me , the more information they would share			0
now , years later , @entity23 has just started the eighth grade			1
he 's not bullied , and more than that , he loves school			2
it 's the place where his peers give him high fives in the hallway , ask him to sit by them at lunch and -- best of all -- genuinely accept him			0
i have been @entity23 's advocate , but i ca n't take all , or even most , of the credit for @entity23 's acclimating so well to school			1
that credit belongs to his teachers , school staff and classmates , particularly a group of students who received training in sixth grade on how to prevent bullying and speak out on @entity23 's behalf			1
we call them his peer advocates , and if they see bullying , they intervene , ask the bully to stop or report the situation to an adult			1
the concept sounds simple , but because my son ca n't tell me what happens during the day , i depend heavily on these peers to act as his voice			2
now , what started as four kids in sixth grade has evolved to a schoolwide project with more than 40 students volunteering to become peer advocates so they can help @entity23 and other students who are different			1
i know all too well that not every parent of a child with a disability has this good fortune			0
although i 've found that power comes from sharing and being direct , i realize this approach wo n't work in every classroom where bullying exists			2
but there are always ways that parents , teachers and students can develop strategies and begin to teach young people the importance of inclusion , acceptance and -- most important -- respect			2
the act of bullying hurts not only the children involved , but the entire community			0
that 's why @entity139 has organized @entity140 in october , a time for communities nationwide to unite and promote bullying prevention through creative resources designed to engage , educate and inspire			1
ignoring the problem is not the answer			0
instead , our communities can take steps to raise awareness of bullying and start teaching young people that the end of bullying really does begin with them			2
bullying has affected too many for too long			0
hope for the teachers who want bullying to end			2
hope for the students too afraid to go to school			0
and hope for the mothers and fathers of children with disabilities -- that one day , they will drop off their children on the first day of kindergarten without having to worry about whether they will be bullied			0
instead , they can expect their children will be included and respected by their peers for everything they are			0

@entity17 for @entity172 's @entity170 feared for @entity21 son
@entity23 was n't bullied because @entity170 was *proactive* , teaching kids , working with teachers
students were trained to be peer advocates , she says , to intervene in bullying situations
@entity170 's organization started @entity140 to educate the *public*
