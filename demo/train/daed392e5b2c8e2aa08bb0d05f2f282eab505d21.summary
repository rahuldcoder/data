more than three years after @entity1 plunged into the southern @entity2 , killing all 228 people aboard , authorities are preparing to release their final report on the fatal crash			1
@entity7 's @entity6 ( @entity6 ) said the data indicated that the flight from @entity10 to @entity11 crashed because the aircraft 's speed sensors gave invalid readings , but there are other theories on why the plane went down			1
when did @entity1 go down ? flight 447 -- which was en route to @entity11 from @entity10 -- made its last contact with @entity22 's @entity21 ( @entity23 ) at around 01:33 gmt on june 1 , 2009 , informing the center of the plane 's position as it crossed the @entity2			1
soon after , @entity22 's air control contacted @entity30 's control center in @entity31 and reported that @entity1 was entering an area on its route known for constant bands of severe turbulence , officials said			1
there was no further contact with the plane			2
history 's deadliest plane crashes do we know why @entity1 crashed ? last year 's @entity6 report said the airplane climbed to 38,000 feet when " the stall warning was triggered and the airplane stalled			1
" it then descended , crashing into the @entity2			1
the descent lasted 3 minutes and 30 seconds and the engines remained operational , said the report			2
studies of the debris and bodies that were found soon after the crash led the @entity6 to conclude the plane hit the water belly first , essentially intact			2
oxygen masks were not deployed , indicating that the cabin did not depressurize , the @entity6 said in a 2009 report			1
tests have already brought into question the performance of pitot tubes , which measure the pressure exerted on the plane as it flies through the air , and are part of a system used to determine air speed			1
before it crashed , @entity1 sent out 24 automated error messages that suggested the plane may have been flying too fast or too slow through the thunderstorms , officials have said			1
the @entity73 issued a directive in late august requiring airlines to replace pitot tubes manufactured by @entity77 on @entity78 and @entity79			2
it said airlines should replace them with other @entity77 tubes and those manufactured by @entity85			2
the lack of speed , wind or direction information also prevented the autopilot system from functioning , said air accident investigator @entity91 said at the time of the crash			1
" this tells us that the plane has to be , in this case , directed by the pilot , " he said			2
who 's really flying the plane ? what about the weather ? flight 447 was passing through an area prone to volatile and dangerous weather known as the @entity106 ( @entity106 ) , when it went down			2
the @entity106 is a belt of low pressure that wraps around the planet			1
clouds and storms form along it because it is literally where the winds of the world 's hemispheres meet			2
here , air and water temperatures are typically in the mid- 80s			1
the warm , moist air is heated further by the blazing tropical sun. steamy air , coming off the ocean , rises until it hits cooler , drier air aloft , forming clouds and thunderstorms			1
these gigantic storms contain volatile updrafts and downdrafts that can move at speeds of 100 mph			2
the height of these storms also can tower to more than 10 miles in the air			1
even if you stacked two dozen of the world 's tallest skyscrapers on top of each other , they still would n't reach the tops of the biggest thunderstorms of the @entity106			0
however @entity141 pointed out that hundreds of airliners pass through the @entity106 every day without incident			0
" there was another @entity146 flight 30 minutes behind @entity1 that night and it encountered no problems , " he said			1
153 bodies identified from 2009 @entity146 crash any other theories ? according to @entity141 , many aviation experts have yet to rule out the human factor			1
" the crash happened at around 2:00 a.m. on a dark night when the error messages suddenly appeared and the autopilot tripped out			0
" he said the crew , possibly at their deepest circadian low at this point , suddenly have this problem and they " fixate " on it			0
" this is a syndrome , " he said			0
" there have been lots of accidents where pilots have fixated on correcting a relatively minor problem and lose sight of the macro problem			0
now we do n't know that , but we do know the aircraft acted as if it was not being controlled purposefully			0
" whether it was out of control -- and i doubt this -- it was not being controlled			0
imagine it is 2 am and two sleepy pilots encounter a problem			0
they do n't have much to do so they decide to troubleshoot this problem			0
they fixate on it and forget the autopilot has tripped			0
" the airplane meanwhile goes into a lazy spiral descent -- the pilots do n't notice as it is all very gentle			0
and when they look up they do n't believe what their instruments tell them and they get disorientated and ca n't recover			1
" he highlighted a similar case in 2004 when pilot disorientation and loss of control caused a @entity198 737 - 300 to crash in the @entity199 shortly after take off from the @entity201 resort of @entity202			0
though @entity201 authorities disputed the claim , aviation safety officials in @entity7 and the @entity204 cited " spatial disorientation " as the likely cause based on evidence available , according to the @entity209 ( @entity209 )			0
how long did it take to find the wreckage ? it took four searches over the course of nearly two years to locate the plane 's flight recorder and the bulk of the wreckage , still containing many bodies , in a mountain range deep under the ocean			0
the area where the @entity223 went down is in the @entity224 -- two to four days for ships to reach from the nearest ports in @entity22 or @entity227 in @entity228			0
the @entity204 @entity229 estimates the ocean depth in the area at 3,000 meters ( about 9,840 feet ) to 7,500 meters ( 24,600 feet )			1
@entity22 officials have said the sea depth in the area is around 2,000 to 3,000 meters ( 6,562 to 9,842 feet )			2
the search that turned up the bulk of the wreckage in 2011 covered a 46 - mile ( 75 - kilometer ) radius around the last known position of @entity1 , investigators said , in an area rough with underwater mountains and valleys			1
" it is a mountain range as big as the @entity246 , " @entity141 of @entity243 told @entity244			0
" there was always the possibility that the wreckage from the aircraft disappeared down a crevasse			0
this is not a flat - bottom environment like the @entity254 is			0
" crash pilot : ' damn it , we 're going to crash '			0

@entity1 plunged into southern @entity2 killing all 228 people in 2009
tests on instruments measuring air speed and pressure seen as one factor
expert : search for wreck " *unprecedented* in terms of depth and *sub-sea* *terrain* "
