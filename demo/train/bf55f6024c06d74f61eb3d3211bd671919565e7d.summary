-- since the revolution which ousted former president @entity3 from power after 30 years , the world has grown accustomed to seeing @entity6 revolutionaries protesting on the streets of @entity8			1
but there is another , less well - known group of protesters on the streets these days -- pro-mubarak supporters , who gather , wearing t - shirts with slogans and holding up pictures of @entity3 , proclaiming their support for the ex-president			1
they call themselves the " @entity21 " -- men and women , rich and poor -- ardent supporters of the former president , who believe he deserves respect and is innocent of charges of corruption and killing protesters			1
offended by the ousting of @entity3 , they say insulting the former president is like insulting @entity6			1
@entity3 's trial resumes monday and he could face the death penalty if convicted			2
on the two occasions when @entity3 previously appeared in court in august at the @entity36 , wheeled into a courtroom cage on a hospital gurney , hundreds of the @entity21 gathered outside			1
they chanted : " @entity40 , hold your head high " ... " we will demolish the prison and burn it down , if @entity3 is sentenced			2
" during his second appearance , on august 15 , tensions between the sons and anti-mubarak protesters flared into violence			2
under the blazing sun , hundreds of @entity3 's opponents and supporters threw rocks at each other , leaving dozens injured			1
mostly men and a few women , and of all age groups and social backgrounds , the sons are well organized and immediately recognizable by their t - shirts , which say in @entity61 : " i am @entity6 , and i refuse to insult the nation 's leader			1
" " we are supporting the president in a peaceful manner , " said engineer @entity65 , a founding member of the group			2
there are 30 founding members and the group 's facebook page " we are sorry , mr. president " has more than 100,000 followers , many of whom have participated in the group 's regular charity events and the protests , according to @entity79			2
@entity82 , another founding member of the group created the @entity86 page on february 26 , the day after the @entity6 revolution started because of " the images of protesters waving their shoes , and burning posters of @entity3 " he saw			1
" it was total disrespect of a war hero , " he said			0
@entity94 , an @entity6 journalist and the group 's media coordinator claims there are still many supporters of @entity3 in @entity6 , but that they are too scared to support him openly			1
" the media does not give us a voice and many @entity3 supporters want to take to the streets but are scared for their well - being			1
" we were all hurt by the treatment of president @entity3 , he is no dictator and insulting him is insulting @entity6 , " said @entity94 at one of the group 's weekly meetings , in a @entity8 coffee shop			1
they also meet in their homes to discuss strategy and divide tasks			0
many in @entity6 see the group as a remnant of the former regime , although the @entity117 deny links			1
some @entity6 even accuse them of being delusional			2
@entity119 , an @entity120 protester , said : " they showed up outside @entity121 carrying one expensive huge birthday cake on may 4th to celebrate @entity3 's 83rd birthday			2
" many @entity6 also believe that the @entity21 are funded externally , perhaps by the @entity125 or @entity126 , who they think have an interest in supporting @entity129 - friendly @entity3			1
it is an accusation the group denies			0
" if we had external funding , we would have rounded up millions of people in @entity135 ( @entity135 , during the revolution ) like they did , " said @entity94			0
" our money comes from internal donations by group members , who are professionals who came together spontaneously			0
" that is where we get money to print 1,000 t - shirts and posters , " he added			0
the sons refuse to use the word revolution to describe the events that led to @entity3 stepping down earlier this year and , they say , none of them protested in @entity135 -- the heart of the @entity6 revolution			1
@entity94 said , while other group members nodded their agreement : " it 's not a revolution because it destroyed the country , has no cohesive leader , and disrespects the ethics of our kind @entity6 society			1
" @entity94 accuses @entity163 movements of hijacking the revolution : " the protesters who took the streets on january 25 were decent , people , calling for change and reform			2
" but , others rode the wave ... like the @entity171 , and certain liberal movements too			0
leaders such as dr. @entity174 of the @entity171 and dr. @entity175 of the @entity177 ( liberal secular ) political parties fed the protesters their personal demands			0
" the sons of @entity3 deny the former regime 's involvement in violence directed against protesters during the revolution , particularly the now - infamous " @entity186 " on february 2 when government loyalists rode camels and horses through the protest camp , leaving two dead			1
a fact - finding judicial committee later found that @entity192 , former secretary - general of @entity3 's @entity193 ( @entity193 ) , was among parliamentarians who had hired thugs to attack crowds			2
" it ( the @entity186 ) was all staged by the @entity171 , " according to @entity94			0
" that same night , tell me how the @entity3 supporters were able to throw @entity200 cocktails from the roof of a building controlled by the @entity203 ? " he added			1
the group maintains that they are independent , but some in @entity6 accuse @entity3 's lawyer , @entity206 , of mobilizing and funding them			1
they include @entity207 , a prosecuting lawyer suing @entity3 on behalf of a man who was shot and badly injured by the security forces during the revolution			1
" i believe @entity206 coordinates with former members of the regime and @entity3 's family to fuel some sympathy for the ousted president , " @entity207 said			1
on august 15 , @entity207 was beaten and threatened by sons of @entity3 members while conducting a tv interview outside the @entity36			1
@entity0 was able to acquire photos of the beating			0
the previous month , @entity206 made a telephone call to @entity0 to say the @entity117 -- and what he described as the " silent majority " -- were planning a protest in @entity225 , an upper - class neighborhood in @entity8			1
" you should send a camera to cover it , " @entity206 said			0
when asked , @entity79 admitted the @entity21 are in " constant communication " with @entity206 , but insisted their relationship with him is based on similar interests			2
" we only take his opinion and legal advice to make sure our actions do not harm @entity3 's case , " @entity79 said			2
the @entity21 recently started a campaign to mobilize the so - called " silent majority			1
" they describe them as the 75 million @entity6 who did n't take to the streets during the revolution -- " the mothers and elders and their daughters " who support and love @entity3 yet remain confused on how to express their views			1
" we encourage them not to stay silent , " said @entity79			0
" they are scared to voice their opinion or take a step forward			0
" the group has recently started a charity campaign called " @entity253 , " which , they say , donates blood and babysits children in hospitals among other projects			0
" last week , we were able to channel $ 9,000 donated by our followers on @entity86 directly to the account of the @entity262 to assist the treatment of cancer patients in a room now carrying the name @entity3 , " claimed @entity79			2
they are also launching a newspaper called the " @entity269 " to " channel our voice , " said @entity94			0
" it will be distributed for free across all @entity6 's districts			2
" the first issue includes evidence acquired from current government officials , says @entity94 , that the number of protesters killed in @entity135 during the revolution was " exaggerated			0
" the group says they hope @entity3 will be acquitted , but for now they plan to do good deeds in his name and deter any campaigns that tarnish his reputation			1
winning the hearts of minds of the @entity6 society may be a challenge			0
some members of the group face opposition from within their own families			0
sons of @entity3 member @entity293 said : " my brother and i do n't talk at all since january 25 -- he still does not get it , that the energy of the youth was used by external forces			1
" members of the group also say they have received threats			0
group members showed @entity0 samples of threatening emails and mobile phone text messages			0
one text read : " if you do n't stop you will go to prison or be killed			0
i will see you in the streets			0
" " they ( the revolutionaries ) get our phone numbers off the flyers we distribute and terrorize us , " @entity310 , said while displaying the message on his @entity312			0
one upcoming protest it is unlikely the @entity117 will attend is the " @entity320 , " organized by the january 25 coalition , a group of pro-democracy political parties , planned for september 9			0
" we will not attend because we do n't want to be used as scapegoats when things turn ugly , " said @entity94			0
" we will be outside the court at @entity3 's next hearing on september 5			2
i believe he is innocent of all charges			0
" on saturday , five @entity329 lawyers arrived to @entity6 to join the @entity3 defense team			1
@entity94 said : " we organized a press conference for the five lawyers on sunday and rented a hall at the @entity335 hotel to give them a chance to explain to the media why they volunteered with this good deed			0
" " we are standing beside former president @entity3 because he stood by us in liberating @entity329 during the invasion and we can not forget that he stepped down to avoid the bloodshed of his own people , " @entity339 , one of the @entity329 lawyers told @entity0 at the press conference			1
the press conference ended with a tense confrontation , which @entity0 witnessed , between several journalists and members of the sons until the hotel 's security intervened before the police arrived on the scene			0
" several journalists started the problem when they called us ' the thugs of @entity3 , ' " said @entity94 .			0
