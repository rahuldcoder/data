-- inside her @entity4 , @entity3 , kindergarten classroom , @entity1 has 24 cubbies , 24 tables and 24 seats			0
it 's a perfect fit for her 24 little students , no more			1
but come next fall , she expects that number will grow to 30			0
that 's when forced federal spending cuts , also known as the sequester , will kick in and start chipping away at education funding			1
" where will i put six more students ? " milders asked			2
" my young learners come to my classroom with little or no school experience			0
i not only need to meet their academic needs , but their social and emotional needs as well			0
" the government is set to cut $ 85 billion through the end of the fiscal year , september 30			1
of that money , $ 2.5 billion will be coming out of the @entity29 's $ 70 billion budget			1
uncertainties surround how these large cuts will affect schools , because the decisions will be made on the state and local levels			1
but with budget cuts looming , many teachers like @entity18 are wondering what 's left to cut			1
@entity1 , who has taught kindergarten for 17 years , worries that more cuts to education will not only affect her students ' ability to learn and grow , but also fears she will eventually be replaced by a younger and cheaper teacher , as she put it			1
" it happens often , " she said			0
the 42 - year - old teacher is certified to teach kindergarten through eighth grade , but she said because her pay is tied to students ' test results , it is difficult for her to move to higher grades			1
with the often short notice , it 's tough to be adequately prepared to prep her students for state tests			1
" many times teachers are not told what grade or building they will be teaching until as little as a day or two before classes begin , " she said			2
similarly , @entity63 , a newcomer to teaching from @entity65 , @entity66 , also said he feels left in the dark			0
the fifth grade teacher said it is hard for him to predict how forced spending cuts overall will affect him and his students			1
" in the past , my district has tried to keep budget cuts as far from the classroom as possible			1
in other words , they have -- and i 'm sure will continue to -- make every effort to meet their federal obligations while preserving as much personnel as possible			2
" but despite his district 's previous attempts to keep teachers and staff after budget cuts , the 33 - year - old is worried that schools will still be forced to cut vital resources for teaching			1
while he 's sure many professions have suffered from tightening budgets , he 's scared for his students			1
" i worry that technology which prepares students to compete globally will be seen as luxuries , not necessities , and thereby put our students behind the eight - ball , " he said			2
@entity63 's worry is justified			2
@entity101 students are lagging behind their international peers in other countries , ranking 25th among 34 countries in math and science , according to the @entity107			2
a study published in 2012 by @entity110 's @entity109 found that students in industrialized foreign countries were outpacing @entity101 students academically			1
countries like @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 were making education gains twice as fast as @entity101 students			1
@entity63 said he has seen how previous budget cuts affected his school when teachers ' aides were let go			1
to help curb spending , he tries to be more judicious with his limited school supplies			0
we 're not alone , " he said			0
" if i had time in the midst of all my other grading to grade @entity131 ' handling of this sequester , they would get an ' incomplete			2
' " but @entity131 is not the only player with something to lose in the budget cut battle ; president @entity136 is feeling the pressure , too			1
earlier this month , @entity136 's approval rating took a brief hit because of the budget sequester , dropping from 53 % to 49 % in the polls , according to @entity142			1
@entity63 is disappointed in @entity143 for letting the budget situation get this bad			1
" what i would like @entity131 to cut is the political theater that has in many ways led to this day , " he said			0
" i see the spending cuts as being symptomatic of a much deeper problem			0
" like @entity63 , @entity152 is more concerned with what forced spending cuts will mean for his students than his paycheck			1
he and his wife are both teachers in @entity159 , @entity160 , and for the past four years , he said , teachers in his area have endured 2 % to 3 % cuts to their salary			2
" so many of us are right on the edge financially that just 50 to $ 100 is enough to really hurt , " he said			0
in the past 30 years , teachers have seen their salaries shrink			0
on average , teachers make 14 % less than other professionals who work in jobs that require a similar level of education , according to the @entity176			2
even though the 48 - year - old science teacher is n't concerned about his own teaching salary , he fears budget cuts will start trickling into his classroom , where he teaches a handful of special education students			1
a loss in funding could mean he could lose his " collaborative teacher ; " the two work together so they can spend adequate time with each student individually			0
@entity190 also teaches special education students and said he is outraged after learning that forced spending cuts could potentially affect them			1
" i do n't think cutting special education works with any political ideology , " said the 26 - year - old teacher from @entity194 , @entity195			2
president @entity136 warned @entity131 that forced spending cuts would affect special education students and people with disabilities			1
special education programs could lose $ 840 million because of the cuts and 7,200 special education teachers , aides and staff members could lose their jobs			1
@entity190 has already seen the aftermath of previous budget cuts in his area ; he only works four days a week			1
that happened in 2011 after the district cut one special education position and a teaching position at his school in @entity216			2
as a result , the ratio of students to teachers at each grade level is approximately 25 to one , he said			2
in a two - hour reading block , @entity190 used to spend six minutes with each of his 20 students			2
but add five children to his classroom , and that gives him less than five minutes per child			0
" we all need more than that ; 4.8 minutes per kid is not a recipe for success , " he said			0
" i understand fiscal responsibility is important			0
but these are n't blind cuts , " he said			0
" i see them every day			0
and i think other people need to see them , too , " he said			0
@entity241 teacher @entity240 loves her job , but like @entity190 , she hates how education always seems to be on politicians ' chopping block			1
" it 's a bipolar world we 're living in , " she said			0
" on the one hand , lawmakers are mandating that we up our standards , while on the other they 're cutting funding			0
" in her area , the way teachers are evaluated is changing			0
more than 23 states are tying teachers ' salaries to students ' test scores			2
" bottom line is standards are changing , evaluations are changing -- and this is an even bigger deal when you consider we have n't seen salaries keep up with inflation -- while those who control our laws and our budgets are winning elections claiming they will get more accountability , more results out of us while shaving away dollars , " she said			0
as a high school journalism and film teacher , she worries that elective courses will be the first programs let go because of forced spending cuts			0
" add the federal cuts to state and local ( cuts ) and our future does n't look so bright , does it ? " but @entity1 , the kindergarten teacher from @entity3 , said the outlook for teachers does n't have to be so grim if the right cuts are made			1
she suggested @entity131 look into cutting school days from five to four			0
" longer days i know , but we could save on electric , water , food , fuel for buses , hourly employees			0
and let 's share administrators , " she said			0
when she was younger , @entity1 dreamed of being a teacher , but it 's a profession she is struggling to stick with as fears of more budget cuts threaten an already shrinking department			1
" those of us who became teachers to help children realize their full potential as learners are not just frustrated , we are heartbroken			0

the federal government is set to cut $ 85 billion this year because of the sequester
$ 2.5 billion will be cut from the @entity29 's budget
teachers are unsure how these budget cuts will affect them and their students
many teachers say they are fed up with @entity143 putting education on chopping block
