@entity0 -- president @entity3 will award the @entity4 , the military 's highest award for bravery , to air force chief master sgt. @entity8 for his valor in saving the lives of three wounded comrades at a then - secret base in @entity13 in 1968 , the @entity2 announced friday			1
after @entity8 saved his fellow airmen , he was shot and killed by enemy fighters			2
his heroics were kept a secret for years because the @entity18 was n't supposed to have troops in @entity13 during the @entity20			1
president @entity21 rejected a nomination for @entity23 to receive the @entity4 at the time because of the political trouble it could have stirred up			0
@entity8 was part of a secret @entity18 @entity28 radar base in northern @entity13 , just 120 miles from @entity29 in @entity30			1
the base 's purpose was to guide @entity18 bomber crews on their missions over @entity30 and parts of @entity13 that were under communist control			1
@entity13 was officially neutral during the war , but its leaders were upset that @entity30 troops and @entity41 guerrillas were moving through @entity13 to attack @entity18 troops in @entity43			1
so the @entity13 government allowed construction of the @entity18 radar site provided it was kept secret , according to @entity47 , an @entity28 b - 52 squadron commander during the @entity20 and currently a military historian with the @entity49 at @entity50			1
in march of 1968 @entity30 troops attacked the site , called @entity53 85 , with a force of 3,000 soldiers against fewer than a couple dozen @entity18 airmen and about a thousand @entity13 soldiers			1
eventually , @entity18 helicopters were sent in to evacuate the @entity28 personnel , but by then eight @entity18 had been killed and several more wounded			2
it is considered by some the deadliest ground attack against @entity28 troops in the entire @entity30 era			0
according the @entity2 , @entity8 deliberately exposed himself to enemy fire " in order to place his three surviving wounded comrades in the rescue slings permitting them to be airlifted to safety			2
" it took an act of @entity72 in 2008 for @entity8 to be reconsidered for a @entity4 so long after the war had ended			2
in most cases , the medal recommendation must be made within two years of the act of heroism for which it is to be awarded			0
rep. @entity79 of @entity80 helped push for the reconsideration			0
@entity8 was a native of @entity82 , @entity80			0
" @entity84 was denied the @entity4 because he was serving his country on the wrong side of a geographic barrier , " @entity79 said in written statement			0
" heroism knows no boundary			0
while it 's regrettable that this medal is coming forty years after mr. @entity8 's death , i am honored to be part of the effort that recognized this true hero			1
" the ceremony for @entity8 , which will include his three sons , is scheduled for september 21 at the @entity2 .			0

new : the @entity18 did not want to admit it had troops in nominally neutral @entity13
chief master sgt. @entity8 's heroism was hidden for years
he died after saving three comrades in @entity13
