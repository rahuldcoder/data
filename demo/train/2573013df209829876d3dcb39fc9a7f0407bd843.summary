-- i remember fragments of the story of @entity6 trainer @entity5 's killing in 2010 -- something about a ponytail , something about her slipping and falling , something about how this almost never ever happens because in these parks , the animals are happy and the trainers are safe			1
but something was n't right			1
i remember asking someone why an orca -- a highly intelligent animal -- would attack its trainer or essentially " bite the hand that feeds it			1
" we sometimes hear of dogs mauling other people , but in these cases we do n't seem to hear about them attacking their masters			2
so why would @entity29 's lovable @entity28 turn against us ? how could our entire collective childhood memories of this delightful water park be so morbidly wrong ? i came in with these questions			1
i set out to understand this incident , not as an animal activist -- because i 'm not one -- but as a mother who had just taken her kids to @entity6 , and of course as a documentary filmmaker who unfortunately ca n't let sleeping dogs lie			2
@entity6 answers questions about ' @entity42 ' i brought @entity43 aboard as the film 's producer , and he soon became my right arm			1
i spoke to @entity47 who wrote a phenomenal article for outside magazine about killer whales and asked him to come aboard as an associate producer			2
we were then funded by investors who had never made a film before			1
together we set out to tell this story of an incident at @entity6			2
i knew immediately that i wanted @entity6 to have a voice in the film			1
we e-mailed back and forth for about six months			2
i gave them every chance to talk , but they eventually declined			2
at that point , however , i had already began peeling back the onion			2
and my journey of shock and discovery was well underway			2
i have made television documentaries for 15 years , but " @entity42 " is my second feature documentary and my first one to have found theatrical distribution			1
i ca n't say this was an easy film to make			1
there were nightmares , too many autopsy reports , sobbing interviewees and unhappy animals			0
@entity6 is a $ 2 billion a year entity , and they 'll do anything to protect their greatest asset : @entity28			1
but as i moved forward i knew that in telling this story in an honest and fact - driven way , i was telling the truth			0
it sounds @entity85 © but it 's really that simple			1
at some point you 're simply compelled , in spite of yourself , to tell a story that needs to be told no matter how scared you are of an entity that could squash you			0
opinion : ' @entity42 ' ignores @entity6 's benefits to conservation , research two years after i wrote the treatment in 2010 we finished " @entity42			1
" i can say that my crew and i are all profoundly changed by the experience			0
i know that killer whales are not suitable for captivity			1
i am dedicated to spreading the word			0
the early deaths , the grieving , the boredom , the daily fighting and the attacks -- what we learned over two years is impossible to shake			0
once you see it , you ca n't unsee it			0
my hope is that we take the " @entity42 " momentum and use it to help evolve us out of animals for entertainment			1
these silly marine park tricks are of no social , educational or conservational value			0
we advocate , instead , for captive killer whales to be retired into sea sanctuaries where they can live out the rest of their lives in a dignified , sustainable manner			0
share your reaction to the film we ca n't throw them back into the ocean because they do n't know how to hunt , their teeth are broken from years of stress and biting on metal gates , and they 're hopped up on antibiotics and might die in the open ocean			1
however , in a sea sanctuary , where a large ocean cove is cordoned off with a net , we could monitor their health , even feed them if need be			0
it is the best alternative			0
people always wonder whether i believe @entity6 should be closed down			0
i always say no. they have tremendous financial resources and could play a key role in creating sea sanctuaries which could be a profit - making endeavor			0
i believe people would flock to a site where a killer whale is being a killer whale for the first time -- something infinitely more satisfying than seeing a killer whale dance the @entity154			0
i hope you like the film			1
i do n't know if it will change the way you feel about animals in entertainment parks			0
i did n't intend for it to do so			0
i just wanted to tell the real story			0
and i trust that once audiences are armed with the truth , they will make the best decisions by themselves and their families			0
