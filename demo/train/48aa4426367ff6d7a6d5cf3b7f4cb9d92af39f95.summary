-- a recent , widely discussed column in @entity2 rekindled an old debate about women , drinking and rape			1
it argued that young women should not become intoxicated because studies have shown that drinking , and the incoherence it produces , can lead to rape			1
last week , in an article in @entity15 law enforcement officials identified alcohol as " the no. 1 date rape drug , " and health care providers urged women not to conduct themselves in ways that increase the likelihood of sexual assault			1
the conclusion that these articles draw from studies and health professionals show just how far we have not come in understanding the inextricable link between power , violence , misogyny and rape culture			1
indeed , some who have contributed to this dialogue have come perilously close to blaming the victims of rape for their own attack			2
in @entity40 , @entity42 's student - run newspaper , student @entity39 last week , argued that " if the media would focus more attention on the fact that the majority of the women who are sexually assaulted are intoxicated , as opposed to stating and restating how horrible the perpetrator is , then maybe young women would start to listen			1
" @entity42 student op - ed links drinking irresponsibly with rape focus more attention on the drinking habits of women than on the viciousness of rapists ? as @entity62 -- the founder of @entity64 's @entity63 , a group that aims to cut sexual violence -- recently told me , " rapists are rapists , regardless , and it 's dangerous to focus on telling potential victims what not to do rather than focusing on punishments for rapists			1
" warning women about heavy drinking places the burden of not being sexually assaulted squarely on the shoulders of victims , and when they are raped this twisted dynamic often leads them to blame themselves for their own mauling			2
this is particularly disturbing because there is no female behavioral pattern that will thwart an assailant who is determined to harm them			0
the bottom line is that the victims of rape should not be expected to have forestalled their attack , and are never to blame for it , even if they are a drunken " hot messes " at the afterparty			1
my mother and other feminist mentors taught me at a young age that rape is about power , control and the more widespread problems embedded in our enduringly misogynistic society			2
many men believe that women , as allegedly weaker people , should be conquered , and that rape is merely an assertion of inherent masculinist supremacy			1
many men simply do not subscribe to women 's historian @entity102 's " radical notion that women are , " in fact , " human beings			1
" we need to look no further for evidence of this than the @entity110 , @entity109 , incident in 2012 in which a teenage girl was sexually assaulted , was dehumanized , and then blamed and vilified by some in her community and beyond , while others appeared to lament that the futures of her football - hero assailants were ruined by their rape conviction			2
in a similar case in @entity121 , @entity122 , this year , a teenage girl alleged she 'd been raped , the sheriff " described it as a ' horrible crime ' , " declared that the perpetrators should be " punished , " and then the county attorney declined to prosecute , saying " there was not a criminal offense			0
" ( the charges were dropped , but after a wide outcry , the case was , thankfully , reopened			0
) despite these realities and the frequency with which women are subjected to sexual violence , the dialogue of late has recalled pre-feminist movement denunciations of " bad girls " who invite sexual assault by wearing provocative clothes , drinking too much and losing their wits			0
as a father of a young daughter , i find this very disturbing			0
blaming excessive drinking for sexual assault among women is like blaming someone who left their keys in their car for the theft of their vehicle			0
is leaving your keys in your car unwise ? yes			0
is it the cause of your car being stolen ? no. the person who stole your car is the responsible one			0
besides , they do not need your keys to take your car			0
sadly , the certainty of punishment for stealing a car is often much greater than the certaining of punishment for raping someone ; 97 % of rapists receive no punishment , according to an analysis by @entity174 and the @entity175			0
even if someone is being " stupid " and leaving his or her car unlocked , and it is stolen , few people will respond by saying " we should not punish the car thief because who can blame him for taking advantage ? " if we want to help protect women from sexual assault , let us do so by ridding ourselves of misogyny and moving against the source of the problem , not the victim			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			2

@entity192 : @entity194 said women could avoid rape if they did **n't** drink too much
he says it 's *ridiculous* to focus on women 's behavior and not crime of the rapist
he says women should not be expected to prevent their rape , made to feel guilt if they did **n't**
@entity192 : this discussion is *retrograde* . to prevent rape , fix misogyny , not women 's behavior
