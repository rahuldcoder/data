@entity0 , @entity1 -- new hope , more frustration			2
as the search for @entity6 turned up fresh potential clues , dozens of anguished @entity9 relatives on sunday demanded that @entity1 provide them with evidence on the fate of their loved ones aboard the missing @entity15 777			1
ideal weather conditions gave one @entity18 aircraft crew the opportunity to detect many objects in the water west of @entity22			1
it spotted four orange items of interest , took photos and sent the coordinates , but flight lt. @entity28 said the crew could n't determine whether the objects were from the airliner , which officials believe went down in the southern @entity33			1
the items were more than 2 meters ( 6.5 feet ) long , he said			2
authorities will analyze the images and then decide whether to send a ship to the debris location			1
@entity28 called the discovery of the four objects one of the " most promising leads " searchers have come across			1
the search resumed monday , with 10 aircraft and 10 boats set to look for signs of the missing plane			1
" we are searching a vast area of ocean , and we are working on quite limited information			2
nevertheless , the best brains in the world are applying themselves to this task			2
... if this mystery is solvable , we will solve it , " @entity18 prime minister @entity55 told reporters monday			1
speaking from the @entity60 base where search teams have been headquartered , @entity55 said he would n't set a time frame for how long the hunt for the missing plane could take			1
" we can keep searching for quite some time to come			0
we will keep searching for quite some time to come			0
... the intensity of our search and the magnitude of our operations is increasing , not decreasing , " he said			1
search efforts sunday ended with no confirmed sightings of debris from the plane , the @entity70 said			1
objects picked up by ships on saturday turned out to be fishing equipment and other items , officials said			1
' we want truth ' the family members arrived in @entity0 and held a news conference at their hotel , imploring officials to be more transparent			0
" we want evidence , we want truth and we want our family , " said @entity85 , the families ' designated representative			0
the crowd chanted the same words			0
" we are here to call for the following three things , " he said			0
" first , the @entity1 side should provide us with timely and comprehensive evidence and answer the families ' questions			0
" he also asked @entity1 to apologize for releasing confusing information and for announcing on march 24 that the plane had crashed even though there was no " direct evidence			1
" relatives wore white @entity102 with the words " pray for @entity6 ... return home safely			0
" we are here struck with sadness and urgency , " @entity85 said			0
" the meetings recently in @entity9 were not fruitful with ( @entity110 ) officials			0
" mixed messages family members have accused @entity1 officials of withholding information since the plane vanished more than three weeks ago			1
of the 239 people aboard the doomed jetliner , 154 were @entity9			0
last week , relatives were told everyone aboard had died			0
but @entity120 , @entity1 's acting transportation minister , told reporters saturday he had not closed the door on the hope that there could be survivors			1
flight attendant 's husband wants to give children answers , but has none frustrating search @entity132 has publicly slammed @entity1 's efforts to find the @entity15 , which went missing march 8 on a flight from @entity0 to @entity132			1
and as the frustrating three - week search resumed monday , @entity9 was among the countries scouring the choppy waters of the southern @entity33 for signs of the plane			1
ten aircraft were set to fly over the search area about 1,150 miles ( 1,850 kilometers ) west of @entity22 , @entity18 officials said			1
ten ships were also involved in the search , including the @entity18 navy ship @entity145 , which was fitted with a " black box " detector and an autonomous underwater vehicle			1
on saturday , crew members aboard a @entity9 plane dropped buoys to mark three suspected debris sites , @entity9 's state - run @entity153 reported			1
it later said sunday an orange " suspicious object " spotted by a @entity9 plane saturday turned out to be a dead jellyfish			1
amid the confusion , @entity1 said it has done its best with what it has			0
" history will judge us as a country that has been very responsible , " @entity120 said			0
relatives said they hope to meet the transport minister in @entity0			1
they also asked @entity1 to plan meetings with the various companies involved , including @entity15 , the plane 's manufacturer			1
race against time experts said the clock is ticking			0
the batteries on the flight data recorder , commonly referred to as the black box , are designed to last about 30 days			0
the plane disappeared march 8 -- 22 days ago			2
" we certainly have our challenges in front of us , " said @entity177			0
" what we 're trying to find is an acoustic emission from one of the pingers on the flight data recorder ( and ) the cockpit voice recorder			0
typically these last , the batteries last about 30 days , usually they last a little bit longer , and that 's what we 're trying to find			0
but what is critical is that the teams that are out there searching for the surface debris , they get good position data on that and they feed it back to the oceanographers , to help us determine a probable point of impact for where the aircraft went in			1
" an @entity206 pinger locator and undersea search equipment were loaded onto the @entity145			2
the ship is set to depart by monday morning , and will take up to three days to reach the search area			2
@entity211 told @entity2 's " @entity217 " that his team really needs a conclusive piece of debris to narrow down the search area , due to the range of the pinger locator			1
" we have to be careful not to send it in the wrong place , but we also wanted to get it out there as close as we can to what we believe is the right place , " he told @entity2 's @entity218			0
he said if the batteries on the recorders aboard the missing plane run out , the search would require side - scan sonar , one of which has been loaded on a search ship			1
" but like i said , without good visual confirmation of debris , which we really have not had yet , it is tough to even go in the general direction , " he said			2
' they 're still alive ' in @entity132 on saturday , some of the relatives of the missing vented their anguish in the streets			0
" they 're all still alive , my son and everyone on board ! " yelled @entity244 , 63 , whose only son was among the passengers			0
" the plane is still there , too ! they 're hiding it			2
" he held aloft a banner that read : " @entity257 's hearts are torn to pieces			0
come home soon ! " relatives implored @entity120 to redouble efforts to find the plane			2
" what they want is a commitment on our part to continue the search , and that i have given , " @entity120 said			2
" for me , as the minister responsible , this is the hardest part of my life , at the moment , " he told reporters			2
" miracles do happen , remote or otherwise , and that is the hope that the families want me to convey -- not only to the @entity1 government , @entity110 ( @entity110 ) , but also to the world at large , " he said			0
sea objects the latest data analysis shows @entity6 ended up in the southern @entity33			2
but officials have offered different assessments of exactly where it could have gone down			0
investigators shifted the search area friday after concluding that the plane had been traveling faster and burning fuel faster than they previously had thought			1
the new search area is closer to @entity18 's coast , so it takes less time to reach , meaning more area can be searched			1
it 's also marked by calmer waters			0
