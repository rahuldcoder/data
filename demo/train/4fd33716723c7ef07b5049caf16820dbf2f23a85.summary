-- @entity2 's lone abortion clinic can stay open , after a federal appeals court tuesday ruled against a law that effectively would have shut it down -- contending that it 's not right to simply pass the buck to other states			1
tuesday 's decision by the 5th @entity10 spares the @entity11 , at least for now			0
the law 's sponsor , state rep. @entity12 , said tuesday that " all the parties involved are looking " at what to do next -- including a possible appeal that could end up before the @entity19 @entity18			1
it all stems from @entity22 @entity21 , legislation signed into law in 2012 that requires abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at a local hospital			1
three doctors work in the clinic in the @entity2 capital , only one of whom meets this requirement			1
seven hospitals in and around @entity35 rebuffed the other two doctors ' requests to get the same privileges -- not because of their qualifications , per se , but because their " medical practice is inconsistent with " the hospitals ' practices			2
@entity44 's clinic faced threat of shutdown as the appeals court noted tuesday , this is n't a matter of whether abortion is legal : the @entity18 " long ago " established that it is			1
" the ultimate issue in this appeal is whether the state of @entity2 can impose a regulation that effectively will close its only abortion clinic , " the judges wrote in the prevailing opinion			1
the state had ceded this fact , contending that @entity2 residents still could get an abortion in @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 or elsewhere			1
but that did n't satisfy the appeals court			0
" we ... hold that @entity2 may not shift its obligation to respect the established constitutional rights of its citizens to another state , " the judges wrote			2
" such a proposal would not only place an undue burden on the exercise of a constitutional right , but would also disregard a state 's obligation under the principle of federalism -- applicable to all 50 states			2
" in a post on its @entity83 page , the @entity11 cheered the decision and thanked its supporters			0
" this legislation has always been about the best possible health care for women who receive an abortion , " he told @entity0			2
" i still believe that having physicians obtain privileges in a local hospital makes sense			0
" @entity12 noted that other states have similar requirements			2
one of them is @entity98 , which had its own regulation held up -- ironically , by the same federal appeals court that ruled on the @entity2 matter			0
appeals court upholds parts of @entity98 abortion law that decision found that making some women travel less than 150 miles , because of the regulations within the @entity98 law , " is not an undue burden			2
" but forcing them to cross state lines -- and allowing some states not to offer abortions while others do -- is a different matter			0
the judges on tuesday referred to a 1938 @entity18 decision involving an @entity119 being denied admission to the @entity122 's law school because of his race			0
the university system offered him , instead , a tuition stipend to go to a law school in another state			0
a common tie between that case and what 's happening with regarding to the @entity2 abortion clinic is that " a state can not lean on its sovereign neighbors to provide protection of its citizens ' federal constitutional rights , " the judges said			1
@entity139 , head of the @entity140 , applauded tuesday 's appeals court ruling on @entity2 while acknowledging its future is still uncertain			1
" for far too long , women in @entity2 have been teetering on the precipice of a reality similar to the dark days before @entity147 , " @entity139 said in a news release			0
" this is unacceptable , unconstitutional and contrary to the consensus of the strong majority of @entity19 who do not wish to see @entity147 's constitutional protections overturned			0
" @entity12 thinks that @entity22 @entity153 should still stand , contending that it includes a sensible measure to safeguard women 's health			1
" i think it 's a very important piece of legislation that passed the @entity161 , " the @entity157 from @entity158 said			0
" and we 'll have to see what happens next			0
" opinion : @entity2 's end run around abortion @entity0 's @entity167 contributed to this report .			1

new : rep. @entity12 disappointed ; he says his bill seeks to give women best possible care
new : @entity2 's lone abortion clinic cheers the ruling ; supporters say fight is n't over
state law : all clinic doctors had to get privileges at local hospitals ; they could not
the state argued that those wanting abortions could go to *nearby* states
