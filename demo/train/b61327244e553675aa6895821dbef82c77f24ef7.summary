@entity0 is joining @entity2 's " @entity1 " -- one of the most visible morning tv shows in @entity5			1
in the press announcement , @entity6 said of her , " @entity0 brings us intelligence as well as warmth and humor			1
she can be serious and outrageous			0
" let 's talk about the outrages			2
much of the criticism toward hiring @entity0 , including mine , has focused on her stance against vaccines			1
she has repeatedly claimed that that vaccines played a major role in giving her son autism , that he " recovered " from autism thanks to a special diet , and the government and medical establishment did not bother to investigate her son 's recovery			1
she argues that we vaccinate too much , too quickly , and that the research on a link between autism and vaccines should continue			2
her charity , @entity34 , continues to question the safety of vaccines and sponsors events starring anti-vaccine advocates , such as @entity39 , a disgraced @entity40 doctor			1
let us be clear : the statements she has made about vaccines are deceitful and dangerous			1
if you 're curious about the anti-vaccine scare and @entity0 's part in spreading misinformation , read " @entity50 " by @entity51 or follow the work of @entity49			1
if you think a few parents choosing not to vaccinate their children has no impact on your life , @entity49 and @entity51 ( and the @entity56 and pretty much every pediatrician ) will gladly refute that misconception			0
but beyond the damage she 's already caused , i 'm worried about what she 's going to do next , now that she has an even bigger platform			1
@entity0 has displayed a willingness to leap into new belief systems and promote them to people hungry for answers			1
her journey through the world of hunch - based parenting has taken a number of twists and turns			0
in 2006 , as recounted by @entity51 , a random woman told @entity0 that her son was a " @entity78 " and @entity0 an " @entity79			1
" suddenly , @entity0 plunged into the new age philosophy of @entity79 moms and their @entity78 children -- believed to be the next phase of human evolution			1
that never took off so she dumped it and moved on to the anti-vaccine movement			2
she landed time with @entity88 and @entity89 , and wrote multiple books on " healing autism			0
" although her tv and movie career eventually stalled , her popularity among desperate parents , discredited scientists , sellers of snake oil , and conspiracy theorists has apparently propelled her back into the spotlight			2
" @entity1 " is watched by millions of people , many of whom are parents of young children , a staple market for daytime tv			1
parents are more likely to jump at " fads " rather than sticking to " evidence - based " parenting			0
it 's hard to blame them for this characteristic -- they are primed to be afraid			1
parents are told that unless they buy a given product , their child will get sick , learn too slowly , fail to flourish , or even die			0
being a parent requires so many leaps of faith on a day - to - day basis			0
we just hope and pray that we 're getting it mostly right			0
when someone claims to have answers , especially someone with the intelligence and charisma of a @entity0 , parents are easy targets			1
in the world of special needs parenting , a world to which both @entity0 and i belong , parents are even more afraid and seek answers			1
doctors present parents like us with long lists of risk factors and complicated prognoses			0
the days are hard , laden with therapies , doctor visits , worries about medical expenses , estate planning , schooling , bullying , transportation , and so much more			0
all of the fears become magnified			0
i do n't want you to pity parents of children with special needs , but do understand that many of us are looking for answers to questions we barely understand			0
parents of children with autism , in particular , have proven especially susceptible to fraud and fear			0
life with autism can be hard			0
studies found that stress levels for primary caregivers of children with autism compare to those of soldiers deployed in combat zones			0
some parents have not only followed @entity0 's decision to create a gluten - free / casein - free diet , as still advocated on her organization 's website , but have pursued much more extreme measures			1
at this year 's @entity179 conference in @entity181 , many sessions focused on costly stem - cell treatments , though no science supports the idea that injecting a child with stem cells will cure autism			2
in previous years , panels at the same conference have promoted the practice of giving autistic children bleach orally and as an enema -- all as part of a detox method ( predicated on the idea that autism is an environmental disease )			2
parents who do this are not cruel ; they 're just looking for hope			0
enter @entity0 , a woman who evangelizes			1
she jumps at fads , hunches , intuitions and really bad ideas			2
then she builds institutions to promote them with the full - throated roar of a new convert			0
@entity0 has profited handsomely from her outrageous views			2
she is intelligent , funny and persuasive			0
she writes books that sell very well			0
her organizations throw successful events			0
she is a tireless promoter of her ideas			2
and now she 's a host on " @entity1			1
" what idea will she seize on next ? what dangerous fad will she claim needs more study ? how many parents , at home in the morning , will be persuaded ? i 'm deeply disappointed that @entity6 and @entity2 have decided to let us find out the answers to these troubling questions .			1
