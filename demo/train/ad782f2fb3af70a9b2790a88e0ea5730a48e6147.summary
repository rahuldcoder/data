@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's triggered an emotional controversy			1
the pardons of convicted killers by outgoing gov. @entity7 has forced @entity1 to take a look at an ageless program that employed violent men -- including convicted murderers -- inside the governor 's mansion and put those men on a fast track to a full pardon -- and freedom			1
the program , known as the governor 's @entity20 program , is now front - and - center at the @entity1 capitol			1
no one seems to know how long the program has been in effect , or how it got started			1
" it 's almost closed , " said @entity1 state rep. @entity27 , a @entity28 who 's helping to spearhead legislation to change the program and the governor 's power to pardon			1
" you ca n't go into this capitol dome and ask somebody to tell you about that particular program ... to tell you how they 're ( inmates are ) vetted , who is chosen , why they are chosen or anything else , " @entity27 told @entity2			1
what is known is that in his final days in office , @entity7 signed full and complete pardons for five violent offenders serving life sentences -- including four men who had committed murder			1
these men were trusties -- selected by the @entity50 because of their exemplary behavioral record while in prison to work at a variety of jobs , including as servants and handymen in the governor 's mansion			1
@entity2 was able to track down one of the pardoned murderers in @entity1			0
almost 11 years to the day that he shot his wife in the back and killed her , in front of a room full of witnesses , @entity61 spoke with @entity2 's @entity67			2
@entity67 : " what kinds of things would you do at the governor 's mansion ? " @entity61 : " i did housekeeping			1
washed cars and stuff like that			0
i cooked with the chef			0
" @entity67 : " how long were you there ? " @entity61 : " three years			2
" @entity67 : " what was the change like for going from prison to the governor 's mansion ? " @entity61 : " well , first i had to get used to it because i had been in prison so long			1
i had to adjust to it , but down the road it was ok			0
everybody was nice to you , treat you nice			0
you just do your chores			0
" @entity67 : " better living conditions ? " @entity61 : " yes , sir			0
@entity67 : " you 'd have your own room ? " @entity61 : " yes , sir			0
you 'd have your own room			0
you 'd have your own room			0
you 'd get up and it 's time to go to work			1
you eat your breakfast and go to work			2
@entity67 : " and this was always at the governor 's mansion ? " @entity61 : " yes , sir			1
@entity67 : " could you leave ? " @entity61 : " no. you could n't go nowhere			0
" that prison inmates like @entity61 -- who pleaded guilty in the death of his wife , @entity108 -- were afforded such a situation is the very thing that infuriates @entity111			1
his sister was @entity61 's wife , gunned down after the couple had argued at an after - hours club			2
bonds helped raise his sister 's two young children			2
" how do you get a convicted murderer ... to go work at the governor 's mansion ? " he asked incredulously			1
" i do n't know what he could have done			0
you 've got some folks that can do some pretty devious things to get what they want , " he told @entity2			0
" the governor must not have no grandkids coming in ... cause i would n't trust them folks , " added @entity111 , referring to the trusties			2
@entity7 has defended his decision			1
@entity7 says he believes in second chances and that men who committed crimes of passion are least likely to repeat their crimes			1
" i have no doubt in my mind that these men have repented , have been redeemed , have come back hard - working to prepare themselves to go out in the world			0
i have no question in my life , " he said in an interview with @entity146			0
" when my grandchildren are over at the governor 's mansion , we trust them to play with and to be looked out for by these people			1
if i trusted them to be around my grandchildren , i think that makes a pretty plain statement , " he said			0
according to the state @entity50 , prisoners selected for the program can not have a drug or a sex - crimes conviction			1
they must also show that they are interested in bettering themselves while in prison			2
women generally are not selected to be a part of the trusty program , because the @entity167 forbids mixing men and women together			1
but opponents of the program say it shows tremendous leniency by taking violent individuals out of prison and into the confines of the governor 's mansion , where they have their own rooms -- and a path to that fast track to freedom with a pardon			1
" it takes 12 people to put somebody in prison and one man ( the governor ) gets to release him because he gave him a good car wash or served dinner right			1
it 's wrong , " says @entity192			2
one of the recently pardoned trusties , @entity195 , was given a life sentence in the shooting death of her sister			0
@entity195 was convicted of shooting @entity200 in the head as she held their 6 - week - old son			0
i ca n't even fathom ... because he ( @entity195 ) lives in his mansion , and he speaks to him , and gets to sit down and talk to the governor , that this man ( @entity7 ) does n't take into consideration that he shot @entity200 in her head with a child in her arms			1
" according to the @entity214 , found online , inmates convicted of murder , and those serving life sentences are ineligible for the program -- raising the question of how and why @entity61 , @entity195 and others managed to be in the program			1
a @entity50 spokesperson did not return @entity2 's calls for an explanation			2
the men are constantly surrounded by the governor 's security staff at the governor 's mansion -- considered a secure location			1
the men who are selected are put through a further background check by the @entity233 , the agency assigned to protect the governor			1
according to a law enforcement source , security is very tight			0
" one strike and you 're out			0
so they ( inmates ) are on their best behavior always			2
whatever they tell the inmates to do has to be followed			2
they better be toeing the line , " the source said			0
" they would n't choose anyone that might grab a kitchen knife and do something			0
they have to be people they feel they can watch			2
" but the program appears to give these men direct access to the governor -- a privilege that most prison inmates obviously do not enjoy			1
@entity61 told @entity2 he saw @entity7 practically every day			1
" he 'd ask me how my children were doing and stuff like that , " @entity61 told @entity2 's @entity67			2
" he 'd ask how everybody was doing and i said everybody was doing just fine			0
and we 'd move along			0
he 'd go and do his work and i 'd go and do my work			2
" if you want to go talk to him , he 'll talk to you , " @entity61 added			0
@entity67 asked , " really , you could just walk up to him and say , ' how are you ? ' " " how you doing , mr. @entity7 ? " @entity61 responded			1
he had his work to do , too			2
" @entity61 described the outgoing governor as " @entity274 ... nice ... really nice individual guy			2
" asked if he discussed a pardon with @entity7 , @entity277 responded : " no. i never asked nothing about that			1
" " it was just assumed that eventually , by working in the mansion you 'd get that pardon , " said @entity67			2
" tradition , " responded @entity61			0
" that 's what they call it			0
before he got into office			0
it 's been going on for years			0
" the @entity50 said research was still under way to determine how long the trusty program has been going on , but department officials could not say how many inmates have gone through the trusty program , or how many of those trusties were eventually pardoned			1
but now there 's a new governor in town			1
former lt. gov. @entity301 was sworn in last week			0
@entity301 has said the road to a pardon will no longer run through the @entity1 governor 's mansion			1
@entity301 would not consent to an interview with @entity2 , but his director of communications said in an e-mail that changes have already begun			0
" the day @entity301 was sworn in , the mansion trusty program ended in its antiquated 50 year old form , " wrote @entity310			1
" governor @entity301 , on tuesday ( last week ) discontinued the practice of convicts spending the night on the mansion grounds and the tradition of pardoning the mansion trusties			1
further , he is currently working towards phasing out the use of violent offenders at the @entity320			0
" @entity61 , meanwhile , says he deserves his pardon , despite only serving 11 years of a life sentence for killing his wife			0
" well , it 's by the grace of @entity326			0
that 's what @entity326 does -- @entity326 opens doors that no man can close			2
i 'm a child of @entity326			0
that 's what i believe , " he told @entity2			0
he also says that @entity7 , as governor , had the right to let him go free , as @entity61 put it , " when the @entity337 touched his heart			1

it 's not clear how long the governor 's @entity20 program has been going on
selected inmates work and live inside the governor 's mansion
controversy over former gov. @entity7 's pardons has put the program in the *spotlight*
