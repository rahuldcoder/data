@entity0 , @entity1 -- we were on a rough track surrounded by fields of wheat and barley when the little blue @entity8 came into sight			1
the car lurched towards us , kicking up a trail of white dust			2
within 20 miles of @entity0 , drivers routinely quiz each other for information on the road ahead -- the risks and roadblocks			1
and then the car , barely the size of a @entity22 and at least 20 years old , disgorged its occupants : no fewer than eight people , three generations of the @entity26 family			2
they had fled the shelling in @entity0 , a city in eastern @entity1 held for two months by @entity31 separatists and now under persistent shelling and mortar fire from @entity1 forces			1
but after a week sleeping in tents in a forest , battered by thunderstorms , they just wanted to go home -- to a city without electricity , gas or running water			1
we followed them along rutted tracks and lanes on a twisting route into the city , probably the only way in or out			1
the @entity1 army has blocked the main roads around @entity0 , although president @entity53 has promised to create ' green corridors ' to help civilians escape the fighting			1
waved through a couple of separatist checkpoints , they finally made it			2
compared to a month ago , @entity0 seemed half - empty , the city 's remaining residents looking drawn and frightened			1
the thud of artillery and chatter of gunfire echoed around apartment blocks			2
jagged shards of glass lay everywhere , the remnants of windows blown out by mortar fire or shells			1
the roof of a gas station hung precariously , twisted by what appeared to have been a direct hit			2
there were a few charred vehicles , some small craters			2
' no electricity , no water ' when the @entity84 arrived at a rundown apartment block , the neighbors were surprised to see them back			2
who would return to this ? they asked			2
but @entity89 was just relieved her home was still there			2
" of course i 'm worried to be here but home is home			0
there is no electricity and no water but at least it 's better than living in tents in the woods , " she told us after unpacking her few belongings			0
" we had nowhere to stay , " @entity89 said -- and people elsewhere were reluctant or unable to provide shelter			0
she knew of only four friends who had left			0
they had gone to @entity107 , a city to the north , but had not been welcome			1
@entity109 said she was giving tranquilizers to her children -- age ten and two -- to calm them down			0
but they were already beginning to recognize the difference between various weapons			0
an old man wandered past			0
was there any water here ? he asked			0
try the fountains , someone suggested			0
others said they were using buckets to collect water from lakes on the outskirts of town			0
pro-russian separatists , in various uniforms but all armed , wandered the deserted squares or careered through the streets on scooters , assault weapons slung over their shoulders , weaving past downed power cables			1
but there were fewer of them than before			0
most , it seemed , were on the outskirts of town in defensive positions			0
the office of the self - declared mayor , @entity145 , had lost its revolutionary brio			1
in fact @entity145 was nowhere to be found			0
a statement attributed to the military commander of the separatists in the @entity151 , @entity152 , and carried by the @entity154 news agency @entity153 said : " the so - called people 's mayor @entity145 was removed from office for activities which are incompatible with the objectives of the civil administration			1
" call for negotiations following the killing of an aide to @entity165 , the self - declared mayor of @entity151 , in the city at the weekend , there is growing speculation here of dissent among the separatists ' ranks -- though its leadership accused @entity173 of being behind the murder			1
@entity175 , a man in his fifties got off his bicycle to talk to us			0
this had gone on too long , he said			0
" they need to negotiate , they should somehow settle this			0
or the @entity1 government should say : ' that 's it			1
' " the support among some townspeople for the separatist groups that seized the town 's administrative and security buildings early in april seemed to have given way to a weariness , a yearning for an end to the uncertainty and the constant threat of bombardment			1
no - one could be sure who had fired the mortar that had wrecked an apartment building and sprayed the wall of a school with shrapnel			1
maybe it was poor targeting by separatists who had been using the cover of a church to fire at @entity1 positions -- or equally poor targeting by the army			1
those who have basements spend much of the evening sheltering ; they said the worst of the fire comes after 8pm			1
others have no basement to flee into			1
one man said that when the bombing started he and his family would hide in the corridor of their house , away from the windows , for hours on end			1
they could n't go into the kitchen or bathroom			0
@entity230 , rocket fire as we reached the bus station , a furious summer thunderstorm erupted			2
the potholes quickly filled with brown water , the thunder cracked -- or was that another round of rocket fire from somewhere ? @entity239 , a middle - aged woman with a look of resignation on her face was taking shelter , hoping against hope that she would be able to get home			1
she had nothing good to say about @entity53			0
" we call him bloody @entity53 , " she said			0
" a lot of people have died but no - one is talking about it			2
they should pull the army back , " she said			0
@entity109 , an elderly woman in a flowing blue dress and clutching two shopping bags sat on a bench nearby			0
she had braved the journey from a nearby village to @entity0 to collect her pension			1
but the bank , she told us , had been destroyed			0
now she had to get home			0
suddenly , a puppy emerged from one of her shopping bags			0
she had found it and was taking it home			0
as the downpour continued , the patter of rain occasionally interrupted by bursts of machine gun fire in the distance , she gave the puppy some milk -- before traipsing away across the puddles in search of a ride home			2
we found her at a roadblock an hour later , standing among bronzed separatists whose position was overlooked by @entity1 heavy armor			1
the puppy was at her feet			0
we made room for the pair of them and dropped them off at her home in a village just a few miles from @entity0 -- a picture of rural tranquility compared to the beleaguered city			1

@entity0 is under persistent shelling and mortar fire from @entity1 forces
