that represents a 6 percent jump from @entity9 weekend			0
however , nearly every wide release saw their grosses rise compared to last weekend			0
the weekend after @entity9 has historically been a strong box - office period , as many families are still on break but are no longer occupied with holiday preparations			0
" @entity6 , " the fourth entry in the action franchise , has now cumulatively tallied $ 134.1 million , surpassing the final gross of " mission : @entity21 " ( $ 134 million )			1
the @entity23 movie , which was helmed by @entity25 animation director @entity24 , will now attempt to catch up with the first " mission : impossible , " which collected $ 181 million in 1996			1
that figure should be within reach for " @entity6			1
" in second place was " @entity30 : a @entity32 , " which rose 9 percent for $ 22.1 million			1
the sequel has taken in $ 132.1 million in 17 days			1
the original " @entity30 , " by comparison , had earned $ 165.2 million by this point			1
although " a @entity32 " trails its predecessor , it is slowly closing the gap			0
this is because the first " @entity30 " opened on christmas weekend , thereby inflating its initial figures			1
" shadows , " on the other hand , debuted on the ( typically slow ) weekend before @entity9 , and is just now benefiting from a @entity43 bump			0
in other words , the first " @entity30 " started out of the gate much quicker , but " shadows " is picking up steam			1
the sequel probably wo n't have enough momentum to reach its predecessor 's final tally of $ 209 million , but the gap between the two films should be a lot smaller than many people initially thought			2
the same holds true for " @entity57 : chipwrecked , " which jumped an incredible 45 percent for $ 18.3 million			1
the rodent threequel has so far earned $ 94.6 million in 17 days			2
in the same time frame , the 2007 original had grossed $ 141.4 million and its 2009 sequel had amassed $ 165.4 million			2
despite " @entity65 's " slow start , it has been holding up well and should finish its domestic run with a respectable number			0
in its first full weekend , @entity69 's equine epic " @entity68 " finished fourth with $ 16.9 million			2
whereas most films dropped from friday to saturday this weekend ( on account of saturday being @entity72 ) , " @entity68 " actually jumped 20 percent on saturday			2
one possible explanation could be that the movie is drawing a decidedly older audience that was n't about to let @entity72 get in the way of its moviegoing plans			0
according to @entity79 , 79 percent of " @entity68 's " audience was at least 25 years old			0
the @entity81 hopeful has so far collected $ 43 million and is on its way to becoming a genuine holiday hit			2
finally , in fifth , was @entity86 's " @entity85 , " which rose 28 percent for $ 16.3 million			1
the $ 90 million adaptation of @entity89 's bestselling novel has so far grossed a decent but somewhat disappointing $ 57.1 million in 12 days			2
in limited release , " @entity91 , " starring @entity92 as former @entity94 prime minister @entity93 , debuted to an outstanding $ 221,800 at four theaters -- that 's a per - location average of $ 55,450			0
the acclaimed @entity98 drama " a separation , " which is practically assured an @entity81 nomination for @entity101 , opened to a solid $ 66,600 in three theaters			0
and the @entity104 drama " @entity105 " started its run with a merely okay $ 49,700 at four locations			0
mission : impossible -- ghost protocol -- $ 31.3 mil 2			1
@entity30 : a game of shadows -- $ 22.1 mil 3			1
@entity57 : @entity65 -- $ 18.3 mil 4			1
@entity68 -- $ 16.9 mil 5			0
