-- one of the most sensational and infamous murder cases in modern @entity3 history returned to a courtroom monday as former @entity6 doctor @entity5 sought a new trial in the killing of his family			1
@entity5 was back in court in @entity11 , @entity12 , as his lawyers argued new evidence should be heard by a jury			1
" we feel like evidence is coming in the way we want it to			2
so we are very pleased at this point , " @entity5 lawyer @entity19 told @entity0 affilliate @entity21			1
@entity5 is serving a life sentence in the 1970 slayings of his wife and two young daughters in their @entity28 home			1
the 68 - year - old has long maintained that they were beaten and stabbed to death by a group of hippies who broke into their homes , chanting " kill the pigs " and " acid 's groovy			1
" @entity5 and his lawyers contend that dna tests show that hair samples found underneath the fingernail of one of the victims did not come from a member of the @entity5 family and presumably were from one of the killers			1
the defense will also try to prove that the prosecutor in the criminal trial threatened @entity50 , a witness who had earlier confessed to being in the @entity5 home the night of the murders			1
@entity5 told investigators that he was at home , sleeping on a couch , when he heard screaming			1
he awoke to find three men and one woman , whom he described as having blond hair and wearing a floppy hat			0
he was found with two stab wounds and a collapsed lung			0
while an @entity64 inquiry into the murders recommended that @entity5 not be court - martialed , a civilian federal jury found him guilty in 1979			1
he has been behind bars since 1982			0
but in 2011 , a federal appeals court ruled that @entity5 was entitled to an evidentiary hearing			1
during @entity5 's trial , @entity50 said she was not present and had no involvement in the killings			1
the defense insists the prosecutor , @entity74 , pressured @entity75 to alter her testimony			0
@entity50 , who had a long history of drug and alcohol abuse , died in 1983			0
@entity80 would not comment on the charge , citing monday 's hearing			2
" i was the prosecutor in the case , and i did that job to the best of my ability , " @entity74 told @entity0			0
" i did it in great reliance of the evidence the government had , and we presented an honorable case and it was straightforward and it was based on good and competent evidence			0
and i agree with the jury 's verdict			0
" the @entity5 saga has captivated the public 's attention for decades			2
it also became the focus of the controversial and popular book " @entity105 " by @entity104			0
on television , millions watched a miniseries about the case and a memorable " @entity110 " interview with @entity5			2
this month , @entity112 - winning documentary filmmaker @entity111 spoke to @entity0 about " a wilderness of error : the trials of @entity5 , " his new book on the subject			2
" we 've been sold a bill of goods about this case , " @entity111 said			0
" it 's as phony as a three - dollar bill			0
" " there are many things about this case that rub me the wrong way , but principal among them was how the jury was asked to make decisions about his guilt or innocence with incomplete evidence ; evidence that was withheld , corrupted and suppressed			0
" author seeks to prove @entity5 is innocent			2

@entity139 : " we are very pleased at this point , " @entity5 lawyer says after first day
@entity5 was *convicted* of killing his wife and two daughters in the 1970s
@entity5 blames a group of hippies for the murders
