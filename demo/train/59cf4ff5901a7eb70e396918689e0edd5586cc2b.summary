-- while the likes of @entity2 and @entity3 strut their stuff at @entity5 , spare a thought for the grass under their feet -- which will take a double pounding in the next two months			1
just 20 days after the men 's final at the @entity15 , the tennis competition at the @entity12 will begin -- and the team working on the famous courts are keeping their fingers crossed that this week 's inclement weather does not cause any further delays			1
@entity21 from the @entity22 ( @entity23 ) gives @entity5 head groundsman @entity24 and his staff expert scientific advice on that preparation and admits that any delay into a third week would be a serious problem			1
" they do n't want to lose time because they are already on such a fine edge and even a day would mean you lose 5 % of your preparation , and that could be crucial , " he told @entity0			2
ten of @entity5 's courts will be used for the @entity38 and it 's going to prove @entity40 's biggest challenge -- coming in his final year in the job , after more than two decades of involvement			1
preparation is the key , and the @entity46 ( @entity47 ) insisted on a trial run at @entity5 after the @entity38 were awarded to the @entity50 capital			1
trial run " we worked on them just a couple of years ago to prove to @entity47 that we could do that within a short period of time , get the courts back in pristine condition , " @entity24 told @entity0			1
but trial run or not , it 's still a daunting prospect with little room for error			0
the grass must be cut to an exact 8 millimeters for optimum performance , and @entity40 and his team have to keep a wary eye on that unpredictable @entity50 weather -- ground temperature and humidity levels are constantly measured			0
for this reason , the expertise of scientists and agronomists is so important			0
@entity23 has been advising @entity5 for over a decade			1
at its main testing center in a little corner of @entity81 , in northern @entity78 , its staff have recreated their own versions of @entity83 -- trialing different varieties of grass to provide the best and most resilient surface			1
" we can test the grasses that they may use in the future here , " said @entity21 , @entity23 's head of turf grass biology			2
" we can whittle them down , we can get rid of the chaff , hopefully keep the wheat for them			0
" best grass over the years , @entity21 and his colleagues have come to the conclusion that perennial ryegrass provides the best surface , both in terms of wear and playing characteristics			0
" in essence we 've moved from one grass species which was inappropriate for @entity5 , to one which was the best for @entity5 , " says @entity23 chief executive @entity103			1
the company has grown to employ up to 85 people , and @entity5 forms just part of their work			1
the cricket pitches at @entity112 , the fairways and greens of @entity115 , the home of golf , and the football turf for @entity119 in @entity120 and @entity121 have all had their grass tried and tested at @entity23 's research center in @entity124			1
when the pitch at the @entity119 game between @entity128 and the @entity121 dramatically flooded , experts from @entity23 were on hand to monitor its drying out			0
they had advised using a vacuum pump system when the @entity132 in @entity133 was constructed , and it paid off			0
weather gods the team working on @entity5 and the @entity38 had been keeping their fingers crossed for the perfect growing conditions at @entity139 in july and august			1
" two weeks of wall - to - wall sunshine , not unbearably hot , with the odd contrast in conditions , perhaps a bit of rain , would make our job much easier , " said @entity21			0
but true to form the @entity50 weather has misbehaved during the championships and the inevitable rain delays have left organizers with more than a few headaches			2
for @entity21 the effect of such a varied climate on growing conditions is the bread and butter of his work			0
he has installed micro weather stations at @entity5 to aid his research , as well as digging a small hole on @entity83 to measure moisture levels			1
" it 's quite an important hole because it allows me to measure how much moisture there is at different depths , " @entity21 said			0
" @entity166 is needed for the grass to grow , but it 's also needed in the sense that we 've got to dry it out to get the ball to bounce			0
" surprise tactic the playing characteristics of the courts at @entity5 have been the subject of debate and no little controversy over the years , with claims it now favors baseline play rather than classic serve and volley			1
@entity21 said the trend was more to do with the strength of the players , their rackets and the balls that are being used , rather than the surfaces being prepared			0
" players now use serve and volley as a surprise tactic rather than the norm , " he said			0
during @entity24 's time at the @entity15 , he has seen that change of tactics reflected on the worn parts of his courts			1
" when i first started here , the players used to serve and run in to return the ball , they used to check and stop and wear the grass out and there 's a patch in the middle there			0
that slowly but surely moved further back every year , until it 's completely disappeared , " he said			2
without the likes of @entity208 and @entity209 charging forward to scuff up the grass in the middle of the court , the task of the groundsman has become rather easier , particularly with the tight @entity38 deadline in mind			1
@entity24 and his team will begin their @entity38 work even while play is still taking place on the show courts			1
" we know the baseline is more worn than the rest of it , but by the time you get a bit of water on it , it starts to green up a bit , " he said			2
nature 's way the secret is using pre-germinated , or pre-grown seed , which is sowed into the worn patches			0
" we 've got to try to get some grass back in there , in a very short space of time , " @entity24 said			1
" within a few days it will be up , hopefully , and we 'll be preparing the courts			2
" and bearing this in mind , there is a plus side to the constant drizzle that is coming out of the cloudy skies of @entity249 in what has proved a pretty miserable summer			0
" for growing grass , rain is a bonus , " said @entity21 , adding that water from the sky falls more evenly than that supplied by artificial sprinklers			0
@entity21 believes that the soil texture underneath the grass is just as important in determining the playing characteristics , but knows that when hosting the biggest sports show on earth , aesthetics are important			2
" the idea is that we get the court to look the way it 's going to look on the opening monday of @entity5			2
" but he warned : " it all comes back to nature , and nature ca n't be rushed			0
" if the joint efforts of all those involved are ultimately successful , perhaps the @entity273 could award a special gold medal to @entity40 and his extended team -- because working around the clock , they may well have deserved it .			2
