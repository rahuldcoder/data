@entity0 -- the @entity3 government said thursday it will stop a convoy of cargo and passenger ships filled with supplies and headed to @entity8 to break a blockade imposed by @entity3 in 2007			1
government officials said wednesday they have given the @entity12 instructions to reroute the flotilla to @entity15 port in @entity3 , where the supplies will be unloaded and transferred to @entity8			1
@entity16 , an @entity3 government spokesman , called the flotilla " a cheap political stunt			1
" " if they were really interested in the well being of the people of @entity8 , they would have accepted the offers of @entity24 or @entity3 to transfer humanitarian aid to the people of @entity8 , along with the other 15 thousand tons sent every week , " he said			1
the convoy , which left various @entity29 ports , is organized by two major groups : the @entity32 movement , a @entity34 human rights organization , and the @entity36 movement , a @entity38 humanitarian relief foundation affiliated with the @entity39			0
organizers said the convoy is carrying 10,000 tons of construction material , medical equipment and school supplies , and about 750 activists of different nationalities			0
@entity3 's @entity47 , said @entity48 , its director - general , has summoned the ambassadors of @entity38 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 -- the countries from which the flotilla set sail -- and " clarified the state of @entity3 's official position , which declares the flotilla an absolute provocation : there is no shortage of humanitarian aid to @entity8 , as food products , fuel and supplies are constantly transferred into the @entity8 by the international organizations			1
" the flotilla is " invited to dock at @entity72 , to unload their cargo and transfer it to @entity8 , after a security check , either via the @entity3 authorities or via the humanitarian organizations , " the ministry said			1
@entity78 , a member of @entity3 's parliament , the @entity79 , and a passenger on the flotilla , called it a " humanitarian campaign for the 1.5 million @entity85 people who @entity3 put in jail for about the last four years without allowing building material , without educational material , without food into the @entity8			1
" @entity3 destroyed 165 schools and more than 100 ( factories ) and destroyed tens of thousands of houses without enabling the @entity85 to rebuild their homes and their lives , " @entity78 said			2
" this is a very strong political message towards @entity3 and towards the @entity97 world that stood silent regarding what is happening in @entity8			1
" @entity3 imposed the naval blockade on @entity8 after the @entity100 forcefully took control of @entity8 in 2007 , ousting the @entity103 movement headed by @entity105 president @entity104			1
@entity16 argued that the activists maintain a double standard when it comes to @entity100 ' actions			0
" they call themselves human rights activists , but they remain silent when it comes to @entity100 ' deliberate targeting of @entity3 civilians and the brutalities of the @entity100 regime in @entity8 , which has crushed political opposition , suppressed independent media and has locked up hundreds of political opponents			1
" @entity120 , an @entity3 @entity121 legal expert , said , " the naval blockade has been imposed by @entity3 because @entity3 is currently in a state of armed conflict with the @entity100 regime that controls @entity8			1
" under international maritime law , when a maritime blockade is in effect , no vessels can enter the blockaded area			0
maritime blockades are a legitimate measure under international law , and may be implemented as part of an armed conflict at sea , @entity3 officials have said			2
" the objective of the boats is to break @entity3 's siege on @entity8 , to break @entity3 's blockade on @entity8			1
the material that we have on board are all of the materials that @entity3 denied to the people of @entity8 like cement , building supplies , educational supplies etc , " said @entity142 , co-founder of @entity32			2
" we do not accept the siege on @entity8 , " said @entity78			2
" ... @entity3 does not want a siege			2
it wants a silent siege			0
@entity3 does not want occupation , it wants a silent occupation			0
it wants its policies to go without criticisms of the world			0
that 's why it wants to stop the flotilla and also avoid coverage of the event , " she said			0
" ... this is an important aim of @entity3 , is to stop the cameras in order for the participants who are participating in this flotilla and the others who are following it not to see the aggression of the @entity3 army , but i think this does not threaten us and it does not bring fear among us , " she said			1
@entity176 , father of captive @entity3 soldier @entity176 , told @entity1 he offered through his lawyer to attempt to convince the @entity3 government to let the flotilla arrive in @entity8 if participants would pass aid , including letters and medicine , to his son			1
the organizers of the convoy , including @entity187 , refused , he said , telling him their main purpose is to break the siege			0
@entity176 has been held captive since june 2006 , when @entity85 militants from @entity8 captured him			0
@entity176 says his son has been kept in total isolation for the past four years , a violation of international conventions and against international law			0
there have been eight naval convoys to @entity8 until now , and @entity3 has allowed three to dock at the @entity8 port			2
@entity3 @entity121 spokesman @entity47 said that since january 2009 , more than a million tons of humanitarian supplies entered @entity8 from @entity3			2
the most efficient system to transfer goods to @entity8 is through the land crossings , @entity200 said			0
asked if he was concerned about being arrested , @entity78 told @entity1 , " i am not worried because i am not doing anything against the law			0
what i do is according to human rights , according to international values and according to universal values , so it is not against the law			0
" i am ( a ) @entity79 member , and this is part of my political responsibility , " she said			1
" it is part of my human responsibility			0
this is not against the law to aid people , to help and support ( those ) who are under siege ... i think the side that is breaking the law , international law , and breaking the human values is @entity3 and not anyone else			2
