-- @entity3 @entity2 captain @entity1 plans to emulate the decision of his @entity6 counterpart @entity5 and select former world number one @entity7 for next year 's contest with @entity10			1
@entity7 , a 14 - time major winner , has struggled with form and fitness since problems in his personal life emerged two years ago			2
the @entity3 has slipped to 50th in golf 's world rankings , having not won a tournament since the @entity19 masters in november 2009			1
but the 35 - year - old 's recent slump has not prevented @entity5 , the @entity22 champion , from selecting @entity7 as a wildcard pick for november 's @entity6 clash with the @entity25 in @entity19			1
" well i 've been asked that a lot , what would i do if i was in @entity5 's situation , " @entity1 , himself a former major champion , told a press conference at @entity31 and @entity32 in @entity33 , the venue for the @entity35			1
look out @entity10 : @entity3 golf is bouncing back " you certainly want one of the best players ever in the game , you want him on your team			2
i 'm hoping , for @entity7 's sake , that he has a full healthy season next year and we are not in this situation			0
that he 's back to his form and he 's ready to go			0
" i would love to play as @entity7 ' partner in a @entity6 or a @entity2			1
so i would probably have to go with exactly what @entity5 did			0
" @entity7 has played in six @entity50 since 1997 , but his only experience of team victory came at @entity53 , @entity54 in 1999 after missing out due to injury three years ago			2
he had planned to take the rest of this year off , but his @entity6 selection persuaded him to enter the @entity57 starting october 6 , when he will be partnered by new caddy @entity58 -- who carried @entity5 ' bag for more than 20 years			1
@entity58 left @entity5 this year when the 51 - year - old decided to reduce his playing schedule , and worked with 2010 @entity2 player @entity62 until the end of the @entity66 's recent @entity65 playoffs			1
" @entity58 is an outstanding caddy , " @entity7 told his official website on sunday			1
" i have known him for many years			0
i 've personally seen the great job he did for @entity69			0
i 'm anxious for us to be working together			0
" @entity58 added : " i 'm excited to be working with @entity7			2
i contacted @entity7 and @entity71 ( @entity72 , @entity7 ' agent ) because this is a unique opportunity to be part of something very special			0
" @entity7 and i have been friends for a very long time , and i know what he can do			0
