-- whose side are you on ? a : i do n't like hockey			1
( " i ca n't see the puck			1
" " too many fights			2
" " i do n't get the rules			1
" " i ca n't name a player except that @entity11 what 's - his - name			1
" ) or : b : i like hockey			2
( " a lot better in person than on tv			1
" " @entity16 's so slow			2
" " @entity18 's all guys 8 feet tall			2
" " i would n't watch soccer if you paid me			1
" ) me , i am @entity21 hockey and i are old friends			2
i grew up in @entity23 , right now the hottest town on ice			1
i also lived in @entity26 , the self - named " @entity27 , @entity28			2
" i now reside in @entity29 , current home of the game 's @entity30			1
( that 's the trophy that goes to the championship team , for those of you who would n't know a @entity30 from a sippy cup			1
) the @entity23 have been in the news			1
why ? well , that 's a good question			2
because they win a lot ? uh , kind of			2
because they do n't lose ? er , technically , no. i will try to explain it if you 've got a couple of minutes to kill			1
( which is also a hockey thing ... killing a couple of minutes while a guy 's in a penalty box			2
) @entity23 's record is 21 - 0			1
that 's how it looks in the @entity54 's standings , at least			2
@entity55 21 , l 0			2
are the @entity23 unbeaten ? um , no. @entity56 : top 25 all - time @entity23 it 's a little complicated			1
a hockey game no longer can end in a tie			2
it uses an overtime period to break a tie			2
if that does n't work , a " shootout " is held , similar to soccer 's			1
one - on - one vs. a goaltender until someone wins			2
as a reward for extending a game to overtime , a team is given a bonus point by the @entity54			2
so , even if you lose a game in extra time -- as the @entity23 have -- you did n't " lose			1
" already knew that ? hey , you obviously know your hockey ! ( @entity79 trivia question : a team in @entity81 is called the @entity82			0
true or false ? ) if you are into pucks , you might be aware that the @entity23 put together a pretty cool 30 - game streak over a span of two seasons without being defeated in three 20 - minute periods			1
the team is the talk of the town			0
on national tv 's sports news , the two smokin ' - hot teams have been basketball 's @entity97 ( beating almost everybody they play ) and hockey 's @entity23 ( kinda sorta technically not losing to anybody they play )			1
i suppose you have heard of @entity97 's basketball star			0
he grew up in @entity81 , where he never once wanted to grow up to be a @entity109			0
but he did tweet that the @entity23 are awesome			1
i do not know if you know who @entity23 's hockey stars are			1
one of them is @entity114 , which is pronounced " @entity116 , " not toes , not tweeze			0
he went to the @entity118 , as most great athletes do			0
( ok , maybe not " most			0
" ) another one is @entity121 , which is pronounced " @entity123 , " not hoss sa , not hah sa. he is from @entity127 , @entity128 , where everybody probably watches him on @entity0 with no clue who @entity108 is			0
a definite one is @entity134 , as in @entity135			0
he was born and raised in @entity136 , @entity137 , where a boy is so lucky because he can play ice hockey outdoors 10 to 11 months a year			0
@entity56 : why the 2013 @entity23 will go down as one of the best teams ever together with some sharp teammates , not the least of whom is @entity144 , these guys have got @entity23 rocking and rolling			1
from the time tenor @entity151 operatically belts out our national anthem ( or @entity154 's ) to the times they pump up the volume to " @entity157 " by the @entity158 to celebrate a @entity160 goal , a home game at the @entity148 is usually loud , usually @entity161 and usually bigger than @entity162 and @entity163 rolled into one			1
if i exaggerate , sue me			0
i checked with @entity165 to find out just how big things there are			0
@entity165 is the team 's executive vice president " we 've been very fortunate to experience unprecedented television ratings , " he told me wednesday			0
" merchandise sales have accelerated			0
the @entity54 announced that @entity114 ' jersey sales were the number one - selling jersey in the country for the month of february			0
we also just passed the 200 consecutive - game sellout mark			0
tickets have become some of the hottest regular season tickets in history			0
" if he exaggerates -- and i doubt it -- do n't sue me			1
i 'm enjoying this too much			0
you see , it was n't so long ago my boyhood favorites the @entity23 were skating on ( insert " thin ice " cliche here )			1
they looked as dead in the water as a cruise ship			0
a great organization had become disorganized			0
a popular team to watch had disappeared off the radar			0
a team born in 1926 had turned into the @entity197 ( on skates )			0
they had @entity202 's @entity201 , followed by @entity203 's @entity201 , followed by a 2003 @entity92 team that could have won the @entity205 and a 2005 @entity207 team that did			1
i moved back there in 2003			0
the bad @entity160 team of 2003 - 04 played in 74 games and won 20			1
@entity212 ranked it 119th of 120 franchises in all of sports , in terms of ownership , fan relations , players , coaching , intangibles such as " bang for your buck , " ahead of only the @entity225 , a new pro football team with zero dark history			0
home games were n't even shown on tv			1
on the nightly news , sportscasters gave time to highlights from games of the @entity233 , a minor - league team , almost as much as they did the @entity23			1
hey , if i liked minor - league hockey , i 'd live in @entity235			0
i seldom saw anybody in a @entity160 jersey go out in public anymore , except maybe @entity239 from " @entity240			0
" the 2004 - 05 season did n't happen			1
a union war broke out , and the @entity54 's whole season was wiped out			0
the @entity23 had n't won a @entity30 since 1961			1
that was their first since 1938			0
@entity56 : how will history view this team ? i was a hockey guy			0
i was n't just familiar with old - time hockey names such as @entity250			1
i knew @entity251 and @entity252 and " @entity253 and @entity254			0
i thought of them as other @entity23 sports fans might think of a @entity257 or an @entity258			1
so you can see , almost as exciting as winning 2010 's @entity30 was , why the 2013 superstart of the @entity23 is a sight to behold			1
@entity29 finally cracked the ice ceiling in 2012 with the @entity264 ' first championship , which was a pleasure to watch			0
i have a daughter who recently asked whether i could get her hockey tickets			0
she did n't want one direction or @entity269			2
she wanted @entity264 versus @entity270			0
@entity271 is n't for everybody			2
it 's just for us cool people			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity278 .			1

the @entity23 are on a winning streak
@entity278 : home games are " bigger than @entity162 and @entity163 rolled into one "
@entity278 remembers when local @entity23 tv *stations* did n't even carry @entity23 games
before 2010 , the @entity23 had n't won a @entity30 since 1961
