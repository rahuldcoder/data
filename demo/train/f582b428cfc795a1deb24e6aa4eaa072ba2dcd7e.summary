" the @entity214 lost contact with air traffic control early sunday shortly after the pilot requested permission to turn and climb to a higher altitude because of bad weather , according to @entity1 officials			0
authorities mounted a huge effort to find the aircraft , mapping out a search zone covering 156,000 square kilometers			1
questions remain about why @entity24 lost contact with air traffic control and what happened afterward			0
some experts have said the aircraft might have experienced an aerodynamic stall because of a lack of speed or from flying at too sharp an angle to get enough lift			0
analysts have also suggested the pilots might not have been getting information from onboard systems about the plane 's position or that rain or hail from thunderstorms in the area could have damaged the engines			1
the key to understanding what happened is likely to be contained in the aircraft 's flight recorders			2
