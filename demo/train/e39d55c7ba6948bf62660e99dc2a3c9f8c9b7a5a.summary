the @entity2 host broke @entity3 with her @entity2 - night group selfie using a mobile phone built by @entity6 , a major sponsor of @entity7 's big night			1
it generated a record 2.7 million retweets -- a coup for her , the @entity2 telecast and the @entity14 electronics maker			1
but some sharp - eyed observers noticed something a bit different when viewing the talk - show host 's backstage tweets			2
several of them , such as a photo of @entity23 with actor @entity24 , were sent not from a @entity26 handset but a rival iphone			0
the source of the photos and tweets ca n't be seen on @entity0 ' twitter page , but is visible when they 're viewed on another platform such as @entity34			1
@entity6 did not immediately respond to a request for comment from @entity37			2
several other photos @entity23 posted were sent using an @entity40 device , most likely the @entity6 phone she used to pose with @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and a handful of other a-list stars			1
a similar faux pas occurred in 2012 , when after weeks of talking up @entity51 's surface tablet , talk - show queen @entity48 sent a @entity3 message touting the product to her 14.8 million followers			0
however , @entity48 -- or whoever managed her @entity3 account -- sent the tweet from an @entity58			0
some bloggers came to her defense , noting that no official @entity3 app existed for the @entity63 's operating system at the time			0
and singer @entity65 claimed she was hacked after she was caught tweeting from an @entity66 last year while serving as a " creative director " for @entity68 .			0

@entity0 tweeted pics via phone from @entity2 sponsor @entity6
but backstage , @entity0 was also tweeting from an iphone
