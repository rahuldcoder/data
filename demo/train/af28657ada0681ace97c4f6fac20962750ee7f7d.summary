-- here 's a brief history lesson for you			0
three years ago , @entity3 was where you turned to look up a recipe			2
to chat with your friends when you were supposed to be working			0
but in the tech equivalent of a blink of the eye , things today are much different			0
throughout the last year , @entity3 has released a string of incredible hardware products , not just a bunch of virtual services you use through another company 's device			1
@entity3 really kicked it into gear in july 2012 with the @entity22 , its first - ever tablet , that was priced at just $ 199			1
it was n't just a great tablet because it was so cheap , it was simply a great tablet			0
even the @entity27 mini , which came out a few months later and sold for $ 130 more , was n't as good			0
then came another string of winners : the @entity31 smartphone , which you can buy unlocked and without a contract for just $ 299			0
the @entity34 , a beautiful laptop with a stunning high - resolution touchscreen			1
and more recently , the @entity37 , a dongle that plugs directly into your tv and lets you beam video from your @entity42 device , @entity41 or @entity27			1
there 's also the @entity44 , a new smartphone from @entity3 - owned @entity45 that 's one of the most accessible and easy to use @entity42 phones i 've ever tested			1
and do n't forget @entity48 , the promising , @entity49 - connected eyewear that should hit the market next year			1
as @entity51 keeps its head down and works on iterative ( but great ) updates to its @entity41 and @entity27 line , and as @entity54 struggles to find a way to make @entity57 devices like its surface tablet resonate with the public , @entity3 is releasing some of the most interesting and innovative hardware we 've seen recently			2
as a high - level executive at a very large tech company recently told me , no company can hope to be successful these days unless it can offer an ecosystem of software , services , and great devices to run them all on			2
yes , that 's the @entity51 model , but it 's a model that 's been proven to be a hit with consumers in the new mobile computing era			0
and @entity3 , a company that most people still associate with @entity78 and web searches , has been crushing it in both respects			1
it 's always done well with the data , apps , and services part of things , but stringing all that together with affordable , high - quality hardware is a new and exciting trend for the company			2
in some ways , @entity3 has done a better job at this than @entity51			2
for example , unlike the @entity92 , which requires you to have an @entity41 , @entity27 , or @entity94 to beam video , the new @entity37 will work with any major laptop , smartphone , or tablet no matter who makes it			2
and it does it all for a very reasonable $ 35 , or $ 64 less than @entity51 's product			0
there 's massive potential here for @entity3 to build tv - watching ecosystem built around the device			1
@entity51 may make great hardware , but it 's biggest challenge is still making reliable software and services			0
( remember the @entity113 debacle from last year ? ) meanwhile , @entity3 is already a pro at such services , and it 's packaging them along with great devices that are affordable and appeal to average users , not just the tech elite			1
to endure in the cutthroat tech world , a company ca n't just rely on doing one thing well			1
it has to push forward , experiment , and get messy			0
in the last year , @entity3 has proved it can do all that -- and make some quality gadgets at the same time			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity128			0
