-- the death toll from the destructive typhoon that savaged the southern @entity4 last week has climbed above 700 , authorities said tuesday , warning that the final number may be much higher			1
nearly 900 people are still unaccounted for in the aftermath of @entity8 , the strongest and deadliest storm to hit the @entity4 this year , according to the country 's emergency management agency			1
the numbers of dead and missing have risen drastically during the past several days as government officials have gathered information from isolated areas where the scale of the devastation was previously unknown			1
both of the grim totals are likely to increase further this week , said @entity21 , head of the @entity22 , the emergency agency			0
@entity24 efforts are continuing , he said , despite the declining chances of finding people alive			1
" we are still hoping against hope that there are still survivors , " he said by telephone , adding that some of the hundreds of fishermen reported missing after the storm could yet be found sheltering on small islands out at sea			1
if only a few of those missing are found alive , @entity8 could eventually prove more deadly than @entity38 , which killed 1,268 people a year ago			1
but its toll would still remain far below that of @entity43 , the country 's most lethal storm on record that left more than 5,000 people dead in 1991			1
the worst of the death and destruction from @entity50 took place on the southern island of @entity53 , where the storm hit first and hardest with gusts as strong as 220 kph ( 138 mph )			2
in the provinces of @entity57 and @entity58 , the heavy rain set off flash floods and landslides that engulfed whole neighborhoods , and the winds ripped apart fragile houses			0
many residents were unprepared or unaware of the typhoon 's threat to the region , which rarely experiences tropical cyclones of such magnitude			0
@entity8 , known locally as @entity71 , was the most powerful typhoon to hit @entity53 in decades			1
@entity57 and @entity58 account for the vast majority of the 714 people killed and for most of the 890 still missing nationwide			1
a week after the typhoon struck , survivors there are facing many obstacles to rebuilding their lives			2
hundreds of thousands of people are living in evacuation centers or relying on the government for other kinds of assistance , according to the national emergency agency			1
and hundreds more , who have not been able to find refuge in the centers , line the roads of @entity57 , said @entity91 , a relief worker in the region for @entity93 , a humanitarian group			2
" during the daytime , they stand along the side of the road , they ask for food , " he said			0
at night , they sleep in small , makeshift shelters cobbled together out of bits of wood and canvas scavenged from the debris , he added			0
in @entity107 , the town at the heart of the devastation , dead bodies are still being found and lined up in an open space in front of an evacuation center , according to @entity91			2
when aid workers or government officials arrive in the town , he said , residents crowd around them , hoping to get the food or water they desperately need , he said			0
the region 's prospects for longer term recovery are also bleak , since the storm laid waste to a great deal of the agricultural land on which many residents rely for their livelihood			0
" farming communities have been the worst hit and it could take many years for them to fully recover , " said @entity127 , the humanitarian program coordinator for the charity @entity128			0
the @entity132 has announced a global appeal to try to raise $ 65 million to help those affected by the storm			2
and @entity4 president @entity136 , who visited @entity107 and other severely affected areas last week , has declared a state of national calamity , which releases emergency funds and puts price controls on basic goods			1
finger pointing has also begun among officials over the reasons why so many people lost their lives			2
local authorities have been criticized for not anticipating the scale of the destruction			0
and a member of @entity136 's government , environment secretary @entity153 , has said illegal logging and mining contributed to the landslides and flash floods on @entity53			0
@entity158 has implemented measures aimed at clamping down on logging in @entity4 forests			1
" several quarters are criticizing the declaration of a total log ban but look at what happened , " he said last week , referring to the devastation on @entity53 , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity163			0
" it is now proving that we really must stop timber harvesting , especially in our natural forests			0
