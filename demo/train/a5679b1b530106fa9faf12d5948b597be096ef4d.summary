outgoing @entity1 gov. @entity0 is leaving office with a personal problem that has gone national : his decision to pardon his own son			1
@entity6 was charged in 2003 with possession of a controlled substance ( marijuana ) and served three years probation and paid a fine			1
critics have said the decision is proof that @entity0 is abusing his power as he leaves the governor 's mansion			1
the accusation , @entity0 said , hurts him			1
" am i disappointed , of course			0
does it hurt , sure			0
would i have a tendencies to lash out , yes , i am human , " said the two - term governor , a @entity20			2
" but i acknowledge and accept that this is part of life and people will say what people will say			0
" the issue , @entity0 made clear during an interview in his @entity30 office on friday , is more than just a political one for him			1
" on a personal note , i am embarrassed , " @entity0 said at his @entity30 office on friday			1
" and have been since 2003 when he got in trouble			2
the main thing is , he is embarrassed			0
" the @entity36 recommended @entity6 's pardon last month			1
it came after the now 34 - year - old wrote a lengthy letter in his pardon application that for " a second chance at life			2
" while some see the issue as an abuse of power , @entity0 sees the issue more about fairness			1
according to his office , the governor has granted 717 pardons , most of which have been for young people with drug convictions			0
" this one is being scrutinized for obvious reasons , " @entity0 said			1
" but if i grant him the pardon , and i intend to when it ever reaches me desk , he will be treated just like everybody else in the same situation			1
" he added , " i understand the scrutiny but it is not like he is inconsistent with what my policy has been for eight years			0
" it was clear , too , that @entity0 feels slight guilt for the fact that his son 's drug trouble has become a national news story			1
" he is under a bigger microscope than others similarly situated			0
through no fault of his own , he just happened to be my son , " @entity0 said			1
" he is under a bigger microscope and it is my fault , not his fault			0
if i was n't governor , he would n't be under a bigger microscope			0
" @entity0 , though , will be leaving that microscopic scrutiny in months			2
he is term - limited and his choice to succeed him , @entity89 , lost his race for governor to @entity93 @entity92			0
@entity0 swore on friday that his time in politics is over , and despite this being one of the last aspects of his legacy , it does not leave him feeling burned			2
" when you are in this seat , when you are in this office , the awareness is heightened , everything you do is heightened , everything that affects you is heightened , " @entity0 said			2
" but that is part of it			0
that is the risk you take			0
you hate it for your family because your family gets pulled into it			0
