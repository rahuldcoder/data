-- an 87th minute header from beleaguered striker @entity2 handed @entity3 a 2 - 1 victory over @entity5 rivals @entity6 in the semifinal of the @entity8 on saturday			1
@entity2 's effort compounded a miserable second half for @entity12 ' team after a promising opening to the match played at @entity15			1
@entity16 pounced on a mix up between @entity3 defender 's @entity18 and @entity20 in the 24th minute to side - foot past goalkeeper @entity21 to hand @entity6 the lead			1
it stayed that way until the 62nd minute when @entity26 's sloppy back - pass gifted @entity3 a way back into the game			2
@entity28 raced onto the mistake before comfortably beating @entity30 with the outside of his right boot to level the scores			0
@entity3 perhaps should have been ahead earlier in the half when @entity2 missed a gilt - edged chance to equalize but somehow directed his header wide			1
but the $ 55 million man made amends rising above @entity6 's @entity39 to nod home the winner from a @entity43 free - kick			1
" it 's the best feeling ever			0
we worked hard and getting the goal right there at the end was great , " @entity2 told @entity45 afterwards			2
" i had a few chances and should have probably scored earlier			0
but i kept at it and it was a great ball in by @entity43 ( @entity53 ) , and i just had to score with that one and i did			0
" it 's a great feeling			0
i 've had some criticism but i 've just kept on going , " @entity2 added			2
his manager @entity57 , who has also been the subject of criticism after @entity3 's poor league form in recent weeks , was delighted with the effort of his team			2
" i think it was fantastic and although it 's not been too good in the league recently , that 's two cup finals -- one we 've won and won we 're looking forward to , " @entity57 told @entity45			0
@entity8 gives @entity57 opportunity to repay owners ' faith @entity70 take on @entity71 in the second semifinal on sunday			1

meanwhile in the @entity75 , @entity74 scored a hat - trick for @entity77 on saturday in the @entity75 as @entity77 thrashed @entity78 6 - 1 at @entity79			1
the win closes the gap on leaders @entity83 to just two points who play @entity86 at @entity87 on sunday			1
the @entity88 put @entity77 ahead in the 18th minute , before his compatriot @entity89 added a second nine minutes later			2
@entity93 's goal for @entity78 six minutes after the break gave home fans hope of a comeback but four goals from @entity77 in the final quarter of the match killed off the game			1
@entity74 bagged his second in the 73rd minute as did @entity89 two minutes later to make the game safe			0
@entity74 , who was starting only his second league game since last september , claimed his hat - trick ten minutes from the end , with @entity106 completing the rout in injury time to boost @entity77 's goal difference to plus 58 , eight ahead of @entity83			1
in the other three @entity75 fixtures played saturday , the teams struggling at the foot of the table all had days to forget			0
@entity114 played out a goalless draw against @entity116 at the @entity117 -- a result that does little to alleviate their plight at the bottom of the league			0
second - from - bottom @entity123 were beaten 3 - 0 by @entity124 , while 16th - placed @entity125 went down 1 - 0 against @entity126 at the @entity127 .			0
