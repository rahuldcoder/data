" the diplomats identified dozens of places on every continent , including mines , manufacturing complexes , ports and research establishments			0
@entity0 is not publishing specific details from the list , which refers to pipelines and undersea telecommunications cables as well as the location of minerals or chemicals critical to @entity3 industry			1
the list also mentions dams close to the @entity3 border and a telecommunications hub whose destruction might seriously disrupt global communications			2

" there are strong and valid reasons for classifying vital information , including the identification of critical infrastructure that is important to not only our society and economy , but those of other countries , " @entity9 said monday			0

@entity1 , which facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information , published the list of sensitive sites as part of a larger disclosure of what it says are 250,000 @entity10 documents that were never meant for public view			1
