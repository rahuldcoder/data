@entity0 , @entity1 -- meet @entity4 ceo @entity3 , who runs a software company based here in @entity7 that has been on a hot streak			1
last month , the company launched an @entity11 application , called @entity12 , that lets users keep track of favorite recipes and restaurants			2
it was an instant hit			0
@entity4 also released an @entity19 app , called @entity20 , for drawing and annotating on images			1
it has skyrocketed from 200,000 to 5 million users since @entity4 acquired the startup behind the technology in august			1
all of @entity4 's apps tie into its online note - taking and file - storage service			1
it has 21 million users , of which nearly a million pay for access to more storage space and capabilities , @entity3 said			0
the company 's major growth left executives scurrying for a place to fit all of its new employees			1
they will move into a much larger headquarters in nearby @entity43 , @entity1 , in the next few months , @entity3 said			0
" we want to be the @entity45 of getting stuff done , " @entity3 told @entity2 , referring to the maker of such hit social - network games as " @entity49 " and " @entity50			2
" " i think that 's really what we 're becoming			2
" despite the successes , @entity4 's most ambitious recent project has n't immediately taken off			1
@entity55 , a quirky @entity11 app for exchanging contact information that launched at the same time as the @entity12 app , has not gotten off to a terrific start			2
it 's billed as a replacement for business cards and address books , asking users to hand their phones over to strangers who then input their e-mail addresses and phone numbers and snap head shots to help them pair a face with the name			1
@entity72 , the @entity74 - owned technology website , covered it under the headline , " @entity55 shares cooties and contacts			2
" another tech blog , @entity80 , called it " an app only @entity83 would love , " a reference to the fictional nerd from the @entity74 show " @entity81			2
" @entity3 , who does bear some resemblance to the tv character played by actor @entity88 , said @entity4 is making changes in response to user feedback			1
for example , the app should allow users to snap a picture of a business card using the @entity11 's camera and automatically input the information from it -- like @entity101 's @entity100 , @entity3 said			1
it may also let two people who have the app running exchange contact info wirelessly in a process similar to the @entity107 app , he said			2
users will also have the option of inputting the data themselves manually , rather than handing the phone over to a new acquaintance , @entity3 said			0
however , he defended his original concept , saying that people take better pictures of themselves when they are controlling the camera			0
" your photo booth instincts kick in , " @entity3 said			0
" you just get better photos			0
" during an interview at @entity4 's headquarters last week , i handed @entity3 my phone and asked him to input his contact information into the @entity55 app. he winced and observed that the app has already advanced so far beyond the publicly available version i was using that it was barely recognizable to him			1
@entity3 describes the alphabetical organization of most contact lists as outdated , a remnant from when people 's names and numbers were printed on linear pages			2
perhaps the last mainstream innovation in address books came in 2007 when @entity142 introduced a favorites list to the @entity11			1
@entity55 shows contacts in a mosaic of people 's faces			0
" your brain does n't remember things alphabetically , " @entity3 said			0
a new version of @entity55 will be available in the next few weeks , @entity3 said			0
it should bring the product closer to @entity3 's original concept of supplanting the address book by giving it a 21st - century update and merging it with your calendar			1
" it 's sort of as if your address book , your calendar and your camera had a love child , " @entity3 said			1
part of the inspiration for @entity55 came from @entity3 's own inability to remember people by name , he said			0
still , the app has a long way to go			0
as @entity3 tweaks his pet project , @entity4 developers are working on at least two more apps to be released this year			1
one is for keeping a to - do list , and another is for organizing travel tips , @entity3 said			0
" @entity55 is really ambitious , and it 's going to take us a long time to get it right , " @entity3 said			0
" but it 's the one i think has the most potential to change things			0
