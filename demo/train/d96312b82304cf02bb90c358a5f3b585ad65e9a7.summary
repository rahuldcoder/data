@entity0 8003 , @entity1 -- to be at the front line of a " cold war " is , these days , a rare thing -- particularly when that front line is a remote chain of islands in the @entity1 , hundreds of kilometers from the nearest landfall			1
the waters around the @entity12 , a largely unpopulated archipelago administered by @entity13 but claimed by @entity14 , have become the " battleground " in an increasingly volatile territorial dispute between the two communist neighbors			1
taking advantage of a rare opportunity to witness the spat up close , @entity2 traveled to the area with the @entity14 @entity0			1
tensions between @entity23 and @entity24 ratcheted up last month , when a @entity13 state - owned company deployed an oil rig in waters off the @entity12			1
it was set up unilaterally , without any discussion between the two sides , much to the annoyance of the @entity14 who view it as a @entity13 incursion into their sovereign waters			1
since then , an increasing number of @entity13 and @entity14 ships -- both government and private fishing boats -- have crossed paths in the area with occasionally serious consequences -- not least reports of @entity13 vessels using water cannon and ramming fishing boats straying too close to the oil platform			1
entering the fray our trip out to this marine flashpoint did n't start well			0
after days of prevarication over our departure date from the @entity14 port of @entity57 , an official told us -- the small contingent of foreign correspondents selected for this rare press trip -- that while at sea we would confined below decks			2
" we do n't want the @entity13 to know we have journalists on board , " he explained			2
as expressions ranged from the defeated to the incredulous , this new piece of information was hastily qualified			0
" do n't worry , there are plenty of windows that you can film through			0
" we eventually did set off , hustled out to sea as the light faded over @entity57 , two and a half days later than planned			0
crammed into a small supply boat heading out to the @entity12 , about 160 nautical miles ( 296 kilometers ) from @entity14 's central coast , it was n't long before the boat fell quiet and the 40 journalists -- both local and international -- took to their bunks			1
the crew , despite their casual , day - to - day appearance -- they only wear uniforms for official duties and , it turns out , camera appearances -- were serious , and resolute in their roles -- the first line of defense against what they see as @entity13 aggression			2
toeing the party line the @entity14 refrain about these territorial waters is constant and unerring			2
crew members explained to me that @entity13 is breaking the 1982 @entity98 , and that the vessels are engaged in illegal activities in waters that are part of @entity14 's continental shelf			1
once away from @entity14 's coast , we transferred to a bigger ship , @entity0 8003 , one of the service 's most prominent vessels , and armed with 25 mm and 14.5 mm cannon -- although i was told that they did not bring live ammunition on these patrols			1
fears of being locked in below the waterline quickly faded as we were permitted on deck			0
it is lonely out on the water , a vast expanse stretching hundreds of miles in each direction , and around a thousand meters beneath our hull			0
topside , a lone seagull followed the ship as it began its regular patrol up and down a line adjacent to the oil rig , which eventually loomed large on the horizon			0
the oil rig -- identified as hd - 981 -- is omnipresent			0
it 's there in everyone 's minds , it 's the focus of much of the conversation on the boat , and it 's physically visible for most of our time at sea -- though we keep our distance			0
despite our considerable distance from land , the horizon bristles with the silhouettes of dozens of ships , a mixture of @entity14 and @entity147 vessels and fishing fleets from both sides			2
the @entity14 fishing boats are draped in red banners , which urge the @entity13 to leave their territory			1
dangerous dance for the most part , ships circle , warily keeping their distance , and posture at each other from afar			0
however , things can , and do , spill over			0
hours before we arrive in the area , a @entity14 fishing boat has been capsized , purportedly rammed by a @entity13 vessel			1
while the @entity13 insist the @entity14 side was at fault , the captain of the sunk vessel told me days later that he was sure the boat that hit them was a @entity147 vessel disguised as a fishing boat -- such is the level of suspicion and mistrust in this hotly - disputed body of water			1
in charge of @entity180 , one of the service 's largest and most prominent vessels , captain @entity178 has around 50 men under his protection and a very visible role to play in this conflict with @entity13			1
he says that there is no communication between his ship -- or any other @entity14 vessel -- and the @entity13 ; no open radio channel , no way to prevent events from escalating dangerously			1
our @entity14 hosts insist they are determined to resolve the matter peacefully and in full accordance with international law , but beyond the recorded warnings blasting out of loudspeakers into the heavy , humid sea air , it is not certain what their presence hopes to achieve			2
@entity13 attacks @entity13 's response is a little more robust , it would seem			2
video taken by a @entity2 affiliate , among others , shows @entity13 vessels attacking @entity14 ships in the disputed area with water cannon and also ramming them			1
a @entity216 ( @entity216 ) crew embedded with @entity2 aboard @entity180 says the previous vessel they were aboard , a government fisheries surveillance ship , was itself rammed by the @entity147			0
for its part , @entity13 abides by its territorial claims and blames the @entity14 side for ratcheting tensions			1
" the drilling activities of this rig are within @entity13 's territorial waters			2
the harassment by the @entity14 side is in violation of @entity13 's sovereign rights , " said @entity228 , spokesperson of @entity13 's @entity229			1
for the media contingent , there is no direct experience of @entity13 aggression as we sail up and down a furrow of the @entity1 , though from time to time we discover a @entity147 vessel stalking us , gleaming white in the unceasing sun , but they never come closer than a couple of hundred meters			2
we are , however , woken early one morning to see what the captain said was a @entity13 coast guard vessel using water cannon on a @entity14 fisheries surveillance vessel			1
at distance , the arc of the water looks graceful , but up close it is a vicious jet which can break windows , disrupt engines and cause electrical failure and even fires			0
@entity257 - rattling while @entity13 ships keep their distance , they are intent on making their presence known			0
when the ships are close enough , we can see the deck - mounted guns have had their tarpaulins removed -- a less than subtle signal perhaps			0
in any event , the sight of naked weaponry only dozens of meters away is unsettling			0
the @entity13 presence is also felt in the air			0
towards the end of our embed aboard the ship , we see a surveillance plane -- which journalists aboard the coast guard vessel are assured is @entity13 -- leisurely bank around our vessel time and time again , sometimes flying low and close enough for those on board to make out its markings with the naked eye			1
while there is no immediate threat from the aircraft , its intelligence - gathering is enough to make those on board jumpy			0
for now , though , tensions remain largely under wraps			0
but for as long as both sides maintain their equally intransigent positions , shrilly trading blame and engaging in low - level incidents of maritime thuggery , signs of this feud diminishing , and ending up as a footnote in the history books , remain distant .			0

@entity13 and @entity14 at odds over a chain of largely *uninhabited* islands in the @entity1
recent oil drilling operations by @entity13 near the @entity12 , which they administer , have irked @entity24
@entity2 traveled with @entity14 coast guard to see how this conflict has become so volatile
@entity14 says @entity13 vessels are being *highly* aggressive , often using water cannon
