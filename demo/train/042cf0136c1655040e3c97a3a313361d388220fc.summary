-- scientifically , can happiness be an advantage ? some people think if you are happy , you are blind to reality			1
but when we research it , happiness actually raises every single business and educational outcome for the brain			1
how did we miss this ? why do we have these societal misconceptions about happiness ? because we assumed you were average			2
when we study people , scientists are often interested in what the average is			2
if we study what is merely average , we will remain merely average			0
many people think happiness is genetic			0
that 's only half the story , because the average person does not fight their genes			0
when we stop studying the average and begin researching positive outliers -- people who are above average for a positive dimension like optimism or intelligence -- a wildly different picture emerges			1
our daily decisions and habits have a huge impact upon both our levels of happiness and success			0
watch @entity43 's @entity42 video to hear about this research scientifically , happiness is a choice			1
it is a choice about where your single processor brain will devote its finite resources as you process the world			1
if you scan for the negative first , your brain literally has no resources left over to see the things you are grateful for or the meaning embedded in your work			1
but if you scan the world for the positive , you start to reap an amazing advantage			1
see also : when losing your job is a positive now that there is research validity to these claims , the working world is starting to take notice			1
in january , i wrote the cover story for the @entity67 on " @entity68 to @entity69			0
" based on my article called " @entity71 " and my research in @entity73 , i outlined our researched conclusion : the single greatest advantage in the modern economy is a happy and engaged workforce			1
a decade of research in the business world proves that happiness raises nearly every business and educational outcome : raising sales by 37 % , productivity by 31 % , and accuracy on tasks by 19 % , as well as a myriad of health and quality - of - life improvements			1
given the unprecedented level of unhappiness at companies and the direct link between happiness and business outcomes , the question is not whether happiness should matter to companies			0
given this research , it clearly should			0
the first question is : what can i do in my own life to reap the advantage of happiness ? see also : ambition could make you rich , but not happy training your brain to be positive at work is just like training your muscles at the gym			1
sounds simple , right ? well , think about how easy it is to make yourself go to the gym			0
the key with any new resolution is to make it a habit			0
new research on neuroplasticity -- the ability of the brain to change even as an adult -- reveals that moderate actions can rewire the brain as you create " life habits			2
" in @entity73 , i challenge readers to do one brief positive exercise every day for 21 days			2
only through behavioral change can information become transformation			0
write down three new things you are grateful for each day ; write for two minutes a day describing one positive experience you had over the past 24 hours ; exercise for 10 minutes a day ; meditate for two minutes , focusing on your breath going in and out ; write one quick email first thing in the morning thanking or praising someone in your social support network ( family member , friend , old teacher )			2
but does it work ? in the midst of the worst tax season in history i did a three - hour intervention at auditing and tax accounting firm @entity155 , describing how to reap the happiness advantage by creating one of these positive habits			1
four months later , there was a 24 % improvement in job and life satisfaction			0
not only is change possible , this is one of the first long - term roi ( return on investment ) studies proving that happiness leads to long - term quantifiable positive change			2
in a study i performed on 1,600 @entity67 students in 2007 , i found that there was a 0.7 correlation between perceived social support and happiness			0
this is higher than the connection between smoking and cancer			0
so if in the modern world we give up our social networks to work away from friends and follow celebrities on @entity184 , we are trading off with our happiness and health			1
following up , i switched around the questions and asked how much social support employees provided ( instead of received )			0
the results were off the charts			0
those high on provision of social support are 10 times more engaged at work and have a 40 % higher likelihood of promotion over the next four years			2
in other words , giving at the office gets you more than receiving			0
the greatest cultural myth in modern society is that we can not change			2
my research proves that you can not only become more positive , but if you prioritize happiness in the present , you can reap an extraordinary advantage			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity43 .			1

the greatest advantage in the economy is a happy workforce , *argues* @entity43
@entity43 says if you scan the world for the positive , you start to reap an advantage
he *explains* how to train your brain to be positive at work
