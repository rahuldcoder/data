@entity0 , @entity1 -- the underwater hunt for wreckage of @entity5 has started in the southern @entity6 , the @entity1 agency coordinating search efforts said friday			1
but the area where two naval ships are deploying sophisticated technology remains nothing more than an educated guess at where the plane may have hit the water			1
the @entity18 survey ship @entity19 and the @entity1 naval supply ship @entity20 are searching along a single 240 - kilometer ( 150 - mile ) track , said retired air chief marshal @entity22 , the head of @entity1 's @entity23			1
the @entity20 is equipped with the @entity24 , a giant underwater microphone that will listen for the pings from the flight recorders and the @entity28 - 21 , an underwater robot that can scour the ocean bed , looking for signs of wreckage			1
time is running out in the efforts to detect the pings , as the batteries that power the recorders ' beacons are expected to run out in the coming days			0
and there are no big , new clues behind the area where the underwater search is concentrated			1
it 's based on the same kind of analysis of radar , satellite and other data that investigators have used to determine a series of shifting search areas in recent weeks			1
" the area of highest probability as to where the aircraft might have entered the water is the area where the underwater search will commence , " @entity22 said at a news conference friday			1
" it 's on the basis of data that arrived only recently , and it 's the best data that is available			1
" ' just a guess ' until searchers can find a confirmed piece of debris from the plane , which would give them a clearer idea of where the main wreckage might be located , there is no certainty the technology is being pointed in the right direction			1
" really the best we can do right now is put these assets in the best location -- the best guess we have -- and kind of let them go , " @entity74			0
" until we get conclusive evidence of debris , it is just a guess			0
" a huge search is also continuing above the waves			1
friday 's area of focus covers about 217,000 square kilometers ( 83,800 square miles ) of the @entity6 , 1,700 kilometers ( 1,050 miles ) northwest of the western @entity1 city of @entity0 , authorities said			1
a total of 14 aircraft and nine ships will scan the area over the course of the day			1
officials have warned of a potentially prolonged hunt for the missing passenger jet , which vanished nearly four weeks ago with 239 people on board			0
long days spent combing vast tracts of ocean have so far turned up no traces			0
' we can not be certain of success ' @entity1 prime minister @entity107 on thursday described the search as " the most difficult in human history " and warned there was no guarantee the missing plane would be found			1
" we can not be certain of ultimate success in the search for @entity5 , " he said at a news briefing in @entity0 , the western city that is serving as the hub for search operations			1
" but we can be certain that we will spare no effort -- that we will not rest -- until we have done everything we humanly can			0
" @entity107 was speaking during a visit to @entity0 by @entity122 prime minister @entity121 , who met with members of the search teams who have been scouring a remote part of the southern @entity6 for traces of the jetliner			1
" they told me of the difficulties of a search like this , of distance and weather and of maintaining morale over a long period , " @entity121 said			2
his visit came on the 27th day of the hunt for the passenger jet , which disappeared march 8 over @entity140			0
investigators are yet to provide an explanation of why the plane flew way off course or pinpoint exactly where it ended up			2
officials say that an analysis of the available data suggests the jet 's journey finished in the southern @entity6			2
6 missteps in the investigation ' till hell freezes over ' weeks of combing vast areas of ocean have turned up plenty of floating junk , like old bits of fishing gear , but so far no sign of the plane			2
authorities say they will persevere despite the challenges			0
" we 'll keep going till hell freezes over , " @entity164 , @entity1 's former defense minister and current ambassador to the @entity166 , told @entity2 's @entity167			1
" it could take months , it could take years			0
" @entity122 officials held a briefing for @entity122 relatives of those aboard mh370 thursday evening at a @entity174 hotel , but those present told @entity2 nothing new had emerged			0
@entity176 , whose cousin @entity177 was a honeymooning groom on the plane , said the three - hour session had felt like a " waste of time			2
" he added , " i was hoping for some news that they had tracked the plane or some parts of it , but nothing like that happened			2
" @entity188 , the father of another passenger , @entity122 civil flight engineer @entity190 , said officials explained in detail the satellite data that has led investigators to the search area in the southern @entity6			1
but , he said , " they could not tell us if the plane crashed			2
they said they were still looking into it			0
" @entity20 : a mission of hope in search for @entity5 @entity204 investigation continues with the hunt at sea so far proving fruitless , there are no signs of a breakthrough in the investigation into those on board the plane			1
all 227 passengers have been cleared of any role in hijacking or sabotage or having psychological or personal issues that might have played a role in the plane 's disappearance , the inspector general of @entity122 police , @entity224 , told reporters wednesday			1
police said a review of a flight simulator found in a pilot 's house proved inconclusive			2
and senior @entity122 government officials told @entity2 last week that authorities have found nothing about either of the two pilots to suggest a motive			0
there have been no such public comments about the other 10 crew members , however			0
investigators are still questioning relatives of all of those on the plane -- having already interviewed about 170 people -- as well as those who may have had access to it			2
that includes scrutinizing those who prepared food for the flight , those who packed the cargo , and those who were to receive the cargo in @entity251			0
" everything from beginning to end , " said @entity224 , stressing that getting answers wo n't be easy or quick			0
" we have to clear every little thing , " he said			0
" you can not hurry us in whatever we are doing			0
" his comments were echoed by @entity260 , who spoke to @entity2 's @entity261 from @entity262			2
his wife , @entity263 , was on the flight			0
" this is an event that is so unprecedented and i think that is so significant that it can never be allowed to get off the screens , get off the radar , " he said			0
" my concern is that if we do n't really get to the bottom of it , we can not really be certain that we are safe and that we are secure every time we board a flight			0
" flight 370 : high - tech search tools inside the flight simulator read the cockpit transcript @entity2 's @entity280 reported from @entity0 , @entity281 reported and wrote from @entity282 , and @entity283 wrote in @entity284			1
@entity2 's @entity285 , @entity286 , @entity287 , @entity288 and @entity289 , and journalist @entity290 contributed to this report .			0
