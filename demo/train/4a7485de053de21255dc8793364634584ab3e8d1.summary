-- @entity2 has been sending the family of @entity4 , the girlfriend he fatally shot last year , a monthly payment since march 2013 , a probation officer told his sentencing hearing in @entity7 on tuesday			1
probation officer and social worker @entity9 told the court that @entity2 ' legal team had told her about the payments , of 6,000 rand ( about $ 540 ) a month , and she suggested that this showed remorse			1
she said @entity2 had offered the family more besides the monthly payments			1
the athlete sold his car for about $ 35,000 and had that money given to the @entity4 family , she said			1
@entity2 ' manager , @entity20 , facilitated the monthly payments from @entity2 ' bank account			1
however , the @entity4 family has rejected the money , the court heard			1
prosecutor @entity23 said that @entity4 's mother , @entity24 , had said she did n't want " blood money			1
" he told the court that @entity4 's parents had said they would repay the monthly payments in full			1
the @entity4 family , through a lawyer , told @entity9 that it was " neutral " on the sentencing phase of the trial , @entity9 said			1
she told the court that neither of @entity4 's parents would testify for the state at the hearing			1
@entity2 ' vulnerable ' in prison judge @entity39 , who presided over @entity2 ' high - profile trial and delivered the verdict last month , will decide his sentence , which may or may not see him spend time behind bars			1
the hearing , which began monday , is likely to take several days , as the prosecution and defense put their arguments before the court			2
@entity9 argued that @entity2 should not be sent to prison , saying that as a double amputee , he would be vulnerable to gang rape -- particularly if his prosthetic legs were taken away			2
@entity54 suggested that if @entity2 were allowed to keep his prosthetic legs while in prison , he 'd be fine			2
but @entity9 said that even if the court allowed @entity2 to keep the legs , there was no guarantee the order would be complied with			2
@entity2 was found guilty of culpable homicide , the @entity7 term for unintentionally , but unlawfully , killing a person			2
however , the judge cleared him of murder in @entity4 's death and granted him bail pending the sentencing hearing			1
' broken man ' on monday , a psychologist said @entity2 was a " broken man " after the death of his girlfriend , as his defense tried to convince a judge of his fragile emotional state			0
dr. @entity75 said the @entity76 described @entity4 as the love of his life			0
he lost faith in himself and his abilities after the killing , she said			0
but the prosecution dismissed her findings			0
" we 're dealing with a broken man , but he 's still alive , " @entity54 said in an apparent reference to the fact that @entity4 is not			2
" he has lost his love relationship ... but he will be able to love somebody else like that			0
" sentence hard to predict there is no legal minimum sentence for culpable homicide in @entity7 law , so it will be up to the judge to decide			0
a typical sentence is five to eight years			0
but it is a principle of @entity7 law that the sentence should be tailored to the culprit as a whole person , as opposed to the crime			0
that makes predicting a sentence difficult , said @entity105 , a @entity0 legal analyst			0
the judge also found @entity2 guilty of one weapons - related charge involving a shooting at a restaurant			0
the maximum penalty for that is five years behind bars			0
but he could get a lesser sentence , such as a fine or the loss of his gun license			0
