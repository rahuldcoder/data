-- it 's a surfer 's paradise -- but @entity3 is out on her own when it comes to professional women 's wave - riding in @entity7			1
unlike many @entity9 girls , she 's right at home on the beach			2
" i think my soul is already in the water			2
the ocean just calls me , ' come , come , come			2
' when i go to the beach , i feel like it 's my home , " she tells @entity0 's human to @entity17			2
the 20 - year - old is @entity7 's only native female pro surfer			1
the @entity9 island is a mecca for wave - seekers and beach - loving tourists , but of the locals it 's mainly men who mix it up with the visitors			1
" a lot of my friends say , ' why do you like surfing ? surfing is dangerous			2
' it 's not dangerous for me			2
it 's very fun , " @entity3 says			1
" @entity9 girls are scared of getting dark skin and do n't want to go surfing			0
and i 'm the luckiest one , i love the beach			0
" born in @entity40 , a coastal town in southern @entity7 that has been absorbed by the major tourist resort of @entity42 , @entity3 has lived by the sea all her life			1
" so many @entity47 come and act like bad tourists and make everything dirty , " she told @entity46 website last month			0
" but no matter what i would never leave @entity7 , because i can surf amazing waves all - year - round and you ca n't do that anywhere else			1
" her dad was a renowned local surfer , but he was n't so keen when she said she wanted to follow in his footsteps			1
so the 12 - year - old went behind his back and learned from her uncle instead			1
two years later , she made a name for herself at a local talent contest and earned a sponsorship deal			0
the middle of three sisters , @entity3 says surfing has given her an identity			1
unlike her father , who had to give up the sport to support the family , she has been able to combine competing with her university studies thanks to funding from @entity73 -- one of surfing 's major brands			1
" i feel so lucky			0
no - one from @entity7 can surf			1
i do n't want to be like any other girls , " she says			0
" i feel great because i can do something different			0
everything in my life now is about surfing			0
" @entity3 's major breakthrough came when she won a bronze medal for @entity9 at the @entity82 , which were held in @entity7			1
" i met the president , had an interview with him and we talked a lot , " she recalls			0
" it was really cool			0
and my mom and my dad were proud of me , and my name was in every newspaper			0
" the silver medal winner that year was @entity93			1
from the island of @entity95 , off the coast of @entity97 , she has gone on to become the most successful female @entity9 surfer			1
@entity3 competes against @entity93 on the @entity99 , but says her biggest inspiration comes from women riding on the world stage -- such as leading @entity47 @entity103 and @entity104 , and @entity106 's @entity105			1
joining them is still a pipe dream ; she acknowledges she has yet to pay her dues on the @entity111 circuit			2
" i want to win this tour			0
i want to focus on that -- it 's my dream , " @entity3 says			1
" i 'm not going to @entity115 yet , but i will			0
and i want to go to @entity47 , maybe next year			2
" but wherever she ends up , there 's no place like home -- where already she 's inspiring young girls to take up surfing			0
" it feels so amazing , because now young girls are surfing and then taking pictures with a hashtag , and then just following me , " she says			0
" it 's really good to get more girls surfing in @entity9			0
i 'm just trying to keep encouraging everyone to get in the water and enjoy life			0

@entity3 is the only female @entity129 surfer on the pro circuit
the 20 - year - old hopes to inspire more from her island to compete
her father was a surfer but had to give up to support the family
