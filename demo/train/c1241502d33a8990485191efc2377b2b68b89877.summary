editor 's note : @entity3 contributor @entity2 is a bestselling author whose current book is " when we get to @entity6 : a journey through @entity8 in @entity9			1
" @entity10 , left , and @entity11 , right , at @entity13 's wedding to @entity14			1
( @entity3 ) -- after days on end of grim and dreary news , the first weekend of spring is with us , and with its arrival comes , to many people , the yearly promise of new romance and a chance for lasting love			1
but if figuring out the secrets of how to revive a battered economy is something that is complicated and elusive , that quandary is simple in comparison to matters of the heart			2
the legendary experts on romance , star - crossed and otherwise , are generally not available for comment			0
@entity35 have left the building			0
however , there is one person i know who has a better feel for the vagaries of love than most , and i sought her out the other day			1
" @entity43 is the time when you allow yourself to hope that love will come around again , " said @entity10			1
you may not recognize her full name , but you sure do recognize the first part of it			0
yep -- she 's that @entity10			1
the @entity10 of @entity13 's unforgettable 1957 hit , a song of longing and heartbreak that is instantly familiar today even to people who were n't born until decades after it came out			1
" if you knew @entity10 , then you 'd know why i feel blue ... " @entity58 , that other symbol of the glory of love , may have been a fictional creation of @entity64 's imagination , but @entity10 was , and is , real			1
she lives in @entity65 , just as she did when @entity13 recorded the song			1
she was actually not even his girlfriend , although she sensed a certain yearning on his part			0
she was the girlfriend of @entity11 , the drummer for the @entity70 , @entity14 's band			0
" i think the reason people think about finding love in the spring is that the season represents new beginnings , " she said			1
" the flowers are blooming			0
you feel that you have a chance			0
" in the song , @entity10 , implicitly , was the one who did the dumping , not the one who got dumped			1
but time has made her understand : " i think , i really believe , that on a rare occasion , two people in life run across each other in a path like two comets			0
and when it happens , i think that feeling lasts forever			0
" which is to say : with a love so rare and true			2
and that , she said , is what makes people keep looking for love regardless of how many times they may have tried and failed			2
she has a theory of what being in love does to a person : " your eyes are a little bit shinier and your skin is a little bit clearer when you 're in love			1
when you meet that person , you think : whatever you 're doing , i want to be right beside you when you 're doing it			2
i want to be near you just because i like to see your smile			0
" not that being @entity10 means she has all the answers			1
" i do n't , " she said			0
she is 68 now ; she has been married twice , divorced twice			0
when she introduces herself to new people , they often say , " oh -- like the @entity10 in the song ! " sometimes she tells them she is in fact that @entity10 ; sometimes she lets it go			1
it 's an uphill battle to convince them she 's not kidding			0
and as the woman who eternally will be a symbol of true love 's ways , she thinks she understands why people never give up on hoping to find the right person			1
" you have a tendency to put the walls up after you 've been hurt , " she said			0
" you think it 's not worth trying again			0
but then you do it anyway			0
it 's like it 's not even up to you			0
it 's stronger than your intellect			0
" for those who , as spring arrives , have just lost a great love , her advice for dealing with the sadness is to remember that some people never find love in their whole lives			1
" even if you 're the one to get left , you 've been lucky to have the feeling			0
and the feeling , unlike the person , will never leave you			2
" somewhere this spring -- many somewheres , undoubtedly -- the words , sung for the first time more than 50 years ago , will come blasting once again out of a car dashboard 's speakers : " pretty , pretty , pretty , pretty @entity10			1
" and people in 2009 , hearing it , will remember anew just how much happiness the right person can bring			2
" when i first heard the song , " @entity10 said , " i just thought the drums and the lyrics and the melody were so great , it made me want to get up and dance			1
as i grew older , it began to seem like more of a love song to me			2
it began to seem more like a song about not giving up			0
" living in @entity170 , @entity65 , a ham radio enthusiast in an age of @entity173 and text messages , she said she is currently not dating anyone			2
and with the arrival of spring , and its universal promise of life 's best possibilities , she acknowledges that there is hope in her own heart , too			1
" always , " said @entity10			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

he says she has a theory about what love does to a person
