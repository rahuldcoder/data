-- september 14 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 and @entity5 @entity6 @entity7 , @entity8 transcript this is a @entity11			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity15 , @entity16 : from @entity6 and @entity18 to @entity19 , we are bringing you headlines from around the world			2
@entity0 starts right this second ! first up : @entity26 @entity27 : first up : @entity26 is back in session			2
members of the @entity30 and @entity32 @entity31 have about a month to work on legislation , because we 're coming up on the midterm elections			1
now , we 've got a quick reminder for you on those			2
voters will cast ballots for all 435 members of the @entity31 , plus , around a third of the seats in the @entity30			2
primary elections have been running for months			2
there are more than a half - dozen of those today			1
the general election is on november 2nd			2
congressmen and women are looking at all sorts of issues , from the economy to food safety and military policies			2
but some analysts do n't think much is gon na happen on any subject , because they think members of @entity26 do n't want to get into controversial debates before the big election			2
one issue that @entity26 probably will get into , though , is a set of tax cuts			1
these were passed under former president @entity63			2
they 'll expire if @entity26 does n't vote to extend them , meaning taxes would go up			2
the big debate here is what to do about the tax cuts for @entity32 's wealthiest citizens , people who earn more than $ 250,000 a year			1
president @entity72 and most democrats do n't want to continue those cuts			1
they say @entity32 ca n't afford it , because the government needs the revenue that it would make from the taxes			1
most republicans -- and several @entity73 -- do want to extend the tax cuts , though , even if it 's just temporarily			1
they argue that the government should n't raise anyone 's taxes while the economy is in rough shape			1
taxes were on the minds of some @entity91 members over the weekend			2
they got together for a rally at the @entity32 @entity95 building and to protest against what they see as out - of - control government spending and too many taxes by the @entity32 government			1
the name of the rally -- " remember in november " -- was a reference to the upcoming midterm elections			2
wildfires @entity27 : firefighters are battling a pair of blazes in the @entity108			2
this one you see right now is in @entity5 , near the city of @entity111			2
it started sunday and spread fast			0
no reports of any injuries as of yesterday afternoon			0
investigators are looking into what started the fire			0
a local official said he hopes to get a handle on the situation " very quickly , " though he added that " very quickly " probably means a few days			0
the other wildfire is out in @entity4			0
this one broke out on sunday , too			0
more than 300 firefighters and emergency personnel are working to get it under control			0
but the weather is going to play a part in that			0
if the winds kick up , they can spread the flames			0
is this legit ? @entity133 , @entity16 : is this legit ? @entity6 is a communist country			0
true ! this means that @entity6 's government controls the country 's economy			1
@entity6 's economy @entity27 : we 're talking everything from factories and gas stations , to plumbers and ice cream shops			1
like a lot of countries , @entity6 's economy is struggling , and the government is planning to lay off at least half a million workers over the next six months			1
the nation 's president says that some of those people could find work through private companies , ones that are n't run by the government			1
@entity6 plans to allow more private businesses			0
some people think this might be a good thing , because they 'd be able to set their own prices or salaries			1
but , since @entity6 controls 90 percent of the country 's economy , finding new jobs could be tough			1
fruits and veggies @entity27 : it 's time for your " no kidding " headline of the day : @entity32 are n't eating enough fruits and vegetables			1
that 's according to the @entity175 , the @entity175			1
now , this is interesting : the percentage of @entity32 adults who eat enough fruit has actually decreased in the past decade ! in 2009 , around 32 percent of adults ate fruit at least twice a day			1
in 2000 , it was 34 percent			0
the government wants that number at 75 percent ! for vegetables : about a quarter of @entity32 adults ate vegetables at least three times a day			1
no real change from 2000			0
the government wants that number at 50 percent			0
so , why are n't we eating enough ? the @entity175 thinks there are two big reasons : one , it 's not as easy for everyone to get fresh fruits and veggies			1
two , they 're not as cheap as other foods			0
illusion of safety @entity27 : here 's a question for you to chew over : if you were driving near a school and a young girl ran into the street , what would you do ? a @entity208 video might help out with the answer			1
and that 's what this whole thing is designed to prevent			1
it 's not a real kid			1
it 's a @entity220 illusion			1
the group that 's behind it says the point is to get drivers to slow down in school zones			1
they put it out on the first day of school in @entity7 , @entity18			0
some critics are worried that the image could cause accidents if scared drivers swerve or slam on the brakes			0
this day in history ( @entity236 ) september 14 , 1901 -- president @entity237 dies of an infection 8 days after being shot september 14 , 1984 -- @entity239 begins first successful solo flight across the @entity241 by balloon september 14 , 1994 -- the @entity244 season is officially canceled after a players ' strike job seekers look overseas @entity27 : earlier today , we talked about how @entity6 's economy is struggling			1
it 's not the only one , as all of you know			1
the @entity32 economy , still trying to make its way out of the recession			1
one of the effects of a down economy is that it can be harder for people to find jobs			1
well , harder to find them in @entity32			1
@entity263 looks at why some @entity32 are seeking opportunities overseas			1
( begin video ) @entity266 , @entity32 : how do we say it ? picture			1
good ! @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 : @entity272 considers herself lucky to have this job as an @entity275 language tutor			0
even with a degree in international business and marketing , the @entity32 could not find a job for an entire year			1
finally , she told her mother she was going to take a bold step			0
@entity283 : i think i just want to move to @entity285			0
i think i 'm going to go to @entity285			0
she said , " are you crazy ? you 're gon na go to @entity285 ? " " yeah , @entity285			0
that 's where i 'm going to go			1
" @entity289 : @entity272 says she sensed the opportunities were in @entity291			1
so last year , she applied online for @entity275 teaching jobs in @entity285 and got three offers			0
@entity272 's pull towards @entity291 is not unusual these days			1
@entity296 firm says its @entity291 office has handled a 30 % increase in job applicants over the past six months			0
most job seekers are from the @entity32 , @entity301 and @entity302			1
@entity303 , @entity304 : there 's a feeling of frustration that they wanted to kickstart their careers again			1
they 've had a tough 18 months , and simply , the general attitude is they 've had enough			0
@entity289 : @entity313 says banks are hiring again and casting a wide net for top talent			2
but are the salaries the same ? @entity318 : good question			0
we 've certainly seen at least a 15 % increase on base salaries			0
@entity289 : while the bulk of the jobs here in @entity19 are in banking , finance and law , on the mainland , a lot of sectors are hiring			0
@entity285 needs industrial engineers for its high speed rail , also urban planners and architects for stimulus projects			0
on the mainland , recruiters report an upswing in overseas @entity285 returning for jobs			1
@entity313 says she 's also noticed an interesting spike in demand for math and science teachers at international schools on the mainland , perhaps as a result of more ex-pats moving to cities like @entity349 and @entity350			2
some schools are even offering relocation and housing allowances to attract teachers			0
@entity283 : do you wear rainboots ? @entity289 : back in @entity19 , @entity272 plans to eventually return home to @entity4			0
but with the @entity32 unemployment rate at 9.6 % , she 's not rushing to buy her plane ticket			1
@entity283 : actually , i 'm very nervous to go back			0
we 're talking about going back in a year or so , and i still do n't know if i 'll find work			2
@entity289 : until then , it 's a waiting game until the time is right			2

that 's around 9,000 pounds of championship chocolate			2
it was manufactured in @entity399 , but the beans for the chocolate came from @entity402			0
