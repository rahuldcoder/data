-- on january 19 , a team of at least 15 people assassinated @entity4 leader @entity3			1
@entity6 police released video footage of 11 of them			1
although it was obviously a very professional operation , the 27 minutes of video is fascinating in its banality			2
team members walk through the airport , check into and out of hotels , get into and out of taxis			0
they make no effort to hide themselves from the cameras , sometimes seeming to stare directly into them			1
they obviously do n't care that they 're being recorded , and -- in fact -- the cameras did n't prevent the assassination , nor as far as we know have they helped as yet in identifying the killers			1
@entity28 security cameras do n't substantially reduce crime			1
this fact has been demonstrated repeatedly : in @entity31 , @entity32 , public housing ; in a @entity42 apartment complex ; in @entity34 , @entity35 ; in @entity40 ; in study after study in both the @entity38 and the @entity39 nor are they instrumental in solving many crimes after the fact			0
there are exceptions , of course , and proponents of cameras can always cherry - pick examples to bolster their argument			2
these success stories are what convince us ; our brains are wired to respond more strongly to anecdotes than to data			0
but the data are clear : @entity61 cameras have minimal value in the fight against crime			2
although it 's comforting to imagine vigilant police monitoring every camera , the truth is very different , for a variety of reasons : technological limitations of cameras , organizational limitations of police and the adaptive abilities of criminals			1
no one looks at most @entity61 footage until well after a crime is committed			0
and when the police do look at the recordings , it 's very common for them to be unable to identify suspects			1
criminals do n't often stare helpfully at the lens and -- unlike the @entity6 assassins -- tend to wear sunglasses and hats			1
cameras break far too often			2
even when they afford quick identification -- think of the footage of the september 11 terrorists going through airport security or the july 7 @entity96 transport bombers just before the bombs exploded -- police are often able to identify those suspects even without the cameras			1
cameras afford a false sense of security , encouraging laziness when we need police to be vigilant			1
the solution is n't for police to watch the cameras more diligently			1
unlike an officer walking the street , cameras look only in particular directions at particular locations			2
criminals know this and can easily adapt by moving their crimes to places not watched by a camera -- and there will always be such places			2
and although a police officer on the street can respond to a crime in progress , someone watching a @entity61 screen can only dispatch an officer to arrive much later			0
by their very nature , cameras result in underused and misallocated police resources			2
cameras are n't completely ineffective , of course			1
used properly , they 're effective in reducing crime in enclosed areas with minimal foot traffic			0
combined with adequate lighting , they substantially reduce both personal attacks and auto - related crime in multistory parking garages			0
and sometimes it is cost - effective for a store to install cameras to catch shoplifters or a casino to install cameras to detect cheaters			2
but these are instances where there is a specific risk at a specific location			0
the important question is n't whether cameras solve past crime or deter future crime ; it 's whether they 're a good use of resources			1
they 're expensive , both in money and in their orwellian effects on privacy and civil liberties			0
their inevitable misuse is another cost ; police have spied on naked women in their own homes , shared nude images , sold best - of videos and even spied on national politicians			0
though we might be willing to accept these downsides for a real increase in security , cameras do n't provide that			1
despite our predilection for technological solutions over human ones , the funds now spent on cctv cameras would be far better spent on hiring and training police officers			0
we live in a unique time in our society : cameras are everywhere , but we can still see them			0
ten years ago , cameras were much rarer than they are today			0
ten years from now , they 'll be so small , you wo n't even notice them			0
already , people can buy surveillance cameras in household objects to spy on their spouses and baby sitters -- i particularly like the one hidden in a shower mirror -- or cameras in pens to spy on their colleagues , and they can remotely turn on laptop cameras to spy on anyone			0
companies are developing police state - type cctv surveillance technologies for @entity211 , technology that will find its way into countries like the @entity38 if universal surveillance were the answer , lots of us would have moved to the @entity219			0
if surveillance cameras were the answer , camera - happy @entity96 , with something like 500,000 of them at a cost of $ 700 million , would be the safest city on the planet			0
we did n't , and it is n't , because surveillance and surveillance cameras do n't make us safer			1
the money spent on cameras in @entity96 , and in cities across @entity38 , could be much better spent on actual policing			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity236			1

security cameras *documented* movements of suspects in @entity4 official 's killing
@entity236 says that for most part , cameras do n't make us safer
he says most video does n't get monitored , and criminals can evade video
*spending* money on other forms of law *enforcement* is wiser , he says
