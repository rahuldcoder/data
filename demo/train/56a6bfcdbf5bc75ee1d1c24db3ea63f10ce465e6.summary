-- in a down economy , pursuing the @entity2 dream can be challenging , but restaurant owner @entity4 was willing to take a chance			0
for nearly 20 years , @entity4 worked all levels of the restaurant game , from dishwasher to general manager , before partnering with his mom and opening his own eatery called @entity12 on @entity13 , @entity14 's , @entity16 streetcar line			1
" i would not have picked this spot if it were n't for the streetcar , and my business has certainly benefited from our location , " @entity4 said			1
" streetcars are also a romantic way to travel , and they are fun to watch from inside @entity24			1
" while @entity2 lost much of its love for streetcars as public transportation during the 1960s , a few cities have kept the romance burning			1
the heart of @entity32 includes its nearly 140 - year - old electric cable car system			0
in @entity38 , the location for @entity37 ' " @entity36 , " many tourists are drawn by the picturesque @entity39			0
the @entity41 administration recently offered some @entity2 cities a piece of a $ 130 million federal fund for streetcar projects aimed at reducing traffic congestion , cutting pollution and reliance on foreign oil , and creating jobs			1
transit systems in @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 , @entity56 , are slated to share grants from the @entity60 's @entity59 program			1
other cities have plans and other funding for streetcar projects , too			1
see map for key projects but not everyone is a fan of streetcars			1
" this is a waste of money , " said @entity68 of @entity69			1
" streetcars certainly create jobs , but they are a poor investment and create little lasting value , " he said			1
" because it requires extensive ongoing subsidies , it is also unsustainable			0
improving roads would be the better bet in most communities			0
" @entity0 ireporter @entity82 is a supporter			0
" sure , @entity13 paid incentives to businesses to build along the streetcar ( line ) , " he said			2
" but how is this any different than any governmental jurisdiction giving tax breaks and other incentives for businesses to relocate to a city or state ? " streetcars have transformed a " blighted warehouse district ... into a vibrant area of shops , grocery stores , restaurants and apartments that provide entertainment and employment , " he said			1
but there 's nothing streetcars can do that buses ca n't do better , faster , safer and for far less money , said @entity108 senior fellow @entity107			1
" even though a single light - rail train can hold more passengers than a bus , a bus route can move more passengers per hour than any light - rail line			0
" @entity13 's streetcar system attracts about 12,000 daily riders at an average ticket cost of $ 1.47			1
its creators credit it with $ 3.5 billion in surrounding development , including shops , restaurants and 10,000 new housing units			2
also , streetcars that run on either hydro or coal - generated electricity spit out less greenhouse gases per passenger mile than diesel buses , according to @entity132 researchers			2
so , what is a streetcar , exactly ? the transportation community generally defines it as a rail - based passenger tram that shares streets with cars and trucks			2
@entity82 said he rides his city 's system so often he 's considering selling his car			0
" riding public transportation in @entity13 is quick , easy and enjoyable , " he said			0
" it 's absolutely easier than driving , and streetcar operators go out of their way to be helpful			2
" but is it faster than driving ? " if you count the time from point a to @entity153 , it is slower to ride the streetcar , " @entity82 said			2
" but if you factor in time to find a place to park and the cost of parking , it is more convenient and cheaper to ride the streetcar			2
" it 's no secret that public transit offers commuters an escape from hectic traffic and a chance to read , make phone calls or snooze			2
these transportation issues were recently at the heart of an $ 85 million question faced by leaders and residents of @entity173 , @entity174 : should they green - light a proposed three - mile streetcar line from @entity178 through downtown and into the near - south side ? after much debate , city leaders decided " no " earlier this month " because of the timing and questions regarding how it would be fully funded			1
" as many as 2,250 people were projected to use the system daily , according to a city study			0
@entity68 says that 's not very many riders , considering the cost of building and maintaining the line			0
" most ridership projections are overly optimistic , " he said			0
" there are good reasons why most cities got rid of their trolley systems in the ' 50s and ' 60s			0
" read state - by - state data on how commuters get to work a federal transportation official acknowledged that ridership is often low , according to industry studies			0
in @entity206 , supporters are working to bring a light - rail line to revitalize downtown @entity208 , a city among the hardest hit by the recession			0
but on @entity213 , a @entity212 transportation committee spokesman acknowledged that there may be less federal money available for streetcar projects as @entity217 prepare to take control of the @entity212 in january			1
" based on recent decisions by party members at the state and national level , that will mean a renewed emphasis on roadway projects and less proposed funding for transit			0

@entity41 administration touts streetcars as a way to vitalize urban economies
feds offer $ 130 million to cities in @entity174 , @entity238 , @entity56 and @entity239
supporters : streetcars will create jobs , cut pollution , reduce traffic , *shrink* oil *dependence*
*opponents* : streetcar programs waste tax money that could be spent on road improvements
