@entity0 -- @entity3 's improbable success in the @entity4 has prompted a spate of " gee - whiz " stories and added " @entity9 " into everyday lexicon			1
the little known @entity10 , who at 6 ' 3 " ( 1.91 meters ) tall , has been leading the @entity11 to successive wins , even without its recognized superstars			0
" to pull off 20 +8 ( an average of 20 points and 8 assists ) in six successive games shows @entity3 is no fluke , " says @entity15 , a basketball commentator in @entity0			1
the @entity11 made it seven on wednesday after a 100 - 85 win over @entity22 in @entity23 , with @entity3 managing a career - high 13 assists			2
watching the 23 - year - old point guard spin a 360 , or finish a clean slam dunk , or sink a buzzer - beating three pointer against the best teams in the @entity4 is " incredible , " says @entity15 , himself a sharp - shooting former member of @entity32 's national basketball team			1
my family has also been quite giddy over @entity3 's successes			2
@entity32 and @entity36 vie for a piece of @entity3 i have been a basketball fanatic all my life			1
i played as a back up guard for the @entity42 varsity team when i studied there in the late 1970s			0
i sometimes play pick up games on sundays			0
vicariously , i feel like a winner whenever @entity3 wins			2
@entity47 , my 20 - something daughter has snapped up a @entity11 jersey bearing " no. 17 " and @entity3 's name			2
she had just bought a ticket for friday 's @entity11 game against the @entity53			0
her elder brother @entity54 , a @entity55 resident , can not stop talking about @entity3 's spectacular game last week against the vaunted @entity57			2
" it was intense , " he says			0
" sports commentators have been all over @entity3 after that game			1
" in @entity32 , sports fans and commentators are quick to claim @entity3 , an @entity63 born to @entity36 immigrants with roots in mainland @entity32			1
@entity4 's ' @entity9 ' offers marketing promise " he is @entity32 no matter what , " says @entity67 , a @entity68 - based sports commentator for @entity69			1
" he is associated with @entity32 and our culture , he knows the language -- though not fluent			2
" @entity67 says @entity3 visited @entity32 in the summer during the @entity4 lockout and had talked with @entity76 , the hulking @entity77 center who retired from the @entity4 last year			1
with their homegrown hero in retirement , millions of basketball fans in @entity32 are seeking a new role model			1
" @entity3 gives hope to regular - sized players , " says @entity67			1
" he shows that regardless of size , height and weight he could make his presence felt in the @entity4			0
he shows that we @entity32 can boast of more than just giant players like @entity76			1
" @entity90 , who also played in the @entity42 varsity team in the late 1970s , agrees			0
" previous @entity10 players in the @entity4 have been physically imposing , but few regular players can relate to @entity76			1
" @entity3 , hoops analysts say , fills @entity32 's point - guard gap			1
" like ( @entity97 ' point guard ) @entity98 , he combines a high basketball iq with athleticism			0
like @entity98 he makes his teammates better , " says @entity101			0
for decades , @entity32 basketball has been geared to finding super tall @entity32 who could be trained early to compete with the world 's best			1
in the minds of many @entity32 coaches and team managers , @entity32 and @entity109 in general can not compete with african - americans or @entity111 without height advantage			2
that is why @entity32 has failed to produce world - class point guards			2
" @entity3 's success is really an indictment of the @entity32 basketball system and its focus on developing big men , " says @entity101			1
" @entity32 has hundreds of millions of males , most of them regular size in stature and they can not develop a single @entity4 - caliber guard ? " @entity126 , author of " @entity127 , " a book on @entity32 basketball and the rise of @entity76 , explains : " the system basically recruits on height and also inculcates great obedience , discipline and hard work , but it does n't bring creativity , independence , and leadership , which are qualities that a great point guard needs			1
" @entity3 shows those qualities			2
" @entity3 was born in @entity63 , " says @entity15			1
" he has no language and cultural barriers and he is familiar with the @entity4			0
" @entity3 also has a growing legion of fans			1
on social media , he has more than one million followers on @entity148 , compared to his almost 400,000 followers on @entity150			0
others admire @entity3 , a university graduate , for striking a balance between education and sports			1
" in @entity32 , if you want to be a sports star , you go to sports schools to train and train and forget about attending a regular college , " says @entity69 's @entity67			2
" @entity3 is an excellent basketball player who also went to @entity159 , and that is why he is such an inspiring example for @entity32			1
" @entity3 also inspires @entity162 like @entity163 , editor of the @entity164 , an @entity166 journal who , like @entity3 , has ties with @entity36 and the mainland			1
" as a group we tend to be seen as sports challenged , " @entity163 explains			0
" the stereotype is that we excel in math or the violin so having someone like him who excels in mainstream @entity63 sport is refreshing			2
it brings a new dimension to who we are and what we can be			0
he also represents the @entity63 dream because of his underdog status			0
" @entity3 was overlooked by most @entity4 teams until the @entity11 , desperately looking for a point guard , picked him			0
he also earns much less than many of his teammates			0
but the question lingers : how long will @entity3 's magical run last ? " the @entity4 is a grind and he is not used to playing the minutes , " notes @entity101 , who watched @entity3 play for his high school team in @entity191 , @entity192			0
" opponents will get physical with him			0
when ( @entity11 superstar ) @entity197 comes back ( from injury ) , his minutes may go down			0
" still , former national team player @entity15 gives @entity3 a fair chance to score well			0
" he can use his high basketball iq to make up for his physical handicaps , " he says			0
that demands high @entity3 - tensity .			0
