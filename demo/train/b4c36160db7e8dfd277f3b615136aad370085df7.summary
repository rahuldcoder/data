-- under mounting pressure from activists and advertisers , @entity1 is ramping up efforts to stamp out hate speech , particularly depictions of violence against women			1
the move , announced tuesday , came after a weeklong campaign by women 's groups targeting pages that celebrated or made light of rape , domestic violence and sexual degradation of women			1
" in recent days , it has become clear that our systems to identify and remove hate speech have failed to work as effectively as we would like , particularly around issues of gender - based hate , " @entity19 , a @entity1 vice president in charge of public policy , wrote in a post on the site			1
" in some cases , content is not being removed as quickly as we want			0
in other cases , content that should be removed has not been or has been evaluated using outdated criteria			0
we have been working over the past several months to improve our systems to respond to reports of violations , but the guidelines used by these systems have failed to capture all the content that violates our standards			2
we need to do better -- and we will			0
" a coalition of women 's groups , under the banner @entity43 , celebrated the announcement , saying that @entity1 has asked them to be part of an ongoing conversation about improvements to the social network			1
pages flagged as offensive by the group had such names as " kicking your girlfriend in the @entity56 , " " @entity57 , " " @entity58 " and " @entity59 in the uterus			2
" searching for those pages wednesday delivered no results			2
" it is because @entity1 has committed to having policies to address these issues that we felt it was necessary to take these actions and press for that commitment to fully recognize how the real world safety gap experienced by women globally is dynamically related to our online lives , " author @entity63 , who helped spearhead the effort , said in a post on the group 's site			1
in @entity80 's post , @entity1 promised to : -- update guidelines that its @entity83 team uses to identify hate speech , with help from legal experts and women 's groups -- update training for team members who police hate speech -- increase accountability for @entity1 users whose pages do n't legally qualify as hate speech but who post content that is " cruel or insensitive " -- implement a policy that requires users who create pages with questionable content to publicly attach their personal account to them -- encourage groups already working on cyber-hate issues to include the women 's coalition			1
" these are complicated challenges and raise complex issues , " @entity80 wrote			0
" our recent experience reminds us that we ca n't answer them alone			0
" tasked with policing a site with roughly 1 billion users , @entity1 says it has sought to strike a balance between cracking down on hateful content while still allowing for freedom of expression			2
" we seek to provide a platform where people can share and surface content , messages and ideas freely , while still respecting the rights of others , " @entity80 said			0
" to facilitate this goal , we also work hard to make our platform a safe and respectful place for sharing and connection			0
this requires us to make difficult decisions and balance concerns about free expression and community respect			0
" such issues have come up repeatedly in the past , notably when @entity1 users created fan pages celebrating accused @entity142 theater shooter @entity140 or @entity144 bombing suspect @entity143			1
the recent campaign by women 's groups was launched last tuesday with an open letter to @entity1 complaining about pages deemed offensive			1
the letter complained of a double standard toward imagery on the site in light of past controversies over @entity1 removing more innocuous content , such as photos of women breastfeeding			1
" these pages and images are approved by your moderators , while you regularly remove content such as pictures of women breastfeeding , women post-mastectomy and artistic representations of women 's bodies , " read the letter , signed by dozens of women 's groups from around the world			1
" it appears that @entity1 considers violence against women to be less offensive than nonviolent images of women 's bodies			1
" in a world in which hundreds of thousands of women are assaulted daily and where intimate partner violence remains one of the leading causes of death for women around the world , it is not possible to sit on the fence			2
we call on @entity1 to make the only responsible decision and take swift , clear action on this issue , to bring your policy on rape and domestic violence into line with your own moderation goals and guidelines			1
" on @entity196 , supporters posted violent images they said were originally shared on @entity1 pages			1
they included a picture of a woman at the bottom of a stairwell with the caption , " next time , do n't get pregnant " and multiple postings of a dramatized photo of a man threatening a frightened woman with captions like " dishes : do them now " and " women deserve equal rights ... and lefts			0
" the letter also encouraged people to contact @entity1 advertisers			2
according to the group , supporters sent more than 5,000 e-mails to advertisers , in addition to posting messages to advertisers on @entity196 and @entity1 itself			2
the group claims that 15 companies said they were pulling their ads from @entity1 as a result of the efforts			1
@entity230 @entity229 and @entity231 were among those who announced they were doing so while others , like @entity236 soap , said they were working with @entity1 on a solution			2
" we fully support that today @entity238 reached a joint position on rights , " @entity230 @entity229 posted on its @entity196 feed late tuesday			0
user responses on @entity1 's post were mixed			1
while many of the roughly 300 comments wednesday morning thanked the site , others suggested it was n't enough or speculated that it would n't have happened without pressure from advertisers			0
there was also pushback from users who called it a threat to free speech			0
" oh look , " said user @entity255			0
" the hurt feelings police is attempting to undermine the @entity257 again			0
" many , however , seemed optimistic -- but cautious			0
" it 's a start but i 'll believe it when i see it in the long term , " wrote user @entity258			0
" we need to make sure @entity1 follows up on this			2
" @entity1 's community standards page says , " @entity1 does not permit hate speech , but distinguishes between serious and humorous speech			1
while we encourage you to challenge ideas , institutions , events , and practices , we do not permit individuals or groups to attack others based on their race , ethnicity , national origin , religion , sex , gender , sexual orientation , disability or medical condition			0
