-- those trying to reinstitute proposition 8 -- the voter - backed referendum to ban gay marriage in @entity5 -- lost once again in court on wednesday , meaning no stop to such legal unions that resumed a few weeks ago			1
in two brief rulings , @entity5 supreme court chief justice @entity9 dismissed attempts by opponents of same - sex marriage			1
one was brought by @entity15 , the group that 's led legal efforts defending what 's known as @entity18 , and the other came from a @entity21 clerk who 'd argued the state had put him in an " untenable position " by compelling him to sign off on marriage licenses for gay and lesbian couples			1
the rulings were the latest in a spate of decisions -- at the state and federal level , including the @entity33 @entity32 -- that have gone against those trying to restrict marriage in the @entity5 to between one man and one woman			2
attorney general @entity38 was among those gay marriage supporters who cheered wednesday 's ruling , much as they have the others in recent months			1
she tweeted : " the @entity5 supreme court has denied the # prop8 proponents ' request to halt same - sex marriages ! " " # @entity51 dead for good , " tweeted @entity46 , the state 's biggest gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender advocacy group			1
refuses last remaining legal challenge			0
@entity55 to marry here to stay			0
" those on the other side of the debate , meanwhile , lamented wednesday 's ruling and more generally criticized state leaders who , in their view , had " silenced more than 7 million @entity5 who clearly expressed their views			2
" case challenges @entity66 's ban on same - sex marriage " though the current @entity5 officials are unwilling to support the state constitution , we remain hopeful that one day @entity5 will elect officials who will , " @entity55 , a legal advocacy organization , said in a statement			1
" ... the court 's decision today ... does not end the debate about marriage in @entity5			1
" in may 2008 , @entity5 's @entity32 struck down the state 's ban on same - sex marriage , ruling that the state 's constitution gives " this basic civil right to ( marry to ) all @entity5 , whether gay or heterosexual , and to same - sex couples as well as to opposite - sex couples			1
" the tide turned a few months later , when 52 % of voters backed @entity18 to halt gay and lesbian marriages			0
yet state officials declined to stand behind the prohibition , even if private parties did			0
a federal appeals court subsequently ruled that @entity18 was unconstitutional , though it still issued a stay on same - sex marriages until the @entity33 @entity32 could weigh in			1
that happened june 26 , when the nation 's high court -- in a 5 - 4 decision -- dismissed an appeal of the earlier lower court ruling on narrow , jurisdictional grounds			0
midnight vows : same - sex couples ring in new lives as law takes effect two days later , the @entity108 officially lifted the previous injunction , and same - sex weddings took place very soon thereafter			0
@entity18 backers tried to get the @entity33 @entity32 to again intervene , but justice @entity113 refused to do so			0
efforts continued , though , in the state court system			0
one came from @entity21 clerk @entity116 , who last month asked the @entity5 @entity32 to order gov. @entity117 , @entity118 and other state officials to abide by an " immediate temporary stay " to once again halt same - sex marriages			2
@entity116 argued that he had been " threatened with legal action by the attorney general for exercising his public duties consistent with state law defining marriage as the union between one man and one woman			0
" yet the state @entity32 responded days later by denying the county clerk 's request to stop same - sex marriages immediately			2
on wednesday , @entity9 officially dismissed @entity116 's petition .			0
