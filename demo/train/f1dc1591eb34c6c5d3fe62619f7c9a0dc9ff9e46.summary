-- the surviving members of @entity2 do n't have many kind words for the recent pardon of legendary singer @entity5 by @entity7 authorities			1
outgoing @entity7 gov. @entity8 helped pave the way for the pardon earlier this month , clearing @entity5 from a 40 - year - old indecent exposure arrest and conviction			1
but @entity5 's old bandmates , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 , said the gesture was too little too late			2
" we do n't feel @entity5 needs to be pardoned for anything , " @entity2 members said in a statement wednesday			1
" the charges against him were largely an opportunity for grandstanding by ambitious politicians -- not to mention an affront to free speech and a massive waste of time and taxpayer dollars			0
" the statements also said : " if the @entity7 and the @entity33 want to make amends for the travesty of @entity5 's arrest and prosecution 40 years after the fact , an apology would be more appropriate -- and expunging the whole sorry matter from the record			1
" @entity5 had been performing with the band at a typically raucous concert at @entity33 's @entity43 on march 1 , 1969 , when the incident took place			0
reportedly drunk and slurring obscenities at the crowd , he was accused of unzipping his pants and simulating a sex act , a charge he denied			2
despite being acquitted of lascivious behavior and drunkenness , @entity5 was convicted of indecent exposure and open profanity , and sentenced to six months in jail			0
he was still appealing the verdict in 1971 when he died in @entity57 of a heart attack at the age of 27			0
he would have turned 67 on wednesday			0
doors fans have long appealed for an official pardon for " the @entity5 , " petitioning previous @entity7 governors without success			1
many argue that the trial was a sham and that there was no conclusive evidence supporting the exposure charge against @entity5 .			0
