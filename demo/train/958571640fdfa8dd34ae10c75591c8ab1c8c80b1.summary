-- authorities said friday that they will begin digging for evidence of graves at a @entity5 ranch that once was home to the infamous " family " of convicted killer @entity6			1
authorities said they will start digging at @entity8 , @entity6 's hideout			1
soil testing to determine the possible presence of buried bodies was inconclusive , authorities said friday , so " exploratory excavation " will be done this month , @entity13 county sheriff @entity13 said			1
the dig will be carried out " to either confirm or put to rest speculation that bodies may remain there from the @entity6 era , " @entity13 said in a written statement			1
in march , search crews found indications that human remains may lie within a few yards of @entity8 , the onetime hideout of the @entity6			1
the sites were identified by trained dogs , and testing equipment from the @entity27 also indicated the possible presence of remains , said sgt. @entity30 of the @entity31 , @entity5 , police department			0
the excavation will take place at sites where cadaver dogs gave mixed indications and soil testing was inconclusive , @entity13 said			1
" there was no consistent response from the dogs that searched , and no conclusive findings from the soil samplings tested by top experts in the field , " he said			1
" therefore , i believe the only way to determine once and for all whether there are bodies buried at @entity8 from the time of the @entity6 is to proceed with limited excavation in a very few areas			2
" he said four methods of testing were used at five sites on the ranch			0
no site was identified by all four methods as possibly having remains , but positive findings by one method were corroborated by another at some of the sites , the sheriff 's department said			2
the excavations will begin may 20 and continue through about may 23 , although additional days will be added if needed , he said			0
@entity8 is @entity67 property and will be closed to the public during the excavation , the sheriff 's department said			0
media access will be limited , but daily briefings will be provided			0
after @entity30 's dog and another dog , from @entity74 , a nonprofit organization that specializes in finding clandestine graves , indicated the possible presence of human remains , testing equipment from @entity80 's @entity27 laboratory indicated two likely grave sites and a third possible grave site , @entity30 said			1
@entity6 and four others were convicted of murder and other charges in connection with a two - night spree in august 1969 that included the slaying of actress @entity89			2
the slayings -- and @entity6 and his family members -- transfixed the nation			2
@entity6 is serving a life sentence at @entity5 's @entity94			1
@entity0 sent letters to him and to co-defendant " @entity96 , asking whether there were victims buried behind @entity8			0
@entity6 did not reply , but @entity99 did , writing in a letter : " i was the first family member to go to the desert after the murders and also the first to leave			2
i say this only to let you know that no one was killed while i was in the desert			0
but i do n't know what took place after i left			0
i do n't think there were any more killed , i hope not ! i have absolutely nothing to hide			0
