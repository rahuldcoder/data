-- the blown - out well at the heart of the worst oil spill in @entity7 history has been cemented shut and is " effectively dead , " the federal government 's point man for the disaster said sunday			1
" additional regulatory steps will be undertaken but we can now state , definitively , that the @entity11 well poses no continuing threat to the @entity13 , " former coast guard adm. @entity8 announced			1
president @entity14 hailed the " final termination " of the ruptured well , but said the federal government will continue to do " everything possible to make sure the @entity17 recovers fully from this disaster			1
" the well erupted on april 20 and spewed an estimated 4.9 million barrels ( 206 million gallons ) of crude into the @entity13 before it was temporarily capped in july			2
its owner , oil giant @entity25 , began its final cementing operations to cap the well on friday			1
the death of the well is a milestone that likely will draw only momentary celebration			0
as scientists debate how much oil remains below the surface , years of economic and environmental recovery in the region lie ahead			1
the federal government will press for answers on what went wrong april 20 and lawsuits -- including those brought by the families of the 11 workers who died in the @entity44 rig explosion -- will eventually make their way through the courts			0
@entity25 stopped the oil july 15 , but pumping the bottom of the well with concrete -- the " bottom kill " -- was the final step in a five - month operation to ensure it will not leak			1
" this spill began with a bang , ends with a whimper , and leaves a number of issues still screaming for attention , " rep. @entity53 , @entity54 , said saturday			0
" this may be the final nail in the coffin for @entity25 's well , but the investigations into this crime against the environment are continuing			1
inquiries by @entity70 , the @entity14 administration 's independent panel , and others will progress until every inch of this environmental crime scene has been examined and a full autopsy has been performed on the spill 's effects , " @entity53 's statement said			1
the well operation is wrapping up as the company works to repair its image since the disaster			0
so far , @entity25 has said it has paid $ 1.6 billion in claims and government payments			2
" @entity25 is doing everything we can to make this right			0
we continue to ... clean up the environment , and make sure that people are compensated for legitimate claims , " its website says			0
chief executive @entity92 was moved to other duties partially because of a perceived lack of empathy for the victims of the spill			0
@entity92 recently testified before a @entity99 parliamentary committee about the failure of the well 's blowout preventer , which is now in custody of the @entity104 and a focus of a criminal investigation into the disaster			0
@entity25 shouldered some responsibility for the @entity13 oil disaster after an internal investigation of the spill , but assigned much of the blame to contractors @entity113 and @entity114			1
faulty cementing , a misread pressure test and the improperly maintained blowout preventer all contributed to the april 20 explosion , @entity25 's nearly 200 - page report on the disaster concluded			1
" the team did not identify any single action or inaction that caused this accident , " @entity25 's report states			2
" rather , a complex and interlinked series of mechanical failures , human judgments , engineering design , operational implementation and team interfaces came together to allow the initiation and escalation of the accident			0
multiple companies , work teams and circumstances were involved over time			0
" both @entity113 and @entity114 sharply disputed the findings , with @entity114 calling them " self - serving " and @entity113 insisting that the problem lay with @entity25 's well design			2
government scientists have estimated that at least 200 million gallons of oil leaked from @entity25 's damaged well , but 74 percent of it subsequently evaporated , broke up , or was skimmed or burned off			1
a team of researchers in the @entity13 say they found an oily layer as thick as two inches coating the sea floor in some places , and they believe it may be from the @entity25 spill			2
" i think what we 're seeing is oil that was on the surface , that has sedimented down to the bottom , " said @entity150 of the @entity151			0
an analyst from the @entity157 cautioned against jumping to conclusions before the samples are chemically analyzed .			0
