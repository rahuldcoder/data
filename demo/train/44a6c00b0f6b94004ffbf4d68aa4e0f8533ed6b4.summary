-- interaction , not isolation : @entity0 talks to @entity3 about his vision for a world where the @entity6 binds our communities together and strengthens the bonds between us all			1
@entity0 : @entity3 , what effect do you think the @entity6 has had on communities ? @entity3 believes the @entity6 will bind our communities more strongly together @entity3 : when the @entity6 really first started to hit , people felt this would be the death blow : after suburbs and long commutes and television and the death of the family dinner , this would be the last straw that would totally break society			1
no one would ever have a relationship , a conversation or a functional family relationship ever again			0
but what we found was the opposite : the @entity6 is proving to be the antidote to all those sort of things			2
it 's bringing people back together			2
it 's actually taking time out of television , especially for younger kids			0
@entity0 : what elements have you noticed in particular ? as : the @entity6 has made some phenomenal breakthroughs that are still only poorly understood in terms of changing people 's ideas of us and them			1
if mass media , social isolation in the suburbs , alienating workplaces and long car commutes create a bunker mentality , the @entity6 does the opposite			1
@entity0 : so what you 're saying is , the @entity6 brings us together ? as : yes			2
it makes people suddenly aware that there are people who are like us in lots of different ways ; and maybe you have connections to people who you normally would n't consider your buddies			0
they could live in another country but share your love of a particular band ; or live in your community and believe what you believe about a local issue			0
they could be someone you hit it off with online who maybe comes from a slightly different walk of life and you 'd never bump into them in normal social circumstances			2
for most people , using the @entity6 broadens their sense of who " we " is and actually ends up leaving us in a place of greater compassion and understanding			1
it leaves us more connected to a larger group of people and more at one with a lot more people in our community			0
@entity0 : how has the way that people use the internet changed ? as : people -- especially the geeks who created it -- have tended to look at the internet as something that 's hermetically sealed : there 's the @entity6 and the rest of the world			1
but that 's not how people want to use the @entity6			1
they want to use it as a way of better navigating the real world			1
people use tools like their laptops and their mobile phones as an opportunity to connect with others -- to meet , go out , find a restaurant , order a book from the library , figure out what the weather 's going to be like or participate in some local political issue			0
people are doing these things with increasing regularity			0
@entity0 : it does n't sound like the @entity6 that a lot of people imagine			1
as : it 's something that the people who are most famous as @entity6 experts of the last generation did n't really anticipate : that most people do n't want to stay in their little cubicles and play internet games all night			1
most people want to get dates , buy presents more easily or meet up with their friends and family -- " where can i go to get the business of life done more efficiently and be more like the person i want to be ? " @entity0 : when did people first use the internet as a campaigning tool ? as : the most notable examples , although people did n't comment on them at the time , were the anti-war protests at the beginning of the second @entity154 war			1
all over the world , enormous numbers of people got together to protest the idea of that war			2
that was done almost entirely with online advocacy			1
most of the people putting together those protests were tiny little groups that really did n't have the budget to do it in the normal way -- sending out lots of flyers , having people build phone trees			0
this time round , it was web sites , e-mails and text messages , and lots of people talking			0
@entity0 : what sort of an impact do you think the @entity6 had on those protests ? as : i do n't think those protests could have happened the way they happened before those tools were available			2
however , it 's an intermediate step , not least because it showed that protests of that sort -- a bunch of people using new technologies to go hold signs together -- are not as effective as they need to be , because essentially the @entity192 could say , " i do n't care			0
" @entity0 : so what do you think the next step would be ? as : we 're still figuring out what the next step is			0
i think we 're going to start to see a new model of civic advocacy where people get together once in a while to protest , but it 's more about an ongoing , sustained engagement in issues , networks and communities about which people care			1
we 're already seeing the beginnings of it			0
there 's this great phrase , " continuous partial attention , " to describe what people do online			2
they look at a little thing here , a little thing there , and they keep track of it all			0
it 's the ultimate multi-tasking in our brains			0
we 're going to see the @entity6 facilitate continuous partial attention more and more for local issues , for political issues , for community events , for things happening in your social network			1
we will find that 's a great deal more attention than people previously paid with these things			0
while it 's still in the early days , when it really comes to fruition it 's really going to change everything			0
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... what do you think of @entity3 's vision ? will technology help us build a brighter , fairer tomorrow ? tell us in the forum -- or read others ' thoughts on the future			1

@entity3 says the @entity6 can bring communities closer together
technology now an essential part of social networking
internet use helps people navigate the ' real ' world
increase in online advocacy and use of the internet for campaigning
