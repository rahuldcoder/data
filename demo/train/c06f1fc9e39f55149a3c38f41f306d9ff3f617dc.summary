-- @entity1 may be the latest application with a new mobile payment feature launched this week , but the idea that made @entity5 possible was spawned more than seven years ago in @entity6			1
when @entity8 came on the scene in 2007 -- a money transfer system devised by @entity11 and @entity13 - based @entity12 - it sparked a mini-revolution			1
with the touch of a button , relatives in @entity16 could transfer cash instantly to their remote up - country families without the need for bank accounts , bureaucracy , and sometimes long journeys to settle accounts			1
experimental beginnings initially launched as an experiment in creating a development impact through a private - sector solution , and seeded with as little as £ 2 million ( us $ 3.1 million ) in competition money , the system has gone from strength to strength			1
@entity8 has nearly 17 million active customers and as many as 186,000 agents worldwide			1
customers make more than € 900 million ( us $ 1.1 billion ) worth of person - to - person transactions a month			2
in 2013 , it shifted a massive us $ 22 billion in wireless financial transactions			0
now , the technology that was honed in @entity6 is being exported to @entity41 , with the launch of the mobile wallet technology in @entity44			1
" the majority of people in @entity44 have at least one mobile device , but more than one - third of the population do not have access to conventional banking , " said @entity11 director of mobile money , @entity45			1
while it is early days in @entity44 -- the company only made its active launch in august this year -- analysts are cautiously optimistic about the prospects for its success			1
" by @entity11 's estimation , 35 percent of the @entity44 population do n't use banking services and , if you look at @entity11 's footprint in @entity41 , @entity44 is one of the places where @entity8 stands the best chance of gaining adoption , " mobile analyst for @entity62 @entity61 told @entity0			1
" in more developed markets , like the @entity73 and @entity74 , there is n't a role for this type of payment system			0
this service really works where people need an alternative to traditional banking			0
" expanded potential when @entity12 partnered with @entity11 , the intention had been to develop a system for women , usually the recipients of microfinance , to repay micro-loans cheaply and quickly			0
but after @entity12 's management team looked at the application , they saw it had a greater potential			0
@entity13 now use it to pay school fees , taxes , traffic fines , and more recently it 's been extended to give people the ability to save and to borrow			1
other more sophisticated financial services are also being introduced			0
the mobile payment system covers microinsurance , payrolls and even distributors like @entity106 , which deliver beer to bars , take @entity8 payments rather than have the delivery trucks go around with cash			1
it has even extended into @entity13 's real estate and rental market with a service called @entity116 — swahili for " pay your rent			2
" @entity13 's rental market is a large and growing segment ( the latest census estimated there were 6.5 million rental households ) as the country rapidly urbanizes			1
valued at around 17.2 billion @entity13 shillings ( us $ 200 million ) , it represents a fifth of the total value of the real estate market in @entity13			2
within five years , @entity8 contributes almost 20 % of @entity12 's total revenue and has been rolled out in @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 , before first venturing outside @entity6 into @entity135			2
@entity137 appeal while it was originally designed for and aimed at those at the bottom of the pyramid , @entity8 is used by almost everyone that needs to move money in @entity13 , allowing users to transfer between us $ 1,500 -- us $ 1,600 per day			1
recent services , such as the credit application @entity146 , however , have come under fire over what critics claim are high levels of interest charged to @entity13 's poorest			2
even though the loans are small , typically just $ 300 , they have a 30 - day term at 7.5 %			0
on an annualized basis , critics say , the loans attract an interest rate of about 100 %			0
additionally , a higher rate of interest applies if the loan is paid either early or late and a subscriber 's savings account is frozen up to the amount due			0
nevertheless , for many analysts , @entity8 is an example of a successful social enterprise — a system that not only has a clear social benefit but returns a profit as well			2
for detractors of @entity6 's dependence on foreign aid , applications like @entity8 are the way forward			0
ironically , aid organizations are using @entity8 themselves to direct cash payments			0
" when it was started , it was n't even conceived as a social enterprise ; i do n't think it was even a popular term at the time , " @entity12 ceo @entity180 told @entity181			0
" but now , @entity184 , which distributes aid — and often this aid evaporates ; it 's stolen — these guys use @entity8 to get the benefit directly to the person who is receiving it			0
" read more from tomorrow transformed : can the web predict the future ? the @entity192 from science fiction is coming finally , a flying car for everybody ?			0
