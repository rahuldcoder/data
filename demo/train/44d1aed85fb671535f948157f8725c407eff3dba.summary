to become @entity1 's first female engineer in 1999 -- and , eventually , one of the most powerful women in tech -- @entity5 had to get comfortable with risk			1
" i always did something i was a little not ready to do , " she said last year while speaking on her best decisions in a talk with @entity10 correspondent @entity9			2
" that feeling at the end of the day , where you 're like , ' what have i gotten myself into ? ' i realized that sometimes when you have that feeling and you push through it , something really great happens			0
" if the 37 - year - old still makes career moves by her tried - and - true process , then she 's likely anticipating something great to occur in her new role as @entity24 's ceo			1
@entity26 's hiring last summer , which accordng to @entity27 made her the youngest head of a @entity27 company , came as a surprise , and her high - wire decisions since have spread far wider than @entity24 's campus			1
first , there was her brief maternity leave after she gave birth to her son in september			0
when the @entity39 star first announced that she was pregnant , on the very same day @entity24 revealed she was the company 's new ceo , some saw it as a progressive move and hoped @entity26 would set a new standard for mothers trying to balance the competing demands of their corporate and familial roles			1
what they saw instead was a businesswoman eager to get back in the office and who said that having a new baby in her life was n't as difficult as she 'd been told			0
but the real critiques came last month when @entity24 's @entity55 department issued an e-mail telling staff that they will no longer be able to work from home , prompting an angry backlash and leading some to question @entity26 's judgment			1
while some found her position just , others hoping the new mom would create a more reasonable corporate culture interpreted the move as unfair , noting that @entity26 approved the edict while building a nursery next to her office -- not an option for most working parents			1
but over her nearly 14 - year career in the tech world , @entity26 has consistently shaken up expectations			1
if we 've learned anything about this influential computer engineer - turned - corporate executive , it 's that she plays the game of business by her own rules			1
she does n't do stereotypes part of the legend of @entity5 is that she does n't fit into our assumptions of what it means to be a tech geek			1
much has been made of her looks , which defy popular culture 's assertion that the best computer scientists are " people with pocket protectors and thick glasses who code all night , " @entity26 told @entity99 magazine jokingly in 2009			1
" i do code all night ! i am the stereotype , but i also break the stereotype			0
" she also did n't grow up immersed in technology			0
born in @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity26 had a childhood filled with piano lessons , ice skating and ballet , plus debate and math club in high school , @entity103 reported in 2009			1
the future tech leader told @entity114 the following year that she did n't even learn how to use a mouse until her freshman year at @entity117			2
she 's said that she had a natural interest in the brain and how it worked , and at first wanted to be a pediatric neurosurgeon			2
when she happened to take a computer science class for non-majors and discovered a major called symbolic systems , she was hooked , she told @entity10 's @entity9 last year			2
soon she was climbing @entity1 's ranks , from programmer to vice president of local , maps and location services			2
but the press and public focused more on her posing for @entity103 and reportedly shelling out $ 60,000 at a charity auction for lunch with @entity135			0
a geek who loves fashion ? who would 've thought ? but as @entity26 told the @entity141 in 2009 , " i refuse to be stereotyped			1
i think it 's very comforting for people to put me in a box			2
' oh , she 's a fluffy girlie girl who likes clothes and cupcakes			2
oh , but wait , she is spending her weekends doing hardware electronics			0
@entity150 can trump gender with two degrees from @entity117 , including a master 's degree in computer science , and a successful career in a male - dominated industry , @entity26 is often held up as a woman to emulate			1
during her tenure at @entity1 , @entity26 's been described as being a key influencer on products such as @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity1 's minimalist search page			1
as a result , @entity26 is frequently asked how she made it in an environment that 's seen as a boy 's club			1
" people will say , how can we get more girls into computer science ? and i think that 's a hard question , because just asking the question , i worry sometimes can handicap progress , " she noted during a 2012 talk at @entity178 's 92nd @entity177 " i was really good at chemistry , biology , physics , calculus in high school , and my teachers were genuinely really supportive of that and they never said anything like , ' wow , you 're really good at this , and that 's unusual for a girl			0
' they never really brought up the gender issue ... and i think i 've just always been very gender - unaware			0
" her advice to other women seeking to follow in her footsteps is to find something that drives them and push past their preconceptions about gender roles			0
" i 'm not a woman at @entity1 , i 'm a geek at @entity1 , " @entity26 told @entity203 in 2012			2
" if you can find something that you 're really passionate about , whether you 're a man or a woman comes a lot less into play			0
@entity150 is a gender - neutralizing force			0
" and when it comes to feminism , @entity26 shies away from the phrase			2
" i do n't think that i would consider myself a feminist			0
i certainly believe in equal rights , i believe that women are just as capable , if not more so , in a lot of different dimensions			0
but i do n't i think have sort of the militant drive , and sort of the chip on the shoulder that sometimes comes with that , " she said in @entity219 and @entity221 's " makers " documentary , launching a debate about her remarks			0
" i think it 's too bad , but i do think that feminism has become in many ways a more negative word , " she added			0
" there are amazing opportunities all over the world for women , and i think that there 's more good that comes out of positive energy around that than negative energy			0
burnout ? she 's not really buying it @entity26 has long been seen as the employee who can outwork you on your most caffeinated day			1
but she 's said that she does n't believe in burnout in the typical sense			0
" i actually have a very different philosophy about burnout , " she told @entity251 last year			0
" i do n't think that burnout comes from not getting enough sleep or not eating enough square meals			0
i think that burnout comes from resentment			0
... it is possible to work ' too hard , ' but you need to figure out what things it really is you need to stay fueled up , to stay energized , to not get resentful			0
" @entity26 's intensity at the office appears to have held up even as she 's become a mom			1
her maternity leave was just a few weeks long , and she worked through it			0
some critics wondered about the standard this might set in the corporate world , considering @entity26 has resources that many other working parents do n't			2
yet the @entity24 ceo is n't thinking about anyone else 's standards of parenthood , as she told " today 's " @entity280 when asked for her thoughts on being seen as a role model			1
" i 've really been focused on the products , what we need to do , " @entity26 said last month			2
" there are so many great people at @entity24 , and so many great users that we want to serve well , that i really put my energy there			2
she welcomes challenges one of @entity26 's mantras for making decisions in life is to a ) work with the smartest people she can find , and b ) go for a challenge that makes her feel like she 's in over her head			1
say , for example , taking over struggling web giant @entity24			2
@entity24 's undoubtedly hoping for a turnaround in both its finances and its products , one worth that $ 1.1 million bonus that @entity26 was given			1
optimistic observers are waiting to see @entity26 apply some of the smarts and aesthetic sense she showed at @entity1			2
" if @entity26 were just another savvy @entity39 executive who 'd spent most of her career at one outfit and never run a company , she might feel like a quixotic choice for a big , troubled public company like @entity24 , " @entity312 's @entity311 wrote last july			1
" but she 's @entity5			1
she played a key role in making @entity1 into ... @entity1			0
she 's famous for her obsessive focus on pleasing experiences , and the lengths to which she 'll go to measure whether something 's working for users or not			0
if she needs to test 41 different shades of blue , she will @entity26 told @entity329 magazine in 2008 that she 's " a businesswoman first and foremost , " but her passion for perfection and focus on data has n't left everyone starstruck			1
former staffer @entity334 , who wrote " i 'm feeling lucky : the @entity338 of @entity339 59 , " recalled feeling perturbed by @entity26 's emphasis on testing and data			1
he remembered one occurrence when he said she changed the results @entity1 provided so they 'd appear in a sans - serif font , because she 'd seen research that those were easier to read			0
the @entity141 similarly picked up on @entity26 's data - driven habits and perfectionism , such as when she wanted to test out 41 shades of blue for the toolbar on @entity1 pages to see which one appealed the most to the user			1
her managerial style was said to be so meticulous that @entity353 put her on its 2012 list of " brilliant " but tough tech bosses			0
@entity356 will tell if this obsessive attention to detail pays off for @entity24 , and @entity26 -- or whether her company 's problems are too big .			1

@entity24 ceo @entity5 : my best decisions involve risk
it may not be *conventional* , but neither is @entity26
as she 's shown in the past , @entity26 bucks against *societal* expectations
in the *fields* of tech and business , @entity26 often makes her own rules
