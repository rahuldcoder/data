-- here 's a question for you : what do you think life in the @entity5 would be like if there were no minimum wage ? if employers were allowed to pay workers anything they wanted ? would much of @entity5 life turn into something out of @entity13 ? or would the country flourish ? it 's not as outrageous a notion as it sounds			1
for most of the time this nation has existed , that was the case : there simply was no such thing as a minimum wage			1
right now the minimum - wage debate is in the news because president @entity25 has proposed that it be raised			1
currently , the federal minimum wage is $ 7.25 per hour ; @entity25 wants it to be raised to $ 9 per hour			1
in his @entity30 address this month , the president said : " let 's declare that in the wealthiest nation on @entity33 , no one who works full - time should have to live in poverty			0
" the political battle will be over how much -- if at all -- the $ 7.25 minimum wage should be raised			1
there is significant opposition to an increase ; rep. @entity41 of @entity42 , speaker of the house of representatives , summed it up when he said : " when you raise the price of employment , guess what happens ? you get less of it			2
why would we want to make it harder for small employers to hire people ? " there was no @entity5 minimum wage at all until the eve of @entity57 had tried to institute minimum wages , but the @entity59 repeatedly struck down those state laws			1
the @entity59 's reasoning was that a minimum wage deprived workers of the right to set the price of their own labor			1
@entity68 : the impact of a $ 9 minimum wage this sounded increasingly absurd during the @entity72			2
president @entity79 , knowing he had the nation on his side , threw down the gauntlet when he proclaimed : " all but the hopeless reactionary will agree that to conserve our primary resources of manpower , government must have some control over maximum hours , minimum wages , the evil of child labor , and the exploitation of unorganized labor			2
" a federal minimum - wage law was passed that the @entity59 did not overturn			2
and so , in 1938 , the first federal minimum wage went into effect : twenty - five cents per hour			1
as the number has increased over the decades , there have always been serious voices in agreement with @entity41 's position : that when the minimum wage is raised , businesses are able to hire and pay fewer workers , so that not only is the economy harmed , but people who want jobs have a more difficult time finding them			1
on the other side , some economists argue that the higher - minimum - wages - means - fewer - jobs theory is , in the phrase used by former secretary of labor @entity109 , " baloney			0
" @entity109 recently wrote that providing a bottom line beneath which workers ' hourly pay must not fall is the nation 's moral duty , and " a decent society should do no less			0
" the minimum wage has been a part of @entity5 life for so long now that very few citizens have any memory of a time when it did not exist			1
but the @entity5 was built by workers who were guaranteed no minimum wage -- in a country that , until the 1938 law , let the marketplace determine how much anyone was paid			1
( @entity109 's contention is that there is really no such thing as " a ' market ' that exists separate from society			0
[ @entity135 ] here 's no ' market ' in a state of nature , just survival of the fittest			0
" ) some states have their own minimum - wage standards that are higher than the federal rate ; the states are free to demand that workers earn more per hour than the federal $ 7.25 level , but may not pass laws that pay workers less			2
one of those states is @entity149 , where the current minimum wage is $ 7.79 per hour			2
i asked @entity152 , a grocery worker in @entity153 earning the minimum wage , if the increase to $ 9 would make an appreciable difference in his life			1
" there 's no question about it , " he said			0
what may seem like small change to wealthier people , he said , would allow people in his situation to be at least a little better off : " i 'd be able to buy better quality food some of the time			0
i could pay for gas and car insurance , so i could drive to my job instead of taking public transportation or riding a bicycle			0
and it would help me be able to pay my electricity and phone bills on time			0
" the federal minimum - wage law has always served a symbolic purpose beyond setting a specific number			0
it has sent a signal to even the lowest - paid workers : the country believes that what you do has value			0
the country will offer you a layer of protection that no one can undercut			0
today 's column began with one question , so let 's end it with another			0
if there had never been a minimum - wage law passed -- if , as in the years before 1938 , @entity5 today could be paid as little as employers could get away with -- and if , in 2013 , someone in @entity198 proposed the first law ever that would guarantee workers a minimum wage			1
. do you think , in our current political atmosphere , such a law would have a chance of passing ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			0

@entity208 asks : what would life in @entity5 be like if there were no minimum wage
for most of @entity5 *history* , there was no minimum wage ; it started in 1938 under @entity79
@entity25 wants to raise it . others , like @entity41 , oppose it as *costly* to business
@entity208 : with minimum wage nation tells workers : what you do has value worth protecting
