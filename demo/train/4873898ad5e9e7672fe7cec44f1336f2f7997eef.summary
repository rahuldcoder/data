@entity0 -- sexual assault incidents within the @entity5 system are not being reported up the chain , a new government audit released tuesday found			2
the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) , the investigative arm of @entity8 , reported that of nearly 300 sexual assault incidents reported to @entity11 from january 2007 through july 2010 , " many " were not reported to @entity5 leadership officials and the va inspector @entity13			1
the @entity7 report uses the term sexual assault incident to refer to " suspected , alleged , attempted , or confirmed cases of sexual assault			1
" the 284 cases of sexual assault included rape , inappropriate touching , forceful medical examinations , forced or inappropriate oral sex , and other types of sexual assault incidents			2
" when i first read this report , i was aghast , " said rep. @entity28 , chairman of the @entity29			1
" it reminded me of a 1950s prison system -- lawlessness , lack of security and reporting , and outright disregard for human dignity			0
" the @entity29 committee has scheduled a hearing on the matter for monday			1
the @entity7 says the @entity5 agreed with most of its findings			1
nearly two - thirds of the 67 rape allegations in @entity5 facilities were not reported to the va inspector general 's office , as required by @entity5 regulation , according to the report			2
both men and women were victims of the assaults			0
the victims and attackers ranged from employees to patients to those without affiliation to the @entity5			0
" not all sexual assault incidents reported to @entity11 are substantiated , " the @entity7 report said , citing reasons such as an assault did not actually take place , the victim chose not to pursue the case or there was insufficient evidence to substantiate the case			1
the investigators say underreporting is due to a lack of guidance on what constitutes a sexual assault , unclear expectations on what incidents should be reported and insufficient oversight by the @entity77 ( @entity77 ) , which oversees @entity5 health facilities			1
the @entity77 does not have a system to track and trend sexual assaults over time , according to the report , and therefore " can not identify and make changes to serious problems that jeopardize the safety of veterans in their medical facilities			2
" the report also found that the @entity5 has not taken the proper precautions to prevent sexual assaults in its medical facilities			0
among the findings : investigators report " poor monitoring of surveillance cameras , alarm system malfunctions , and the failure of alarms to alert both @entity5 police and clinical staff when triggered			1
" officials at many of the locations the @entity7 visited said the @entity11 were also understaffed			1
" patient and employee safety and security are paramount at the @entity5 , " said @entity5 press secretary @entity101			0
" we take all allegations seriously and investigate them thoroughly			0
" the @entity5 says it 's in process of reviewing the @entity7 's recommendations and taking steps to improve reporting of allegations and to provide more secure facilities			2
" the bottom line is that we have a responsibility to protect those veterans in our care , as they have protected our nation , and we will continue to strengthen our facilities to ensure that our veterans receive high - quality medical care in safe , secure facilities , " @entity101 said			0
the investigation was launched at the request of the @entity29 due to changing demographics of patients treated by the @entity5			0
the @entity5 has developed initiatives to attract specific veteran populations to use its services , including women , young veterans from @entity132 and @entity133 , and veterans facing legal issues or those already incarcerated , the report said			0
the @entity5 operates the largest integrated health care system in the country , with 153 hospitals and about 700 community - based clinics .			0
