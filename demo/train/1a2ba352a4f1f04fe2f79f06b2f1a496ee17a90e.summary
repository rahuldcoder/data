-- one is a hip - hop superstar and music mogul who dazzles audiences with his lyrical prowess , the other is a gregarious golfer who fights with the world 's best to sink balls in the fewest shots			1
their professions may be world 's apart but rapper @entity13 " @entity12 and @entity15 have more in common than first meets the eye			1
that 's because @entity12 and @entity15 -- who are both ferocious self - publicists , lovers of the high life and boast their own clothing lines -- are two examples of celebrities building business around their personalities			1
" @entity34 " may have some way to go to match the @entity12 empire -- which includes a record label , restaurants and advertising operations worth $ 475 million according to @entity31 -- but his entrepreneurial endeavour is showing promise			2
" @entity15 is a fascinating character , who 's developed his brand in a very interesting and idiosyncratic way , " said @entity35 , managing director of golf pr firm @entity36			1
for a player who is ranked 16 in the world and who has never won a major championship , the 35 year old has over a million followers on @entity46 ; a following which has led industry experts to call him golf 's " biggest brand " outside of @entity49 , who has only 750 , 000 followers			1
" [ @entity46 ] the strength of his personality is allowed to shine through , and people feel like they know him , " @entity35 added			2
@entity15 's clothing label , @entity58 , launched in 2007			1
and while it 's yet to return a profit , the residual benefits to the @entity61 's celebrity have been obvious			0
" i always wanted to have my own fashion line , " @entity15 told @entity0			2
" my mum worked in the fashion industry , and one of my first jobs was selling clothes on a market stall			0
" you definitely need to have an interest in what you wear and what looks good			0
my philosophy has always been ' look good , play great ' -- it may not matter so much to others , but it works for me			0
" @entity15 's style is not to everybody 's taste			1
at the @entity80 , he wore a pair of union jack trousers and a backwards flat cap			0
the following year his trousers were emblazoned with the tournament 's famous trophy -- the sacred @entity87			0
it was the marriage of loud clothes and strutting confidence that earned @entity15 the " peacock " tag he resents to this day , and helped make him one of golf 's most divisive personalities			1
he did n't help his cause with a rather bold claim in january 2008			0
" i have n't played to my full potential and when that happens , it will be just me and @entity49 ( @entity100 ) , " @entity15 said			2
to some it was arrogance , to others a refreshing moment of honesty			0
but , like his choice of trousers , everybody in golf was talking about it			0
" in a world where athletes are so closely managed , @entity15 brings a heart - on - the - sleeve honesty that appeals to people , " said @entity35			2
" he 's allowed to express himself , and in this internet age -- where people demand openness and honesty , he very much suits the culture			0
" it is on the internet that @entity15 is concentrating much of his marketing effort -- with the launch of a web site home for the " pro golfer , fashion designer and personality , " and a @entity46 account with 1.1 million followers			1
in golfing circles , only 2009 @entity136 @entity80 champion @entity135 has bigger numbers on @entity46 ( 1.2 million ) , while @entity13 has 3.5 million followers			1
" i love @entity46 as it allows me to give my fans an inside view to what 's going on in my world , " @entity15 said			1
" it does n't matter if its video or pictures or just 140 characters , it 's a great way to give some insight into my life			0
" it is a colorful life that @entity15 spends between @entity151 and @entity152 these days -- one that allows him to indulge his passions for football and basketball , with regular trips to watch @entity158 and the @entity159			2
and then there 's his collection of luxury cars to maintain			0
@entity15 's garage boasts a @entity164 , a @entity165 , @entity166 , an @entity167 and a @entity168 -- to name but a few			1
when you factor in time for his family -- @entity15 is married to @entity172 and has three children -- it is maybe not surprising he is regularly asked if he gives enough time to the sport that made it all possible			0
" you ca n't hit golf balls 24/7 , you need some kind of a life , " @entity15 said			2
" i have that with my other interests			0
i get 26 weeks off a year and there is enough time in a day to enjoy many interests			0
" on the course , @entity15 's most notable successes have come in the @entity186			1
three times he 's represented @entity188 in the biennial match against the @entity190 , winning eight of his 11 matches and endearing himself to millions in the process			1
the closest he came to winning a major championship was a runners - up finish in 2008 , but that has n't stopped his global brand reaching an appeal far in excess of all but one of the active players who 've managed the feat. " you only have to see the ticket sales when @entity15 plays in a tournament to see the power of his brand , " said @entity202 , of golf marketing firm @entity203			1
" from our perspective in @entity61 , the only brand bigger in golf right now is @entity49			0

golfer @entity15 turned professional in 1995 , and has won 10 @entity214 events
he 's also represented @entity188 at the @entity186 three teams , in 2004 , 2006 and 2010
in 2007 @entity15 launched his own clothing label , fulfilling a lifetime *ambition*
with over 1.1 million fans on @entity46 , he 's been labeled golf 's second biggest brand
