-- there was time , a generation ago , when it was hardly insanity -- or , to use the operative word here , @entity6 -- for the @entity8 team in @entity9 to play an unselfish style of basketball			1
it was simply called " playing the game the right way , " and the @entity13 did it better than anyone			1
fifteen years before @entity19 was born , they built their franchise on the principles their new star has brought to the team over the 12 days since the @entity25 graduate broke into the starting lineup and captivated the nation			1
do n't worry about individual statistics			0
the championship @entity13 of 1970 and 1973 had plenty of talent -- there were a combined six @entity33 on their rosters and one , head coach @entity35 , on the bench -- but they put aside their egos for the betterment of the team			1
they won as a group , not as individuals , and in the process became the pride of a struggling city in the early ' 70s			1
the stars of those teams -- @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 -- could appreciate the way the @entity13 have transformed with @entity19 as point guard			1
" what i would say to young fans is , ' close your eyes and imagine five @entity64 on a team -- that 's what those teams were like , " said @entity55 , author of the recent book " when the @entity58 was @entity59 " on those great teams			0
" @entity19 is a 21st century carryover of what the old @entity13 brought to the city			1
" now fans have to wonder : will the return to the team first style under @entity19 stick for the long term , especially with superstar @entity76 expected to return to the lineup this weekend ? and can it help end a championship drought for the @entity13 that dates back to that 1973 title ? so much about @entity19 's incredible story has focused on what he could do			1
he could knock down the stereotype that @entity85 ca n't excel at team sports , opening opportunities for countless others			0
he could become a marketing force generating tens of millions a year -- and , with his picture on the cover of @entity92 , is already on his way to becoming an international star			0
the @entity8 even added him to its all - star weekend because of the enormous interest			0
he could dramatically increase the bottom line for the big - market @entity13 , with the team 's parent company already having seen its valuation increase $ 71 million since he jumped into the starting lineup and ignited a seven - game winning streak			1
but head coach @entity105 is more focused on how his presence has dramatically changed the chemistry of a middling basketball team , turning the @entity13 from a tough - to - watch unit into something more fitting their home address just off @entity112			1
@entity92 : inside the @entity13 playbook the @entity13 are still just 15 - 15 , a long way from the elite teams in the @entity8			1
but they have been playing a pretty brand of basketball since @entity19 took the reins as point guard			1
" he 's changed everything , " @entity105 said an hour before the new - look @entity13 beat the @entity120 , 100 - 85			1
" everybody knows what they 're supposed to do and how they should act			0
nobody looks at stats and nobody cares about that			0
it 's a great feeling as a coach to have a group like that			0
" it is what every basketball coach wants : a team that is stronger than its five individual parts			2
but for years , with few exceptions , the @entity13 have put predictable , star - driven teams on the floor , living and dying on the abilities of a couple of great players rather than an entire unit			1
with @entity19 , that 's changed			2
in the win over the @entity120 , the @entity13 were a balanced and unselfish team -- the top eight players scored between nine and 15 points -- with @entity19 leading the way with a career - high 13 assists to go along with his 10 points			1
@entity19 became a national story when he torched the @entity152 for 38 points , but he said he 'd rather be a true point guard in the mold of a @entity155 or a @entity156 , one who passes first and scores when the opportunity is there			2
it 's what the @entity13 hope to get from him			2
" as a point guard , my field - goal attempts have been really high , " @entity19 said after hitting just four of six			2
" i do n't think that 's necessarily good			0
i think it 's my job to distribute and get people in a rhythm			0
" so how does @entity76 fit in ? @entity19 has won over the desperate fan base of this franchise so quickly and dramatically that the return of a superstar to the lineup has been met with worry , not excitement			2
@entity76 arrived from @entity178 in a blockbuster trade just a year ago as the player who was supposed to deliver a title to a franchise that has n't even won a playoff series since 2000			0
the small forward is a five - time all - star who led the @entity178 to the playoffs every year from 2004 - 2010 , averaging 24.8 points a game over his nine - year career			0
but he also has the reputation as a player who needs -- and demands -- the ball in his hands , one who routinely takes more than 20 shots a game			0
can he fit in with @entity19 ? he was insulted at the question			2
" that 's like a slap in the face , " @entity76 said when asked by @entity198 if he was a selfish player			0
" none of my teammates i 've ever played with would say that i was a selfish player			0
" @entity76 has a point			0
he won a national championship at @entity207 elevating his teammates and , while playing alongside @entity209 and @entity210 at the @entity211 in 2008 , took a complementary role for the benefit of the team 's gold - medal pursuit			0
he is also smart enough to have watched the @entity6 unfold in @entity216 and to know that any player who stalls this movement will not be treated kindly by the fans at @entity58			0
@entity76 insists he 'll adjust , and that the @entity13 will be a better team when he 's back			1
@entity19 , for one , is not worried			2
" he 's a lethal scorer , " @entity19 said , " and he runs the pick - and - roll so well			2
we will probably be on opposite sides on the offense and when we swing - swing the ball and set up plays off the pick - and - roll ... " he let the sentence trail off , but fans understand the potential			0
there 's no telling how far the @entity13 can go if @entity76 and his teammates are willing to put aside their egos for the betterment of the team			1
this team will captivate the city with selfless basketball			1
and , as any old school @entity13 fan can tell you , it wo n't be the first time it 's happened .			2

@entity246 says @entity19 represents " team first " style the @entity13 *exhibited* a generation ago
he says in the ' 70s , the @entity13 " put aside their egos for the betterment of the team "
@entity255 on @entity13 : " this team will captivate the city with selfless basketball "
