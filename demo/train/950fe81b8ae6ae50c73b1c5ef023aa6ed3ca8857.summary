-- major crimes usually shake us into action			1
a @entity5 fire that killed five women ultimately led to the creation of 999 , a precursor to our own 911 emergency system			1
the rape and murder of @entity12 , meanwhile , inspired the creation of the neighborhood crime watch system			1
yet while the @entity17 email breach is a different sort of crime , it is a crime nonetheless , and one that was perpetrated in a neighborhood where almost all of us are resident these days -- the @entity22			1
so where is the anger ? the letters to congressmen ? part of the reason is that the reporting has focused on celebrity feuds rather than the fact that what happened to @entity17 could happen to any of us -- emails of a personal nature allegedly being held ransom or released as payback			1
in fact , if you add up the number of victims of the most notable known breaches this year , it 's clear that a troublingly high percentage of us will have had some sort of information hacked			2
the other reason is that few of us feel like we 're paying a price for cyberbreaches -- companies that are hacked typically eat the costs , at times without even informing customers			2
but lost in the reporting is another fact : we are , in a very real sense , responsible for such attacks			1
not simply because we are the audience for the hacker 's seedy releases , but because we are the inadvertent moles that provide the hackers access to large computers networks			2
hackers often enter networks through simple phishing attacks , attacks that these days are actually simpler but more insidious than the infamous @entity69 phishing scams			2
now , instead of trying to persuade you to part with your money in exchange for a nonexistent financial windfall , emails from trusted sources ask you to check out a photograph , click on a hyperlink to an interesting story or enter your login on an official - looking webpage			2
complying with any of these requests provides varying degrees of access to your devices and accounts , and it is these simple ruses that have been responsible for launching malware and " backdoors " that have ultimately compromised major networks			2
the apparent simplicity of these attacks conceals a sophisticated understanding of people 's online behavior that is surprising even to the many academics who have spent years studying human behavior			1
the reality is that many of us fall for these scams because of our email habits			0
simple actions such as frequently checking email or @entity107 status updates have become part of the daily rituals of internet use			1
the human brain overtime automates such routines , which leads to people clicking on hyperlinks , opening attachments and providing credentials without really paying attention to what they are doing			0
smartphones and tablets have only exacerbated this			0
after all , smartphones , which the majority of us now use to access the @entity22 , are designed for media consumption , not deception detection			0
their apps are programmed to optimize smaller screen sizes and restricted data - caps , often by reducing the prominence of elements such as a website 's url or a sender 's email address that could highlight the deception			0
throw into the mix the fact that many of us are accessing these devices while talking , texting or even driving , and it 's hardly surprising that we do n't notice something nefarious			0
making things worse , even some people who suspect a deception open such emails anyway because of flawed assumptions about the security of their devices and operating systems			0
others might report the intrusion to their employer , but the reporting either comes too late or is lost in organizational silos			1
this is not surprising -- there are so many different arms of federal and state governments , along with organizations such as the @entity162 , that collect complaints and disseminate information on cyberattacks that it is hard to keep track of where to send details of a complaint , much less go through the process of finding a contact address			0
besides , there is no incentive for reporting a suspicious email unless someone has actually become a victim of an attack , in which case , it is generally already too late			1
so , what can be done ? a simpler fix would be to develop a single nationwide gateway -- an email address or a phone number similar to the 911 system -- where anyone suspicious of a cyberthreat can quickly report it			1
in addition , it would be a welcome development to see the proliferation of organizations akin to neighborhood watch groups -- cyberwatch groups , if you will -- where people can routinely report suspected attacks and receive immediate feedback			0
from @entity202 to @entity203 and the @entity69 scam , most cyberintrusions are named after the codes written into them or the hacker 's fake persona , which cedes power to the very people who perpetrate these crimes			0
instead , would n't it be better to highlight the names of the people who help detect an attack ? this would be just one way that we could encourage people to feel they are more invested in protecting our cyberinfrastructure			0
ultimately , the @entity22 is an online extension of our own neighborhoods			1
it 's time for us to take their protection just as seriously .			0

*public* should be angered over @entity17 hacking , says @entity227
@entity227 : internet is an online extension of our own neighborhoods
@entity234 should develop a single nationwide gateway for reporting hacking , he says
