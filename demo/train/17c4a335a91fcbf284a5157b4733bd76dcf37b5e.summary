-- " what we 're talking about is not an open - ended intervention			0
this would not be another @entity10 or @entity11 , " president @entity3 said this weekend in an address to the @entity6 public about a possible @entity6 military strike in @entity8			1
that the president knows he must say what the strike in @entity8 is not says a great deal about the uphill battle he has faced in making a case for limited military intervention			1
the ghosts of the @entity20 hover over any @entity8 action that the @entity6 potentially undertakes			1
but @entity10 is not @entity8			1
while @entity6 are exhausted after 12 years of wars in @entity10 and @entity11 in which nearly 7,000 @entity6 service members were killed , the differences between the two conflicts are worth noting if the case for @entity8 is to be judged on its merits			1
chemical weapons have been deployed			0
unlike @entity10 , where evidence supporting the case that @entity37 had weapons of mass destruction turned out to be faulty , @entity8 's arsenal ( in this case , chemical weapons , which are considered a form of weapons of mass destruction ) is well - documented			1
the @entity3 administration has assembled an extensive collection of evidence , both crowd - sourced and from intelligence sources , that point convincingly to president @entity46 's forces having gassed innocent civilians			0
and @entity49 investigators are scheduled to share their report soon			0
the @entity6 has not been alone in condemning the regime and pushing for action			1
unlike in 2002 when @entity56 led the vocal opposition to the @entity6 attack on @entity10 , our @entity54 ally stands next to @entity6 in supporting action against @entity8 's dictator			1
@entity62 prime minister @entity61 is also in favor of action , though @entity65 and the @entity62 public remain largely opposed			2
leaders of both countries have argued that the @entity46 regime can not be permitted to trample international norms			0
also different from a decade ago -- regional powers such as @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 have pushed for greater @entity6 intervention on the diplomatic and military fronts for months			1
without the international community stepping in , the @entity8 conflict could threaten to overrun the region			1
extremists have gained because of @entity6 inaction			2
the aftermath of @entity6 military action saw @entity10 become the flame to which extremist fighters from other countries flocked			1
extremists seized the opportunity created by the chaos and slashed the country open further , taking advantage of the upheaval to foment a conflict that pierced the heart of @entity10 's sectarian divide			1
in @entity8 , however , extremists have seized opportunities while a civil war rages			1
for months , supporters of greater @entity6 intervention in @entity8 have warned that if the @entity6 continues to stay out of @entity8 , jihadists would pile in to @entity8			1
extremist elements have gained ground with help from coffers filled by supporters in @entity106 and elsewhere			0
the number of extremists operating in @entity8 has grown in part because no credible , well - funded alternative exists			2
inaction could lead to extremists ' multiplication , not their neutralization			0
there 's a savage humanitarian crisis with no end in sight			0
before the @entity6 invasion , @entity10 was a functioning state and society , albeit one presided by a dictator who had used chemical weapons in the past and ruled with fear and terror			1
but it faced no epic humanitarian crisis			0
@entity8 today is not functioning ; it is in fragments			2
more than 100,000 people -- the population of @entity132 , @entity133 , or @entity134 , @entity135 -- have been killed in the 2Â½ - year war			0
refugees number 2 million , a staggering figure , and half of those are children			0
close to 800,000 of these displaced are under the age of 11			0
neighbors @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity143 all face the specter of instability created by the mounting numbers of refugees flooding their borders			0
@entity74 has said as much , warning that it is a strain to absorb the refugees arriving each day			0
@entity6 is skeptical after a conflict that many now feel was not worth fighting for based on premises that turned out to be untrue			2
unlike in 2002 , @entity6 is no longer ready to give its policymakers the benefit of doubt when it comes to entering battle			2
the past decade has left @entity6 exhausted , unwilling to pay another bill in treasured lives lost and dollars spent			1
@entity6 's commander in chief is aware of the reluctance			2
this is why he called for limited intervention			0
it seems that an endless war -- or even an extended one that includes ground troops -- is unlikely			0
getting into another protracted conflict in faraway lands is the last thing that @entity6 want			2
" i know that the @entity6 people are weary after a decade of war , even as the war in @entity10 has ended , and the war in @entity11 is winding down , " the president said			1
" but we are the @entity6			2
we can not turn a blind eye to images like the ones we 've seen out of @entity8			0
" as @entity181 and the @entity6 public debate just what to do in @entity8 , it is important to be clear - eyed about just what @entity8 is and what it is not			1
and it is not @entity10			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 .			0

@entity189 : president had to *explain* to the public what a @entity8 strike is not
@entity189 : past decade has left @entity6 exhausted , unwilling to enter another battle
she says intervening in @entity8 conflict would be different from going to war in @entity10
@entity189 : if @entity6 takes no action , extremism may rise and refugee crisis may worsen
