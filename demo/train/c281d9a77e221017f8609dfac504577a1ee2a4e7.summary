-- from faraway planets to the deepest depths of the ocean , 2012 has been an exciting year for scientific achievements and milestones			2
humans broke previously unimaginable barriers by detecting an elusive tiny particle and free - falling 24 miles from the edge of space			1
at the same time , we said goodbye to four retired @entity14 space shuttles that found new museum - type homes			1
here 's our list of the biggest science achievements this year , in order of significance : 1			2
curiosity lands , performs science on @entity22 every time i hear the word " curiosity " in a sentence , i 'm tempted to butt in and ask if you 're talking about the @entity22 rover curiosity			1
she 's really there ! on @entity22 ! right now ! and people are driving it ! ( forgive me , i get excited about this			1
) landing this 2 - ton rover flawlessly on the surface of @entity22 is our choice for the most exciting science moment of 2012			1
you can see from @entity14 's " seven minutes of terror " video how crazy - complicated that was -- the landing process included a supersonic parachute and a sky crane			2
i 'll never forget watching the live @entity14 feed with hundreds of other science enthusiasts at @entity48 in the first hours of august 6			1
@entity49 , assistant professor at @entity48 , who is affiliated with @entity52 's science team , was next to me , rubbing his hands together in anticipation			1
and when the landing was confirmed , the room erupted in cheers and shouts			2
this was only one of many gatherings around the world celebrating this achievement			2
and then there 's all the stuff curiosity 's been doing since then , such as taking gorgeous photos , finding shiny objects , and coming across evidence that water once flowed on @entity22			1
we ca n't wait to see what @entity52 will do in 2013			1
higgs boson -- it 's real one of the most highly anticipated discoveries in all of physics happened this year -- well , probably			2
scientists at @entity77 , the @entity77 , said they used the @entity78 to detect a particle whose characteristics matched those of the @entity73			1
what is the @entity73 , you ask ? it 's basically a component of an invisible field , called the @entity73 , that is responsible for the mass of all the matter in the universe			1
in essence , it is why we are here			2
finding this particle , sometimes referred to as the " @entity93 particle " in popular culture , will fill a large gap in scientists ' understanding about how the universe works			1
but it 's not " @entity93 " in the way that you might think			2
@entity103 - winning physicist @entity102 wrote a book with " @entity73 " in the title , but reportedly said he 'd actually wanted to call it the " @entity107			1
" but wait , what about its mass ? the two most precise ways that the particle has been measured have yielded slightly different values for its mass , said @entity115 , scientist with the @entity117 experiment at the @entity78			1
but these measurements are consistent , and with more data that difference should get smaller			2
" it all points at the moment to that this is indeed the @entity73 , " she said in an e-mail			1
more results are expected in march 2013 , she said			1
@entity130 's deep dive he did n't find @entity132 necklace , but director @entity130 did probe the remotest depths of the ocean this year			0
in fact , using his one - man submersible , the maker of " titanic " and " @entity138 " traveled to the deepest known point in the world 's oceans			0
@entity130 is the first to go alone to @entity143 , the name for that part of the @entity146 in the western @entity147			0
here 's a mind - boggling fact : @entity146 is deeper than @entity150 is tall			0
only two other humans have ever visited it			0
in this cold , dark place , miles beneath the ocean 's surface , @entity130 said he did not see any fish , but did spot some " shrimplike animals			1
" it took him 2 hours , 36 minutes , to get down there			0
" it 's a completely alien world , " @entity130 said			0
@entity162 's record - breaking jump @entity163 daredevil @entity162 broke the speed of sound in october by jumping from the edge of space			1
he got up there on a balloon , then stepped off a platform 24 miles high and landed soon after in the @entity171 desert			1
@entity162 wore a 100 - pound pressurized flight suit and helmet			0
without protection , his blood would have been vaporized because the atmosphere was so thin when he jumped			0
the temperature at his launch point was estimated at 70 degrees below zero @entity179 , if not lower			0
in doing so , @entity162 broke the record for highest jump that had been set in 1960 by col. @entity182			0
as part of a @entity186 @entity185 mission , @entity182 fell from 102,800 feet			0
he was a consultant for @entity162 's efforts			0
technology behind how he did it 5			0
planet with four suns you may recall a scene from " @entity193 " where @entity194 looks out across the landscape of a planet called @entity197 , which had two suns			1
this year , amateur scientists discovered that in reality , there is a planet with not just two , but four , suns			1
this planet , called @entity205 , is special for another reason : it 's the first confirmed planet that the @entity209 group has identified			1
@entity209 is a citizen science organization , made of people just like you , who are combing through planet data			1
the group has also helped identify several planet candidates			1
nearby star has a planet the closest planet we know of to @entity219 , outside of our solar system , was identified in october			1
this planet orbits a star called @entity223 it 's unlikely to harbor life , but there 's hope that other potential planets in that area might be more hospitable to breathing creatures			1
of course , when we say " close , " we mean 4 light - years , or 23.5 trillion miles , away			0
about 800 planets have been confirmed to exist outside our solar system , in addition to nearly 2,000 planet candidates found with the @entity234 mission			1
@entity235 becomes a ' protoplanet ' @entity14 's @entity237 helped scientists to determine that @entity235 , originally thought of as an asteroid , is a " protoplanet			1
" that means that its structure has a dense , layered body , and it orbits the sun. what 's the difference between a protoplanet and a planet ? it appears that something interrupted the development of protoplanets , which are n't fully formed , so they do n't quite make the cut as full - fledged planets			1
bye - bye , space shuttles in 2011 , we said goodbye to @entity14 's @entity260			1
this year , we saw the four surviving orbiters making @entity263 journeys -- whether flown or towed -- to new homes at museums and similar attractions			2
@entity267 is at the @entity268 at the @entity270 's @entity269 in @entity271 , @entity272			0
it flew on the back of a 747 from @entity275			0
this is the most traveled of the space shuttles			1
enterprise is at the @entity279 in @entity280			0
this shuttle never actually went into space , but it was carried on a 747 jet from @entity284 to @entity280 in june			2
it was originally designed as a prototype test vehicle			0
endeavour is at the @entity288 in @entity289 , having flown from @entity275 on the back of a 747			0
to make room for it to be towed through the city , dozens of trees were cut down and traffic signs removed			0
@entity295 is at the @entity275 in @entity296 , @entity297			0
it was the last space shuttle to go to space , and the last to come to rest this year			2
unlike the other shuttles , which made flyovers in various parts of the @entity186 , @entity295 moved only 10 miles , towed by land to the @entity304 in november			2
the other two shuttles -- @entity306 and @entity307 -- did not make it back to @entity219 after accidents that killed their entire crews			2
@entity311 gets to the space station , and back no @entity14 shuttles flew in 2012 , but a private company called @entity311 successfully sent almost 900 pounds of cargo to the international space station in its first official mission in october			1
the dragon capsule came back with nearly 1,700 pounds of freight			0
this was only months after the @entity311 demonstration flight in may			0
@entity14 and @entity311 have a contract for a dozen flights to the space station , and the october trip was just the first			2
@entity311 is n't the only player in this commercial spaceflight arena			0
@entity328 , sir @entity329 's private spaceflight company , recently completed a high - altitude test			0
@entity331 is also under contract with @entity14 , and will also launch a demonstration flight			0
@entity334 constructed before birth for the first time , researchers at the @entity337 were able to construct a near - total genome sequence of a fetus , using a blood sample from the mother and saliva from the father			0
the study suggested this method could be used to detect thousands of genetic diseases in children while they are still in the fetal stage			0
in the long run , it could help scientists derive new insights about genetic diseases			2
right now , this sequencing costs in the neighborhood of $ 50,000 , but given how rapidly the price of genetic testing is falling , the process may become less expensive over time			0
of course , it also raises ethical issues about selecting certain desirable traits in children			0
for right now , however , the technology is still in its early stages			0
