-- air guitar players , bus stop drummers and office desk virtuosos , rejoice : being a slave to the rhythm has just become a lot more fun			2
@entity8 is a new technology that turns any object into a musical instrument , by converting the vibrations you make when you touch it into sound			1
here 's how it works : you stick a small sensor to the surface you want to play with , be it a tree or a fruit bowl or your bathtub , and then connect it to your smartphone			1
an app running on it detects and analyzes the vibrations , transforming them into musical notes			1
the sound can then be amplified by hooking up the smartphone to headphones or speakers			2
" the sound you hear is really coming from the object , it 's not a virtual reconstruction , " says @entity33 , the 30 - year - old music technology researcher who invented the device			1
" it 's a principle called physically inspired sound system			2
when you play a real instrument , like a guitar , the sound is created by the combination of an exciter and a resonator			1
the exciter is the plectrum in your hand that hits the strings , and the resonator is the combination of the strings and the body of the guitar			0
@entity8 works in a similar way : everything that is picked up by the sensor -- your gestures , the object itself -- is the exciter , and the resonator is emulated through the software			1
we just modify the signal to respect musical rules			1
" the name of the device is a geeky reference to its functionality : it stands for " @entity73			0
" nothing is random : if you make the same gesture twice , you get the same sound			0
through the app , you can select the musical notes and timbres that you want it to associate to your gestures			1
sounds complicated ? " @entity8 is designed to be immediately pleasant and fun to play for anyone , " @entity33 told @entity0 , " but at the same time it leaves room for improvement and virtuosity			1
" the default setting for the system is the " free mode " : you select a musical scale and the frequency of the vibrations that you create is mapped to one specific note on that scale			1
alternatively , you can use " @entity97 " , which entails uploading a song in the form of a midi file onto your phone : each time you touch your designated object , you play a note from your song			1
mogees had a successful @entity106 earlier this year , and subsequently secured additional private funding to the tune of Â £ 1 million			1
the first units have already been delivered to backers			1
and @entity33 has racked up some field tests with pre-production prototypes : " in @entity113 i met a sword swallower who stuck it on top of his sword and proceeded to play it with the piercing on his tongue : it produced a really high frequency , eerie sound			0
a @entity126 researcher emailed me saying he was going to the @entity128 forest for a month and wanted a couple of @entity8 to show to the local tribes			1
dancers play it with their feet			0
and i 've seen people just attach it to a ping pong table to ' sonify ' their game			0
" a musical enthusiast himself -- he pauses mid-sentence to marvel at the sound of a nearby @entity105 playing a song by @entity143 , the @entity145 pioneers of electronic music -- @entity33 has performed publicly several times with the device , most recently playing alongside @entity151 electronic duo @entity149 at @entity153 's @entity152 , a venue that has hosted the likes of @entity156 and @entity157			2
on stage , he had surrounded himself with items reminiscent of a playground : a slide , a tree , a metal fence , and some scaffolding arranged to spell the word " play "			0
at one point he used a wooden chair , gently caressing it as if trying to convince it to produce the perfect note			0
" i 'm trying to add some visual and performative aspect to electronic music			0
i want it to go back to the real world and be physically performed , with the advantages of digital technology coupled with the gestures of acoustic instruments			2
we 're witnessing a spring of augmented reality and embedded technology , and this concept can be applied to music as well : i wish to inspire people to see objects in a novel way			2
" other musicians are using or plan to use the device			0
among them , @entity126 electronic composer @entity189 , the @entity191 acoustic duo @entity190 , and @entity193 songwriter @entity192			0
but @entity33 is also eager to see how regular users will employ it , and he plans to update the software accordingly , while keeping an open stance : " this project is about not telling people what to do , " he says , " there are no rules with this technology			2
i want people to just look around and find their own inspiration			0
all i 'm going to do is try to make their experience better			0
