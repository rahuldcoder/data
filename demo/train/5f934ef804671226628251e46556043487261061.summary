-- in " the @entity4 , " @entity3 troops invade a foreign country where oil interests are at stake , a rising foreign power is looking to derail @entity3 forces using cloak and dagger tactics , and there 's a gunfight in the desert against insurgent enemies			1
@entity16 © @entity15 vu , anyone ? as contemporary as this story sounds , it does n't take place in the @entity21 , and it 's not set in modern times			1
the latest novel from @entity25 - winning author @entity24 uses the battle of @entity27 and the @entity3 invasion of @entity29 during that country 's civil war in 1914 as its backdrop			1
@entity33 takes an often - overlooked chapter of history and turns it into a whip - smart tale of intrigue and espionage			1
at the center of this swashbuckling thriller is @entity41 , an @entity3 newspaper war correspondent , better known as " kit			1
" covering the war in enemy territory , he 's nearly shot by a mysterious sniper , joins forces with a double agent , is almost killed by a @entity49 army officer and falls in love with a headstrong young @entity29 woman who may be mixed up in the revolutionary plot			1
you do n't need to be an expert on the era to enjoy the story , but history buffs will appreciate cameos from real - life characters like @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62			1
@entity24 recently spoke with @entity0 about his new novel			1
the following is an edited transcript			2
@entity0 : what was the spark behind your new novel ? @entity33 : it began with a postcard			1
i did a book back in 2004 called " had a @entity74 , " which was a book of short stories i wrote based on my picture postcard collection			1
i collect them not so much for the images on the front but the messages written on the back			2
although this particular postcard had a terrific image			1
i describe it in the short story , and that became the beginning of " the @entity4			2
" it was a photo of a man walking on the street			2
you see him from behind			2
he 's passing a row of adobe shops with @entity97 names			1
way in the distance on the cobblestone street , you see a man on horseback			2
if you study his profile , you see it 's an @entity107 of the era			1
in the mid-distance , a gaggle of people , mostly women			2
the postcard author has drawn an arrow to point at one of the women , and on the back he 's written , " after the battle			1
notice the pretty @entity118 in this photo			2
the one in white does my laundry			2
" what he does not mention is , not more than an arm 's length away are two dead men lying on the sidewalk in pools of blood			1
from all of this , i deduced this was the @entity133 in 1914 @entity29			2
after that , this voice would n't let go of me			2
@entity0 : you 're a bit of a chameleon as a writer ; no two novels are the same			2
what led you to write a historical thriller ? @entity33 : i 've always loved the genre , but i just follow where the muse leads me			1
in this day and age of terrorists operating covertly and wreaking havoc , governments rising and falling from populist revolutions , mass murders in movie theaters and high seas piracy , this is an intense age			2
all of which is given to us in these tense , brief , highly dramatic outbursts in the various news media			0
if you 're responding to this world around us , for me , the thriller , especially the espionage thriller , seems absolutely the right choice			1
@entity0 : what inspired your main character in this novel , @entity166 ? @entity33 : biological improbabilities aside , if @entity168 and @entity169 had a bastard son , it would be @entity172			1
honestly , this character is very close to me			0
i was in military intelligence in @entity177			0
i was a reporter and then an editor in chief of an investigative business newspaper for a decade			0
i grew up in a theatrical family and trained as an actor			0
i 'm relating major elements of who @entity41 is , and the stories he has to tell about himself are reflective of how i see the world right now			0
i 'm thinking of this book as part one of a six - or eight - or 10 - or 12 - part novel			0
he 's a complex guy , and he 's evolving as the series goes on			1
@entity0 : you wrote several of your early novels while a commuter in @entity195			0
how did that experience impact you as a writer ? @entity33 : that was during my journalist era			0
i lived in @entity200 , @entity201			0
i rode the @entity202 into @entity203 , where i worked			0
my life circumstances were such that if i wanted to be a novelist , i was going to have to do it on the train			0
this was before laptop computers , so i had a drafting pencil , a legal pad and a @entity213 lap board , and amidst all the chaos , i wrote 300 polished words on the train going into @entity195 in the morning and 300 polished words on the train going home at night			0
you have to write every day to be a real novelist , and there 's no excuse not to			1
i was at an absolute crossroads			0
either i 'm going to do this under the most difficult circumstances , and i 'm going to do it every day of my life , or i wo n't do it			0
it represented my fundamental choice to be a writer			0
@entity0 : what drives you to keep writing ? @entity33 : i have no choice but to do it			0
it 's these voices inside me			1
i 'm known for doing first - person voices			0
this book is in @entity172 's voice			1
i wrote several books of very short stories , and in the space of a couple of years i wrote in the voices of 163 different people , including an animal or two			0
those voices are there in my artistic unconscious and ask to be heard , and i channel them			0
@entity0 : what 's the most difficult part of your job ? @entity33 : self - discipline is one of the things			1
if you write from your unconscious , your white - hot center , then the place you go into is scary as hell			0
as the great @entity264 film director @entity263 said , to be an artist means to never avert your eyes			0
the whole process is multifaceted and a big monolithic challenge			0
you have to do it every day , and you ca n't look away			0
@entity0 : what 's next for you and @entity172 ? @entity33 : i just finished the second book in the series , " @entity273 of @entity274 , " which will come out next fall			1
it opens on the @entity276 in may of 1915 , and we 'll move on to @entity278 and then @entity274			0
there 's a beautiful silent film star who 's a person of interest in this book			1
there 's a lot of derring - do , surprises and revelations			1
read an excerpt from " the @entity4			0
" like @entity290 on @entity291			0
