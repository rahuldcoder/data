a decreasing number of @entity2 gun owners own two - thirds of the nation 's guns and as many as one - third of the guns on the planet -- even though they account for less than 1 % of the world 's population , according to a @entity12 analysis of gun ownership data			1
the data , collected by the @entity15 , the @entity16 , the @entity17 and population figures from the @entity19 , found that the number of @entity2 households with guns has declined , but current gun owners are gathering more guns			1
the @entity2 tends to have better data on gun numbers than other countries , for instance @entity28 or the @entity30 , which may account for the high percentage , according to @entity33 , dean and professor at the @entity35 at @entity36			2
gun owners debate in wake of @entity40 tragedy however , within its own borders , the @entity2 gun owning population is on the decline and those gun owners are stockpiling more firearms			1
" those who own guns , own more guns , " said @entity47 , the executive director and founder of the @entity49 , a @entity51 - based gun control advocacy group			2
last year the organization released an analysis of figures from the @entity17 , which found that both the number of households owning guns and the number of people owning guns were decreasing			2
politicians from both parties have tip - toed around gun control after the @entity40 , @entity68 , movie theater massacre to avoid political implications in the upcoming election			2
however , studies suggest they are bowing to a smaller number of @entity2 gun owners			1
those gun owners tend to live in swing states , explained @entity33			1
" you can see where [ the gun debate plays out ] in the presidential election , " said @entity33			0
" where rural states are swing states and urban states are not			1
" candidates show little appetite for new gun control laws a study published in the @entity15 , based on a 2004 @entity86 , found that 20 % of the gun owners with the most firearms possessed about 65 % of the nation 's guns			1
a 2007 survey by the @entity92 's @entity16 found that the @entity2 , which has 5 % of the world 's population , owns 50 % of the world 's guns			2
the number of households owning guns has declined from almost 50 % in 1973 to just over 32 % in 2010 , according to a 2011 study produced by @entity102 's @entity101			2
the number of gun owners has gone down almost 10 % over the same period , the report found the concentration comes , in part , because guns are " marketed by and large to people who already own guns , " @entity33 said			1
he also said that guns are specialty items , like tools in a tool box , so those who own guns are more likely to buy additional guns for different hunting purposes , for instance			0
" if you use a 12 - gauge shotgun to shoot a rabbit , the rabbit wo n't exist after you shoot it , " @entity33 said			0
therefore a gun owner who is a hunter will use a different gun for different types of hunting , for instance a small - caliber rifle instead of a high - powered shotgun			0
both studies also found that men were more likely to own guns , though the @entity17 found that male gun ownership is down almost 20 % since 1980			0
the @entity49 's analysis of the general social survey data also found that part of the reason the gun owning population is declining is because those weapons are largely owned by white males , a group whose population is aging			0
one in 10 women own a gun , the @entity17 found			0
opinion : do guns make us safer ? still , while it is possible to collect accurate data on the number of guns in the @entity2 using manufacturing , import - export and life - cycle data for the guns , the federal government has little idea of who the guns owners are , gun policy experts said			1
" the federal government does n't have good data on anything on guns and that 's been done on purpose , " said @entity164 , director of the @entity165 and senior author of the @entity15 study			0
" the gun lobby has lots of power ... [ their ] goal is not to have any sort of registration system			0
" " we asked , ' where 'd the guns go ? ' the answer -- it looked like the people that had lots of guns were buying more guns , " @entity164 said			0
the false perception that there are more gun owners has helped bolster a political narrative , emboldened the @entity195 and left politicians worried about losing support , gun policy experts say			1
" ... it gives them more power to say they are representing more gun owners and there are more gun owners , " said @entity164			1
" there is a myth pushed by the gun industry , the @entity195 and the trade associations for gun makers that gun ownership is up , " he said			0
" [ that ] there are more gun owners , when the opposite is true , gun ownership is declining			1
" the @entity195 did not respond to repeated requests from @entity12 for comment			0
opinion : @entity219 drives opposition to gun control			0

the number of @entity2 gun owners has declined as more guns are concentrated in fewer hands
@entity12 analysis shows gun owners in the @entity2 own one - third of guns on the planet
many gun owners live in swing states , *key* to the fall election
