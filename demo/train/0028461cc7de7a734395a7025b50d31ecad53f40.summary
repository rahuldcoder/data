-- a fireplace is n't just a spot to keep logs and kindling			1
according to decorators and design enthusiasts , it 's where you put your heart on display			1
of course , in decorator speak , a fireplace serves as a design focal point , something you can use as a jumping - off point for furniture placement and accessories			1
it adds " charm " to any room			1
but in practical terms , what you choose to display on a mantel is something that will be seen -- and seen as important			2
often coveted as a must - have detail for home buyers , fireplaces -- and mantels in particular -- evoke a specific feeling of tradition and comfort , decorator @entity27 said			1
" i think they represent the coziness and warmth that we envision when we think of what ' home ' should be , " she said			2
it does n't matter whether the fireplace is regularly used , she said , noting that the climate around her @entity45 home does n't always provide the opportunity for a roaring fire			2
@entity48 of @entity49 by @entity50 said the time her family spends around their fireplace makes the cold , snowy days in @entity55 easier to bear			2
when hurricanes and recent record - breaking snowstorms caused power outages , their fireplace delivered			2
" there is something so cozy about sitting by the fireplace and enjoying the moment , " she said			2
but what if it 's not cold ? there 's little reason to use a fireplace in the middle of a sweltering summer , but that wo n't stop decorators from giving their mantels the summertime treatment			1
many decorators who contributed to this week 's @entity49 assignment confessed to switching out their mantel decor often , at least once per season			1
@entity49 : no matchy - matchy in the bedroom , please light , bright and simple are the go - to decor philosophies for summer mantels			1
fresh garden clippings in simple containers , seashells , driftwood , outdoor lanterns and cool shades of green and blue help keep the mind on beach vacations and lazy days			2
thoughts of home " there is absolutely something nostalgic and magical about a fireplace , " said @entity94 to radiance blogger @entity95			2
" while they are n't exactly a necessary thing to have these days , they represent a time period and a way of life where things were a little slower and more traditional			2
" she and her husband love their fireplace so much that they stared a @entity112 tradition of pulling a mattress into the living room and sleeping nearby on @entity115			1
sometimes , as in @entity119 's case , the memories associated with mantels are more literal			1
" to me , a fireplace is a symbol of my childhood in @entity123 , " she said			2
" my family still has the same very traditional wood - burning fireplace from when i was growing up			2
it has a beautiful heavy stone mantel and is surrounded by a huge built - in library wall			0
" we spent every winter and holiday around that fireplace , " @entity119 said			1
" while people in other homes used to put their family photos and knickknacks on their mantels , my mother never decorated like that			1
my mother always kept it simple and only displayed a few pieces of her inherited silver			0
" and that 's a tradition @entity119 carries on , as seen on her blog @entity145			0
there 's just something special about fireplaces , @entity146 of @entity147 said			0
aside from hanging stockings from the mantle during the winter holidays and lighting fires in the box for cold weather ambiance , " we take all of our big family photos in front of ours , " she said			1
@entity49 : steps to a decorated staircase application of tchotchkes for decorating purposes , a mantel is essentially a shelf			1
but it 's not usually very deep , and there 's no right or wrong way to decorate it			0
and that can stymie the best - laid decorating plans			0
although mounting a flat - screen television above a fireplace is one modern solution to the " focal point " part of the decorating equation , it 's also the part of a room where modern decorators feel comfortable about " breaking the rules , " said @entity184 of @entity185			1
memories of mantels cluttered with formal portraits , holiday cards and the urns of loved ones have given way to the idea of a mantel being a piece of art , she said : " i love that people are reclaiming it and making it their own			1
" " a mantel is a great way to showcase what is meaningful and beautiful to you , " said @entity200 , the owner of @entity201 on the update			0
" people are using mantels as more of a showpiece now			1
before , it was just a shelf to set things on			0
" " they also tell a story , " @entity48 said			1
" you can easily change your decorations out for every season and display things that you really love			0
it could be as simple as one or two things or as many as you want			0
" @entity49 : are you brave enough to decorate boldly in the foyer ? stories large and small as staircase pictures walls and gallery - style picture hanging continue to gain popularity , the mantel is now the place for decorative items			1
" scale is an important challenge when decorating a mantel , " @entity48 said			0
" finding that perfect big item may take some time			0
an oil painting , a mirror or just an interesting empty antique frame are all good options			0
" smaller items resting on the mantel help balance out the bigger items			0
but sometimes those smaller items get tricky , said @entity242 of @entity243			0
her home has a double - sided fireplace , with one side facing the living room and the other her bedroom			1
" the biggest challenge for me is trying to edit the items on the mantel , " she said			0
" sometimes i can go overboard and find too many things i want to stick on it , ( and they ) do n't necessarily go together			0
" @entity184 sticks to arranging items in groups of odd numbers , making sure the items share a similar color or shape			1
" i think the biggest challenge is knowing how much is enough , " she said			0
" be sure to include some negative , or empty , space to make it more pleasing to the eye			0
" or , you can run with that space , like @entity264 of @entity265 does			0
" nothing is wrong with a very simple mantel , so if you do n't think you got it right , keep it sparse , " she said			0
" ( it 's ) a much better choice than adding clutter			0
