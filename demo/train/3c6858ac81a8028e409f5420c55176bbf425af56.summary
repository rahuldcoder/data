@entity0 -- @entity2 arrived at @entity0 's @entity4 cemetery on a humid morning , armed with a rake and gloves to clear fallen branches and decaying leaves from her ancestors ' graves			1
" i 've got my great - grandparents on this side ... and my grand - uncle will be on this side , " she said , pointing in opposite directions			0
an eight - lane highway , set for construction in 2013 , will run though the middle of the cemetery			0
to make way for it , a swathe of graves -- marked by wooden stakes with painted numbers -- is being exhumed			2

the highway is expected to be completed by 2016 and affect 3,746 graves , according to @entity0 's @entity32			1
afterwards , what remains of the cemetery area will make way for 15,000 new housing units and two mass transit stations , and all the graves -- including those of @entity2 's family -- will be exhumed under the plan			1
with an estimated 100,000 graves , @entity4 is the largest @entity44 cemetery outside @entity44 , according to @entity0 's @entity45			1
located near a cluster of reservoirs at the center of the island , the cemetery sprawls over several hills covered partly in rainforest jungle			0
closed to new burials since the early 1970 's , @entity4 now stands at the heart of a heated debate over development in tiny @entity0 -- a nation that went from new and underdeveloped to one of the world 's most prosperous in a matter of decades			1
in addition to pioneers and early migrants like @entity2 's family , the cemetery holds the remains of @entity0 's most prominent , like @entity66 , the grandfather of @entity67 , the founder of modern @entity0			1
the government says the road is needed to reduce traffic congestion , pointing out that a country of just 714 square kilometers ( 275 square miles ) has many more needs , including land for housing , defense , industry and utilities			0
" in such a highly land - constrained setting , we need to make difficult decisions on land use for present and future generations of @entity0 , " a spokesman for the @entity32 said			2

it 's not just about hanging out in shopping malls here , " she asserts			0
the @entity32 says it does n't take the decision " lightly " and is working with community members to come up with ways to preserve the heritage of @entity4			0
