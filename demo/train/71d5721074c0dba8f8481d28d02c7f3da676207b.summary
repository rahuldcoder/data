-- it 's about that time of year , when dyed green rivers and @entity4 beers flow , the shamrock sunglasses and leprechaun t - shirts come out , and corned beef and cabbage enters the mainstream menu			1

with @entity18 week away , the @entity13 across @entity16 -- and those who just want to be @entity13 for a day -- are preparing to celebrate , if they have n't started already			1
when it comes to @entity21 's , many people think of the annual parades			0
the @entity16 invention originated in @entity24 , which still has the largest , but the green season is about so much more			1
for hundreds of years in @entity27 , people have observed the feast of @entity18 , a fifth - century missionary credited with saving pagans on the @entity27			1
on the feast day of march 17 , which falls during the @entity34 season , the @entity13 can cut loose : sing , dance and enjoy meat , even on a friday , when it would otherwise be prohibited			2
@entity13 , who account for more than 12 percent of the @entity16 population according to the @entity40 , mark @entity14 and celebrate their heritage in numerous ways that may go unnoticed to the casual observer or outsider			1

political wit a hit in @entity51 , @entity52 the link to @entity27 could n't be stronger than it is in @entity52 , where a quarter of the population claims @entity13 heritage			1
and while the state capital is awash in green cheer at this time of year , a tradition of exchanging political barbs has kicked off each morning of the @entity14 , dating back about 60 years			2
the march 15 breakfast , including song and dance amid the playful ribbing , was an outgrowth of the community 's involvement in politics , which runs as deep as @entity13 humor			2
" it allows people to see their elected officials [ local , state and national ] in a role they do n't normally see them in , " explained state sen. @entity73 ( or , as he says it , " @entity76 " ) of south @entity51 , who 's hosting the political roast for the eighth year			2
the televised event draws about 4 million viewers and " beats the sunday morning talk shows			0
" neither sen. @entity83 nor sen. @entity84 is expected this year , but getting a call from the nation 's highest office is n't unheard of			2
vice president @entity88 has attended , and @entity73 said they 're working on getting the attention of president @entity91			1
or is that @entity92 ? honoring their ancestors in @entity95 , @entity96 they may not match the @entity13 population numbers of @entity51 , @entity24 or @entity98 , but several @entity100 cities , including @entity95 , @entity96 , have deep green roots			1
the city 's annual parade , which dates back 185 years , draws about 400,000 and is reportedly the second largest in the country , according to the parade committee web site			0
behind the public fanfare , however , there 's a lower - key event that @entity110 , the parade committee chairman , touts as more important to the southern city 's @entity112 : the @entity114 and ceremony			0
the sunday event , on march 15 this year , starts at 11:45 a.m. in the @entity117 , where members of all the @entity13 societies come together to pray before walking in procession to the @entity114 ( made of stone from @entity27 ) in @entity122			1
" that 's just a big day for us , " @entity110 said			0
away from all the commercialism , " to us , it 's in honor of our ancestors			0
" kicking up their feet in @entity98 , @entity131 the night before @entity134 see their river turn an emerald green , an annual dyeing practice that dates back 40 years , the @entity13 community and other observers will gather for one of its newer traditions : @entity140			1

it begins at 7 p.m. march 13			0
step dancing , a tradition popularized by 1994 's " riverdance " show , involves rapid foot work while keeping the upper body stiff			1
it 's also a platform for traditional @entity13 music and costumes			1
for parents who usually spend time carting their children around , the event offers them a chance to " finally get to see their kids perform ... showcasing the styles they have , " said @entity165 , a spokeswoman for the @entity166 , which hosts the weekend 's kickoff event			0
" it 's important to carry on heritage , " she said			0
a taste of tradition in @entity15 , @entity172 during @entity174 in @entity15 , which features everything from a genealogy conference and run to street painting and the passing of a shillelagh ( an @entity13 walking stick ) , one particular event rose to our attention			2
the decades - old @entity13 soda bread baking contest , which happened saturday , attracts more than 100 competitors each year			1
the bread dates back to about 1840 , traditionally features a cross on top " to ward off evil " and uses bicarbonate of soda -- instead of yeast -- for rising , said @entity191 , a spokesman for @entity15 's @entity192			0
" it was simple to make , the ingredients were easy to find , and it was very filling , " said @entity193 , who oversees the contest and grew up on her mom 's soda bread			0
it was a staple in @entity13 homes " up until 40 years ago , " she continued			2
" and it 's a tradition we like to keep alive			0

looking around during their first @entity14 parade in the @entity216 , she said , " i remembered thinking , ' this is it ?

this year 's parade starts at 10 a.m. saturday and is followed by festivities in the park adjacent to the cultural center			0
" we will naturally have liquid libations , " @entity209 said			0
" you ca n't have an @entity13 party without liquid libations			2
" but it 's not all about drunken revelry			0
their center 's groundbreaking in 1999 began by dedicating a memorial to the " @entity239 , " or the mid- 19th century potato famine that led to death , disease and mass emigration , @entity209 said			0
