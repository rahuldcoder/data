-- put @entity4 's @entity2 and @entity3 , drummer @entity1 , the @entity5 ' flea and percussionist @entity6 into a studio for three days , and you know the sound coming out of that session is going to be otherworldly			1
the musicians seem to have created exactly that as the band , @entity12 , is edging closer to the release of its debut album , " amok , " early next year			1
the move toward an album was an organic one , @entity2 explains in an interview in @entity22			1
the @entity4 singer - songwriter initially booked studio time for the group -- which was banded together to perform live songs from his 2006 album , " @entity28 " -- because of how great they sounded during rehearsal for the string of eight concerts held in 2010			1
they went into their recording session with nothing , @entity2 says , and ended up coming out " with a f * * * * * g mountain			1
" @entity2 and @entity3 then edited that mountain , combining it with other laptop and studio work they 'd done until it turned into a nine - track album			1
@entity2 and @entity3 agree that their intent on " amok " was to " step into the unknown , " as @entity3 put it			1
" one of the things we were most excited about , " @entity2 added , " was ending up with a record where you were n't quite sure where the human starts and the machine ends			2
" the method to creating that kind of ambiguity was its own " form of madness , " @entity2 recalled			2
" we 'd go in at midday and pretty much work through to 10			0
we were playing all the time			0
we 'd stop to change beat			0
@entity1 and @entity6 would scribe the beat out , using whatever weird notation they have , and then go off on it for another hour			0
" @entity2 's role in the process was more of a conductor , he said , as he and @entity3 would pipe up with approval or disapproval of the sound 's direction			1
" it was about trying to get interesting grooves , " @entity2 said			2
" when we first hung out , we were at @entity1 's house			2
we got wasted , played pool and listened to @entity76 all night			0
it was that idea of trance - ing out			0
but there are still songs here			0
" although he 's tempted not to , @entity2 could n't help but remark that he " really want ( s ) to say , ' this is the beginning of something			2
' " besides , " this was after three days in that studio			0
@entity86 help us if we 'd had a week			0
" will @entity12 head out on tour again after " amok " drops ? " i hope so , " @entity2 said			1
" we all want to			0

@entity2 's group , @entity12 , has an album arriving early next year
the music was born out of a three - day studio session
@entity4 's @entity3 says the album steps " into the unknown "
@entity12 wants to tour again after the album 's release
