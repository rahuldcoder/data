near @entity0 , @entity1 -- in the wake of @entity6 's invasion of @entity7 , the mood here tuesday was tense , but the streets appeared eerily calm			1
@entity1 's @entity7 region has become the flashpoint in a geopolitical crisis that has embroiled @entity12 , @entity13 , the @entity14 and @entity15			1
in the days since they crossed the border into this strategically important peninsula on the @entity19 , @entity6 forces have surrounded 10 @entity1 military bases -- 16,000 troops in the past week , according to @entity1 officials			1
there has been no fighting -- or loss of life -- but there were ample signs of preparation			0
the situation in @entity0 , @entity7 's regional capital , is almost surreal			1
rumor , confusion and outlandish claims mix freely -- and reality is difficult to pin down			1
on the surface , the capital seems undisturbed			0
shops are open , people sit in cafes , the buses and trams are running normally			0
and then there are pockets -- especially around the parliament and other @entity7 government buildings -- where the discord hangs in the air			2
these places have moved firmly into the @entity49 camp , where the @entity6 and @entity7 flags are flying and the yellow - and - blue flag of @entity1 is not			1
knots of men , most of them burly , middle - aged and chain - smoking , gather outside the buildings recently taken over by @entity49 parties			0
they say they are defending the rights of @entity6 in a country led by people they see as ultranationalist @entity1			1
they say they relish the prospect of a referendum this month that could see @entity7 " decoupled " from @entity1			1
on the streets appears a truckload of men in uniform , not @entity1 , for sure , but not identifiably @entity6			1
they are close to @entity1 military compounds , where troops remain inside , largely out of sight			2
similar standoffs are playing out around barracks and bases in far - flung corners of @entity7			2
here , there has been no violence			0
instead , the hint of camaraderie among fellow soldiers can be discerned			0
people anxiously await what comes next but among @entity1 and @entity88 , a predominantly @entity89 group , living here , there is a sense of foreboding , one that most of them are reluctant to express			2
there are no @entity96 demonstrations , perhaps for fear of the consequences			0
and so people go on living their lives as best they can , waiting anxiously for what comes next			0
on tuesday , about 12 miles ( 20 kilometers ) southeast of @entity0 , about 100 @entity6 soldiers at a @entity1 military base were digging in against a backdrop of rolling hills			1
they parked their troop - moving vehicles , excavated a series of mini trenches in the dirt and erected mess tents			0
apparently oblivious to the international tensions over @entity6 's moves , they were carrying on civil conversations with @entity1 soldiers and moving about freely			1
it all appeared fairly friendly			0
the @entity6 soldiers treated their presence as nothing special , even as it made nearby residents uncomfortable			2
a supporter of the @entity1 forces had driven all the way from @entity125 to offer food			1
" i 'm @entity6 and i want to say i do n't need any protection from any brother nation or anyone else on my land			2
we will solve our problems through talks not fights , " the man told @entity2			1
blocking food deliveries at the gate was a pro-russian " self - defense " group , which hopes a referendum will split @entity7 from @entity1			1
" it will mean either we have full autonomy or we disconnect from @entity1 and join fully with @entity6			1
that can only be positive , " said @entity143 , a member of the group			0
much of the tension here stems from generations of heritage and tradition			0
ethnic @entity6 have lived in @entity7 for centuries , and many of the current generation look upon @entity155 's forces as friendly protectors			1
that view may not be shared by many of those @entity7 residents with @entity1 roots			1
this unease manifests itself in small ways			0
on one side , wives of @entity1 soldiers complained it would be difficult for their husbands to swear allegiance to @entity49 leadership when they had already done so to @entity170			1
on the other , residents sometimes approached @entity6 soldiers and shook their hands -- slapping them on the back in signs of support			2
the @entity6 soldiers seemed to be trying to keep it low - key			2
their uniforms bore no @entity6 army insignia that might inflame anti-russian @entity1			1
standoff near air base but forces remained poised to react to the slightest provocation			0
as more than 100 unarmed @entity1 soldiers tried tuesday morning to return to @entity187 , a @entity1 military base north of @entity189 , @entity6 forces fired warning shots over their heads			1
@entity192 shot by one of the @entity1 soldiers showed the @entity1 continuing to move forward			0
in the video , a @entity6 , holding his weapon , orders them to halt their advance : " i have orders ; i will shoot you in the legs if you come any further			0
" the @entity1 commander responded that they had no weapons and that the @entity6 were in control			1
the two sides then negotiated , and 15 of the @entity1 soldiers were granted passage onto the base			0
the commander told @entity2 he had been ordered to surrender the base by noon , but the deadline passed without incident			0
he said he had been told to sign a document swearing allegiance to the local government , but he was unwilling to do so and continued to take orders from @entity170			0
on the road to the base , @entity49 civilians blocked the entrance to journalists			0
on the other side of a barricade stood @entity1 soldiers			0
beyond them , at the main entrance to the base , were @entity6 soldiers , @entity2 was told			0
the commander said he had tried to speak through an intermediary with the @entity6 forces to arrange a meeting to defuse the situation but had not succeeded			2
the base 's structure complicated the situation -- it is home not only to @entity1 service members but also to their families			2
and even the source of much of the tension was uncertain			0
one @entity1 military commander said he had received anonymous phone calls threatening him and his family if he did not surrender to @entity6 forces			1
@entity6 president @entity244 has yet to acknowledge the forces here are even @entity6 , but a commander of troops -- who are wearing @entity6 uniforms without identifying insignia and driving vehicles bearing @entity6 plates -- was frank			1
he told @entity2 he came from a @entity6 city near @entity7 and had been dispatched by his commanding officer from @entity189 to a ferry port on the eastern side of the @entity7 peninsula			1
a different feel in @entity170 the mood was different hundreds of miles away in @entity1 's capital of @entity170 , which is more @entity261 in its location and self - image			1
protesters waved posters depicting caricatures of @entity244 and declared their willingness to fight against @entity6 forces , if necessary			1
the newly installed , @entity269 interim central government is shaky , at best			0
ousted president @entity270 fled more than a week ago in the wake of protests in @entity170 's @entity273 , where snipers from nearby rooftops killed scores of demonstrators			1
@entity279 secretary of state @entity278 arrived tuesday in @entity170 and surveyed a makeshift memorial to the dead before meeting with the @entity1 interim administration about the @entity6 incursion and a promised $ 1 billion in @entity279 loan guarantees to help the country rebuild its shattered economy			1
flowers and flags marked the spot of the killings			0
one person left a poem that read , " mother , i 'm sorry i had to go			2
i was shot by the police because i could n't turn back			0
" an acting president and an acting prime minister have taken the reins of power			0
a crisis in @entity7 is the last thing the new government needs or residents want			0
" the amount of propaganda @entity6 has poured onto @entity1 is hard to comprehend , " said @entity303 , a freelance photographer and christian ministry worker in @entity1			2
" putting troops on @entity1 land is going to bring the very opposite result from what @entity244 expected : i believe it 's uniting @entity1			2
" @entity6 state - run tv offered a different view , blaming the crisis on far - right radicals aided by the @entity316			0
@entity6 news reports note that @entity1 had called for a ban on teaching the @entity6 language in schools			2
that proposed ban has been rescinded , but the reports created an emotional reaction among @entity6			0
@entity2 's @entity324 , @entity325 and @entity326 reported from @entity7 , @entity327 from @entity170 , @entity328 from @entity155 , and @entity329 and @entity330 wrote from @entity331 .			1

new : a supporter of @entity1 forces says talks , not fights , will solve problems
