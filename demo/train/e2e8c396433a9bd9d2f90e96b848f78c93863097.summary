@entity0 -- the @entity2 has spent more than $ 1 trillion on wars since the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , a recently released @entity6 report says			1
adjusting for inflation , the outlays for conflicts in @entity9 , @entity10 and elsewhere around the world make the " war on terrorism " second only to @entity13 the report " cost of @entity18 " by the @entity17 attempts to compare war costs over a more than 230 - year period -- from the @entity21 to the current day -- noting the difficulties associated with such a task			1
since the the 9/11 terror attacks , the @entity2 has spent an estimated $ 1.15 trillion			1
@entity13 cost $ 4.1 trillion when converted to current dollars , although the tab in the 1940s was $ 296 billion			1

the post- 9/11 cost of the conflicts is about 1 percent of gdp			0
comparisons of costs of wars over a 230 - year period , however , are inherently problematic , the report says			2

in recent years , the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) has tried to identify the additional ' incremental ' expenses of engaging in military operations , over and above the costs of maintaining standing military forces			0
" " figures are problematic , as well , because of difficulties in comparing prices from one vastly different era to another , " according to the report			0
" perhaps a more significant problem is that wars appear more expensive over time as the sophistication and cost of technology advances , both for military and for civilian activities			2
" the costs associated with the " war on terrorism " could still go much higher			0
a @entity67 estimate from 2007 said the cost of the wars in @entity9 and @entity10 could total $ 2.4 trillion by 2017 , more than double the current amount			1
