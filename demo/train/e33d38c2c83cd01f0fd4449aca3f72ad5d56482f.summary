@entity0 , @entity1 -- think about the most memorable meal you ever had			1
was it just the taste you remember , or everything else around it ? to me , food is as much about the moment , the occasion , the location and the company as it is about the taste			1
it is the only thing we do that involves all the senses			1
it has the ability to generate so much emotion and so much memory			1
it is one of those subjects where the more you learn about it ; the more you realize you do n't know			1
i was born in the'60s and grew up in the ' 70s -- not exactly the best decade for food in @entity35 history			1
it was a time when , as a nation , we excelled in art and music and acting and photography and fashion -- all creative skills ... all apart from cooking			1
in those days there was only one type of pasta you could buy in the supermarket -- spaghetti in a blue wrapper			1
with olive oil you had to go to the chemist because you never cooked with it -- you poured it into your ears to clear out the wax			1
i had never eaten an oyster before			1
i had never eaten lobster			1
i had never even been to a gastronomic restaurant in any shape or form			1
more from @entity64 : former piano prodigy @entity65 when i was a teenager , we used to go to @entity67 and the south coast of @entity1 every year for our summer holiday			2
then one year we went to @entity70 and i had the lucky experience of going to a three @entity73 - starred restaurant with my sister and parents			1
it was as if i had fallen down some rabbit hole into a wonderland			2
we sat outside at the side of a cliff in this valley of olives			2
there were the trees ; the noise of the feet of the waiting staff crunching on the gravel ; the noise of the crickets filled the air ; the sommelier with his handlebar moustache and leather apron ; the wine list the size of something out of the tablet of a @entity101 film ; the cheese trolley the sound of a chariot			2
they were pouring sauces into souffles , carving legs of lamb at the table			2
there was just this whole new world and that was it , that 's when i got hooked			1
it got under my skin			2
i left school with an a-level in art. i had failed my chemistry exams -- so i am clearly not a scientist , but at the age of 18 , i got a book written by a guy called @entity124 , which was all about the science of cooking			2
@entity124 had written a section in the book where he said that browning meat does n't keep in the juices -- and that flew in the face of all the things i had learned about classical @entity135 cooking up until then			2
so from that moment on , i questioned everything			2
i was like one of those annoying kids going ' why ? why ? ! ' thinking about it now , if i had asked that many questions at school , i would have done a lot better			0
more from @entity64 : former @entity146 rower @entity144 so from the age of 18 or so , i was working , saving up			0
i was doing all sorts of jobs : i started off selling office equipment , which i hated			0
i did a few other jobs and finally ended up working for my dad as a credit controller -- basically accounting			0
it was a nine - to - five job , and at half past three every day i guarantee you would find me sitting , snoring at my desk			0
i would save for six months and blow it on a two - week trip to @entity70 , and it was almost as if i could n't think about anything else after that			0
in those two weeks i would go to restaurants -- i would pick three or four big ones that would cost a lot of money			0
i remember going down the wine list and thinking , ' eeek , i cant do that , i cant buy that one , " or i 'd say ' i 'll have that wine but can i just have one glass please ? ' i opened @entity170 in 1995 , staffed by just myself and a pot - washer , that was it			1
i was cooking @entity135 bistro things - steak and chips , lemon tart and those kinds of things			0
my first original dish creation was a just few years before			0
it was ' triple cooked chips ' -- my solution to the problem of why chips go soggy			0
and so even though then i was doing bistro cooking , that element of science -- the knowledge of what happens when we cook on a scientific level -- had already started to influence my food			0
along the journey from then to now i was two days away from going bankrupt -- i had to sell a house , sell cars , had to sell everything just to keep the restaurant going			1
you kind of kiss goodbye to a life for a big chunk of time			0
you have levels of exhaustion you just did n't know were possible			0
i think one week i had just twelve hours sleep			0
it 's not just that you cook nice a meal			1
you finish and then you have to clean everything down and then you have to start again the next day			0
so you have to sacrifice everything , but at the same time you could say it is a very selfish pursuit			0
i 'm in a position now that has exceeded anything i could ever have hoped or dreamed for , but i do n't even know what it was that was driving me			0
i did n't really have an ambition ; i just wanted to be better and better and better , and it was never good enough .			0
