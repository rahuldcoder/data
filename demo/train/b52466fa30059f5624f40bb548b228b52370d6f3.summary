-- the first time i saw @entity3 run , i was captivated			1
witnessing him caused me to jump up and down			2
my 10 - year - old son , an amputee since the first week of his life , calmly commented , " @entity8 , he 's just a man ! " i suppose that should have curbed my enthusiasm			1
but to see a man in motion without the use of feet was simply magical			1
i saw him as a future superhero for my son , who is missing part of his right forearm and hand			1
completely inspired , i felt as though i had witnessed the @entity21			2
i was so captivated that i started posting his likeness all over my @entity25 page			2
in short , i was caught up in " oscar - mania			2
" even my church pastor had preached about @entity3			1
the " @entity3 , " he said , represented christian values			1
he embodied things that i wish for my son 's life			1
seeing @entity3 at the @entity33 and @entity32 was amazing and did something very special to raise awareness of athletes with physical differences			1
however , in the hysteria , i lost sight of one simple thing that my son had been able to see : @entity3 is just a man			1
he has the ability to make the mistakes of mortals			2
he is not a god ; he is a person , and i got caught up in the passion			2
in full : @entity3 ' affidavit to court we do n't know what really happened			1
i would like to believe that @entity51 's death was a horrible accident			1
@entity3 may or may not be guilty			1
but , whatever happened , there is a lesson : too often in life , we put people on pedestals			2
we set them up to fail			0
the reality is that , despite their seemingly superhuman performances , they are just people with their own sets of challenges			0
the truth is , i wanted my son to have a role model			1
the first part of his life was filled with questions for me			2
i wanted someone to tell me that he would be ok			0
after he was born , the first couple of times that i saw someone with a limb difference , i would race up to them and start a conversation			0
in the beginning , this approach brought me comfort			0
one morning at the gym , i spotted a man with a limb difference like my son 's			1
at the time , my baby was only 6 months old			0
i ran up to him and said hello			0
the guy turned and looked at me			0
in a thick @entity89 - @entity88 accent , he responded , " hello , my dear ! " completely embarrassed , i thrust my baby into his range of vision and stumbled to say , " he , he , he is like you ! " suddenly , his seductive voice changed to a matter - of - fact tone			0
in an instant , he said the words i have never forgotten : " this is your issue			0
your son will never really see himself as different unless you let him			2
" he continued , " he is young and you control how he perceives himself			0
so just relax and enjoy him			0
" i was mortified and completely perplexed			0
but on another level , i was grateful for his words			0
all of this made my husband laugh			0
as a man who lacks hair , he remarked , " honey , i do n't run up to every bald guy ! you should not expect to have a connection with every person whose limb difference is like our son 's			1
after all , they are just people			0
" so there , again , was my life lesson			0
we want to be reminded that ordinary people are capable of extraordinary things			0
but , despite whatever heroic and inspiring feats we accomplish , we are all potentially capable of doing great harm			0
i am grateful for @entity3 ' flash of greatness , and i am sad if he has fallen from it			1
