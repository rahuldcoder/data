@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 said sunday that it is " pleased " with how the operation to place a new cap on its ruptured undersea well is proceeding			1
officials hope the containment cap will stop oil from gushing into the @entity11			1
but while robots replace the old cap , crude is flowing freely			0
the procedure -- expected to take four to seven days -- continued to progress sunday as crews worked to position a transition spool over the gushing well to prepare for the new connection , according to @entity3 's senior vice president @entity19			1
" we 're pleased with how it 's going , " @entity19 said , but cautioned that the operation , which began saturday with the removal of the old cap , is only in its second day			0
robots removed six giant bolts from the apparatus early sunday so that the new cap could be positioned			2
if successful , the effects of the containment cap operation could halt the oil gusher that started april 20 after a deadly explosion on the @entity32 rig in the @entity11			1
but officials have said the new containment cap would be a temporary fix , and the permanent solution would still be completion of a relief well			1
there are two relief wells under construction			0
@entity19 said sunday that one of the relief wells could intercept the ruptured well as early as the end of july			0
" we 're feeling very good about how we 've positioned that well , " he said			0
the other relief well is expected to be completed in august			0
the old cap had been diverting about 15,000 barrels a day ( 630,000 gallons ) to a ship			0
@entity3 still is recovering an additional 8,000 to 9,000 barrels a day ( 336,000 to 378,000 gallons ) through a line connected to another vessel , the @entity51			2
" as we start to ramp up the additional containment capacity , we should see less and less flow , " @entity19 said			2
the @entity56 recovery vessel is expected to begin collecting oil sunday evening , @entity19 said , and officials hope to reach its full collection capacity of 20,000 to 25,000 barrels ( 840,000 to 1.5 million gallons ) per day within three days			1
over the next two to three weeks , 60,000 to 80,000 barrels ( 2.52 million to 3.36 million gallons ) a day should be collected as part of the containment process , @entity19 said			0
scientists estimate that 35,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil are spewing daily from @entity3 's breached well			2
@entity3 says there will be a period of decreased oil and gas capture from the wellhead during the cap replacement			1
it said another recovery vessel , the @entity51 , " should continue to capture and flare oil and gas			1
" there will be other recovery vessels and skimmers deployed			0
two more oil skimmers were added to the @entity11 sunday bringing the total to 48 collecting an oil and water mix from the surface , @entity3 officials said			1
and another 15 burns were conducted in calm seas			0
" it was a good day in trying to contain the oil that made it out to the surface , " @entity19 said			0
@entity19 also said there will be " significant measurement capability " added to the new cap so officials can get a good idea of the flow rate			2
@entity3 said in a statement that the new cap " should improve containment efficiency during hurricane season by allowing shorter disconnect and reconnect times			2
" retired coast guard adm. @entity97 said friday that the new cap would allow responders to collect more accurate oil flow data and that , once the switch is complete , the resulting capacity to contain oil " will be far greater than the capabilities we have achieved using current systems			1

new : new recovery vessel expected to begin *siphoning* oil sunday evening
@entity3 : cap replacement is proceeding as *planned*
old containment cap removed from @entity11 well
switch will take another 3 to 6 days , during which oil will flow *unimpeded*
