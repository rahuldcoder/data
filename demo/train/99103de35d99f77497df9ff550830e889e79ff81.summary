" he told participants it would include the most " intense heat you 've every experienced in your life			0
you will feel like you are going to die			0
" the author described the october 2009 ceremony as a sacred way for participants to rid themselves of " all the things that you 've allowed to be your truth and have caused you to sell yourself short			2
" in the recording , @entity11 told participants , who paid up to $ 10,000 each to attend the event , that as " true spiritual warriors " and in their " altered state " they would endure heat so intense it would make it feel like their skins was coming off of their bodies			2
