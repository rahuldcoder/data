@entity0 -- if you 're expecting last minute action from @entity4 to avoid the march 1 spending cut deadline , think again			1
@entity4 is n't even in session this week , and lawmakers and aides from both parties say they do n't expect anything to pass anytime soon			2
why the lack of urgency ? the cuts can be phased in over time , and leaders on both sides of the aisle know they can act after march 1 to undo any reductions in the months to come			1
also , some @entity18 and @entity19 are n't totally unhappy with many of the cuts , $ 85 billion of which will be split between @entity23 and non-defense programs this year			1
many of the most popular domestic programs , including @entity27 and @entity29 benefits , are off the table			0
@entity31 , @entity19 clash on forced spending cuts with no sharp , irreversible deadline in the offing , all you 're likely to get over the next 10 days is an extended version of the partisan blame game			1
true to form , president @entity31 and @entity19 leaders ratcheted up their rhetoric on tuesday			2
" republicans in @entity4 face a simple choice , " @entity31 said at a @entity43 event with first responders			2
" are they willing to compromise , to protect vital investments in education and healthcare and national security and all the jobs that depend on them ? or would they rather put hundreds of thousands of jobs and our entire economy at risk just to protect a few special interest tax loopholes that benefit only the wealthiest @entity60 and biggest corporations ? " @entity31 more emotional on spending cuts senate majority leader @entity63 , @entity64 , urged @entity19 to " listen to the overwhelming majority of @entity60 and work with @entity18 to forge a balanced approach " to deficit reduction that includes new tax hikes on the wealthy			1
house speaker @entity69 , @entity70 , responded to barbs from @entity18 with a written statement placing the blame squarely on the president			0
@entity76 budget cuts , explained " @entity80 has twice passed legislation to replace it with commonsense cuts and reforms that wo n't threaten public safety , national security , or our economy , " the speaker said , referring to measures passed by the @entity19 - controlled chamber last year			1
" but once again , the president ( has ) offered no credible plan that can pass @entity4 -- only more calls for higher taxes , " @entity69 said			2
senate minority leader @entity92 , @entity93 , said @entity31 " prefers campaign events to common sense , bipartisan action			0
" by the @entity97 : automatic spending cuts @entity19 argue they 've already ceded on higher taxes by allowing @entity101 - era tax cuts to expire on the wealthiest @entity60 as part of the @entity103 " fiscal cliff " deal			1
@entity19 leaders insist that any package replacing this year 's planned $ 85 billion in cuts -- part of $ 1.2 trillion in savings over 10 years -- must be comprised entirely of alternative spending reductions , including entitlement reform			1
@entity19 are particularly concerned about the looming defense cuts			2
" even though defense accounts for 17 ( or ) 18 % of our spending , they 've taken half of the savings out of the military , " @entity115 chairman @entity114 , @entity116 , told @entity1			0
" the troops that are over there fighting to protect our freedoms around the world are being cut			0
the things that they need are being cut			0
" @entity18 and @entity19 are expected to propose alternative bills next week to replace the automatic cuts			1
neither plan is likely to get the 60 votes necessary for approval in the 100 - member chamber -- thereby setting the stage for more serious talks after march 1			1
the real impact of automatic spending cuts " there wo n't be any easy off - ramps on this one , " @entity141 said last week			1
" the days of 11th hour negotiations are over			0
" @entity147 political scientist @entity146 , who studies presidential and congressional politics , noted that march 27 -- the date when the current government funding authority expires -- is an ideal point for @entity4 to alter its current spending plans			1
" the upside to the ( current package of planned cuts ) is that it gives both parties political cover to make a dent in federal spending , " @entity146 told @entity1			2
" the downside is that the cuts themselves are not directly targeted at inefficiency , fraud or waste , and will ultimately affect voters ' daily lives in some way			0
" ultimately , she predicted , @entity4 will be " the big loser			0
... if history tells us anything about showdowns between @entity4 and the president , it tells us the president wins			0
and only one branch will face the voters again -- @entity4			0
" @entity181 : @entity31 ca n't kick his legacy down the road			0

@entity4 is unlikely to act before automatic spending cuts kick in march 1
the cuts will be phased in over time and can be changed later on
*democrats* and @entity19 are blaming each other instead of working on alternatives
