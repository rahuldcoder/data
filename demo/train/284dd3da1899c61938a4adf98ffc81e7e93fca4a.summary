@entity0 -- a divided federal appeals court has ruled that federal regulators went too far with new rules to control air pollution in parts of the eastern @entity7			1
the decision tuesday is a blow for several states , the @entity13 administration and environmental groups , which had sought to prevent " upwind states " from emitting possibly unhealthy levels of contaminants across state borders , a requirement known as the " good neighbor " policy			1
but the @entity21 concluded that the @entity22 exceeded its authority when imposing the restrictions			1
" when @entity22 quantified states ' good neighbor obligations , it did not allow the states the initial opportunity to implement the required reductions with respect to sources within their borders , " the 2 - 1 panel said			1
" by doing so , @entity22 departed from its consistent prior approach to implementing the good neighbor provision and violated the act			2
" the issue was tossed back to federal officials to rewrite the regulations			1
a number of states and power companies had sued over the july 2011 rule limiting power plant emissions in 28 " upwind " states			2
the court opinion written by judge @entity47 said some upwind states were unfairly being required to reduce emissions " by more than their own significant contributions to a downwind state 's nonattainment			1
" @entity47 described a " @entity58 " scenario that would make it hard for states to comply with federal rules			2
" @entity22 faults the states for not hitting that impossible - to - know target with their ( @entity63 ) submissions , " @entity47 said			1
" in effect , @entity22 's view is that the only chance states have to hit the target is before @entity22 defines the target			1
by the time @entity22 makes the target clear , it 's already too late for the states to comply			1
" he was supported by judge @entity70			0
both were named to the bench by president @entity73			0
less stringent rules set up by the @entity73 administration will now go into place until the rules are rewritten			0
the requirement is known as the @entity79			0
under the @entity81 , the good neighbor provision requires upwind states to bear responsibility for what the appeals court said was their fair share of " the mess " in downwind states			1
in dissent , judge @entity89 said the court majority exceeded its authority , ignoring congressional intent			2
" the result is an unsettling of the consistent precedent of this court strictly enforcing jurisdictional limits , a redesign of @entity104 's vision of cooperative federalism between the states and the federal government in implementing the @entity81 based on the court 's own notions of absurdity and logic that are unsupported by a factual record , and a trampling on this court 's precedent on which the ( @entity22 ) was entitled to rely in developing the @entity116 rather than be blindsided by arguments raised for the first time in this court , " wrote @entity94 , a @entity95 appointee to the appeals court			1
environmental groups also criticized the ruling			0
" this decision allows harmful power plant air pollution to continue to aggravate major health problems and foul up our air			0
this is a loss for all of us but especially for those living downwind from major polluters , " said @entity127 of the @entity128			0
" this rule would have prevented thousands of premature deaths and saved tens of billions of dollars a year in health costs , but two judges blocked that from happening and forced @entity22 to further delay long overdue health safeguards for @entity7			1
" but @entity138 was among those states critical of the administration 's new rules			0
" yet another federal court has reined in an overreaching @entity22 for violating federal law and intruding on @entity138 sovereignty , " @entity138 attorney general @entity142 said			2
" vindicating the state 's objections to @entity22 's aggressive and lawless approach , today 's decision is an important victory for federalism and a rebuke to a federal bureaucracy run amok			2
" the federal government now has the option now of asking the @entity156 to accept the case for review			0
the agency finalized separate new federal standards on toxic pollutants and mercury emissions from coal power plants last fall			0
that move was praised by environmentalists but criticized by others , who predict lost jobs and a strain on the nation 's power grid			0
lawsuits over those new rules have been filed			0
the case decided tuesday is @entity174 v. @entity22 ( 11 - 1302 ) .			0

the regulations sought to limit contaminants released by " upwind states "
a @entity7 @entity181 panel said the @entity22 exceeded its authority
