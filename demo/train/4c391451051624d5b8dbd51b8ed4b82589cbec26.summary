@entity0 -- for @entity3 , it 's important to act fast when a call comes to rescue a bear cub from the other side of @entity0			1
" there 's a vulnerable animal in distress up to nine or 10 hours away , so there 's a sense of urgency to get there as soon as possible , " says @entity3 , the regional director of @entity8 non-profit @entity7			1
" you put emotions on hold and start mobilizing -- readying equipment , cages , everything we might need			0
" free the @entity7 has been in @entity0 17 years and in that time has rescued 182 bears , an average of nearly one a month			1
some come from private residences , others from wildlife traffickers or even garment factories			0
the condition in which they find them " is extremely variable			0
" " we had cubs come in [ in august ] that were just one week old , and they are now doing very well , considering , " he says , referring to twin sun bear cubs nicknamed " @entity39 " and " donut			2
" " then recently we had one bear arrive in such bad condition that it died as soon as we moved it from the crate and onto the operating table -- even though we had five emergency vets there			2
" rescuing number 182 the bear they raced off to rescue from the @entity51 district near the @entity53 border in western @entity0 was a five - month - old endangered moon bear			1
known by his processing tag as @entity57 182 , the male cub was in reasonable shape despite being somewhat malnourished and carrying an injury thought to have been inflicted by a snare			0
" when the hunters came along to check the snare , the mum would have left and the hunters would have taken the bear cub , " says @entity3 , as he works to pacify the stressed animal with clucking sounds to imitate its absent mother			2
" but there 's no sign of any wound or any blood now			0
it 's healed over very nicely actually			0
" @entity3 says most animals arriving at @entity7 ' sanctuary outside the capital @entity78 are cubs , some of which were intercepted while being trafficked to so - called " bear farms " in neighboring @entity83 and @entity84 , where they are caged and their bile extracted in a painful process			1
bear bile is a source of @entity92 acid , which is used in traditional @entity94 medicine to treat everything from gallstones to muscle aches			1
excess stock is used in toothpaste and shampoo			0
it 's estimated that 13,000 bears are currently held captive in bear bile farms across @entity104			1
@entity3 reckons that would likely have been this young bear 's fate			2
@entity107 although on this occasion @entity7 fetched the cub , that work more often falls on the shoulders of the country 's @entity112 ( @entity112 ) , a counter-trafficking program whose operations are supported by @entity117 non-profit @entity116			1
the @entity112 , which is comprised of government officials , military police and @entity116 staff , operates a hotline for members of the public to report the illegal trade in wildlife			2
it also inspects markets , restaurants and border crossings and runs a network of informants			0
in the most recent quarter , the @entity112 carried out more than 60 operations confiscating hundreds of trafficked animals , among them two moon bears and dozens of macaques			2
the bears were taken to the @entity138 , a 2,300 - hectare government - owned facility south of @entity78 , where they joined more than 130 bears currently under @entity7 the @entity7 ' care			1
@entity112 's proactive approach was lauded recently by wildlife monitoring group traffic in a report that assessed more than a decade of @entity104 's trade of live bears and of bear parts such as paws , meat and bile			1
@entity144 says @entity0 led 16 other @entity153 nations in the number of seizures : 190 in total , of which 156 were live bears			1
by comparison , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity53 , @entity84 and @entity159 managed just 189 seizures between them			0
@entity144 's data shows more than 2,800 bears were trafficked in @entity104 between 2000 and 2011 , but says the true number was far higher			1
and it warns that three of the four bears unique to @entity104 in the @entity170 family -- sun bears , moon bears and sloth bears -- face " illegal and unsustainable hunting for trade			1
" @entity176 , @entity144 's regional director for @entity104 , says the trade " is huge [ and ] it 's threatening the native bear species			1
" the problem is compounded by widespread government inaction			0
" enforcement in a number of places , especially in a number of major trade centers , is really lacking , if it exists at all , " says @entity176 , adding that the solution lies in large part in better enforcement , education efforts and raising public awareness -- something that non-profits such as @entity189 and @entity7 the @entity7 also undertake			1
" when it comes to bears [ @entity0 is ] definitely doing more than most -- i mean it 's not perfect but it definitely is a model that 's getting results , " he says			1
a new home it was early evening when @entity3 and his team arrived back at @entity138 , handing over @entity57 182 to @entity7 the @entity7 ' quarantine center manager @entity203			1
@entity3 says that on the way out of @entity51 , a place of subsistence farming and red earth roads in the foothills of the @entity210 , he was struck by the fact that villagers were not surprised to see a bear on the back of a pick - up			2
that implies trafficking remains common , he says , " and that 's sad			0
" getting @entity57 182 back safely after 850 kilometers of appalling roads , on the other hand , was a relief , partly because the team knows " it 's one less bear going to its death " at a bear bile facility			1
" there are n't many moon bears left in the wild ; they 've been heavily trafficked to neighboring countries and their population has been decimated , " he says			2
" so when we talk about losing an individual , that 's important for that particular species too , whether it 's a moon bear or a sun bear			2
" as @entity239 was coaxed into his den , the center 's two smallest arrivals were snoozing in a nearby room after a meal of milk			0
@entity245 sun bear cubs " @entity39 " and " donut " were just days old when villagers ' dogs scared off their mother from her nest in @entity0 's remote north - east			1
taking care of the endangered bears is a huge challenge not least because while young they remain vulnerable to infections			0
but under @entity203 's expert care , and three - hourly feeding sessions , the sisters are getting heavier : they are now eight weeks old and weigh more than four pounds apiece			0
" they are good , " says @entity203 during one feeding session			0
" they are growing well , they are healthy , they are eating well and they are very playful			0
" for his part , @entity239 will spend the coming weeks alone in his den undergoing a battery of health checks to ensure he does n't introduce diseases to the rest of the bear population			0
eventually he will be released into a large enclosure with other rescued moon bears			0
" we 've put some branches in there and he 's got a hammock and he 's got two guys who are going to look after him , so he 'll be fine , " says @entity3			0
" the future 's looking bright for this little cub			0

rescuers from @entity7 the @entity7 rescue caged bears across @entity0
many bears will end up in bear bile farms , and *subjected* to cruel " milking " methods
@entity0 is leading the way in bear rescues in @entity104
