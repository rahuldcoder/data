-- federal officers charged with keeping terrorists off planes are now searching their own ranks for staff who told @entity0 that few flights were protected by air marshals			1
@entity9 war veteran @entity8 says a @entity11 investigator called him trying to find out if he spoke to @entity0			1
the @entity11 rejected as a " myth " @entity0 's report that less than 1 percent of the nation 's daily flights carry armed federal air marshals			1
now the agency is conducting an investigation into who talked to @entity0 and who encouraged other agents to do the same			2
a spokesman for the @entity11 confirmed the investigation			2
spokesman @entity24 said a @entity11 investigator is looking into the " possible unauthorized release of sensitive and classified information to the news media by covered parties			1
" " as part of this ongoing investigation , several individuals , both current and former employees , have been contacted as is typical in any investigation , " he said in an e-mail to @entity0			2
@entity0 spoke to more than a dozen current and former air marshals , pilots and federal law enforcement officials for the report , which aired in march on " @entity41 360º			1
" repeatedly , the sources told @entity0 that as few as 280 of an estimated 28,000 daily flights had armed federal air marshals aboard			1
that amounts to less than 1 percent			1
" that number is absolutely wrong , " said @entity45 , the head of the agency			0
he was speaking earlier this year before @entity48 , which held hearings into the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) in the wake of @entity0 's reporting			2
@entity0 learned of the @entity11 investigation from a former federal air marshal and @entity9 war veteran , @entity8			1
he was not connected to the original story			0
@entity8 said he was called by @entity11 investigator @entity57 a few days after he came back from the front lines of @entity9			2
@entity8 said @entity57 grilled him on an e-mail he received on his personal account while he was in @entity9			0
the e-mail discussed plans to expose corruption in the air marshal service			1
the e-mail encouraged recipients to contact @entity0 correspondent @entity67 if they had information about the hiring of airport screeners as air marshals , the elimination of mandatory psychiatric tests for new hires and managers lying to @entity48			1
read the e-mail » @entity0 only recently received a copy of the e-mail			2
@entity0 did not have it when the report aired in march			2
@entity8 said he forwarded the e-mail to current and former air marshals			1
@entity8 said @entity57 wanted to know who sent him the e-mail			2
nothing in the e-mail contained sensitive security information , @entity8 said , nor did it encourage anyone to disclose information that could endanger the public			0
" i was petrified , " @entity8 said of @entity57 's phone call , explaining how he contacted @entity0 full of dismay that the @entity11 was harassing him and his family to find out which of his former colleagues had talked to the media			1
" in @entity9 , there were a lot of dangerous things , but never have i been so scared [ as ] when the federal government called me on my home phone and said i want to know about your personal e-mail account and what you have been sending			0
" @entity11 's @entity45 refused repeated requests to be interviewed by @entity0			1
@entity57 did not return repeated calls or e-mails			0
in an e-mail , @entity11 spokesman @entity24 confirmed @entity57 's involvement , but denied that the @entity11 or the @entity50 had accessed anyone 's private e-mail accounts , via subpoena or otherwise			1
however , he added that " all e-mails sent to government employees on a government system are always eligible to be read and reviewed as is outlined on every computer in @entity11 , including the @entity50			2
" @entity24 did not say how much the investigation is costing taxpayers or how long it would last			0
with a few phone calls , @entity0 was able to find the author of the original e-mail			2
the author is an air marshal who asked that his identity be concealed for fear of retribution by the @entity11			1
the marshal said he sent the e-mail because for six years , his colleagues have been trying to alert @entity48 about continuing problems in the air marshal service			1
many have left , he said , because of low morale and complaints about management			0
a may 2008 report from the @entity138 said that the agency " currently experiences a 17 % voluntary attrition rate and low employee morale			0
" " @entity48 does n't want to hear it , " the marshal said			0
" they stick their heads in the sand			0
we tell them about the corruption			0
we give them examples and proof and i think they are scared of what they see			0
and they do n't want to deal with it			0
" the marshal said he had done nothing wrong by sending an e-mail			2
" the only thing in my e-mail was my telling these other air marshals that @entity0 was willing to expose the corruption in the federal air marshal services and mr. @entity67 's e-mail address , " he said			1
" that 's not sensitive security information			0
that 's freedom of speech			0
" he said he sent another e-mail urging air marshals to contact members of @entity48 investigating the air marshal service			1
meanwhile , the air marshal service is undergoing a management change			1
shortly after @entity0 aired its first report , director @entity178 announced plans to retire			0
he has since decided to stay with the air marshals in a newly created position of integrity officer			1
his successor is @entity185 , current deputy director , who , like @entity178 and @entity57 , is a former @entity186 employee			0
according to the @entity11 , @entity178 's job is to ensure that " disciplinary measures and other personnel actions are administered uniformly throughout the organization			0
" former air marshal @entity8 said he thinks the @entity11 should spend its time tracking down terrorists instead of former employees ' e-mails			1
" if they want to tap into someone 's personal e-mail because they were going to destroy the @entity199 or kill the president , i could see reasons for contacting someone , " @entity8 said			0
" but they 're contacting me on my personal e-mail that i apparently forwarded to someone else 's personal e-mail account			0
" @entity0 's @entity208 contributed to this report .			0

@entity11 questions former air marshal about e-mail encouraging him to talk to @entity0
in march , @entity0 reported that armed air marshals are on fewer than 1 percent of flights
@entity11 denied findings , says it is investigating possible release of classified info
@entity221 says he sent e-mail because he wanted to expose problems in @entity11
