-- @entity1 has been chosen by the @entity2 to host the @entity3			1
in voting saturday in @entity5 , the committee picked @entity1 over the two other contenders , @entity7 and @entity8			1
the announcement came at 5:20 a.m. @entity1 time , but a large crowd watching on an outdoor video screen burst into cheers			2
@entity1 previously hosted the @entity3 in 1964			2
@entity14 's bid for 2020 billed the city as the safe choice -- despite radiation leaking from the @entity19 nuclear plant			1
prime minister @entity20 personally made a presentation to the committee and promised an effective cleanup			1
" i am so happy , i am overjoyed , " @entity20 told reporters at the post-announcement press conference			1
" i would like to share this joy with the people back home			2
we 've received so much support from the people of the @entity2 and i would also like to express my support to them			1
and to the people around the world			0
" a safe and secure @entity35 will be staged by us -- i think that was another hope for their support			1
i would like to pledge that we will be discharging this responsibility			0
" @entity20 said @entity1 would try to stage a successful games to thank the world for its support after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that devastated parts of @entity14			1
" @entity47 has the power to unite people , " he said			0
" we experienced that after the earthquake and tsunami in 2011 , when athletes came to our country and helped us			2
@entity14 needs the power of sport , we need hopes and dreams			1
" @entity20 said @entity1 's 1964 @entity58 had left a strong impression on him as a child			1
" i was only 10 years old but a lot of kids like me were fascinated			0
like many children i dreamed of winning a medal			2
it was a celebration giving hopes and dreams , " he said			0
" the joy ( of winning the 2020 vote ) was even greater than when i won my own election			1
" @entity1 's bid came in at $ 5 billion to $ 6 billion , compared to $ 19 billion pledged by @entity8 , said @entity71 , editor and founder of @entity73 , which covers the business and politics of the @entity35 movement			1
but @entity1 's government has already amassed a $ 4.9 billion @entity35 fund to pay to prepare for the @entity35 , @entity71 said			1
and a $ 1 billion national stadium that will be used for the athletic events and the @entity82 will already have been built for the @entity83 in 2017 and is not considered an @entity35 expense			1
@entity85 would have been the first @entity86 country to host the @entity35 , and with a median age of less than 30 years , one of the youngest			1
however , it missed out for the fifth time			0
@entity8 would have been " a more emotional choice , " @entity71 said			1
but its huge bid would have been needed to fund infrastructure improvements , including modernization of its transportation system			0
@entity85 's border with @entity100 also might have troubled some committee members , he said			0
and this summer , the image of @entity85 sport took a hit when about three dozen athletes tested positive for drugs , he said			2
june 's rioting in @entity8 's @entity108 may also have tainted the city 's hopes , though @entity85 prime minister @entity111 tried to persuade @entity2 members ahead of saturday 's vote			1
" we live at a time when our region and the world crave for peace , " @entity111 said as part of @entity8 's final presentation			1
" and at this critical moment , we would like to send a strong message of peace to the whole world from @entity8 , the city of friendship and brotherhood			2
" @entity1 led after a first round of voting saturday but fell short of a majority , with 42			0
@entity8 and @entity7 tied for second on 26 votes each , and a 49 - 45 tiebreaker vote put the @entity85 city in the final runoff with @entity1			1
@entity1 won the deciding vote , 60 to @entity8 's 36 , according to an @entity2 tweet			1
@entity7 , like @entity1 , was a repeat bidder -- making its third consecutive case for the @entity35 , one that was little changed from previous attempts , @entity71 said			2
the @entity142 ' $ 2 billion bid said they had little need for new infrastructure , he said			0
and they have ample sports experience , having hosted a number of other high - profile , international events			0
but the country 's economic plight remained a drawback , with one out of four adults unemployed			2
though prime minister @entity158 insisted that rate is improving , " the fact is that most reasonable , sensible economists think unemployment is going to linger at a high level for years to come , " @entity71 said			1
and @entity142 's athletes , too , have had issues with doping accusations			0
in a case that occurred several years ago , blood bags from athletes who had tested positive were destroyed , @entity71 said			0
" it 's been a long - running situation			0
" @entity142 's prince @entity168 , a former @entity35 sailor , was a lead figure in @entity142 's presentation			2
" some people around the world have questioned hosting the @entity35 in a time of economic uncertainty , " he told the @entity2 members saturday ahead of the voting			1
" but i do n't see this as a threat to the @entity58 , i see it as an opportunity			0
the benefits of sport are measured in generations , not in dollars			0
" on sunday , the three sports competing to be added to the 2020 roster will know their fate			2
squash is hoping to be included for the first time , but is up against a combined baseball / softball bid and wrestling -- which is seeking to be reinstated			0
the 125th @entity191 will be the last for its president @entity193 , who is standing down after 12 years in the role			0
the 71 - year - old 's successor will be elected tuesday			0
the @entity197 will be in @entity198			0
the @entity58 will be held in @entity199 in 2014 and @entity200 in 2018			0
