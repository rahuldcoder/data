as @entity1 took aim at the @entity3 , president @entity0 discarded campaign events in @entity5 and @entity6 to return to @entity7 and address the storm from the @entity9			1
@entity0 visits @entity10 : ' storm is not yet over ' @entity12 adjusted his schedule to hit the battleground state of @entity15 and direct campaign resources in @entity6 and @entity17 to focus on storm relief			1
@entity12 on storm aftermath : ' people are hurting ' the candidates sought to balance the real threat of a killer storm against the need to squeeze out any last - minute advantages in battleground states ahead of next tuesday 's vote			1
for the next few days , routine campaigning may be put on the shelf			0
this week , it may all be about who can behave the most presidential			0
@entity0 was staying put in @entity7 on tuesday and wednesday , while @entity12 attended an event in @entity15 where his campaign sought goods and other help for those in states affected by the storm			1
@entity41 : @entity1 introduces big unknown into campaign @entity44 , a professor of public service at @entity47 's @entity46 , said @entity0 did the right thing by returning to the nation 's capital as the storm approached			1
" people will claim he did it for political reasons , but i believe he deserves the benefit of any doubts			0
he did exactly what he should be doing as president , " said @entity44 , who is also a @entity58 contributor			0
" that is part of the job			0
presidents are expected to lead in a time of crisis			0
" the candidates are treading carefully in dealing with the storm 's political fallout			1
both the president and @entity12 canceled more than a dozen campaign events since saturday so as not to appear insensitive , chew up resources and otherwise get in the way of storm preparations			1
for the moment , the political optics may favor @entity0 , said @entity77 , director of the @entity79 's @entity78			1
@entity1 disrupts campaigns " the better the response the better @entity0 is going to look , " @entity77 said			1
" the worse the response ... the worse he 's going to look			1
this presidential moment could help or hurt him			0
" @entity0 signed disaster declarations for @entity85 and @entity86 , which were hit by severe flooding and wind damage , as well as other states and the @entity7			2
@entity6 was the lone battleground state in @entity1 's path			0
the @entity9 said that @entity0 would remain in @entity7 on wednesday as well to monitor the storm response and would not participate in campaign events scheduled for @entity15			1
@entity0 administration officials stressed they would work with states to ensure disaster aid is available for the millions affected by the storm			1
a @entity9 official said @entity0 told officials that he wants them to think creatively about ways to help states hit by power outages affecting at least seven million people throughout the mid @entity104 region			2
" i want everyone leaning forward on this			0
i do n't want to hear that we did n't do something because bureaucracy got in the way , " @entity0 said , according to the official			2
@entity0 has received briefings right along by @entity113 officials and held a meeting in the @entity9 situation room before reading a statement to reporters on monday as the storm approached			1
he said it would be a " difficult storm			0
" @entity12 also turned his attention to @entity1 during a campaign event in @entity15 on monday , saying " our hearts and prayers " were with those in her path			1
" a lot of people are going to be facing some real tough times as a result of @entity1 's fury , " @entity12 said in @entity129 , @entity15			1
@entity12 called off a monday night campaign event in @entity136 , and sent vice presidential nominee @entity137 in his place to another in @entity5			2
but his continued campaigning in @entity15 may not be seen as a issue			1
" as long as he is in states where weather is not a problem , i do n't see any problem with him campaigning , " added @entity44 , who is also the director of the @entity142 at the @entity46			0
" he really has no role in trying to deal with this storm			0
" @entity12 's campaign late monday night announced that an event scheduled for tuesday in @entity151 , @entity15 , had been rebranded as a " storm relief event			1
" " we wo n't be able to solve all the problems with our effort , " @entity12 told the crowd on tuesday			2
" there will still be a lot of people looking for goods even though we 've gathered these things but i know that -- one of the things i 've learned in life is that you make the difference you can , and you ca n't always solve all the problems yourself but you can make the difference in the life of one or two people as a result of one or two people making an effort			0
" @entity12 said he believed that supplies gathered at the event would be put on trucks and shipped to @entity86 where gov. @entity177 said on tuesday that floodwaters had stranded hundreds of people			2
5 things to watch in hurricane - wracked campaign @entity0 also canceled trips to the swing states of @entity5 and @entity184 , far beyond the reach of @entity1			2
a shrewd move , political experts say			0
" as voters , particularly those who are undecided , deliberate over whom they should support , they will watch @entity0 as he navigates through the storm and the post-storm clean - up , " wrote @entity188 , a professor of history and public affairs at @entity191			1
" the crisis offers an opportunity for him to act presidential in a way for which some voters are thirsting and to demonstrate the kind of command that has often been lacking , " @entity188 said			0
@entity0 's very visible posture is in stark contrast to his predecessor			1
president @entity206 's administration was widely criticized for failing to act in a timely manner during @entity208			0
" presidents for a generation or two will remember the @entity206 disaster with @entity208 , " @entity77 said			0
" presidents and their staffs go out of their way to avoid another @entity208 happening to their president			0
" similarly , when sen. @entity218 rushed back to @entity7 in 2008 at the height of the banking meltdown , effectively " suspending " his presidential campaign against @entity0 because of the " historic crisis in our financial system , " the move was seen as odd and impulsive at a time when steady leadership was needed			2
on the other hand , @entity0 's handling of the financial crisis -- appearing masterful while @entity218 appeared confused , marked a turning point in the 2008 presidential race , political experts say			1
both campaigns are keenly aware of how it looked			0
@entity12 was in a tricky position			1
he dialed back heavy campaigning and steered clear of pontificating on recovery efforts			0
" @entity12 ca n't do anything but express concern , " @entity77 said			2
experts disagree about whether the storm will ultimately have an impact on the outcome of the election			2
" my sense is that it is going to be a wash , " said @entity44 , who has worked for four presidents in both parties			0
" it wo n't change the outcome			0
" asked at the @entity9 on monday if he was worried about the storm 's impact on the election , @entity0 said he was concerned about those in harm 's way and how @entity1 might influence the economy			1
" the election will take care of itself next week , " he said .			2
