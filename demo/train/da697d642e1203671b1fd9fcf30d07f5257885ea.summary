@entity0 , @entity1 -- how big is big ? how open is open ? conservative leader @entity3 has said his power - sharing offer to the @entity5 following the unresolved @entity7 election is " big , open and comprehensive			1
" but will it be big enough to tempt them to ally with a traditional political opponent ? will it be open enough to persuade those in both parties who fear that essential principles or interests will be sold out ? will there be a conservative / @entity5 deal at all ? if not , could a @entity5 / @entity21 deal keep @entity22 in @entity23 as prime minister ? after knocking the stuffing out of each other for four weeks , @entity7 's major political parties are now jostling to buy each other a drink			1
listen to their public statements and you might believe , if you had spent most of your life in @entity34 , that they are doing so in the " national interest			0
" in fact they are doing so because all three of them failed to win the election and because the outcome has left them all playing a numbers game in search of at least a share of power			2
all three party leaders are under pressure			2
what happens next for @entity7 politics ? prime minister @entity22 is under the most direct pressure -- the pressure simply to quit -- because his party secured its lowest vote since the disastrous election of 1983 and shed 91 seats in @entity56			1
although he stays on for the moment at least in @entity23 as prime minister , @entity22 's moral authority has taken a hammering			0
his only hope of remaining there is if he can negotiate a deal with the @entity5			1
but he will only get the chance to attempt one if @entity3 's conservatives and @entity66 's @entity5 have already failed to clinch a deal			1
@entity22 's @entity21 is a more natural bedfellow for the @entity5 than @entity3 's @entity69			1
labour and the old @entity70 had a pact from 1977 - 79			0
both are parties of the center left			2
@entity22 had already , before the election , promised action to reform the voting system , a key issue for @entity66 's party			1
@entity22 is far more likely than @entity3 to offer the @entity5 their @entity80 of proportional representation ( their share of seats in parliament suffers under the current system )			1
spurning his advances could see the @entity5 lose their biggest chance ever of obtaining that			1
but the weakness of @entity22 's position is that if you add his 258 @entity21 lawmakers to @entity66 's 57 then it only gives them a total of 315 , still short of the 326 required for a bare majority in the @entity95 , which initiates and passes legislation			2
it would be a perilously unstable coalition , looking for others allies among nationalists from @entity101 or @entity102 or among @entity103			0
add @entity66 's 57 to @entity3 's 306 and you have a healthy 363			0
@entity3 and his conservatives were the nearest thing to a winner in the election			0
but @entity3 too faces pressure			0
many in his party are asking how he failed to win them an outright majority when they were up against an unpopular prime minister at the end of 13 years of @entity21 rule and the public was hurting from the biggest recession in living memory			1
those on the right of @entity3 's party resent his re-branding , or as some put it ' de-toxifying '' of the conservative party			0
with his bold , and many would say graceful , public offer to the @entity129 has accepted political reality and at the same time taken a huge gamble			0
if he fails to bring off a deal then it will be seen as a compounding failure by his critics			0
but he will be in internal trouble too if , in order to clinch the deal , he concedes more than his party hardliners would like			0
many @entity69 are viscerally opposed , for example , to voting reforms , especially proportional representation , because they fear that it would ensure that future @entity7 governments are nearly always " progressive " coalitions between @entity21 and the @entity5			1
if @entity3 does n't clinch a deal with @entity66 and the @entity5 go off and strike a deal with @entity21 , thereby allowing @entity21 to continue in government , then @entity3 too may have missed a key opportunity to become prime minister			1
by the time he next fights an election , @entity21 will almost certainly have replaced @entity22 with a more appealing , younger figure			0
if he could n't seal the deal with the @entity7 electorate against @entity22 , then @entity3 may find it much harder going next time			2
ironically , although the @entity5 lost seats at the election -- despite the breakthrough they seemed to have achieved after the first tv leaders debate -- @entity66 has found himself in a high profile position as the potential kingmaker			1
but he too has his pressures			0
there are plenty of @entity5 who would be appalled at their party linking up with a @entity165 that is more euroskeptic than at any time in its history			1
plenty feel that @entity3 is merely trying to lure them in as cover for a program of slashing government spending			0
@entity5 and @entity69 could forge some common ground on civil liberties , on education , on taxation reform , on green issues and on civil liberties questions such as scrapping @entity21 's plan for identity cards			2
but the two parties emphatically do n't agree on @entity182 , on immigration and on the future of the @entity186 nuclear missile system			2
above all , many @entity5 dems feel that they could not trust any offer on voting reform from a party that is instinctively opposed to reform in general and to proportional representation in particular			1
but what if @entity66 were to reject the @entity165 invitation and do a more advantageous deal on voting reform with @entity22 , who is offering a voting reform referendum ? then , he knows , the resulting group would be hounded by the predominantly @entity165 - inclined @entity7 media as a " coalition of losers " who had put back in no 10 @entity23 a man who comprehensively lost the election			1
hardly the " change " which was the essence of @entity66 's campaign message			0
@entity66 's allies in particular are insisting that , against a menacing economic backcloth , their man is acting in the national interest			0
certainly he has won plaudits from some unexpected quarters for talking first to the conservatives and thus honoring his pledge during the election that the party winning the most votes and seats deserved the first chance to form a government			1
but persuading his own party , a party which sometimes carries a tinge of sanctimoniousness with it , that he has achieved an honourable deal may not be easy and he might lose some senior figures along the way			0
in @entity231 , @entity228 , @entity229 and @entity230 they know all about the process of bargaining for position in hung parliaments			2
in @entity7 it is an unusual spectacle , a game that has n't been played for 36 years			2
horse - trading is not always a pretty sight			0
it is difficult to do it without a fair amount of straw -- and worse -- sticking to your suit			0
but the @entity7 may have to get used to it -- especially if ends up with a new voting system .			1

no party won a clear majority in @entity7 election , resulting in hung parliament
the @entity7 has not had a hung parliament since 1974 -- and parties are not used to bargaining
much depends on the @entity5 and which party it allies itself with
one result of the current *uncertainty* is that the @entity7 edges toward a new political system
