-- dozens of affiliates of the @entity3 have issued travel alerts for people heading to @entity6 this @entity7 holiday weekend -- the group 's latest effort to condemn the state 's new immigration law			1
@entity6 's measure stipulates that police can ask the residency status of people being investigated for a crime			1
" although the law is not scheduled to go into effect until july 29 , the @entity3 is concerned that some law enforcement officers are already beginning to act on provisions of the law , " the @entity3 said on its website			1
" we hope the alerts provide people with some measure of protection from illegal harassment from law enforcement and inform them of their rights should they encounter it			1
" the travel alerts -- issued by @entity3 affiliates from as far away as @entity34 and @entity35 -- inform people of their rights when stopped by law enforcement in @entity6 , the @entity3 said			1
critics say the new law will lead to racial profiling and prevent police from doing their jobs by undermining trust in the @entity45 community			2
city governments and organizations opposed to the law have targeted @entity6 with protests and boycotts but @entity6 gov. @entity51 and other state officials say the law is necessary because of the increasing number of people illegally entering the state from @entity57			2
in addition , @entity51 has said the law does not target an individual 's specific ethnicity			0
" it would n't matter if you are latino or @entity65 or @entity66 , " she said last month			0
" if you did n't have proof of citizenship and the police officer had reasonable suspicion , he would ask and verify your citizenship			0
i mean , that 's the way that it is			0
that 's what the federal law says			0
and that 's what the law in @entity6 says			2
" in late may , a @entity83 poll found that 57 percent of those surveyed favored @entity6 's new law , while 37 percent opposed it			1
the same poll also found that six in 10 respondents found that the federal government should focus on stopping the flow of illegal immigrants into the @entity93 , deporting those already here and supporting more border security .			0
