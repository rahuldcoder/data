@entity0 , @entity1 -- a specter is haunting @entity4 : the ghost of @entity7 past			0
twenty years after the collapse of @entity10 - backed communist governments across the bloc , symbolized by the fall of the @entity13 , support for multiparty democracy has fallen in almost every country in the region , according to a wide - ranging new study			1
majorities still support democracy over communism in all but one of the nine countries in the survey , but only two nations have seen a rise in approval for democracy			1
and support for capitalism as an economic system has fallen in every single country surveyed			1
eastern @entity32 do embrace democracy and capitalism in principle , one of the survey directors said , but they are frustrated in practice			1
" they are frustrated with the way democracy is working in their countries , " said @entity39 , associate director of the @entity40			1
" they see a gap between the way they want things to work and the way they see things are working			1
" we do n't see people saying they do n't want free speech , free press or competitive elections ; we see people saying they want those things , " @entity39 said			2
but " they are unhappy with how things are working out			2
" @entity65 " stand out in some ways in this survey , " he said			1
" they are less likely to say certain features of democracy are important , " he explained			2
" there is some nostalgia for the @entity10 empire			2
" a clear majority of @entity65 say it is " a great misfortune that the @entity10 no longer exists , " while just more than one in three @entity65 disagrees			1
just under half say it is " natural for @entity65 to have an empire , " up from just over one in three who felt that way in 1991 , the baseline year for the survey			1
communist governments fell across @entity4 in 1989 , as populations rose against systems that had controlled them since the end of @entity84 the @entity10 itself collapsed at the end of 1991 as its constituent republics , including @entity65 , declared independence from the @entity10 state			1
despite the drop in support for democracy and capitalism , more people everywhere across the formerly communist nations in the survey are satisfied with their lives now than they were in 1991			1
the numbers of satisfied people doubled or tripled across the region but did not become a majority in any country			0
the @entity103 came closest , with 49 percent of people saying they were satisfied			0
that 's up from just under one in four 18 years ago			0
the results were different in the former @entity108 , which essentially absorbed its communist other half , @entity110 , at great economic cost in 1990			2
there , the number of satisfied people fell slightly , from just over half to just under it			0
even so , @entity108 @entity116 are about as satisfied as the @entity103 and ahead of anywhere else in the region			0
young people were happier than older people about the change from communism to capitalism in every ex-communist country in the survey			2
more educated people also tended to say things were better now than less educated people did			0
there is " a mixed picture about how people view minority groups within their countries , " @entity39 said			0
" fewer people in @entity110 today have negative views towards @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 [ @entity138 ] , but there are still very high negative views about some ethnic groups -- particularly @entity138 and @entity137 -- in some parts of the region			0
" the findings come from a survey of 14,760 people in 14 countries -- most in @entity4 but also the @entity148 and a few @entity150 nations -- by the @entity40 , based in @entity151			0
they compared results to a survey conducted in 1991 by a predecessor , the @entity156			0
interviews were conducted in august and september .			0

but support for capitalism has fallen in all countries surveyed
eastern @entity32 see gap between how they want things to work , how they actually work
just less than half of @entity65 say it is " natural for @entity65 to have an empire "
