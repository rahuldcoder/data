@entity12 's sales of 35.1 million iphones in the first quarter helped lead the company to double first quarter profits , while @entity14 's 11.9 million sales january through march was almost half as many as the @entity25 firm sold during the same period last year , eroding its smartphone market share to 8.2 % from 23.5 % in 2011			1
