-- a key province near @entity5 's capital is in trouble amid an onslaught from @entity9 forces , the @entity2 defense secretary said friday , signaling the @entity11 extremist group is continuing to flex its muscles and expand its territory -- on several fronts -- despite international airstrikes			1
speaking to reporters during his travels in @entity19 , @entity2 defense secretary @entity16 said there 's a lot of uncertainty about what will happen with @entity25 province , which is just west of @entity26			1
these comments are in alignment with those of a senior @entity2 defense official who told @entity0 that @entity5 forces are " up against the wall " in @entity25			1
some units are in danger of being cut off by the advancing militants , who call themselves members of the @entity37			0
the @entity5 ' ultimate goal is to take back some of the vast areas , in both @entity5 and @entity40 , that @entity9 controls			1
but right now , @entity5 forces appear to be mostly trying to survive -- taking defensive positions and using @entity44 helicopters again , even after two were shot down in the area this week , according to the @entity2 official			1
" we do see @entity9 continue to make gains in @entity25 province and ( are ) mindful of how @entity25 relates to the security of @entity26 , " said another senior @entity2 defense official			1
the first official said the @entity2 military is more confident right now about the @entity5 military 's ability to protect @entity26			2
the @entity5 brigades defending the capital are more capable and include @entity2 military advisers , so at least @entity59 should have a better sense there if there 's any imminent danger			0
@entity63 , a 42 - year - old colonel who belongs to a group allied with the @entity5 government , said that " a large number of @entity9 militants " attacked @entity66 , in @entity25 province , around 3 a.m. friday			1
what began with the detonation of seven vehicles by a bridge ended about five hours later			0
in between , @entity63 said there was " a fierce battle " with @entity9 militants on one side and @entity5 and local allied forces on the other			0
" during the fight , @entity9 militants set some oil containers and tires on fire to block the view from the @entity5 air support that was called in , " @entity63 said			0
" ... the @entity5 army and @entity87 fighters did not advance to the positions where @entity9 militants were fighting , fearing booby traps and planted ( improvised explosive devices )			0
" this is not the only place where @entity9 forces are fighting			0
oil and crime make @entity9 rich about 800 kilometers ( 500 miles ) from @entity26 , the @entity11 extremist group continued to inch forward in the @entity40 city of @entity99			1
the @entity101 enclave has been a hotspot for days , largely due to its location a stone 's throw from the @entity107 border			2
emotional and , at times , violent protests have broken out in @entity107 among people calling for ground forces to intervene -- something foreign minister @entity112 said thursday wo n't happen , so long as @entity107 has to go it alone			0
@entity107 's tough choice : take on @entity9 or the @entity116 ? @entity9 fighters controlled about half of the @entity40 city on friday , significantly more than even a day earlier , after taking over @entity101 administration buildings in what had been a security zone , the @entity118 reports			1
the @entity2 has launched multiple airstrikes to try to curb the @entity9 advance , including two friday that the @entity2 military says destroyed some of the group 's infrastructure and vehicles			2
but such efforts have n't prevented @entity9 fighters from restocking with munitions from the @entity40 cities of @entity135 and @entity136 , according to the observatory , a @entity139 - based monitoring group			2
nor have they stopped fresh fighters from arriving in @entity99 , which is also known as @entity143			0
the group that could help beat @entity9 @entity0 's @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 contributed to this report .			0
