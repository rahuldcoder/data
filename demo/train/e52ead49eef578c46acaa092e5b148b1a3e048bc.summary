once was a time when finding out if you were compatible with someone involved a complex social interplay of body language , conversational nuance and good food and wine			0
tomorrow it could simply be a matter of reading someone else 's t - shirt			1
a joint venture between design teams at @entity15 's @entity14 and the @entity16 have incorporated the social network into a garment which signals to other wearers your interests , associations and even if people are compatible organ donors			1
the group of @entity15 students behind the project - @entity28 , @entity30 , @entity31 , and @entity25 - wanted to look at ways of seeing how social media worked outside the confines of the computer screen			1
" we wanted to examine more tangible ways of representing ourselves in social media , " @entity28 told @entity0			1
" while what you wear is very public , social media is able to show who you are to thousands more people and this creates really big social consequences but it often does n't feel that way			1
" she said the idea behind the wearable was to probe this question further			0
" current technologies are very good at connecting people over great distances but they 're not so good at connecting them in the same environment , " @entity28 said			0
" there 's this gap and we wanted to explore that through what we 've built			2
" sporting a chic alphabet design on the front , the t - shirt 's pattern is printed in thermo - chromatic ink with a thin circuit membrane under the weave			1
the t - shirt uses @entity70 to pair with your phone and all your critical data			1
after that , all the t - shirt has to do is detect another t - shirt within 12 feet of a receiver in its collar and the wearer is alerted through a haptic motor which literally ' taps ' the wearer alerting them to the fact there 's another wearable device in the room			2
as with all social interaction , the experience is graded			0
after the t - shirt has alerted you to the fact there 's another wearer in the room , capacitive sensors in the shirt read either a handshake , touch or high five before the t - shirt starts transmitting your data and you begin wearing your heart on your sleeve			2
" we 've got a working prototype but we 've yet to test it on users -- that 's definitely the next step , " @entity28 said			0
she said the ability of the shirt to transmit data is only limited by the imagination of the designer			0
groups that need to find each other in a crowd -- from industry conferences to people who are part of a niche interest -- are likely to want to use the clothing to find like - minded souls			1
" perhaps if you need to know other vegetarians -- or those with a vegetarian lifestyle -- so it helps to know if i was at a burger place who around me is a vegetarian , " @entity28 said			0
while the shirt is still in the research and development phase , the group says that commercial sponsors have a growing interest in the product			2
" we 're testing its capabilities -- it 's hard to say what its limits are , " she said .			0
