-- anxiety disorders cost the @entity2 more than $ 42 billion a year , nearly one - third of the total " economic burden " of mental illness in this country			1
when i came across this figure recently , i had no doubt that it represented a real and serious problem			2
i have struggled with anxiety for almost 20 years , and when i look back at all the afternoons i 've spent paralyzed by the disorder -- ruminating over things beyond my control , crippled by concerns , waiting out a panic beneath the covers -- i see months upon months of diminished productivity and income			1
and yet , at the same time , something in me bristled at the effort to articulate the ravages of anxiety in financial terms			1
statistics are useful in coaxing policymakers to spend more on psychiatric research , treatment and ( one fervently hopes ) prevention			2
but no running of the numbers will ever reflect the truly tragic burden of anxiety , which plays out not in the realm of work but in the realm of relationships			1
more than anything else , what anxiety costs sufferers is the ability to love			1
when i was 21 , and just out of college , i fell in love with a bright and beautiful young woman named @entity44			1
at the time i was enduring yet another one of my periods of acute anxiety			1
i was jittery and unfocused , fearful and obsessed ; i could n't sleep ; i could n't eat ; my libido was gone			2
almost overnight , i recovered a sense of confidence , stability , optimism and poise			2
no therapist or pill had ever done that for me			0
@entity58 , i concluded , was the best treatment for anxiety known to humankind			1
unfortunately , what an anxiety disorder does to love is far more consequential than what love can do to the disorder			1
anxiety is a wily , reactive affliction ; it often recedes in response to positive life events			1
but it seldom recedes for long			0
like acne or arthritis , anxiety is always lying in wait , ready to flare back up			1
my anxiety came back shortly after @entity44 moved in with me and when it did it quickly consumed our relationship			1
the main problem was self - obsession			0
when people ask me what clinical anxiety feels like , i sometimes refer to " @entity83 , " the great memoir by the @entity86 magazine editor @entity85 , who , at 44 , suffered a massive stroke leading to " locked - in syndrome			1
" unable to move or speak , @entity90 became a prisoner in his own mind			0
an anxiety sufferer can feel as if he too is imprisoned in his own mind , but with the demonic twist that his mind can think of nothing but itself			1
anxious thoughts are radically personal thoughts			0
their central concern is what affects you , what threatens you , what you need , you regret , you dread , you fear			0
anxiety is a condition of near - total self - absorption , made only worse by the fact that the sufferer typically realizes that he is being self - absorbed and grieves over his sad inability to see past himself			1
you can see how this state of mind affects relationships by looking at the biographies of well - known anxiety sufferers			1
an anxious lover tends to toggle between desperate need and strenuous rejection			0
he or she can never decide whether being in a committed relationship is a source of comfort or humiliation , joy or pain			0
the most dramatic example i know of this is @entity127 , quite possibly the most incompetent lover of all time			0
@entity127 spent five years alternately wooing his unlucky sweetheart and trying to eject her from his life , using all the formidable logic and literary skills he possessed to convince her that he was a " sick , weak , unsociable , taciturn , gloomy , stiff , almost helpless man " with whom life would be an utter disaster			0
@entity127 ultimately proved his point , and so did @entity137 and over again , i pushed @entity44 away and pulled her back , drawing her into an abusive four - step dance			0
first , i would grow increasingly uncertain			0
" was i truly in love with @entity44 ? " i would ask myself			1
how could i be when we did n't appreciate all the same books , the same music , the same movies ? was it possible that what i called love had been merely infatuation , lust , desire ? second , torn by my doubts , i would grow withdrawn and sullen , even openly hostile			2
i would ignore @entity44 , make nasty little remarks , put her down in front of her friends			0
third , @entity44 would start to fight back			0
neglected and mistreated , she would respond with anger and sadness			0
why was i being so cruel ? what had she done to deserve this ? fourth , horrified by my behavior , i would try urgently and with great remorse to repair the damage			0
i 'd buy her flowers , send her cute messages during the day , hang on her every word			0
then , after a short respite , the dance would begin again			0
about a year after @entity44 and i moved in together , she finally decided that she 'd had enough , and broke up with me on a subway platform in @entity167			2
at first i was bereft , but in time i have come to see the dissolution of that relationship as the best thing that ever happened to me , for it made clear that anxiety is not merely a threat to one 's mental stability , happiness , or livelihood , it is a threat to one 's humanity			1
if i did nothing to lessen my anxiety , i realized , i would never become any of the things i wanted to become : a good husband , a good father , a good brother , a good friend			2
how could i become these things when , in my towering distress , i could pay heed to no one 's existence or needs but my own ? this is the question that first led me to seek out treatment for my anxiety in earnest , and to devote myself to learning how to mitigate the condition , a task to which , more than a decade later , i am still devoted			1
it also led me to a place where i could try , in good faith , to win @entity44 back			0
this did n't happen immediately , or easily			0
@entity44 and i were apart for nearly three years before our paths crossed again , and at first she was understandably wary of my affections			0
she knew firsthand the kind of trouble my anxiety caused			2
" how do i know you wo n't freak out again ? " she asked			0
i answered that i likely would -- i doubt that my anxiety will ever go away completely -- but i promised her that i would never again allow my anxiety to infect my love for her as it once had			1
@entity44 and i were married the next year and have been with each other ever since , and all these years i have worked hard to keep my promise			2
how could i do otherwise ? i know firsthand the cost of failure			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity215 .			1

anxiety disorders cost the @entity2 more than $ 42 billion a year
@entity215 : no number can ever reflect the truly tragic burden of anxiety
he says what anxiety costs sufferers the most is the ability to love
@entity215 : having lost , regained love , he knows it 's *critical* to mitigate condition
