@entity0 -- a key congressional committee opened its investigation thursday into the november 5 @entity5 shootings with a pledge to find out if authorities failed to " connect the dots " and could have prevented the attack			1
the head of the committee promised the inquiry would not interfere with a separate investigation into the shootings being conducted by defense secretary @entity15 and attorney general @entity16			1
" their investigation looks backward and is punitive			2
ours looks forward and is preventive , " said @entity20 chairman @entity19 , i - @entity21 , maj. @entity24 , a @entity25 psychiatrist , is accused of opening fire at a military processing center at @entity28 , killing 13 people			1
dozens of others were wounded			2
@entity24 was shot and paralyzed during the attack and remains in a military hospital			2
@entity19 said the committee will carry out its investigation " with respect for the thousands of @entity38 - @entity37 who are serving in the @entity37 military with honor and the millions of other patriotic , law - abiding @entity38 who live in our country			1
" but , he added , " we do no favor to all our fellow @entity37 who are @entity38 by ignoring real evidence that a small number of their community have , in fact , become violent @entity51 and extremists			0
" @entity19 said the committee 's investigation will focus on whether concerns raised by @entity24 's colleagues about his " mental stability and political extremism " were dealt with appropriately by senior @entity25 officials			1
among other things , a memo reportedly written two years ago by @entity24 's supervisor at @entity63 says @entity24 demonstrated " a pattern of poor judgment and a lack of professionalism " during his residency at the hospital			2
@entity1 could not corroborate the authenticity of the memo , which was obtained by @entity71			0
@entity19 also said the committee will examine a lack of response by federal authorities after uncovering an exchange of e-mails between @entity24 and a radical cleric accused of having ties to @entity80			1
the @entity81 has said it was aware of communication between @entity24 and @entity84 , a @entity85 - @entity37 cleric who has promoted jihad against the @entity37 and other @entity88 countries			0
but investigators determined that those contacts were " consistent with research being conducted by @entity92			0
" also , @entity19 noted , the committee will look into whether information on @entity24 gathered by a joint terrorism task force was shared with officials in the @entity25 , the @entity97 or elsewhere			1
@entity99 sen. @entity98 , the ranking @entity100 on the committee , said @entity24 's case " raises questions about whether or not restrictive rules have a chilling effect on the legitimate dissemination of information , making it too difficult to connect the dots that would have allowed a clear picture of the threat to emerge			1
" but a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation told @entity1 that when @entity24 first came to the attention of investigators because of his communications with @entity84 , officials looked at his military personnel file and nothing was found that raised suspicion			0
none of the items that have been reported since the shootings -- including the reported memo from his @entity63 supervisor or a @entity127 presentation arguing that @entity38 in the @entity25 should be given conscientious objector status -- were part of the file , the official said , but it was noted that @entity24 had done research about @entity38 in the military			0
thursday 's hearing included testimony from former army vice chief of staff gen. @entity136 , @entity138 consultant @entity137 and @entity140 intelligence analyst @entity139			0
" at a glance , maj. @entity24 's rampage at @entity5 looks a lot like what used to be called ' going postal , ' " @entity137 said			1
it was " a deepening sense of personal grievance culminating in a homicidal rampage directed against co-workers -- in this case , fellow soldiers			0
" for @entity24 , ' going jihad ' reflects the channeling of obvious personality problems into a deadly fanaticism , " he said			0
the committee launched its investigation only hours before @entity15 announced a 45 - day review of @entity97 policies to see if the @entity97 has fallen short in identifying service members " who could potentially pose credible threats to others			2
" the review will be led by former army secretary @entity165 and retired adm. @entity166 , a former @entity167 chief			0
at the same time , the @entity25 will conduct its own , more detailed review of its policies and whether they could have prevented the shootings at the post in @entity173			1
and those will be followed by a four - to six - month study of " systemic institutional shortcomings " conducted by each of the armed services			0
the @entity5 shooting has " broader implications for society ... particularly in these lone wolf cases , which are the hardest , " @entity19 said			1
" when people hear people saying things that seem extreme ... respecting first amendment rights , you 've got to begin to reach out and see if you can stop somebody before they do something very harmful			0

*incident* has " broader implications for society , " sen. @entity19 says
congressional committee opens inquiry into *massacre* at @entity5 , @entity173
@entity19 : @entity201 ' lack of response after uncovering e-mails will be examined
also to be investigated is whether task force information about suspect was shared
