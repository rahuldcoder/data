editor 's note : beauty and makeup expert @entity2 saves the day with tricks to age - proof your smile , grow out bangs , and make blush stay put			1
( @entity9 ) -- @entity10 from @entity11 asks : i let my hairstylist cut my bangs , but now i hate them ! what can i do ? @entity2 : it 's one of those things that 's happened to all of us			1
( i once got a cut that turned me into @entity21 from @entity22 € ” it took weeks to recover			0
) aside from wearing a hat or headband , i 've found that it helps to style bangs all piece - y ( using a tiny dab of styling cream )			2
once they get longer than your brows , you can pin them to one side with a cute bobby pin			0
another idea to get them off your face : hold the bangs together up in the air and twist back over your head , then cross two pins over them to secure			0
be patientâ € ” it could take at least four to six weeks for bangs to ( noticeably ) grow out			0
@entity9 : naturally gorgeous hair makeovers @entity48 from @entity49 , @entity50 , asks : your teeth look great ! how do you keep them that way ? @entity2 : a bright smile can really make you look young			1
i had my teeth whitened professionally years ago			0
but these days , it 's my regular habits that help			2
i go to the dentist every six months , brush with my fave @entity64 toothpaste , and rinse after drinking anything colorful , like coffee or red wine			0
i also carry those tiny floss picks everywhere			1
another good portable idea : disposable toothbrushes			0
a little makeup helps , tooâ € ” a blue - based pink ( think berry or fuchsia ) lipstick adds instant sparkle			2
@entity9 : 20 things that can ruin your smile @entity80 from @entity81 , @entity82 , asks : i want to touch up my makeup without carting around a lot of products			2
any suggestions ? @entity2 : when i go minimalist , i find i can add a pretty pop of color to cheeks and lips with a bronze - colored cream blush			1
i also multitask with a brown eye pencil to fill in brows and touch up gray roots			1
and a clear gloss or balm adds a nice sheen to lips ( or eyes ! ) , nourishes cuticles , and tames flyaways			1
simple , right ? @entity102 2011			0
