-- @entity2 golfer @entity1 has pledged $ 100,000 to the @entity4 disaster relief fund through his personal charity foundation			1
the 40 - year - old , who won two tournaments on the @entity4 circuit before becoming the first from his country to qualify for the @entity12 @entity11 , will give the money to the @entity14			1
" it is shocking and terribly sad to see what is happening every day in @entity4 and the difficulty they face in overcoming this disaster			2
the situation in @entity4 impacts us all on a global level , " @entity1 said in a statement on friday			1
" this is the time for us to join our hands together and do all we can to help our friends in @entity4			0
i have special memories of playing in @entity4 as it set the stepping stone in helping me to become the first @entity2 to earn a @entity11 card			1
" through the @entity32 , i want to implement projects that can attract continuous interest and support to help our neighbors in @entity4			0
" @entity1 has followed the example set by @entity4 golfer @entity38 , who is also playing at the @entity39 in @entity40 , @entity41			1
@entity38 wrote a note on wednesday stating that he would donate $ 1,000 for every birdie score he makes at the tournament this week , and left copies in the media room and players ' locker area asking for similar contributions			1
the @entity51 native , who moved to the @entity12 in 1990 at the age of 14 to pursue a career as a golfer , carded no birdies in his opening round of 74 on thursday but managed two in his 75 on friday			0
he was 16 shots behind @entity12 leaders @entity59 and @entity61 as he missed the halfway cut along with 19 - year - old compatriot @entity63 ( 73 ) and seven - time @entity11 winner @entity1 ( 75 )			1
@entity65 's @entity64 made a welcome return to form with a 66 that left him tied for third with @entity12 @entity69 , a shot behind the leaders			0
world no. 1 @entity71 was five shots off the pace , tied for 26th in a group including last weekend 's @entity77 winner @entity76			0
meanwhile , @entity79 golfer @entity78 has credited a cheap mobile - phone application for the form which has taken him to the top of the leaderboard at the halfway stage of the @entity86 's @entity85			1
seeking to follow up his maiden victory 11 years ago , the 35 - year - old carded a bogey - free four - under - par 67 in friday 's second round to claim a two - shot lead at @entity91			1
he said tips from former @entity86 player @entity93 had helped his putting stroke , but an @entity96 application about reading greens by noted short - game specialist @entity98 -- who has helped the likes of three - time masters champion @entity100 -- had really paid off			2
" that is the best 59 pence ( 95 cents ) i have ever spent because his tips have really simplified a few things for me , " @entity78 told the @entity86 website			2
" i have just been looking at the low side of every putt for the last two days -- really concentrating on the last third of the putt as opposed to the whole putt -- and that has definitely helped me			0
i have n't holed everything but i have hit my putts a lot better			0
" it was a bargain , i have to say -- you do n't get many valuable lessons for 59 pence these days ! the thing about @entity119 is that he is and always was an amazing putter , and you tend to listen to those guys a bit more			0
" @entity78 , ranked 206th in the world , is being chased by @entity126 's no. 64 @entity125 and @entity128 's @entity127 , both on seven - under 135			2
left - hander @entity125 , at 64th the top player in the field , bounced back from a double - bogey at his opening hole to card 67 , with birdies at two of his last three greens			0
they are followed by a group of five players tied for fourth on 137 , while former @entity142 @entity141 captain @entity140 was in a bunch of six another shot back after his second successive 69 .			0

@entity1 makes contribution to help those in @entity4 , where he played earlier in career
@entity2 *veteran* follows example of @entity4 's @entity38 , who asked for donations
both are playing at the @entity11 's @entity39 in @entity41 this week
@entity78 takes two - shot lead at halfway stage of @entity86 's @entity159 event
