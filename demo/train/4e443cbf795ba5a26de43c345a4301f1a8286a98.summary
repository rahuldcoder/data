@entity1 gov. @entity0 announced sunday the launch of a statewide program to fund college courses in prisons , giving inmates the opportunity to earn a college degree			1
the program , which will begin in the fall , will offer college - level courses at 10 @entity1 prisons -- one for each region of the state			1
@entity1 has 58 state prisons , according to @entity16 , spokesperson for @entity0			1
during a news conference sunday , @entity0 said this program is an investment in people before problems develop , rather than just paying for the damage after it occurs			1
it costs $ 60,000 a year to incarcerate one person and about $ 3.6 billion in total costs for prisons , with a 40 % chance of an inmate becoming a repeat offender , @entity16 told @entity31			1
" @entity32 had that famous definition of insanity , which is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result			0
but for years , my friends , we have been doing the same thing over and over , and we have little to show for it			2
it 's time we try something new , " @entity0 said at the news conference			1
@entity0 's program is based on a privately funded model started at @entity46 in @entity47 , which provided college courses in six maximum and medium security prisons across the state			1
some 500 inmates were educated and 250 received degrees , and of those only 4 % became repeat offenders			2
it cost $ 5,000 a year to fund one college education through the @entity46 program , according to @entity0			1
" the proof is in the pudding , " said the governor			0
but offering a funded college education to incarcerated individuals is n't exactly " new			2
" pell grants , which provide financial aid to students in need , were made available to prison inmates in the 1970s			2
but in 1994 , @entity68 passed legislation that eliminated @entity71 grant eligibility for inmates , and the following year , @entity1 banned inmates from receiving state aid for in - prison education programs			1
" @entity1 held onto a couple of small programs			1
but they were skeletons of what they used to be , " said former inmate @entity78			0
@entity78 , 42 , grew up impoverished in @entity83 and spent six years in state prison			0
while serving jail time in @entity87 and @entity88 correctional facilities , a correction council suggested he apply to college			0
" i 've never experienced that			0
no one in my life had ever told me to go to college , " @entity78 told @entity31			0
after two years , @entity78 earned a bachelor 's degree in social science from behind bars , with financial aid from a private philanthropy			2
now , @entity78 is the founder and president of @entity101 , an organization aimed at reducing the national prison population in half by 2030			0
@entity78 is also the co-founder of the @entity104 , which seeks to return educational opportunities to incarcerated and post-incarcerated individuals			0
@entity78 said his exposure to a liberal arts education showed him how to navigate a world that he had never known how to manage growing up			0
@entity78 said a statewide initiative to fund correctional education is a " win - win " for everyone in @entity1 and hopes other states will catch on			1
" you save money and you save lives , " he told @entity31			0
" you build the communities that are most impacted by crime and incarceration			0

@entity1 gov. @entity0 wants to give inmates the chance to earn a degree
the program will offer college - level courses at 10 @entity1 prisons this fall
