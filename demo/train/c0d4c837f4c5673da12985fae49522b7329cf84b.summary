@entity0 did n't sense a great deal of excitement leading up to @entity3 , @entity4 , elections on tuesday			1
his @entity6 is situated along the primary protest route in the city			0
people have streamed in and out of the eatery since it opened just before @entity12 was shot in august			0
along with handmade burgers and milkshakes , his patrons have been able to pick up voter registration forms from the counter where they place their orders			0
while @entity0 saw voters wearing stickers and some customers mentioned the elections , it was n't a regular point of discussion in the days before the polls opened			2
" a lot of people did n't talk about it , " he said			0
" it was a dead conversation			0
" @entity0 , who is registered to vote in @entity31 but whose wife voted in @entity3 on tuesday , concedes that general and midterm elections do n't excite him			1
but in april 2015 , when city elections are held ? when three of the six @entity37 seats will be up for grabs ? now , that 's a different story			2
" that , i would definitely be excited , " he said			0
" they 're going to have to make some changes			0
it 's not going to be the same ol ' , same ol ' , so i 'm excited			2
" numbers game since officer @entity47 killed the unarmed @entity12 on a @entity3 street , much has been made of the city 's supposed history of poor voter turnout			1
in a city that is two - thirds black , how , many asked , could the police force and local government be so overwhelmingly white ? even at @entity12 's funeral , some speakers used the occasion to call for social change , with one of @entity12 's cousins urging those in attendance to make their voices heard at the polls because " we have had enough of seeing our brothers and sisters killed in the streets			1
" to put it bluntly , voter turnout for @entity3 township was far from historic			1
of 24,334 registered voters , 10,222 cast ballots in tuesday 's election , a turnout of slightly more than 42 % , according to an initial tally			1
there was n't a wave of new voters , either , as only 204 residents registered to vote between august 11 , the monday after @entity12 was shot , and october 8 , the registration deadline for tuesday 's election , said @entity82 , @entity84 's director of elections			1
fifty - six additional residents have registered since october 8 , she said			2
of course , 42 % is only the initial tally , and the county has two weeks to verify that figure with the state , so the number could rise or drop , days said			1
still , she felt it was a strong turnout			2
" this is a very big number considering the last mayoral election , when mayor ( @entity96 ) @entity95 was elected -- that was 16 % , " days said			1
but comparing municipal to general and midterm election turnouts is apple and oranges , @entity95 said in an email			2
since 16.2 % of voters first put @entity95 in office in 2011 , voter turnout for the annual city elections has never topped 12 %			1
the 2012 general election , however , lured 76.4 % of voters to the polls			1
alternate views turnout , @entity95 said , is dependent on a variety of factors , including top - tier races on the ballot , the number of contested races , tax increases and the weather			1
" turnout is low in all municipal elections , period , " he wrote			0
" to try and compare april municipal election turnout numbers to november general election turnout numbers , and interpolating something about what has been going on here with that data would be dishonest			2
" asked their impression of tuesday 's turnout , @entity95 and the six city council members declined to share their sentiments on the numbers			2
" i want to thank everyone that took the time to come out in the dreary weather to exercise their right to vote , " @entity95 said			0
" i hope that our citizens will continue to engage in the community and be educated and active participants in government every day of the year			0
" while he did n't want to characterize the turnout number as good or bad , the mayor pointed out that 42 % lags behind the county 's preliminary number of 44 %			1
it 's also below the county 's totals of 55.8 % ( 2010 ) and 63.4 % ( 2006 ) in comparable midterm elections			1
@entity84 election records show it 's also about 10 percentage points lower than @entity3 's turnout in the 2010 midterm , which saw 52.2 % of registered voters cast ballots , and about 15 points lower than the city 's 2006 turnout			1
" turnout in elections all across @entity84 has been going down for years , " @entity95 said			1
others saw the numbers as a positive sign that voters are making sure their voices are heard in the voting booths			0
" a big shout - out to the protesters who took their protest from the street to the ballot box , " said community activist and @entity3 native @entity171			1
protests have been a mainstay on @entity3 's streets since @entity12 was killed , with demonstrators calling for officer @entity47 to face charges and lambasting what they felt was a heavy - handed police response to the protests			1
a grand jury is expected to decide soon whether @entity47 will be charged with any crime , and @entity95 told local media this week authorities to expect demonstrations and " prepare for the worst			0
" some voters undeterred @entity171 called tuesday 's turnout " significant " when you consider that the august primaries , held nine days after @entity12 was shot , drew only 25.8 % of voters to the polls			1
he also lauded those who braved a chilly autumn rain to vote , despite an underwhelming ballot on which two congressional seats and the county executive post were highlights			2
precipitation was n't the only factor vexing voters			0
there were other minor problems , said days , the election director			1
two of the 11 city precincts ran low on paper ballots , causing delays , a complaint officials heard throughout the county , she said			1
days also received a report from a local news outlet about ballot tampering at one precinct , but the media outlet did not provide her with basic details of the allegation , she said			0
the @entity225 - based @entity224 , which set up a hotline to report voting irregularities , received complaints that poll workers were requesting voters ' photo ids , which @entity4 law does n't require , and there were at least a couple of calls " about potential police intimidations at the polling place , " said the committee 's director of public policy , @entity238			1
@entity171 heard reports that people were standing in line as long as an hour in some @entity3 and @entity84 precincts , and he was impressed by the outcome of the races for county prosecuting attorney and county executive			1
the latter went down to the wire , and preliminary numbers show it will likely be decided by less than 1 percent of the vote			0
in the prosecutor 's race , incumbent @entity253 , who has faced criticism for his handling of the @entity12 case , ran unopposed , yet more than 11,000 voters cast write - in votes			1
@entity253 was handily re-elected , but the write - ins composed almost 5 % of the vote			0
by comparison , the second - highest number of write - ins came in the county executive race , with 3,713 , according to unofficial numbers			2
" @entity84 is realizing not only do black lives matter , but it 's quite obvious that so do their votes , " @entity171 said , applauding @entity3 voters for " turning anger and frustration into real , productive action			1
" looking ahead engagement could be higher , @entity171 said , but he suspects that it will be come april			0
there are already " some conversations on who 's going to run , " which he believes is " definitely healthy for a community that needs to get politically engaged , " he said			0
there is a feeling among many residents that local leaders are " insensitive , unaware of what 's going on or not being honest with the public , " he said			0
" i think many people feel that way , and it will show at the ballot box , " he said			0
" there are people in office in the city of @entity3 that need to be re-evaluated			2
i think the community -- you can see from the turnout numbers -- is taking note of that			0
" during his phone interview from @entity301 , @entity0 said he felt @entity171 's prediction was apt and shared a thought he 's sure will be unpopular			0
the community does n't want to think about it because it 's grieving and still in pain , he said , but if you can find anything positive in @entity12 's death , it 's that residents are thirsty and excited for change			0
maybe that was @entity314 's plan , he posited			0
" if none of that was going on , nothing would change			0
it 'd be the same as it 's been the last 60 years , " he said			2
" a lot of unfortunate situations bring about positive situations , silver linings			0
