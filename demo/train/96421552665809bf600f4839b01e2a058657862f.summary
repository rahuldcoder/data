@entity0 , @entity1 -- there are days working for @entity2 when you feel like you are in the final scene of the film " @entity10 , " hurtling toward an uncertain salvation from a disaster of epic proportions			1
fear and frustration are softened by exhaustion			1
your heart races , but every other sound is like white noise			1
you plunge ahead , but also long to return to the comfort of your own life with its own particular frustrations and joys			2
that 's how it felt pulling out of @entity0 , @entity1 , where an earthquake sent people gliding across the floors of their own homes , tossed some buildings into pieces and set off frantic unrest among people living without food , water or safety			1
we had been on an odyssey just to get to the epicenter of this disaster			1
we had left behind a documentary project on the @entity41 disaster to fly to @entity42 , @entity43 , where we turned around and went through @entity44 ; @entity45 , @entity46 ; @entity47 , @entity48 ; and @entity49 and @entity50 , @entity51 , before driving through @entity52 into @entity1			1
but we could n't stay long in @entity1 without jeopardizing that project			1
full coverage of the @entity1 earthquake even as this new disaster unfolds , there are still thousands living on @entity41 's streets in a crisis of uncommon proportions			1
a documentary on @entity41 's children needs to air while the public is still focused			1
meanwhile , @entity2 was getting more teams on the ground to help those already here amid tough conditions			2
our team of nine journalists and four drivers had arrived in @entity0 to join a few others , but we 'd all been stymied by the lack of generators or fuel to power them in a place with no electricity			1
we had a mountain of snack food and water , but until we found ways to get electricity , each attempt at making television was a challenge			2
then some of our local drivers confused the cans of extra diesel fuel and gasoline and filled the wrong fuel in the tanks			2
they spent half a day sucking it out of the vehicles , but then threw out the empty jugs we needed to get refills -- if fuel ever reappeared			2
it was a comedy of errors that ended up with three of four cars temporarily inoperable			2
it was cold with no place to stay , no way to power our cameras or equipment			2
the @entity2 logistics folks hustled , getting new people in with fresh supplies and gas			2
our @entity41 project was looming			2
we 'd have to leave soon			1
but how ? no fuel means no cars , and this whole region of @entity1 was at a standstill			1
the only thing moving was the earth , in constant aftershocks			2
and we were a 12 - hour drive from @entity119 , where the only big airport was closed			1
we hopped aboard one of the cars that still had fuel and headed to a small airport outside town			2
@entity0 , city of chaos it was n't easy : whenever you leave a story , a reporter feels enormous guilt			1
after all , you 'd come to tell people what 's happening , to hold the authorities accountable , to record history in the making			1
this town was in crisis , and we were leaving			0
as we drove , dozens of people rode around on bicycles dangling fuel cans from one hand , aimlessly searching for ways to power cars and light homes			0
we dodged barricades put up by residents to discourage looters and around piles of bricks from homes newly damaged from aftershocks			0
the air smelt like smoke and concrete			0
military vehicles and sirens made the only noise			0
we expected the tiny airport , which was officially closed , to be empty , but it was abuzz with the displaced			0
we were not the only ones hoping to leave			1
hundreds of people carrying luggage had slept outside the darkened terminal hoping some aircraft would soon land and leave			1
the @entity168 was offering rides , so we made our way to @entity119 where the @entity46 president had a few police planes offering trips out of the disaster zone to @entity45			1
we boarded the small airplane through the back ramp and saw that this aircraft was meant for cargo , not people			0
the gray metal " seats " ran along the sides of a curved plane that forced you to curve your back to sit			0
no big deal , we figured			0
it 's just three hours			1
@entity190 's biggest quakes since 1900 but on these planes it 's not			1
they have small gas tanks and have to stop to refuel twice			0
it was cold -- bitter cold -- on the " seats			0
" but everyone was so grateful no one whined , not even the eight or nine children wrapped in jackets much too big for them and tucked into their parents ' arms			0
we , too , threw on more and more layers -- mostly dirty clothes , as we 'd been on the road for two weeks			0
two hours in , the children onboard needed to pee in a plane with no bathrooms			0
there was no way to sit comfortably , and it was soon the middle of the night			0
the refueling happened in tiny mountain towns that looked like the surface of the moon			0
each time we landed , we 'd check e-mail on our quickly dying @entity218			0
another aftershock had hit , this time a strong 6.3			0
an e-mail went out from the main coordinating team in @entity1 , asking each reporting team to check in asap			1
then , a tsunami warning			0
finally , confirmation they are all ok			0
that was a relief , but word followed of another producer stranded someplace trying to find fuel and a generator to bring to our colleagues in @entity0			0
then , word that someone has found a way to go help them			0
everything on this trip evolved in 12 - hour clips , and our trip was no different			1
we arrived in @entity45 at 4 a.m. , cold and exhausted			0
some women kissed the ground , crossed themselves or cried			0
@entity245 's family is at least from @entity45 , so it 's a familiar place to one of us , but it 's many hours from home -- and many miles from the last big story .			1

@entity251 and her team go from one earthquake zone to another
they give a behind - the - scenes look at what it 's like to cover a major disaster
they experience guilt as they have to leave @entity1 and the story of its troubles
exiting @entity1 proves to be as *arduous* as getting into the earthquake - *ravaged* nation
