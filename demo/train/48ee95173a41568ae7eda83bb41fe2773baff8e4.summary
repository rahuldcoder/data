@entity0 -- it 's the oldest trick in the political playbook : call together a " summit " of fancy people so you 'll appear to be focused on work that must get done			1
thursday , the @entity14 convened ceos from companies such as @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 , top leaders of the @entity22 , @entity8 , @entity10 unions , @entity12 academics and a few small - business representatives to brainstorm how the country might generate much - needed jobs			1
a schmooze-fest is nice , but the hard work of putting @entity27 back to work will be done by entrepreneurs , not the leaders of the biggest companies in the nation and the heads of big unions			1
the mom - and - pop shops , garage start - ups and small businesses across the country will put @entity27 back on the payroll			1
according to the @entity40 , nearly all net job creation in the @entity27 since 1980 has been generated by firms operating less than five years			1
this means that our job generators are likely not on the @entity14 guest list			1
they are home working long hours to meet payrolls on tight deadlines and scraping by with limited resources			0
while others can advocate for the merits of entrepreneurship , and will hopefully do so , our job creators are strangely left out			2
innovators from @entity56 to @entity57 are the ones who will generate new jobs			0
@entity62 data show that small companies represent 99.1 percent of all employer firms ( a firm is an aggregation of all establishments owned by a parent company , even in multiple locations			2
they pay nearly 45 percent of @entity27 private payroll and have generated 60 to 80 percent of net new jobs annually over the past decade			1
a few start - ups from the last century may be familiar : @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity1 and @entity77 all started during a period of economic downturn			1
today , each of these companies employs thousands of people in the @entity27 and abroad			1
recent research shows that more than half of the 2009 @entity86 companies were launched during a recession or bear market			0
in 2002 , when the tech bubble burst , i graduated from business school just a few miles from @entity93			0
the start - up was a mysterious algorithm - based business , little known and lesser understood			1
today , @entity93 employs 20,000 people worldwide			0
so the question is how can we foster the next @entity93 ? policy - makers ca n't predict breakthrough technologies , but they can create an environment that will encourage innovation			2
how to start ? first , provide further access to capital			2
last week , two @entity107 stimulus provisions that helped to get millions of dollars to small - business owners ran out of funding			2
the provisions , passed as part of the @entity112 , raised the maximum guarantee on @entity107 loans to 90 percent and reduced or eliminated fees associated with the loans , making it more attractive for banks to lend during the downturn			0
access to capital is the lifeblood of small businesses			0
we must renew these provisions and provide even greater access to credit			0
helping fledgling companies grow fuels the economy from the bottom up			0
second , welcome immigrants who are job generators			2
we are a country of immigrants , and yet in recent years , we have made it incredibly difficult for immigrants to launch companies in the @entity27 why not create a new visa for entrepreneurs ? increasingly venture capitalists , angel investors and innovators are advocating a " start - up visa " offered to immigrant entrepreneurs who want to start a company in the @entity27			1
in 2008 , nearly 40 percent of technology company founders were foreign - born ; 52 percent of @entity147 company founders were foreign - born , including the founders of @entity93 , @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 , to name a few			2
why chase these innovators away when we need jobs and should be hanging an " innovators wanted " sign on our front door ? third , match funds for early investors			2
early investors need incentives to put money behind companies that will create @entity27 jobs			1
we have channeled billions of dollars to preserve " too big to fail " institutions			0
why not make federal matching dollars available to catalyze smart investment in next generation businesses ? investors could keep their normal returns and a share of returns on federal matching funds could go back to the government to further revitalize our weakened economy			1
instead of preserving outdated jobs , we need to fuel the creation of future employment prospects			0
early - stage investors with a track record of success can help make this happen			0
@entity181 came into office on an entrepreneurial platform			1
his campaign catalyzed involvement at the grassroots level			0
tapping into new technologies such as @entity189 , @entity190 and other social networks , our president benefited from entrepreneurial advances			0
it is time for the @entity14 to return to its campaign roots			0
since @entity181 's inauguration , our unemployment rate has risen from 7.6 percent to 10.2 percent			1
it is time to stop propping up outmoded and overleveraged institutions and start betting on the new men and women who offer hope for greater prosperity			0
supporting entrepreneurs is change we can believe in			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			1

@entity208 says @entity181 's summit had mostly @entity211 , union reps , academics
but , she says , most job creation in the @entity27 since 1980 has been from start - up firms
@entity219 : government funds and policies should target entrepreneurs
