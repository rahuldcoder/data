-- the @entity2 government has been mounting a campaign to boost vaccination among children in @entity2 after at least 20 suspected cases of polio were reported -- from government and opposition sources -- near the eastern city of @entity11			1
though the cases will not be confirmed for about a week , " as far as everyone is concerned , they 're treating this like polio , " said dr. @entity12 , the @entity13 's assistant director - general for polio , emergencies and country collaboration			1
@entity13 personnel were working with government health officials in @entity2 as well as surrounding countries " to stop what 's circulating in @entity2 and make sure it does n't spread , " he told @entity0 thursday in a telephone interview			1
but , given the massive refugee flows , " it 's going to be a tough one , " he said			2
wild poliovirus was last reported in @entity2 in 1999			1
the highly infectious viral disease primarily affects young children			1
initial symptoms can include fever , fatigue , headache , vomiting , neck stiffness , limb pain and , in a small number of cases , paralysis			2
it can be prevented through immunization , but there is no cure			0
the incidence of the disease has dropped by more than 99 % since 1988			0
it remains endemic in three countries , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 , down from more than 125 countries in 1988			0
the director of the @entity55 at the @entity56 , dr. @entity54 , said the campaign also seeks to prevent measles cases , according to the state - run @entity59			2
public health can be among the first casualties of war , as resources can be diverted away from ensuring clean water supplies and intact sewer lines			0
@entity13 said last week that it had received the reports of a cluster of cases of acute flaccid paralysis , which is defined as sudden onset of weakness and floppiness in any part of a child 's body or paralysis in any person in whom polio is suspected as the cause			1
despite the challenges posed by the ongoing civil war , the polio vaccination effort will be helped by the fact that @entity2 had high rates of vaccination coverage among its populace prior to the current conflict , @entity12 predicted			1
in an address friday to the @entity92 , the under - secretary - general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief cited the outbreak as an example of the privations endured by the @entity2 and the risks they face			1
diseases , including those easily preventable by basic hygiene and vaccination , are spreading " at an alarming rate , " said @entity102			0
in addition , reports of malnutrition have soared , and people suffering from chronic illnesses , such as cancer and diabetes , are dying for lack of access to treatment , she said			0
she credited the @entity92 's @entity113 with scaling up its operations with the goal of reaching 4 million people per month -- half of them in opposition - held or contested areas of @entity2			1
still , she said , " the humanitarian response in @entity2 remains severely insufficient compared to growing needs			1
" aid workers can not reach some 2.5 million people in the country , she added			0
" all humanitarian staff missions and convoys continue to require written approval , " she said , citing as " unacceptable " and " unpredictable " the government 's processing of visas for @entity92 and non-governmental staff members			1
more than 100 such visas are pending , many are limited to a single entry and many of those that are issued are for insufficient durations , she said			2
" there is simply no reason why humanitarian staff , whose only interest is to help those in desperate need , have not been granted visas to scale up our operations , " she said			2
in response , @entity2 's permanent representative to the @entity148 acknowledged to reporters in @entity151 that the country is facing grave humanitarian problems , but accused @entity154 of having failed to properly apportion blame			1
" she should know and say what are the root causes , " @entity156 told reporters , citing neighborhoods that are " under siege by the @entity159 because there are armed groups in these neighborhoods taking civilians as human shields			0
" @entity156 said his country is " a victim of interference by some member states into its domestic affairs			0
" regarding the issuance of visas , he said , " we are issuing too many visas to too many people ; we are a sovereign nation , like any other nation ; we have our own reasons sometimes to deny a visa to this or that individual			0
" @entity156 said @entity182 has extended visas to hundreds of people working for the @entity185 ( @entity185 ) , which is led by @entity154			0
" any minimal cases here and there " of problems " would n't affect the overall picture of our cooperation with @entity185 , " he said			2
in @entity2 , opposition activists blamed the war for more than 100 deaths friday in a series of incidents			1
a car bomb erupted in front of a mosque in the @entity182 suburb of @entity201 , killing at least 44 people and wounding more than 200 , the @entity196 said			0
other attacks resulted in 33 deaths in @entity205 ; 11 in @entity206 ; 11 in @entity11 ; five in @entity207 ; three in @entity208 ; three in @entity209 ; and three in @entity210 , the @entity196 said			0
@entity2 state television reported that the military ambushed and killed more than 50 " terrorists " in @entity214 , a town in the suburbs of @entity182			1
the @entity218 - based @entity217 put the number of rebel dead at 20			2
amid accusations by government and opposition forces that each side has used chemical weapons , the @entity2 government continued this week to comply with its agreement to rid the country of its stores of such arms , the @entity221 said			1
on thursday , the @entity221 said its inspectors had visited the 19th of 23 chemical weapons sites disclosed by @entity182			0
president @entity235 on thursday thanked workers at the ministries of electricity and petroleum for restoring services a day after much of the country was plunged into darkness by what the state - run @entity59 said was sabotage of a gas pipeline			0
according to the @entity148 , more than 100,000 people have died in the conflict , which began in march 2011 when government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters .			0
