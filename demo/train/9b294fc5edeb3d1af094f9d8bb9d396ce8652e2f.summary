taking a cue from some of its competitors , @entity4 on tuesday announced a smaller version of its popular @entity7 tablet -- the @entity6			1
and the company that introduced the concept of tablet computers to millions did n't waste any time bashing those competitor in the process			0
" others have tried to make tablets smaller than the @entity7 and they 've failed miserably , " said @entity4 senior vice president @entity15			1
" these are not great experiences			0
" at a media event , he unveiled the 7.9 - inch tablet , which is 7.2 millimeters wide ( the width of a pencil , @entity15 said ) and weighs less than 7/10ths of a pound			2
it will have the same display - resolution specs as last year 's @entity7 , not the high - definition " retina display " of the newest @entity7 , which also got an update on tuesday			1
the @entity6 's display will be nearly an inch bigger than those of competitors like @entity36 's @entity35 and @entity38 's @entity37			1
it will also be somewhat more expensive			0
the smaller @entity7 will start at $ 329 for a @entity40 , @entity42 only version , ranging up to $ 659 for a @entity44 model with cellular capability			1
those prices are at the high end of what analysts had predicted			0
the new @entity50 and the nexus 7 sell for $ 199			0
@entity53 tablet goes on sale for $ 499 pre-orders for the devices begin friday , and the @entity42 only @entity6 will go on sale in stores november 2			1
models that have @entity42 and can connect over cellular networks will start shipping in a few weeks			0
the device 's screen has the same proportions as the larger @entity66 , meaning that apps designed for the tablet should also look good on the @entity6			1
@entity4 promises 10 hours of battery life , and the @entity6 will have front - and rear - facing cameras like its bigger cousins			1
it also will have the " lightning " connector that came new on the @entity75 and new ipods			0
" this is n't just a shrunken - down @entity7 , " @entity15 said			2
" it 's an entirely new design			0
" as with other recent @entity4 events , today 's main announcement was n't much of a secret			1
leaks ahead of the event sketched out most of the relevant details , from dimensions of the smaller ipad to what sizes it would come in			2
the @entity4 event started off with upgrades to the @entity91 lineup , and a joke about expectations for the day			1
" you knew there would be something called ' mini ' in this presentation , did n't you ? " said @entity15 , while presenting an update of the company 's smallest desktop computer , the @entity91 mini			0
it starts at $ 599 for 4 gb of @entity104			0
@entity15 opened by unveiling the new version of @entity4 's top - selling @entity106 , the 13 - inch @entity107 the new version has a high - definition " retina display " screen for the first time and is 3/4 of an inch thick -- 20 percent thinner than the current 13 - inch macbook pro. it weighs 3.5 pounds , making it the lightest @entity107 ever , @entity15 said			1
its price starts at $ 1,699			0
both the @entity119 and the new @entity107 begin shipping today			0
ipad mini worth buying ? @entity15 also showed off a sleeker and more powerful version of @entity4 's iconic desktop , the @entity122			1
it starts at $ 1,299 and begins shipping in november			0
released only six months ago , @entity4 's newest full - sized @entity7 also got an update , getting a faster a6x processing chip , an improved camera and , like the @entity75 , @entity129 capabilities			1
@entity4 's full - sized @entity7 has been a huge success and still dominates the overall tablet market , so why go small now ? the biggest demand for @entity133 tablets has been for less expensive 7 - inch devices such as @entity36 's @entity35 , @entity136 's @entity135 , @entity38 's @entity37 and @entity137 and @entity138			1
a smaller @entity7 would challenge these competitors head on , combining their popular size with @entity4 's killer features : the @entity143 operating system , @entity4 's app and media ecosystem , and quality design			1
the @entity35 is great for buying books , movies and shows from @entity36 , and the @entity37 has @entity38 's well - stocked @entity150 for media and apps			0
however , tablets have proven they can do more than just entertain , and customers might be drawn to the quality and quantity of @entity4 's @entity158 selection			1
developers have been creating top - notch apps for the @entity7 for more than two years			2
the smaller @entity7 's screen is expected to have the same aspect ratio , so those apps would work the same on the new device			1
when the @entity7 came out , it was intended to be a consumption device			2
ads for the tablet showed people reclining in various environments , clutching the @entity7 like a book			1
the spacious 10 - inch screen was ideal for watching movies and tv shows , playing games , surfing the @entity176 and otherwise consuming content			0
that 's how most tablet owners use their devices			2
tablets are homebodies , used most often in the living room ( 30 % of the time according to @entity184 ) followed by the bedroom ( 21 % of the time )			0
" fully half the time they 're using tablets , they do n't leave the couch or the bed , " said @entity188 analyst @entity187			0
" if you can do everything on the smaller @entity7 you can on the larger @entity66 -- that plus the added convenience of being able to take it with you more places could take the wind out of the sales of @entity36			2
" a smaller , lighter device is more portable , and people might not be as afraid of taking a cheaper tablet out into the big bad world where it would be less protected			2
that would also be a boost for @entity4 in the education market , which it has been courting heavily			2
@entity6 price gives rivals breathing room			0
