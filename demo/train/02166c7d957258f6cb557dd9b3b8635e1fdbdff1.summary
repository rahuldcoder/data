@entity0 -- her voice was halting , but not weak			0
two years after being shot in the head by a gunman at a political event , former @entity5 rep. @entity4 appeared at the first congressional hearing since last month 's @entity11 school massacre to urge @entity12 to act now on gun violence			1
" too many children are dying			0
we must do something , " @entity4 said in a rare public appearance wednesday , reading a statement that acknowledged her injuries made it difficult to speak			0
" it will be hard , but the time is now , " she told the packed hearing held by the @entity23			1
teen who performed at @entity29 inaugural events shot dead in @entity30 the panel also heard from voices on both sides of the gun control issue in the nearly four - hour hearing that illustrated the deep political and ideological divisions over a longstanding issue			1
@entity39 executive vice president @entity38 blamed the government for failing to enforce existing gun laws and said new restrictions , including background checks , wo n't stop criminals from using weapons in violent crime			1
" law - abiding gun owners will not accept blame for the acts of violent or deranged criminals , nor do we believe that government should dictate what we can lawfully own and use to protect our families , " he said			1
@entity56 senators led by @entity58 's @entity57 , who is proposing a ban on semi-automatic rifles and ammunition magazines exceeding 10 rounds , argued that restricting access to such firepower and expanding background checks to as many gun sales as possible will help			1
@entity4 ' husband , retired astronaut and naval aviator @entity69 , called for a " careful and civil conversation " on new gun limits and a broad new acceptance of society 's responsibility to keep firearms from dangerous people			1
" our rights are paramount			0
but our responsibilities are serious , " he said			0
" and as a nation , we are not taking responsibility for the gun rights our founding fathers have conferred upon us			1
" opinion : gun makers , help keep weapons out of criminals ' hands sen. @entity89 , the committee 's @entity56 chairman from @entity91 , called for stronger background checks and a crackdown on so - called straw purchases , in which people who can pass background checks buy weapons for others			1
@entity89 has proposed a measure to increase penalties for straw purchasers			0
however , @entity89 avoided endorsing an expanded ban on the assault - style weapons called for by president @entity29 and @entity57			0
" @entity106 rights are the foundation on which our discussion rests			0
they are not at risk , " @entity89 said			0
" but lives are at risk when responsible people fail to stand up for laws that will keep guns out of the hands of those who will use them to commit mass murder			0
i ask that we focus our discussion on additional statutory measures to better protect our children and all @entity5			0
" the hearing came a few weeks after @entity29 announced legislative proposals aimed at curbing gun violence following the december 14 shootings that left 20 children and six adults dead at @entity131 in @entity132			1
the shooter , @entity134 , also killed his mother and himself			0
how the violent mentally ill can buy guns @entity29 's proposals include a ban on popular semi-automatic rifles that mimic assault weapons , a limit of 10 rounds per magazine , and universal background checks for anyone buying a gun , whether at a store or in a private sale			1
guns sold through private sales currently avoid background checks -- the so - called gun show loophole			1
@entity56 sen. @entity153 of @entity154 said at wednesday 's hearing that he is in talks with colleagues -- including several who are ranked highly by the @entity39 -- on possible legislation to expand background checks on private gun sales			1
sources close to both @entity153 and @entity163 sen. @entity163 of @entity164 told @entity1 the two were in serious discussions about co-sponsoring a bill to strengthen background checks			1
the @entity39 , which is the public face of the powerful gun lobby , opposes many government limits on gun ownership as a violation of the constitutional right to bear arms			1
@entity38 insisted wednesday that the current background check system does n't work , so expanding it would only create an unmanageable government bureaucracy instead of reducing gun crime in the country			1
quick draw : how the @entity39 's @entity38 keeps his enemies guessing " the fact is the law right now is a failure , the way it 's working , " he said			1
" the fact is that you have 76,000 - some people that have been denied under the present law			0
you 're letting them go			0
they 're walking the streets			0
" instead , he called for better enforcement of all existing gun laws and creating " an immediate blanket of security around our children " by putting armed guards at all the nation 's schools			2
at the @entity206 , spokesman @entity205 called @entity38 's statistic an intentional diversion " from another issue that is part of this , which is the need for broader and universal background checks			1
" " this is being pushed as a reason not to do something that the overwhelming majority of the @entity5 people support , " @entity205 said , later adding that " the skepticism you 're hearing " comes from those " who do n't want to do anything on this issue			1
" during the hearing , an exchange between @entity38 and sen. @entity224 , @entity225 , showed the deeply held positions on each side			2
after @entity38 complained that expanded background checks would only burden law - abiding citizens and said they make no sense because criminals ignore the system , @entity224 commented that the @entity39 official missed the point			1
@entity29 's gun violence measures : would they work ? " the criminals wo n't go to purchase the guns because there will be a background check , " @entity224 said			1
" we 'll stop them from the original purchase			0
you missed that point completely			0
and i think it 's basic			0
" @entity38 responded that it was @entity224 who failed to understand , adding as @entity89 banged his gavel for order that " if you are not prosecuting them , you are not even stopping them			0
" he and other opponents of more gun control also depicted extreme scenarios of @entity5 under threat in their homes and at schools to make the case for access to semi-automatic weapons and high - capacity magazines			2
" we all know that homicidal maniacs , criminals and the insane do n't abide by the law , " @entity38 said			2
another witness , @entity272 of the @entity273 , repeatedly described scenes of women at home with their children needing weapons that would be banned under @entity57 's proposal to fight off bigger , stronger male attackers			0
" an assault weapon in the hands of a young woman defending her babies in her home becomes a defense weapon and the peace of mind that a woman has as she 's facing three , four , five violent attackers , intruders in her home with her children screaming in the background , the peace of mind that she has knowing that she has a scary looking gun gives her more courage when she 's fighting hard and violent criminals , " @entity272 said			1
" if we ban these types of assault weapons , you are putting women at a great disadvantage			0
" other witnesses and senators who support tougher regulations countered that the constitutional right to bear arms can be limited , for example , by the existing ban on private citizens possessing grenade launchers and other military weaponry			1
why would someone own a military - style rifle ? " i think most people believe that , sure , we could have guards at schools , " @entity57 said , making a reference to the @entity319 , @entity320 , school massacre in 1999 in which two students killed 13 people before shooting themselves			2
" i 'm well aware that at @entity319 there was a deputy sheriff who was armed who actually took a shot but could n't hit the shooter there			2
the question comes , what do you do about the malls then ? what do you do about our movie theaters ? what do you do about businesses			0
we ca n't have a totally armed society			2
" the police chief of @entity343 in @entity344 , @entity342 , endorsed what he called the holistic approach urged by @entity29 to create a system that reduces access to guns for people who should n't have them			2
" the best way to stop a bad guy from getting a gun in the first place is a good background check , " said @entity342 , the chairman of the @entity352 to @entity353			1
however , @entity360 law professor @entity359 said the @entity361 made clear in a @entity0 , case that gun controls could not include weapons used commonly by law - abiding citizens , such as the top - selling @entity368 semi-automatic rifle that @entity57 's legislation would ban			2
@entity39 chief : @entity29 makes ' mockery ' of @entity5 freedoms the hearing showed agreement in concept on some issues , such as strengthening mental health screening			1
in general , though , it appeared to do little to create common ground on the issue			0
@entity89 said he hopes the committee will begin considering legislation next month			2
the @entity39 's membership has spiked by 500,000 people since the @entity132 shooting , bringing its number to more than 4.5 million , the group said wednesday			1
in the meantime , @entity69 and @entity4 have launched @entity390 to push for gun control			2
on tuesday , @entity69 said that despite the @entity393 , @entity394 , shooting that wounded his wife and killed six others , he and @entity4 still support the @entity106 , which guarantees @entity5 the right to possess firearms			0
" but we really need to do something about the safety of our kids and our communities			0
it 's gotten really out of hand , " he said			0
after wednesday 's hearing , @entity69 made a point of approaching @entity38 to shake his hand as media cameras recorded the moment			2
why new laws could miss @entity5 's bigger gun problem @entity1 's @entity413 and @entity414 contributed to this report .			2
