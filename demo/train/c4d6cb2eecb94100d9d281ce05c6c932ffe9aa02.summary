-- it 's just a newborn in planetary terms , and it 's drifting all alone in space without a star to orbit			1
the solitary life of this newly discovered planet , with the catchy name @entity10 , has astronomers excited			2
only 80 light - years from @entity13 , the 12 million - year - old planet has properties similar to those of gas - giant planets orbiting young stars			1
diamonds produced on other planets ? but because it is floating alone through space , rather than around a host star , astronomers can study it much more easily			1
" we have never before seen an object free - floating in space that looks like this , " said dr. @entity25 of the @entity26 at the @entity27 at @entity28 , who led the international team that discovered the planet			1
" it has all the characteristics of young planets found around other stars , but it is drifting out there all alone			2
i had often wondered if such solitary objects exist , and now we know they do			0
" stargazing in the desert : the magic of @entity45 's night skies while about a thousand planets have been discovered outside our solar system in the past decade by indirect means -- such as observing the wobbling or dimming of their host stars as they orbit -- only a handful of new planets have been directly imaged , all of them around young stars , according to a release from the @entity26			2
young stars are those less than 200 million years old			0
@entity10 's solitary existence and its similarity to those directly observed planets makes it a rare find			0
" planets found by direct imaging are incredibly hard to study , since they are right next to their much brighter host stars			0
@entity10 is not orbiting a star so it will be much easier for us to study , " said dr. @entity65 of the @entity66 in @entity67 and a co-author of the study			2
" it is going to provide a wonderful view into the inner workings of gas - giant planets like @entity77 shortly after their birth			1
" the astronomers stumbled across it as they sifted through a mountain of data produced by the @entity83 1 ( @entity83 ) wide - field survey telescope on @entity85 , @entity86			0
astronaut : real space travel much cooler than ' gravity ' the planet , which has only six times the mass of @entity77 , was identified by its faint and unique heat signature			1
the astronomers were actually searching for failed stars known as brown dwarfs when they came across @entity10 , which stood out because of its red color			0
subsequent infrared observations using other telescopes in @entity100 showed it was no brown dwarf , but rather a young , low - mass planet			1
by monitoring the planet 's position for the next two years , using the @entity106 , the team was able directly to measure its distance from @entity13			0
this means the astronomers have placed it within a collection of young stars called the @entity113 moving group that formed about 12 million years ago			0
the star that lends its name to the group , @entity113 , has another young gas - giant planet in orbit around it , the astronomers say			1
but @entity10 , which appears to be even lower in mass than that planet , continues to wend its solitary way through the universe , unattached to any star			2
newly found planets might support life			0

astronomers find a young , low - mass planet wandering through space alone
" we have never before seen an object free - floating in space that that looks like this , " one says
the planet will give an *insight* into the workings of young gas - giant planets like @entity77
it is easier to observe than other similar planets because it is not orbiting a young star
