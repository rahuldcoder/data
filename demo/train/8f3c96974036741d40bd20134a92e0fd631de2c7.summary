-- when clinging to life at sea , even a non-believer might be moved to pray for salvation			0
imagine their surprise then , when on the horizon they see not only a rescue vessel inspired by @entity10 , but @entity12 star @entity11			1
the glamorous actress was the unlikely guest at a naval base in @entity15 recently , meeting @entity17 refugees who had survived deadly boat journeys to @entity19			1
among them were a couple from @entity22 whose three children had died during the crossing , and a doctor from @entity29 whose wife and three - year - old daughter drowned			1
" we have to understand what drives people to take the fearful step of risking their children 's lives on crowded , unsafe vessels , " said @entity11 , the @entity30 of the @entity31 high commissioner for refugees			1
" it is the overwhelming desire to find refuge			0
" as conflict rages in the @entity44 , over 130,000 people have arrived in @entity19 by sea so far this year -- 2,500 of these dying while attempting to cross the @entity46 , according to the @entity47			1
@entity11 is not alone in her mission to save them			2
a wealthy philanthropist couple has backed her campaign , saying : " the world needs to wake up to the scale of this crisis			2
" now they 've put their money where their mouths are , launching a state - of - the - art rescue vessel -- inspired by the leader of the @entity60			1
sea savior introducing the " @entity62 , " a 40 - meter converted fishing trawler owned by @entity64 and @entity65 ; a couple describing themselves as " social entrepreneurs , " who make their money by running an insurance , emergency assistance , and intelligence company			1
digging deep into their own pockets , they are spending $ 445,000 each month on the ship 's operating costs			0
the boat has so far helped over 2,000 migrants crossing the @entity46 from @entity81 shores -- believed to be the first privately - funded vessel ever to do so			1
it follows the @entity10 's visit to the small island of @entity86 -- where 366 migrants died in shipwreck last year -- where he criticized the " global indifference " to the refugee crisis			1
just a few weeks ago another migrant boat sank carrying 500 people near @entity15 , in one of the worst wrecks in the region			1
" the words of the @entity10 , appealing to people to help with their skills , their ability , their free time -- we had to do something , " said @entity65 , originally from @entity97 and now living in @entity15 with her @entity99 husband and daughter			1
" when you see in the face of a seven - year - old child that they are safe on the boat -- there 's no price you can put on that			2
" while other ships celebrate their maiden voyage with a bottle of champagne , this hefty 483 - ton boat was launched with holy water sprinkled by a priest			2
" we are normal people that are wealthy , but we are far from millionaires , " said @entity65 , adding that the family choose to invest their money in human life , rather than making a profit			0
" it 's a lot of time , and a lot of energy			0
but our belief and our faith is the big push			0
" reality check the biggest wake - up call for the couple -- both in their 30s -- came while holidaying on board a luxury yacht in the @entity46 last summer			1
" i saw a winter jacket in the water , and i said to the captain , who is also a retired coast guard of @entity15 : ' look is n't it strange , ' " said @entity65			2
" and his face became very sad , and he told me : ' the person who was wearing this jacket is not with us anymore			0
' " the comment struck @entity159 like a lightning bolt -- " it was like ' boom ! ' " she said			0
" here we were in this nice boat , when the migrants , people like us , are attempting to cross because there 's a war in their country			2
" mission improbable ? if sending one boat to rescue hundreds of thousands of people seems @entity172 , the project -- called @entity174 ( @entity175 ) -- comes with serious credentials			1
director of operations , @entity177 , is the former chief of defense of the armed forces of @entity15 -- the body responsible for search - and - rescue in the area			1
along with a crew of 16 , including two paramedics , the boat is equipped with two high - tech drones , a medical clinic , 1,000 liters of water , hundreds of life jackets , and food			1
" the primary aim is to prevent the loss of life , not ferry migrants , " says the organization on its website			0
once at sea , the @entity62 sends out drones equipped with camcorders to search for migrant boats			0
the @entity175 team then reports back to the nearest authorities and awaits instructions and help			0
if necessary , it will offer life jackets , medical assistance , and evacuate refugees on board			0
captain @entity210 , spokesman for the @entity211 , would not comment on the merits of the @entity15 - based mission , saying : '' they are a resource but it 's not up to us to say if it 's an appropriate initiative			2
" the @entity15 government was unable to provide a comment on the @entity175 mission , despite numerous requests			2
after recently rescuing nearly 250 people -- including nearly 50 children -- from a leaking wooden boat , the @entity62 later transferred the migrants to an @entity97 navy ship , where they were taken to @entity97 and processed by authorities , they said in a statement " they were @entity17 and @entity232 , " said @entity177			1
" and talking to these people , one realizes they are fleeing from desperate times , " he said			0
" there were doctors , teachers on board			0
these are people who , had the situation been different , would never have left their country			0
" could a @entity12 star and " @entity242 " be the ones to save them ? perhaps ... but their efforts are a drop in a very big ocean			0
travel : is it a bird ... or a desert boat ? insight : inside @entity254 's $ 67m superyacht hotel			0
