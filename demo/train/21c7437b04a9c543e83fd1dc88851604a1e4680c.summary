-- who , exactly , owns your @entity3 account ? it 's a potentially complicated question when an account is used both professionally and personally			1
now a case regarding whether a @entity3 account belongs to a company or its former employee has raised questions about the use of the social media phenomenon			1
@entity14 , a website devoted to all things mobile products and services , sued former employee @entity19 for $ 340,000 , according to the complaint filed in @entity21 in the @entity22			1
the lawsuit , which was filed in july , alleges that @entity19 ' continued use of a @entity3 account he was " given use of " while employed with @entity14 was a misappropriation of trade secrets and damaged the company 's business , goodwill , and reputation			1
@entity19 was a product reviewer and video blogger for @entity14 for about four years , during which time he used the @entity3 account @ @entity35			1
the complaint states that @entity19 " used the account to disseminate information and promote @entity14 's services on behalf of @entity14			2
" but @entity19 told @entity0 he opened the account , linked it to his personal e-mail address and maintained it himself while tweeting both personal and professional things throughout his employment with @entity14 , including links to his own articles and colleagues ' articles , as well as tweets about sports , arts , and food			2
" it 's this melding of personal and professional which is why i 've gained a modest following , " @entity19 said			0
" because it 's not just the dry headline and link to something			0
" according to the complaint , @entity14 asked @entity19 to let go of the @entity3 account when he resigned in october 2010 , but instead of getting rid of it , he changed the handle to @ noahkravitz and continued to use and tweet under the account			1
@entity19 , who says he left on amicable terms , disputes this claim , saying @entity14 did not ask for the account back , but said it was ok if he kept the account and asked him to tweet from time to time on their behalf			2
" at no point until july of this year , a good 8 months after we parted ways , did they ask for the twitter account or claim in was their property			0
" @entity14 alleges @entity19 " is attempting to discredit @entity14 and destroy the confidence that @entity14 's users have in @entity14 " through continued use of the @entity3 account			1
in the course of @entity19 's employment , the @entity3 account garnered about 17,000 followers			1
the complaint states that according to industry standards , each follower is valued at about $ 2.50 per month , so incorporating that value , the 17,000 followers of the account , and the eight months since @entity19 resigned from @entity14 , the company arrived at the $ 340,000 claim			1
who really owns a @entity3 account ? @entity0 's @entity96 weighs in as social media accounts become increasingly relevant for employers , the line between personal and professional @entity3 accounts begins to blur , and a pair of intellectual property lawyers see new precedents on the horizon			1
" this is an issue with @entity3 , with @entity107 , with any of the social media sites where people have accounts and they 're using them for work purposes , " @entity105 told @entity0			2
" that ownership for those accounts is in play right now			0
" @entity113 noted that because @entity3 is relatively new , disputes that have come up have been settled			0
but he compared this case to situations in the past in which employees who left a company tried to take registered domain names with them but were not allowed			0
@entity113 said that if this one does go to a court decision , " it would certainly be a precedent out there			0
" asked whether or not he thinks a case like this has any merit , @entity105 said , " it 's going to boil down to whether he was paid to create ( the account ) for the company or not			0
" and he thinks @entity14 may have a chance at winning the case , " because they 've patched the arguments quickly			2
they said they hired him to create this feed for them -- that is the way the company could dislodge a @entity3 feed from its owner			0
" @entity19 , who is now editor - at - large for @entity140 , said he is starting to understand the magnitude of the situation			0
" this idea of what belongs to the employee , what belongs to the employers , where 's the influence coming from , what constitutes doing something on company time -- these lines are all really blurry right now			0
" neither @entity14 nor @entity3 responded to @entity0 's requests for comment .			2
