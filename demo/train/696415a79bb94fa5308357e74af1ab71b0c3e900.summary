more @entity1 aggression in @entity2			1
more @entity4 and @entity5 sanctions imposed on @entity6			0
what seems like diplomatic tail - chasing so many months into the @entity2 conflict invites questions about how @entity12 powers can defuse the worsening conflict in @entity14			0
@entity4 president @entity15 and the @entity16 raised the stakes on tuesday , announcing long - threatened sanctions that target @entity1 's state - owned banks , weapons makers and oil companies , along with top cronies of president @entity23			1
they want @entity23 to stop arming @entity26 separatists fighting the @entity2 government and instead support a political process that entrenches president @entity30 's elected leadership			0
a deeper concern is that @entity23 may be planning to grab more territory from the former @entity34 satellite following @entity1 's annexation of @entity36 earlier this year			2
@entity1 denies such ambitions and criticizes sanctions as unproductive , with the @entity39 saying wednesday that the new penalties will harm relations with the @entity4 and " create a poor environment in international affairs where the cooperation between our countries often plays a key role			1
" here is a look at the latest sanctions and what might come next			0
how did we get here ? the @entity2 crisis developed from huge protests in @entity55 late last year that led to the february ouster of @entity26 president @entity57			0
in the ensuing political chaos , the @entity58 got elected while @entity1 grabbed control of @entity36 , an ethnic - @entity1 territory home to its @entity62			2
@entity4 , @entity16 hit @entity1 with more sanctions as @entity2 fighting continues @entity15 and @entity4 allies protested by suspending @entity23 from the @entity66 and imposing a series of limited sanctions , warning of tougher measures targeting specific economic sectors if @entity1 's aggression continued			1
it did , with the separatists armed and trained by @entity6 rebelling in eastern @entity2			0
in response , @entity15 announced expanded @entity4 sanctions on july 16 that targeted two @entity1 state - owned banks , two energy companies , eight weapons makers , along with some @entity23 associates and separatist leaders			1
@entity14 's major economic ties with @entity1 -- about $ 500 billion in trade and investment per year -- caused the @entity16 to balk at joining @entity84 then			1
the next day , a missile fired from separatist - held territory downed a @entity89 jet in the conflict zone , killing all 298 people aboard			0
now the separatists are hindering access to the crash site amid fighting in the area , and @entity1 is sending heavy weaponry to them while deploying troops along the @entity2 border			2
@entity99 crash : investigators must have full access , @entity102 @entity101 says what the @entity16 did almost two weeks after @entity15 initially expanded the @entity4 sanctions , @entity5 leaders agreed tuesday to coordinate similar steps			1
in a major expansion signaling new resolve , they went after eight of @entity23 's top associates , along with @entity1 's finance , energy and weapons industries			2
the new @entity16 sanctions will restrict @entity1 state - owned banks from accessing @entity5 capital markets , and stop or slow the export of oil - related equipment and technology to @entity1			1
they also will stop new contracts for arms imports and exports between the @entity16 and @entity1 , and prohibit the export of goods and technology that can be used for both military and civilian purposes			1
" it is meant as a strong warning : illegal annexation of territory and deliberate destabilization of a neighboring sovereign country can not be accepted in 21st century @entity14 , " the @entity16 said in a statement			2
to punish @entity1 , @entity14 must be prepared to suffer what @entity15 announced two hours later , @entity15 told reporters that the @entity4 expanded its july 16 sanctions to include three more state - owned banks and another weapons company , while also targeting technology for deep - water , @entity145 and shale oil production			1
while expanding on the earlier moves , the latest sanctions include limits			0
they do n't affect @entity1 's current oil production , instead targeting the ability to develop new areas , senior administration officials told reporters on a background call			1
the @entity5 sanctions on weapons trade only involves future transactions , allowing @entity159 to complete an existing helicopter deal with @entity6			0
however , @entity15 cited the joint action as significant , saying that " because we are closely coordinating our actions with @entity14 , the sanctions we are announcing today will have an even bigger bite			1
" " if @entity1 continues on its current path , the cost on @entity1 will continue to grow , " he added , calling the moves " a reminder that the @entity4 means what it says , and we will rally the international community in standing up for the rights and freedom of people around the world			0
" what is the impact ? the senior administration officials said the expanded sanctions prevent @entity1 's state - owned banks , which have all or most of their debt in @entity4 dollars , from getting more medium - and long - term financing in @entity4			1
they noted the sanctions already have contributed to a downturn in the @entity1 economy , a flight of foreign capital and weakening of the ruble currency			1
" @entity1 is not a very good bet right now for international investors , " one of the officials said			0
on tuesday , shares in @entity197 oil giant @entity196 fell by 2.5 % after the company warned that it would suffer from the tougher @entity16 sanctions			1
@entity196 owns a significant stake in @entity201 , @entity1 's biggest oil company , which no longer can access long - term financing from @entity4 sources			1
meanwhile , shares in @entity159 automotive manufacturer @entity205 slumped by 4.5 % as the company warned about a sharp slowdown in emerging markets , including @entity1			0
@entity1 is @entity205 's third largest market , based on sales			0
geopolitically , @entity15 denied that a new @entity211 with @entity1 had started , but the head of the foreign affairs committee in @entity1 's @entity214 -- the lower house of parliament -- disagreed			1
@entity217 tweeted wednesday that @entity15 will make history as " the statesman who started a new @entity211			0
" to @entity221 , the editor of @entity223 magazine , the expanded sanctions mean that " the temperature in the room has just dropped a few degrees			1
" " the fact that the @entity5 have now finally recognized what they need to do and that the administration has been able to bring them on board " was a " positive development , " @entity226 told @entity232			0
map : @entity14 's thirst for @entity1 gas will it matter to @entity23 ? to the @entity4 officials , the sanctions announced tuesday are " the most significant tool we have to shape @entity1 decision - making			2
" analysts questioned whether economic hardship would change @entity23 's thinking			0
@entity243 , a former @entity4 ambassador to @entity2 now with the @entity244 , told a congressional committee last month that @entity23 could use sanctions " as a scapegoat and attempt to put all the blame on the @entity249 for @entity1 's poor economic performance			1
" to fellow @entity244 analysts @entity252 and @entity254 , @entity1 's economy can absorb the shocks of sanctions without deteriorating to the point of forcing @entity23 to change his overall goals and policies			2
" for that , sanctions would have to reduce @entity1 to its condition of the 1990s , when it was simply too weak and dependent on the @entity249 to oppose the international order created by the @entity249 after the @entity211 , " they wrote in an article on the @entity244 website			2
" it is clear to us that no feasible actions by the @entity249 today can recreate the weak and compliant @entity1 of the 1990s			0
" one reason : such a move would seriously harm the global economy , too , a step @entity84 and the @entity16 wo n't take , the pair said			1
opinion : @entity23 , just evil enough where do things stand ? @entity15 and @entity16 leaders made clear that @entity23 could avoid the increasing international isolation @entity1 faces by working with @entity30 's government in @entity2 , instead of helping the separatists fight against it			1
the senior administration officials listed four conditions for getting sanctions eased : recognize @entity30 's government as legitimately elected ; stop arming the separatists ; stop massing @entity1 forces at the border ; and influence the separatists to enter an inclusive political process in @entity2			2
" it did n't have to come to this			0
it does not have to be this way , " @entity15 said			0
" this is a choice that @entity1 and president @entity23 in particular has made			0
" the @entity5 statement specifically cited the annexation of @entity36 as another grievance , while the @entity4 officials did not mention it			0
however , @entity4 secretary of state @entity298 warned tuesday against any further expansionist ideas by @entity23 , such as invading eastern @entity2			0
" that would be taken , needless to say , as not just a violation of all notions of international law , but an exceedingly dangerous action which would wind up with , you know , the most severe possible kinds of isolation and sanctions possible , " @entity298 told reporters			0
" and @entity311 , @entity159 , other countries in @entity14 , would clearly join into that in ways that would have a profound , profound impact on the @entity1 economy			0
" sanctions : top 10 @entity1 targets what if the sanctions do n't work ? @entity15 and @entity5 leaders have repeatedly said the @entity2 crisis requires a diplomatic solution , which rules out military intervention -- at least for now			1
beyond sanctions , another idea floated by some @entity5 officials would be to move the 2018 soccer @entity328 planned for @entity1 to somewhere else			1
such a move , considered premature at this point by major soccer nations and organizations , would deliver a bitter blow to @entity23 following @entity1 's successful hosting of the @entity336 earlier this year			2
things to know about @entity1 and sanctions			2

@entity16 joins @entity15 after initially balking *due* to economic concerns
another possible option : take the 2018 soccer @entity328 from @entity1
