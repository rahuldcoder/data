-- @entity1 was driving past @entity3 's famous @entity2 in december when another vehicle abruptly cut him off			1
two men got out and shot @entity1 to death in front of his deaf daughter , whom he had just picked up from her school in @entity10			1
" people who live in the neighborhood and witnessed the shooting talked to my mother and sister and said that the shooters were sitting in the car , waiting , " said @entity1 's cousin @entity11			1
" the car was carrying @entity20 slogans , similar to the cars used by @entity3 intelligence			1
" @entity1 's family wondered whether he was targeted because another cousin , @entity24 , is a @entity26 - based @entity25 scholar who has spoken out against the regime of president @entity28			1
but that 's not the only possibility			2
5 reasons @entity3 's war suddenly looks more dangerous " even though the neighbors said the gunmen were pro-assad , the government told us terrorists killed him , " @entity33 said			1
and that says much about the plight of @entity3 's @entity43 community : a minority with many enemies , including an increasingly radicalized opposition that views them as outsiders and traitors and a desperate regime that questions their loyalty			1
the @entity52 minority that dominates the @entity28 regime is an offshoot of @entity43 , but few @entity3 @entity43 are among its inner circle			1
" the minorities in @entity10 , they are completely quiet ; they do n't want to side with any group			2
the minorities want nothing but to go to their place of worship and practice their faith			2
the @entity3 government views minorities , including @entity43 , @entity67 and @entity68 , as a buffer against the rebels , who in turn have tried to recruit from among these groups			1
but many within the rebels ' ranks are wary of the @entity43 , suspecting some may have links to the @entity78 militia @entity77 , whose fighters have begun appearing in @entity3 on the government 's side			1
" ( @entity43 ) end up being victims of a proxy war between rebels and the regime and are viewed with suspicion on both sides , " said @entity82 , a professor of @entity84 studies at @entity85			1
@entity82 says the @entity3 revolution descended into civil war because of the sectarian nature of the opposition 's rhetoric and its inability to control its sectarian tendencies			1
" the religious diversity of @entity3 was once a point of pride , so the destruction of this ideal has been catastrophic , " he said			1
the @entity105 's tale of horrors includes a niece and a nephew wounded in a car bomb blast , relatives turned refugees , assassinated cousins , kidnapped uncles and a family trapped by fear			1
" as my uncle left a funeral of a family who lost a teenage son , armed men took him and his sons by force from their car			2
my cousin who tried to resist was punched , " @entity11 says			2
@entity124 and his two adult sons were released after spending weeks as hostages of armed men claiming to be @entity128 rebels			2
the family , however , believes the kidnappers were actually government forces posing as rebels in a bid to threaten @entity24 , the @entity26 - based critic of the regime			1
two days after his release , the 65 - year - old father of four died of a heart attack			2
and it did n't end there			0
@entity140 announces more aid to @entity3 " on the @entity144 of 2013 , our cousin @entity142 was killed			1
he was heading back home with groceries where he lived in @entity147 in @entity10 suburbs when armed men approached and shot him dead			1
" the government told us that the terrorist killed @entity142 , and those terrorists want to kill all @entity3			1
@entity142 was not a member of the public committees or pro-government militias , he was as innocent as @entity161 , " @entity11 says referring to the fatal torture and mutilation of a 13 - year - old boy allegedly by @entity3 intelligence during the outset of the uprising			1
the atmosphere of chaos means many minorities simply can not know who or what group has attacked their loved ones and why			0
" you know , here in the @entity26 , we may ask , well , who did this ? but for the families in @entity3 , it does not matter anymore			1
all they do is try and follow the kidnappers demands so they can get their relative back			0
more than 1 million @entity3 are now registered refugees in neighboring countries			1
the @entity1 family longs to flee the violence but remains trapped in a capital under siege			2
" i 'm worried that the next target will be my mother or my sisters or my brother			0
i tried to get them out to @entity78 , but my mother is very sick and old ; she ca n't walk			0
" i try to call my family every two days to make sure everything is ok			2
but when i call , and they do n't answer , i think someone has broken into the house and taken them or something			0
@entity24 and @entity11 are @entity3 shiites of @entity198 origin			1
their family comes from a lower - class neighborhood in the @entity201 of @entity10			2
" in the @entity201 , we were close to different religions			0
we had @entity67 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity43			1
growing up there it was more like a communal and collective society			0
people were always visiting each other , so there were strong ties between the families			0
the brothers and their two sisters grew up in poverty during the secular regime of @entity218			2
members of his minority @entity52 group were given top government and military positions , but @entity28 cultivated other minorities as a counterweight to the @entity205 majority			1
dissent of any sort was not tolerated			0
while @entity218 ruled @entity3 , the @entity1 brothers ' father was detained and tortured by @entity3 security forces for his involvement in a human rights campaign			1
@entity24 eventually escaped the crushing poverty and oppression , receiving a @entity237 teaching scholarship in the @entity26			0
@entity11 remained in @entity10 , quitting school by second grade to support his family by selling memorabilia and tea to tourists			2
when @entity218 's @entity245 - educated son @entity244 succeeded him in 2000 , @entity3 hoped for political and economic reforms			1
they never materialized , and in march 2011 came the first protests against the regime			2
six months later , a radical @entity205 preacher issued dire threats against minority groups that did not support the uprising			0
" by @entity258 we will chop up their flesh and feed them to the dogs , " @entity253 said in one of his inflammatory broadcasts on satellite station @entity256			0
as the civil war enters its third year , it is no longer a simple case of regime against rebels			1
there are overlapping and intersecting loyalties , foreign fighters and criminals taking advantage of chaos			0
" mounting tensions have led to armed clashes between different armed groups along a sectarian divide			0
such incidents took place in mixed communities or where armed groups had attempted to take hold of areas predominantly inhabited by @entity284 minority communities			0
" a recent @entity286 report concluded			0
" the people are being very cautious of all different groups			0
they are afraid of all groups			0
they are afraid of any group outside their home			0
" the minorities are scared because there are a lot of rumors that there are some extremist radical @entity205 groups			0
they believe that they have distributed fliers saying if you kill one person from a minority , we will pay 100,000 @entity304 , and there are videos where they mutilate the person			0
" " the general view is very pessimistic for the minorities ; the ones who can are leaving			0
they are immigrating to @entity315 countries			0
what they hope is that the opposition and @entity28 can reach an agreement			1
they do n't care about the political structure			0
they just want the violence to stop , " @entity24 adds			0
but there is every sign that the violence is becoming more sectarian and even more vicious			0
earlier this year , fighters from the @entity205 jihadist group @entity327 , designated a terrorist organization by the @entity26 sang " just wait @entity329			0
we will come to slaughter you			0
forget about any agreement ... we will come to slaughter you , @entity43			1
" the @entity1 family clings to the hope that a political solution can be found			2
" i believe that most of the @entity3 do not want to see violence in their homeland , and they want the safety and security to be back like it used to be			1
i do n't get involved in politics and i do n't want to			0
i want a normal life in @entity3 , and just want to live in peace , " @entity11 says .			2

@entity43 family in @entity3 has endured attacks from all sides in civil war
one cousin was shot dead in front of his daughter ; others held hostage
it 's unclear whether attackers were with the @entity28 regime or the rebels
neither the government nor the rebels trust @entity43 in @entity3
