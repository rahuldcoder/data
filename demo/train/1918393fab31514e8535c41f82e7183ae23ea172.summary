@entity0 -- police are to investigate claims that the @entity6 secret services were involved in the rendition of two men to @entity9 and their alleged ill treatment there , @entity0 's @entity2 said thursday			1
the investigation will take place now rather than at the end of a government inquiry into allegations of @entity6 involvement in abuse of detainees , the police said in a joint statement with prosecutors			2
one of the cases involves @entity24 , a former leader of the @entity25 who became a senior revolutionary commander , while the second is @entity9 citizen @entity28 , officials confirmed			1
" the allegations raised in the two specific cases concerning the alleged rendition of named individuals to @entity9 and the alleged ill - treatment of them in @entity9 are so serious that it is in the public interest for them to be investigated now rather than at the conclusion of the @entity39 , " the @entity2 said in a joint statement with the director of public prosecutions			2
@entity40 , chief of the @entity6 foreign intelligence agency @entity41 , welcomed the decision in a statement thursday			1
" we will of course be cooperating fully with the police on this new investigation , as we have done on the one now concluding , " @entity40 said			2
" it is in the service 's interest to deal with the allegations being made as swiftly as possible so we can draw a line under them and focus on the crucial work we face now and in the future			0
" a statement from the @entity56 said the government would also cooperate fully			1
" the government stands firmly against torture and cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment , " it said			1
" we do not condone it , nor do we ask others to do it on our behalf			0
the security and intelligence agencies work tirelessly to protect us day in , day out			0
" the @entity39 , to be headed by @entity69 , was ordered by prime minister @entity70 in 2010 but can not start until all related criminal investigations have been concluded , meaning it may be further delayed by thursday 's decision			0
the inquiry 's remit is " to look systematically at the allegations about whether @entity6 personnel were in any way involved in the alleged mistreatment of detainees held by other countries , " following the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on the @entity84 , its website says			2
last september it confirmed it would look into the claims of @entity6 involvement in renditions to @entity9			1
@entity89 , director of the legal action charity @entity90 , also welcomed thursday 's decision by police and prosecutors			0
their statement made clear that " @entity6 complicity in the torture of @entity9 @entity99 and @entity100 by the @entity102 regime is so blatant that a criminal inquiry must go ahead before the government 's deeply flawed @entity104 can get started , " he said			1
@entity106 , also known as @entity107 , is suing the @entity6 government and intelligence agencies for their alleged complicity in his rendition from @entity112 to @entity113 in 2004 and subsequent inhuman detention , torture and abuse by the @entity9 authorities , according to a letter from his lawyers placed online by @entity90			1
documents found at @entity9 intelligence headquarters in @entity113 by campaign group @entity122 last september highlighted the cooperation between @entity9 and @entity125 intelligence agencies after @entity9 ended its weapons of mass destruction program in 2004			2
@entity1 saw an exchange of information between @entity9 intelligence and @entity125 intelligence agencies -- such as the @entity132 , the @entity41 in @entity6 and @entity134 's intelligence service -- in documents dating from 2004 and 2005			1
they included a march 6 , 2004 , @entity132 letter to @entity9 officials concerning @entity24			1
@entity6 police and prosecutors also said they would not charge any individuals in relation to allegations of wrongdoing by @entity6 officials in two separate investigations , in their statement thursday			1
one , known as @entity147 , relates to claims that @entity6 intelligence officials were involved in the ill - treatment and torture of @entity151 , an @entity152 - born @entity6 resident and former @entity154 inmate , while he was detained in @entity155			1
the other , @entity156 , was set up to investigate possible criminal wrongdoing after an individual who was detained by @entity84 authorities in @entity160 was questioned by a member of the @entity41 , or @entity41			0
neither investigation produced evidence that would have led to a criminal conviction of an individual , the police and prosecutors concluded			0
but , they added , " nothing in this decision should be read as concluding that the ill - treatment alleged by mr @entity151 did not take place or that it was lawful			0
" @entity89 welcomed that statement as " the first time any official in any country has conceded that @entity151 was tortured -- and it is clear from this statement that the @entity179 accepts that mr @entity151 was tortured and it was a criminal offense			0
" it was unsurprising that the authorities had not found evidence to prosecute an individual in the case , he said			0
" but the main focus of all this should not be the rank and file , but those who were signing off the torture policy at the top , " he added , naming former prime minister @entity190 among them			0
the police and cps have also agreed to set up a panel to look into other claims of ill treatment of detainees and determine whether they should be investigated before the @entity39 concludes , thursday 's statement said			2
@entity1 's @entity201 contributed to this report .			0
