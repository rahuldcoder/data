-- as we head into @entity3 , i wanted to reveal a little secret for all the fathers who are doing their best to be great dads and great men			1
i 'm the single mother of a wonderful 9 - year - old son			1
at 46 , i 've learned more about men from being his mother than i ever learned throughout decades of dating , marriage , divorce , engagement and a broken engagement			1
we talk about everything under the sun. the authenticity with which his boyhood exhibits itself constantly keeps me on my toes as often as he keeps me laughing			0
i thought i knew everything , but by watching my son 's perspective on life -- he does n't hide anything -- i learn more about the male species			1
in his innocence , he breaks it down better than 100 hours of @entity32 can			0
for instance : @entity34 , why are your legs so hairy ? lesson no. 1 : men like it when women maintain their looks whenever i 'm burning the candle at both ends , my son reminds me to take care of myself			1
the first time he noticed my hairy legs was the first time i realized i had let my personal grooming go a little too much			1
as a fashion expert , my image is usually rather polished and stylish -- in public			2
however , in private , when i get home the first thing i do is i take off my bra and change into cozy sweats and a t - shirt			2
if it 's winter and my legs are hidden ( and i 'm not dating anyone ) , i confess that i often forget to shave			0
only my son and i know that i let the hair on my legs grow a liiiiittle tooooo loooong when it 's disguised under pants during the winter			2
when he notices , i know it 's time to remind myself to maintain my self - esteem for myself ... and my man			1
your legs are so pretty , why do n't you wear more dresses ? lesson no. 2 : men love it when women wear dresses nothing humbles this fashionista more than when my son asks me to wear dresses more often			1
i only wear dresses if i 'm attending special evening events , so his eyes light up whenever i step out in a dress			0
i 've been blessed with my mother 's and grandmother 's pretty legs			0
i rarely used to show them off			0
now i do -- because my son reminds me that i should			1
sometimes boys do crazy things , @entity91 no. 3 : sometimes men do crazy things the other day i heard a thumping noise coming from my son 's bathroom			1
he was using the toilet plunger to create what he called " cool sounds " on the wall			0
i was openly annoyed at him for spreading germs on the wall			0
he was tasked with wiping the wall down with antibacterial wipes			0
after he finished he said , " i 'm sorry			0
i know it did n't make any sense			0
but it was fun ! sometimes boys do crazy things , @entity91 , " to which i replied , " you 're right ! " i all could do was hug him and smile			1
when can i have a play date ? lesson no. 4 : men behave better when they 're allowed to play to all you smothering women out there			1
" stop ! " my son gets ants in his pants on rainy days			2
he pouts , he gets moody and irritable whenever he ca n't release his male energy			0
he thrives whenever he plays with other boys			2
i would rather be a golf widow than stress over my man 's whereabouts			0
cars , sports , bars , smartphones , computers , techy stuff and video games			0
these are just toys for big boys			2
if your man needs time to hang out with the boys , do n't try to stop him			1
if you encourage him to go outside and play , he 'll come home even faster when the streetlights come on			2
no matter how old they are , men will always be boys at heart			1
i 'm a big boy now mommy ! lesson no. 5 : men will always be boys , but they want a woman to treat them like a man my son loves it when i treat him like a big boy , and i let him do big boy stuff with other boys			1
even little boys want to be treated like big boys			2
if i had a dollar for every time i unknowingly emasculated a man ( before i learned better from my son ) , i would be a gazillionaire			1
i grew up assuming i had to work as hard as a man if i wanted to lead a successful life			0
i thought that meant i also had to lead men in my personal life			0
if i had known better , i would have let my man wear the pants while i led him in a dress			0
now i wear more dresses than ever ... and i shave my legs , too			0
opinion : son , this is how to be a man opinion : my dad gave me life - twice when is ' @entity178 ' more than @entity179 ? join us on @entity182 / @entity181 .			1

@entity184 laughs at the things she has learned about men from her young son
the lessons span *generations* -- from taking care of herself to allowing men time to play
and sometimes , her 9 - year - old son tells her , " boys do crazy things , @entity91 "
