-- for hours at a time , ronaldo @entity1 pedals on a stationary bike for a cause			2
but it is not an ordinary bike , nor an ordinary cause			0
@entity8 is an inmate at the prison in @entity10 do @entity11 , @entity12 , near @entity13			1
he is among a small group of inmates who have been given the chance to lower their sentences by exercising on customized stationary bikes attached to car batteries that charge as they pedal			1
the batteries are in turn used to power street lights in the local plaza			0
the program exists only at this one prison , but is not the only recent effort at out - of - the - box thinking in @entity12 's penal system			1
@entity30 , a judge in @entity10 do @entity11 , came up with the idea for the pedaling program while doing internet searches for cost - free , clean energy sources			1
it was a personal curiosity , he said , and it led him to a story about an @entity38 gym that is partly powered by its patrons ' bicycle workouts			0
in his small city , it was easy to adapt the idea and put it in practice with the local prison , he said			1
the program provides a type of poetic justice , he said			0
most inmates at some point deprived a sense of security from their victims			2
now , by providing clean energy that powers the city 's plaza at night , they are providing a sense of security			1
" this has been very well received			0
we are very satisfied with the public reaction , " @entity30 said			0
@entity12 's prisons , by and large , are overcrowded and unpleasant places			1
according to the ministry of justice , @entity12 's prisons are at 167 % of capacity , as of december 2011			1
the prison population has more than doubled since 2001			2
but new initiatives are finding creative ways to address these issues while helping inmates and society at the same time			1
another recent program -- this one at the federal level -- allows inmates to reduce their sentence for reading books			1
the idea is to help inmates be better prepared for success when they reintegrate with the outside world			2
inmates can shave four days off their sentence through each book they read , up to 48 days per year , the new law states			1
the " @entity86 " program , as it 's known , requires the inmates to write a book report			2
the law goes as far as to specify that these reports must be written neatly and must not stray from the topic of the book			0
the books available to inmates will include literary classics and scientific and philosophical tomes , among others			1
" there is very alarming crisis in the penal system , " said @entity98 , a @entity12 professor and expert on criminal law			1
" proposals like this , which reduce sentences and give a social and cultural foundation to people are very interesting			1
" the reading program addresses the overcrowding problem and gives inmates a cultural foundation , he said			1
@entity114 is an important tool because a large percentage of @entity12 prisoners come from poor backgrounds and have little education			1
nearly half of @entity12 inmates -- 46 % -- have not completed more than nine years of basic education , according to the ministry of justice			1
more than 26,000 prisoners ( 5 % ) are illiterate			2
the new law gives inmates something to do , and better prepares them for then they reintegrate with society , @entity98 said			0
" it is a necessary measure given the prison crisis in @entity12 , " he said			1
the program has existed for several years , but was codified into the law just last month			0
it is a " pioneering " initiative , @entity98 said , but would have much greater impact if it were imposed on all prisons , not just the federal ones , which hold just a fraction of the country 's inmates			2
in @entity10 do @entity139 , @entity30 says he has bigger dreams than having inmates powering street lamps			0
he envisions a system where the battery power is converted into electricity that can be used to power houses			0
in the short term , the goal is to power the city 's entire plaza with clean energy produced by the prisoners			1
currently , there are four bicycles that require 10 hours of pedaling to fully charge one battery			0
the energy is enough to power 10 street lamps , out of 34 lamps that provide light for the plaza			0
authorities hope to expand the number of bikes to 10 in the near future , @entity30 said			0
for every 16 hours of pedaling , inmates have their sentences reduced by one day , with no maximum on how much they can bike , he said			2
@entity8 , the inmate at the @entity10 do @entity11 prison , said at first the prison population did n't know what to make of the stationary bicycles , but estimates that now , some 80 % of prisoners want to participate			2
" i started to learn more about the project and only then i understood how important it is for the city , " he said			0
for now , there are two teams of four inmates who were chosen to participate , based on their good behavior			0
" the project is very good for the prisoners , it shows the good they can do , " he said			0
@entity8 is serving a five - and - a - half year sentence for assault , and has erased 20 days off his punishment since he began pedaling two months ago , he said			0
the 36 - year - old said that the time on the bike also gives him time to reflect on his situation			0
while he 's pedaling , " i think about my imprisonment , about my freedom , my wife , my kids , " he said .			0

new *alternatives* to reduce prison sentences in @entity12 have emerged
in one city , inmates can pedal bikes that produce clean energy
at federal level , prisoners can read books to shorten jail time
programs address prison overcrowding and help inmates
