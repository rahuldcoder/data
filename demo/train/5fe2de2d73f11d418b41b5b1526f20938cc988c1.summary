@entity0 , @entity1 -- the town of @entity0 lies two hours north of @entity4 , @entity1			1
makeshift tents dot a hillside there , flimsy shelters made of sheets and coconut branches that are a respite from the sun , but no match for the recent torrent of rains that wash down rotting bodies from a nearby slope			2
at night , the lights from aid camps and surrounding areas do not reach here			2
it is not the first time @entity25 , 18 , has seen hell			1
a few years ago , the @entity1 teen was forging a new future after doctors removed a massive tumor - like growth that had taken over her face , threatening her life and forcing her into mortified seclusion			1
she was making her way back into the world and smiling again			2
today that future , like those of countless other @entity1 children with chronic health issues , is threatened by fractures in the country 's already weak health care system			1
if @entity25 's name sounds familiar , it 's because her story was featured in a 2004 @entity47 special			1
in 2009 , a follow - up episode chronicled her ongoing progress			2
@entity25 suffered from polyostic fibrous dysplasia , a genetic disorder that causes bone tissue to degenerate and form a tumor - like mass. the tumor had consumed @entity25 's life so wholly , her family contacted the @entity57 in @entity58 , @entity59			1
@entity60 , which is affiliated with @entity61 , sponsors critically ill children from @entity63 and the @entity64			1
they agreed to take her case , and over the course of a year , doctors removed the 14 - pound tumor and reconstructed @entity25 's nose , jaw and lips			1
after several grueling surgeries , the face that had been rendered so unrecognizable bore the warmth of a familiar pair of brown eyes -- and a smile			1
" when she was sick , we were so worried , " said @entity78 , @entity25 's sister			1
" she grew big and big , we were so sad and upset about that			2
but after surgery , she looked better			2
she does n't want to kill herself			2
" the procedures reversed years of suffering and reclusiveness for @entity25 , a change the family says affected far more than her face			1
" she felt good , " @entity78 said			2
" all of the family feels good when @entity25 feels good			0
" six years later , as death rumbled through the streets of @entity4 , @entity25 faced the worst once again			1
" all of the children were studying when it happened , " said @entity78			1
" @entity25 was with me			0
when we felt the quake , we went , and @entity25 fell			0
i remember that she cried a lot that day			0
" with the family gathered in the front yard , the tremors struck and their house crumbled to the ground			0
an aunt who was sleeping at the time of the quake died inside the home			0
although the story of their survival may seem miraculous , @entity25 and her family now face a suffocating new reality			1
@entity25 's mother , @entity110 , said they have no electricity and limited access to food			1
" the situation is so bad , very bad for us , because we have lost something very big for the @entity1 people , " said @entity110			1
" we have no house , no food , no city			0
" the people in their tattered , makeshift town are bitten raw by mosquitoes , bees and giant spiders			0
gunshots ring out in the night and the stench of rotting bodies is a constant reminder of the fate @entity25 's family narrowly managed to escape			1
@entity133 , a nurse for @entity57 , said young girls are left to wander the streets unprotected , and rape is a constant and heavy threat			1
" it is hell , " she said			1
" all i can tell you , this is no life			1
no human wants to live like this			0
" in addition , @entity57 's efforts to get @entity25 to @entity58 for further care have been stalled			1
important documents were lost in the rubble of the family 's ruined house , and without them , @entity25 can not leave			2
with the country in chaos , getting new visas or medical parole seems to be out of the question			0
@entity57 director @entity157 said the recent controversy surrounding a group of @entity161 missionaries accused of child trafficking has left people unwilling to transport children for fear of legal action			2
" there are no answers for anybody , " she said			0
" i have people that will bring @entity25 over , but everybody 's scared that they 're going to be charged with kidnapping			2
everybody is just running into walls			0
they see these kids dying every day , but nobody will risk bringing them over			0
" the staggering truth is @entity25 is just one of the scores of @entity1 children @entity57 and other organizations are scrambling to save			1
@entity157 said nearly 30 of their kids are stranded in @entity1 waiting for help , and there are countless more who could be endangered by lack of care for otherwise treatable conditions			1
she said her organization already has lost one child , a 4 - year - old boy who had recently undergone open - heart surgery			0
he died after suffering a heart attack during an aftershock			0
" all of these organizations have launched these campaigns , they have the money , the hospitals have stepped up , but they ca n't reach them , " @entity157 said			0
" it is absolutely mind - boggling			0
every single doctor , every single volunteer , every single person of leadership , nobody knows what to do			0
" despite the recent earthquake in @entity212 and the threat of waning public concern , it is clear the struggle in @entity1 is far from over			1
@entity25 's mother and sister said it is hard to find hope among the ruins			2
" we are in trouble now , " @entity78 said			0
" we do n't know what to do			0
we do n't know what we can do			0
@entity25 is ok , but she does n't feel good because she is upset about so many things			0
" when asked what the future may hold , @entity110 was at a loss for words			0
" i lost everything , " she said			0
" i just ask for @entity232 to have some help for my family			0
