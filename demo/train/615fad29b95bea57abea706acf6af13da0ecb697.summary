@entity0 -- @entity2 may be the latest political pi√±ata in @entity0 these days , but -- policy aside -- there may be another reason he is the one fellow everyone is picking on at @entity8 : he 's there alone			1
president @entity11 's ethics code requires that no lobbyist can work for an agency he may have lobbied			1
believe it or not , @entity2 is the only confirmed official at his department			2
some top nominees , even those who have served in government before , have decided to withdraw			2
others are still pending as they go through arduous background checks that one pro-obama @entity20 calls " maddening vetting hell			0
" sure , this is about extensive scrutiny to make sure no one has a tax problem after @entity2 's own embarrassing unpaid tax bill			2
but the staffing problem is not just at @entity8 , and it goes way beyond the time - consuming nature of extensive background checks			1
it 's also about overreaching anti-lobbyist rules			1
he 's the advocacy director for @entity34 , an expert on genocide and torture			2
but when it came time for a top human rights job at the @entity40 , he was turned away			0
why ? " because he lobbied against torture , " says one incredulous administration official			1
" but the rules are the rules : the ethics code requires that no lobbyist can be hired to work for an agency he may have lobbied			2
so , just to clarify : someone like @entity33 who lobbied against torture and is a widely acknowledged expert on international human rights law is , er , blackballed			0
more to the point , he was shown the door precisely because he tried to influence @entity54 on an issue that both he and the administration agree , and care deeply about			2
( @entity33 wo n't comment			2
) only in the @entity58 world of @entity0 would this make any sense			0
and it still does n't			2
it 's just a prime instance of the problems that can arise when great - sounding ( theoretical ) campaign one - liners rub up against the ( real ) difficulties of trying to staff a government			1
in other words , the short - term interest in demonizing all lobbyists has led to some very difficult staffing problems			1
so , if you 're an environmental expert and lobbyist , forget about the @entity72			0
but you might want to think about some work in the health field			0
that is , unless someone says you 're a lucky exception ! they 're rare , but @entity79 is one			0
he 's a top defense department appointee who once worked as a lobbyist for @entity81 , a military contractor			0
the @entity82 says that ( a ) it has n't had much trouble staffing the government and ( b ) is willing to make reasonable exceptions			1
so far we have only seen a handful			0
the problem has made it difficult to operate at every department			0
" a lot of good people just ca n't go into government , " says one administration official			1
" it 's a huge departure from the spirit of what they wanted			0
" indeed , he adds , here 's an unintended consequence : " we 're setting up a system where the only people who qualify to work in government are the ones who never actually left government			1
so instead of getting the best and the brightest from finance and elsewhere , we 're recycling some folks from @entity111			0
not that they 're unqualified , but the administration needs input from multiple sources -- outside of @entity0			0
on top of that , the @entity8 has another public relations problem : the appointment of anyone with any tie to a bank that has been bailed out or any institution that is tied to the mortgage mess is a non-starter			0
no wonder it 's hard to find the experts			0
yet much of this problem is self - inflicted			0
the no - lobbyist rule could have been " softened " to exclude nonprofit lobbyists			1
the administration decided against that , one senior official tells me			1
" we did n't want to label people as ' good lobbyists ' or ' bad lobbyists			1
' " besides , he adds , " we think we are flexible			0
" that 's not the feeling you get speaking with either those jumping hoops to try to get into government and those who have been turned away			1
as the administration faces its huge economic crisis , it needs all hands on deck			1
after all , you ca n't rebuild public confidence in a government if you do n't have one .			1

@entity11 's overreaching anti-lobbyist rules *interfere* with governing , @entity155 says
short - term interest in demonizing all lobbyists leads to staffing problems , she says
" a lot of good people just ca n't get into government , " says one administration official
administration needs all hands on deck during this financial crisis , @entity155 says
