-- it 's become as much an integral part of the annual golfing calendar as any tournament			2
every year in the week of the @entity4 at @entity5 , a select few are inducted to @entity8 's @entity7 ( @entity9 )			1
but the 2013 ceremony on may 6 is not without a degree of controversy -- thanks to the caustic observations of one of the @entity7 's very own			1
members are elected in five different categories -- principally the @entity19 ballot and the international ballot -- for players who compete outside the @entity23 circuit			1
the criteria for getting on the ballot takes into account how many tournaments you have won -- with extra credit given for the four majors and the @entity31 tournament , which is often dubbed the ' fifth major			0
" but in the view of @entity23 golfer @entity35 -- a four time major winner elected to the @entity7 in the 1980s -- it has become a club that is too easy to join			1
@entity37 in an interview with @entity41 the straight talking former @entity39 captain let rip : " the bar has been lowered			0
guys get voted into the @entity7 who do n't belong , who lack the numbers			1
i 'm very upset at the @entity7 for that			1
it 's not fair to the people who went in early			2
" " just look at the inductees over the last six , eight , 10 years , " @entity35 added			1
" some years , i do n't even vote because the names are not worthy of induction			0
one major should not get you into the @entity7 -- maybe one major and 40 wins			1
" " i 'll just say that you should have at least two majors			0
at least , " he explained			0
" wow , there are guys in there that it 's a joke			2
it takes integrity away from the term @entity7 , " he added			1
@entity35 did not name names -- but few doubted he was targeting two of this year 's intake -- @entity70 and @entity71			1
couples only won one major - the @entity73 in 1992			0
@entity71 famously won none , coming second five times			1
a giant on the @entity78 and in the @entity39 , the @entity76 never managed to grab one of the prizes all his peers strive for			0
@entity83 defense the @entity9 chief operating officer , @entity84 , told @entity0 's @entity85 that he welcomed an honest exchange of views of the merits or otherwise of inductees			1
" we love the debate , " he said with a smile			0
" it 's an election that we administer and it 's a bit of a ' let the chips fall where they may ' in terms of who gets elected			2
" but he 's quick to firmly defend this year 's choices , including the major-less @entity99 : " what @entity71 's body of work has done for the @entity78 , for the game in @entity106 , his contribution to the @entity39 -- it 's extraordinary			1
" and i do n't think because he has not won majors precludes him from the @entity7			1
we want to celebrate the game			0
we want to recognize greatness			0
" it 's possible the controversy could build in years to come			2
there are several star players -- @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 -- who still ca n't win one of the four majors			0
lively debate and yet some other major winners in recent years -- @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 -- have won only a handful of other tournaments			0
but if debate stirs interest , @entity84 is happy			0
" we administer the ballot			0
should it be more strict -- maybe ; should it be less strict -- maybe			0
there 's a number of scenarios here that you could put together to do this , but were pretty comfortable with where we are			2
" it is about fame , it 's a vote , and he got the votes			2
should he have more wins , less wins , i leave that to you guys in the media " @entity71 and @entity70 are joined in the @entity7 this year by former @entity152 champion and broadcaster @entity151 ; @entity154 , the previous head of the @entity78 , as well as the course designer @entity155 , a @entity156 champion from the 19th century			1
who knows what he would have made of it all .			0
