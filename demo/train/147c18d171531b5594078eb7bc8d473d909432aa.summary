-- @entity1 was a bit of a novelty when he burst on the music scene in 1999 with his major - label debut album , " the @entity6			1
" one of the highest - profile white rappers not only to have major crossover success but also street cred , the artist born @entity1 no longer has to deal as much with the issue of race in a music genre dominated by @entity16 men			1
instead , he is grappling with issues regarding another minority group			2
" i poke fun at other people , myself , " @entity1 recently told @entity20 magazine about using a slur against gay people in his rhymes			1
" but the real me sitting here right now talking to you has no issues with gay , straight , transgender , at all			2
" the rapper has always courted controversy , and it 's not the first time he 's attracted attention for gay epithets in his music			1
@entity1 now is feeling the heat for the not at all gay friendly lyrics in " @entity40 " from his eighth solo album , " the @entity41 , " which came out tuesday			1
a sequel to his hit 2000 album , " the @entity41 , " the latest project is garnering some critical acclaim			1
consequence of sound writer @entity46 notes in a @entity49 piece that " @entity1 does n't have that center - of - the - universe pull these days , nor could he or anyone else have expected ' @entity41 ' to yield the results of its alpha			1
" " but , this one 's nostalgic in all the right ways , a worthy look back at the lp that made him the world 's most popular cult figure , " he writes			2
" and , since we still have n't found an inheritor to his madness , this version of @entity1 is more than welcome			1
" in reviewing the album , @entity68 's @entity67 gave it 3Â½ stars out of 4 , saying , " on ' the @entity41 , ' he recaptures the original release 's wild , clever , emotional brilliance in a flurry of caustic , brazenly honest , rapid - fire rhymes and aggressive beats			1
so what 's the problem ? once the bravest visionary in rap 's underworld , @entity1 spends much of ' @entity41 ' gazing into the past , reworking early tricks and wading in nostalgia rather than forging a fresh path			1
" @entity1 returns to hip - hop at an interesting time			1
two of its biggest stars , @entity85 and @entity88 , are known as much for their high - profile relationships ( to @entity90 and @entity91 , respectively ) and roles as fathers as they are for their music			0
and the new rising stars include the likes of @entity97 , who is making a name for himself basically by dissing everyone			0
it 's an era where music artists strive to be shocking ( @entity103 , anyone ? ) while still in fear of running afoul of the political correctness police			2
sober after an addiction to prescription drugs he told @entity0 almost killed him and the father of a teen daughter , @entity1 , now 41 , has also grown			1
the new album is a follow - up to a different time in his life , but it remains as personal as his past projects			2
" i always say this about my music , and music in general : music is like a time capsule , " he told @entity123			0
" each album reflects what i 'm going through or what 's going on in my life at that moment			1
" he told the magazine he is unsure of where he fits into today 's musical landscape			2
" i struggle with that sometimes , " @entity1 said			1
" i guess it 's more about where people see me , and where people feel like i fit in			2
hopefully when all is said and done , people see me as just an mc			0
" these days there are a plethora of white rappers that can thank @entity1 for further opening the door to the genre			2
artists such as @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 are now hip - hop mainstays			0
when @entity166 rapper @entity165 recently criticized the latter during an interview ( " okay , white rappers , you 're coming to this almost as a guest			0
okay , matter of fact you are guests in the house of @entity161			0
just because you have a hit record does n't give you the right as i feel to voice your opinion			0
" ) , others condemned the comments			0
" i mean as far as white people rapping , who gives a f * * k , " said actor / comedian @entity169 to @entity170			0
" is it f * * * in ' up yo money ? no. " rapper @entity151 offers an interesting counterpoint to @entity1 's new single given that the former 's anthem to gay equality , " @entity180 , " has become a hit			1
when @entity20 writer @entity186 recently questioned @entity1 as to " why , in 2013 , use ' f * * got ' on that song ( ' @entity40 ' ) " and " why use ' gay - looking ' as an insult " given that he has gone out of his way to say he has no problem with the gay community , the rapper attributed it to his hip - hop persona			1
" i do n't know how to say this without saying it how i 've said it a million times , " he said			0
" but that word , those kind of words , when i came up battle - rappin ' or whatever , i never really equated those words			0
... " to being a homosexual , @entity186 asked ? " yeah , " he said			0
" it was more like calling someone a b * * ch or a punk or a * * hole			0
so that word was just thrown around so freely back then			0
it goes back to that battle , back and forth in my head , of wanting to feel free to say what i want to say , and then ( worrying about ) what may or may not affect people			0
