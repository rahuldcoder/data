the apocryphal and numerically fluctuating line about the @entity1 , often attributed to @entity2 , is that just 3,000 people bought " @entity4 , " but every one of them formed a band			1
it was n't true -- the 1967 album sold more than 50,000 copies in its first two years of release -- but the influence of the album is inescapable			2
the @entity12 were precursors to punk rock , art rock , avant - garde rock , almost any kind of rock that veered from the status quo			1
and , not to discount the contributions of @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and the soon - to - depart @entity24 , but the voice of the band was @entity27			1
the singer , guitarist and songwriter died sunday , according to his publicist			1
he had undergone a liver transplant in may			2
the @entity1 brought a thrilling dose of downtown noise and crudeness to a rock scene that was beginning to take its love - and - peace feelings all too seriously			1
@entity27 's songs , such as " @entity39 " ( whose narrator traveled to @entity41 to meet his dealer ) , " @entity46 " ( about a sadomasochistic relationship ) and " @entity49 " ( self - explanatory ) , were journeys into humanity 's dark side			1
@entity27 wrote or co-wrote every song on that first album and expanded his songwriting expertise on the @entity1 's later works : the even rawer " @entity53 " ( 1968 ) ; the quiet , sometimes brooding , occasionally ecstatic " @entity4 " ( 1969 ) ; the pop - directed " loaded " ( 1970 ) ; and the wide - ranging " lost album " " @entity1 , " which was released in 1985			1
that was 15 years after the band broke up			2
the @entity12 would later reunite for a 1993 tour and , after guitarist @entity22 's passing , their 1996 introduction into the @entity60			2
@entity27 's songs were generally minimalist , sometimes self - consciously poetic , and usually delivered with a deadpan vocal that was all the more haunting , given the songs ' subject matter			1
" @entity49 will be the death of me , " he sang on " @entity49 , " and then added , " it 's my wife / and it 's my life , " followed by a chuckle so chilling it sounded like giving up			2
combined with the squeal of @entity21 's viola and the undertow of @entity75 's percussion , it was like peering down a dark alley			2
but @entity27 was nothing if not a student of pop as well			1
he 'd spent a couple @entity80 years slaving away at low - budget @entity81 learning the trade , and in his two - , three - and four - chord songs were undergirded with craftsmanship			0
four chords may have been a bit much , anyway : " one chord is fine			0
two chords is pushing it			0
three chords , and you 're into jazz , " he once said			0
" @entity98 , " from the " @entity4 " album , contrasted a gorgeous melody with warnings about the past			0
" @entity102 , " from " @entity4 , " had the purity of a prayer			0
and then there were " loaded 's " " @entity111 " and " @entity60 , " which -- in a more just universe -- would have been smash hits : the former a celebration of music , the latter a tribute to rock ' n ' radio			1
his post-velvets solo career was no less unpredictable			1
befriended by @entity113 -- who acknowledged the @entity1 's influence on his soundalike 1971 song " @entity116 " -- @entity27 created " @entity117 , " a @entity118 that featured his only top 40 hit , " @entity120			1
" one of the more unlikely hit singles of the pre-mtv era , the song featured unmistakable references to drag queens and oral sex , not to mention a jazzy saxophone solo from @entity113 himself ( who also produced the record )			2
but @entity27 would never be pigeonholed			1
three years later , he put out " @entity130 , " described by " the @entity131 of @entity60 " as " four sides of grating instrumental noise " and by rock critic ( and frequent @entity27 sparring partner ) @entity134 as " the greatest album ever made			1
" @entity134 was being sarcastic -- mostly -- but even his criticisms highlight the punk pleasure of ticking off authority figures : " all landlords ... deserve whatever they get , and ' @entity142 ' is the all - time guaranteed lease breaker			0
every tenant in @entity145 should own a copy of this album , " he wrote			0
outsiders often become insiders , and that was no less true for @entity27			1
by the ' 80s , indie bands were singling him out as a hero			0
his poker - faced demeanor became a tv mainstay on @entity157 scooter commercials			0
he even got airplay for his new music , such as " @entity161 , @entity162 , " from his 1984 album " @entity164			0
" he also showed a more open sense of humor , something that often ran underneath his compositions , even at their bleakest			1
the humor was most obvious in his occasional acting roles			2
he played a slick record producer in @entity175 's 1980 film " one @entity176 , " and a @entity179 parody named @entity180 in the underrated 1983 comedy " @entity177 , " turning idle dialogue ( " it 's a deathbed request " ) into instant songs			2
in recent decades , he had settled down with composer @entity185 and become more reflective			0
with @entity21 , he paid tribute to @entity1 patron @entity187 with " @entity188 " ( 1990 )			1
his 1992 album " @entity190 " looked at life and aging			0
it was all part of existence , just like heroin and pale blue eyes and new ages and street hassles			0
" i 'm a realist			0
that 's why i listen to @entity27 , " @entity134 wrote in 1980			1
but for all the darkness and light of his lyrics , the music was often the ticket to raw excitement			0
that 's why , even if all those people did n't form bands like the legend insists , the songs of @entity27 will always matter			1
he summed it up in four deceptively simple words from the exuberant " @entity60			0
" " it was all right , " he sang			0
" it was all right			0
" yes , it is .			0
