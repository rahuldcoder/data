lawmakers in the @entity54 , @entity2 's lower house of parliament , adopted the bill last week			1
the move by @entity2 politicians is widely seen as retaliation for a law that @entity9 president @entity61 signed on december 14			1
that bill , called the @entity63 , imposes @entity9 travel and financial restrictions on human rights abusers in @entity2			1
" the @entity9 is concerned by measures in the bill passed in the @entity54 today that , if it becomes law , would halt inter-country adoptions between the @entity9 and @entity2 and would restrict the ability of @entity2 civil society organizations to work with @entity9 partners , " @entity22 spokesman @entity67 said last week			1

@entity77 died in 2009 after a year in a @entity87 detention center , apparently beaten to death			0

" only @entity26 has more adoptions to the @entity9 than @entity2			2
backers of the @entity2 bill said @entity9 adoptive parents have been abusive , citing 19 deaths of @entity2 children since the 1990s			1
in 2010 , an @entity9 woman caused outrage after she sent her adopted son back to @entity2 alone on a one - way flight , saying the boy , then 7 , had violent episodes that made her family fear for its safety			2

" he also noted that the @entity9 is one of three nations that has not signed the 1989 @entity133			0
@entity134 , @entity135 executive director , touted the importance of " inter-country adoption			0
" " while welcoming prime minister @entity139 's call for the improvement of the child welfare system , @entity135 urges that the current plight of the many @entity2 children in institutions receives priority attention , " @entity134 said			2
@entity135 asked that @entity2 let children 's " best interests " guide the " design and development of all efforts to protect children			0
