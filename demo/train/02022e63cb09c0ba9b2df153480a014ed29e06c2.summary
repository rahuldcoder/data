-- a controversial car modification pioneered by @entity2 will be banned for the next @entity4 season after the rest of the teams voted against it			1
the f - duct aerodynamic system , which channels air flow to allow vehicles to go faster on the straights , has also been adapted by @entity13			1
however , concerns have arisen about how the feature is operated , with @entity13 's version requiring the driver to open and close a hole in the cockpit with his hands -- meaning less control over the steering wheel			1
@entity2 unsuccessfully tried to convince the other teams at a meeting before sunday 's @entity26 @entity25 , won by @entity28 's @entity27 , that the innovation should not be barred			1
the @entity30 told @entity0 that the decision was part of a package of measures that will be forwarded to motorsport 's governing body , the @entity35 , for ratification			2
a @entity30 spokesperson said details of the other recommendations would not be made available at this stage			2
@entity28 boss @entity42 outlined his opposition to the f - duct system			1
" it is a clever piece of engineering and hats off to the guys who invented it , but some of the solutions this weekend look a bit marginal when you see drivers driving with finger tips and no hands , " he said in quotes carried by @entity46			2
" so i think there is a safety issue and a cost issue to take into account			0
" at the weekend , @entity13 's @entity63 , who finished second in @entity64 , denied claims that he had to drive with his hand off the wheel , saying he has a pad sewn into his left glove to close the air hole			2
" in the simulator we practiced with this method so that now it is automatic			0
but in the future we will find a more comfortable solution for the drivers , " he told @entity76 's @entity75			0
however , @entity81 chief @entity80 also backed the banning of the system , according to @entity84			1
" i personally think that it is sensible to nip in the bud technologies that , on the face of it , do n't really have a relevance for use outside of @entity4 , " he said			0
" by the end of the year i know we , and i am sure most of the other teams , will have an f - duct on their car -- and that neutralizes the advantage of having it			1
" the engineers have already come up with ideas for next year that are zany in the extreme , and it is difficult to see how they would be used elsewhere			0
plus they would be expensive			0
" what we should be encouraging is stuff that we can be using elsewhere , and i am personally a big proponent of @entity106 because of that			0
" @entity106 were used to great effect by @entity2 and @entity13 last year , while @entity109 and @entity110 also used the technology			2
it was banned for this year , but some teams hope to have it reinstated for 2011			0
earlier this year , the @entity4 teams voted to ban the double - diffuser system from next season			1
@entity116 successfully used it at the start of 2009 to gain a big advantage which led to it winning the world constructors ' title and also the drivers ' crown for @entity125 .			0

@entity2 team pioneered f - duct system , which allows cars to go faster on the straights
@entity13 also adapted it , requiring drivers to open and close hole in cockpit with their hands
other teams voted against it before @entity26 @entity25 , citing safety and cost concerns
@entity81 chief says f - duct systems have little *applications* outside of @entity30
