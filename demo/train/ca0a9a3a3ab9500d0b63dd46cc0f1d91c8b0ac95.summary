@entity0 -- secretly accessing phone records of journalists			1
@entity4 targeting of conservative groups			0
misleading statements last year about the @entity8 terrorist attack			0
news headlines of the past week portray an administration engulfed in potential scandal , providing opponents of president @entity13 with plenty of ammunition to try to derail his agenda in the early months of his second term			1
the scenario invites comparisons to previous presidents who faced controversies in their " lame duck " second terms , such as the @entity11 of the @entity24 administration and @entity26 's impeachment for perjury and obstruction of justice in the @entity30			1
however , a rocky start to a second term does n't mean certain derailment of a president 's goals or agenda			2
for example , @entity24 and @entity26 both signed major fiscal legislation during their lame duck terms , noted @entity42 , the host of @entity1 's " @entity43			0
" despite increasingly strident rhetoric from @entity48 leaders and others , @entity45 spokesman @entity44 insisted tuesday the controversies have little connection to @entity13 's second - term agenda			1
" the president is focused on what he believes the @entity63 people expect from him and from their leaders in @entity0 , " he told reporters , citing campaign issues from his re-election last november such as economic growth , expanded opportunities for the middle class and immigration reform			2
in question is whether @entity48 intent on focusing attention on potential scandal will be willing to work with @entity13 and @entity69 on such major legislation			1
already , the president has seen stiff @entity48 opposition derail gun legislation he proposed in the aftermath of the @entity75 school massacre			1
full details of the controversies remain unknown , but the issues are certain to continue to dominate @entity0 in coming days			1
@entity44 spoke as attorney general @entity79 announced a @entity81 investigation of whether any laws were broken in the @entity4 political targeting			0
@entity84 also is looking into the matter , with a @entity45 committee hearing scheduled for friday			1
the embattled @entity79 , cited for contempt of @entity88 during @entity13 's first term over the botched " @entity91 " gun walking program , also confirmed that he recused himself last year from his department 's investigation of classified leaks that led to the recent secret subpoenas of telephone logs of @entity97			2
according to the @entity97 , @entity63 officials have said they were probing how details were leaked in may 2012 about a foiled bomb plot that targeted a @entity63 - bound aircraft , and that the @entity81 collected two months of telephone records for some @entity97 reporters and editors without notifying the news organization			2
the @entity106 called for @entity13 to demand @entity79 's resignation over the matter			0
if not , said @entity106 chairman @entity110 , it will show that " the president of the @entity63 believes his administration is above the @entity113 and does not respect the role of a free press			2
" even @entity69 such as senate majority leader @entity116 of @entity117 condemned the secret subpoena of @entity97 phone records			1
" i do n't know who did it , or why it was done , but it 's inexcusable , and there 's no way to justify this , " @entity116 told reporters			0
meanwhile , @entity48 senators characterized the @entity4 political targeting as a broad abuse of power by the administration			1
" i have never seen anything quite like this except in the past during the @entity137 years , " veteran sen. @entity132 , @entity133 , told reporters in an allusion to the @entity135 that led to president @entity137 's impeachment and resignation			0
@entity44 rejected such @entity48 statements as political hyperbole , but also sought to distance the administration from the roiling issues			1
" i understand the natural inclination to try to bunch some of these things together , but there really is a distinction here , " he said			0
he refused to discuss specific details of the @entity81 's subpoena of @entity97 telephone records , citing the ongoing criminal investigation of the classified leak			2
at the same time , he described @entity13 as desiring a balance between protecting classified information vital to national security and the @entity161 right of a free and unfettered press			0
@entity44 also avoided specific comment on @entity4 political targeting , saying it would be inappropriate until the upcoming release of an inspector general 's report on the matter			0
he noted @entity13 's remarks to reporters on monday that if the reported allegations of political targeting proved true , they would be " outrageous " and require immediate action against those responsible			0
however , @entity44 criticized the continuing @entity48 focus on the administration 's response in the immediate aftermath of the @entity8 attack last september 11 as a " sideshow that 's driven purely by or largely by political interests			1
" the @entity8 issue has renewed @entity48 criticism of former secretary of state @entity184 , considered the certain @entity69 frontrunner if she decides to run for president in 2016			2
in particular , @entity48 accuse the administration of not bolstering security prior to the attack , of botching the response to it , and of misleading the public in its slow - to - evolve explanation of events less than two months before the november election			1
after the @entity48 - led @entity198 held a hearing last week on the attack that killed the @entity63 ambassador to @entity201 and three other @entity63 , @entity48 politicians and organizations launched a campaign that sought to raise questions about @entity26 's role as the nation 's top diplomat at the time			2
an independent review of the @entity8 incident , led by @entity211 chairman adm. @entity210 and former ambassador @entity212 , found no wrongdoing by @entity26			0
@entity1 's chief national correspondent @entity214 noted that history shows popular politicians can overcome links to scandal			1
in 1988 , @entity69 tried to use the @entity11 of the @entity24 administration , which involved weapons sales to @entity221 that funded anti-communist rebels in @entity223 , against then - vice president @entity224 , he said			0
the scandal involved an attempted cover - up , televised congressional hearings , criminal charges and resignations , but in the end , @entity224 won the presidential vote			0
@entity1 's @entity232 contributed to this report .			0
