@entity2 buddies they are not			0
but there are all the makings of a spirited conversation for president @entity6 and incoming senate majority leader @entity7 , @entity8 , when this @entity10 odd couple meets at the @entity11 on wednesday afternoon			1
a new @entity13 proposal to fund the government thought what has been dubbed the " cromnibus , " which would pay for nearly all federal programs with an " omnibus " spending bill but only offer a short - term " continuing resolution " or " @entity24 " for immigration related spending is expected to be on the agenda			1
a presidential green - light to the " cromnibus , " a term that can only exist inside the @entity28 , could help ease tensions with @entity13 lawmakers who are still furious over @entity6 's executive action on immigration			2
@entity11 officials have so far not threatened to veto @entity35 's plan			1
the president 's request for $ 6 billion in emergency funding to battle @entity39 in @entity40 and a new authorization for the use of military force in the war against @entity45 are likely topics at the meeting as well			1
@entity48 laid out a nuts and bolts legislative wish - list for december 's lame duck session in @entity53 to reporters tuesday			0
" i think everyone agrees on a bipartisan basis those are the three things we must do here at the end of the session -- fund the government , make sure we do n't have any retroactive tax increases and follow the tradition of many years which is to pass a @entity65 , " @entity48 said			2
" i 'm confident the @entity67 will do that before we depart for the holidays , " he added			0
but in a sign of the frostiness of the @entity74 @entity13 's relationship with the president , @entity48 referred to @entity6 's immigration plan as " lawless " and a " poison pill			1
" @entity6 himself brought up the immigration action at a meeting with the @entity82 hours before he will sit down with @entity48			0
" i 'm still hopeful that we can get legislation done , " he said , saying that would " supplant " his executive actions			0
while @entity6 and @entity48 rarely ever sit down together privately , the two leaders have held such meetings a few more times than what has been previously acknowledged by aides to both men			0
same goes for the president and @entity11 speaker @entity35 , @entity95			1
the reason , top @entity11 officials have said , is that knowledge of their conversations could jeopardize relations between the @entity13 leaders and their more conservative members			1
yet it is also well - known the two men sometimes fail to connect			0
the president called but could not reach @entity48 on election night last month , just hours after he beat democrat @entity107 to win reelection in @entity74 and all but secure his place as the next @entity7			2
related : @entity6 reaches out , leaves message for @entity48 the scheduled 2:40 p.m. start time for wednesday 's meeting is a bit early to share that " @entity74 bourbon " with @entity48 , as @entity6 offered at his post midterms news conference last month			2
but given that @entity48 once vowed to make @entity6 a one - term president , perhaps the best both men can expect is a healthy pour of @entity10 reality .			0

the president and incoming senate leader @entity7 will meet wednesday
atop the agenda is the @entity13 ' @entity125 ' plan to keep the government running
the @entity11 has yet to threaten to veto the @entity13 plan
