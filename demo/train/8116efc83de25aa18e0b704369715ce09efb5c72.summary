@entity0 -- capital markets have funded wars for centuries			2
now the @entity5 is also turning to the stock market to help propel @entity8 's ambitious naval expansion plans			1
@entity10 's military spend , at $ 166bn last year , is second only to the @entity11			1
the country has been ramping up its naval prowess amid territorial disputes in the @entity15 and other surrounding waters			0
but with its largest defence contractors still predominantly state - owned , @entity8 wants to push them closer to the private sector and on to public markets to foster their growth			1
launching what it described as the start of a push to use capital markets to fund @entity8 's defence industry , state - controlled @entity23 , the country 's biggest shipbuilder , said it would raise @entity30 ( $ 1.4bn ) through a private placement of shares to buy production facilities and equipment to make warships			1
@entity8 investors cheered the prospect of being able to invest in the country 's military - industrial complex , driving the @entity0 - listed shares of @entity8 shipbuilding up by the daily limit of 10 per cent			1
shares of other companies expected to benefit , such as @entity44 , a maker of large steel structures , also surged			0
the company itself was quick to tout the lucrative nature of military assets to investors			0
" this will expand the range of investable assets in our capital market and will allow investors to enjoy the returns generated by high - end military products , " it said in a statement to the stock exchange			2
@entity8 has ramped up its military spending since the 1980s , with its official defence budget increasing at a double - digit pace in every year but one over the past two decades			1
its spending is still less than a quarter of the @entity11 which spent $ 682bn in 2012 , according to the @entity65			0
in recent years , @entity8 has placed extra emphasis on building up its blue - water navy -- a force capable of operating far from the country 's shores			1
mired in territorial disputes in the @entity72 with @entity73 and in the @entity15 with countries including the @entity75 and @entity76 , @entity8 has started to deploy naval ships more regularly to patrol what it defines as its sovereign waters			0
in 2011 , it launched its first aircraft carrier , the @entity81 , though it was built on an unfinished hull acquired from @entity83			1
analysts believe it is only a matter of time before @entity8 produces its first indigenous carrier			2
the @entity88 , a leading government - run financial newspaper , said the stock market penetration by companies in @entity8 's military industry was very low			1
while about 80 per cent of the assets of the world 's top 100 military companies are publicly listed , only 30 per cent of the assets of @entity8 's top 10 military companies have been listed , it said			2
for @entity8 's beleaguered shipbuilding industry , hit hard by overcapacity and slowing economic growth , the start of more military projects offers some consolation			2
" military spending is classic counter-cyclical support in a downturn , " said @entity104 , head of @entity106 transport research at @entity107			0
" it 's simply a more stable part of the business and one they want to talk about more because the commercial side is in free fall			0
" @entity23 's private placement structure is complex			0
it is issuing shares to two sibling companies , @entity120 and @entity121 , to raise the funds , and is then using that money to acquire some of those two company 's military assets			0
initially , these assets had been stripped out of the listed company when @entity23 went public			0
