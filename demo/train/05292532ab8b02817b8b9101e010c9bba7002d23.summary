-- the tornado that tore through the @entity3 suburbs this week ranks among the strongest storms ever to strike the @entity5 , packing powerful winds that topped 200 mph			1
officials from the @entity8 gave the tornado that hit @entity10 on monday a preliminary @entity12 rating -- the highest score on the scale that measures tornado intensities			1
the @entity12 scale uses the physical damage caused by the storm to estimate how fast the wind was blowing			1
opinion : how can we be safe from tornadoes ? teams are still evaluating the destruction , and the rating released tuesday is preliminary			1
so far , they 've found that the tornado spanned 1.3 miles -- the length of more than 22 football fields lined up end - to - end -- carving a 17 - mile path of destruction			1
damage assessments show that the tornado was an @entity12 for at least some of the time it was ravaging the area near @entity3			1
@entity3 mayor @entity37 did n't mince words tuesday when he described what he saw			0
" we 're talking levels of debris that 's 4 feet high , as far as you can see			0
and we 're talking about cars that are upside - down and school books and children 's toys and trees without bark , " he said			2
" this was the storm of storms			0
" tornado prediction is improving , scientists say as officials continue to assess the damage , here are @entity0 senior meteorologist @entity56 's responses to some key questions about the storm : what are @entity12 storms ? storms now used the @entity12 scale , or ef scale , which is based on damage , which than translates to estimated winds			1
@entity12 storms are the strongest storms on @entity68 , with winds of over 200 mph			1
how frequent are @entity12 storms ? you can go years without an @entity12 tornado			2
in fact , since 1950 this is only the 59th tornado on record that has reached that threshold			0
how frequent are storms of this strength in this area ? while @entity12 storms are rare , the area in the @entity81 known as " @entity82 " is a focus for when this happens			0
there also seems to be a focus for strong tornadoes in an area known as " @entity89 , " which covers parts of the @entity91 and includes @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95			0
opinion : the making of a nightmare tornado what factors give rise to a storm of this strength ? a number of factors have to come together at the right time and place to produce a strong tornado			2
the clash of warm and cold air at the surface combined with lift in the atmosphere and strong winds both at the ground and high above help contribute			0
the greater the temperature differences and the winds , the greater the chance for supercells , or the thunderstorms that produce tornadoes			0
deadliest tornadoes on record how long does it take to assess the strength of a storm ? why does it take so long ? after a tornado , the local @entity8 office sends a team to take a look at the damage			2
in this case , the @entity132 , @entity133 , office sent numerous teams in the field to evaluate damage			0
since this storm path was 17 miles long and the damage path was so wide , it takes time to see all of the damage			1
some people are calling this the strongest storm ever			0
is that accurate ? crews are still surveying the damage			0
the strongest tornado on record to date struck @entity10 in 1999			0
it had winds recorded at 318 mph at 300 feet above the earth 's surface			2
at the surface , officials estimated winds were at 250 mph			2
the estimated winds of this week 's storm are 200 - 210 mph , but survey teams are still evaluating			1
it 's safe to say this is one of the strongest tornadoes			1
@entity10 in bull 's - eye twice , science may know why @entity0 's @entity165 contributed to this report .			1

officials give the @entity133 tornado a preliminary @entity12 rating
storm 's winds topped 200 mph as it carved a 17 - mile path of destruction
@entity177 spanned 1.3 miles
@entity0 senior meteorologist : " it 's safe to say this is one of the strongest tornadoes "
