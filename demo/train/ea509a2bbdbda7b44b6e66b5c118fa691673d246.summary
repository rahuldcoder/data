-- when an earthquake threatens to turn part of an ocean into fast - moving walls of water , tsunami warning scientists can do nothing for the first five minutes except wait for information			1
but within the next five minutes , they have to decide whether to issue a warning of danger			1
@entity11 has been a geophysicist at the @entity12 for four years			0
and you thought your job was high pressure			0
" if we see a set of circumstances and it fits into our criteria for [ the ] event , we just follow that criteria because we do n't have much time to think			2
there is n't a lot of time for decision - making , " said @entity23 , director of the @entity24 and @entity25			2
" weighing back there [ in your mind ] also is the effect of your decision			0
if the effect of your decision is going to evacuate the entire @entity24 waterfront , you do n't want to take that lightly , " he said			0
with tuesday 's tragic tsunami that engulfed villages in @entity41 and @entity42 , the pace of events was so frenetic that the @entity12 in @entity43 , @entity44 -- which tracks earthquakes and tsunamis for countries throughout the @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 -- had already been alerted to the looming disaster by the time the seismometer evidence came in			1
" the @entity55 director in @entity42 called the @entity12 a few seconds before the alarms went off here , so we had an advanced warning and we were already sitting at the computer , looking at the data in real time , " said @entity11 , a @entity48 warning center geophysicist			1
it can take 30 seconds to five minutes for information from earthquake sensors placed strategically around the globe to roll into the two @entity68 tsunami warning centers			1
when there 's a clear tsunami threat , the center 's operation room -- built to accommodate the two workers on duty -- becomes flooded with people all jostling to offer assistance			1
the phone lines consistently ring and " people are yelling at each other so everyone will be on the same page , and you do n't miss something important that someone else caught , " said @entity84 , a @entity24 and @entity86 warning center scientist			1
scientists must " locate the earthquake and then determine based on the science data whether there should be just a normal bulletin or whether there should be a warning , " said @entity87 , director of the @entity88			1
she added that it took the @entity48 warning center 15 minutes to issue a warning for tuesday 's tsunami			1
this was n't because the center 's scientists were moving slowly , @entity11 said , but a result of the sparse number of seismic stations in the @entity106			2
the fewer stations there are , the longer it takes for scientists to receive adequate information			0
" there was no delay yesterday , " he said			0
" you 're only restricted by the earth itself and how fast the seismic waves can travel			0
" as a result , workers at the two @entity68 warning centers said they often have to make decisions based on incomplete information , erring on the side of caution by issuing a tsunami warning and canceling it later if more monitoring reveals a less dangerous situation			1
" it can be a lot of pressure at first , and you have to get used to that , " @entity11 said			0
" you do have a lot of responsibility on your shoulders : you have to act quickly and sometimes you have to issue your very first initial message based on incomplete information , because one of the important factors is time and you want to get it out			2
" since the catastrophic @entity49 tsunami in 2004 , the question of time has become more critical to tsunami warning scientists			1
the staff has doubled at the @entity48 warning center , and when they 're " on shift , " they sleep in on - site housing , said spokeswoman @entity152			1
the warning centers have turned into 24/7 operations			1
scientist @entity84 and director @entity23 at the @entity24 and @entity86 center said constantly being on call does not interrupt their personal lives ; neither of them have kids at home			1
@entity11 , on the other hand , has a 2 - year - old son and has to strike a balance			0
at first , his wife and son stayed with him when he was on shift , sleeping at the on - site housing with him			2
when that proved too disruptive , his family instead began visiting for meals and a bit of quality time during his weekly two - day shift			2
the @entity48 center 's on - site housing is unique , created so the workers can react to a tsunami whether they 're fixing a meal or fast asleep , and while it may pose a slight inconvenience , it 's all part of the job , @entity11 said			1
the workers , drawn to the position by a mutual love of geophysical science , consider themselves lucky to work in one of the few science fields that allows them to do research while making a difference in people 's lives			2
instances such as tuesday 's tsunami , which killed at least 130 people , provide them with perspective on the importance of their position and the need for more tsunami education			2
@entity11 is encouraging the @entity48 center to use social networking as a tool , considering the massive response he got after he tweeted live updates tuesday			1
for @entity84 , it 's getting the word out about what to look for when disaster is imminent			0
" one of the reasons we have an outreach program is because we know that people ca n't wait for us to make a decision , " @entity84 said			0
" if the ground is shaking for more than 20 seconds , you 're experiencing a large earthquake and the more likely it is that a tsunami is going to happen			0
" @entity88 director @entity225 , whose work emphasizes the need for better , more local warning systems and education around the globe , agreed			2
" it 's especially tragic when you know that a number of us were in @entity42 and @entity237 in july talking about tsunamis , telling them that in the worst case scenario they would only have 10 to 20 minutes and asking them to plan the best they could , " she said			0
" we kind of have a feeling when we 're issuing those messages that something like this might happen , and it 's your worst nightmare when it does come true			0
it 's not a good feeling the next day when the numbers start to increase , " she said			0
" we ca n't prevent the tsunami from happening ; it 's going to happen			0
we can only do our best right now and plan beforehand , because when it does happen , there 's just no time			0

time is always crucial when you work as a tsunami warning scientist
a warning can be issued anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes after a threat is identified
at the @entity48 warning center , workers live on site for two days to monitor data
after the 2004 @entity49 tsunami , warning centers operate around the clock
