@entity0 broke some ground with her straight - to - @entity3 surprise album , and now she is also reaping the benefits of her strategy			1
according to @entity7 , the self - titled album " is all but guaranteed a no. 1 debut			0
" on monday , @entity3 announced the album has become the fast - selling worldwide on its site " with an unprecedented 828,773 albums sold in just its first three days			1
" " @entity0 , " which is the superstar 's fifth studio album , also broke @entity3 ' first - week sales record in the @entity14 , with more than 600,000 copies sold			1
@entity7 's @entity18 notes such sales are a huge achievement given that the album has only been available for a few days			0
" all of ( @entity0 's ) previous albums were released on a tuesday , the traditional day when albums are released each week , " he writes			2
" thus , a tuesday release would receive six days of sales in their debut week			0
but , since ' @entity0 ' dropped at midnight on a friday , its sales are more staggering , since they are just from a little more than three days			2
" the release may be the singer 's biggest debut to date			0
her most successful first week performance so far was her second album , " @entity35 , " which debuted at no. 1 with 541,000 sold in 2006 , according to @entity34			0
" @entity39 " has been a much used term with both @entity0 's " visual album " and the way in which it was released			1
with 14 songs and 17 music videos , " @entity0 " was released on @entity3 with no fanfare or marketing push -- just a social media announcement that it had arrived			1
the way @entity0 was able to leverage social media while also keeping the digital project a secret means that the singer 's latest is garnering even more buzz than it would have if it were a traditional label release			2
" firstly , the fact that she recorded and then released it completely unbeknownst to everyone means that the reception it 'll receive is going to be even more jubilant , more outrageous than it would 've been , which is actually hard to imagine given the veracity and enthusiasm of @entity0 fans to begin with , " writes @entity50 of the site @entity52			2
" however , because there 's been no lead up marketing plan , you can bet your sweet @entity0 that everyone and their mother will be buying the album as soon as possible to see what the hype is about			1
" @entity72 from @entity73 wrote , " the mechanics and philosophy behind the star 's album release are n't groundbreaking " given that acts such as @entity79 have released albums with only a few days ' notice while @entity82 quietly released his first album in a decade via his website			0
the difference in this case , however , is that @entity0 is a megastar who could easily have the full machine of a record label backing her if she so chose			1
" for a long time , the music industry was breaking down at the edges -- an indie band 's album leak here , a free hip - hop mixtape there , not to mention the small but consistent drop in sales every quarter , " @entity72 writes			0
" but when an artist as big as @entity0 begins to go her own way , you know the tower has crumbled			0
