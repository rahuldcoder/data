-- when @entity2 's 27 - year - old ceo , @entity1 , wore a hoodie at a presentation to investors during the lead - up to @entity2 's initial public offering , a financial analyst publicly accused @entity1 of immaturity			1
by dressing casually at such an important event , he alleged , @entity1 was telling potential shareholders they did n't matter			1
the blogosphere 's response was swift : business and tech commentators across the nation rushed to the billionaire 's defense , explaining that the hooded sweatshirt was a symbol of his independent - mindedness , his youth , his authenticity , his loyalty to the culture of @entity26			1
they argued his business acumen is reflected in @entity2 's numbers , not in his fashion choices			1
now that the firestorm has cooled , it 's worth taking a moment to consider the complex significance of the hoodie for someone like @entity1			1
life on @entity2 in one respect , both the anti-hoodie and pro-hoodie factions are correct			2
when @entity1 wears a hoodie at a high - profile meeting , he 's saying : i am an artist , not a salesman			1
salesmen wear suits because their job is to persuade , seduce , cajole ; appearance is all - important			0
and the salesman 's first priority is profit , which , if you 're a @entity2 shareholder , is the ethos you might wish to see in the ceo of the company you 're investing in			1
but @entity1 has said explicitly he is devoted above all to his beautiful creation : @entity2			1
this , presumably , is why he turned down @entity57 's offer of $ 1 billion for the company back in its early years and chose to keep running the company himself			0
he 's first and foremost an inventor , a tinkerer in a workshop , a monk in hooded robes			0
sales , the bottom line , these are not the things that define me , the hoodie says			2
to a tech geek , indifference to dress is a badge of pride because any creative endeavor , whether it 's coding software or writing novels , goes better if you can forget about yourself entirely , forget about how you look , what you 're wearing , how people perceive you			1
your must immerse yourself in your art. it must become the only thing on your mind			0
timeline : @entity1 's rise from child prodigy to @entity2 billionaire the nerd 's spastic movements , childlike laugh , checked - out eyes as she codes or writes or thinks are the symptoms of a person obsessed with work , a person unconscious of herself and the impression she 's making			1
that 's why @entity99 used to dress like a homeless guy , and @entity101 wore a black turtleneck , why @entity1 wears the hoodie			1
it 's about taking pride in being an artist			1
@entity108 's evolution from fashion mainstay to symbol of injustice so the analyst who said the hoodie shows i - do n't - give - a - damn attitude was right in one sense , but he was wrong to suggest @entity1 's hoodie was bad news for @entity2 investors			1
because showing the world that you 're an artist instead of a salesman can be a great sales tactic			1
as a cub reporter , i had the privilege of watching @entity101 pitch the @entity127 movie " @entity128 " to a handful of journalists in a small room			0
it was the best sales presentation i 've ever seen			0
while it was happening , i wanted to do anything @entity101 asked , because he was able to seem like he did n't care what we thought of him			0
he was unshaven , wearing his cat - burglar ensemble			0
he never tried to kiss up to any of us , like movie people often did			0
there were no visual aids , no refreshments			0
he just fulminated about what a good movie it was , how major its advances in animation technology , almost as if we were n't there			0
are you living without @entity2 ? he was a brilliant salesman because he did n't act much like a salesman			1
you believed him because he did n't seem like he cared that much whether you believed him or not			0
he was a good - looking , confident person , but his conduct in many respects was that of somebody so passionate about his work that it made him just a little socially unacceptable			0
this guy is a nerd , you thought -- the real thing , so he must know what he 's talking about			0
@entity1 has learned much , i suspect , from @entity101			2
he knows the impression he makes is important , so , like @entity101 , he acts like he does n't think it 's important			2
the hoodie is both who he really is -- a big nerd -- and a thoughtful executive 's performance of who he really is			2
he is n't being immature or youthful at all			2
he 's striving to earn the confidence of investors by presenting himself as a scruffy genius who does n't care about earning their confidence			2
and that 's good business			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity180 .			0

@entity2 ceo @entity1 was *criticized* for wearing a hoodie in meeting
@entity180 : @entity1 's hoodie signals that he is an artist , not a salesman
he says that for tech geeks , indifference to dress is a badge of pride
@entity180 : @entity1 is n't immature ; wearing a hoodie is a great sales tactic
