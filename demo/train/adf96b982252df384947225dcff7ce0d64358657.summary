@entity0 -- @entity2 had it all -- a sterling global reputation , bipartisan respect , a fat campaign bank account and 36 years of @entity8 experience			1
but somewhere along the line he forgot @entity11 's old axiom : all politics is local			2
on tuesday , that mistake cost @entity2 his career			2
the 80 - year - old pillar of @entity0 's foreign policy establishment lost his @entity18 primary battle to a younger , hungrier and more politically attuned conservative challenger , state treasurer @entity19			1
@entity2 loses @entity21 primary the venerable senator 's finished			1
chalk up another win for the tea party			0
@entity2 " served too long , " said @entity21 pollster @entity25 , who did public opinion research for the race			2
" we 're in a new era			0
" the list of conservative complaints against @entity2 has grown over the last several years , a period coinciding with an aggressive campaign to rid the @entity18 of officeholders who fail to march in lockstep with the party 's ideological activists			1
@entity2 voted for @entity39 nominees @entity37 and @entity40 , advocated a hike in the gas tax , backed immigration reform , opposed an earmark spending ban and supported the financial and auto industry bailouts			2
he was the @entity8 @entity18 's most prominent supporter of a new arms control treaty with @entity48 , @entity50 's " number one geopolitical foe , " according to @entity51			1
@entity2 was once called @entity55 's favorite @entity21 senator , a fact @entity19 's campaign repeated endlessly			1
with friends like that , conservatives asked , who needs enemies ? " it all adds up , " said @entity18 pollster @entity61 , who helped @entity2 in the past but is working for @entity19 this time			1
it " goes against ( @entity64 primary voters ' ) conservative values			2
" @entity2 's " campaign was not very nimble or adept at responding to some of the charges against him , " one @entity64 @entity21 operative said			1
" you have to react and you have to pivot " when challenged			0
there was " a failure to remind people what @entity2 has done for this state , this country , and this world			2
" to the end , @entity2 kept the support of establishment @entity21 leaders like @entity64 gov. @entity81 and @entity83 sen. @entity82			1
but insurgent icons like former @entity86 gov. @entity85 , @entity88 rep. @entity87 and former @entity90 sen. @entity89 flocked to @entity19 's banner			2
perhaps more importantly , outside conservative groups like @entity93 and @entity94 poured pro-mourdock ad money into the state , obliterating what once would have been considered an insurmountable financial advantage for @entity2			0
none of that may have happened , however , if @entity2 had paid more attention to @entity64 @entity21 in recent years			1
most analysts contacted by @entity1 reached the same conclusion : @entity2 's defeat is as much a reflection of the political weakness of a globetrotting elder statesman who failed to maintain ties with the folks back home as it is a sign of tea party strength			1
@entity19 is " the uber - accessible guy , " the operative noted			0
" any ( state party ) event you go to , there should be a @entity19 name tag printed out because chances are he 's showing up			2
... he 's at every chili cook - off imaginable			0
" the operative noted that @entity2 rarely if ever showed up to local @entity21 events in recent years			2
not coincidentally , the overwhelming majority of local @entity18 officials backed @entity19			1
there was a feeling among the @entity18 's county chairmen that @entity2 is " too big for us , and he 's too good for us , " @entity125 said			1
in contrast , the operative said , @entity64 's other @entity18 senator , @entity129 , assiduously courted grassroots activists and local party leaders when he decided to return to elected office in @entity64 after more than a decade working as a diplomat and a @entity0 lobbyist			1
while @entity129 was n't a tea party favorite when he won the @entity18 nod in 2010 , his hard work on the local level helped him beat back a primary challenge from a couple of candidates more strongly favored by conservatives			2
a number of analysts said @entity2 should have followed the lead of @entity8 colleague @entity149 , who committed significant time and resources to his own renomination fight this year			0
two years ago , @entity149 saw fellow @entity154 sen. @entity153 lose his @entity18 nomination battle to political newcomer @entity156			0
@entity153 , a fairly conservative three - term @entity8 veteran , failed to see the @entity140 storm coming in 2010 and paid the price at that year 's @entity160 convention			0
after @entity153 's loss , @entity149 furiously cultivated the support of local activists			0
in april , he won the support of an overwhelming majority of delegates at the state convention			0
he is now expected to easily win his primary and roll to victory in the general election			0
for many @entity173 , a controversy earlier this year over @entity2 's residence crystallized the perception that he had abandoned them			1
@entity2 , who actually has lived in northern @entity176 since the sale of his @entity179 home in 1977 , was forced to beat back a ballot eligibility challenge based on the location of his current home			2
@entity2 successfully argued that @entity64 's constitution only required him to maintain a physical residence in the state during his first campaign			1
politically , however , the damage was done			0
at one point , @entity2 admitted he was n't even sure what address was on his @entity64 driver 's license			1
@entity64 politics , the operative noted , has a long history of residency - based ballot access controversies			0
@entity129 faced a similar challenge when he returned to the state to run for @entity8 in 2010			0
" in and of itself , i do n't think it would have worked , " the operative said			0
but @entity2 is " casting these ( controversial ) votes because he 's never here and does n't hear us			1
" the residency issue was more potent this time around " because it fits the overall narrative			0
" the challenge to @entity2 's residency , @entity61 told @entity1 , " was saying he 's really gone to @entity0 and does n't even live here anymore			1
" why , he wondered , did n't @entity2 " just buy a condo ? " two - thirds of primary voters in @entity19 's campaign polls said @entity2 has been in @entity0 too long and is out of touch with @entity215 values , @entity61 added			1
@entity19 , in contrast , has pledged to serve only two terms in @entity0			0
@entity19 also maintained a " respectful " tone while challenging the veteran senator , @entity61 added			0
@entity19 " stood up in ( his ) one debate ( with @entity2 ) and was credible , " @entity125 said			1
he may have been the favorite of the most conservative voters , but " nobody could say he 's a whack job			0
" now @entity19 is probably going to @entity0			0
and @entity2 , a hero of the @entity0 establishment , is headed home , wherever that is .			0

@entity2 lost primarily because he did n't *pay* attention to his @entity18 base
@entity2 took a series of positions out of line with current @entity18 *orthodoxy*
@entity2 's failure to keep an @entity64 residence showed him as out of touch
@entity19 paid close attention to @entity64 's @entity18 grassroots
