-- " how do we explain this to children ? " the question echoed across the country saturday night after a @entity7 jury cleared @entity8 in the shooting death of @entity10			1
trial watchers outside the @entity13 courthouse cried and hugged after the verdict , which followed 16½ hours of deliberations			2
but the decision sparked shock and outrage well beyond @entity13 in a case that has been racially charged from the start			2
@entity8 's supporters applauded the jury for siding with the neighborhood watch volunteer 's claims that he shot the teen in self - defense			1
others said prosecutors failed to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt			2
but their voices were drowned out by those who viewed the trial as a referendum on race that confirmed what some said they knew all along : " ca n't be surprised ... black life has no value in this country , " rapper @entity37 said in a tweet that was shared more than 2,000 times			1
' @entity13 has changed for the better ' demonstrators gathered saturday in @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and other major @entity48 cities for mostly peaceful protests , while civil rights groups and leaders , from rev. @entity52 to rep. @entity53 , expressed disappointment with the verdict saturday			1
images of people in hooded sweatshirts flooded @entity59 and @entity60 tagged with combinations of # hoodsup # @entity62 and # @entity63			2
the 17 - year - old was wearing a hooded sweatshirt when he left the home of his father 's fiancee on february 26 , 2012 , to buy skittles and a drink from a convenience store			1
he was on his way back when @entity8 spotted him walking through his gated community and called 911 to report a " suspicious " person in a " dark hoodie			1
" he was not charged until a groundswell of protest forced officials to reexamine the case			0
people took to the streets in " hoodie marches " and more than two million people signed a @entity85 petition asking @entity7 prosecutors to bring charges against @entity8			1
a lawyer for @entity10 's family said saturday the petition showed support for the idea that " a black 17 - year - old child should be able to walk home from the store and not be shot			1
" i think they may have saved the life of another child -- because i think that from now on , if there is someone who wants to follow someone with a gun , i think they 'll think twice about it			1
and so for those people , i say thank you , " @entity104 said saturday night			0
" @entity13 has changed for the better			0
and i think there is grace and dignity in what these people did in the peaceful protests			0
" a legacy of racial profiling others , however , saw less cause for hope in the case 's outcome , calling @entity10 the latest victim of racial profiling in a legacy that includes @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125			1
for many , the verdict confirmed that " walking while black is a crime punishable by death , " as @entity59 user @entity130 said in a tweet that was shared more than 300 times			1
" there will be a great deal said about what the verdict in this trial means , but most fundamentally we should understand that it means validation for the idea that the actions @entity8 took that night were rational , the conclusions he drew sound , and that a black teen - ager can be considered armed any time he is walking down a paved street , " author and educator @entity133 said in a @entity136 column shortly after the verdict			1
" the decision the six jurors reached on saturday evening will inspire anger , frustration , and despair , but little surprise , and this is the most deeply saddening aspect of the entire affair			0
from the outset — throughout the forty - four days it took for there to be an arrest , and , then , in the sixteen months it took for the case to come to trial — there was a nagging suspicion that it would culminate in disappointment			1
" @entity133 was one of many who learned of the verdict after leaving a screening of " @entity172 , " a film about the police - shooting death of @entity125 four years ago in @entity176 , @entity177			1
@entity178 ' @entity172 ' tonight			0
how ironic to come home to this verdict , " author @entity179 said on @entity59			0
of the verdict , @entity182 , the actor who plays @entity125 , said " i can not believe this is the @entity48 i live in right now			0
" social media erupted in response to the verdict , although chatter began earlier in the day during deliberations			0
" the fundamental danger of an acquittal is not more riots , it is more @entity200 , " @entity44 radio host @entity190 , founder of @entity193 's @entity192 , said in a tweet that has been shared more than 8,000 times			1
" like , i think , a lot of us , i pretty much expected this			0
does n't make it any easier to take , " he said after the verdict , echoing the sentiments of many			0
mothers and fathers of various races wondered what this meant for their children			0
" here 's hoping that all those kids out there in @entity48 buying @entity217 with their # hoodsup stay safe tonight , " @entity213 said			2
when stand your ground does n't work critics brought up the story of a @entity7 woman who was sentenced to 20 years in 2012 for firing a warning shot to scare off her abusive husband			0
@entity226 unsuccessfully tried to use @entity7 's controversial " stand your ground " law to derail the prosecution			2
debate has swirled over the law , which allows those who believe they are in imminent danger to use deadly force to protect themselves			0
but a jury convicted @entity238 of aggravated assault after just 12 minutes of deliberation			2
the case , which was prosecuted by the same state attorney who handled the @entity10 case , gained the attention of civil rights leaders , who said the @entity247 - @entity48 woman was persecuted because of her race			1
but amid the sorrow , messages of peace and hope emerged			0
" @entity253 does n't roll in on wheels of inevitability but comes through continuous struggle			0
so we must straighten ( our ) ... backs & work 4 freedom , " @entity262 , mayor of @entity264 said , quoting dr. @entity257 " bigotry & hate wo n't just quietly disappear - nor be defeated by more hate			2
it 'll take stubborn , relentless , unyielding love & service			0
" @entity3 's @entity271 contributed to this report .			2
