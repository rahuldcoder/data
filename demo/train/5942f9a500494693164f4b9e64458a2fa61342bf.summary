-- " everyone agrees we need to go forward with the relief well , " national incident commander @entity0 said friday of the now - plugged @entity3 gusher in the @entity4 , adding that officials are now considering other options in addition to the relief well			1
work will resume on a relief well as scientists and @entity3 engineers continue to assess whether a planned " bottom kill " is necessary , he said			1
the @entity3 oil well , which ruptured april 20 after an explosion on the @entity19 oil rig , spilled more than 2 million gallons of oil per day into the @entity4 before being successfully shut			2
@entity0 said that pressure tests were finished and that pressure within the wellhead was unchanged			1
that means there are options about how to handle the well , which has stopped pouring oil into the @entity4 , he said			1
" we have successfully shut in this well			0
we have something now that we have n't had before and we have we have -- i would n't call it a luxury -- but we have the trade space to consider alternatives under less than a high - pressure situation			1
" @entity0 said crews probably did " too good a job on the top kill			1
" cement and mud got into a core area of the well			1
but @entity0 said it 's not clear how thick the cement layer is , or how vulnerable it might be to pressure inside the well			1
" everyone agrees we need to go forward with the relief well , " @entity0 said			1
" the relief well will be finished			1
how it gets finished will be determined on risk mitigation and the way forward is the essence of what is being discussed right now			0
the relief well will be finished			2
we will kill the well			0
" as they await answers about the condition of the well , businesses in the @entity60 are hoping high - profile visitors will help boost local economies			2
president @entity66 and his wife , @entity67 , plan to travel to the region this weekend to support businesses that have been devastated by the oil disaster			1
one of their daughters , @entity73 , will join them for the trip			0
their other daughter , @entity76 , is at a camp and will not make the trip , a senior administration official said			0
the family will leave saturday morning for @entity81 , @entity82			1
" even as the president talks about what our next steps are in our response , obviously part of this will be highlighting the tremendous economic toll that has taken place , " @entity84 spokesman @entity83 told reporters earlier this week			0
visitors spent more than $ 34 billion in 2008 in congressional districts along the @entity60 , sustaining 400,000 jobs			0
the effects of the oil spill on the region 's travel industry could last up to three years and cost up to $ 22.7 billion , according to an analysis conducted last month by @entity103 for the @entity104			1
in preparing the research , @entity103 looked at current spending , government models predicting oil flow and the effect of 25 past crises on tourism to develop a model to gauge the @entity4 disaster 's impact			0
case studies of past disasters -- including the @entity118 respiratory disease outbreak , @entity119 and the 2004 @entity121 tsunami -- show that tourism often is affected beyond the disaster area and long after the resolution of the crisis			2
to mitigate the effects of the disaster , changing perceptions is key			2
" the president will meet with those folks and have a chance to update , i think , the region on where we are , " @entity83 said			0
" and i think it will be important for the president to talk about what are the next steps in bringing the region back			0
" meanwhile , work is expected to resume friday on the drilling of a relief well that is intended to give engineers a better look at the core of the well			1
pressure tests will help them make a recommendation to former adm. @entity0 , the federal government point man on the disaster , on whether a bottom kill is necessary to permanently seal the ruptured deepwater oil well			2
the well erupted after an april 20 explosion aboard the drilling rig @entity19 that left 11 dead			0
a temporary cap contained the spill on july 15 , and nearly 3,000 barrels of heavy drilling mud and cement drove the oil back under the ocean floor last week in the static kill process			2
the well gushed an estimated 53,000 barrels ( nearly 2.3 million gallons ) of oil per day before it was capped			0
since then , fresh , green grass has started growing again in some of the hardest - hit marshes of southern @entity165 , but oil continues to wash ashore in some places			0
@entity1 's @entity168 contributed to this report .			0

new : work on relief well will resume
new : unchanged pressure in wellhead gives crews more options on killing well
the first family will travel to @entity81 , @entity82 , saturday
financial effects of the spill could hurt area businesses for up to three years
