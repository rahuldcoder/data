@entity0 of @entity1 , @entity2 , an @entity4 mom of two , says she and her husband are still trying to figure out how to sit their 8 - year - old son down and explain the @entity9 case and its conclusion -- without getting emotional			1
" my biggest issue is ... giving him the facts rather than getting upset and giving him how i feel , because i want him to come to his own consensus , " the host of the blog four hats and @entity12 said in an interview			0
" my husband is the same way			0
he 's very emotional about it ... so he does n't want him to think , ' well , @entity24 feels this way so i should			1
' he wants him to create his own opinion			0
" when @entity9 , who is not related to @entity9 's family , ultimately has the conversation with her little guy , who always " likes to know the why , " he 'll no doubt ask about race , she said			1
" we 're going to have to tell him that it may have been due to @entity9 's race , and this is how it happened , and this is how @entity39 decided to react to it , " she said			1
" it 's going to be very hard to sit him down and have the conversation , but we know we have to do it			1
" while not everyone agrees that @entity9 was racially profiled , the case and the protests that followed have led to larger conversations between parents and kids			1
some are focusing on race -- @entity9 was black and @entity39 identifies as @entity52 , so it 's not just a black and white issue			1
still , others are n't even talking about race but are focusing on behavior			1
but when i set out to interview moms about the verdict , and ask what they are telling their kids , i got two very different responses			1
@entity4 - @entity4 moms like @entity0 were extremely willing and interested to talk about their experiences , while very few moms who were not @entity4 came forward			1
then i saw a post by @entity68 , a white mom of two and author of the blog @entity70 , which explained a lot -- that white moms are n't talking about the story , at least not publicly , and they should be			2
" i think that @entity77 - @entity76 are talking about it privately , but they are nervous to talk about it publicly , and i think this is an ongoing issue in the @entity76 , that race is still a topic that people are afraid to discuss unless you 're a person of color and you 're living it every day , " @entity68 told me			1
" it 's easy for my friends of color who are mothers to say , ' that could have been my kid and it feels personal , ' and it 's easier for them to speak out and take action the way i think so many white people did with @entity95 , for example -- ' that could have been my kid , ' " she added			2
" what 's important is for us to remember is that it could have been any of our kids , skin color aside , and so there are so many layered issues that we have to have these conversations			1
" @entity68 says she has n't talked with her girls , ages 6 and 8 , about the @entity9 case , but if her 8 - year - old hears about it , she 'll discuss it with her			1
" i 'd rather talk about the macro issue with her , about treating people with respect and not judging people based on how they look , than get into the details of a murder case			2
she is still very young			0
" one mom 's message to her kids while some parents may approach the topic from the viewpoint that @entity9 was more likely to be treated differently because he was @entity4 , other parents are using the case as a behavioral lesson and leaving race aside			1
@entity130 , a mom of two in @entity132 , @entity133 , watched a lot of the trial with her 15 - year - old daughter and 10 - year - old son , and discussed the verdict when it was handed down			1
" i told my kids both people used really poor judgment , " she said during an interview			2
" they had assumptions about the other , even without knowing the situation			0
neither one of them should have engaged			0
" " i told my kids , if they are ever in a situation where they do n't know if someone 's following them or what 's going on , they just need to get home			1
do n't linger around , " she said			0
as they watched the trial , she said her kids were constantly trying to figure out who was right and who was wrong			1
" my kids would go back and forth			2
one would say , ' well , @entity9 , it was his fault because he started the fight			0
' the other one would have said , ' well , @entity39 , he should have never gotten out of the car			1
' i think it was never clear - cut			2
" " a lot of times children 's brains will try to process information in a very black and white way , but in this case , they could n't do that , " she said			1
comforting a brother who does n't understand @entity172 , editor for @entity174 audiences at @entity175 , went to pick up her 14 - year - old brother for a movie outing sunday , a day after the verdict was announced			2
her brother carried a hoodie over his arm			0
his father told him not to put it on until they got inside the movie theater			0
her brother did n't understand , and told @entity172 their dad said it 's because of " that kid that died			2
" " he did n't have a gun on him , right ? so why would that other guy shoot him ? " her little brother asked			0
when she told him about the " stand your ground " law in @entity198 , her brother responded that @entity9 was " so small			0
" " every question that seems so obvious to everyone that 's so shocked by the verdict , i see it in my little brother 's eyes , " she told me			2
" he said , ' i just do n't get it			0
... why would they have that law ? ' " @entity172 said she has steered away from talking about race with her brother , saying she was always raised to believe she is the same as everyone else			2
but after the @entity9 case , she felt she needed to talk with her brother about it			2
" we kind of live in a world where the minority teenager with the hoodie on means trouble , and unfortunately that 's kind of the way things are going now , " she told her brother			2
she told him he might not encounter racism now because he lives in a predominantly @entity52 community , but that when he leaves his neighborhood in @entity226 , @entity2 , that could change			0
" people are going to approach you differently , " she told him , giving a big - sister message she really wishes she 'd never had to give			0
conflicted about whether to have the conversation @entity231 , an @entity4 mother with three children , including a 15 - year - old son , said she and her husband are having " deep " conversations about whether they should talk with their kids about the case and the reactions to the verdict			1
" i think our fear is we 've raised them as much as possible in this society to be pretty much colorblind , " the co-creator of the blog @entity246 told me during an interview			0
" i mean , they are aware of their own heritage , but our fear is injecting thoughts into them that they do n't necessarily need to have			0
do we want them to view people with suspicion that do n't need to be viewed with suspicion ? " @entity231 worries that by telling her children to watch out for discrimination from certain people , they 'll end up doing the very thing she wants them to avoid -- racially profiling others			0
while she tries to figure out what to do , she says she and her husband will continue to rely on their strong @entity266 faith			0
" the only thing we can think of is to teach them christian values that are colorblind , " she added			0
@entity271 guilt @entity0 showcased a picture of her son on a post titled " this is my boy , " in which she confessed to feeling something else after the @entity279 verdict -- mom guilt			0
" i do feel a little bit of guilt because i did bring him into this world , him and his sister , and they 're going to have a lot of adversity still to come -- so should i have thought about that before i brought them into this world ? is it fair that i did that to them ? and that 's been in the back of my mind quite a bit since it happened , " she told me			0
when @entity9 ultimately has the talk with her son , i do n't know if she 'll share that she 's feeling some mom guilt			1
maybe if we 'd all start talking about race in all of our households -- not just the ones headed by african - americans -- moms like @entity9 would n't have anything to feel guilty about			1
