@entity4 president @entity2 's @entity1 pipeline headache is only going to get worse			1
democrats -- in their final weeks of controlling the @entity6 -- successfully blocked a bill tuesday that would authorize the pipeline from hitting the president 's desk			1
but the reprieve wo n't last long			1
incoming senate majority leader @entity12 immediately vowed that @entity1 would be " an early item on the agenda in the next @entity15			1
" @entity1 , a pipeline that would connect @entity18 's oil sands to the @entity20 coast , has been a rallying cry for the @entity22 throughout the @entity2 presidency			1
@entity22 have unsuccessfully tried to attach the issue to a host of bills over the years , including a payroll tax cut			0
poised to assume full control of @entity15 for the first time in nearly a decade , there 's pent up energy to finally approve legislation			0
and the @entity22 is working hard to build a coalition that even a presidential veto ca n't block			0
" if you do the math , we have 59 votes today , " said @entity36 @entity35 sen. @entity35			0
" but if you look at the new @entity15 , you can count four more right away ( and ) i think there may be others			0
" @entity35 , one of @entity1 's biggest backers , said he is aiming for 67 votes to override a likely presidential veto and said @entity22 could attach a @entity1 bill to a bigger measure @entity2 would be under pressure to sign , like a government financing bill			1
a veto - proof majority in the @entity6 next year is n't impossible			1
on tuesday , 14 @entity5 sided with @entity22 on @entity1			1
while some of those democrats wo n't be returning to the new @entity6 , the vote suggests a level of support in the party that must grab the attention of the @entity58			1
a growing number of @entity5 may be beginning to feel , privately at least , that the pipeline might be a battle that is becoming unsustainable			0
" they need to get this issue behind us once and for all , " said @entity62 , a longtime former communications aide to @entity5 majority leader @entity63 and sen. @entity64			0
significantly , the @entity58 has not yet specifically threatened to veto a bill seeking to approve @entity1			1
but it has left no doubt of @entity2 's distaste for the project			1
" it certainly is a piece of legislation that the president does n't support , " @entity58 spokesman @entity73 said tuesday			1
opinion polls have shown that majorities of @entity79 favor the pipeline , despite warnings of environmentalists it would swell carbon emissions and threaten fragile ecosystems on its route			0
oil industry leaders seem to believe that the political winds are now finally in their favor			0
" today 's vote in the @entity6 demonstrates a growing and high level of support for @entity1 , " said @entity91 , president and chief executive of @entity93 , which is behind the project			1
" @entity1 is not going away , the president will have to deal with it , if not now then next year , " said @entity99 , president and ceo of the @entity102 , which represents @entity79 oil and natural gas firms			2
" we will not give up until the pipeline is built			0
" but the environmental lobby and opponents of the project , who are still celebrating a major climate deal announced last week by the president in @entity115 , took heart from another delay for @entity1			2
" we 're more confident than ever that this pipeline will never be built , " said @entity118 , senior vice president of the @entity119			0
@entity5 sen. @entity121 , who led opposition to the bill , said she was proud her party had stood firm for the " health of the planet , " but admitted " i know the fight is far from over			0
" tuesday 's vote on @entity1 , the 1,200 mile stretch of a bigger @entity93 network was really a sideshow			1
party leaders permitted a poignant but futile attempt by @entity134 @entity133 to show voters in @entity136 , where oil is king , that she still has @entity6 clout before a runoff election			2
but politics is a cruel game			0
despite her personal appeals to colleagues with whom she has served for years in the @entity6 , @entity133 fell one vote short of putting the president on the spot			2
in many ways , @entity1 has become a cause that carries more political importance than commercial or environmental significance			2
for @entity153 groups in @entity2 's base , it has become the focal point of a struggle against the fossil fuels industry and a test of the president 's fealty to progressive principles			2
but @entity22 have repeatedly hammered @entity2 for opposing what they say is a project that will lead to thousands of jobs and boost energy resources			2
@entity2 was scathing about those claims last week			2
" i have to constantly push back against this idea that somehow the @entity1 pipeline is either this massive jobs bill for the @entity79 , or is somehow lowering gas prices , " @entity2 said			1
" it is providing the ability of @entity18 to pump their oil , send it through our land , down to the @entity177 , where it will be sold everywhere else			0
" @entity22 have a blunter message			0
house speaker @entity180 linked the administration 's @entity1 resistance to comments by @entity185 adviser @entity184 , who has come under fire for saying " the stupidity of the @entity79 voter " helped ensure passage of the law			0
vetoing a @entity1 bill , @entity180 warned on tuesday , " would be equivalent to calling the @entity79 people stupid			1

the @entity6 blocked a @entity1 bill from advancing tuesday
but the issue wo n't go away for @entity2
@entity198 : @entity1 will be " an early item " on 2015 agenda
