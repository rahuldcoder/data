-- injury is the biggest obstacle standing between @entity3 and a record - extending eighth @entity5 title , according to former grand slam champion @entity6			1
the @entity7 is competing at one of tennis ' four grand slams for the first time since last year 's @entity12 after spending seven months out of the sport with a knee injury			2
the 11 - time grand slam champion survived a scare in his opener at @entity5 before bouncing back to beat unseeded @entity19 @entity18 in four sets			2
cash , who clinched the @entity12 title in 1987 , reckons the right knee injury which kept @entity3 off the court is the biggest threat to his challenge in @entity27			1
" @entity3 is the most incredible clay court player of modern times , " said the @entity29 presenter			2
" i think the only question is how fit he is			0
" he certainly looks fit and he 's hitting the ball unbelievably well			0
" whether his knees will hold up if he gets stuck in a couple of five - set matches , he 's going to have tough matches at the @entity5 there 's no doubt about that			1
" he 's proven over his career that he can do it			0
he 's having such a long clay - court season that his fitness should n't be a problem			0
it 's hard not to put him favorite			0
" @entity3 defeated world no. 1 @entity48 in last year 's final to clinch an open - era record seventh @entity5 title			1
the clay - court crown is the only grand slam missing from @entity48 's cv and cash argues the @entity56 is still short of rivaling @entity3 on the surface			1
" on clay , @entity48 has his off days , he 's more up and down on clay than @entity3 is , " cash said of the six - time grand slam winner , who notched up a straight - sets win over @entity63 's @entity62 in the first round			1
" it makes it much more of a challenge having @entity3 there			2
" one man hoping to challenge for the title is @entity73 , who eased into the third round wednesday following a 6 - 2 6 - 1 6 - 1 win over @entity78 qualifier @entity76			1
@entity73 , seeded second , cruised to his 56th victory at the tournament , leaving him just two wins behind the record jointly held by @entity84 and @entity85			2
but @entity6 believes the 2009 winner , now 31 , faces a huge task to claim an 18th major title with age beginning to catch up with him			1
" @entity73 is starting to take quite a lot of time away from the game , " said @entity6			1
" he 's played so many matches , he certainly knows how to play			0
it 's just getting enough sharp matches going into a grand slam			0
" in the past he 's been able to whip through the early rounds			0
the way @entity73 plays , his style , he gives players so little time to breath he 's able to whip through the lesser players and it keeps him fresh for the big matches			1
" as we saw at the @entity105 , it 's the one time in his career he 's had to play back - to - back five - set matches , which is unbelievable			0
" he could n't get through that , @entity108 got the better of him			0
he is going have to start doing that now he 's getting a little bit older			0
there are a lot of ifs and buts , it makes it interesting			0
" @entity73 will play home favorite @entity119 in the next round after the @entity121 prevailed 7 - 6 7 - 5 5 - 7 0 - 6 6 - 4 against @entity19 's @entity122			1
@entity121 's hopes of a first men 's champion in 30 years remained on course with further victories for @entity128 and @entity129			2
@entity128 overcame @entity131 's @entity130 7 - 6 6 - 4 6 - 3 to set up a clash with compatriot @entity133 , while @entity129 battled past @entity135 's @entity134 6 - 7 6 - 4 7 - 6 6 - 2 to earn a third round tie with @entity137			2
there were also victories for @entity56 's @entity140 , @entity143 's number four seed @entity141 and @entity145 's @entity144			1
in the women 's section , @entity146 thrashed @entity149 6 - 1 6 - 2 to set up a last - 16 clash with @entity153 's 26th seed @entity151			1
the 15 - time grand slam winner has now gone 26 matches without defeat			0
third seed @entity157 will face 19 - year - old @entity19 @entity159 in the next round following a routine win over @entity162			1
@entity157 , who made the last - eight in @entity27 in both 2009 and 2011 , claimed a 6 - 1 6 - 4 victory to set up a clash with the 2012 junior champion			0
but there was bad news for @entity168 , seeded 10th , who was beaten 7 - 6 6 - 3 by world number 47 @entity170 .			0

@entity6 says injury biggest threat to @entity3 's *chances* of *glory* at @entity5
@entity143 's @entity3 aiming for eighth title at @entity5
@entity73 eases through to third round where he will face @entity119 of @entity121 .
