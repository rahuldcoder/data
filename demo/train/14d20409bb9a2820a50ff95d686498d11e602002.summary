@entity0 -- nearly 40 years after members of a @entity5 cavalry unit put their lives in peril to save 100 fellow soldiers trapped under blistering enemy fire in @entity10 , they received the @entity11 on tuesday			1
veterans watch tuesday 's ceremony , which recognized members of a @entity5 cavalry unit			1
it 's an honor their captain says is long overdue			2
president @entity17 awarded the citation for extraordinary heroism and conspicuous gallantry to 86 members of the @entity23 's @entity22 , @entity24 , @entity25			1
" these soldiers defined the meaning of bravery and heroism , " @entity17 said at a @entity27 reception honoring the group 's heroics			1
" it 's never too late			2
you can never say it enough			2
... we honor your service , and @entity5 is forever grateful			0
" on march 26 , 1970 , the 120 - member @entity22 volunteered to rescue an @entity5 infantry company surrounded by an overwhelming enemy force at a site on the @entity45 border called the @entity46			1
the enemy had survived hours of aerial and artillery bombardment and was expected to kill or capture the 100 @entity5 infantrymen in @entity50 within hours			1
the @entity5 were running out of ammunition and could not move because of heavy casualties			0
there were no available landing zones for medical and rescue helicopters to touch down			2
@entity56 heard of their plight on a radio and rode in with an infantry company to rescue their comrades			2
" @entity22 skillfully penetrated four kilometers of nearly impassable jungle terrain and unhesitatingly mounted a fierce assault directly into the heavily fortified @entity65 position , " the presidential proclamation states			1
when the battle was over , more than 70 @entity5 lay dead or wounded			0
for retired capt. @entity68 , who led the rescue , the award is for all @entity10 veterans , many of whom came home to an unwelcome and sometimes hostile reception			1
" the veterans of @entity56 feel very strongly that we stand in the stead of all veterans of the war of @entity10 , " @entity68 told @entity1 before the ceremony			1
" the fact is that we 're being singled out for a very distinct honor , a very rare one , but it is our conviction that on any day in any other jungle in @entity10 , nearly every @entity10 veteran would have been willing to assume the task that we assumed on march 26 , 1970 , when we earned the @entity11			1
" @entity68 had been trying to gain recognition for his men for the past seven years			0
initially , he felt deep disappointment			0
in 2003 , he discovered that the men he had recommended for decorations for their valor had not received those citations			0
eventually , 14 men received individual decorations			0
" my role in obtaining the @entity11 [ @entity11 ] -- or in helping to obtain the @entity11 -- among the 200 persons who were involved in this matter over a seven - year period , was to be in the unhappy position of discovering that the men who i had recommended for decorations had not been recommended , had not been awarded those decorations , " the retired captain said			1
" the result of that was that we got 14 men decorated for their valor , but 14 men out of more than 120 who were engaged in the battle on that fateful day were only a pittance , only a minority , of those who might have been honored			0
only a unit citation could honor all equally and impartially , and it was that task we set ourselves on nearly seven years ago			0
" he believes lack of popular support for the war had much to do with it taking so long for @entity56 to be recognized			2
" there 's little question in our minds that the unpopularity of the war in @entity10 is a major contributing factor to the reception these men received when they returned to the @entity5 and a major factor , in my opinion , in the silence that most of them have assumed since then , " @entity68 said			1
" why talk about something that most people do n't have a very high opinion of in all likelihood ? and if that is n't true , nevertheless , it 's what most of these men think			2
they were engaged in an unpopular venture that has bedeviled them for much of their adult lives			0
" now , the circle has been closed			0
" it 's a very elevating experience to see the men that i have not seen for 40 years since @entity151 in @entity10 , " the former captain said			1
" these are persons who have had success in life , and some have not had a lot of success in life , and to see how they 've turned out , how they look these days , and to know i 'll be with them in the @entity27 [ tuesday ] is a very fulfilling sensation for me			0
" for me , the sensation of being honored is one of having closed an important chapter on my life in a very fruitful and rewarding way			0
" the @entity11 is awarded to armed forces units of the @entity5 and allies for extraordinary heroism against an armed enemy on or after december 7 , 1941			1
the unit must display such gallantry , determination and esprit de corps under extremely difficult and hazardous conditions so as to set it apart from and above other units participating in the same campaign .			0
