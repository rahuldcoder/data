-- after just over a century of amicable relations , @entity1 has decided to cool its relationship with @entity4			1
gone are the days when @entity1 's leader , president @entity6 " @entity12 " @entity5 ( 2002 - 2010 ) , worked hard to strengthen @entity1 's partnership with @entity4 , defending @entity4 interests , sharing and learning from similar policy experiences over cafezinho			1
at a time when @entity1 has sought every opportunity to engage the international community and increase its influence as a mediator of conflict and peace , why has @entity1 's new president , @entity13 , refrained from strengthening the government 's ties with @entity4 ? the answer lies in @entity13 's personal experiences and geopolitical ambitions			1
as someone who experienced human rights violations first hand under @entity1 's military dictatorships ( 1964 - 1985 ) , @entity13 has been unwaveringly committed to human rights			1
she has made it crystal clear that she will not support @entity4 unless president @entity33 seriously addresses this issue			2
it 's striking how quickly two nations sharing similar economic and geopolitical interests have suddenly distanced themselves from each other and how @entity1 's decision may negatively affect @entity4 's relationship with other countries			1
what this also suggests is that amicable relationships between similar nations are never guaranteed and that a sudden change in government interests and aspirations can reverse historic partnerships while having broader geopolitical ramifications			0
for @entity13 , personal experiences matter			0
as a high school student from the city of @entity54 , she joined a @entity56 revolutionary group called @entity57 ( @entity58 ) , which sought to dethrone a military government that repeatedly violated civil and human rights			1
in 1970 , she was arrested , interrogated and placed in prison			0
while serving three years , @entity13 was periodically tortured : electrical shocks ran throughout her body ; she was incessantly beaten and called names ; she was hung upside down in between two steel platforms in what the military called the @entity68 , " parrots perch			0
" by the time of her release at 25 , she lost more than 22 pounds and her thyroid glands were nearly destroyed			0
needless to say , these horrific experiences had an enduring imprint on @entity13 's foreign policy views			2
indeed , when questioned about @entity4 during her campaign trail in 2009 , the first two words to often come out of her mouth were " human " and " rights			2
" the @entity4 regime 's atrocious history of killing thousands of dissidents , when combined with @entity4 court orders to have several people stoned to death for violating the law was viewed by @entity13 as " medieval behavior			1
" moreover , the regime 's decision to continuously throw political opponents in jail touched a sensitive nerve with @entity13			2
she made it very clear that before any business took place with @entity4 , @entity33 would need to stop these barbaric acts			0
yet this may prove difficult as @entity33 's political influence is often perceived as limited because of the presence of @entity4 's @entity103 ayatollah @entity102			2
being blamed and essentially ignored by @entity33 also did n't help			0
last year , @entity33 's media adviser , @entity104 , was quoted as stating that @entity13 had " destroyed years of good relations " between them			2
under @entity12 , @entity1 strengthened its political and economic ties with @entity4 through trade ( indirectly via @entity109 , estimated at $ 1.25 billion in 2010 ) and investment in @entity4 's oil sector			1
but when @entity33 visited @entity112 this january , he avoided meeting with @entity13			0
apparently he regrets having done so and plans to meet with her later this year			0
@entity13 's geopolitical aspirations have also caused her to step away from @entity115			0
after @entity12 joined @entity117 in 2010 to vote against @entity119 sanctions on @entity4 for failing to disclose information about its nuclear reactor site and ignoring secretary of state @entity123 's request to do so , it appears that @entity13 views distancing herself from @entity4 as a way to strengthen @entity1 's relationship with the @entity127			1
through these efforts , it seems that @entity13 is seeking to garner @entity127 support for a permanent seat on the @entity132 , as well as increasing @entity1 's influence in major international financial institutions , such as the @entity135			1
without @entity13 's support , @entity33 faces problems in @entity112			0
@entity4 has tried to strengthen ties with @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , and until recently , @entity1			1
and it 's opened six embassies in the region since 2005 , sans @entity1			0
but @entity33 can essentially forget about getting the support of @entity1 's close economic allies , such as @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149			1
@entity33 has also failed to live up to his promise of helping spur economic development in the region			0
at a time when he is trying to increase his legitimacy , given his hostile relationship with @entity156 and efforts to develop his nuclear reactors , @entity33 might not be able to afford losing his @entity160 friends , as they have defended him in the past and their support makes him look less isolated in the world			0
this freeze in relations with @entity1 , and @entity4 's gradual loss of allies in the region , also opens up further opportunity for the @entity119 to impose and enforce additional sanctions on @entity4			1
should this occur , @entity33 faces the specter of other allies questioning their relationship with @entity4 , which could have serious political and economic repercussions for @entity4			0
despite the rich history that these two nations share , it seems unlikely that @entity13 will want to strengthen her ties with @entity33			2
with aspirations to increase @entity1 's international influence and geopolitical importance , she will likely place more stock in strengthening her relationship with the @entity127 and other cooperative nations within the @entity119			1
unless @entity33 changes his tune on human rights and decides to fully abide by @entity119 rules , @entity4 's losses may go beyond @entity1			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			0

for a century , @entity1 has had amicable relations with @entity4 , says @entity194
he says president @entity13 has taken steps to distance @entity1 from @entity4
@entity13 , a torture *victim* , has raised concerns about human rights in @entity4 , he says
@entity191 : @entity1 's actions could strengthen ties with @entity127 , further isolate @entity4
