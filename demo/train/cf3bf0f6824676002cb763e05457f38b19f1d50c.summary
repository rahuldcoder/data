do n't laugh gallery snobs and car - haters : the automobile has vaulted from the streets to the lofty art world			1
even if automobiles are n't your thing , the @entity14 's bizarre wings and bubble cockpit are worth a peek			1
it 's among 17 " concept cars " on exhibit at @entity3 , @entity2 's @entity23 of these are one - of - a - kind			1
when you first walk into the exhibit , it 's clear these cars are n't designed for mere mortals			1
every car has a price , and these are worth millions			2
but in reality , the unique nature of this collection makes them priceless in a growing market			0
collectible car sales last year in the @entity37 topped $ 1 billion			1
money aside , this exhibit really exemplifies @entity37 's long and fiery hot love affair with cars			1
these rolling masterpieces were never intended to be mass produced			0
they were meant to be romanced , idolized , even worshipped			0
concept cars are marketing tools designed to trigger buzz and spur sales			1
you can be sure the @entity49 of @entity50 -- legendary designer @entity51 -- put just as much imagination into his jet - plane - looking @entity14 as old @entity49 did with that smirking @entity6			1
" these have got to be some of the world 's craziest , beautiful cars , " a visitor says to me with a grin as big as the grill - work on a stunning ' 51 @entity59 sitting a few feet away			1
a few examples : -- not a clown car : the 1970 @entity67 measures only 33 inches from its rooftop to the floor			2
-- @entity71 : a tiny electric - powered , plastic , bubble - on - wheels was created in @entity74 - occupied @entity5 in 1942			1
-- fabric exterior : a 2001 @entity76 wrinkles when you open its doors			1
see photos of these sweet cars parked against a wall in another exhibit room sits a green replica 1935 @entity84			1

it looks like something out of @entity91 's " @entity90			0
" " you can fetishize just about any detail on the @entity96 you like , from the grill to every bolt , " a man standing nearby says to me			1
this guy gets it ! we 're like kids in a candy store -- but nobody 's letting us have any candy			0

take for example the ' 59 @entity114			0
the thing looks like a silver rocket from a 1950s b movie			0
and it has futuristic safety features too			0
a radar - based anti-collision system is tucked inside the @entity124 's cone - shaped so - called " dagmar " headlights			2
two of the exhibit 's creators -- @entity127 and @entity128 -- showed me around a little			2
" in the past , the future was really cool , " joked @entity127 , who 's also been @entity132 's car writer for more than 25 years			2
@entity127 , the exhibit 's consulting curator , says these vehicles were imagined and built by designers with one goal : to get attention			1
@entity51 's been dead for 45 years and and he 's still turning heads			0
that 's called being way ahead of your time			0
as @entity127 puts it : " car designers are the rock stars of the automobile industry and they always have been			1
" when it came to car design , @entity51 pushed the industry to put style as a top priority , says @entity128 , the museum 's curator of decorative arts and design			1

-- its body is made mostly of expensive and super strong titanium			0
in 1954 @entity50 toted the @entity14 around the country as part of a traveling car show called the @entity177			0
the car " was so fast they only had one or two engineers who drove it at the proving grounds , " @entity127 says			0
" they used @entity184 , who was an @entity185 winner , to test it -- and even he never took it to its full potential			0
" it 's been suggested that @entity37 's century - long obsession with driving may die with the aging @entity194 generation			1
some experts say that @entity196 now in their 20s and 30s have little interest in owning cars , although sales among that group shot up in 2012			2
are we falling out of love with our cars ? the @entity3 museum is by no means the first to celebrate automobile design			2
back in 1951 , @entity209 's @entity208 opened an exhibit featuring eight cars described as elegant and exotic			1
more recently , @entity127 says , the idea has become a national trend , taking hold in places like @entity216 , @entity217 , and @entity218 , @entity219			0
