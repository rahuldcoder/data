-- after being sued for sexual harassment , a @entity2 executive is countersuing a former employee who leveled the original accusations against her			1
while the stakes of the sexual harassment claim are large , the underlying facts are actually quite common in this variety of litigation			1
former software engineer @entity11 filed a complaint against the executive , @entity14 , accusing her of coercing @entity15 into sex , and threatening to fire @entity15			2
@entity14 and @entity2 's defense is that @entity15 fabricated the entire story			1
@entity2 says she is an underperformer who received negative performance evaluations			1
there is perhaps no area of the law where we have failed to educate our citizenry more than sexual harassment			1
every lawyer has fielded a call from a potential client or family member , who believes fervently that they are victims of " harassment , " " discrimination " or a " hostile work environment			2
" that may be true			0
but , there is a huge difference between the common usage of these words and the legal definition			0
the vast majority of what employees personally consider " harassment " bears little resemblance to the kind of harassment that is legally actionable			2
@entity50 and state law , and in the @entity2 case , the @entity52 prohibits discrimination and harassment against an employee based on sex ( among other things )			1
there are two types of sexual harassment : hostile work environment sexual harassment and quid pro quo sexual harassment			1
hostile work environment is far more popular in that people often believe their workplace is hostile because their boss is a jerk , or he " has it out for them			0
" but , as the @entity71 has famously said , discrimination laws are not a " general civility code for the @entity74 workplace			0
" in the @entity2 case , the plaintiff is alleging the other kind of harassment			1
quid pro quo harassment is rarer , but potentially easier to prove			1
quid pro quo means " this for that			0
" simply put , a plaintiff must prove that a boss first made unwanted sexual advances or engaged in other unwanted sexual conduct			1
the plaintiff must also prove either that job benefits were conditioned on acceptance of those sexual advances or that employment decisions were based on his / her acceptance or rejection of the boss ' conduct			1
as one can imagine , it 's far more common for people to allege that they work in a generally sexually charged atmosphere than to allege that a boss made a concrete sexual advance , with a clear " or else " condition attached to it			2
from an evidence standpoint , however , quid pro quo harassment has more " smoking gun " potential			2
this is because a single instance of quid pro quo sexual harassment may be actionable			1
on the other hand , a single incident of hostile work environment sexual harassment will not justify a lawsuit , unless it 's really bad			1
it makes sense : if the boss sends you an e-mail saying : " meet me in the supply room for hanky - panky if you want that promotion , " then you 've established the overture with one e-mail			0
on the other hand , e-mailing or telling a lewd joke may be offensive in one person 's cubicle , but hilarious in the other 's			0
it makes sense that hostile work environment requires more severe , pervasive behavior , or else the legitimate claims would be overwhelmed by the " ca n't take a joke " plaintiffs			0
in the @entity2 case , the plaintiff has alleged actual sexual contact , which the executive denies			1
even in cases where there is a consensual relationship , there can still be actionable sexual harassment			1
this commonly happens where the office romance ends , and the demotions begin			0
so , even if there was a prior relationship , the plaintiff here could potentially prevail on a harassment claim			2
if @entity15 fabricated the allegations , as the defendants assert , then that would be a bold and brassy lie			0
but it would n't be unique			0
defendants in these cases frequently claim the plaintiff conjured up harassment just to save their job after substandard performance reviews			1
it becomes a high - stakes chicken - and - egg game : were the negative reviews a conspiracy to cover up the harassment ? or was the harassment made up to cast doubt on the reports of underperformance ? only time — and a jury — will tell			0
according to @entity176 law , all employers must take all reasonable steps to prevent harassment			2
at least some of those reasonable steps include that sign we 've all seen over the coffee machine in the break room , the one that basically says " @entity185 is @entity186			0
" in @entity176 , that 's a poster distributed by the @entity188			0
increasingly , it seems , we 're becoming a nation of anemic warning signs instead of concerted action			0
do we actually believe an executive planning to accost and grope his secretary in the file room will rethink his intentions after reading a poster hung over the water cooler ? @entity176 employers have a duty and a financial incentive to investigate these claims , because employers are often held strictly — or automatically — liable for a lecherous supervisor			0
@entity2 allegedly conducted an investigation and cleared @entity14			2
in @entity176 , an employer 's duties in responding to allegations include conducting an immediate inquiry , encouraging a written complaint , and protecting the employee from retaliation			0
it 's true that human resources is oft - criticized for siding with management against employees , but if @entity2 feels confident enough to keep backing @entity14 , that suggests its internal investigation revealed no wrongdoing			2
ultimately , actionable sexual harassment claims are a fraction of the total charges filed with the @entity223 and state agencies			1
this is because the public misunderstands the high burden on a plaintiff to prove sexual harassment			1
it takes a lot to prove an employer 's conduct transcended ordinary office nastiness into illegal harassment			2
the recent story of the @entity238 area employer who limits bathroom breaks to six minutes a day reminds us what we all already knew : there are a lot of lousy workplaces , evil bosses and cruel co-workers			0
unfortunately , the vast majority of us have a perfectly legal — if not pleasant — work environment .			0

@entity252 : a @entity2 exec is being sued for sex harassment , but denies charges
he says case *highlights* how poorly understood the sexual harassment law is
@entity252 : there are two kinds of sexual harassment cases , both *difficult* to prove
