" whether it 's a breakthrough or not will depend on the action on the ground			1
i can not predict what that will be , but we will work very hard to make it a breakthrough , because the people of @entity4 need us to break through with a much bigger humanitarian response			1
" @entity9 said the @entity4 government has signed a memorandum that describes the planned humanitarian response for the approximately 1 million people who need humanitarian aid urgently			1

" the announcement of the delivery of humanitarian aid came the same day that @entity4 announced that it was expelling diplomats from 11 countries			2
