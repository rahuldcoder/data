his ticket to the remarkable transition was a job with then - rep. @entity28			2
the two clicked and remained close as they shuffled through different @entity7 positions			0

but after @entity122 's re-election in 2004 , a divide was growing between the president and @entity13 as the administration faced a declining sense of patience among the public for the @entity185 and negative headlines over prisoner abuse			1
in 2006 , @entity122 forced @entity28 's resignation , despite strong disagreement from @entity13			1

" this is one of those kinds of situations			0
it is n't so much what you achieved , as is what you prevented			0
now you 've safeguarded against further attacks against the @entity4 i think that 's a major accomplishment			0
" the split between the president and his no. 2 deepened when @entity122 refused to pardon @entity188 , @entity13 's chief of staff , after a federal court convicted him of perjury , obstruction of justice and lying to investigators in the probe of the leak of the name of a @entity254 operative			1
