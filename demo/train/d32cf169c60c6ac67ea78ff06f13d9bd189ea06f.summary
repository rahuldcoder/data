@entity0 -- the success of @entity5 's anti-euro @entity3 in the first round of the country 's presidential elections thrust the far right into the headlines			1
a day later in the @entity13 , the refusal of the far - right @entity11 to back austerity measures led the @entity13 government to collapse			2
two very different scenarios , but with a common thread : the efforts of extremist parties to win support by plugging into popular discontent over the financial crisis , against the backdrop of a wider social unease and anti-immigrant sentiment			2
across @entity31 , anger at a perceived mismanagement of the economic crisis , and accompanying high unemployment , low growth and painful cuts , has seen the fall of half a dozen governments			1
@entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 are among them -- and unless president @entity41 pulls a victory out of the bag in the second round of voting on may 6 , @entity5 may be the next to see power change hands , this time in a shift to the left			1
@entity41 , for his part , says he will keep an open ear to the concerns of the @entity3 , led by @entity52 -- but rejected any notion of striking a deal with the far - right group			1
" there will be no pact with the @entity3 , there will be no @entity3 ministers , but i refuse to demonize the men and women who in voting for @entity52 expressed a crisis vote , a vote of anger , a vote of suffering and a vote of despair , " he said on @entity5 radio wednesday			1
" i have to take their message into account , i have to listen to them , i have to hear them and not hold my nose			0
" even so , will the region 's economic insecurity translate into greater gains for the far right ? @entity31 's far - right parties are definitely seeing a resurgence , according to dr. @entity80 , director of the @entity81 at the @entity82 , but the austerity crisis is only one part of the picture			1
he says the far right movement has been gaining ground for years , thanks partly to efforts to revamp its previously overtly racist and fascist image			0
this does n't mean that those racist or @entity93 - sympathizing elements do n't still exist within different countries ' far right groups , he said , but those at the top have often learned to present a more acceptable public face			2
instead of open racial attacks , they play up a threat to national identity and criticize multiculturalism , @entity80 said			0
on the campaign trail , @entity3 leader @entity52 called for @entity5 to leave the eurozone and restore its own currency , the franc , as well as criticizing its political integration into the @entity109			1
but her rhetoric also drew on an anti-immigrant , anti-muslim sentiment that has deep roots in @entity5 and elsewhere			1
a report by rights group @entity115 released monday highlighted the issue , saying @entity117 in @entity31 face discrimination in education , employment and religious freedom			1
this discourse was likely a factor in @entity41 turning the labeling of halal meat into an election issue , in a bid to win far - right supporters from @entity130			1
dr. @entity131 , a professor of political science at the @entity133 in @entity134 ( @entity135 ) who has also taught at @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity140 universities , said concern over immigration , law and order " and the feeling that things are n't what they used to be any more " are at the heart of support for @entity31 's radical right			1
@entity154 , as resistance to greater @entity153 political integration is known , is also on the increase , he said , and " there 's this anxiety about what will happen , a growing complexity and not much reassurance from either national governments or the @entity109			0
" coupled with a mistrust of the political elite , this has also led to a swell of support for the far right in @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity170 countries , @entity131 said			1
despite that trend , analysts caution against drawing sweeping conclusions from the far right 's success in @entity5			1
the @entity3 has been well entrenched in @entity5 's political life for decades , under @entity177 before his daughter @entity179 took charge last year , said @entity181 , of the @entity182			1
as such , its achievement in taking a fifth of the votes in sunday 's election , while notable , does not indicate a sudden rise to prominence for the far right , he said			1
socialist @entity190 , who is favored to win on may 6 , told @entity5 's daily liberation newspaper that he saw the strong showing for the @entity3 as an expression of people 's " social anger " rather than a firm adherence to the party 's more extremist views			1
it revealed a discontent particularly in rural areas and among working class voters , he said , with many feeling abandoned by the government			0
his job will be to persuade them that his left - wing party will listen to and answer their concerns , he said			0
@entity181 argued that a feature of recent ballots in @entity31 has been the readiness of voters to change their governments without turning to the political extremes , pointing to @entity36 's election last november as an example			1
" voters have been single minded across the eurozone in terms of expressing their dissatisfaction at how the crisis has been run by the government in charge , whatever their political hue , " he said			0
" but at the same time , they have sufficient confidence in their own political system to replace their governments with the mainstream political opposition			0
" if the major parties can convince voters that they hear their concerns , they are less likely to turn to the extremes of left or right , said @entity131			0
but @entity41 's failure to deliver on his promises on immigration during five years in power has undermined his support from the right - wing electorate despite his attempt to appeal to them in campaigning , @entity131 said			2
in the @entity13 , @entity181 said the impact of @entity13 politician @entity245 ' decision to withdraw his @entity11 's support for the government , triggering its collapse , will have only a temporary destabilizing effect			0
the economy will be central to the election of a new government , but the far right does not attract the same level of support as in @entity5			1
@entity256 , who wants a referendum on the euro , preferred to exit the coalition than lose political credibility by backing the painful cuts demanded by @entity31 , said dr. @entity262 , at the @entity263 in the @entity13			2
outgoing prime minister @entity264 urged lawmakers to act responsibly			0
" the economy is stalling ; unemployment is threatening to rise ; and the national debt is growing more quickly than we can afford			0
these are the facts , and we can not ignore them , " he said tuesday			0
debt - ridden @entity37 also faces an election on may 6 that hinges on the economy			2
the situation is very fluid there , but the far - right @entity278 party , with a couple of lawmakers in parliament , has lost ground to the ultranationalist @entity277 , which has a history of street violence , @entity262 said			0
opinion polls suggest @entity277 may pass the threshold of 3 % of the vote , which could give the party eight or nine mps in a parliament of 300 , he said			2
" they wo n't be able to make any difference , but it 's a very strong message when people vote for such an extreme party , " he said			2
at the moment , the most likely outcome is another coalition between the two main parties , @entity262 said			0
but if the radical groups manage to tie anger over the austerity measures mandated under the country 's international bailout to a sense of nationalism , they might pick up more disaffected voters			2
so , does the far right present a broader threat to @entity153 freedoms ? how extreme the anti-immigration debate becomes depends very much on the individual country , @entity131 said			0
farther east , a different strand of far - right thinking dominates in countries like @entity316 , @entity317 , @entity318 and @entity319 , he said			0
there , far - right groups poll around 10 % but tend to be more nationalistic in tone , he said , with anti-semitism and @entity324 views seen as more legitimate there than elsewhere in @entity31			1
@entity80 highlights the far right 's recent apparent moves to establish a pan-european cultural movement as the biggest risk			0
far - right groups from @entity170 , the @entity331 , @entity332 and @entity31 gathered last month in the @entity334 city of @entity335 for what they said was a rally to make their governments aware of the threat of @entity342 extremism			1
although it was dwarfed by a left - wing counterdemonstration , the protest was significant as an attempt by the far - right groups to create a common trajectory , he said			0
what remains to be seen is how much traction their extreme views can gain			0
" it 's clear that a large minority across @entity31 is n't comfortable with these things , demographic change and multiculturalism , " @entity80 said			2
" but what the far right offers is not something that many can accept			0

@entity5 's @entity3 gained *20* % of the vote in the first round of the presidential election
the far - right group is against *membership* of the euro and taps into anti-muslim sentiment
the far right has seen gains in @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity170 and elsewhere
analysts say the austerity crisis is only one factor in the far right 's rise in @entity31
