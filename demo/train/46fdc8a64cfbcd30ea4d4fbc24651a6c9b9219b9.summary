-- it 's always funny to get tweets and e-mails from followers of radio entertainer @entity5			1
none of them ever actually think of checking the facts out before they begin their ignorant , vile and rambling rants			0
i suppose that 's to be expected because all they are doing is following their feckless leader , @entity5			1
last week i took to @entity15 to express my disgust with the racist tweets sent to @entity18 , the @entity19 forward who scored the game - winning goal against the @entity23 in the pivotal game 7 of their first round matchup			1
@entity18 , who is black , should have been praised for great play			1
instead , he was insulted , ridiculed and called the n - word			2
as a result , i sent out the following tweets : -- " it 's no shock that a black hockey player is being called nasty vicious things for a game winning goal			1
only folks in denial about racism are			2
-- " the reality is that weak - minded punks hide behind anonymous comments on message boards and social media			2
-- " i had my arms crossed one day in an editorial meeting and was called " intimidating " & " threatening			0
" thinking while @entity46 , huh ? lol -- " i simply accept the reality that racism is in the dna of @entity50			1
and when that button is pushed , the true feelings come tumbling out ! -- " trust me , i know the inherent bigotry in ' we want our country back ' and ' he 's not like us ' or ' you have a different worldview			2
' " -- " why do i love a changing @entity50 ? because the walls are tumbling down ! one of the last bastions ? media			1
some folks are still holding on ! " -- " sports is great because talent ai n't subjective			2
i know from media history / experience that talent is irrelevant " -- " so to all of the soft / hard bigots , we ai n't going anywhere			2
keep hatin , we 'll keep on fighting & winning			2
but do know we know who you are ! " @entity5 was apprised of what i tweeted , so when a young listener called in , he brought up what i wrote and said : " @entity78 is a friend of @entity79 's and here is his tweet : ' i simply accept the reality that racism is in the @entity84 and when that button is pushed the true feelings come tumbling out			1
' " you asked me about racism and the media ; well , here is a black journalist at @entity0			2
i do n't know what this is relating to but again @entity94 , ' i simply accept the reality racism is in the dna of @entity50			1
' so here is a mainstream journalist who just lives with the assumption that this is a racist country			2
and in his case is first because he 's black , but he 's liberal first			2
" all liberals are liberals before they 're anything else , if they 're @entity106 , if they 're gay , female , male , they 're liberals first , @entity94			2
and that religion requires loyalty			0
you must have faith in them			0
they are the equivalent of your higher power			0
you must trust them ; you must let them manage your affairs			0
this guy tweeting today that racism is in the @entity84 , so we are as a country founded in a flawed , sinful way			0
we are unjust as a country , it 's immoral as a country , and that belief allows mr. @entity78 excuse to be able to have power over people , to be able to punish people he thinks are racist			1
" here is the key phrase out of all of the nonsense @entity5 spewed : " i do n't know what this is relating to			1
" had @entity5 and his crack research team bothered to get the context -- is that a bad disease going around lately ? -- he would have realized that i was speaking about the racial slurs against the black hockey player			1
that 's when all of the knuckleheads began to write me , and many said that i was inciting the issue by even bringing it up			1
several suggested that by ignoring racism , all will be well and it will just go away			0
really ? is that how it works ? look , there is no need for @entity50 to stop living in denial			1
race has been in the dna of @entity50 since its founding			1
formation of our precious @entity50 @entity164			1
the turbulence of the @entity169			0
pick the subject and we 've had to contend with the issue of race			1
i was only speaking truthfully to what so many @entity50 love to ignore			1
but hey , do n't believe me			0
here is what @entity179 star and former secretary of state @entity180 had to say about race in @entity50 on @entity183 's " @entity182 " in 2011 : " it is a birth defect with which this country was born out of slavery ; we 're never really going to be race blind			1
i think it goes back to whether or not race and class -- that is , race and poverty -- is not becoming even more of a constraint			0
" because with the failing public schools , i worry that the way that my grandparents got out of poverty , the way that my parents became educated , is just not going to be there for a whole bunch of kids			0
and i do think that race and poverty is still a terrible witch 's brew			1
" earlier she discussed the advancements of african - americans in the @entity50 -- whether it 's a ceo or president of the @entity50 -- yet even she concluded that " we 're never going to erase race as a factor in @entity50 life			1
" so i say @entity84			0
hmmm , is it really that different ? ignoring racism will do nothing to solve the problem			0
calling it out , speaking against it and educating others is what 's important			0
i find it hilarious that as an @entity46 , i 'm told to ignore racism			0
i could n't imagine telling someone @entity106 , " anti-semitism is n't a big deal ! stop harping on it			0
" the problem for too many of us is that we live in a world of denial			0
we choose not to confront the problem because that means looking inward and confronting how we were raised ; what our parents taught us ; or even having to check out friends for their bigotry			0
racism is n't just black or white			1
it can be a two - way street between any groups			0
i prefer to not be silent about it and call it out			0
have i experienced racism in my life , as well as in the media ? of course ! sure , i grow tired of having to fight battles that should have been long gone , but it is what it is			0
so @entity5 , i 'm not going anywhere			1
i wo n't back down			0
and when racism rears its ugly head , i 'll be right there standing up for righteousness and to rid our world of this wretched evil			0
got it ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity78			2

@entity78 *responded* to racist *reaction* to @entity18 's game - winning @entity263 goal
on his radio show , @entity5 *veered* off one @entity78 tweet to a *soliloquy* about liberals and race
@entity78 : @entity5 did n't even bother to note what the issue was before ranting
racism is in @entity50 's dna , @entity78 says , and @entity180 , for one , agrees
