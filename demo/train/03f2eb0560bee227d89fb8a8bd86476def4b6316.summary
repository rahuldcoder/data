@entity1 's deputy prime minister stirred controversy this week by appearing to suggest that the government could learn from the way that @entity5 changed its constitution			1
the remarks by @entity8 , who is also the @entity1 finance minister , provoked criticism from @entity1 's neighbors and a @entity12 organization in the @entity13			1
@entity8 , a former prime minister who has slipped up with verbal gaffes in the past , retracted the comments later in the week but refused to apologize for them or resign , saying they had been taken out of context			1
amid persistent talk in @entity1 about revising the country 's pacifist post-war constitution , @entity8 set off the controversy at a seminar monday , in which he said that discussions over constitutional changes should be carried out calmly			1
" @entity5 's @entity29 was changed into the @entity30 before anyone knew , " he said in comments widely reported by the @entity1 media			2
" it was changed before anyone else noticed			0
why do n't we learn from that method ? " @entity8 added : " i have no intention of denying democracy			1
again , i repeat that we should not decide [ constitutional revisions ] in a frenzy			2
" in 1933 , @entity41 's @entity40 turned the democratic @entity42 into a dictatorship using " a combination of legal procedure , persuasion , and terror , " according to the @entity13 @entity48			1
@entity41 used a fire that burned down the parliament building as a pretext to suppress the opposition through an emergency clause in the constitution			2
he then pushed through the @entity55 , which allowed him to govern without parliament and vastly extend the @entity58 ' grip on power			0
words that hurt @entity8 's apparent reference to those changes drew expressions of concern from the governments of @entity66 and @entity67 , two countries that suffered heavily under @entity1 imperial aggression during @entity70 , a conflict in which @entity1 was allied with @entity5			1
@entity72 and @entity73 are already wary of @entity1 's hawkish prime minister , @entity74			1
his campaign platform for elections last year included measures aimed at restoring @entity1 national pride such as revising the constitution to give the country 's self - defense forces the status of a regular army			0
@entity74 's party now has control of both houses of parliament			0
but it remains unclear if he will take on the difficult , controversial challenge of constitutional change , which would require a two - thirds majority in both chambers			1
@entity93 , a spokesman for the @entity66 foreign ministry , said wednesday that @entity8 's comments mean that other countries need to step up their vigilance over the direction in which @entity1 is headed			1
@entity66 and @entity1 are locked in a tense territorial dispute over a set of small , uninhabited islands in the @entity102 that has fueled nationalist sentiments in on both sides			2
@entity67 , meanwhile , called for " prudence " from @entity1 political leaders			2
" such comments definitely hurt a lot of people , " @entity107 , a foreign ministry spokesman , said tuesday			0
and the @entity112 , a @entity12 human rights organization based in @entity113 , demanded that @entity8 immediately clarify his remarks			1
" what ' techniques ' from the @entity58 ' governance are worth learning â€” how to stealthily cripple democracy ? " asked rabbi @entity115 , an associate dean at the center			0
" the only lessons on governance that the world should draw from the @entity5 is how those in positions of power should not behave , " @entity115 said in a statement tuesday			0
' great misunderstandings ' @entity8 responded thursday to the criticism over his comments , which also came from opposition lawmakers in @entity1 , saying he regretted that the remarks had " caused great misunderstandings despite my true intentions			1
" he said that he had referred to the @entity5 takeover of power as a " bad example " of constitutional revision because changes were forced through " in a commotion			0
" they should be done through calm debates instead			0
" i believe it is obvious that i feel extremely negatively about @entity5 , if you consider the entire context , " he said			0
" however , since these remarks have caused serious misunderstandings , i would like to retract them			0
" @entity1 cabinet secretary @entity150 told a news conference the same day that " the @entity74 administration definitely does not view @entity5 positively and i am sure vice prime minister @entity8 himself does not either			1
" it 's not the first time @entity8 's words have gotten him into hot water			0
at a meeting about social security reform and healthcare costs in january , he caused offense by suggesting it would be best for people on life support to " die quickly			0
" " @entity8 's comment about @entity41 and the implication that his example should be followed are utterly unacceptable , " the @entity165 , a daily newspaper , said in an editorial friday			2
" the remark is not something that @entity8 can get away with by simply retracting it			0
