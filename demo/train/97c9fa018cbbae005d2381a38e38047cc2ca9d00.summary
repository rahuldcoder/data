in the age of personalization , a @entity1 company is bringing 3d technology to the world of bespoke men 's footwear			1
inside the @entity9 store of the @entity10 -- just one of seven locations around the world -- a space - age platform sits among scaling shelves decked with beautifully made , traditional men 's shoes			1
next , customers are invited to sport a pair of bright yellow and green socks and stand on the @entity22 - like scanner as it produces a virtual 3d picture capturing the volume of their feet			1
after selecting the model and style from the store 's catalogue , the shoes are made by traditional craftsmen in @entity34 and delivered to the customer anywhere in the world in up to 6 weeks			2
@entity37 innovation what 's more -- shoppers looking to purchase another pair of shoes can easily order them online thanks to their 3d foot - scan stored in the company 's digital archives			2
" it enables me to stay in contact with customers all over the world , " says @entity48 , director of the @entity9 store			0
" they may have visited the store once in their entire lives , but they can shop with us forever			0
" the simplicity for the customer is also an added bonus , explains @entity62 : " it allows you to shop online and know exactly what you 're going to get , whereas if you go to other e-commerce sites you may have to buy two or three sizes and return two of them			0
it does n't make a lot of economic sense			0
" the digital scan gives shoppers a custom fit made in seconds at virtually no cost allowing them to skip the made - to - wear tradition of having a wooden model made of their feet -- an expensive and time consuming process			1
in turn , the savings is passed on to the customer			0
the @entity10 's footwear costs around $ 640 , about half of what a traditional shoemaker might charge			1
luxury embraces digital by combining a tech - savvy business model with old - school artistan tradition , the @entity1 company is making bespoke craftsmanship accessible to a customer that craves authenticity in the digital era			1
" it 's a sector that does n't really embrace change and that includes technology and e-commerce , " says @entity100 , a senior analyst at @entity101			1
but , she says , across the board , technology is becoming an increasingly big feature in the luxury goods sector			1
ceo @entity110 says that using technology to streamline a traditional business model has as many advantages for the business as it does for the customer			2
the benefit of made - to - measure footwear , he says , is that it involves minimum waste			2
" we make the shoes one by one when an individual customer orders them			0
if we do n't sell many of a certain style , it does n't matter			0
" he 's convinced that tradition with a tech twist will catch on : " we have adopted this technology early , but i have no doubt that other companies will catch up quickly			1
" and the demand for bespoke is growing , says @entity133 , head of the @entity134 and @entity135 : " for many years consumers have been rather passive about what they 'll buy , but now there 's a whole generation of new consumers that say ' i will buy less , but i will buy better			2
' " there is still an important place for bespoke in this world of ready - to - wear , says @entity48			0
" we had a gentleman in the other day and he ordered one shoe in a size 9 and one in a size 7			0
where else would you go ? the only alternative is to buy two pairs of shoes			0
" a majority of the population , he points out , have different sized feet and , by bringing together high - technology and traditional craftsmanship , the @entity10 is making high - end , made - to - measure shoes a more attainable dream .			1
