-- " @entity0 ? " give me a break			1
if you 've been to the movies lately , you may have seen a trailer for a @entity8 film with that name			2
it 's the title of the first book in a two - volume memoir by former stock swindler @entity13 , upon whom the film is based			1
the trailer appears to portray @entity13 as a player in a small part of lower @entity17 that 's become the world - famous icon of capitalism			1
it opens with dizzying shots of famous symbols such as the @entity25 sign and the bronze charging bull statue , a favorite photo backdrop for tourists			0
there 's a hilarious scene with @entity13 , played by @entity31 , hamming it up with one of his early mentors , played by @entity36 , at a window table in a restaurant with fabulous city views			1
you think @entity25 big shots might go there			0
and if you have n't caught on yet , the camera moves to @entity13 on his yacht , which happens to be bobbing in a harbor with the @entity48 in the background			1
" @entity0 of @entity25 " might turn out to be great entertainment , which is what @entity51 is for			1
and maybe @entity13 really did dock his 167 - foot yacht near the @entity54 at least once before it sank in a @entity56 storm			2
but do n't fall for the scenery			0
as @entity58 , his second wife , said during an argument portrayed in his memoir , " my husband , the @entity0 ! it 's almost too ridiculous for words			1
" for starters , almost all of @entity13 's lucrative criminal career took place in a less glamorous locale than those opening scenes			1
after seven months in his first job in the securities industry , pitching stocks over the telephone for a genuine @entity25 - based firm , @entity13 left there after stocks crashed in 1987 and headed east			2
his intention , he says in the memoir , was to bring " my own version of @entity25 out to @entity81 instead			0
" the expressway to his schemes to convey what @entity13 's professional life in this " version of @entity25 " was really like , the film trailer should start with shots of @entity90 traffic and segue to a scene in a @entity93 diner near @entity94 , @entity81 , population about 3,000 , near the border with @entity97			1
@entity13 's firm , @entity98 , was headquartered there			1
in his memoir , he says he had breakfast at the diner with another mentor three times a week			0
employing hundreds of brokers , @entity13 's @entity81 version of @entity25 was a huge , infamous example of a type of thievery known as a " pump and dump " scheme			1
in the scheme 's first stage , @entity13 and his partner , @entity111 , secretly got control of stock in small companies that @entity117 took public			1
then @entity117 brokers , working banks of telephones , called individuals throughout the @entity122 , using scripts that included wildly optimistic predictions about how high the stocks ' prices would go			0
when enough people had finally been fooled into buying the shares , the price really did rise as a result			0
ignoring instructions from ordinary investors who wanted to sell , @entity13 and other insiders cashed in at the peak , dumped all their stock into the market for a huge profit , and left the people they 'd duped holding nearly worthless stock			1
trying to impress potential victims , brokers at @entity141 and many other so - called " boiler rooms " said they were calling from " @entity25			0
" in fact , their only real connection with @entity25 was that some of the stocks they sold were traded at exchanges there , and the boiler rooms ' " clearing firms " ( companies handling the mechanical details of stock trades ) might be there			2
altogether , individual investors , many of them retirees , were cheated out of about $ 250 million by @entity98 by the time regulators managed to close it in 1996			1
there was a book in 1929 called " @entity0 of @entity25 , " based on a b - movie by that name about a fellow who cornered the market in copper			1
that helps me believe someone really did call @entity13 that at least once			2
but during more than a dozen years following @entity13 's story for @entity172 , i never once heard him referred to as " @entity0			1
" not by his friends , enemies or ex-employees , and certainly not by the legions of regulators trying to close him down			0
@entity178 , director of the @entity179 , headed a long investigation of @entity117 in the 1990s			0
he told me he had n't heard it either			0
he thinks @entity13 invented the " @entity183 " nickname himself			2
" i have to give him credit , " @entity178 says			0
" he 's not stupid			0
" not ' @entity183 , ' but something else ... a word i did often hear to refer to boiler - room operators was something farther down the food chain -- " cockroach			0
" the brokers themselves used it			0
@entity13 made it into a verb when he testified in the trial of @entity117 's accountant years after @entity117 closed			1
after it became obvious that regulators were about to shut @entity117 down , he , @entity111 and some advisers decided to " close @entity117 's doors ... and cockroach , " he said			0
in his memoir , @entity13 explains what he calls the " @entity206 , " saying it meant setting up satellite firms when regulators got close to a big boiler room , moving brokers there in batches and continuing to operate as before at the new location			2
for regulators , he wrote , closing a crooked brokerage suddenly became " like stepping on a cockroach and squashing it , only to find 10 new ones scurrying in all directions			0
" it 's a real pity that the " @entity183 " movie trailer does n't give you some idea about who these victims were			1
decidely middle class , unsophisticated investors , they included @entity230 and @entity231 , 88 - year - old @entity233 residents			0
they lost $ 252,000 in 1994 after a @entity117 broker replaced their holdings with worthless stocks without authorization			0
@entity238 , a @entity239 veteran , lost $ 62,000 in a 1996 @entity117 swindle , and had to take out a second mortgage on his house to afford care for his ailing mother			0
when he saw the fictional movie " @entity246 " a few years later , @entity238 said , " i just about cried			0
" many of the swindled await their money despite @entity13 's lucrative movie and book deals , and earnings from a new career as a motivational speaker , many of these victims are still waiting for restitution			1
when @entity13 was sentenced in 2003 to four years in prison , judge @entity257 ordered him to pay about $ 110.4 million to a victims fund , in installments equal to 50 % of his monthly gross income , after his release from jail			1
if any major changes in his financial circumstances took place , the percentage @entity13 had to pay could be adjusted up or down			2
after i asked for an update on the fund in early october , lawyers in the office of @entity270 , @entity122 attorney for the @entity271 , replied that @entity13 had only contributed about $ 11.6 million to the victims ' fund so far -- about one - tenth of the required total			1
in a court filing with many details about @entity13 's current income whited out , @entity270 's office asked @entity257 to find @entity13 in default , saying that according to his tax returns and other available information , the payments he has been making are " insufficient			1
" they said that in 2011 , for instance , @entity13 paid $ 21,000 in restitution , although he made more than $ 1 million for the motion picture rights to his memoir , as well as more income from a motivational speaking corporation he half - owns			1
@entity13 's attorneys responded that he does n't deny he still owes money to victims , but that his position is his obligation to pay 50 % of his income to them ended when his term of " supervised release " from prison expired in april 2009			1
they said that for the past two years , he 's been trying to arrange a " forbearance " agreement with the government to " pay 100 % of the profits of the movie and the two books , " but that his offer has been turned down			2
" before you accuse me of anything , you should learn the facts , " @entity13 said in an e-mail last week			2
" i have been trying to settle this case forever and have been completely stonewalled			0
i can even show you the settlement offer from the government , on their letterhead , asking for only 50 % of my books , after i offered 100 %			0
" on friday afternoon , the government asked to withdraw its pending motion to hold @entity13 in default on his payments to victims			2
oral argument in the case had been scheduled to begin nov. 22			0
in a court document , @entity326 , assistant u.s. attorney for the @entity271 , said the delay would give both sides " an opportunity to explore a resolution " of certain issues , and that " mr. @entity13 joins in this request			2
" the movie , originally scheduled for mid-november , is now set for release on christmas day			0
meanwhile , the website for " @entity13 's @entity337 , " his motivational speaking company , features a video of @entity31 doing a bit of speaking himself			1
" there is nothing quite like @entity13 's public speaking and his ability to train and empower young entrepreneurs , " @entity31 says			1
" @entity348 stands as a shining example of the transformative qualities of ambition and hard work , and in that regard , he is a true motivator			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity358 .			2
