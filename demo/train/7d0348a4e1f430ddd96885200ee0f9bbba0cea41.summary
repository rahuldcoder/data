-- the night before she was killed on the streets of @entity3 , the woman the world would come to know simply as @entity6 had a dream			1
" there was a war going on , " she told her mom the next morning , " and i was in the front			2
" @entity6 's mother had joined her in the street protests that erupted after @entity14 's disputed june 12 presidential election			1
but on that fateful morning , she told her daughter she could n't go with her			2
as @entity6 prepared to leave , the mother was filled with anxiety			1
" i told her to be very careful , and she said she would			2
" more than four months after @entity6 's death , her mother , @entity19 , described the pain her family has endured and how grateful they are to millions across the world who have hailed @entity6 as a martyr -- a symbol of freedom for @entity14			1
she spoke with @entity0 by phone in her native @entity30 from her home in @entity3 a few days ago			1
" as a message to everyone , i really want to thank the whole world , " she said			2
" and i do n't really know how to thank them , so i ask of you : please find the right words for me			0
" i ca n't tell you how much it has warmed our hearts , how much it 's helped us			2
" there is a @entity30 expression that describes a grieving person 's need to talk about the pain in her heart , to empty her soul			2
and that 's what this is : a mourning mother who for months has wept and cried -- and remained silent about her daughter 's killing , until now			1
" this is a pain that will never heal , " she said in a gentle , hushed tone			0
watch mom mourn the " look in her eyes " ' i need not worry ' on june 20 , @entity64 , 26 , headed to @entity3 's @entity65 , where thousands of protesters gathered			1
clashes were particularly intense that day , with demonstrators and riot police squaring off			0
@entity6 , accompanied by her music teacher , called home with frequent updates			1
" @entity74 , there are just too many clashes going on			0
there are a lot of police and forces around			0
" tear gas was lobbed at the crowd			0
@entity6 headed to a medical clinic to get her eyes washed			1
" my eyes are really burning hard , " she said			0
twenty minutes later , @entity6 's mom reached her again			1
" she said she was on her way back home -- that i need not worry			0
" @entity6 told the same thing to her aunt and uncle , who also called to check up on her			1
wearing blue jeans , a black shirt and white sneakers , @entity6 walked toward her car , parked on a side street not far from the heated protests			1
" it did n't occur to her that anything was going to be different , " her mother said			0
then , @entity6 was killed			1
a single bullet struck her chest			0
recalling that day , her mother paused in the hourlong interview			0
the family , she said , has gone back to the scene and retraced @entity6 's movements			1
" she was only 26 steps from her car			0
" those were 26 steps @entity64 never had a chance to take -- the difference between returning home to her family and becoming a symbol of a greater struggle inside @entity14			0
' she was absolutely beautiful ' while millions across the globe were transfixed by @entity6 's death , captured on video , her family entered a traditional seven - day grieving period			1
her parents ' house was too small to host everyone ; they gathered at @entity6 's older sister 's home			1
the family , @entity6 's mother said , was barred from holding a memorial service			1
" i did see @entity6 when her body was being washed before burial , " she said			1
" when her body was covered in the white shroud for burial , when they uncovered her face , i saw her			0
she was absolutely beautiful -- with a smile , a beautiful smile			0
" it was during the seven days of mourning , around the third or fourth day , that a relative told her about the video of @entity6 's death , by then widely watched on the @entity143			1
the mother did n't watch it that first week			0
" but when i returned home , i did see the video , " she said			0
" it was enormously painful			2
so painful that i 've never been able to watch it again all the way through to the end			0
" it was the moment of seeing her give her life , the life leaving her body			0
the look in her eyes at that moment			0
i wake up with that look in her eyes every morning ; i go to bed with the image of that look in her eyes every evening			0
" she continued , " i want to say that the moment that bothers me the most -- that bothers me terribly -- is the moment @entity6 got shot			1
that 's because @entity6 was an extremely brave person			1
ever since she was a child , she was brave and fearless			0
so that moment when she got shot , i saw it in the video , she could n't believe it -- that she had taken a bullet			0
so much so that she takes a look at her body			0
and when she sees she 's been shot , she takes a few steps backwards and then falls			2
the only words she managed to utter was : ' teacher , i 'm burning			0
' and people said she passed within 44 seconds			2
" the mother visits @entity6 's grave every friday			1
she 's heartened that even now , throngs of people still greet her -- " it 's as though she just passed away			1
" she carries with her a painting of her smiling daughter that she received as a gift			2
" people go and write on her grave in red ink the word ' martyr , ' " she said , " and then the authorities go and wipe it off			1
" blog : behind the scenes with @entity6 's mom she said her daughter 's killer is still at large , but she 's confident the person will be found and tried in court			1
" i am waiting for that day			0
" " i saw @entity6 as a martyr from the start			1
@entity6 was a martyr for her homeland			1
" a ' caring ' debater long before @entity6 became a household name , she was a " very excited girl " who always had answers for everything			1
" she was very well tempered and very friendly and very emotional and caring -- extremely emotional and caring , " her mother said			0
" she was never the type of girl who would submit to force			0
" in their last face - to - face conversation , the mother and daughter debated the political climate inside @entity14			2
" we had a hearty debate and discussion , " her mother said			0
@entity64 's favorite activity was aerobics			2
she also liked to sunbathe at a local swimming pool			0
her final meal was her favorite dish : pan kabob			0
@entity6 was divorced , her mother said			1
after the divorce , @entity6 tried to get a job , but it was impossible			1
every time she went for interviews or filled out an application , she felt people looked at her differently			2
" so she decided she was going to stay home			0
" that home is now adorned with photographs of @entity6			1
one of her last gifts to her mom was perfume , a birthday present she cherishes			2
" on a daily basis , when i want to think of her , i ca n't tell you how hard it is			0
it 's too hard to be able to speak			2
" @entity6 , the middle of three children , shared her room with her younger brother			1
he played guitar and violin			0
@entity6 loved the piano , and wanted him to learn to play			2
just days before she was killed , she picked out a piano for him			0
he has since purchased it			0
" when he comes home from work every evening , " the mother said , " he plays the piano and sings in @entity6 's memory			1
and that 's what keeps us going every evening			2
" she hopes the people of @entity14 and the world will hear her story -- @entity6 's story -- and never forget her daughter			1
" i just want to thank you for remembering her			0
it 's that which stays with me , and it 's her eyes , the look in her eyes in those last moments that had a story to tell that i can never forget , " she said			2
" @entity6 has made me enormously proud			1
" it is tradition in @entity14 to give away personal belongings of a loved one after they die			0
but @entity6 's bed , her makeup stand , her photographs -- everything that was hers -- remains untouched			1
the reason : @entity6 appeared in her sister 's dream and told her not to part with anything			1
