-- over 300 miles from the nearest ocean , competitors in one of the world 's fastest sailing races are battling against a moody wind			1
a small army of boats -- if you can call them that -- carve across the @entity12 desert			1
a stream of sand billows behind , caking each competitor 's face in fine , white grit			1
" it 's like @entity22 has her foot on the throttle , " says @entity18 , who has been racing these peculiar yachts - on - wheels since the 1970s			1
" the speeds that you go at -- sometimes 100 miles per hour -- means that you really need to stay on top of it or you could have a major accident , " he tells @entity0 's @entity26 show			1
" but that 's part of the challenge			1
" dramatic backdrop each year the dried lake - bed of @entity36 is transformed into a fantastical racetrack for the @entity38			1
over 170 " sailors , " from countries as far flung as @entity44 and @entity45 , converge on the dramatic landscape that stretches flat as a mirror beneath the sweltering summer sun. " when we first came through the mountains , we saw these beautiful big rocks , and the west end of the lake was just glass smooth , " competitor @entity46 says of the spectacular setting			2
" so smooth you can actually see the reflection of your boat on the dirt , " adds fellow racer @entity53			2
situated around 30 miles from the closest town of @entity60 -- which has a population of just 200 -- @entity36 appears like a scorched land on the edge of the world			2
and when the temperamental wind whips up the sand , forcing spectators to shield their eyes and run for cover , you 'd be forgiven for thinking these otherworldly sailboats were ghost ships on the horizon			2
desert inventors competitors arrive in campervans loaded with their desert - racing machines , and work late into the evening tinkering with their speedy designs			1
" you know what a sailboat is ? well it 's kind of like that , but you 're racing on dirt , with wheels , " racer @entity83 says matter - of - factly			1
" the amount of time you spend in what i call a ' dirt boat coma ' with a glazed look in your eye , thinking about your next great innovation and hoping it works ... " he trails off with a faraway look			2
in their everyday lives , these enthusiasts might be farmers or plumbers who work on their designs in garages back home			2
the boats differ dramatically according to the class they 're racing in -- from basic buggies with sails , to something resembling a futuristic bobsled with wheelie arms extended either side			1
" just after the start , you push , you run , you jump into the yacht , and you lay down completely , trying to be the lowest you can , " explains racer @entity113			0
" you 're hunkered down in the boat , you get nice and low , and you just get a beautiful view of the horizon , " says fellow competitor @entity117			0
the high - tech designs have come a long way from the 1970s , when adventurous land sailors tested out their hybrid designs everywhere from @entity125 beaches to @entity127 deserts			0
" it 's progressed from small , simple , two - framed vehicles , to pretty exotic ones with carbon fiber bodies and wing masts , " explains @entity18 , who previously raced go - karts and catamarans			0
" then there are some classes which were designed in the 1970s and have n't changed at all			0
" need for speed the majority of world championship winners hail from the @entity140 but there 's also a good showing from @entity125 competitors , who are perhaps better used to racing on more rugged beach terrain			0
for @entity147 @entity146 ( @entity149 ) president @entity148 , there 's a good reason why he keeps coming back year after year			0
" it 's the speed			0
it 's just so much fun to go that fast with the wind			0
you 're in a boat , making all the decisions you 're in control of everything			0
" and heck , " he adds , " who does n't like going 80 miles an hour ? " debate : will ' robo - ships ' be the end of sailors ? learn : @entity165 sets to right @entity166 ' wrong '			0
