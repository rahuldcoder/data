-- it seems impossible for @entity2 to put a decent camera into anything but the @entity5 , and despite many hopes , both cameras in the ipad 2 are about as rudimentary as you could get without having to load a roll of film in there			0
in fact , the @entity7 2 's camera has more in common with the low - res camera in the @entity16 than it does to the rather excellent one in the @entity5			1
@entity0 : @entity18 camera does n't suck the specs for the @entity7 's rear - facing camera only lists one number : 720p			1
that should mean 1280 x 720 pixels , which gives a megapixel figure of 0.92 , clearly useless for stills			1
however , flip over to the @entity16 camera specs and we see the following : " hd ( 720p ) up to 30 frames per second with audio ; still photos ( 960 x 720 ) with back camera			1
" yes , the @entity16 shoots stills at an even lower resolution than video , most likely because the wide - screen movie format is squared - off to shoot stills			2
the stills it produces are just shy of 0.7 megapixels , or about the same resolution as an early 1990s - era digital camera			0
wired : hands - on with @entity2 's skinnier , faster @entity7 it 's extremely likely that the @entity7 2 and the @entity16 share the exact same camera ( although we wo n't know for sure until @entity49 tears one open to see )			1
it seems that it will be fine for movies , and bad for photos			2
then again , with the camera connection kit you can always just import images from a real camera			0
and for taking notes , snapping menus or grabbing pictures before grunging them up and sending them off to @entity64 , it 'll do the trick			0
wired : why the @entity5 camera is so promising still , for a device that costs a minimum of $ 500 , it would be nice to have a better image sensor , rather than these bottom - of - the - barrel ones @entity2 insists on using			0
will we ever get one ? it 's starting to look rather doubtful subscribe to @entity0 for less than $ 1 an issue and get a free gift ! click here ! copyright 2011 @entity76 .			0
