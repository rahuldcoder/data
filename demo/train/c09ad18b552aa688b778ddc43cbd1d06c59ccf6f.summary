-- more than 50 years ago , military brass sat down the couple who 'd become @entity5 's parents			1
they told them how horrible it would be if a black man and a white woman wed at a time when interracial marriage was illegal in parts of the @entity14			1
six years later , in 1967 , they celebrated when the @entity18 ruled in loving v. @entity19 that no state could stop different races from marrying			0
for years , @entity5 knew their anguish , their struggle , their determination			2
today , she knows their joy			0
@entity28 thought of her parents three years ago as she tearfully filled out a license to wed her partner @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity33			1
the seaside enclave was more than 2,500 miles away from their home state of @entity37 , where same - sex marriage has been banned			1
she cried more tears of joy wednesday , when the @entity18 struck down part of the @entity42 in ruling the federal government can not treat legally married gay and lesbian couples differently from heterosexual ones			2
' what about us ? ' ask couples who still ca n't marry " this must have been what @entity50 felt like when the @entity53 case was decided , " @entity28 said			1
" it was the beginning , and it was the acknowledgment they had the right to marry , they had the right to be together			0
" @entity28 and @entity31 have n't kept secret the fact they 're lesbians , or that they 're together			1
they joke about being the only married couple on the faculty at @entity66 's @entity65 and are grateful for their colleagues support			1
it has n't been easy , though			2
in november 2008 , @entity37 voters passed an amendment to the state constitution defining marriage as " only a union of one man and one woman			1
" that meant -- as it does for others in 37 states where same - sex marriage is not or will soon not be legal -- @entity28 and @entity31 were , in legal terms , little more than roommates			1
even after their @entity33 nuptials , @entity28 fought through health ailments and worried that if something happened to her , @entity31 would n't get her @entity90 benefits			1
" as we start to get older and think about retirement and things like that , all of these issues come into play , " @entity28 said			2
what 's next for gay rights ? wednesday ended up being a " little crazy " in the best possible way with laughter , tears and relief			2
they breathed easier not having to worry about things that they might have the day before			0
they rejoiced the federal government finally will recognize their union as valid			0
they celebrated that gay rights had come so far , and that they 'd been around to see it happen and to talk to the world about it			0
" this is a great thing , " @entity31 said			0
" and it helps us share our stories			0
" they 've been doing that at @entity66 for years , where @entity28 said students she 's never met regularly show up at her door , asking for help figuring out how to come out to their families and friends			1
others come to them fearful of getting outed at work , and theoretically fired , given that most states still do n't have laws that prohibit terminating someone because they are gay or transgendered			0
" i 'm out , and i 'm there for them , " @entity28 said			2
" ... i serve in a lot of different ways			0
" rulings hailed as historic having the chance to help people is one reason the pair wants to stay in @entity37			2
it may be easier to go elsewhere , to a state like @entity144 or @entity145 , where there would be no questions about whether they 'd get the same rights as heterosexual couples			0
wednesday 's @entity18 ruling , notably , did n't mandate everyone recognize same - sex marriages : that 's still up to the individual states			1
it does n't change anything in @entity37 , for instance			2
but @entity159 need to know that there are happy , productive same - sex couples in their midst , not for them all to go elsewhere , @entity28 said			1
it 's harder for them to be foreign or an unknown if they work down the hall , live down the block or shop at the same store			0
besides , @entity28 said , her parents did n't teach her to give up when they steadfastly insisted on getting married , whatever anyone else thought			1
" some states may be easier to live in , " she said			0
" but i ca n't let my mom and dad down			0
" @entity0 's @entity174 contributed to this report .			0

@entity5 's father was black , her mother was white when they married in 1961
she says they wed despite *pressure* not to do so as an interracial couple
@entity28 is now married to her partner , but their same - sex marriage is n't valid in @entity37
her parents ' story *encourages* her to keep fighting for equal rights
