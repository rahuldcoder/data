-- " @entity3 " may be daytime 's most colorful show			1
the greenroom is literally painted a soft mint green			2
deep blues adorn the high - tech , mechanized set			2
audience members are decked out in numerous brightly hued cardigans			2
and monday , the show 's stage was bathed by sultry red lights in honor of @entity16 's guest — @entity17 , a.k.a. " @entity18 " author @entity17			1
( " @entity18 " hero @entity18 does his dirtiest deeds in a chamber known as the @entity22			2
) the kinky theme did n't stop with that crimson glow			2
for one day only , the usually demure " @entity3 " logo was adorned with a pair of handcuffs naughtily looped around the " k. " and @entity16 herself drew whoops from the audience when she appeared at the top of the hour in a sleeveless black leather dress and sky - high stilettos — to the tune of @entity38 's " s&m , " naturally			1
" relax — this wo n't hurt at all , " @entity16 joked , introducing herself as our " mistress " for the day			0
what would @entity42 think ? ! given all this , audience members probably expected @entity17 to emerge wearing an " @entity47 " - style rubber fetish suit — or at least to be as boisterous and open as @entity18 's inner goddess			1
in actuality , @entity17 is a shy , normal - looking lady in her 40s who speaks so softly that i had difficulty hearing her from backstage — not exactly what you 'd expect from a woman who has sold 30 million copies of her erotic novels in just six months			1
and honestly , @entity17 still seems pretty flabbergasted by all the attention her work is getting			1
" it 's ridiculous , " she said in wonder when asked about the @entity18 phenomenon			0
despite the fact that her books have been credited with single - handedly saving @entity71 from oblivion , @entity17 ' lifestyle has n't changed much since her bestselling trilogy was published			1
her teenaged sons still tease her , though they 're also supportive of ( and a little embarrassed by ) her success ; her only major purchase has been a new @entity77			0
" i know how to live , ladies ! " she joked after @entity16 mentioned the car			0
and yes , she asked whether the backseat was big enough to have sex in before making a down payment			0
@entity16 's audience ate it all up , howling with laughter at a video clip from a @entity18 - themed exercise class and nodding thoughtfully when a specialist from the @entity90 called the books " the sex version of the cupcake			0
" ( it made sense in context			0
) when it came time to pose their own questions , they asked whether @entity17 has plans to write something from @entity18 's perspective ( answer : maybe ) , if she 's got any advice for those looking to dip a toe into the world of @entity110 ( " i would say start with a tie , honestly " ) , and who she 'd pick to star in the upcoming film adaptation of the series ' first novel			1
@entity17 was coy about this last query , saying only that she has three unnamed actors in mind for @entity121 and four in mind for @entity123			1
but @entity3 's audience has a few casting ideas of its own : according to @entity130 polls , they 'd like to see @entity132 alum @entity131 as the naive college grad and @entity135 hottie @entity134 as the handsome billionaire who sweeps her off her feet , then chains her to the wall			1
but though she 's staying tight - lipped about the film , @entity17 was open and honest when asked how she handles criticism			1
the @entity143 has a pretty zen approach to those who badmouth her writing : " somebody likes it , " she said with a shrug			0
as for those who do n't ? she tries not to sweat them — " it 's just noise , " @entity17 explained			1
she advises those who want to replicate her success to embrace that same outlook : " write for yourself , " she told aspiring authors			0
" before saying goodbye , @entity16 genially asked @entity17 if the interview had been painful — innuendo intended — and @entity17 joked that it had n't been " painful in the right way			2
" and thus ended the kinkiest episode of daytime television since the golden age of @entity168			0
though she put on a brave face , it seems like taking off her handcuff - inspired bracelet and watching the lights shift from naughty red to regular white might have been a relief for @entity16 — during a post-show q&a , the tv vet admitted that she would n't let her 16 and 21 - year - old daughters read @entity17 ' bestsellers			2
" but i 'm a prude , as you guys can tell , " she quipped before leaving the stage for good			0
