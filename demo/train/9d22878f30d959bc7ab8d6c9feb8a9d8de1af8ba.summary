@entity0 , @entity1 -- the backup legal team for admitted @entity0 gunman maj. @entity4 asked to withdraw from active participation in the case wednesday , telling a judge that @entity4 wants to be sentenced to death			1

" but he refused to submit his objection in writing , a move that @entity14 requested to avoid revealing privileged information , and insisted on being heard in open court			0
@entity56 , a military justice expert at the @entity57 in @entity58 , said the lawyers are in " a terrible predicament			2
" " they have to stand by and watch the person they are ostensibly charged with assisting to represent himself essentially put a noose around his own neck , and they view this as fundamentally inconsistent with their ethical obligation as lawyers , " he said			0
but @entity56 said @entity4 not only has the right to defend himself , " he has the right to do it poorly " -- even to the point of asking for death			1

in that time , he discharges his weapon			0
