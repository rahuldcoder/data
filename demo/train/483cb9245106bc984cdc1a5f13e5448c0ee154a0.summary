-- an @entity2 missionary family living in @entity3 has been providing virtually nonstop reports about the devastation from tuesday 's earthquake and tracking down information on others serving there			1
" there is no way to even begin to share the things we 've heard and seen since 5 p.m. yesterday , " @entity10 wrote on the family 's blog wednesday morning			1
" to do so would take hours that we do n't have to give right now			1
some of them feel wrong to tell			1
like only @entity20 should know these personal horrible tragedies			1
" @entity10 and @entity22 are country directors for @entity24 , a @entity25 - based charitable organization providing @entity27 education , health care , nutrition and micro-enterprise opportunities to children and families in @entity3			1
" sometimes life in @entity3 leaves you wondering ' where are you @entity20 ? ' and other times we witness miracles with our own eyes , " they write in their blog profile			1
besides @entity42 and @entity10 , the household in @entity44 is made up of daughter @entity45 , 15 , and " the crew " : @entity47 , 8 , @entity48 , 7 , @entity49 , 5 , @entity50 , 3 , @entity51 , 2 , @entity52 , also 2 , and peanut the dog			1
some of the children are adopted			1
@entity55 , 19 , lives in @entity56 with her husband , @entity57			1
in addition , there 's @entity60 , the children 's nanny			1
( " she is the mvp around here			1
we love her and think of her as family , " the blog says			1
) finally , there 's @entity68 , @entity42 's assistant , security chief and all - around handyman , who lives at the @entity71			1
the @entity72 see themselves and their efforts as " a work in progress -- trying to make the love of @entity77 known while learning to know him better ourselves			1
" that work since tuesday evening has been consumed by gathering and reporting information about the quake and accounting for missing missionaries and other people			1
@entity22 's reports came in the form of tweets that alternated between raw descriptions and expressions of hope : " ... covered in dust and debris ... we saw a few bodies that had been pulled out of the rubble laying dead in the sidewalk ... many others injured " " @entity98 groups are singing throughout the city all through the night in prayer			1
it is a beautiful sound in the middle of a horrible tragedy			1
" " the worst damage is in @entity105 ( @entity106 , near the @entity107 ) we are hearing that many two and three story buildings did not make it			2
" " @entity68 made it home from @entity111 - saw many dead bodies and injured along the way - said most buildings w / more than one story are down			2
" " the @entity3 people are out praying together -- aftershock happening right now			2
" share your images and accounts on the blog , @entity10 's writing is both pained and eloquent : " the few things we can confirm -- yes the four story @entity124 building is completely demolished , " she posted			1
" yes it was open			2
yes gov't buildings nearby the @entity107 collapsed			2
yes @entity131 home is completely collapsed			2
yes countless countless - countless other houses , churches , hospitals , schools , and businesses have collapsed			2
there are buildings that suffered almost no damage			2
right next door will be a pile of rubble			2
" thousands of people are currently trapped			2
to guess at a number would be like guessing at raindrops in the ocean			0
precious lives hang in the balance			0
when pulled from the rubble there is no place to take them for care @entity3 has an almost non existent medical care system for her people			0
" i can not imagine what the next few weeks and months will be like			0
i am afraid for everyone			0
never in my life have i seen people stronger than @entity3 people			0
but i am afraid for them			0
" when the quake hit it took many seconds to even process what was happening			0
the house was rocking back and forth in a way that i can not even begin to describe			0
it felt like a movie			0
things were crashing all over the house			0
it felt like the world was ending			0
i do not know why my house stands and my children all lie sleeping in their beds right now			1
it defies logic and my babies were spared while thousands of others were not			0
" there are friends and co-workers that are missing			0
people whom no - one can account for			0
people we work with and love			0
there are more than i can name , but in particular we wait on one single friend who lived near the @entity195 -- which has reportedly collapsed			0
" she concludes the post with an appeal : " the horror has only just begun and i beg you to get on your knees -- i truly mean on your knees and pray for the people of this country			0
the news might forget in a few days - but people will still be trapped alive and suffering			0
after that - please pray			0
