-- next time you go to the grocery store to pick up steaks or some hamburger , you 'll know where the cow it came from was born , raised and slaughtered , thanks to new labeling rules that became final saturday			1
the @entity12 , or @entity12 , rule went into effect in may , though companies were given six months use up older labels " to clear the chain of commerce , thus preventing retailer and supplier confusion and alleviating some of the economic burden on regulated entities , " the @entity10 @entity9 explains			1
but as of saturday , that leeway period was over			0
here 's how it works : if everything happened domestically , the label would say , " born , raised and slaughtered in the @entity10			1
" a product that crisscrosses multiple countries would have wording like , " born in @entity29 , raised and slaughtered in the @entity10			1
" if it is entirely imported , the label would state -- as it would have previously -- " product of " whatever country it came from			2
this new labeling system aims to bring the @entity10 in compliance with @entity36 guidelines			1
in addition to " muscle cuts of beef " ( including veal ) , the @entity12 law applies to similar cuts of lamb , pork , goat and chicken ; wild fish and certain nuts and other food products			0
ground meats have to have such labels , too , " listing all countries ... that may be reasonably contained therein , " the @entity9 explains			2
" ' reasonable ' means when any raw material from a specific origin is not in a processors inventory for more than 60 days , that country should not be included			2
" the @entity9 said the " program is neither a food safety or traceability program but rather a consumer information program			0
" the new regulations have riled some in the meat industry			1
@entity66 , for instance , said they are others " are very disappointed by the changes			0
" " these new rules significantly increase costs because they require additional product codes , production breaks and product segregation , including a separate category for cattle shipped directly from @entity71 to @entity10 beef plants , without providing any incremental value to our customers , " @entity66 said in a statement announcing it was suspending cattle shipped from @entity71 to its beef plants			1
the @entity85 likewise has spoken out in opposition , with its president calling the action " short - sighted " and fearing it would spur " increased discrimination against imported products " in light of anger internationally about the move			0
" while trying to make an untenable mandate fit with our international trade obligations , @entity9 chose to set up @entity10 cattle producers for financial losses , " said association president @entity95 , a dairy and cattle producer from @entity98 , @entity99			1
others , though , have applauded the move -- and fought efforts against it			0
some are in the industry			2
dr. @entity111 , the head of the @entity113 , said that " the meat business needs more transparency , not less			2
" and @entity116 , an official with @entity117 , argued that the change makes sense because it serves consumers ' best interests , whether or not it affects some companies ' bottom lines			0
" consumers deserve to know where their food comes from , " he said			0
" and factory farming organizations that seek to have it otherwise are out of step with their customers			0

new labels must be on meat sold in the @entity10
they may show meat was born in one country , slaughtered in another
some in the meat industry are *strongly* opposed to the new guidelines
but others say they better serve consumers
