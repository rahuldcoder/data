-- a paramedic who responded to a horrific , deadly fertilizer plant explosion in @entity3 , @entity4 -- and who later spoke at a memorial for its victims -- pleaded guilty thursday after accusations he possessed materials to make a pipe bomb			1
@entity11 pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess a destructive device and attempted obstruction of justice , according to his lawyer @entity16			1
in august , @entity18 criminal district attorney @entity17 said he had n't seen " credible evidence " linking @entity11 's possession of a prohibited weapon to the april 17 blast at a @entity11 facility			1
a fire led to the ammonium nitrate explosion , which killed 15 people -- most of them firefighters and paramedics -- and devastated @entity3 , a small town about 20 miles north of @entity30 and 75 miles south of @entity31			1
dozens of homes , two schools and a nursing home suffered significant damage in the blast , which was so big that seismographs registered it as a small earthquake			0
@entity11 was among the emergency workers who responded to the site			0
he was vocal afterward as well , speaking to reporters and at a memorial service at @entity44 for the blast 's victims			0
" there 's no way i would have ever dreamed that this would have happened , " @entity11 told @entity0 's " @entity49			0
" " i mean , it 's profound and it 's dire , and it hurts like hell			0
" yet @entity11 himself became a target of authorities after components of a pipe bomb were found at a residence , according to a criminal complaint affidavit			1
the officers determined that @entity11 had given the materials -- including galvanized metal pipe , a fuse , coils of metal ribbon and several bags of chemical powders -- to that home 's resident			2
in a statement , @entity11 's lawyers stressed that neither the charge nor the plea agreement " have anything to do with the tragic explosion			2
" he chose to plead guilty , they said , " to accept full responsibility for what he believes is his role in the allegations against him " and avoid a drawn - out trial			0
" finally , ... mr. @entity11 believes that continuing to draw out this process will be a distraction to the most important issue , the losses suffered by the heroes , friends and loved ones in the @entity3 community , " his lawyers said .			2

lawyer : @entity11 pleads guilty to conspiracy to possess a destructive device
an affidavit says he gave someone components for a pipe bomb
@entity11 was among the first responders at a @entity3 , @entity4 , plant explosion that left 15 dead
he *insists* the charges are n't related to the blast ; authorities have n't connected them
