umpires @entity11 and @entity12 inspect the suspect @entity4 outfield amid farcical scenes			1
amid scenes of complete chaos , the heavily - sanded outfield played havoc with the bowlers ' run - ups and -- either side of a brief break for a shower -- the umpires and match referee had no alternative but to call off play for the day			1
in the short period of play possible , both @entity2 opening bowlers @entity30 and @entity32 struggled to run to the crease			1
match referee @entity34 was called into the middle by umpires @entity11 and @entity12 and quickly made his decision			2
" the bowlers are having problems with their footings , " he told @entity38			2
" they were having trouble getting any traction at all			0
the umpires have agreed with that			0
it is a health hazard for the players			0
play has been abandoned for the day as the ground is unfit			2
" much of the pre-match discussions had centered on the state of the ground at the sir @entity51 , with @entity34 admitting that no - one had tested the run ups			1
" no - one had bowled on the wicket to test it out , " he admitted			1
" it would have been jumping the gun to say it was unfit before the start of play			0
in the long run we have to look at the health and safety of the players			0
" after much deliberating , officials concluded that the pitch would not be ready in time to resume proceedings on saturday and made the decision to switch the match to the @entity74 -- leaving groundstaff a race against the clock to prepare the island 's traditional international venue , which has not been used for @entity79 since 2006			1
@entity3 were seven without loss when match officials abandoned play and the tourists will now have to start from scratch at the @entity74 , where they had been training prior to friday 's debacle			2
the opening hour of the contest was reminiscent of the shambles of the 1998 @entity90 test which was scrapped after just 10.1 overs due to an unsatisfactory pitch			0
dr @entity93 , chairman of the @entity94 , said : " let me apologize to everyone on behalf of the board for what is quite rightly called an ' embarrassment '			0
the ultimate responsibility lies with the board and we are not shirking it			0
" @entity3 are currently 1 - 0 down in the test series after falling to an embarrassing innings and 23 run defeat at @entity90 in the first test last week .			1
