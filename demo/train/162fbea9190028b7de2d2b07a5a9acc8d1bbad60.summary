threatening your guests rarely yields smiley happy reviews			2
it 's a lesson @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , learned monday after the @entity7 highlighted the hotel 's attempt to fine wedding parties $ 500 for any negative online reviews posted by any members of their parties			1
hundreds of people took to @entity16 on monday to complain about the policy and write mostly fake , eviscerating reviews of the property			1
at one point monday there were more than 700 reviews on @entity16 , but the company had deleted many reviews by monday afternoon because they did n't reflect " first - hand experiences , " according to @entity16			1
" trying to prevent your customers from talking about their experiences is bad policy and , in this case , likely unenforceable anyway , " @entity16 said			1
screen shots of the policy , which had been removed from the hotel website as of monday afternoon , read " there will be a $ 500 fine that will be deducted from your deposit for every negative review of @entity4 placed on any internet site by anyone in your party and / or attending your wedding or event			1
" apparently guests who do n't like their stays at the guest house just do n't understand the historic buildings or region , according to the hotel website			2
" please know that despite the fact that wedding couples love @entity5 and our inn , your friends and families may not , " the website says			1
" this is due to the fact that your guests may not understand what we offer -- therefore we expect you to explain that to them			0
@entity4 & @entity5 are historic			2
the buildings here are old ( but restored )			0
" our bathrooms and kitchens are designed to look old in an artistic ' vintage ' way			0
our furniture is mostly hip , period furniture that you would see in many design magazines			0
( although comfortable and functional -- obviously all beds are brand new			0
) if your guests are looking for a @entity75 type hotel they may not like it here			0
" @entity77 called the inn repeatedly but only reached a busy signal , and an e-mailed request for comment was not returned			2
the inn posted an explanation on its @entity85 page , which was later removed			1
" the policy regarding wedding fines was put on our site as a tongue - in - cheek response to a wedding many years ago			1
it was meant to be taken down long ago and certainly was never enforced , " the post said			2
but one @entity16 reviewer posted complaints about the policy last year after he posted a negative @entity16 review			1
" the management of this hotel had the gall to email us twice to threaten us financially about the negative review ! " wrote one reviewer , whose @entity16 handle is @entity99 he continues : " here is an excerpt from their first email : ' please note that your recent on - line review of our inn will cost the wedding party that left us a deposit $ 500			1
this money be charged via the deposit they have left us unless / until it is removed			0
any other or future reviews will also be charged to the wedding party ( bride & groom ) from the guarantee they have provided us			0
' " other parts of the hotel 's website are a little cranky , too			2
one example : " we reserve the right to cancel a reservation at any time for any reason			0
" another policy about cancellations : " if your stay is longer than 3 days we do not accept cancellations of any kind			0
" positive online reviews equal more hotel revenue , said @entity141 , director of @entity142 , an online hospitality reputation management company			1
" the answer is not to fine guests but to use feedback to make changes in your operations , " he told @entity77			0
" that leads to guests having happier experiences and sharing these reviews on these review sites			0

a @entity5 , @entity6 , inn had a policy on its website imposing a fine for bad online reviews
internet users responded with a *vengeance* , posting negative comments and reviews on @entity16
*language* about the $ 500 *penalty* for bad reviews was removed from the inn 's site
@entity172 was " tongue - in - cheek , " according to a @entity85 post that was later removed
