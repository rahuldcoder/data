-- now the party is really starting			1
democrats and @entity3 are preparing to gather to hold their conventions , each using this precious time to tell the nation what its presidential candidate is all about			2
@entity3 are hoping that gov. @entity10 can tear down the @entity2 , @entity12 style , in his keynote address , and that @entity14 can add some foreign policy heft to a ticket remarkably thin on international affairs			0
@entity2 are depending on former president @entity18 to tap into the rhetoric he used against @entity3 in the budget battles of 1995 to cut into @entity21 and @entity23 's vision for @entity24			1
they hope that @entity26 mayor @entity25 , the keynote speaker , can send a message to @entity28 about which party is on their side			2
without any more deal - making in smoke - filled rooms , speeches are the highlight of the convention			1
even when speeches are made at conventions whose candidate winds up losing , they can offer ideas and rhetoric that become integral to the party for decades to come			1
a look back at history reveals that there are different types of speeches that we might see in the coming weeks , each with very different purposes and effect			2
ideological agenda - setters : there are some speeches that are notable because they lay out a set of principles for the party to embrace in the coming election and thereafter			1
as opposed to focusing on the particularities of a specific campaign , these speeches put forth ideas that shape the next generation of candidates			1
in 1948 , the @entity68 candidate for senator , @entity69 , delivered a thunderous address in which he called on @entity2 to embrace the cause of civil rights or leave the party			2
" to those who say that this civil rights program is an infringement of states ' rights , " @entity69 said , " i say this : the time has arrived for the @entity79 to get out of the shadow of states ' rights and walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights			0
" the speech put the party on the side of racial liberalism and accelerated the path toward the @entity89			1
the same year that @entity90 passed the civil rights legislation , @entity93 sen. @entity92 gave his most famous address , when he told @entity3 to embrace conservatism and avoid the lure of centrism			0
he ardently defended a right - wing agenda			0
even though @entity92 lost the presidential election , the speech signaled the future of the party			2
in 1980 , sen. @entity103 , who lost the nomination to president @entity105 , energized delegates by talking about the party 's traditions and defense of the common man			1
" our commitment has been , since the days of @entity112 , to all those he called ' the humble members of society -- the farmers , mechanics , and laborers			0
' on this foundation we have defined our values , refined our policies , and refreshed our faith			0
" he warned against the creeping conservatism of the @entity105 administration and reminded the @entity2 to stay true to their core values			0
his rhetoric continues to offer inspiration for @entity2 to this day			0
opposition attacks : other speeches are effective primarily because they eviscerate the opposition , defining candidates , and defining parties , in ways that stick			1
when @entity136 accepted the @entity79 nomination in 1932 , he introduced @entity138 to his vision of a @entity140 -- a program of government assistance that would include help to farmers , workers and small business owners			0
@entity136 pushed back against the economic orthodoxies of the time , telling delegates , " our @entity3 leaders tell us economic laws -- sacred , inviolable , unchangeable -- cause panics which no one could prevent			0
but while they prate of economic laws , men and women are starving			0
" in 1984 , @entity159 gov. @entity158 offered a powerful challenge to president @entity162 's argument that it was " morning in @entity138 " again , and that the country was a " shining city on a hill			2
" @entity158 distinguished between an economic recovery that benefited the wealthy and one that affected all @entity138			0
" there is despair , mr. president , " @entity158 said , " in the facts that you do n't see , in the places that you do n't visit in your shining city			0
" @entity158 's speech became a powerful narrative for talking about the impact of @entity3 economic policies			2
that same year , @entity179 , @entity138 ambassador to the @entity180 , ripped into the foreign policy of " @entity182 @entity2 , " castigating her former party , charging , " they always blame @entity138 first			2
" inspirational : sometimes speeches are able to inspire delegates			1
in 1960 , @entity187 said that " we stand today on the edge of a @entity190 -- the frontier of the 1960s , the frontier of unknown opportunities and perils , the frontier of unfilled hopes and unfilled threats			0
... beyond that frontier are uncharted areas of science and space , unsolved problems of peace and war , unconquered problems of ignorance and prejudice , unanswered questions of poverty and surplus			0
" for many @entity138 , this speech was the moment they fell in love with the charismatic senator and started to believe that he could help the country to do great things @entity217 is born : convention speeches can put politicians on the map			1
in 1976 , @entity162 won the hearts of @entity3 , even if he did n't win enough of their votes to become the party 's presidential nominee that year			1
in unplanned remarks , he spoke to them about the need to stand firm against communism so that the country would protect the world from nuclear destruction			0
at the @entity79 convention in 1976 , @entity234 rep. @entity233 of @entity235 introduced herself and a new generation of @entity234 politicians			1
in 2004 , sen. @entity240 's powerful oratory at the @entity242 convention , about the need to unify the nation , propelled him onto the national stage			1
@entity246 : like the rest of the campaign , a convention speech can help bring broad coalitions together , outlining points of commonality amid significant difference			2
in 1980 , @entity162 displayed his formidable skills with an acceptance speech that reached out to the conservative base , fiscal conservatives , neoconservative hawks , and centrist voters all in one swoop			0
the flop : sometimes speeches are so bad they are good			1
when candidates deliver really poor speeches , they can attract considerable attention and , occasionally , they do n't end up sidetracking their careers			1
in 1988 , the rising star @entity269 gov. @entity18 delivered a long - winded speech that ended with delegates cheering when he finally said " in conclusion			0
" although he would later improve his style , going on to win the presidency , the failure of the speech actually gave him even more of the national spotlight			0
these are some of the kinds of speeches that we might see in the coming weeks			2
each has a very different value and , other than the flop , each can be helpful in energizing the party for the battle that is ahead			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity291 .			1

speeches are the highlight of each party 's political convention , says @entity291
some speeches put forth ideas that shape the next generation of candidates , he says
others eviscerate the opposition , *permanently* defining candidates and parties , he says
@entity291 : some speeches inspire , others make instant stars , and others flop *resoundingly*
