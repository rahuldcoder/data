-- @entity1 is the founding director of the @entity2 and @entity3 at @entity4			1
he is the author of @entity5 : the @entity6			0
@entity7 does not promote happiness			1
most creatures live on the edge of survival and do whatever it takes to get through another day			0
yet , many human beings seek to be , and often are , happy			1
how did that happen ? i spent a decade running neuroscience experiments to understand why humans are , much of the time , moral			1
we expect others to be honest , trustworthy , and kind and are outraged when they are not			0
as i report in my recent book @entity5 : the source of @entity23 and @entity24 , my experiments showed that a then largely - ignored brain chemical in humans , oxytocin , motivates moral behaviors			1
oxytocin does this by producing the feeling of empathy : when we are emotionally connected to others we tend to treat them well			1
my studies showed this was true even between complete strangers			0
over 2,000 years ago , @entity37 claimed that morality comes from being in community with others			1
@entity37 also argued that practicing virtue made one happy			1
i decided to put this to the test			0
i found that individuals who release the most oxytocin -- i call them " oxytocin - adepts " -- were more satisfied with their lives compared to those who release less oxytocin			2
why ? they had better relationships of all types : @entity56 , friendships , family , and they even shared more money with strangers in laboratory experiments			0
the moral molecule morphed in the happy molecule			1
happiness largely comes from other people for social creatures like us			2
the logic step was to see if i could hack the happiness molecule			1
there is evidence in animals that repeated release of oxytocin biases the brain to release it more easily			1
in other words , it might be possible to become and oxytocin - adept			2
i began by refusing to shake hands			0
my experiments had shown that touch causes the release of oxytocin , so i replaced the handshake with a hug			2
yes , for everyone , even on a first meeting			0
i found that after an embrace people opened up and connected to me much better than before i started this practice			0
my second hack was spending an extra second looking at people 's faces and then telling them what i saw			1
" @entity98 , you look sad today , are you ok ? " or , " @entity99 , you really look happy , tell me what you 've been doing ? " people appreciated my focus on how they felt and conversations went from the superficial to what really mattered			2
my third hack was the most difficult			2
oxytocin is sometimes called the " love chemical " because it sustains bonds between romantic partners and between parents and children			1
i decided to tell my friends and colleagues that i loved them			0
everyone lit up , some cried , everyone returned the love in words and deeds			0
i even earned the nickname " dr. love			0
" did i really hack the happiness molecule ? i certainly feel much more connected to those around me , more open to emotional experiences , and , well , happier			1
i recently turned 50 and i was amazed when i had four surprise birthday parties on the same day			0
i think my brain hacks have made me a better friend , father , and colleague			1
@entity133 social networks extend life and improve health , so you might want to try to hack your oxytocin , too			1
here 's your to - do list : give eight hugs a day , focus on how those around you feel , and yes , use the " l " word when you can			2
if you find these difficult , start using them on a dog			0
my experiments have shown dogs are better oxytocin stimulators than other pets , and better stress - reducers , too			2
one more suggestion : last year i decided to end every conversation with the word " service , " as in , " i am at your service			0
" if i 'm in a meeting , the person i 'm with wants something from me			0
my new hack is to give others what they want generously whenever possible			2
nearly everyone is surprised and pleased by this and i typically get back much more than i have offered			0
i 'm an introvert who learned to revel in community			0
if you can hack the happiness molecule like i have , then i 've been of service			1
and that makes me happy			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity1 .			1

@entity1 : i spent a decade trying understand why humans are usually moral
his new book reports how brain chemical oxytocin motivates moral behaviors
he also tests @entity37 's theory that practicing virtue made one happy
the logical step was to see if i could hack the happiness molecule , he writes
