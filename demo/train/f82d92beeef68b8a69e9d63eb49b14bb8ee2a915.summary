-- grapple fans should head to @entity2 each year on july 11			1
it 's the day the country celebrates its independence , but also the beginning of something equally important : country - wide competitions to discover @entity2 's top wrestler			1
the wrestle-fest is part of " naadam " , the annual celebration of traditional @entity2 sports -- wrestling , archery and horse - racing -- that captivates villages , towns and cities across the country for three days			1
the grand wrestling competition held in the capital @entity23 is only open to those with a national ranking			1
but at a local level men , women and children , some as young as four years old , take part in the events			2
sporting traditional garb , the reason for the wrestlers ' frontless shirts comes from a folktale			0
it tells of a woman who was disguised as a man and won the wrestling event			0
to avoid any deception again , wrestlers from then on had to compete bare - chested			0
while there is plenty of machismo on show , and despite the fact that the festival is often referred to as the " three manly games , " women can compete in the archery competition and girls can ride as jockeys in the horse racing			1
" everyone loves horse racing in @entity2 ; it 's our national sport , " says @entity55 , who works as a guide for adventure tourists in @entity2			1
the annual event has become one of the biggest attractions for tourists visiting the country			1
@entity55 believes that despite the influx of visitors the games are still as authentic as they have ever been because of their importance to local communities			0
" for the main games of wrestling , archery and horse racing , it 's still very traditional , " she says			1
" for the naadam opening ceremony in @entity23 , because more tourists come just for that , it 's a bit touristy as there are different shows held just for them			0
" local and regional competitions are held across the country , with anyone able to compete in the events			2
competitors and competition organizers usually spend around two months training and practicing before the events begin			2
like most celebrations anywhere , food is just as important for the festivities , with deep - fried meat dumplings -- " khuushuur " -- the most popular dish			0
" naadam with no khuushuur is not a complete naadam , " says @entity55			0
as a celebration of @entity2 's nomadic past , the games will undoubtedly persist , believes @entity55			1
but she worries that the fast pace of change in the country with the current boom in mining could diminish the type of life the games commemorate			2
" visitors to the countryside and naadam will find it 's still very authentic , " she says			0
" the city is different			0
@entity117 life is very authentic but i 'm sure its going to change in a few years			0
