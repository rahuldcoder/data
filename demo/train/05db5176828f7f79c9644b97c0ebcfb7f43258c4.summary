-- i was happy to return to @entity2 , this beautiful city which i have visited several times			1
twenty years after the first @entity5 , i came to @entity2 , like many people from all over the world , to put the world on a different pathway -- one leading to sustainable development			1
but , the leaders gathered here came without an intergenerational vision and they failed to rise to the challenge ; they did not break their ties with the old ways of doing things -- ways that are proved to be unsustainable and inequitable			1

unfortunately these voices were not incorporated into the declaration text and many leave for home frustrated and angry			0
i urge those who are disappointed by the lack of urgency and commitment to channel their frustration positively to work on a parallel pathway to fill the gaps left by the @entity2 text and to deliver the futures we all need			1
more : @entity2 +20 summit must not ignore rapid population growth i had the pleasure of participating in numerous events during the conference where we discussed the role of women 's empowerment in sustainable development , the importance of making real progress on food and nutrition security and the need to improve access to sustainable energy for the poorest			1
underlying all of these discussions was the importance of upholding human rights and not backsliding on any existing commitments , while striving for a more equitable world			1
the @entity2 declaration does set some important processes in train , like developing @entity83 , which address all three dimensions of sustainable development : environmental , social and economic			1
these should be action oriented , aspirational and measurable , so that they complement the @entity88			0
likewise , processes have been established to strengthen environmental governance at the international level and to make progress on financing for sustainable development			1

however , it worries me that negotiations revealed a desire by some to step back from established commitments and principles			0
the restating of these commitments is therefore considered a success , only because these principles and values were under threat			0
more seriously , the backsliding on reproductive rights -- first established in 1994 at the @entity114 and reiterated at the @entity115 -- is simply not acceptable , as highlighted by numerous women leaders in their statements to the @entity5			1
more : the elephant in the room at @entity5 arising from the failure of political leadership here in @entity2 , our hope is that people everywhere will accept that we all have to take responsibility and mobilize ourselves			2
helped by social media and easier communication across the globe , we can make sure that the world we pass on to our children and grandchildren is safe , equitable , prosperous and sustainable			2
i was encouraged as i listened to many heads of state at the summit , who stressed their desire for a more concrete outcome			0
but this desire came too late : they should have engaged earlier in the process , they could have seized the moment and given stronger leadership			0
this possibility of a once in a generation moment passed us by and we will regret it			2
happily the lack of political leadership was countered by the incredible vitality , determination and commitment of civil society -- from young people , women , trade unions , grassroots communities , faith - based organizations and the private sector			0
the legacy of @entity2 will not just be the text of the @entity163 hopefully it will be the mobilization of people to build the future they desire			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity170 .			0
