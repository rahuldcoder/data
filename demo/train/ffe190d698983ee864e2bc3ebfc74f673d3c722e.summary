-- a @entity2 newspaper is reviewing its policy against printing same - sex wedding announcements in response to a social media campaign that has drawn international scrutiny			1
it took less than 12 hours for the @entity9 to address the controversy monday after the paper 's " celebrations editor " e-mailed @entity11 , saying the paper would not publish her wedding announcement			1
@entity16 also promised to refund the $ 25 publication fee			0
@entity11 , 31 , channeled her disappointment into social media , drawing support from as far as @entity21 and @entity22 and sparking a petition on @entity24			1
by monday night , the @entity9 editor had posted a statement on the paper 's @entity28 page saying it was " reviewing its policy about publishing same - sex announcements			1
" " this is the second such request in recent months			0
we will communicate a decision once it 's made , " forum editor @entity33 said			2
on tuesday , @entity11 and her fiancee , 27 - year - old @entity37 , met with the paper 's editor and publisher and said they left feeling hopeful			2
@entity11 and @entity42 met in @entity43 six years ago and became a couple in 2008			0
the proposed wedding announcement described their plan to marry in @entity48 on august 1 , followed by a reception on august 4 in @entity50 , where @entity42 was born and raised			2
after receiving the rejection e-mail , @entity11 took a screen shot of it and shared it with friend and @entity55 , who posted it on @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity28			1
the image was shared more than 600 times and " spread like wildfire , " @entity55 said			0
@entity11 followed up with an open letter to the @entity9 and the mayor of @entity50 and shared it on @entity28			1
" it is a sad day when two people so in love , about to commit their lives to one another , can not even engage in the smallest of privileges to honor this union , " she wrote			0
" i ask each of you reading this to explain to me why , in a city that we call home , where we are days away from becoming homeowners in @entity50 , where we support every person that does good for their community , are we excluded from being able to announce our wedding celebration ? what makes two women or two men any different from other taxpaying married citizens of @entity50 , @entity2 ? " regardless of the outcome , they said they knew the paper 's policy does n't reflect @entity50 's welcoming attitude toward the lgbt community			0
besides , they said , the ensuing support has outweighed all the initial negativity			1
" this is 10 times better than a little announcement in the local paper , " said @entity42			0
" i 'm still proud to call @entity50 my home			0
