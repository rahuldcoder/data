@entity0 has revealed he will move to the @entity2 when he leaves @entity3 at the end of the current @entity6 season			1
the @entity8 legend surprised fans and teammates with the announcement late on @entity12 that he would leave the club he supported as a boy and has represented on the pitch for the past 17 years when his contract expires in june			1
rumors quickly surfaced linking the @entity3 captain with a move to @entity20 , formerly home of ex @entity23 star @entity22			1
speaking to @entity3 's in - house tv channel saturday , the player himself confirmed that the @entity2 would be his next destination			1
@entity0 did n't confirm the club he will be signing for but reports late on saturday suggested that an 18 - month deal was close to being agreed with the @entity20			1
" i can tell the supporters at the moment that it will be @entity2 , " said the 34 - year - old			1
" but i 'm not over the line with any team just yet			0
i 'm close and as soon as i know , i 'll make the announcement , i 'll do the bits and bobs that i need to do			0
" then we try to go and win a trophy and forget about @entity0 for a bit			2
" commenting on the difficulty of coming to his decision , @entity0 said he realized it was time to move on when @entity3 manager @entity46 began to discuss how best to make the most of his abilities in the veteran stage of his career and the possibility that he may no longer be an automatic choice			1
" there was more than one moment that has made me come to this decision , but i think the key conversation or moment was with the manager when he sat me down not so long ago and said it was time to manage my games for me and for the team , " @entity0 said			1
" i 'm bright enough to realize it is the right thing for everyone , but when you 've been a starter and a mainstay in the team for such a long time , it was a very difficult conversation to have with the manager			0
" i accept it and i 'll continue to give everything i 've got , whether i 'm starting , coming off the bench or whatever , but that was the key conversation that swung me to deciding to come away for a short while			0
" i had an idea it was going to come at some time - i 'm a human , not a robot			0
i wish i was 24 , i wish i 'd met @entity46 when i was 24 because i think i 'd be sitting here talking about a lot of titles that we 'd won together			2
" @entity0 made his first - team debut for @entity3 in november 1998 and has scored 180 goals to date in all competitions			1
he also represented @entity23 114 times -- before retiring after the @entity84 -- and has won eight trophies with @entity3 including two @entity86 , three @entity87 and the @entity88 in 2001			2
his greatest achievement came in 2005 when he captained @entity3 to victory in the @entity92 final against @entity93 in @entity94			2
however , his long - cherished desire to win the @entity6 never materialized -- @entity3 came close in 2009 finishing second to @entity96 and last season @entity46 ' side were pipped to the post by @entity100			1
even more distressingly @entity0 's mistake in the 2 - 0 home defeat by @entity103 near the end of the season gifted the visitors their first goal -- an error opposition supporters continue to remind the @entity3 captain about in a song during games			1
despite the teasing from opposition fans and occasional negative reviews of his performances this season from once - admiring pundits , @entity0 said he was taken aback by the support he has received in recent days			2
given his long history with the club and the emotional nature of his decision , its a backing he said he feels fortunate to have			0
" i 've been here a long time			0
i 've been coming to this training ground since i was eight years of age , " he said			0
" i always knew it was going to end one day and it would be an emotional decision			0
people will have their own opinions on it but for me , come the summer it will be the right time			0
" the messages of support i 've had from the fans , the players , the staff , the media and people who i 've worked with for a long time has blew me away , " @entity0 continued			1
" that 's when i 've started getting emotional			0
but i need to be string and hold them back because i 'm not going yet			0
" " there are still six months to go and i 've still got plenty to try to achieve , so i am trying to keep my focus on that			0
@entity3 currently lie in eighth position in the @entity6 , six points behind fourth placed @entity149 , and are still in contention for a @entity92 place			2
the club are also still competing in the @entity88 and @entity153			0
@entity0 scored twice from the penalty spot on @entity12 as @entity3 drew 2 - 2 with @entity155 and is in contention to play when his side face @entity157 in the @entity153 on monday .			1
