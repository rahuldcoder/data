@entity3 -- " electronic cigarettes " that vaporize nicotine juice to inhale instead of smoke from burning tobacco do not deliver as promised , according to research at @entity1			1
" they are as effective at nicotine delivery as puffing on an unlit cigarette , " said dr. @entity8 , at the school 's @entity9			1
his study , funded by the federal @entity15 , is the first by @entity18 doctors to check the function of so - called " no - smoke tobacco " devices , which are unregulated in the @entity18 for sale or use			1
the units are shaped like a cigarette and contain a battery that heats a filament to vaporize liquid nicotine in a refillable cartridge			1
smokers buy the devices to get around no - smoking restrictions and to attempt to quit conventional cigarettes			1
some users nickname what they 're doing as " vaping " instead of smoking , to reflect the vapor produced by the heating element			0
the devices are marketed as an alternative to smoking , but retailers avoid making claims about health or safety			1
fans have established a web site , www.e-cigarette-forum.com			0
founder @entity50 said the site " is the largest e-smokers community online with some 26,000 members , most of whom are in the @entity18 " @entity57 , a former tobacco smoker in @entity59 , @entity60 , who sells electronic cigarettes , is convinced there are immediate health advantages in avoiding the known cancer - causing substances in the smoke of a burning cigarette			1
" i smoked 37 years , and when i found them , i was , like , ' thank , you @entity77 , ' " @entity57 said with a laugh , as a reporter visited his shop , @entity72 , coincidentally just a few blocks from where the research was conducted at @entity1			2
in march , the @entity79 imposed a ban on continued imports of the devices , pending regulatory review for any health risks			1
the latest clinical evidence suggests users are not getting the addictive substance they get from smoking tobacco			2
" these e-cigs do not deliver nicotine , " @entity8 said of the findings he expects to publish in an upcoming issue @entity91 , a product of the @entity93			0
this past summer , @entity8 recruited smokers without prior experience using e-cigarettes to volunteer to use two popular brands of the devices for a set period			0
the 16 subjects were regularly measured in a clinical setting for the presence of nicotine in their bodies , their reported craving for conventional cigarettes , and certain physiological effects such as a change in heart rate			0
" ten puffs from either of these electronic cigarettes with a 16 mg nicotine cartridge delivered little to no nicotine , " the study found			0
but the units may deliver hazardous chemicals , according to preliminary checks by federal regulators			0
in a notice to importers , the @entity79 blocked continued shipments after finding diethylene glycol , a chemical used in antifreeze that is toxic to humans			2
the government 's statement noted there are no health warnings on the products , and that " the @entity79 analyses detected carcinogens , including nitrosamines			1
" the notice of the import ban says " the product appears to be a combination drug - device , " that " requires pre-approval , registration and listing with the @entity79 " in order to be marketed in the @entity18			1
a company challenging the import ban claims in federal court documents to have sold 600,000 of the devices in a year 's time through a network of 120 distributors in the @entity18			0
" we are on the verge of going out of business , which is why we are suing the @entity79 in @entity157 , " said @entity3 , attorney @entity149 , representing a company called " smoking everywhere , " a @entity18 wholesaler that was importing the devices from @entity153			1
the lawsuit questions the @entity79 's authority to block shipments of a non-tobacco product , and says the agency has violated its statutory process for product review			2
liquid nicotine is available on the open market through pharmaceutical houses and vendors who sell e-cigarettes			0
a judge january 14 ruled the @entity79 does not have such authority , but the agency has taken the matter to the @entity174 , which has yet to decide the case			2
the appeals panel issued a stay against the judge 's ruling until it can rule on the agency 's appeal			0
meanwhile , based on the judge 's ruling , lawyers for the importers have filed a request to compel the @entity79 to lift its import ban , saying the agency is not likely to win its appeal			2
the filing says " although e-cigarettes have been sold since 2007 , @entity79 has not identified a single instance , either in this court or below , of an adverse health effect from e-cigarettes			1
" president @entity195 , who has described himself as an occasional smoker , has been offered one of the devices by @entity200 rep. @entity199			0
the @entity203 lawmaker 's office said the president did not respond			0
an administration spokesman last year said the @entity205 was not aware of the offer			0
in a copy of a letter to the chief executive dated march 26 , @entity199 wrote , " i have recently given out e-cigarettes to a few members of @entity212 and they have become quite a hit			0
" sales of the devices continue at shopping mall kiosks and small storefront retailers , apparently drawing from stock imported before the @entity79 began to block shipments from overseas suppliers .			1
