@entity0 , @entity1 -- independent tests commissioned by @entity2 of water supplies from a hotel and home in southwest @entity1 showed the presence of a chemical after a leak in the area last week , but both samples were within levels believed to be acceptable for consumption			1
@entity14 , a private company , conducted the test			0
samples taken tuesday showed the presence of 4 - methylcyclohexane methanol -- a substance used in the coal industry -- well below the 1 part per million considered safe to drink			1
water in the private residence tested at 0.27 parts per million , or about a fourth of the limit , while water at the hotel tested at .011 parts per million , roughly a hundredth of the limit , according to the testing firm			1

more than half of the @entity35 who have n't been able to turn on their faucets since last week now have access to safe water again			1
water customers in about 70,000 homes and businesses covering well over half of the people originally affected may now use the water , according to @entity47			1
