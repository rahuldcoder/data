-- in an emergency , do you know how to best use your cell phone to stay safe , informed and in touch ? recognizing that @entity8 have been getting mixed messages from many sources , this week the @entity6 and the @entity7 teamed up to publish a new list of tips for communicating before , during and after a disaster			1
these tips complement the advice already offered in the @entity17 section of the government 's emergency preparedness site , @entity20			1
in an interview thursday , @entity6 chair @entity21 said that in the wake of @entity24 , @entity7 and the @entity6 realized that many @entity8 still do n't understand some important basics about how communication technology functions in emergency situations			1
for instance , many people do n't grasp the consequences of cordless phones			1
if the power goes out , you ca n't use a cordless phone to make or receive calls unless it has a battery backup			1
consequently the @entity6 / @entity7 tip sheet recommends : " if you have a traditional landline ( non-broadband or @entity41 ) phone , keep at least one non-cordless phone in your home			1
" said @entity21 , " i have a 19 - year - old son , and he was my guinea pig on this			0
i asked him if he could use a cordless phone when the power is out , and he did n't know			1
" recognizing that many of today 's cell phones can do much more than make calls , the tip sheet also recommends using non-voice channels to conserve capacity on wireless networks during emergencies			2
according to the tip sheet , " for non-emergency communications , use text messaging , e-mail , or social media instead of making voice calls on your cell phone to avoid tying up voice networks			2
data - based services like texts and e-mails are less likely to experience network congestion			0
you can also use social media to post your status to let family and friends know you are okay			0
in addition to @entity75 and @entity76 , you can use resources such as the @entity78 and well program			0
" learn more about why your emergency kit should include a cell phone disaster response overlaps with day - to - day emergency response systems , which is partly why thursday 's @entity85 meeting focused on next - generation 911 , or @entity86 , systems			1
in emergencies , @entity86 systems would allow people to contact local emergency responders by sending text or photo / video messages to 911			2
on thursday the @entity6 announced that it 's beginning to formulate rules to accelerate the development of @entity86 technologies			1
" some of these ideas used to be science fiction -- but implementing this technology is now within reach , " said @entity21 ( the @entity8 @entity101 also has an @entity86 project			0
) the new @entity6 rules also would call for carriers to increase location accuracy in cell phone call tracking , and to " enhance the information available to @entity108 and first responders for assessing and responding to emergencies			1
" the @entity6 is also starting to examine how wireless carriers might start prioritizing 911 calls			1
" surprisingly , this is not already happening , " said @entity21			0
" the way the system works now , if the phone network is so congested that nothing gets through , that holds up 911 calls , too			1
we definitely saw this after the earthquake a month ago			0
but when networks are congested , 911 calls should get priority over other call traffic			2
" social media is a growing part of the communication picture , especially in the wake of emergencies			0
" social media is ultimately part of @entity86			0
we need to make sure that emergency responders have access to social networks and wireless networks in their digital command centers , so they can see and integrate info from many sources and have it be actionable , " @entity21 said			2
@entity140 , director for public safety and homeland security for @entity143 ( a leading vendor of geographic information systems , or @entity146 ) has offered advice on how social - media users could create actionable emergency response information through the words they use in emergency - related tweets and status updates			2
@entity140 noted that currently the @entity6 / @entity7 tip sheet offers " no direction or guidance on messaging to communicate a categorical problem			1
i still believe we are missing the boat by not providing a recommended list of key topics , hash - tags , etc. that could be quickly recognized and prioritized during emergencies for the social media domain			0
" despite safety problems posed by texting while driving , or how being distracted by your cell phone might make you an easier target for street crime , @entity21 said that in the big picture , cell phones have made the world a safer place			2
" remember 911 calls in a world without mobile phones ? if you were out on the street or in your car and you saw an emergency , you could n't call 911 immediately			1
the fact that most people now have cell phones is a very significant improvement in public safety , " he said			0
" sure , we need to do more maximize this opportunity , but the fact that we have mobile networks is a big plus			0
the same is true for social networking			0
we are generally safer thanks to how people use social networks in emergencies			0

the @entity6 and @entity7 offer new tech tips for emergency preparedness
many do n't know how to use technology in emergency situations
if the power goes out , you ca n't use a cordless phone to make or receive calls
@entity6 is developing new rules to *foster* development of next - generation 911
