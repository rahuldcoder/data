it 's been five years since a 14 - year - old @entity3 girl with special needs said she was persuaded by a teacher 's aide to act as bait to catch an accused sexual predator			1
the girl 's life was changed forever , she said , when the accused predator , a fellow student , allegedly sodomized her in a school bathroom			1
" i just felt like i was set up by the teachers			1
they gave me a word that they could n't keep , " said the woman , who asked @entity1 to call her " @entity15			0
" in 2010 , @entity20 's father filed a lawsuit against @entity22 and its officials , and after years of legal battles , @entity20 , now 19 , will have her day in federal court			1
the @entity26 has agreed to hear oral arguments in the case			1
" we look forward to discussing this case with the judges who will be deciding it and ultimately letting a jury decide this matter , " said @entity29 , the attorney representing the girl and her father			1
" it has essentially devastated her life			0
" according to court records , a 16 - year - old student approached @entity20 in the hallway of @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity3 , on january 22 , 2010 , and asked her to meet him in a bathroom for sex			1
it was not the first time the boy had propositioned her , said @entity20 , who was enrolled in the school 's special education program			1
usually , she ignored him , but on that day @entity20 told a friend , who suggested she tell a teacher 's aide what was happening			1
the aide , june @entity61 , knew of other girls whom the boy had tried to lure into a bathroom for sex , according the lawsuit			2
@entity61 told the school 's principal , @entity66 , about the allegations			2
according to a 2012 deposition , @entity66 told @entity61 the boy would have to be proven guilty to be punished			0
in response , @entity61 crafted a plan to prove the allegations , using @entity20 as bait			1
the idea was to have the girl agree to meet the boy in a bathroom			2
@entity61 would watch surveillance video , and teachers would intervene before anything happened			0
" i told her no. i did n't want to do it , " @entity20 told @entity1			1
she acquiesced later that day , she said , explaining , " i just wanted it to stop			0
" key questions in her case center around who knew what , and when			0
@entity20 and @entity61 claim they went to the office of vice-principal @entity88 , and when @entity61 told @entity88 about the plan , she said , @entity88 did not respond			1
during a deposition , @entity88 denied the conversation happened			0
@entity20 then left @entity88 's office and found the boy in the hallway to tell him they could " do it , " @entity20 told @entity1			1
@entity61 stayed behind to watch surveillance monitors , hoping to catch the two walk into the bathroom			0
according to @entity20 's written statement after the incident , the boy made a last - minute change			1
instead of meeting in the boys ' bathroom on the special needs students ' corridor , the boy allegedly told the girl to meet him in the sixth - grade boys ' bathroom , in another part of the school			0
once there , @entity20 says she tried to stall the boy , hoping a teacher would rush in			1
she told him she did n't want to have sex , and she tried blocking him , according to her 2012 deposition			0
the boy sodomized her , @entity20 said			1
" i thought they were going to do what they said they were going to do -- and be there and stop him -- just get him in trouble , " @entity20 told @entity1			1
the alleged attacker was never charged , and the case was never presented to a grand jury , according to @entity132 district attorney @entity131			1
the incident was characterized as " inappropriate ( sic ) touching a girl in boys bathroom , " according to school disciplinary records			0
the boy was suspended from school for five days and sent to an alternative school for a short time			0
the alleged attack was at least the 13th incident of sexual or violent misconduct in the boy 's file , all within two academic years			1
while at the alternative school , the boy was suspended for sharing pornographic images on a cell phone			0
he was eventually allowed to return to @entity44 , where @entity20 was still enrolled			1
" he just gets away with it , i guess , " she told @entity1			0
june @entity61 resigned shortly after the incident			0
" my client has gone from being a teacher 's aide to being a scapegoat , " attorney @entity150 told @entity1			1
@entity88 is now the principal at nearby @entity155			0
in 2013 , a district court judge allowed the father 's claims of state violations , including negligence , against @entity61 and @entity88			2
the judge tossed out the federal claims -- that the school district violated @entity164 and that @entity61 and school administrators deprived the girl of her civil rights			2
@entity164 is a federal law aimed at ending sexual discrimination in education			2
in part , it dictates how schools that receive federal funds must respond to claims of sexual harassment			2
" ( judge t. @entity177 ) found the board of education 's policies were proper			0
he found that the school administrators took appropriate action and complied completely with federal law as soon as they were notified of this unfortunate incident , " attorney @entity180 told reporters in 2014			0
@entity180 's firm represents @entity22 and the administrators named in the 2010 lawsuit			2
the firm has not responded to numerous calls for an interview			0
@entity1 reached out last year , when it first reported the story , and this week , as the network sought comment on the federal court agreeing to hear the case			1
in 2014 , the @entity197 's @entity196 submitted a 126 - page amicus brief to the @entity26 , disagreeing with the district judge 's order			0
the brief , submitted jointly with the @entity203 @entity202 , argues the school , in its capacity as a recipient of federal funds is " liable for ( its ) deliberate indifference to known acts of peer sexual harassment			2
" " if @entity164 imposes any responsibility on school officials to prevent sexual harassment , it surely requires a response when they learn , as here , that a 14 - year - old special needs student is about to be used as bait to catch a 16 - year - old student with an extensive history of sexual and violent misconduct , " federal attorneys wrote in the brief			1
on the same day the federal brief was submitted , the @entity221 , joined by 32 national and local organizations , submitted a brief supporting the family 's lawsuit			2
the @entity227 and @entity228 , the family 's attorney , have also submitted a brief to the @entity26			0
" it means a lot			0
it says that people actually care about what happens , " @entity20 told @entity1 months after the incident , the teen transferred to a school district out of state , but eventually dropped out of school before graduating			2
@entity20 continues to struggle , she said			2
" it 's hard for me to have good days , " she told @entity1			0
" i have days to where i just want to sit there by myself			0
i get angry faster , and i get insecure			0
" asked what might help her , she stressed the importance of justice and closure			0
" by actually having our day in court and letting everything be known , so that it wo n't happen again , " @entity20 said			1
a date for her case has not yet been set , but the court will likely hear oral arguments within three to five months , according the clerk 's office .			1

federal appeals court says it will hear case of girl , then 14 , used as rape bait
in 2010 , teacher 's aide used @entity20 in failed attempt to catch alleged sexual predator
" i just felt like i was set up by the teachers , " says @entity20 , now 19 years old
