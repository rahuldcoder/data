-- october 20 , 2009 @entity1 @entity2 - learn about the different enemies facing coalition forces in @entity5			1
@entity6 - find out why social networking sites are popular among cyber thieves			1
@entity9 - consider some of the challenges involving school buses around the @entity13 transcript this is a @entity16			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			1
@entity20 , @entity21 : social networking sites are offering new opportunities to criminals			1
we 're gon na explain what you should watch out for			1
i 'm @entity29 , and you 're tuned in to @entity0 ! first up : @entity2 @entity31 : if no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote , then a runoff election will be held			1
that is what it says in @entity5 's constitution , and that 's why the country could be looking at the runoff scenario			1
unofficial results from august 's election showed that the current president @entity44 with 54 percent of the vote			2
but the @entity46 threw out ballots because of fraud			2
and when an independent group checked the final tally , it found that president @entity44 only had 48 percent of the vote			2
the only group that can order a runoff : the @entity53			2
there was no immediate reaction from them yesterday			2
the situation is n't just affecting @entity5			1
it could impact @entity13 troops , as well			1
president @entity61 is reviewing a military request to send 40,000 additional forces to @entity5			1
but on sunday , a @entity65 official said it would be " reckless " to deploy more troops without knowing what kind of government @entity5 's going to have			1
the service members who are there are battling the @entity72 and the @entity74 terrorist group			2
but as @entity75 explains , those are n't the only enemies facing @entity13 forces			1
( @entity78 ) @entity79 , @entity80 , kabul : coalition forces are fighting fierce enemies in @entity5 , facing daily attacks by different groups with differing ideologies			1
and contrary to popular belief , it 's more than just the @entity72 and @entity74			1
captain @entity90 's job is to help distinguish the various groups pitted against the coalition : @entity93 , @entity13 @entity94 : the biggest issue that you are dealing with when you 're dealing with the different insurgent groups is that they all have different motivations for wanting to fight			1
and that causes where we have a lot of problems with how we engage them			2
are they groups that we can engage and have them cease and desist through peaceful means ? are they groups that we have to engage kinetically ? @entity112 : this map shows the greatest areas of concern			2
in the west of the country , the insurgent groups entail more of a criminal element , some with ties to the drug trade			2
in southern @entity5 you see the traditional @entity72 , a group that @entity124 still has some influence over			1
the groups and alliances become more complicated as you move east			2
in southeastern @entity5 bordering @entity130 , the dominant militants are from the @entity131 headed by @entity132 ; it 's an outfit more inclined than others to use suicide attacks			1
in the northeast , among the many groups is another major player : @entity139 , the leader of @entity140 , more commonly known as @entity140			2
and many of these groups have cross-border ties with @entity130			2
they are funded mainly by elements within @entity146 countries			2
@entity147 , @entity148 [ @entity149 ] : these are the most dangerous fighters because they have the foreign connections with their strong ideologies and refuse to make peace with democracy , liberalism and freedom			2
@entity112 : professor @entity157 believes that there are groups and militant fighters that can be reconciled , but many will continue to use @entity5 as their ideological battlefield			1
and as long as @entity5 remains poor and undeveloped , these groups are likely to have a strong sway over the population for some time to come			1
@entity75 , @entity0 , @entity166			2
( @entity167 ) @entity168 @entity31 : are you and your parents considering whether or not to get the h1n1 flu vaccine ? you might have some more time to decide			2
some deliveries of the shot are going to be delayed			2
officials say that is because production of the vaccine is taking longer than they had hoped			2
about 40 million doses were expected to be ready by the end of this month			0
now , it looks like that number will be closer to 30 million			0
as of yesterday , 11 and a half million doses were available			0
about eight million of those had been ordered			0
health care talks @entity31 : and in @entity187 the debate over health care reform has moved behind closed doors , at least for a while			0
that 's where lawmakers are working to combine different versions of health care bills passed by two separate committees , into this one single bill that will be presented to the entire @entity197			0
that could be ready by later this week			0
@entity199 @entity31 : and @entity13 officials involved in another set of talks taking place in @entity204			1
this one is about the future of @entity208 's nuclear program			0
the head of the @entity210 , who 's hosting the meeting , said it got off to a good start yesterday			0
participants talked about how nuclear materials made in @entity208 would be sent to other countries for further development and then sent back to @entity208 to be used in medical facilities			0
the hope in all of that is that the materials would only be suitable for medicine , not weapons			0
is this legit ? @entity225 , @entity21 : is this legit ? the state of @entity227 does n't have counties			0
@entity227 's local government districts are referred to as parishes , not counties			0
racial controversy @entity31 : @entity234 , a judge in @entity227 's @entity236 , has caused a national controversy after he refused to marry an interracial couple			0
the @entity239 calls that " a huge step backward in social justice			1
" and the newlyweds , @entity243 and @entity244 , who were married by a different judge in the parish , are fighting to have judge @entity247 dismissed from his job			0
@entity247 insists he is not a racist and says he 's performed marriages for black couples in his house			0
however , he does n't perform interracial marriages because he believes most of them do n't last , and he says he 's concerned about the couples ' children			0
@entity247 says he has no regrets about his decision , since it 's " hard to apologize for something that you really and truly feel down in your heart you have n't done wrong			0
" cyber crime concerns @entity31 : social networking sites let us connect with friends , but they can also potentially connect us with criminals			1
according to the @entity271 , popular sites like @entity269 and @entity270 are also popular among cyber thieves			1
last year , the @entity273 got more than 72,000 complaints about internet fraud involving more than $ 260 million in losses			1
how does that happen ? you click on what looks like an innocent link or video , or you answer an online request for money from a friend stuck somewhere overseas			0
once thieves have access to your account , they can run the same scams on people who are connected to you			1
some simple ways to protect yourself : read up on sites ' security policies , be careful what you click on , and change your password regularly			1
@entity296 @entity297 , @entity21 : time for the shoutout ! about how many @entity13 students ride the bus to school every day ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it around : a ) 12 million , b ) 24 million , c ) 36 million or @entity308 ) 48 million ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! approximately 24 million students take the bus to school			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity9 @entity31 : by now , most of you have probably seen the effects of this global recession in your schools			0
there may be fewer field trips , less money for activities , fewer bus routes			0
we blogged about that awhile back , and some of you argued that it 's dangerous to walk to school , or that you could n't get to school without the bus			1
it 's something a lot of us take for granted			0
( begin video ) @entity31 : they 're big			0
the sound of their engines is the last thing students want to hear when they 're not ready for school			1
one question during @entity343 week is are they safe ? according to the @entity345 and the @entity346 , yes , especially when compared to cars			0
there are 800 students killed every year going to and from school			1
98 percent of those deaths involve passenger cars , bikes , motorcycles , pedestrian incidents			0
only two percent involve school buses			1
the problem with buses is ... @entity359 , @entity360 : we 're seeing a lot of school districts cutting back on their transportation because their budgets are tight and they 're looking for ways to save money			1
@entity31 : so , what can be done about that ? @entity371 : if parents get up in arms and say we ca n't afford to let our children face the kind of risks they have to face when they do n't have school buses , then the school board will make the decision that they 'll keep the buses			1
@entity31 : beyond that , @entity383 of the @entity384 suggests contacting state lawmakers , because many local school districts get budget money from state legislatures			1
if elected officials realize how important bus funding is to voters , they 're less likely to eliminate bus routes			0
( @entity394 ) promo @entity31 : @entity396 is just around the corner , and we want to give you a chance to take part right here			0
send us an @entity402 giving a shoutout to someone who 's served in the @entity405 , and you might see yourself on our show			0
if you want your own @entity408 , have your teacher send in an @entity402 with a photo of your school			1
before we go @entity31 : before we go , it 's about time to go pumpkin picking			0
that one did n't make it			0
but no one in the crowd is disappointed			0
that 's because they 're all here to watch these pumpkins plummet			0
it 's actually part of a science lesson for students in @entity424			0
the whole point is to plunge the pumpkins off the roof and see just how far the guts of the gourds go when they fall			0
goodbye @entity31 : based on the reaction of the crowd , the event was a smashing success			0
you guys have a great day			0
we 'll see you tomorrow , i 'm @entity29 .			0
