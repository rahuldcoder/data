-- @entity2 leader @entity1 called thursday for the @entity3 to carry out an independent fact - gathering mission on monday 's @entity6 attack in the city of @entity8 , which resulted in civilian casualties			1
" the @entity3 should hold an urgent meeting to discuss the matter and stop this barbaric attack , " he said in a nationally televised address			1
in the attack , five houses were hit in @entity8 , which is west of @entity18 , and 15 people died , including three children , according to a government spokesman			0
@entity6 has said the target was a command - and - control communications node involved in coordinating attacks on the @entity2 people			1
" while @entity6 can not confirm reports of casualties , we would regret any loss of civilian life and we go to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties , " the organization said on its website			2
" this is in stark contrast to the @entity1 regime , which continues its policy of systematic and sustained violence against the people of @entity2			1
" but @entity1 angrily rejected the claim that the compound was anything but a residential area			2
" this is not a military factory , munition factory or military port or a fortified castle , " he said as video lingered over rubble			0
" it has no military identity			0
" " this is the jungle rule , " he continued			0
you do n't have any conscience			0
" he blamed the members of the @entity3 who approved the resolution in march that authorized the use of military force to protect unarmed anti-government @entity2 demonstrators			2
" you will be responsible for any outcome , " he threatened , " and you will regret it			0
" @entity1 singled out @entity66 president @entity65 for blame			1
" originally , you 're from @entity68 and originally @entity69 as well , " he said			0
" you sold out to @entity66			2
where will you go ? on @entity71 , you will be in hell			0
our dead will be in heaven , and your dead will be in hell			0
you ought to feel ashamed			0
" @entity1 then directed his vitriol toward the " so - called heroic pilots " who flew the @entity6 planes involved in the attack			1
" you know we do n't have any air defenses or military planes , " the @entity2 leader said , referring to the no - fly zone that @entity6 has imposed over @entity2			1
" you have long - range rockets and you have been flying over the @entity2 air territory without any deterrent			1
" he said @entity6 's true motivation was inspired by hatred			2
" you hate us because we are @entity96 , " @entity1 said			2
" you hate @entity2 and people who bear witness to @entity99 and @entity100			2
" @entity1 's late - night diatribe came hours after @entity104 embraced the @entity2 opposition as " an important dialogue partner " and urged an end to the fighting and a political solution to the crisis , state media said			1
" @entity104 is not seeking any private interest concerning @entity2 , and believes the @entity2 situation is essentially an internal issue , " said foreign minister @entity111 after meeting with @entity112 , chairman of the executive board of @entity2 's @entity114			1
@entity112 's was the first visit by a @entity2 opposition leader			1
he arrived in @entity104 on tuesday , according to the state - run @entity121 news agency			1
for the sake of the @entity2 people , @entity111 called on the two sides to " truly give peace a chance			2
" also wednesday , @entity129 foreign minister @entity128 urged an end to the fighting in @entity2 to allow for humanitarian aid to flow to the war - devastated @entity134 nation			1
speaking in @entity136 , @entity128 said @entity129 backs a cessation to hostilities to negotiate a way for a humanitarian corridor			0
@entity128 's comments came after he had been critical of reported civilian casualties in @entity6 airstrikes and said they threatened the credibility of the alliance			0
at a weekend summit in @entity148 , @entity3 @entity146 ban ki - moon said @entity2 was facing shortages of food , fuel and medical personnel and access to water services was dwindling			1
" the @entity3 's humanitarian efforts are taking place under extremely difficult circumstances , " he said			0
the @entity2 war erupted from anti-government protests in february			1
following a @entity3 mandate to protect civilians , @entity6 began bombing military targets in march			0
however , @entity1 still maintains control in @entity18 and other cities			0
meanwhile , pressure has mounted from @entity66 lawmakers to withdraw backing for the mission			1
" the fact is the president has not made his case to the members of @entity174 , he has not made his case to the @entity66 people , " house speaker @entity169 said wednesday			0
" we 've been in this conflict for 90 days and the president has n't talked to the @entity66 people for four or five weeks about why we 're there , what our national interest is , and why we should continue , " @entity169 said			0
the day before , senators @entity181 , @entity183 , and @entity184 , @entity185 , introduced a resolution to counter some of the criticism about the @entity66 role in @entity2			1
that resolution authorizes the commitment of @entity66 forces for one year while stressing the lack of support for any use of @entity66 ground troops .			0
