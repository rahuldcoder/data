-- stepped - up colon - cancer screening has helped slash death rates from the disease across the @entity4 in recent years , but not all regions of the country have benefited equally			1
according to a new study from the @entity10 , the drop in death rates has been considerably faster in the @entity11 than in the @entity12			1
in the early 1990s , the states with the highest rates of colon - cancer deaths were clustered in the @entity16 , @entity17 , and @entity18			1
within a decade , the study shows , the highest rates could instead be found in the @entity12 and @entity21 , thanks to sharp declines in the @entity11			1
death rates in @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , and @entity29 all fell by 33 % or more during that 10 - year span , whereas the decline was 15 % or less in six southern states , including @entity33 , @entity34 , and @entity35 , according to the study			1
@entity0 : @entity38 cancer : what increases your risk in @entity44 , the decrease in the death rate was n't even statistically significant , making it one of only two states ( along with @entity46 ) to see no measurable improvement			1
" the main factor is really [ that ] screening rates are lower in the @entity12 compared to the @entity11 , " says @entity48 , @entity49 , the lead author of the study and the vice president of surveillance research at the @entity10 , in @entity52			1
southern states are generally poorer than northern states , and they tend to have more residents without health insurance who may forgo the regular screening that experts recommend for people over age 50 , @entity55 explains			2
and as the study notes , @entity65 are also more likely to be obese and to smoke -- both known risk factors for colon cancer ( also known as colorectal cancer )			1
@entity0 : 10 states that consume too much fast food the new study , which appears in the july issue of the journal @entity75 , follows on the heels of a report released tuesday by the @entity78 ( @entity78 ) that highlighted nationwide gains in the fight against colon cancer			2
between 2003 and 2007 , the percentage of @entity4 adults ages 50 to 75 who had ever had a colonoscopy or other screening test increased from 52 to 65 % , according to the report			2
the benefits of the wider screening could be seen in the national death rate from the cancer , which declined from 19 to 16.7 per 100,000 inhabitants over the same period			0
( @entity55 and his colleagues used some of the same data sources as the @entity78 researchers			0
) colon cancer screening saves lives , but more need to do it			0
the importance of screening is borne out by the state data in the new study , says @entity103 , @entity104 , an associate professor of gastroenterology at the @entity106 , in @entity107			0
in states that showed reductions in mortality rates of 20 % or more between 1990 and 2007 , she notes , at least 55 % of the target population was screened in 2004			2
" all of the states that have really changed their mortality a lot are screening more of the population , " she says			0
poverty is a key factor in the regional disparities seen in the study , says @entity121 , @entity49 , an associate professor of health behavior and health promotion at the @entity124 , in @entity125			0
not only do poor people have less access to health care , @entity121 says , but they may also be getting confusing messages about screening			0
colonoscopies can be prohibitively expensive if not covered by insurance , but many doctors believe they are the only acceptable option and fail to suggest fecal occult blood tests , a more affordable alternative that uses stool samples			1
@entity0 : which colon - cancer screening test should you get ? " you have [ a ] disconnect between what people can afford because they 're uninsured , and what providers will recommend , " @entity121 says			0
" the best colon - cancer screening test is the one that gets done			0
" the new findings provide more evidence that colon - cancer screening works , but for many people , the tests remain a tough sell , says @entity152 , @entity104 , head of colorectal oncology at @entity154 , in @entity27			0
" it is hard to convince the average @entity4 to go to the doctor when he or she is healthy -- or to convince insurers that money spent on screening now not only saves lives but saves money later , " he says			2

within a decade , highest rates could be found in the @entity12 and @entity21
@entity65 more likely to be obese and to smoke -- both known risk factors
