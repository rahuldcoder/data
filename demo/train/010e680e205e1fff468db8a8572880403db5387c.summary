-- @entity1 , the suite of productivity tools used by millions , has finally come to the @entity3			1
the move is a significant one for @entity5 and its users			2
before , the popular set of tools , including @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 , was available only on @entity14 phones , which have captured a sliver of the smartphone market			1
the feature is available free in @entity19 's @entity18 for subscribers to @entity21 , the cloud - based version of @entity23 's business - like tools for home users			1
subscribers pay a monthly fee			0
@entity23 is intended for people who need to edit powerpoints or @entity10 spreadsheets on the go , not create them from their phones			2
the company said users can work with documents on their phones , and the updates will be transferred to those documents on pc versions			0
they 'll also be able to share documents from their phones			0
" when we launched @entity21 earlier this year , we committed to delivering regular updates and new capabilities to @entity21 subscribers , " @entity39 , general manager of @entity5 's office division , said in a blog post			1
" @entity46 for @entity3 is another great example of the value of subscribing to @entity21			1
" the announcement comes just days after @entity19 announced that its own @entity52 productivity suite will for the first time work with @entity14 systems			0
the @entity5 announcement serves as a counter , allowing the same kind of back - and - forth for the larger number of users who are already familiar with @entity23 , considered by many the gold standard of productivity software			0
there is no similar version of @entity23 optimized for the @entity62 , which has its own more fully developed web browser			0
@entity5 also did not mention whether it 's developing a version for @entity67 's @entity66 mobile devices			1
office for @entity3 is available now for users in the @entity71 and will soon rolled out internationally , the company said .			2
