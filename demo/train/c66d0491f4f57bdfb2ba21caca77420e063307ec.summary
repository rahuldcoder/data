-- if i can help one person battling this disease , who 's fighting for his or her life , stay positive by being stronger , then my goal has been accomplished			1
finding inner strength at a time when being strong seems like such an impossibility is what can pull you through cancer			1
the kids at @entity14 got me out of bed on days that i would n't want to			1
they 'd knock on my door and force me out of bed			1
force me to walk -- with tubes in their noses , barf buckets resting on tricycle handlebars , beads of courage clinking from their iv poles			2
every day was a lesson			2
it 's a lesson no one is prepared for , and ironically , you have no time to prepare			1
you are thrown into this , this nightmare , and within hours , your life , your plans , your goals , your future has completely changed			2
my proudest moment was during a scary clinic visit when i toyed with going into septic shock			0
my fever spiked , and my blood pressure plummeted -- never a good combination with no immune system			0
i was minutes away from @entity44 , and i do n't know what happened , but i rallied and fought , and my numbers turned around			0
the most awesome moment was walking out of the hospital for the last time			0
people need to know what goes on behind the walls on the oncology floor			0
it 's the scariest , most wonderful place you could ever observe			1
a monumental will to live			0
a parent 's reality , holding onto a tiny thread of hope			1
these kids exude strength , and it was their courageous fight that made me stronger			0
that i will never forget .			0
