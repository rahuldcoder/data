@entity0 , @entity1 -- as the sole @entity5 journalist covering a unique bicycle race in @entity1 last month , i was provided with a personal guide , a car with a driver and the promise that i was free to take any photographs i wanted			1
as a journalist , it seemed like an incredible opportunity to document a small snapshot of what @entity1 was really like			1
however , the promise turned out not to be completely true			2
at the border , before going back to @entity20 , a group of security guards confiscated my camera and erased all images they thought were inappropriate , or did not portray the country in a favorable light			1
the @entity26 was n't meant to see but with the help of a computer expert in @entity29 , i managed to get all the pictures back			2
officially , i only had two restrictions to obey during my trip : no photos of the military or military facilities and all shots of portraits of @entity37 and his son @entity38 had to show their entire figures			1
and i was under no circumstances allowed to walk off alone			2
my guide , @entity42 , was surprisingly friendly and talkative			0
contrary to the propaganda machine i was expecting , the 42 - year - old father of two talked at length about his days as an @entity46 student in @entity47 and his interest in international literature			1
his favorite author was @entity52 ; the last book he read was sir @entity55 's classic novel , " @entity56			0
" we also talked about why the outside world has such a negative view of @entity1 ; something he was very sad about			1
he loved his country and i chose my words carefully			0
many times i asked @entity42 if it was okay to take photos of police , guards , power stations , refineries , train tracks and other objects i suspected would be considered sensitive by the secretive regime			1
" go right ahead , " he would say with a smile			0
driving though the countryside , i asked the driver to stop by the small villages			1
" no problem , " said my guide			0
" just be polite to the peasants			1
they are not used to westerners with big cameras			0
" @entity5 race into @entity1 -- by bike by the finishing line of the cycle race in the city of @entity0 , i was running around trying to get good shots of the riders coming in as well as of spectators and the city itself			1
my guide had a hard time keeping up with me , but he never once told me to lower my camera or slow down			0
it was all very informal			0
after the race , i had a chat with the vice mayor of the @entity100 , @entity101 -- who to my surprise spoke fluent @entity104 after studying in @entity105			1
and in the evening i sat down with a couple of young women from the local tourist office and had a conversation -- in @entity110 through an interpreter -- about relationships and everyday life in @entity1			1
they explained that although some @entity1 marriages still were staged because of family ties to politics , almost all are today based on love			1
they said most of their friends and local teenagers are studying @entity110 to do business and network with the growing number of @entity20 visiting the region			1
the following day , i had my first clash with the authorities			0
after breakfast i decided to go for a walk alone			0
while the guides and the other officials were busy , i walked out the hotel to the parking lot by myself			0
i did n't manage to get more than 10 meters before a uniformed guard saw me and led me back to the hotel lobby and told my guide that i had wandered off			0
the real setback happened just minutes before i was to cross the @entity139 and go back to @entity20			1
at the border , a group of guards called me over and demanded to check my camera			2
despite my objections , one of the guards erased picture after picture			2
i tried to look over his shoulder to see what he was deleting , but he kept turning his back to me so i could n't see			0
every time he hit the delete button , i felt the frustration build			0
my guide said they were erasing " inappropriate " pictures , with no further explanation			0
in total , 90 images were erased from the memory card			2
behind the veil : a rare look at life in @entity1 i was annoyed but not surprised			1
back in @entity29 i got in contact with a small it company that specializes in data recovery			0
after leaving me waiting impatiently for 24 hours , they finally got back to me			0
all the photos had been saved			2
" when they deleted the file on the card , they did not delete the whole file instantly , it just released the space of this file for future use -- the content is still there , " @entity169 , owner of @entity170 explained to me			2
looking at the censored photos , i was surprised about the selection			2
some were of angry looking security guards with scruffy barracks in the background , others of government officials going through our passports			1
i could just about understand that			0
but others were in my eyes harmless , even scenic			0
there was an old couple walking alongside the cornfields , a family out in the countryside waving from their house , and a mother cycling with her sleeping baby on a seat on the back of her bike			1
one photo showed a volleyball pitch next to the customs building by the border crossing			2
why these images are not in line with @entity1 image guidelines is for me a mystery			1
but so are a lot of things about the world 's most isolated country			0
the @entity1 we rarely see			1
