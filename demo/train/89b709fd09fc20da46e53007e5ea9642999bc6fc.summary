" we 're calling for help from another country and the first roadblock they hit is at our border			2

" i believe they even ran the license plate on the truck to make sure it was legal			0
" in the past , firetrucks on emergency calls cleared border checkpoints in 30 seconds or less , @entity29 said , although he said identification is sometimes checked upon their return			1

the cause of the blaze has not been determined , he said			0
ten fire departments , including the @entity4 departments , responded to the fire			1
" would it [ quicker passage at the border ] have changed the outcome of the fire ? " @entity29 asked			2
" would the building have been burned ? of course it would			0
" but he said firefighters were getting fatigued fighting the fire and relief was delayed			1
" just the fact that it could happen and it could happen again is what has us worried , " he said			0
@entity112 has mutual aid agreements with fire departments in @entity115 and @entity16 , @entity29 said , and the county requests help from @entity16 fire departments about 30 times a year			0
it sends help to @entity4 a similar number of times , he said			2
