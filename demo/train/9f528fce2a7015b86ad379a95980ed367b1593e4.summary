-- imperfect though it is , journalism plays unique and essential roles in our society and in our democracy			2
journalism serves the public and the public interest in important ways different from any other profession			2
i believe in journalism guided by sound ethical principles and built on competency , commitment and courage			2
i have a serious concern with news reporting ( as distinguished from the opinion role of journalism ) that is driven by ideological bias or activist intentions			1
my concern is with any and all forms of ideology from the left or from the right and with any argument that attempts to justify activism			0
my concerns are rooted in my strong belief in the ethical principle of independence that can and should guide the practice of serious , substantive journalism			2
i 'm not arguing for a false sense of " objectivity			2
" rather , independence is about commitment to professional duty that serves society rather than one 's own beliefs and self - interest			1
i have n't read @entity47 's commentary , nor have i viewed the " @entity49 " @entity0 documentary			1
thus , my perspective is framed by my beliefs about journalism , what it does well and what it can do better			0
journalists have an ethical and professional duty to pursue the truth about significant issues and events and to strive to report that elusive truth as accurately , fairly and fully as possible			0
journalists gather and process a great deal of information and try to make sense of complex and often contentious issues			0
they report on the strengths and weaknesses of our economy , our government and our communities			0
they take us down the block and around the globe to give us an understanding of the good , the bad and the ugly happenings in our lives			0
journalists take us to battlefields to tell us stories of horror and heroism , and they take us to classrooms to report on success , failure and hope			0
all this is aspirational , of course			0
journalists , like all professionals , are inadequate at times			0
one gives his or her best effort recognizing there are many variables that prevent perfection			0
i do n't believe that ideological bias is the major problem that erodes quality and corrodes credible journalism			1
this is much more of a perception problem than a reality			0
it 's a false premise to suggest that most journalists come from an ideological position that reflects personal belief that creates biased reporting			1
to categorize journalists as liberal or conservative fails to recognize that many individuals -- including journalists -- have a range of views on issues that move along a spectrum			1
i know journalists who hold what we traditionally think of as liberal views on certain social issues who , at the same time , also hold what we traditionally think of as conservative views on economic issues			1
i know journalists who hold liberal views on some social issues -- favoring gay marriage , for instance -- while at the same time holding conservative views on other social issues -- expressing a strong pro-life position on abortion , for instance			1
i know journalists who personally hold contrasting liberal and conservative views on tax policy and health care reform			1
most of the journalists i know can not be labeled as liberal or conservative , because they hold a range of views that are at different points on the ideological spectrum			1
how , for instance , would one categorize a journalist who holds the following beliefs : opposed @entity144 military force in @entity145 but favors it in @entity147 , calls for a much stricter immigration policy with no amnesty , favors the ordination of women as @entity153 priests , opposes all forms of abortion , favors capital punishment ? is that person liberal or conservative ? how can we accurately and fairly characterize journalists as conservative or liberal ? how then could we challenge the journalism they produce as driven by conservative or liberal bias ? furthermore , if a reporter allows his or her personal beliefs to become bias that could undermine reporting , good news organizations have checks and balances that minimize any skewing			1
therein lies my deep concern with the so - called " guerilla journalists " who are attempting to right wrongs			1
their starting premise is flawed by a distorted perception of the practice of journalism and by a false characterization of the beliefs of journalists			1
the " guerilla journalism " mission is further undermined by their use of questionable -- often unethical -- methods to report stories			0
there are many weak points in the underbelly of @entity144 journalism			0
we need to attract the best and brightest to the profession			0
we need journalists who are smart , skilled , committed and courageous			0
we need journalists who reflect all aspects of diversity in our society , and , yes , that includes ideological diversity			1
let 's improve the process and the product in the right ways , not by ideological activism			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity212 .			2

ideological bias is not the major problem that erodes credible journalism , @entity212 says
he says the problem is the false premise that most journalists have an ideological position
