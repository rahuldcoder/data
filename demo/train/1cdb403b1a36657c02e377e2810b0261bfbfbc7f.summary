-- in a scene from @entity4 's " parenthood , " two parents are attempting to get their 8 - year - old son ready for school			1
the child insists on wearing a pirate costume to class , again			0
his father asks him to take it off so he wo n't get teased			2
his mother says it 's ok , mainly so she can get him out the door on time			1
it could be a scene from any prime - time comedy			1
but its context in " parenthood " is unusual			0
the 8 - year - old boy , the son of main characters @entity22 and @entity23 , has been diagnosed with @entity25 's syndrome , an autism spectrum disorder			1
what is @entity25 's syndrome ? perhaps because tackling a sensitive issue such as living with a child with special needs can take a deft touch from the writers , producers and actors , a storyline dealing with autism spectrum disorders is n't something that 's been portrayed often in @entity39			1
the most recent regular prime - time character with @entity25 's was @entity42 on @entity44 's " @entity43			1
" the character 's run lasted from 2005 until the show ended in 2008			1
another @entity44 show , " @entity49 , " introduced a short term character during the 2008 - 2009 seasons			2
dr. @entity52 appeared in a three - episode arc			0
" parenthood " is one of the few shows that have included a regular character with @entity25 's from the beginning			1
the show has gotten good reviews in general and favorable comments from people affected by the disorder			0
one @entity0 reader named @entity64 , who has an 8 - year - old with @entity25 's , wrote , " overall i think it 's been really true to the behavior our @entity25 kids display -- which is often confused for being naughty or a lack of discipline			1
thanks for doing your homework @entity4 ! " because the show has received good reviews and positive feedback from families affected by the disorder , it may seem apparent that including a character with @entity25 's was a good move			1
executive producer @entity83 says it was n't so clear at the beginning			0
" i think there were moments everybody had of whether to do it , including myself , " he said			0
" i felt like it was a big thing to take on			0
it 's a very personal thing to me			0
" he 's not exaggerating			0
he has a son with the disorder , and though he had an intimate knowledge of dealing with @entity25 's , he sought out experts to help shape the characters and the stories			1
" when i decided to take this on , i felt an enormous responsibility to make this as real as possible , " he says			0
the show consults with psychologists , teachers and other parents " to make the depiction of both this character and his parents as accurate as possible			2
" a behavioral therapist consultant works with @entity111 , the actor who plays @entity112 , and with @entity113 and @entity114 , the actors who play @entity112 's parents , @entity117 and @entity118			0
the consultant also works with other cast members whose characters interact with @entity112 and with the show 's directors			2
@entity4 has been very supportive , @entity83 adds			2
he said there was a conversation with the network , not about whether to introduce the storyline , but how quickly			0
@entity128 , the executive vice president of @entity129 , the country 's largest autism science and advocacy organization , said his group had n't worked with " parenthood " on scripts , but @entity128 was on set recently to be a part of the may 18th episode			1
he had a chance to talk with the actors and production staff			0
@entity128 called the cast and crew " thirsty " for information about @entity25 's and autism			1
" i was really struck by how wonderful they all were and how interested in the topic they are			0
" the work the cast and crew has put into the show seems to have drawn the audience 's interest			2
the day after the episode in which @entity112 was diagnosed , @entity25 's was one of the most searched subjects on @entity155			1
he says a character like @entity112 can help take the mystery out of @entity25 's , which is important for people who are dealing with the disorder			1
not everyone has been pleased with " @entity134 's " treatment of autism			2
@entity165 commented on @entity0 's @entity167 blog that the show " misses the mark sometimes on @entity25 's traits			1
" she says while she 's glad to see a show trying , " parenthood " gets more things wrong than right			1
@entity175 writer @entity174 , the owner of a business that supports families with autism and the mother of a boy who was diagnosed with autism five years ago , has taken issue with how the writers are handling @entity112 's education			2
in an early episode , @entity22 and @entity117 meet with a teacher at @entity112 's public school , who says @entity112 does n't fit there			2
@entity112 is almost immediately moved to a private school			0
in her post , @entity174 notes laws require public schools to provide an education to all students , even if the schools must make accommodations for special needs students			0
she said the writers could have drawn some good stories from showing @entity117 and @entity22 advocating for @entity112 in the public school			0
" i know the drama of it all was captivating			0
there 's also drama in the fact [ parents of autistic kids ] have trouble with the public school system , " she said			0
she also thinks the show has n't delved deeply enough into the financial and emotional strains an autism diagnosis can put on a family			1
she understands the show can only do so much , but " i wish maybe they had dialogue about how this costs so much money , " and how making changes in a child 's care and education can change the family dynamic			1
" i would be critical because i know what it 's like , " he says			0
" you want to be truthful to the situation , but you 're also storytellers			0
" @entity174 says she enjoys the show , and through her @entity231 page , she 's heard from other moms of autistic children who liked the depiction of what @entity23 goes through			2
she says it 's great more people are hearing about autism , " but it 's not the regular autism family story			1

@entity4 's " parenthood " portrays a family in which the son has @entity25 's syndrome
autism in its various types is n't often depicted in prime - time *television*
producers use consultants to keep the storyline as accurate as possible
the show has faced some criticism over lack of realism
