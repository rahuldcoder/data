the morning tide keeps time on the barrier islands of @entity2			1
it slowly washes away tiny tracks left by newly hatched sea turtles that wobble into the surf under the cover of darkness			2
meanwhile , dolphins play in the waters close to shore as brown pelicans hover in competition to snack on schools of fish			2
the @entity16 were home to @entity18 long before 1584 when sir @entity19 attempted to make @entity22 the first permanent @entity21 settlement in the new world			1
a little more than a century later , the pirate @entity24 unscrupulously assaulted @entity25 , marauding and terrorizing merchants			2
the @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 lighthouses were built and rebuilt throughout the 19th century to help ships avoid the " graveyard of the @entity34 , " and the @entity35 made history 's first recorded flight in @entity38 at the beginning of the 20th century			1
@entity2 is history , a vacation destination , a home to endangered wildlife and a geological wonder combined into one national park site on @entity47 's coast			1

@entity107 is on @entity22 about three miles north of @entity108			1
meet our ranger : @entity111 is the district interpretative ranger for @entity2			1
the seeds for @entity111 's career in the park service were planted when his aunt gave him a subscription to @entity118 as a gift for his 7th birthday			1
@entity111 , now 44 , grew up in @entity121 and says ranger @entity123 's adventures taught him environmental ethics			1
while attending the @entity125 , @entity111 sought out nature during spring break instead of following classmates to traditional destinations			2
" i would n't go party , " he says			2
" i chose national parks instead			2
" @entity111 changed his major to geology after spending a summer volunteering at @entity49			2
after graduation , he joined the @entity135 and helped develop cave national parks in the @entity138			2
he then worked seasonal ranger jobs until landing his first permanent job in the park system at @entity143 's backcountry office			1
he came to @entity2 in 2010			1
" it 's a barrier island , one of the three most dynamic geological formations ( along with volcanoes and glaciers ) in the world , " he says			1
" we 're having a ball here because there are so many fun things to do			2
" for a day trip , do n't miss : seashell hunting on the beach , touring one of the lighthouses and watching the sun set over @entity99			0
" it 's rare to see sunset on a body of water on the @entity165 , " he says			1
favorite less - traveled spot : nighttime on the beach			1
@entity111 says @entity30 has the darkest night sky on the @entity165			0
in addition to stargazing and watching ghost crabs scramble across the sand , he says , hot summer nights cause the water to glow with bioluminescence			0
" i ca n't get enough of it here , " he says			0
" the night sky blows me away			0
" favorite spot to view wildlife : the boardwalk near @entity93			0
@entity111 says the boardwalk leads guests through bird ponds to a gazebo , where they can also watch crabs chase fish			0
" there is always great wildlife sightings no matter what time of day , " he says			0
most magical moment in the park : his first trip kayaking on the @entity99			0
@entity111 says @entity99 is not deep and is a relatively safe body of water			0
almost every village on @entity2 rents kayaks , and he recommends paddling along the shore to " bliss out			1
" " it all has to do with peace and tranquillity , " he says			0
" whenever i take my kayak out , i 'm seeing turtles and brown pelicans			0
" moment that made him smile : raising a camera to photograph a young couple at @entity93 and seeing the guy get down on one knee			0

" i just went crazy taking pictures			0
there are a lot of ( wedding ) proposals at the top of lighthouses			0
" @entity111 says the woman accepted , and he was happy to share news of the marriage engagement with the other guests on the tour			0
@entity221 moment at the park : a music teacher giving students a demonstrative lesson on sound resonance by playing a didgeridoo , a wind instrument used by @entity230 aborigines , at the base of @entity90			1
" it was way out there , but i really liked it , " he says			0
" the crowd waiting applauded when he finished			0
" a ranger 's request : educate yourself about rip currents before entering the water and do not go swimming at sunset or sunrise			2
@entity111 says rip currents are common at @entity30 because of small sand dunes that build up in shallow water			0
when the water gets pulled back out to sea , it punches holes in the dunes , creating the pull for rip currents			0
@entity111 says the way to escape a rip tide is to remain calm and float on your back			0
the current will take you out about 100 yards , he says			0
from there you should swim parallel to the shore until you clear the pull			0
" people try to swim out of it and you ca n't , " he says			2
" @entity267 could n't do it			0
