-- you know those little " winglets " that point up from the tips of airliner wings ? those were developed by @entity6			1
and , you know those little grooves in runways that channel away standing water ? @entity6 again			1
@entity12 's space agency is n't just about space			0
it also develops ways to make our airliners safer and more efficient			0
guess what ? you may have been flying with @entity6 technology for years , and did n't even know it			1
shape - shifting wings ? they 're coming now , an ongoing project could radically change the way airliners look and , more importantly , save hundreds of millions of dollars a year in fuel costs			1
@entity6 calls it the @entity30 project , or @entity30			1
it 's best described in three words : shape			2
those words sound like science fiction , but @entity6 and a company called @entity37 are developing wings that change shape in response to flight conditions and weather			1
@entity44 very strong composite materials make it possible			0
what does that mean to air travelers ? you 've probably looked out the window of an airliner to see the hinged metal flaps on the rear edge of a wing			2
new flexible materials allow the wing to change shapes without hinges			1
@entity6 shows off new flight technology this week , @entity6 invited dozens of aerospace bloggers and social media mavens to see new aviation technology at its @entity63 in @entity65 's @entity64 , about 100 miles north of @entity66			1
they got an exclusive look at @entity6 's flexible wing project and other ongoing research aimed at aviation			1
they also got a chance to hang out with engineers and pilots			0
then , they tweeted about it			0
project manager @entity78 compared the flexible wings to " watching a bathtub bend			1
you do n't expect something shaped like that to bend into a very fluid looking shape			2
" if these new wings end up on airliners in the coming decades , they 'll transform our flying experience into smoother , more comfortable and less expensive journeys			0
but do n't expect them until after 2025 , said @entity78			0
so , the big question about the flexible wing is pretty simple : how does it work ? that 's a proprietary secret			1
@entity6 is prohibited from telling us			1
but here 's what the @entity6 engineers could say : it morphs to compensate for changing flight conditions			1
in the future , " a pilot could be flying through a strong gust and the wings adjust so passengers wo n't feel the forces of the gust , " @entity78 said			2
it could change the way engineers design airliner wings			0
" now we have wings that are made heavier to withstand gusts , but with this technology , they may not have to design heavy wings like that anymore , " said @entity78			2
moving wings in - flight a three - member crew of a heavily modified @entity124 has been flight testing this new wing material			1
inside the cockpit sits a mascot : a little stuffed animal named @entity130 , the prehistoric squirrel character from the film " @entity133			0
" @entity6 loves its acronyms , so @entity130 has been defined as the " @entity135			2
" the test flights climb to around 40,000 feet and accelerate to about 75 % of the speed of sound			0
never far away is a chase plane , in case an issue comes up and they need an exterior set of eyes on the wings			0
the wing material " is just one , smooth surface , " said @entity6 test pilot @entity145			1
" it 's very , very solid			0
" right now , the wing is adjusted before each flight , not while airborne			0
once this test program is complete , the next step would be to design a new wing			0
" i would think that wing would be moveable in flight , " said @entity145 , " and it will make a big difference			0
" someday this new wing technology may join the list of @entity6 innovations that have made air travel safer and more convenient			1
here are five big examples 1			0
airborne wind shear detection a weather phenomenon called wind shear poses danger to airliners during takeoffs and landings			0
wind shear involves sudden changes in wind speed , horizontally or vertically			0
airplanes now have sensors that can predict it while in flight			0
in the 1980s and ' 90s , @entity6 conducted wind shear research and validated the technology surrounding the sensors			1
digital fly - by - wire older airliners used heavy cables and pulleys to connect the cockpit controls to the wings and tail			2
now , thanks to @entity6 research in the 1960s and ' 70s , pilots control newer airliners via electronic wire - based systems			1
lightning protection standards airliners are safer from lightning strikes now , due to @entity6 research during the 1970s and ' 80s			2
what @entity6 learned has helped protect airliner avionics and electronics from damage by lightning strikes			2
engine nozzle chevrons chevrons -- serrated shapes on the rear edges of the nacelles , the jet engine housings -- cut noise in the cabin and on the ground			0
these were developed thanks to @entity6 computer simulations in the 1990s and 2000s			2
winglets vertical extensions developed by @entity6 during the 1970s and ' 80s led to airliner " winglets , " which allow planes to slice through the air more efficiently , saving fuel and money .			1

@entity6 and @entity37 are developing shape - shifting wings for airplanes
flexible wings would save millions in fuel and smooth the ride for passengers
@entity6 showed off its wing technology to bloggers and social media mavens this week
@entity6 has *contributed* heavily to innovations used in *commercial* aviation
