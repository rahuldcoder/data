-- @entity1 says he did n't consciously seek a cause to support -- it found him			1
for eight seasons and in more than 300 episodes , the host of the @entity5 's " @entity4 " met hard - working @entity8 doing work that no one else would do			1
but these were all jobs that help make the world go round			2
the show , inspired by @entity1 's grandfather , a plumber , aimed to celebrate the men and women in trade jobs			1
but in 2008 , the tv show host became in demand as a spokesman on employment issues			2
" the economy went sideways , and suddenly i found myself in this weird position of being associated with hundreds of jobs in all different types of work , " says @entity1 , who will host the upcoming @entity0 series " @entity25 ta do it			1
" " so reporters started calling me to get my opinion on things like the widening skills gap and crumbling infrastructure and currency evaluation and outsourcing and all sorts of stuff i 'm not really qualified to talk about , but because i was in that space , i had kind of an interesting perspective , and i started to say things along the line of you know i know unemployment is headline news , but everywhere i was going on ' @entity4 , ' i saw help - wanted signs			1
" @entity1 says the folks featured on his show were telling him the same thing			1
" they all said how hard it was to find people who were willing to retool , retrain , learn a truly useful skill and apply it , " he says			2
@entity1 says he realized his mission was to bring attention to this disconnect and get people talking about the skills gap			1
and so he created a foundation called @entity61			2
" @entity62 evolved to shine a light on a lot of jobs that for whatever reason were going unloved			2
welders , steamfitters , pipe fitters			0
... and so it began as kind of a @entity75 campaign for hard work and skilled labor , " he says			1
" i challenged the fans to help build a trade resource center online , and they sent thousands of links to these apprenticeship programs and scholarships and on - the - job training opportunities			1
so all of that came together , that worked			0
" @entity1 's foundation awards what he calls " work - ethic scholarships			1
" " this is money for kids who are willing to learn a truly useful skill			0
get up early , stay late , work their butts off			2
you know ? so @entity61 wants to reward the place where we think all success starts -- work ethic			1
so that 's our scholarship plan , " he says			0
beyond scholarships , @entity1 says he wants to take the stigma out of trade jobs and schools			1
he says people need to change their attitudes about what comes after high school			0
as a youth , his guidance counselor warned him not to waste his time on a two - year school after graduation because it was beneath his " potential , " he says			0
the counselor " went on to show me this poster			0
this crazy poster in his office			0
a recent graduate holding his degree and looking very happy and optimistic next to a mechanic , head down , covered in grease			0
and the caption ( said ) , ' work smart , not hard , ' " @entity1 recalls			1
" we 've had this false choice , you know , this idea that those careers are ( for ) people who really are n't cut out for college			0
this implicit suggestion that they 're subordinate ; well it 's not a mystery that today it 's those very careers that are lacking			0
you know ( we ) need people in those careers			0
that 's where the opportunities are , " he says			0
@entity1 says attitudes toward employment and education must catch up with the times			1
" we 're still saying things like work smart , not hard			2
go get your four - year degree , trillion dollars in student loans , lending money we do n't have to kids who ca n't pay it back , educating them for jobs that do n't really exist anymore , it 's all twisted up			2
" he says he 's not against college degrees or academic approaches , but he wants people to know they are n't the only way -- all avenues should be championed that can lead to success			0
@entity1 is out on the road on what he calls " a @entity75 campaign for hard work , " bringing his message to anyone who will listen			1
he talks with fans through social media and meets with government officials , even taking his views all the way to @entity177			0
" we need to promote an ethic of work			1
and there 's no way one guy or one company is going to be able to do it			0
it has to be a big hot mess -- public , private , government , @entity191 and smart alecks on the tv talking about it			0

*ex-* " @entity4 " host says he set up foundation to promote hard work
he says public needs attitude *adjustment* about views on trade jobs and schools
@entity206 offers what he calls " work - ethic scholarships "
" we need to promote an ethic of work , " @entity1 says
