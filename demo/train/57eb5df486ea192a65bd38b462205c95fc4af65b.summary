-- the chance to run a marathon through the capital city of the world 's most mysterious country was too good an opportunity to pass up			0
so , when the 27th annual @entity8 , held in @entity9 last weekend , was thrown open to amateur runners from outside @entity11 for the first time , i made sure i had packed my running gear			1
officials said that runners from 27 foreign countries took part , but the experience was n't just unique for the few of us who had made the trip			1
from the moment we arrived in the reclusive @entity24 state , we were met with a mixture of fascinated stares and wary expressions			0
outside the imposing @entity29 stadium , where the race began , we had the chance to have our photos taken with spectators and @entity11 runners alike			1
posing with the race 's local contestants really emphasized the stark contrast between the @entity11 and us -- while we were kitted out in all manner of fluorescent brand - name sports gear , the @entity11 wore drab kits and ancient , battered running shoes			2
before the start gun , all 1,000 racers -- local , foreign , amateur and professional -- paraded through a capacity crowd of 50,000 spectators inside the stadium			1
expressions in the crowd were a mixture of smiles and bemusement , with no shortage of laughter at how out of place the tourists looked as we struggled to keep in formation			0
two worlds the look of wonderment was mutual , as we cautiously waved at the crowds who replied with cheers and waves of their own			0
at this point my pre-race nerves were overtaken by the surreal realization that i was taking part in the @entity11 's foremost athletics event			2
during the short opening ceremony and as we prepared to set off , runners were told not to take any photos			2
good thing too , as we endured one false start -- much to the hilarity of the crowd and the obvious displeasure of race officials			1
the course allowed us an up - close and personal view of the streets of @entity9 , as well as its residents			1
plenty of high fives , " hellos " and " anneyongs " ( @entity11 for " hi " ) were exchanged between runners and spectators , as well as the ubiquitous puzzled looks			2
unlike most distance running events , there were no barriers along the way and no sponsorship billboards -- essentially we were just out running the streets , directed around the course by race officials			1
close up , the only way to describe @entity9 is as though it 's stuck in a 60s time warp			1
the real @entity9 i thought we might have only run on the grandest and smartest streets in the city , but in reality we took some pretty uninspiring roads past some very dismal and empty - looking tower blocks			1
unlike other marathons i 'd attended in @entity111 and the @entity112 , this race lacked facilities such as portable toilets			2
instead , certain buildings that lined the route were designated runners ' toilets -- some were actually located on the second floor of buildings and as far as 50 meters from the road			2
as we ran through the streets of the city we got a close up view of @entity11 urban society			0
row after row of expressionless uniformed soldiers marching in unison , right behind groups of giggling school children waving to us , as well as weather - beaten faces of the older generation , who occasionally showed us a toothless grin			0
unlike inside of the stadium , the crowds seemed to be regular residents , although it 's worth remembering that @entity9 resident are the very upper echelons of @entity11 society			1
" i think it 's a rare chance to observe and interact with @entity11 even if you 're running through a planned route , " @entity146 , from @entity147 but living in @entity148 , told me after the race			2
" i almost feel like i bonded with the locals ... even if just to a very small extent			0
" unique running event before the race itself , there had been some confusion over the cut - off time for the marathon , ranging from three and a half to four hours			1
i made it round in a little over four , by which time the course had become very sparse			0
this meant that for some stretches i was actually running alone on a @entity9 street a few feet from workers passing by on rickety bicycles and elderly women hand in hand with their grandchildren			1
had i been a few minutes slower i would n't actually have been allowed to officially cross the finish line in the stadium -- a few behind me did n't manage to complete the race in time , despite having already run so far			1
this is quite different to major city marathons where runners are often allowed up to seven or eight hours			0
sadly , i was n't able get a picture perfect finish side by side with a @entity11 -- they 'd all finished well ahead of me -- but i did get 50,000 @entity11 spectators in the stadium cheering me across the line			0
it symbolized what was , from start to finish , a good - natured event and demonstrated the unifying quality of sport , particularly one as universal as running			0
the event is by no means a fun - run , as the four hour cut - off time might suggest			0
only about 30 foreign amateurs went for the full marathon , and it seemed like each amateur @entity11 was there to race			1
there were n't any runners in ridiculous costumes , or tv cameras to document it or taking part medals for runners , but given the circumstances this is to be expected			1
in terms of city marathons the scale was very small , but it was well organized			0
bizarre , fascinating experience " for me it was a uniquely bizarre , fascinating experience , " @entity212 , a @entity148 - based @entity213 runner told me			2
" obviously we are getting a one - sided view of the country but it 's at least one perspective , one glimpse into the country			0
meeting just one friendly foreigner , one conversation can have a big impression			0
and i must say that the guides were amazing and i greatly value the candid conversations i was able to have with them			0
