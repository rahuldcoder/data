-- @entity1 announced a major overhaul to its privacy controls wednesday , adding a handful of features while simplifying and clarifying the ways users can already tweak their accounts			1
the changes , which will roll out over the next few weeks , include a new tool that lets users ask for photos of them to be removed from the site			1
also being upgraded is a tool that lets users see what other people can -- and ca n't -- see on their @entity1 pages			1
in addition , users will get more control over the apps they enable on the site by gaining the ability to grant permission for some access requests but deny others			1
@entity1 says the changes are designed to help users better control , and understand , the information they 're sharing on a site with roughly 1 billion accounts			1
" we deeply believe that surprises are bad , " said @entity30 , @entity1 's director of product development			2
" when users are surprised , no one wins			0
" during its rise from dorm - room project to the world 's largest social network , @entity1 's most persistent complaints from users have centered on privacy			1
online privacy advocates and even elected officials have objected on occasion to how @entity1 handles user data			2
the company has consistently argued that appropriate privacy tools are in place , although @entity30 acknowledged they have n't always been clear or easy to find			1
" it was pretty subtle , and we believe it was n't clear enough to users , " he said			0
here 's a look at some of the updates , which @entity30 compared to some of the site 's biggest changes in its eight - year history : a " @entity60 " tool for photos facebook users could already click to ask other users to remove tags of them on photos			1
but the new tool lets them request that photos be removed from the site entirely , and it gives the recipient the ability to do so with a single click			1
it also gives users the ability to select a reason for the request without having to begin a potentially embarrassing conversation themselves			0
" if you do n't want something on @entity1 , it should n't be on @entity1 , " @entity30 said			0
" we need to give you the tools to address that in a straightforward way			0
" more specific app permissions currently , approving an app on @entity1 requires agreeing to a sometimes intimidating list of permissions for the app to do things like access your friends list and post on your timeline			0
new changes , which will roll out first on @entity100 's @entity99 mobile platform , let users give an app basic permissions to start with and then approve other , specific access requests when the app needs them			0
not all apps will move to the new model , however			0
perhaps most significantly , games wo n't change			0
privacy shortcuts a frequent complaint among privacy advocates has been that the controls that exist on @entity1 are hard for the average user to find and understand			2
" [ @entity114 ] he privacy settings are confounding even for the most experienced digerati , " danah boyd , a social - media researcher and privacy advocate , wrote for @entity0 during a 2010 privacy update			2
" people should be able to understand @entity1 's changes and have choices available that allow them to make appropriate decisions			0
" under the new changes , there will be a privacy icon on @entity1 's blue toolbar that takes users to the site 's most used privacy tweaks ( " who can see my stuff ? " " who can contact me ? " " how do i stop someone from bothering me ? " )			1
@entity137 content for privacy will also be simplified , with tools that are currently divided between the site 's @entity141 sections pulled together in one place			2
" obviously , security and privacy are deeply tied together , " @entity30 said			0
" we knew that they were related , and we wanted to call that out			0
" expanded @entity149 the @entity149 , rolled out last year , lets users manage the information that appears on their timeline			0
the updated version includes new navigation tools and will let users more easily see photos , status updates or other posts that may have been removed from @entity158 but still appear elsewhere on @entity1			1
it includes simplified tools to let users " view as " other people ( a feature that already exists ) to see whether they 've hidden or displayed posts the way they wanted			0
want to keep some @entity1 activity hidden from your grandmother or your boss ? this tool is for you			2
@entity30 said new messages will begin appearing on users ' pages , explaining the changes as well as more clearly outlining how existing privacy tools work			1
he said @entity1 will also be killing a little - used " who can look up my timeline by name ? " tool , saying new features will make doing so easier .			1
