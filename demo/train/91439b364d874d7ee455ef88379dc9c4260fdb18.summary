you probably wo n't see executives from @entity2 and @entity3 cozying up at some corporate event anytime soon			1
in its second such complaint this week , @entity3 told @entity7 sen. @entity6 that @entity2 's takeover of @entity9 would give the merged cable behemoth the leverage to extract higher fees from content providers , costs that would ultimately be passed on to consumers			1
" the proposed merger will result in online video content providers paying higher prices for access to @entity2 customers or delivering poorer service to customers who depend on @entity2 for broadband access , " wrote @entity3 vice president @entity16 in a letter to @entity6			1
" ultimately , competition and consumers will suffer , " he continued in the letter , made public by @entity6 's office thursday			2
" that is why @entity3 opposes the merger			2
" @entity3 's letter to @entity6 came on the heels of its monday letter to shareholders , in which ceo @entity35 and cfo @entity36 argued a merged @entity2 - @entity9 could " charge arbitrary interconnection tolls for access to their customers			1
" of course , @entity3 is no impartial observer in this deal			0
the company pays @entity2 for access to its vast network of @entity7 cable subscribers and does not want to absorb any fee hikes imposed by a newly dominant @entity2 - @entity9			1
@entity2 fired back this week , accusing @entity3 of distorting the facts			1
" @entity3 should be transparent that its opinion is not about protecting the consumer or about @entity52 , " said @entity2 senior vice president @entity48 in a rebuttal posted online			2
" rather , it 's about improving @entity3 's business model by shifting costs that it has always borne to all users of the @entity56 and not just to @entity3 customers			0
" the dispute comes as the @entity59 is proposing new rules that would allow internet providers such as @entity2 to create a " fast lane " for certain websites and services			0
the rules have drawn fire from advocates of net neutrality , the concept that access to the internet should be equal for everyone			0
with @entity6 , @entity3 may be preaching to the choir			2
the senator from @entity73 has been a vocal critic of the @entity2 takeover			0
" the danger in allowing @entity2 to accrue even more power is not purely hypothetical			0
the company is already using its dominant position to dictate terms to content providers seeking to reach its 20 million customers , " @entity6 wrote in an opinion piece published on @entity78 earlier this month			0
@entity6 has no real say in whether the $ 45 billion merger will be approved , however			0
that power rests with the @entity89 and the @entity59 , whose regulators must decide whether the deal violates antitrust laws			0
a combined @entity2 - @entity9 would bring cable or internet service to about 30 % of @entity7 subscribers and serve 19 of the country 's 20 largest metropolitan regions			1
that would bolster @entity2 's current status as the nation 's largest tv , @entity56 and home phone provider .			1

@entity3 sent @entity7 sen. @entity6 a letter opposing @entity2 's takeover of @entity9
@entity3 fears merger would give @entity2 - @entity9 leverage to extract higher fees
@entity2 accuses @entity3 of distorting the facts
*federal* regulators must decide whether the proposed deal can go through
