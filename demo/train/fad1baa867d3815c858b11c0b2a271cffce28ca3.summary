-- it has been four years since @entity2 won a major title , but the former world no. 1 insists he still has time to beat the record held by his hero @entity6			1
the " @entity6 " won his last major at the age of 46 , six years after his 17th triumph -- and @entity2 , stuck on 14 wins , says he plans to play for just as long			1
with the fitness routine and eating properly and staying in shape i could play for a very long time and i 'm looking forward to that opportunity , " the 36 - year - old @entity2 told @entity0 's @entity10 in an exclusive joint interview with his heir apparent , @entity12			1
" if you say hypothetically 10 years , that 's 40 more major championships i get a chance to play in and compete in and try to win , and hopefully i can try to at least win five of those			1
" woods , @entity12 ' too tired ' for $ 7m @entity24 tournament woods ended a long wait for a title of any kind in march , won again in june , and overtook @entity6 on the all - time @entity30 list with his third victory of the season in july			1
it was his 74th overall , putting him behind only @entity34 's 82			0
however , over the the last four years @entity2 ' best finish in a major was 11th , and he has been plagued by constant questioning about his ability to follow up his last win at @entity40 -- which came at the cost of a serious knee injury that sidelined him for several months			1
" every press conference i go to i get hammered -- ' oh you 're never going to win again blah blah blah ' -- and it was every tournament i went to , " said @entity2 , who ended 2012 second on the @entity30 money list behind @entity12 with more than $ 6 million in earnings			1
" it was a lot there for about a year and a half where i had to answer that question every single round , pre-tournament , and to do that all a lot and then to pass @entity6 on the all - time win list this year and do it 10 years younger than him , i think that 's a pretty neat accomplishment			1
" @entity12 beats @entity2 in chaotic ' duel of @entity60 ' this year @entity12 won his second major , the @entity61 in august , at the tender age if 23 -- slightly younger than when @entity2 won his second at the same event in 1999			1
" i 'm halfway there to the career slam , " @entity12 said			2
" i 've won two , and when i get my third i want to try and get my fourth			2
" it 's never been something that i 've put a number on -- obviously i looked up to @entity2 so much as a kid and obviously he 's always had that goal of trying to surpass @entity6 's number and maybe one day i 'll think about it a little more and try and put a number on it , but right now i 'm at two and i want to get to three			1
" i think the next big goal for me is if i could win the career gland slam , it would be a huge point			2
not many players have done it in the past and it would be great to add my name to that list			0
" will @entity12 join @entity2 at @entity90 in $ 20m a year deal ? at the peak of his powers , @entity2 held all four major titles after 2001 's @entity96 victory -- three of them coming in the previous season			1
it 's the closest any golfer of the modern era has been to a calendar grand slam -- a feat only achieved by @entity106 in 1930 when two of the tournaments were amateur championships			0
" it was just the best run of golf that was ever seen , " @entity12 said of @entity2 ' achievement -- known as the " @entity111			1
" " holding all four major championships at the one time is incredible , " added @entity12			2
" it is probably just a pity that it did n't all happen in the one year because i am not sure that would ever happen again			0
" @entity12 and @entity2 were both criticized for missing the @entity120 event in @entity24 immediately after their " duel on @entity60 " exhibition last week , citing fatigue in a busy end to the season			1
but @entity12 insisted his biggest challenge is to avoid burnout			2
" one of the biggest things for me is longevity			0
i have still got a lot of years ahead of me			0
i just do n't want to be burnt out , " he said			0
" i do n't want to get to the stage where i am 30 or 35 years old and i ... i do n't want to say fed up with the game , but it is a long time to be playing the sport and i just want to pace myself			0
" i think @entity2 has done that so well for the last 15 years and that is something that i am going to try to do going forward			2
" @entity139 : ' @entity12 can dominate like @entity2 ' @entity2 said he fully understands the pressures @entity12 is facing as one of golf 's biggest drawcards , having blazed that trail himself for more than a decade			1
" everyone is going to be trying to bring you to their event , deter you away from time that is spent practicing , " said the @entity145			2
" how did you get there ? you did n't get there by sitting on your butt the entire time , you got there by working hard and doing all the things you need to do to prepare , and people are going to be trying to take you away from that			0
" so trying to manage one 's time -- for me that has been the biggest key			0
" some guys they just show up and they try to practice just for the week and build themselves into it			0
i would much rather practice at home , be ready			0
" when i go to an event it is to win , period			0
i learned that at a very early age			0
