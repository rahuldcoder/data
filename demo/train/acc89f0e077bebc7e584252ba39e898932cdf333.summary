-- in recent years , so much has been going on in the world of commercial aviation that putting together a " top 10 events " forecast has been easy -- major new airplane programs have been announced , airline consolidation has taken place and disputes between @entity9 and @entity10 over carbon emissions have held major airplane orders hostage			1
looking at the year ahead , it 's a challenge to muster a list of five events likely to grab the general public 's attention , much less 10			2
the year 2015 is more about program execution			1
new airplanes from @entity20 and @entity21 are scheduled to enter service ( @entity23 ) in 2015 and the @entity24 , scheduled for delivery to its first customer december 22 , will also see its @entity23 in january			1
@entity28 's 787s are in a lull : more than 200 have been delivered and the next version , the 787 - 10 , is n't scheduled for delivery until 2018			2
@entity32 is between airplanes , so to speak			0
its new , re-engined @entity34 is n't scheduled for delivery until 2018 and the current generation @entity34 marches on			2
yet even though they do lack the pizzazz of years past , there are still a handful of important events and milestones to look forward to in 2015			1
new airplanes to enter service the @entity45 , the @entity46 , and the @entity47 , are supposed to enter service in 2015			1
each is powered by the @entity50 ( @entity51 ) , a 20 - year research - and - development gamble that brings @entity53 back into the arena as a major player in single - aisle airplane powerplants			1
" supposed to " because new airplane programs from @entity20 , @entity28 and @entity21 have been replete with delays			0
so far , the flight - testing of the @entity45 -- which had its first flight in september -- seems to be going flawlessly , but unknowns can emerge			0
the @entity45 's @entity23 is scheduled for october			0
for @entity47 , @entity23 of @entity21 's bet - the - company jump into the big leagues with its first " mainline " jet is an event that was originally supposed to happen in december 2013			1
then the fourth quarter of 2014			0
the first flight of the airborne test program did n't happen until september 2013			2
the planned fourth quarter 2014 @entity23 may have been achieved had it not been for a major engine failure of @entity53 's @entity51 during a ground test in may			2
the fault was traced to a poorly designed oil seal and not the game - changing engine architecture			2
the entire flight test fleet was grounded for three months while the cause and a fix were identified			0
had cseries been on time , it would have been two years ahead of the @entity45			0
now , it 'll be a toss up as to which airplane enters service first			0
according to the @entity88 investment bank aerospace analyst at @entity89 , @entity47 should have its eis in october 2015			1
@entity21 will only say the second half of 2015 , but @entity91 , a major supplier on the @entity93 engine , narrows this down to the fourth quarter			1
@entity23 for two airplanes in the same month or the same quarter , or even the same year , is a major industry event			1
for @entity20 , the @entity24 , the response to the @entity28 and the challenge to @entity28 's flagship 777 - @entity100 , was set to be delivered december 22 to launch customer @entity102			0
the real flow of deliveries and service entry begins in january			0
declining oil prices mean increased profits the price per barrel of oil dropped dramatically in 2014			1
it 'll probably continue to fall in 2015			0
some believe the price could hit $ 40 a barrel			0
if so , it probably wo n't stay there for long before rebounding to $ 60 - $ 80 and , maybe , back to $ 100			1
do n't expect any order cancellations or deferrals because of lower oil prices			1
the lower oil prices may give new , short - term life to some older airplanes like the @entity28 757 , 767 , 777 and 747 - 400 ; and @entity122 and early @entity123			1
but that 's about it			0
do n't look for lower airfares driven by cheaper oil , either			2
airline management knows this is a time to reap profits that are elusive in a high - oil price environment			1
air shows will be lackluster as always , international air shows are huge industry and media events			1
this coming year , the @entity135 is in june and the @entity136 is in november			1
unlike the air shows of recent years , at which airplane program launches were announced , the @entity140 airplane manufacturers -- @entity20 , @entity28 , @entity21 , @entity32 -- have tapped out their new airplane launches			1
@entity142 and @entity143 will focus more on commercial airplane orders than anything else , and even these are expected to be off compared with previous years			1
the peak of the order cycle has come and gone and for the moment , we 're on the downside of the bell curve , especially with oil prices falling and reducing the urgency to place more orders			1
besides , with @entity20 and @entity28 backlogs out to 2020 , there are few slots available for which to place orders			0
@entity160 , the @entity161 - based turbo - prop manufacturer with more than 80 % of the market , might announce a major upgrade of its venerable @entity160 - 42/72 series with a new engine , new wing and other systems , but turbo - props command neither the market size nor the headlines of the big jets			2
an @entity172 ( neo ) , while important to the airlines , wo n't capture the imagination of the air show or reporters			1
@entity179 aviation marches along ... slowly @entity181 's @entity180 ( @entity9 ) , the challenger to the @entity183 and @entity185 families , is in development and so is the equivalent @entity188 ( @entity187 ) , but neither will take to the skies in 2015			2
the @entity192 / @entity191 ( @entity9 ) is supposed to enter service in 2015 after a seven - year delay , and this time it actually might do so			1
but only a few have been sold outside of @entity9 and prospects that there will be more orders are dim			0
the airplane is largely a learning effort by the @entity9 on how to develop an airliner , and the experience has been painful			0
the @entity203 , @entity205 's first commercial airliner since the 1960s , is set to enter flight - testing in 2015			2
@entity209 flight - testing will draw geek attention the real aerospace geek will watch for the flight - testing of the @entity209 aerial refueling tanker for the @entity214			0
the airplane , based on the commercial @entity216 , is already late and approaching $ 1.5 billion over budget			0
its first flight was supposed to be last fall ; now it 's planned for this spring			0
even @entity28 and the @entity214 are n't sure when the bird will fly			0
@entity28 won the contract in a bitter , bitter fight with @entity20 , which proposed its @entity224 ( multi-role tanker transport )			0
although not without its own challenges , the @entity224 is in service in @entity227 and @entity228 and has been ordered by several other global air forces			2
@entity230 is managing director of @entity232 , which provides consulting services to the aerospace industry .			0

the coming year wo n't yield as many big aviation stories as years past
the @entity238 and @entity47 are expected to enter service in 2015
declining oil prices should help airlines reap increased profits
major air shows will be lackluster compared with years past
