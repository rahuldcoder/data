@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has cut the price of the @entity5 by $ 100 , or 17 percent , in the @entity6 , a move that should boost the video game console 's lackluster sales			1
starting monday , the current @entity11 gigabyte model will cost $ 499 -- a $ 100 price drop			1
the @entity5 , which includes a 60 - gigabyte hard drive and a @entity15 high - definition dvd player , will now cost $ 500 , or $ 20 more than the most expensive version of @entity18 's @entity17			1
the @entity11 still costs twice that of @entity22 's @entity21 console , whose $ 250 price and motion - sensing controller have made it a best - seller despite its lack of cutting - edge graphics and hard disk			1
" our initial expectation is that sales should double at a minimum , " @entity31 , chief executive of @entity32 , said in an interview			0
" we 've gotten our production issues behind us on the @entity5 , reaching a position to pass on the savings to consumers , and our attitude is the sooner the better			0
" the price drop monday was widely anticipated by industry analysts despite @entity3 president @entity45 telling @entity2 last week that the company had no immediate plans for one			2
@entity49 analyst @entity48 said @entity3 's price reduction would not double sales but may boost them by 50 percent to about 120,000 units a month			2
" the greater significance is that @entity3 is signaling to the market that we 're coming down the cost curve pretty fast in making this thing			0
it 's a pretty consumer - friendly move , " @entity48 said			0
@entity3 's move comes two days before the start of the video game industry 's annual @entity63 trade show in @entity65 , @entity1 , where some expect @entity18 to respond with its first price cuts on the @entity17			1
@entity22 , whose @entity21 is selling so well that it is still hard to find in stores eight months after its launch , is not expected to budge on pricing			2
the @entity17 and @entity21 have outsold the @entity11 by several times in the crucial @entity6 market , leaving @entity3 , whose @entity74 dominated the last console generation , in the unfamiliar position of playing catch up			1
@entity3 is counting on the price cut to help it significantly grow sales of the @entity11 ahead of the crucial holiday shopping season that accounts for most of the annual sales of highly profitable gaming software			2
@entity3 is also introducing a new version of the @entity11 featuring an 80 - gigabyte hard drive and a copy of " @entity88 , " an off - road racing game that has already sold a million copies			1
the new model will sell for $ 600 and is aimed at gamers who expect to download a lot of games and other content from @entity3 's burgeoning online network			2
@entity3 also hopes the @entity11 will win some converts following @entity18 's admission last week that the failure rate of its @entity17 console had been unacceptably high , forcing it to book $ 1 billion in repair costs			1
" we 're especially proud of the fact that the @entity5 has the lowest failure rate of any @entity105 product			0
it 's absolutely the gold standard , " @entity31 said			0
" the quality of the product and long - term viability is what ultimately wins			0
