the @entity39 champion will play @entity41 veteran @entity40 for a place in the quarterfinals after the 13th seed beat @entity45 of @entity46 , 4 - 6 6 - 2 7 - 5 6 - 4			0
big - hitting @entity48 @entity47 is also in @entity1 's section of the draw and he came through after a four - set battle with @entity52 of @entity53 , 3 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 4 7 - 5			1
the seventh seed must first get past unseeded young @entity56 @entity55 , who underlined his potential by dispatching ninth ranked @entity59 of @entity5			1
after his 7 - 6 5 - 7 7 - 5 7 - 6 win over @entity59 , @entity55 said he was confident of repeating the dose			1

@entity46 's @entity76 had to battle long and hard to clinch his place in the last 16 after a five - set tussle with @entity80 's @entity79			1
