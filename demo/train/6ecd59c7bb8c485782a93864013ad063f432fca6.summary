@entity0 -- sen. @entity2 of @entity3 wednesday declared victory over fellow @entity6 @entity5 in the nation 's last @entity8 race , saying the result of her write - in candidacy was a " miracle			1
" " @entity15 , we as @entity3 together made history , " @entity2 told cheering supporters in @entity14			1
if she prevails in a potential challenge , @entity2 would become the second person to ever win a write - in bid for the @entity8			1
@entity2 's statement was the climax in the state 's bitter and prolonged @entity8 battle			0
it was essentially a triumphant declaration of beating back a three - pronged attack : from @entity5 , from the @entity26 , and from @entity27			1
" we 've said all along , we 'll wait for the votes to be counted , " @entity2 campaign manager @entity28 told @entity1			0
" by any standard , this was a clear victory			0
this was a whuppin ' , " @entity28 added			0
currently , @entity3 's @entity35 is counting 100,868 votes for @entity2 versus 90,448 for @entity5			1
by that count , @entity2 leads by 10,420			0
however , 8,153 of @entity2 's votes have been contested by the @entity5 campaign			1
if , as @entity5 's side would like , all of those contested votes are thrown out -- an almost impossible scenario to many election and legal observers -- @entity2 would still win the race with the uncontested votes alone			1
" you can see that the numbers just wo n't add up , " @entity28 told @entity1 , referring to @entity5 's hopes of pulling out a win despite the rising tide against him			0
the @entity53 has called the race for @entity2			0
if the outcome stands in the face of legal challenges , despite a count of any outstanding ballots or a potential recount from @entity5 , it would be only the second time a person won a write - in campaign for the @entity8			1
@entity64 of @entity65 won a write - in campaign in 1954			1
at this point , @entity5 is conceding nothing			0
in an interview with @entity70 on @entity71 , @entity5 said he is " less cautiously optimistic " given the vote tallies			0
but @entity5 was emphatic about ensuring the integrity of the vote - counting process , asserting that the difference was " less than 1 percent			2
" he said he may request a recount , that he wants to ensure that some military ballots were mailed out , and that the difference between his votes and @entity2 's may shift if a " consistent standard " for evaluating the write - in ballots is applied			1
evaluating the write - in ballots has been controversial			2
as @entity3 's @entity35 tallied them , some ballots that contained misspellings or variations of " @entity2 " have been credited as votes for her			2
that issue of evaluating a " voter 's intent " has infuriated the @entity5 campaign , prompting it to launch a federal lawsuit in hopes of annulling the count of misspelled or incongruous ballots			0
@entity5 's campaign blasted the @entity99 ' standards as " extraordinarily ambiguous			0
" a @entity5 loss would be a huge slap to @entity27 and the @entity26			2
@entity27 endorsed @entity5 over @entity2 for the state 's @entity103 primary , and the national @entity26 group followed suit			1
@entity2 lost the primary in august -- and conceded the race			2
shortly after , @entity2 launched a write - in bid to retain her seat			1
@entity2 was first appointed to her post by her father , then - gov. @entity112 , in 2002			2
@entity27 defeated him in the 2006 @entity6 gubernatorial primary			0
@entity1 's @entity114 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 thanks @entity3 for helping make history
she ran as write - in candidate after losing primary to @entity5
@entity5 is backed by @entity26
