-- episcopal priests will be allowed to conduct services blessing same - sex relationships under a policy approved tuesday at the church 's national convention in @entity7			1
the convention 's @entity8 approved the provisional policy 111 - 41 with three abstentions monday , clearing it for consideration by the @entity13 , which approved it tuesday evening			1
the policy was approved in the @entity13 , following more than an hour of debate , by 78 % of the voting lay members and by 76 % of clergy			1
can ' true @entity19 ' favor same - sex marriage ? with the vote , the @entity21 becomes the largest @entity24 denomination to officially sanction same - sex relationships			0
the @entity21 has about 1.95 million members in the @entity24 , down 16 % over the last decade , according to the church			1
the service is not considered a marriage ceremony , media affairs representative @entity28 said			0
" we have authorized a blessing , and a blessing is different than a marriage , " she said			0
" a blessing is a theological response to a monogamous , committed relationship			0
" marriage requires the additional involvement of civil authorities , and many states do not allow gays to marry			0
the @entity21 policy calls for a three - year trial run of the blessing service , which is called " the @entity47 and @entity48			1
" it will be accompanied by a review process leading up to the church 's next annual convention in @entity53			1
it 's then that church leaders would decide whether to make the policy permanent , church media affairs representative @entity54 said			1
the vote in the @entity13 followed comments , including from advocates arguing the policy would be a step toward inclusiveness			1
delegate @entity65 of @entity66 said it was time for the church to honor lifelong commitments of people in same - sex relationships			2
" the signs outside our church says all are welcome			2
do we need an asterisk ? " but the rev. @entity77 of @entity78 said the policy advocates a " new theology " of human sexuality that is inconsistent with church canons and doctrine			1
the approval means the church is " marching off , not simply out of step , but completely out of line from the faith once delivered to the saints , " @entity77 said before the vote			1
the policy , which has been in development since 2009 , allows local bishops to decide whether to allow the service			1
it also includes a provision stating that clergy members who object to same - sex unions can not be coerced to perform the blessing , or be disciplined for refusing			0
as with civil politics , issues involving homosexuality have roiled @entity24 churches for years			2
in 2003 , the @entity21 in the @entity24 split over the election of an openly gay priest , @entity105 , as bishop in @entity107			0
and in 2009 , the church approved a policy allowing the ordination of homosexual @entity111 as priests			1
just this summer , the @entity114 and @entity115 churches rejected measures that would have granted formal church recognition to gay relationships			2
the @entity123 , at its @entity120 meeting in @entity121 , @entity122 , upheld the church 's position on homosexuality , which excludes gay marriages and same - sex unions			2
the @entity115 body also rejected a proposal saying the church is not of one mind on the issue of homosexuality			1
@entity135 is getting more gay - friendly this month in @entity138 , the @entity136 of the @entity137 decided not to change the church 's definition of marriage as being " between a man and a woman			2
" delegates approved a two - year study of the issue			1
the only major @entity24 denomination to endorse same - sex marriage across the board is the @entity150 , which did so in 2005			0
in 2009 , the @entity151 allowed member churches to recognize same - sex relationships , but stopped short of creating a churchwide policy or crafting a specific blessing service			1
during monday 's debate , bishop @entity156 of @entity157 said the policy would allow the church to focus on inclusion while respecting theological differences within the church , according to the @entity164			1
but others said the policy was a bad idea , the news service reported			2
" the @entity173 world is going to understand us as having changed the nature of the sacrament of holy matrimony , " the news service quoted bishop @entity170 of @entity171 as saying			0
" the @entity173 world will look at that liturgy world and see vows , and exchange of rings , a pronouncement and a blessing and they will understand that to mean the @entity21 has endorsed same - sex marriage and changed a basic @entity173 doctrine			0
i do not believe that we are free to do that			0
" @entity190 , a @entity191 religion professor and an @entity21 priest who supports the change , said he expects little fallout from the policy within the @entity24 church			1
most of the most conservative @entity111 who oppose blessing same - sex relationships have probably already left the church , he said			2
" in many ways , the church is tracking public sentiment , " which is increasingly supportive of same - sex relationships , @entity190 said ahead of tuesday 's vote			0
" the @entity21 is merely part of that trend			0
" he said it 's also unlikely to increase tensions with conservative elements of the worldwide @entity212 , of which the @entity21 is a member			0
" i really do n't think it will have a major effect			0
the real divisions already occurred over @entity218 's consecration in 2003 , " he said			0
but some conservatives within the communion might try to use the decision to further marginalize the @entity24 church , @entity190 said			0
as blood donations decline , @entity24 ban on gay donors is examined @entity226 pushes for gay rights with ' @entity229 ' campaign wed - locked : some same - sex couples denied divorce @entity232 : growing old openly gay @entity0 's @entity233 and @entity234 contributed to this report .			0
