-- for many decades , unlike their counterparts in many @entity5 countries , @entity2 police did not carry guns			2
even the armed police in @entity2 , charged mainly with guarding foreign embassies , government buildings and important facilities , would normally only carry unloaded guns , keeping the bullets separate			1
a police officer firing a gun was a rarity , because @entity2 was a safe country			2
recently , however , a major shift is occurring that is significantly changing the landscape , as @entity2 faces its own " war on terror			1
" with the war in @entity22 winding down , there has been an intensification of terrorist attacks in @entity2			1
most bear the same tell - tale fingerprints			0
they originate from @entity2 's @entity27 , which borders @entity22 , and are perpetuated by extremists from @entity2 's @entity30 minority , a mainly @entity32 - speaking @entity31 population			1
they aim to indiscriminately kill innocent , unarmed people in public places , demonstrating a complete disregard for human life			0
the deadly terror attack thursday on @entity39 , the capital of @entity27 , was the just the latest in a spate of such attacks to strike @entity2 since a jeep plowed into a crowd in @entity45 's @entity44 in october , killing five			1
this week 's attack also involved vehicles -- in this case @entity48 that drove into crowds at an open market as its occupants tossed out explosives , leaving at least 39 dead and 90 injured , according to @entity2 state media			2
other attacks have been carried out by knife - wielding mobs , such as the attack on @entity59 train station in march that left 29 dead , according to state media			0
an attack the following month on an @entity39 train station also involved a knife - wielding mob that swarmed the station after an explosion was detonated			0
three people were killed , included two suspected attackers , and 79 injured , according to state media			0
days later , men with knives attacked travelers at a train station in @entity71 , injuring six people , according to @entity2 police			2
there have also been foiled attempts at hijacking airplanes			0
faced with an intensification of such attacks , right - thinking people in @entity2 are united in unreservedly condemning these crimes against humanity			2
the @entity2 people want peace and stability at home , and many are demanding that the government take resolute measures to combat these terrorist attacks			1
in response , the @entity2 government has authorized the arming of police , and instructed them to shoot -- to kill , if necessary -- in combating such attacks			1
the government has also significantly beefed up the police presence in many cities , particularly at bus and train stations , airports , public squares , schools and other public places which tend to be the targets of such attacks			2

@entity2 @entity111 extremists have previously found their way to @entity22 , with some winding up in @entity113			1
@entity2 's concern is that such infiltration will see terrorist attacks in @entity2 intensify in coming years , in light of a likely resurgence of violence in @entity22 following the withdrawal of @entity122 and @entity123 forces from the country			1
faced with the potential threat of intensified terror attacks , @entity2 will need to significantly beef up law - enforcement capacities further and raise public awareness about potential attacks			1
@entity2 will also need to significantly increase international and regional cooperation to effectively deal with any resurgence of terrorism in @entity22 in the coming years			1
in this context , the @entity133 , the @entity134 in @entity135 , and other multilateral frameworks will have significant roles to play in rallying countries in this part of the world to unite in their common struggle against terrorism			0
effectively combating terrorism will require an international united front			0
the international community will not be well served if we start to label terrorist attacks against one country as terrorism , but terrorist attacks against another country by another name			0
put simply , an attack that aims to terrorize people by killing and injuring innocents indiscriminately is a terrorist attack -- and should be universally condemned and dealt with as such			0
double standards and hypocrisy will only further embolden terrorists , and will leave more innocent people as victims of such crimes			0
no decent person -- and no religion -- should condone or justify terrorism			0
if the international community is united , terrorism in @entity2 or anywhere else in the world will never win			2
let us unite in our common fight against terrorism and extremism in the world , and prevail .			0
