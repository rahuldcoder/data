as a plume of black smoke billowed from @entity3 after it crash landed at @entity5 last week , images were being captured -- not just of the plane itself , but of passengers ignoring official safety procedures and collecting their carry - on items before evacuating the aircraft			1
a photograph that showed several passengers , including a woman walking away from the smoking wreckage with a black suitcase and smaller white bag in her hands , has been widely circulated			2
the photo and reports of similar behavior have stirred up a stormy debate across @entity24 's social media platforms -- @entity24 nationals made up approximately half the passengers on the @entity28 flight that originated in @entity29 , according to the airline			1
" i am so disappointed those passengers think their baggage is more important than other people 's lives , " posted " @entity36 , " on @entity37 , @entity24 's @entity38 - like service			1
" and they had time to tweet the plane crash ( before ) helping others that are injured			0
" " @entity42 ( especially @entity43 ) do n't understand that in @entity24 , human lives are cheaper than money , " posted another , called " victory of @entity48			1
" " and this belief is deeply ingrained in the mentality of the @entity24 government and its people			1
" a similar tone and theme was prevalent across @entity37 but other netizens defended the passengers			1
" grabbing the bag is an instinct response , " wrote " @entity59			0
" " but as @entity24 , we should always keep in mind that human lives weigh more than our belongings			1
" did pilot have enough 777 experience ? communication problems ? many commenters chided passengers who did not read the aircraft 's safety briefing card or pay attention to verbal safety instructions			1
part of the investigation into the incident will look at @entity78 members ' verbal instructions during the emergency , what languages those instructions were in and how passengers responded			2
there can be no denying such an event can be chaotic and potentially confusing			0
according to the airline , flight attendants helped passengers get off the plane safely			2
they opened doors , deployed slides and helped passengers escape , according to @entity92 , a @entity93 newspaper			0
safety information available online from the @entity96 ( @entity96 ) emphatically capitalizes the instruction to " @entity98 " under its evacuation procedures			1
passengers are also instructed to : -- stay low -- proceed to the nearest front or rear exit -- count the rows between your seat and the exits -- follow floor lighting to exit -- jump feet first onto evacuation slide -- do n't sit down to slide			1
place arms across your chest , elbows in , legs and feet together -- remove high - heeled shoes -- exit the aircraft and clear the area -- remain alert for emergency vehicles -- never return to a burning aircraft some passengers have defended their decision to grab personal items before evacuating the burning aircraft , citing passports as a major concern			0
one of the most high profile passengers to do so was @entity126 , president of product development for @entity128 , the largest e-commerce platform in @entity24			1
" regarding some people who criticize me for taking my luggage with me and thus hindering the rescue of other passengers , i have to clarify , " wrote @entity126 on @entity37			2
" first , my family ( three of us ) sat in the same row , our bags were in the overhead cabin on top of our seats , we did n't stand in the aisle to take our things			0
" second , our passports , money , etc. , were all in ( our luggage )			0
i would be difficult if i did n't take it with me			0
" third , everyone was looking forward in the cabin at that time , it was n't too chaotic			0
no one was running behind us			0
my son said to us , ' we could get out ' ( through the hole in the aircraft , not the evacuation slide )			0
" shock and survival : plane crash through the eyes of children but @entity126 's explanation attracted criticism from some netizens			0
one , identified as " @entity163 " posted : " are you an idiot ? taking your luggage when you 're escaping ... ignorant and selfish ! ! ! you know your seemingly justifiable action may lead to the death of the others ? please read your safety manual carefully next time ! your possessions may be important to you , but even more so are the lives of others			2
" @entity126 's comments notwithstanding , the question remains why so many defied safety protocol -- and , perhaps , common sense -- by carrying their belongings off the plane			0
cabin crew well trained a @entity24 netizen named " @entity183 , " who identifies himself as a commercial airline pilot , posted his own summary			1
" a crew member from @entity188 complained to me that a lot of @entity24 people refuse to put on safety belts , adjust their seats or close the glare shield while the plane is landing , and they put over-weighted bags overhead			1
" some planes have to broadcast in @entity24 over and over again that if passengers refuse to cooperate with the crew , they will face a fine as much as $ 1,500			1
do n't these passengers know their bad behavior would kill them in emergency landing ? " the rush for belongings , even as potential disaster loomed , may raise questions about the way passengers are briefed for emergency situations			2
how does an air crash investigation work ? the news from @entity5 could have been far worse , and " what if " speculation abounds			0
" it 's a natural reaction in the chaos of a crash , to grab your things and run , i think , " said @entity214 , chief correspondent at @entity215			0
" but clearly there can be repercussions , from high heels puncturing the slide to bags blocking exits			0
" flight crew are trained to be extremely firm with passengers , ordering them about if necessary			2
it 's unlikely the crew were at fault			2
to get an operating license aircraft need to show they can be evacuated in 95 seconds			0
the problem here is with passengers ignoring safety instructions -- if we do n't comply , you could have problems			2
" interactive : what happened with @entity3 ? the @entity244 has yet to comment on or determine the impact passenger behavior had on overall safety and the efficiency of the evacuation effort			1
all quotes from @entity24 netizens translated from @entity251 by @entity252 .			1

@entity24 netizens buzz over images of passengers with luggage
safety *standards* make it unlikely crew was at fault , say experts
@entity244 investigations continue , will consider passenger behavior on evacuation
