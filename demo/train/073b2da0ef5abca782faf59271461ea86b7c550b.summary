" @entity1 , one of the @entity8 's marquee players , will practice this week and can play in sunday 's game against the @entity10 , despite facing a child abuse charge , team officials said			1
@entity1 , who was kept out of sunday 's game against the @entity13 , turned himself in to @entity15 authorities saturday , two days after an indictment alleged the 29 - year - old father did " recklessly or by criminal negligence cause bodily injury " to his son , a felony			1
@entity1 quickly posted $ 15,000 in bail and was released , according to the @entity22			1
in his first comments on the case , the reinstated @entity8 star told fans in a written statement posted on his @entity29 feed , " i never imagined being in a position where the world is judging my parenting skills or calling me a child abuser because of the discipline i administered to my son			2
" despite being advised by his attorney not to discuss details of the case , @entity1 wrote , " i want everyone to understand how sorry i feel about the hurt i have brought to my child			1
" he said that he voluntarily appeared before a grand jury and told its members the same thing , which also matches what he said he told two different police agencies about the incident			0
" i will say the same thing once i have my day in court , " he wrote			2
in disciplining his son in the same manner as @entity1 himself was disciplined as a child , he wrote , he unintentionally caused the boy injury			1
he understands that there are people who disagree with this form of discipline , he said , and he has met with a psychologist who informed him of more " appropriate " ways to discipline children			0
" but deep in my heart i have always believed i could have been one of those kids that was lost in the streets without the discipline instilled in me by my parents and other relatives , " he wrote			0
" i have always believed that the way my parents disciplined me has a great deal to do with the success i have enjoyed as a man			0
i love my son and i will continue to become a better parent and learn from any mistakes i ever make			0
" he closed his statement by saying that while he is n't the perfect parent , he is not a child abuser			2

" team stands behind its star player general manager @entity89 said more information about the incident was available to the @entity2 then the team had on friday when it placed @entity1 , a six - time pro bowler in his first seven seasons , on the inactive list			1
" this is a difficult path to navigate regarding the judgment of how a parent disciplines his child , " @entity89 told reporters			0
" based on the extensive information that we have right now , and what we know about @entity1 not only as a person but what he has also done for this community , we believe he deserves to play while this legal process plays out			1
" the developments came as @entity0 affilaite @entity109 reported that @entity1 allegedly abused another one of his children -- a 4 - year - old son			1
sources told @entity109 that the mother of the child filed a complaint with @entity116 in @entity15 because she alleged that @entity1 beat the child , while visiting his father at his @entity120 - area home			1
according to the report , text messages between @entity1 and the boy 's mother show that @entity1 admitted disciplining the child , but he claims the child hit his head on the car seat in the process			1
no charges were ever filed , according to @entity109			1
@entity0 reached out @entity116 , but has not received a response			0
through his attorney @entity132 , @entity1 vehemently denied the report			1
" the allegation of another investigation into @entity1 is simply not true			1
this is not a new allegation			0
it 's one that is unsubstantiated and was shopped around to authorities in two states over a year ago and nothing came of it , " @entity132 said			0
" an adult witness adamantly insists @entity1 did nothing inappropriate with his son			2
" one of the team 's sponsors , the @entity150 hotel chain , announced monday night that it was suspending its " limited sponsorship of the @entity2 while we evaluate the facts and circumstances			0
" report : photos show alleged injuries @entity1 's attorney has said his client used " a switch to spank his son " and was simply doling out discipline much like " he experienced as a child growing up in @entity15			1
" @entity1 " will continue to insist on his innocence of any intended wrongdoing , " @entity132 said friday			2
photos obtained by @entity169 allegedly show @entity1 's son 's leg covered in marks that could have come from a switch , or thin tree branch			1
some of the marks in the photo appeared to have broken the skin			0
" the photos are disturbing , i understand that			0
but to be clear , you know any matter that 's involving the child is very important for this organization			2
but we also think that it is right for him to go through the process legally , " @entity89 said			0
sportsradio 610 in @entity120 reported this past weekend that @entity1 allegedly sent text messages to the boy 's mother in @entity190 after the lashing			1
@entity1 wrote he " felt bad after the fact when i notice the switch was wrapping around hitting i ( sic ) thigh			2
" another text was more graphic			0
" got him in the nuts once i noticed , " it read , according to the @entity199 radio affiliate in @entity120			0
" but i felt so bad , n i 'm all tearing that butt up when needed ! i start putting them in timeout			0
@entity205 save the whooping for needed memories ! " the station said a later message from @entity1 was : " never do i go overboard ! but all my kids will know , hey daddy has the biggie heart but do n't play no games when it comes to acting right			1
" due in court on october 8 @entity217 assistant district attorney @entity216 , whose office made the case against @entity1 to a grand jury over a period of weeks , said prosecutors " will take this charge extremely seriously and we look forward to presenting this case to a jury			1
" the next step is a preliminary court hearing that is scheduled for october 8			2
@entity216 said he expected @entity1 to be there , although the decision is up to a judge			2
according to @entity15 law , people can be convicted of injury to a child if they cause bodily or mental injury " intentionally , knowingly , recklessly or with criminal negligence " or cause such harm by omission			0
the crime is punishable by up to two years in a state jail and a $ 1,000 fine			0
in @entity15 , someone can defend himself against a charge of injury to a child if he can prove it happened while he was administering " reasonable discipline , " @entity216 said			2
" obviously , parents are entitled to discipline their children as they see fit , except for when that discipline exceeds what the community would say is reasonable , " he said			0
" and so , a grand jury , having indicted this case , looked at the injuries that were inflicted upon this child and determined that that discipline was not reasonable			2
" as the @entity8 reviews the running back 's actions under its personal conduct policy , the @entity2 owners said they will " monitor the situation closely			1
" referring to the decision to keep @entity1 out of sunday 's game , the @entity2 owners , who are brothers , said , " on friday , we felt it was in the best interests of the organization to step back , evaluate the situation , and not rush to judgment given the seriousness of this matter			1
at that time , we made the decision that we felt was best for the @entity2 and all parties involved			0
" @entity1 is considered one of the best running backs in the @entity8 -- if not the best			1
his absence was probably felt during the @entity2 ' 30 - 7 loss to the @entity13 on sunday			0
in 2011 , he agreed to a lucrative contract , which @entity8 reported would be worth $ 100 million over a 7 - year period			0
opinion : spanking is n't parenting , it 's child abuse to spank or not to spank ? @entity0 's @entity283 , @entity284 , @entity285 , @entity286 and @entity287 contributed to this report .			1

new : @entity1 was accused of abusing another child , @entity109 reports
