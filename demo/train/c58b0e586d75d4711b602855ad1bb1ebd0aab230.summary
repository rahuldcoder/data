seeing all this waste pushed @entity18 , 27 , who formerly worked for a hedge fund , to start a business using surplus produce			1
the model for @entity26 in the @entity27 , her jam and chutney business , was born , with the goal using food that would otherwise get tossed to create foods that people would buy			1
" preserves seemed almost a natural thing to be doing with a glut of fruit and veg , because it then lasts up to 10 months , " @entity18 said			0
infographic : food waste ; from farm to fork and landfill the massive global problem of food waste has received more attention in recent years , and the figures are staggering			1

@entity78 , the @entity79 - based supermarket chain , in october achieved its goal of sending zero food waste to landfills			1

read : how severe weather impacts the global food supply " since day one , our first vision for this company , why we fell in love with it , was this idea of ' waste to food ' and ' waste to wages , ' â € ” that you could create a really cool company in an urban setting , create really good jobs out of what was waste , and something about that was so powerful to us , " @entity117 said			2
the company 's main product , a mushroom - growing kit , is a cardboard box that houses a plastic bag filled with coffee grounds and mushroom spawn			1
