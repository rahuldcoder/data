@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity0 has a disturbing reputation			2
the village outside @entity1 's capital of @entity6 is known as a place where little girls are openly sold to foreign predators looking for sex			1
one of the girls who was sold into the sex trade told @entity2 that before she could read she was working in a brothel			1
" i was about five or six years old , " she said			1
" the first man said to me , ' i want to have sex with you			1
' at the time i did n't know what to do			2
no one could help me			0
" dozens of girls have had the same experience in her neighborhood			0
she says she was approached by a man while playing outside			1
he asked her to come over and talk to him , and before she knew it she was alone and being asked for sex			1
some of the girls were actually sold into the sex trade by their own parents			2
many were housed with other girls her age in what looked like a cell			0
the room was pink had thick walls and no windows and was about 7 feet long by 7 feet wide			0
there were several rooms just like it stuffed into a building that had a gate over the front door and bars on the bathroom window			0
the brothel she lived in specialized in pre-pubescent girls			0
the young girls were sought after by the foreign men who came to the area for one reason : they knew they could find young girls for sale			0
" at the beginning they talked to me gently but when they raped me , they also beat me up , " the former sex slave said , her head bowed and tears rolling from her eyes uncontrollably			1
she is now 18 and no longer trapped in a terrible and painful life			0
three years ago she found a safe haven after @entity70 and his wife moved into the neighborhood and began operating a rehabilitation center for child sex slaves			1
" i really think it 's an evil -- i mean there is no understanding it			0
the girls , i mean , they 're in such pain and suffer so greatly and it is obvious to the man that 's raping them , " @entity70 said			1
@entity70 says things have changed in @entity0 in the past several years			1
it used to be girls who hung out in the open , beckoning from behind barred windows to the men who walked by			0
pimps no longer descend on every foreign man who shows up in the neighborhood offering to sell them virgins			2
while the situation is changing , there is still a nasty underbelly in the area , but travelers have to go looking for it now			0
the sex trade has gone underground , but it is still there			2
" if you just look on the surface you would say that does n't happen but just yesterday we rescued a 5 - year - old girl here in @entity0 , " said @entity70 , who works with @entity105			1
