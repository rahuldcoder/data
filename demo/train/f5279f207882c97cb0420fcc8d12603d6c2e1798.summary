-- try to imagine @entity1 or @entity2 dealing with a situation like this : the tap water 's only good for toilets , not drinking , washing , cooking or showering ; more than a dozen people have been hospitalized for complaints related to water that 's been contaminated with a somewhat mysterious chemical ; and residents wait in line for bottled water -- or for ice to melt -- in order to have something to drink			1
that 's been life since thursday in @entity22 's capital city , @entity23 , where 300,000 people were left without safe water -- again , except for toilet flushing -- after chemicals contaminated the @entity28			1
some of the taps have started coming back on ; cleanup and testing are underway , according to the news reports on monday			1
but the spill , which has been attributed to a leak in a chemical - storage tank not far upriver from the city 's water treatment plant , continues to paralyze @entity23			1
a @entity39 reporter described living in the city as " a lot like camping			2
" a resident was blunter : " it 's like a zombie apocalypse here			0
" where 's the national outrage ? our collective indifference is troubling			1
it 's like we think : it 's ok , the water 's safe to flush			2
or : whatever , it 's just @entity22			1
this would be the story everyone in @entity58 's talking about if chemicals used for cleaning coal were spilled into a river in a state with more political clout and media presence			1
take @entity65 , where gov. @entity67 's administration is accused of jamming up traffic as payback for a rival politician			0
the public has been ravenous for that story ; meanwhile , @entity22 matters just as much			1
at least it does to real people -- people who value safe drinking water			1
sure , i understand why the @entity67 scandal -- which we 're all calling " @entity80 " these days -- matters			0
he 's a national figure who has ( or had ) a good shot at being the @entity85 front - runner for the 2016 presidential race			0
there 's an alleged cover - up , a trough of juicy e-mails , calls for a federal investigation , and real people were inconvenienced			2
i 'm not arguing the bridge scandal is insignificant			0
but it 's sad that disasters seem to need brand strategists these days			0
" if we called @entity22 4 - methylcyclohexane - methanol leak ' @entity99 , ' do you think the political press would pay more attention ? " asked @entity97 , a columnist for @entity98			2
the answer , as she implies , is yes			0
@entity106 wrote for the @entity107 that none of the major sunday morning news shows gave much -- if any -- coverage to the chemical spill			1
" sunday shows to @entity22 : @entity113 ! " his headline blared			2
they were too obsessed with @entity67 , which , as he points out , has plenty of time to play out before the presidential elections , two years from now			0
this stuff goes way beyond the media and its handling of events			0
major newspapers and television networks , including @entity0 , sent reporters to @entity22 to cover the story			2
it 's not that no attention has been paid			0
but @entity22 is so maligned in our national consciousness that some people probably expect environmental contamination like this to happen there			1
the country should be in the middle of a national debate about how to ensure chemicals are kept out of our drinking water			1
it 's one of the most basic of government services			0
some people in @entity22 are trying to advance that conversation			1
take @entity148 , executive director of the @entity149			0
she told the @entity150 that , " we need to look at our entire system and give some serious thought to making some serious reform and valuing our natural resources over industry interests			0
" she and others also are asking the tough questions : why was a chemical storage tank allowed to be on a river that 's used for drinking water ? and why was n't the tank inspected since 1991 ? then there 's @entity164 , from the @entity165 , who reported that the @entity166 had recommended three years ago that @entity22 " create a new program to prevent hazardous chemical accidents			1
" it did n't , of course			0
let 's join @entity148 and @entity164 in their search for answers			0
that 's needed to ensure a spill like this never happens again			2
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity179 .			2

*noncontaminated* tap water is coming back for some @entity22 residents
@entity184 : our collective indifference to the disaster is troubling
300,000 people were without water after a chemical spill
@entity179 : @entity58 needs to debate how to keep chemicals out of drinking water
