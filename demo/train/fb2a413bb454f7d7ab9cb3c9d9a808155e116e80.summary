@entity0 , @entity1 -- the legal battle over a tough @entity1 immigration law entered its next stage thursday when gov. @entity6 filed an expedited appeal to the 9th @entity8			1
the appeal asks the court to lift a preliminary injunction granted by a federal judge that blocked the most controversial parts of the law			1
the court document suggests a fast - track timetable that would have oral arguments on the appeal on september 13			1
before then , @entity1 would file a substantive brief to the court and the @entity21 @entity20 would respond			1
the @entity20 responded to the motion thursday , opposing the proposed timetable that would force the government to respond in half the typical time allotted			1
" @entity21 is not going to sit back and allow the ongoing federal failures to continue , " @entity6 said in a statement			0
we are a nation of laws and we believe they need to be enforced			0
" following wednesday 's injunction , some legal experts expect that the fight between the federal government and @entity1 will reach the @entity21 @entity36			1
" we 'll win on appeal , " said @entity1 state sen. @entity37 , who wrote the law , known as @entity39			1
" i got news for the anarchists , " he added			0
" our laws will be enforced			0
" but @entity44 , an immigrants ' rights activist and a legal defender in @entity47 , @entity1 , said she is confident that wednesday 's ruling by @entity21 district judge @entity49 will prevail under appeal			1
" the court will not allow the state of @entity1 to criminalize undocumented immigrants , " @entity51 told @entity2			2
the judge 's ruling " gutted " the @entity1 law , @entity51 said			1
the preliminary injunction issued wednesday prevents police from questioning people 's immigration status if there is reason to believe they are in the country illegally			1
@entity66 also blocked provisions of the law making it a crime for people to fail to apply for or carry " alien registration papers " or " for an unauthorized alien to solicit , apply for , or perform work , " as well as a provision " authorizing the warrantless arrest of a person " if there is reason to believe that person might be subject to deportation			2
the parts of the law that took effect thursday include a ban on so - called " sanctuary cities " -- municipalities with laws or policies that render them relatively safe for undocumented immigrants			2
@entity37 noted that provision in the judge 's ruling			1
" it was still a victory for @entity1 , " he told @entity2 's " @entity93 " program			1
the judge also allowed a provision in the law that makes it illegal to hire day laborers if doing so impedes traffic			2
the parts of the law dealing with sanctions for employers who hire illegal immigrants also withstood the first legal test			2
despite the judge 's ruling -- or perhaps because of it -- tensions remained elevated thursday			1
several demonstrators who oppose the immigration law were arrested thursday afternoon in downtown @entity0 , where police blocked off several downtown streets and officers in riot gear were deployed throughout the area			1
@entity117 sheriff @entity116 said there were approximately 200 protesters oustide of a @entity0 jail			0
at least 15 protesters had been arrested , he said			0
@entity116 , a staunch supporter of the immigration law , and his department went ahead on thursday with a sweep where violators of the law are subsequently investigated to verify their immigration status			1
the sweeps do not contradict the judge 's ruling because there are other laws that allow the transferring of undocumented workers from state jails to federal immigration custody afterwards , he said			1
" nothing is going to deter the sheriff and my office , including rulings by the federal judge			2
so , business as normal , " he said			0
from the other side of the 2,000 - mile @entity21 - @entity148 border , the governor of @entity145 state noted that the law has produced " much tension " between the two state governments			2
" it puts a lot of tension to border states like @entity145 , " @entity152 told @entity2			0
@entity2 senior legal analyst @entity155 said the ruling reflects the government 's argument that immigration enforcement should be dealt with at the federal level			2
" @entity1 may have good intentions , they may be trying to make up for where the @entity21 government has failed , but what the judge is saying is , this is not the way to do it , " he said " i think this [ is ] a case very much destined for the @entity36 , " as other states pass similar laws , @entity155 said			2
@entity37 , author of the law , said he foresaw a protracted legal fight from the beginning			0
" i wrote it to go to the @entity36 , " he said before the ruling came down			0
" i 'm begging for that fistfight at the @entity36			0
we will win in a 5 - 4 decision and finally settle this problem			0
" he added , " my message to the judge , is uphold the @entity183			0
this is a battle of epic proportions			0
this is the states versus the central government			0
" the federal appeals court could take up the case in a matter of days , but the earliest the @entity36 could look at it would be october , because the high court is in summer recess			0
@entity2 's @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 and @entity198 contributed to this report .			0
