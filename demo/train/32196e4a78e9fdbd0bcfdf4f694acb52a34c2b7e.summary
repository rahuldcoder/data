-- in staging their @entity5 fireworks show , authorities in @entity2 , @entity3 , have faced challenges in recent years from @entity7			1
fireworks light up the sky over @entity10 , @entity11 , during the city 's 2008 @entity5 festivities			1
in 2005 , thick fog veiled the celebration			2
spectators could n't see the detailed patterns and colors of the fiery blasts -- they only saw the clouds and haze get brighter			0
thunderstorms erupted the next two years , delaying the show in 2006 and then forcing its cancellation in 2007			1
that year , storms brought winds that were just too strong			2
" we start taking a hard look at the direction and speed of the wind when it gets to 15 or more knots [ about 17 mph ] , " said @entity2 fire marshal @entity27			1
" at 20 knots , we consult the shooters ... to see if our perimeter is safe for the crowds			0
twenty - knot [ 23 mph ] sustained winds would probably be our cutoff			2
" as millions gather across the @entity43 on saturday to celebrate @entity43 's birthday with fireworks displays , fire officials will be watching weather forecasts and preparing to make sure revelers are as safe as possible			1
they often start by banning spectators from a safety zone , or perimeter , around the launch site to protect them from drifting embers that can get as hot as 1,200 degrees @entity53			0
for that reason , fireworks launches over harbors , rivers and other bodies of water can often be larger in scale			2
" for a venue like @entity65 , it is common for [ launch ] barges to be located on the water , well away from land , " said @entity61 , division manager with the @entity62			0
" even if the winds increase , it 's possible ... [ for ] the safety of the display not to be compromised			2
" fireworks shows originating on land have stricter standards for the size of the perimeter , depending on wind speed , because spectators are generally closer to the explosives , @entity61 said			1
strong winds can make safety trickier			2
according to the @entity87 , hundreds of people at a 2005 @entity5 fireworks show in @entity88 , @entity84 were accidentally showered with glowing embers when winds shifted about 10 minutes after the event began			1
high winds can even cancel a fireworks celebration			1
rain , however , will not necessarily stop a show , said @entity96 of @entity97 , a @entity99 , @entity65 - based fireworks production company that has choreographed shows for presidential inaugurations and the @entity102			1
fireworks do n't extinguish in the rain , and as long as operators " keep the powder dry , " they will explode , @entity96 said			1
moisture can cause them to change colors , though			0
" a brilliant blue may appear as a royal blue , " he said			0
weather challenges are nothing new for @entity115			1
in preparing for a large show in @entity118 , the production company once faced 105 - degree heat and a sandstorm			1
" they told us to simply kneel down and cover our heads with our capes and ride it out , " @entity96 said			0
ideal conditions for fireworks are calm winds , comfortable temperatures and clear night skies , @entity96 said			1
" when the sky is black and clear , it 's like a painter 's canvas for us			0
" some commonly asked questions about fireworks : do fireworks still work when it snows ? yes			0
for many @entity141 celebrations in cold - weather states , it 's often snowing during fireworks shows			1
fireworks production companies say the snow acts as a prism , reflecting and shifting the colors			0
what 's the biggest danger that spectators face from fireworks ? statistics show the vast majority of fireworks - related injuries are caused by over-the - counter fireworks instead of burning debris from public fireworks celebrations			2
the risk of fireworks injury is 2Â½ times higher for children than for the general population , according to the @entity62			0
the biggest culprit ? sparklers			0
the @entity62 advises against using your own fireworks			0
" leave it to the professionals			0
