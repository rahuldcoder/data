the government - run health insurance exchanges have been open for business for 20 days			1
but a host of issues have plagued the highly anticipated launch , making it difficult for both consumers and insurance providers			1
" there 's no sugarcoating it , " president @entity9 said from the @entity10 on monday			1
" the problem has been that the website that 's supposed to make it easy to apply for and purchase the insurance is not working the way it should for everybody			1
" what 's not working error messages : @entity22 is plagued with technical problems			1
the @entity9 administration has n't completely released the cause or extent of the problems , likely because they have n't quite figured them out			1
but people in all but 14 states and the @entity31 are having trouble applying for the exchanges because the website is n't allowing them to complete the process			2
" i put in my user name and password , it did n't recognize it , " @entity37 's senior medical correspondent @entity36 reported monday , saying that the website gave her error messages or said " page not found " or that the system was down			1
@entity45 open enrollment : here 's everything you need to know the problems appear to have been worse for those who signed up in the first days the exchanges opened			1
spinning icon : for others , the website is extremely slow			0
the spinning icon that indicates that the website is working , albeit slowly , is a huge frustration in the age of ( relatively ) fast connection speeds			0
faulty information : it 's not only consumers wanting to sign up for health insurance who are having trouble , but the insurance companies that provide coverage are experiencing difficulties with the exchanges , too			1
insurance companies say the technical problems are causing the companies to receive both incomplete customer information and duplicate applications			2
internet overload : the @entity75 indicated that the problems are exacerbated because of the large number of people who have visited @entity22			1
@entity9 said 20 million have visited the site since the exchanges opened on october 1			2
while the president said he would not excuse the problem , he said half a million people have managed to apply			0
but it is unclear how many of them have made it all the way through the sign up process			0
while that 's a large number , it 's only a fraction of the 48 million uninsured and 20 million who have visited @entity22			0
still , as some have been able to sign up , it 's not all bad : have you had trouble signing up ? tell us your experience what 's working state - run exchanges : fourteen states and the @entity31 are running their own exchanges			1
those websites are working much better			0
many of the states refused to implement their own exchanges in large part because of ideological opposition to the health care law , forcing the federal government to fill the void			0
1 - 800 - 318 - 2596 : that 's the number to call if you want to sign up for health insurance by phone ; by speaking to an actual person			2
@entity9 said wait times are " less than a minute			2
" @entity36 confirmed that receiving help via phone was a cinch			0
they 're very helpful and they answer almost instantly , " she said of the call operators			0
5 things that have happened since @entity45 launched @entity128 : recent polls suggest that the majority of people do n't know much about the @entity45			2
a nonprofit set up to help people sign up for @entity134 , @entity135 , said they are seeing changes			0
@entity137 , spokesman for @entity138 , said they have nearly doubled the number , from 4,000 to 7,000 , working to educate the uninsured about the exchanges and health insurance			0
information : before the exchanges opened , the cost and services provided were largely unknown			2
but both @entity22 and the state - run exchange websites are providing detailed information about what people will get and how much it will cost			1
time : while the exchanges opened on october 1 , coverage does n't begin until january 1 , and the deadline for having coverage in place is march 1 , so there 's still time to sign up			0
officials are recommending people who need to sign up do so by february 15 to ensure the coverage will take effect in time .			0
