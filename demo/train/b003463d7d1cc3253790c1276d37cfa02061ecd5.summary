@entity0 left @entity1 for the @entity2 , by official accounts , a healthy man			1
but within days after his arrival in @entity7 , things changed for him , for the worst			0
so who is @entity0 , besides the first person to be diagnosed with @entity10 in the @entity2 ? when did he start to feel sick , and what happened to him next ? and who did he come in contact with , in the meantime ? your # @entity16 questions answered who is @entity0 ? he is a 42 - year - old @entity19 citizen , said a friend who knows him well but asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of his case			1
@entity0 's @entity24 page indicates that he 's from the @entity19 capital of @entity26 , where he attended @entity28 @entity27			1
why did he come to the @entity2 ? to visit family and friends , according to the friend , who noted this was @entity0 's first trip to @entity2			1
@entity34 director @entity33 has said that @entity0 was " staying with family members who live in this country			2
" @entity0 was visiting his son and his son 's mother in @entity40 , according to @entity41 , @entity0 's half - brother			1
when did @entity0 leave @entity19 ? he departed the @entity43 nation on september 19 , @entity33 says			1
how did he get @entity10 ? authorities have n't said			2
witnesses say @entity0 had been helping @entity10 patients in @entity19			1
@entity19 community leader @entity47 said @entity0 was caring for an ebola - infected patient at a residence in @entity50 , just outside @entity26			1
the @entity51 reported thursday that @entity0 had direct contact with a pregnant woman stricken with @entity10 on september 15 , days before he left for the @entity2			1
citing the woman 's parents and @entity0 's neighbors in @entity26 , @entity19 , the newspaper said @entity0 had helped carry the ailing woman home after a hospital turned her away because there was n't enough space in its @entity10 treatment ward			1
a @entity34 spokesman told @entity65 on wednesday that he had n't seen the newspaper 's report and could n't comment			0
was he screened for @entity10 before getting on the plane ? yes , according to @entity69 , board chairman of the @entity70			2
" the first screening was at the gate , before you get to the parking lot			0
the second time is before you enter the terminal building and the third is before you board the flight			0
at every point your temperature is scanned			0
" his temperature at those checkpoints was a consistent 97.3 degrees @entity82 , @entity34 chief @entity33 told reporters thursday			0
on a health screening questionnaire , @entity0 answered " no " to questions about whether he had cared for a patient with the deadly virus and whether he had touched the body of someone who died in an area affected by the disease , @entity69 said			1
complete coverage on @entity10 so where did he go next ? authorities believe he was on two @entity96 flights -- flight 951 from @entity98 to @entity99 and @entity100 from @entity99 to @entity101 -- during his trip , according to a spokesperson for the airline who did not want to be named			1
passengers on those flights are not in danger , the spokesperson said			2
the airline is voluntarily reaching out to passengers on those flights , an airline source said			1
when did his @entity10 symptoms appear ? " four or five days " after his trip , according to the @entity34 's @entity33			1
this does n't mean that @entity0 actually got infected with @entity10 in the @entity2			1
the incubation period for the virus is two to 21 days , meaning that a person could be infected with the disease for up to three weeks before he or she show any signs of it			2
when he did seek medical help ? after 10 p.m. thursday , september 25			0
that 's when @entity0 first walked into @entity122 , according to a statement wednesday			2
( a hospital official had earlier said that he 'd gone to the hospital friday			0
) his friend said that @entity0 had a fever and vomiting during this first visit to the @entity40 hospital			1
the hospital , in a statement wednesday , said he had a " low grade fever and abdominal pain			2
" he underwent basic blood tests but was n't screened for @entity10 , said dr. @entity136 from the @entity40 hospital			1
@entity0 left the medical facility after being given antibiotics and a pain reliever , his friend said			2
" his condition did not warrant admission , " the hospital said			0
" he also was not exhibiting symptoms specific to @entity10			2
" were flags raised that @entity0 might have @entity10 ? after being asked by a nurse , @entity0 did say that he 'd traveled from @entity1 , said dr. @entity146 , executive vice president of @entity122 's parent company			1
but that detail -- which might have raised an alarm that @entity0 might have @entity10 , since @entity19 is one of the countries hardest hit by the virus -- was not " fully communicated " to the medical team , according to @entity146			1
when was he admitted to @entity122 ? on sunday			0
the friend -- frustrated and feeling hospital staff was n't doing enough -- then reportedly called the @entity34 about @entity0 's case			1
the @entity34 told the friend to call @entity7 ' @entity158 , with the message eventually getting to the hospital			0
this description , however , runs counter to what @entity122 said in its statement wednesday			0
by the time @entity0 arrived via ambulance , " @entity165 had already identified potential need for isolation , " the hospital said			1
" the hospital followed all suggested @entity34 protocols at that time			0
" who did the patient come into contact with in the meantime ? given the timetable outlined by @entity33 , that leaves a few days between when @entity0 began to show signs of @entity10 and when he was hospitalized			1
this is significant because someone with @entity10 is only contagious when they are symptomatic			2
and , obviously , there are more safeguards to prevent infection in a medical environment than outside of it			0
health officials are reaching out to as many as 100 people who may have had contact with @entity0 , a spokeswoman with the @entity191 said thursday			2
these are people who are still being questioned because they may have crossed paths with the patient either at the hospital , at his apartment complex or in the community			0
" out of an abundance of caution , we 're starting with this very wide net , including people who have had even brief encounters with the patient or the patient 's home , " spokeswoman @entity197 said			0
" the number will drop as we focus in on those whose contact may represent a potential risk of infection			0
" the number of direct contacts who have been identified and are being monitored right now is " more than 12 , " a federal official told @entity65 on thursday			0
" by the end of the day , we should have a pretty good idea of how many contacts there are , " the official said			0
that number includes five students who attended four different schools in the area , according to @entity40 superintendent @entity224			0
three students were also pulled from an elementary school in the @entity227 on thursday after health officials determined they may have been in contact with @entity0			0
they have no symptoms , but " have been removed from school in order to be monitored , " the school district said			0
it 's not known yet whether they or anyone else got @entity10 , which only spreads through contact with infected bodily fluids , because of @entity0			1
this includes members of the ambulance crew that transported him to the hospital ; none of had shown symptoms , @entity40 mayor @entity243 said tuesday			2
how is @entity0 doing ? " all right , " according to his friend , who has spoken with @entity0 frequently			0
" he is in pain			0
" the friend , who talked with @entity0 as recently as wednesday afternoon , said that @entity0 has n't eaten in a week			0
@entity122 spokeswoman @entity251 said that @entity0 is in serious condition at her @entity40 hospital .			1
