-- one of the most surprising moments of this year 's @entity2 came at the very end , when first lady @entity4 showed up on video to help announce the best picture winner			1
if you 're anything like us , you immediately wondered what the significance could be , especially since she was announcing the award from the @entity13			0
but when you think about it , having @entity4 help draw the @entity2 ceremony to a close was a fitting way to end this politically saturated awards season			1
the real - life drama of @entity22 politics can be absorbing enough on its own , but mix in @entity24 machinations and you could create a must - see movie			1
political themes have been popular at the @entity2 in the past , but this year 's list of best picture contenders was rife with them			1
there was " @entity32 , " which was nominated in a number of big categories on sunday and ended up in a tie for the best sound editing @entity2			1
regardless of its lack of statues , @entity38 's project remains one of the most talked - about movies of 2012 thanks to its plot centered on the hunt for @entity47			0
the script , written by @entity49 , lit the match for fiery debates on torture			0
@entity56 's " @entity55 , " a recounting of how the 16th president brought the @entity59 to an end and passed the 13th amendment , was a giant in the walk - up to the @entity2			2
@entity63 ' portrayal of @entity55 won him the best actor @entity2 , and @entity63 was sure to thank the man who inspired his role			2
( his beard in the film , by the way , was real			0
) and of course there was " @entity72 , " the year 's best picture winner , which followed a secret @entity76 operation to rescue six @entity78 diplomats during the @entity80 hostage crisis in 1980			1
the film was not only a critical success , but it was thought - provoking , too			0
since its release last fall , its historical accuracy has been called into question and its depiction of @entity90 's term has been picked apart			0
( the @entity91 ' ran a cartoon of a shocked @entity93 after the @entity2 ceremony			2
" @entity72 ? ! " the cartoon read			2
" you mean i lost to the @entity90 administration ? ! " ) that 's not to mention " @entity72 's " international reach , as it sparked criticism from @entity80 authorities			0
we know @entity24 's version of politics well -- which celebrity said what , when , and to whom -- but it seems this awards season shifted our focus somewhat to grander themes			1
these " best picture contenders , " wrote @entity0 contributor @entity112 , " have managed to pay off at the box office even as they brought politics and history to the big screen -- proof that we 'll take smart over stupid as long as we 're entertained while educated			0
