-- in the physical world , @entity2 founder @entity1 is a wanted man			2
in the virtual world , his website is under attack and on the run			0
there is n't much question that the person who obtained the @entity2 cables from a classified @entity13 government network broke @entity13 law and should expect to face the consequences			1
the legal rights of a website that publishes material acquired from that person , however , are much more controversial			0
there are many prominent @entity13 -- and a great many ordinary @entity13 -- who have made their views clear over the past week that @entity2 ' " cablegate " website should not be considered constitutionally protected speech			2
others , however , believe equally strongly that now that the material is out , news media and website owners have the right to publish the material			2
what is troubling and dangerous is that in the internet age , public discourse increasingly depends on digital spaces created , owned and operated by private companies			1
the result is that one politician has more power than ever to shut down controversial speech unilaterally with one phone call			0
after suffering aggressive cyber attacks last weekend , @entity1 removed his " cablegate " site from servers in @entity42 and purchased a new home for it on @entity46 's web hosting service			2
on tuesday , @entity46 talked on the phone with the office of sen. @entity49 , chairman of the @entity51 's committee on homeland security			1
shortly thereafter , @entity46 booted @entity2			1
the senator responded with a statement : " i wish that @entity46 had taken this action earlier based on @entity2 ' previous publication of classified material			1
the company 's decision to cut off @entity2 now is the right decision and should set the standard for other companies @entity2 is using to distribute its illegally seized material			1
" this is not the first time @entity49 has demanded that an @entity13 internet company take down controversial material			2
last time , the outcome was different			0
in 2008 , @entity49 wrote to @entity69 ceo @entity68 , demanding immediate removal of " content produced by @entity73 terrorist organizations from @entity74			2
" while @entity74 did remove a few videos that violated community guidelines against violence and hate speech , it refused to remove most of them			0
@entity69 's lawyers determined that the material @entity49 wanted removed , while upsetting to many @entity13 , was clearly protected under the @entity83			2
" while we respect and understand [ @entity49 's ] views , @entity74 encourages free speech and defends everyone 's right to express unpopular points of view , " @entity68 wrote in his response			1
he continued : " we believe @entity74 is a richer and more relevant platform for users precisely because it hosts a diverse range of views , and rather than stifle debate , we allow our users to view all acceptable content and make up their own minds			0
" the @entity105 editorial page chimed in : " while it is fortunate that mr. @entity49 does not have the power to tell @entity74 that it must remove videos , it is profoundly disturbing that an influential senator would even consider telling a media company to shut down constitutionally protected speech			1
" @entity46 's dumping of @entity2 at one senator 's request brings into stark relief one of the core problems @entity13 have grappled with since before our country even existed : where is the right balance between security , on one hand , and civil liberties , on the other ? we have always disagreed passionately			1
much of @entity13 politics and a large number of constitutional battles center on this question			0
one might even argue that our political and legal systems are designed to enable this argument to continue indefinitely as new technologies and challenges arise			0
but the @entity2 @entity46 case also highlights a new problem for @entity13 democracy -- and ultimately for the future of freedom and democracy more globally			1
a substantial if not critical amount of our political discourse has moved into the digital realm			0
this realm is largely made up of virtual spaces that are created , owned and operated by the private sector			1
as far as the law is concerned , @entity46 is off the hook			0
speech within the kingdom of @entity146 -- run by its sovereign @entity147 and his board of directors with help from the wise counsel and judgment of the company 's executives -- is not protected in the same way that speech is constitutionally protected in @entity13 's public spaces			2
the law gives @entity46 the right to set its own rules			0
the company 's terms of service clearly state that it " reserves the right to refuse service , terminate accounts , remove or edit content in its sole discretion			0
" by clicking " agree , " the customer has legally consented to " represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the content , " and that said content " will not cause injury to any person or entity			0
" given that citizens are increasingly dependent on privately owned spaces for our politics and public discourse , however , the fight over how speech should be governed in a democracy is focused increasingly on questions of how private companies should or should n't control speech conducted on and across their networks and platforms			1
we are facing new questions on which @entity13 have no clear consensus , and which were not covered in civics class : how will decisions made by private internet and telecommunications companies about what content they will or wo n't allow affect the ability of citizens to carry out informed debate on important matters of public concern ? what are the private sector 's obligations and responsibilities to prevent the erosion of democracy ? while @entity46 was within its legal rights , the company has nonetheless sent a clear signal to its users : if you engage in controversial speech that some individual members of the @entity13 government do n't like -- even if there is a strong case to be made that your speech is constitutionally protected -- @entity46 is going to dump you at the first sign of trouble			1
let 's hope that there will always be other companies willing to stand up for our rights as enshrined both in the @entity224 and in the @entity225 -- and by extension their right to do business with us			0
the future of freedom in the internet age may well depend on whether we the people can succeed in holding companies that now act as arbiters of the public discourse accountable to the public interest			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity241 .			0

@entity241 says many differ on whether media should publish @entity2 cables
what 's troubling , she says , is that sen. @entity49 can get @entity46 to dump it from server
she asks : what are private sector 's responsibilities to prevent erosion of free speech ?
