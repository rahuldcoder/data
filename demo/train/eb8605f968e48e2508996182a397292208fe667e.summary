@entity2 demonstrators wheeled out the looming figure under cover of darkness			1
the sculptor , a 22 - year - old artist who calls himself " milk , " had yet to title his creation			2
but passersby were quick to nickname the mannequin " umbrella man			1
" built of wooden squares , the 10 - foot tall statue of a man holding aloft a yellow umbrella has now taken its place alongside the posters , cartoons , banners and calligraphy that now decorate the streets and sidewalks of @entity2 's @entity27 district			1
since they occupied this area a week and a half ago , pro-democracy protesters have transformed a stretch of concrete highway running through the center of the city into an improvised outdoor gallery of politically - inspired art. " it 's an outpouring of creative talent , " exclaimed @entity36 , a @entity2 - based designer and entrepreneur , during a recent visit to the protest encampment			1
" why have n't we seen this before ? " asked @entity36 , who also took care to point out that he was not an active supporter of the protest movement			2
umbrella inspiration the sit - in has acted as a magnet attracting artists eager to make their voices heard			1
the artist known as @entity53 told @entity1 his statue was inspired by the image of a protester holding an umbrella to shield a police officer from the rain			1
most of the other images displayed here also riff on the umbrella and the yellow ribbon , two symbols of the protest movement			1
last month , protesters used umbrellas -- an accessory @entity69 carry to protect themselves from torrential downpours as well as tropical sun -- to shield themselves from pepper spray fired by police			0
less than 48 hours into the occupation , demonstrators erected a globe - shaped monument out of umbrellas above the traffic circle next to the @entity81 building			2
since then , the streets and sidewalks have been plastered with cartoon - like characters holdings umbrellas , accompanied by slogans calling for democracy , freedom and justice			2
one of the posters shows a helmeted police officer with riot shield yelling " you 're such a thug ! " while pointing his finger at an umbrella - toting cartoon that resembles the children 's book character @entity96			1
the artist who drew the cartoon is a 30 - year - old graphic designer @entity99			0
" my initial idea was to make people laugh in this heavy atmosphere , " @entity101 told @entity1			0
@entity101 , who described herself as a political neophyte , said she was inspired to produce a series of protest - inspired drawings after seeing reports of police clashing with protesters on september 28th			1
" at the moment i saw the tear gas , it made me want to support the students , " @entity101 said			0
art as ' silent protest ' on a recent afternoon , art teacher @entity118 sat in the middle of the highway now occupied by students , painting yellow ribbons onto @entity124 paper			1
she hoped her posters would prove more durable than previous slogans she had made , which were washed away by rainstorms last week			0
" we can use different media to express ourselves ... to tell people what we feel about @entity2 , " @entity129 said			1
" i like the peaceful and silent protest and i 'm supporting the students behind the scenes			0
" not far away , 17 - year - old @entity137 was designing his own posters on the asphalt with the slogan " @entity142 no listen to @entity143 ? " " i want to use my way to show my voice to the public , " the teenager said			1
post-it politics like many others here , @entity149 said his favorite piece of art at the protest site was actually a colorful piece of work created by thousands of contributors named the " @entity158			1
" thousands of pastel post-it notes bearing messages and drawings written by passersby in many languages coat the curved staircase that runs along the outside wall of one of the government office buildings in @entity27			0
many of the messages profess love for @entity2			2
the wall serves as proof that , despite young @entity69 ' freedom to digitally post anything they like on social media , there is still a powerful attraction to expressing oneself using old - fashioned paper and ink			0
" this feels very much to me like @entity183 , but paper @entity183 , " observed @entity36 , the businessman and art aficionado			0
" @entity183 , if there 's such a thing			0
" @entity36 , who runs a chain of high - end design stores called @entity189 , was quickly inspired to add his own post-it message to the wall			2
it was an appeal to @entity2 's beleaguered top official to preserve the post-it monument : " mr. chief executive , please do n't tear this wall down			2
" " i see a lot of tenderness , a lot of passion ... a lot of imagination , which is fantastic , " @entity36 said , while gazing out on the largely empty encampment and its fluttering banners and posters			0
" i wonder where that 's from ? " he asked			0
" i wonder where these people will be after this , when it all ends			0
" @entity210 and @entity211 contributed to this report .			0
