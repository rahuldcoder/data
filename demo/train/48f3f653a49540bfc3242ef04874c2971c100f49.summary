-- it was strange -- and strangely creepy -- to discover that the former @entity3 cop accused of murder has so many opinions about cable pundits and anchors			1
the 11 - page manifesto from @entity9 is filled with dark and disturbing thoughts , and his comments about television provide a macabre form of comic relief			1
what was equally troubling , at least to me , was an explosion of conservative comments on @entity19 trying to tie his alleged rampage to ... liberals			1
that 's right , even with three people dead , one wounded and a manhunt under way , the ugly game of ideological finger - pointing was under way			1
" this is very telling that you 've got a direct association of liberal luminaries with this killer , " @entity30 , president of the conservative @entity31 , told @entity33 's @entity32			1
actually , it 's not telling at all			1
at least @entity30 added that the luminaries should not be held responsible for @entity9 's actions just because his screed invoked their names			1
watch : should we care that @entity9 likes liberal pundits ? @entity9 seems all over the map			1
he wants @entity45 to be president , but calls @entity46 his second choice and praises @entity48 and @entity49			0
some of the television figures he hailed clearly lean left , others are hard - news anchors and reporters			2
one -- " @entity56 " host @entity55 -- is a former @entity57 congressman			0
" @entity59 , @entity55 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 , keep up the great work and follow @entity69 's lead , " the manifesto says			1
and it offers advice : " @entity73 , you 're a talented and charismatic journalist			0
stop with all the talk show shenanigans and get back to your core of reporting			0
" watch : did @entity46 bully the doctor who dissed him on tv ? at @entity0 , @entity9 loves @entity79 but wants @entity80 deported			2
he mailed @entity66 a dvd related to his termination from the @entity84 police force and a coin with three bullet holes			0
the idea that we should take the detritus of this diseased mind seriously is ludicrous			0
after i tweeted a link to a colleague 's @entity94 story about the manifesto , i asked whether we should care what @entity9 writes			1
some on the right went haywire			0
" would you care if he loved @entity103 , @entity32 and @entity104 ? " one @entity19 user asked			0
" my guess is you would , hypocrite			0
" and : " entire @entity108 would feed on this if it were linked to any right - wing cause			2
" oh , and someone said i was " a sick , twisted freak and a liar " for saying that @entity112 , the former @entity57 congressman turned @entity115 host , is a conservative			0
watch : should @entity118 have banned revealing outfits at the @entity120 ? some blatantly promoted the notion of payback : " you guys smeared @entity125 over @entity126			1
now it 's your turn to be linked to a murderous madman			2
only this time the link 's legit			2
" in other words , if @entity9 admired some liberal media figures , they 're somehow to blame for inspiring the murders			2
now it 's true that some on the left tried to tar @entity125 when @entity138 opened fire in a @entity141 shopping center , killing six people and wounding @entity143			1
@entity125 's team had posted a map with crosshair targets representing @entity148 lawmakers , including @entity143 , that she was singling out for defeat in the 2010 midterms			1
on the day of the shooting , i wrote on @entity153 : " this is n't about a nearly year - old @entity125 map ; it 's about a lone nutjob who does n't value human life			1
" the use of the crosshairs imagery was dumb , i said , but there was no place for a " sickening ritual of guilt by association			0
" and the same goes for the case o @entity167			0
the man is accused of killing a police officer and a couple in a parking lot			2
what possible difference does it make which journalists and politicians he likes or loathes ? the @entity143 shooting sparked an important discussion about the need to tone down incendiary rhetoric , but that 's a far cry from accusing people of complicity in crime			1
watch : does @entity182 have a $ 5 million case against @entity184 ? there is also the question of whether the manifesto should have been published			2
in 1995 , i covered the controversy when the @entity191 and the @entity192 , where i then worked , published another manifesto , this one a 35,000 - word ramble by the mass murderer known as the @entity195			1
his real name was @entity198 , and he threatened to keep on killing unless the papers acquiesced			0
the publication prompted @entity198 's brother to tell the @entity202 of his suspicions			0
in the wired age , there was no question that @entity9 's words would instantly ricochet around the world			0
no newspaper publisher can act as a gatekeeper ; the @entity211 serves as a platform even for the poisonous words of alleged killers			0
but that does n't mean we should take those words and use them to rope in public figures who have the misfortune of being named			0
killers are responsible for killing , no matter which television anchors they happen to like			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			1

an 11 - page manifesto from accused *gunman* comments on tv *personalities*
@entity227 says it 's *foolish* to pay attention to media *preferences* of the suspect
he says some see the situation as payback for criticism of @entity125 after @entity143 shooting
@entity227 : what difference does it make which politicians , pundits the suspect admires ?
