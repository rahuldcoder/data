-- when @entity2 sat down with his two little girls for a simple project they could work on together , he did n't realize they 'd hit upon a solution to one of the world 's biggest problems for just $ 5 : a solar - powered oven			1
inventor @entity2 with the oven he has made out of a cardboard box			1
the ingeniously simple design uses two cardboard boxes , one inside the other , and an acrylic cover that lets in the sun 's rays and traps them			1
black paint on the inner box , and silver foil on the outer one , help concentrate the heat			0
the trapped rays make the inside hot enough to cook casseroles , bake bread and boil water			2
what the box also does is eliminate the need in developing countries for rural residents to cut down trees for firewood			0
about 3 billion people around the world do so , adding to deforestation and , in turn , global warming			0
by allowing users to boil water , the simple device could also potentially save the millions of children who die from drinking unclean water			0
@entity2 's invention on thursday won the @entity47 , which sought to find and publicize the most innovative and practical solution to climate change			1
" a lot of scientists are working on ways to send people to @entity54			0
i was looking for something a little more grassroots , a little simpler , " @entity2 said thursday			1
@entity2 's contest win notwithstanding , solar cooking with a cardboard oven is n't new			1
two @entity61 women , @entity62 and @entity63 , were the solar box cooker 's first serious promoters in the 1970s			2
they and others joined forces to create the non-profit @entity68 -- originally called @entity69 -- in 1987			0
further , the organization 's executive director , @entity70 , said that the plans for a solar box cooker were found in a book published by the @entity75 in the 1960s			2
" we are pleased that mr. @entity2 has taken up the cause and interest of the 95 member organizations and 160 individuals of the @entity82 , " @entity70 said			1
" it would be a pleasure to work with mr. @entity2 in @entity85 where we have been promoting the use of solar cookers for ten years			1
" @entity2 , a @entity88 - born entrepreneur based in @entity85 , said he also had been looking at solutions " way too complex , for way too long			1
" " this took me about a weekend , and it worked on the first try , " @entity2 said			1
" it 's mind - boggling how simple it is			2
" the contest was organized by the @entity98 -- a sustainable development charity -- and the @entity101 newspaper			0
among the judges were @entity104 business magnate @entity103 and environmentalist @entity105			0
the public also voted on the finalists			0
@entity2 's invention beat about 300 other entries , including a machine that turns wood and other organic material into charcoal , wheel covers that make trucks more fuel efficient by reducing drag , and a feed supplement for livestock that reduces the methane they emit by 15 percent			1
@entity2 named his invention the @entity123 , after the international environmental treaty to reduce global warming			2
the box can be produced in existing cardboard factories			2
it has gone into production in a factory in @entity131 , @entity85 , that can churn out about 2.5 million boxes a month			1
@entity2 has also designed a more durable version , made from recycled plastic , which can be produced just as cheaply			1
he envisions such cardboard ovens being distributed throughout rural @entity137			2
" in the @entity139 , we cook with electricity , so it 's easy to ignore this problem , " he said			0
" but half the world 's population is still living in a stone age			0
the only way for them to cook is to make a fire			0
" i do n't want to see another 80 - year - old woman carrying 20 kilos of firewood on her back			0
maybe we do n't have to			0
