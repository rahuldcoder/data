-- ever since an 18 - foot chunk of fuselage ripped off an @entity5 @entity4 in mid-flight , aircraft metal fatigue has been a worry in the aviation industry			1
a flight attendant died and eight passengers were injured in the incident , which occurred in april of 1988			0
to address the problem of aging aircraft , the @entity12 says it has issued numerous regulations and 100 airworthiness directives			1
but on friday the agency announced a rule to end the ad hoc approach to a critical issue of aviation safety			1
the final rule to prevent " widespread fatigue damage " requires aircraft makers and airlines to establish the number of takeoff - and - landing cycles or the number of hours a plane can operate without risk of fatigue damage			1
after the limit is established the rule will prevent airlines from flying the aircraft past that point unless they receive an extension			1
" safety is our highest priority			0
this rule provides a comprehensive approach to the problem of widespread fatigue in aging aircraft , " said transportation secretary @entity40			1
" requiring carriers to regularly inspect their aircraft for possible fatigue is essential to ensuring the highest levels of safety			2
" in june of 2002 , three airborne firefighters over @entity52 were killed when their plane collapsed due to fatigue cracks in the wing structure			2
a similar accident killed two firefighters in @entity58 the very next month			0
more recently , two @entity60 @entity59 suffered serious fatigue cracks last year			2
one caused an 18 - inch by 12 - inch gap in the fuselage that depressurized the airplane and another led to the loss of a wheel - and - brake assembly during landing			0
there were no serious injuries in either event			0
every flight of an airplane puts some stress on its structure			0
after numerous flights fatigue can trigger cracks , which can expand and connect			2
" widespread fatigue damage is increasingly likely as the airplane ages , and is certain if the airplane is operated long enough , " said the @entity12 in its summary of the new rule			1
" existing inspection methods do not reliably detect @entity82 because cracks are initially so small and may then link up and grow so rapidly that the affected structure fails before an inspection can be performed to detect the cracks			1
" " this is definitely a good thing they 're doing this , " said @entity85 , chairman of the @entity86 at @entity87			0
" it 's not uncommon as an airplane ages that you 'll find those things			0
" @entity95 had argued " the rule was not justified in terms of safety , " according to the @entity12 's summary of industry discussion of the rule			1
aircraft manufacturer @entity4 supported the rule			2
" we already have some very good plans that are approved by the @entity12 that address this issue , " said @entity95 spokesman @entity103			0
@entity107 says its fleet , on average , is 14.5 years old and getting younger as it receives delivery of new @entity112 and retires old @entity114 80s			0
the average age of @entity117 's fleet also is 14.5 years while @entity118 's is 14.3 years , according to the website airfleets.net , which tracks airline fleets worldwide			0
the @entity12 is giving airlines and manufacturers up to 60 months to come up with time - in - service limits .			1

the new rule is designed to end the ad hoc approach to aircraft metal fatigue
aircraft makers and airlines will have to determine plane safety limits
cracks in airplane metal are small but can link up and grow rapidly , the @entity12 says
