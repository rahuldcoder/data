@entity0 -- @entity2 on wednesday announced plans to redefine television as a medium that viewers can control by waving their hands and talking rather than clicking on remotes			1
in a speech to open the @entity19 in @entity0 , company ceo @entity16 also said he aims to make tv more social -- letting viewers chat with each other as avatars in virtual settings and place live bets on sporting events from the tv screen			1
perhaps it 's time to say goodbye to the old - fashioned couch potato			0
at the center of this new vision for the living room is the @entity26 , @entity2 's internet - connected gaming system that , thanks to an add - on called @entity30 , can read and interpret players ' motions			1
" your xbox is becoming the hub of your living room , " he said			0
" it is your gaming system			0
it is your tv experience			0
" @entity16 announced an update to that system that lets @entity30 's cameras read facial expressions and mouth movements in addition to what their arms and legs are doing			1
called " @entity30 , " this new feature , which is due out in the spring , will allow friends to meet up as avatars -- or video - game likenesses of themselves -- in virtual settings			1
a demo of this feature showed avatars chatting at a virtual - world tailgate while sitting in digital , plaid lawn chairs			1
in another demo , female avatars got together on a neon set , as if they were collaborating on an online talk show			0
@entity30 's cameras watch the friends from the top of their tvs and translates their facial expressions into the digital hangout			1
" as you can see now @entity30 can track features like your smile , your laugh and even the raise of your eyebrows , " @entity16 said , offering a demo of himself as a bald avatar -- his digital eyebrows bouncing up and down			1
@entity16 described these virtual meet - ups as a " new way to socialize			2
" but , even during his speech , some @entity85 users wrote they found that idea downright creepy			1
" this seems unhealthy , " one @entity85 user wrote			1
" will it also track @entity91 ? or false eyelashes ? what about coloured contact lens ? " wrote another			0
others wrote that they 're fine with @entity97 devices controlling their living room electronics experience			0
" @entity103 , my @entity102 is the hub of my living room , " one @ cnntech @entity85 follower wrote , referencing the @entity101 gaming system			1
the @entity30 feature is available only to people who pay a subscription fee for an @entity109 membership , which costs about $ 60 per year			2
even without the avatars , @entity110 is getting more social as it brings elements of the internet into the living room , @entity16 said			1
@entity2 announced a partnership with @entity116 , for instance , that lets people watch the @entity121 college football championship game over @entity109			1
viewers can chat with friends on the tv screen during the game and place non-monetary bets about who they think will win			0
they can see how their predictions stack up against that of their friends and the @entity109 community at large			0
football fans would be ranked according to success , allowing sports fans to " earn their bragging rights , " said @entity137 , from @entity2 's interactive entertainment division			2
" now i can make my picks and trash talk as i 'm watching the game , " he said			0
" not on e-mail , not over text -- right in my living room on the tv			0
" this trend of internet - enabled , or " connected " tv is set to be a major theme of this year 's @entity19 , where tv makers from @entity149 to @entity101 are announcing app stores and other features that are designed to bring social media and web experiences to tv			2
some of these companies work internet features directly into the television instead of requiring a separate gadget , as is the case with @entity2 's @entity159			2
others , like the @entity162 app for the @entity163 , aim to let another device provide a social experience that can supplement live tv viewing			2
the idea of internet tv has been tried many times before but has never gone fully mainstream			2
but @entity2 's internet - tv system does do one thing other do n't -- full - body motion control			1
the company highlighted this point repeatedly , announcing partnerships , for instance , with @entity174 and @entity175 that let @entity181 users control those video apps by waiving their hands and talking to the system to select and play movies			0
it 's a " new world of controller - free entertainment that you can not find anywhere else , " @entity137 said			0
the company said it had sold 8 million @entity192 in 60 days , beating its goal of selling 5 million during that timeframe			0
the keynote address also highlighted other @entity2 efforts , including @entity197 and the @entity199 operating system , which is in the process of being upgraded to work on a range of devices , including buzz - worthy tablet computers			2
@entity2 is widely criticized as being behind the curve on developing an operating system for tablets			2
the company promised an update to its mobile @entity197 operating system that will add copy - paste functionality and the ability to switch between apps more quickly			0
those features are already available from the two hottest smartphone ecosystems : the @entity216 and @entity217 @entity215			0
some bloggers and wrote that @entity2 hid its skeletons in the closet during the speech -- straying from tablets and smartphones , which are big topics with other companies			1
but @entity16 said @entity2 is looking to the future -- and that will include all tech platforms , not just personal computers			1
the company aims to " redefine what is really possible " with technology , he said .			0
