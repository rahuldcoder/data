-- november has recently transformed into " @entity1 , " the month for growing mustaches to raise money for fighting prostate cancer			1
now , for those who are n't interested in the shaggy look -- or who might be " follicly " challenged -- there 's another way to help another good cause : by cutting your locks			0
the @entity13 is sponsoring the @entity14 , a fund - raising effort that it says started when the @entity17 ' @entity16 offered to cut his famous hair -- for the first time in a decade -- to help veterans			1
" my hair gets a lot of attention , and by cutting it after more than ten years , it is my hope that i can help bring to light the fate of our country 's veterans , " the @entity22 safety said on his @entity13 donation page			1
@entity16 , 32 , will get his long locks trimmed on monday , @entity34 , in front of a crowd at @entity17 's @entity37 , although it 's unclear how much he 'll actually get cut			1
