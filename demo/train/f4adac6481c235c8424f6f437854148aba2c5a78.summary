shortly after being given more time to weigh evidence in black teenager @entity4 's fatal shooting , a @entity1 grand jury heard from the man at the center of it -- @entity8 police officer @entity8 -- a local newspaper reported			1
@entity8 shot and killed the 19 - year - old @entity4 in the middle of the day on august 9 , in the middle of a street in the @entity14 suburb			1
authorities could have charged @entity8 themselves by filing a criminal complaint , but @entity19 prosecuting attorney @entity18 instead opted to present the case to a grand jury that could indict the officer , or not			1
on wednesday , @entity8 testified for almost four hours in front of the seven men and five women on that grand jury , according to the @entity27 , citing a source with knowledge of the investigation			1
the same source cited by the paper claimed that the @entity8 police officer , who was put on paid administrative leave after the shooting , has been " cooperative " in his two conversations with @entity19 investigators and one with federal investigators			1
in addition to the county 's case , the @entity39 has launched its own civil rights investigation into the shooting			0
unlike many other aspects of the legal system , grand jury proceedings are closed to the public			0
their mission is not to decide -- unanimously -- if there 's evidence beyond a reasonable doubt to convict someone on a charge , as is the case with a criminal jury			0
rather in @entity1 , nine grand jurors -- or three - fourths of the total -- have to agree there is sufficient probable cause to charge someone with a crime			0
how the grand jury works the fact that grand jury proceedings are secret has irked @entity4 's camp , many of whom accuse @entity18 of being too cozy with law enforcement			2
they question his commitment to pressing a case against @entity8 , who is white , for the shooting of a young @entity77 - @entity76 man			0
the late teen 's supporters have demanded @entity8 be charged , accusing him of shooting the unarmed @entity4 when his hands were up			1
meanwhile , @entity8 's backers -- including a radio caller identifying herself as @entity84 , who recounted his purported version of events -- claimed that the officer only fired after the larger @entity4 struggled with , taunted and then ran at him			2
there was no guarantee that @entity8 would get the chance to tell a grand jury his side of the story			2
the defense does n't present a case in these proceedings , which are run by prosecutors			0
" usually an accused will not be invited to testify , " @entity98 , a criminal defense lawyer and general counsel for the @entity14 police officer association , told @entity101 in august			2
" but i would expect , in a case like this , that an invitation would be extended to him			0
" dueling narratives in @entity4 shooting so how will this all shake out ? what will the grand jury of nine whites and three african - americans decide ? will they indict @entity8 , or will they clear him ? the public may not find out anytime soon			1
on august 20 -- when mobs of protesters were still regularly hitting the streets of @entity8 demanding @entity8 's arrest and , at times , clashing with law enforcement -- @entity18 told @entity101 affiliate @entity122 that " the aspirational time is by mid-october to have everything completed			0
" and they could have more time , if they need it , than that			0
@entity14 county judge @entity129 has extended the grand jury 's deadline until january 7 , @entity132 , the county 's director of judicial administration , told @entity101 this week .			1
