-- @entity9 's " @entity8 " switched to live shows for the first time this cycle on monday night , but a chunk of viewers shrugged off the next phase of the hit reality competition series			1
" @entity8 " was down 15 percent from last week 's episode in the adult demo to mark its lowest monday performance ever ( chart below ) , yet still once again charted as the night 's top - rated show			1
" @entity8 " typically tends to dip somewhat when it moves away from the spinny - chairs audition rounds			2
at least the show provided some high - wire drama when a @entity21 contestant endured a live tv microphone fail			0
@entity0 : full coverage of ' @entity8 ' at 10 p.m. , @entity9 was surely thankful to see " @entity24 " steady with last week 's performance despite having a weaker lead - in this time and original competition from @entity29 's " @entity28			1
" speaking of , @entity29 's rival reality veteran @entity30 had lousy news , down 9 percent to post its lowest rating this cycle			2
@entity0 : ' @entity8 ' contestant @entity36 powers through mid-performance mic outage over on @entity38 , 2 " @entity41 " was down 9 percent from last week 's debut in the 8 p.m. slot			1
the network is hoping this show can be a kick - starter for the block like " @entity47 " was , but this dip is a tad worrisome ( maybe last week 's guest star @entity49 needs to be a series regular ? ... no , we do n't really believe that )			0
on the @entity51 , " @entity55 " returned from a three week break and plummeted 40 percent from its most recent original			0
the @entity51 has nothing but hard choices to make in terms of which of its bubble shows ( tomorrow , " @entity61 , " " the @entity62 , " " @entity63 " ) it renews for another season			0
the rest of the night 's shows were largely on par. see the original story at @entity0			2
