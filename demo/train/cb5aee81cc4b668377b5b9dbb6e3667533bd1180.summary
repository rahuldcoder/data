-- @entity1 is warming in line with the rest of the world , according to a new study on climate change in @entity1			1
temperatures across @entity1 have traditionally varied between east and west , scientists say			2
rather than being the last bastion to resist global warming , @entity11 research has found that for the past 50 years much of the continent of @entity1 has been getting warmer			1
for years common belief among scientists studying climate change was that a large part of @entity1 , the @entity19 , has been getting colder while the rest of the world has warmed			1
however the new research from the @entity22 has found that warming in @entity1 exceeded one - tenth of a degree @entity24 per decade for the past 50 years , which more than offsets the cooling in @entity28			1
" @entity1 is a very different place than @entity28 , and there is a physical barrier , the @entity34 , that separates the two , " said professor @entity29 , lead author of the research paper			1
the study 's findings appeared in thursday 's issue of the scientific journal nature			0
at 6,000 feet ( 1,829 meters ) above sea level the @entity40 is around 4,000 feet lower than @entity28 and subject to warm , moist storms and more snowfall			0
in gathering the data @entity29 and fellow researchers used information from satellites , which was crucial in providing new insight into patterns of temperature change across the continent			0
previous research on climate in @entity1 that relied solely on @entity56 weather stations , in place since 1957 , could not get as much information about conditions on the interior of the continent as most are placed within a short distance of the coast			1
" simple explanations do n't capture the complexity of climate , " @entity29 said			0
" the thing you hear all the time is that @entity1 is cooling and that 's not the case			2
if anything it 's the reverse , but it 's more complex than that			0
@entity1 is n't warming at the same rate everywhere , and while some areas have been cooling for a long time the evidence shows the continent as a whole is getting warmer			1
" a major reason most of @entity1 was thought to be cooling was because of a hole in the ozone layer that appears during the spring months in the @entity83 's polar region			2
@entity29 noted that it is well established that the ozone hole has contributed to cooling in @entity28			0
" however , it seems to have been assumed that the ozone hole was affecting the entire continent when there was n't any evidence to support that idea , or even any theory to support it , " he said			0
" in any case , efforts to repair the ozone layer eventually will begin taking effect and the hole could be eliminated by the middle of this century			0
if that happens , all of @entity1 could begin warming on a par with the rest of the world			2

common belief that @entity1 is getting colder *debunked* by new report
evidence that western @entity1 is warming , offsetting eastern @entity56 cooling
satellite data used to determine that @entity1 warmed in last 50 years
@entity1 is n't warming at the same rate everywhere , according to research
