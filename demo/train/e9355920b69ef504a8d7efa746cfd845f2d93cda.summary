@entity0 -- if you listen carefully , you can hear something important being debated in this election , in fact one of the most important questions of them all : what hope is there for the average @entity11 worker ? @entity14 -- in the far - off days after @entity13 -- the average worker could look forward to a steadily rising standard of living			1
you did n't have to be anyone special or do anything special			2
just keep doing your job , and over the three decades from the mid- 1940s through the mid- 1970s you could expect your wages to double			1
and that 's after inflation			2
that was a long time ago			0
even before the @entity26 , wages tended to stagnate or decline , except for the most skilled workers in the most robust industries : technology , finance , and so on			1
the middle stayed put ; the top pulled away			0
there 's little reason to expect that situation to change after recovery arrives			2
opinion : @entity38 risk being the party of mean we live in a world of global competition now , where even white - collar jobs can be outsourced to @entity45			0
if the jobs ca n't be exported , then the workers are imported , via legal or illegal immigration			1
outside the government sector , unions wield little clout -- where they exist at all			2
for those reasons and others , the wage share of the economy had already sunk to record lows as of 2007			2
what -- if anything -- should be done ? @entity59 and @entity60 each have answers , although you have to listen carefully to reconstruct them			1
here ( as i read it ) is president @entity59 's answer			1
( these are my words , except for the speech quote			0
) purely free markets wo n't be generating wage increases any time soon			1
there 's just too much low - wage competition out there			1
but we can do two things			0
as i outlined in my november 2011 speech in @entity77 , @entity78 , we can put more people to work in jobs funded by government contracts , where government can ensure high wages and benefits			1
that 's what i meant when i said , " [ m ] anufacturers and other companies are setting up shop in the places with the best infrastructure to ship their products , move their workers , communicate with the rest of the world			1
and that 's why the over 1 million construction workers who lost their jobs when the housing market collapsed , they should n't be sitting at home with nothing to do			1
they should be rebuilding our roads and our bridges , laying down faster railroads and broadband , modernizing our schools -- all the things other countries are already doing to attract good jobs and businesses to their shores			0
" yes , business , and not government , will always be the primary generator of good jobs with incomes that lift people into the middle class and keep them there			0
but as a nation , we 've always come together , through our government , to help create the conditions where both workers and businesses can succeed			1
" government contractors ca n't employ everybody , however			1
so we 'll plump up the low wages of those in the purely private economy with a growing array of wage supplements			1
we top up low pay with the @entity134			0
we 've added 14.6 million food stamp beneficiaries			0
after 2014 , we 'll be enrolling as many as 17 million additional low - wage workers in the country in @entity138			1
we 've increased subsidies for college tuition , and we subsidize heating fuel costs as well			0
vote for me , and government benefits and government employment will compensate for the wage increases the private job market does not deliver			1
@entity60 has called the president 's vision a " government - centric " one - and that seems exactly right			1
here 's the @entity60 alternative ( again these are my words , not his ) : i probably ca n't deliver rising wages for the typical worker any better than the president can			1
that 's why i hardly talk about wages at all -- they 're barely mentioned in my most important economic policy statement , the 57 - point plan i released last year			1
my concern is less with the typical worker and more with the most ambitious and most talented			0
i want to protect the " right to rise , " as my supporters in the conservative media often phrase it			0
under the president 's approach , that right will be crushed by the weight of debt and taxes -- and what 's debt , but future taxes ? instead of greater subsidies for those content to stay where they are , i offer lower taxes to those who want to better their condition			2
their hard work and innovation will yield benefits for everyone			0
ok , maybe money wages have n't risen much since 1973 for the typical worker			2
but today that worker has a safer car , a bigger house , and smarter appliances			0
he or she enjoys products and services unimagined in 1973 : personal computers , cellphones , video on demand			0
food , furniture , and vacations are all cheaper and better			0
you can choose @entity203 with zero calories , and you do n't have to line up at the @entity205 to renew your license plates			0
all these improvements were brought to you by people who got rich along the way -- and so will the next wave of improvements after that			0
the president 's call for higher taxes on the rich will only stifle and slow consumer progress			2
the president is offering higher taxes to support more benefits			0
i 'm offering lower taxes to drive more improvements in the private economy and better products and services for you			0
do n't expect the candidates ever to speak that frankly -- too risky			2
but if you pay attention , you can discover the inner message behind the warm fog of campaign rhetoric			0
so there 's your choice , @entity11 : because while we may have put 100 new cereal varieties on the shelves , at the voting booth it 's still just red or @entity242			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity245 .			2

@entity245 : @entity11 workers have been losing ground for decades
he says president @entity59 's answer is to make up for wage declines with government aid
@entity60 's view is that government ca n't prop up wages but should enable innovators , @entity245 said
@entity260 : the candidates wo n't fully own up to their visions , but you can read between the lines
