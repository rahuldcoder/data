-- the killing of 6 - month - old @entity2 has been held up as a new low in @entity5 's struggle to keep senseless death off its streets , as a rallying cry to do something about gun violence and as proof that no one -- even the most innocent among us -- is safe			1
on tuesday , it was also about @entity2			1
hundreds braved the cold on the city 's @entity17 , standing in a line that wrapped around the @entity20 as they waited to pay their respects			1
some people , many of whom had never met @entity2 or her family , broke down in tears when her hearse passed by			1
inside the church , more tears flowed			0
mourners walked past the infant 's open casket , as pictures flashed behind on a screen behind -- an ultrasound , from baby showers , of her as a newborn			2
to the side sat stuffed animals , including one large pink teddy bear , and a drawing of @entity2 with the words , " @entity44 's angel			1
" @entity5 baby shot while dad changes diaper " it 's just very , very sad , " said @entity48 , a friend of the family			1
" i just wish we could do something about it			0
" beyond remembering the little girl , doing something in the wake of her violent death was a prevailing theme at the funeral			2
some of that message involved taking personal responsibility ; some of it involved coming together , as a community , to reject gun violence			0
@entity48 said progress might start with being more willing to " snitch " to police about those behind shootings that have ravaged his city in recent months			2
the church 's pastor , @entity70 , told mourners this incident should show people they must always be prepared for " tragedy " to come to their doorstep			2
@entity77 , an activist who did not know @entity2 's family but felt compelled to come out tuesday , says she hoped the pointless killing of a baby girl , as she sat on her father 's lap , wakes people up			1
she hopes that there wo n't be more parents like @entity2 's , faced with the horrible task of burying their child			1
" we sort of left our children behind and to fend for themselves , " @entity88 said			0
" and it 's time for us to take our children back			0
" some 506 people were killed in @entity5 last year , according to local crime statistics , up from 433 in 2011			2
the torrid pace continued into 2013 , with 43 homicides in january , and after a drop in february , they 've picked up once again			0
@entity5 's record murder rate @entity2 became part of those grisly statistics when one bullet struck her march 11 , not several as initially reported , as she sat with her father in a vehicle on the @entity17			1
that bullet damaged several parts of her small body , and she died the next day			0
her father , @entity107 -- believed to be the target of the shooting , according to police -- was also hit			2
@entity112 superintendent @entity111 said @entity2 has been cooperating with authorities , adding that police have surveillance footage of a van in which the gunman sped away after the shooting			1
despite his injuries , @entity2 attended his daughter 's funeral			1
mourners also saw images of him holding his baby girl			0
@entity70 , the church 's pastor , said he hopes tuesday 's outpouring of support -- and the positive steps he hopes @entity130 will take in their own lives , and those of their neighbors , to prevent such violence -- will show the world their suffering and their dedication to stand behind one another			0
" the world thinks that there 's nothing but animals that live on the @entity17 , but we 've proved to them today that we are real people ... with real experiences , " he said			1
" and we hurt just like they hurt			0
" @entity0 's @entity147 reported from @entity5 , and @entity148 wrote this story from @entity150			0
@entity0 's @entity151 and @entity152 contributed to this report .			0
