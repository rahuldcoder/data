-- @entity2 nations overwhelmingly rejected nearly 50 years of @entity4 policy toward @entity5 on wednesday , voting at a meeting of the @entity7 in @entity8 to revoke the communist nation 's 1962 suspension from the multinational group			1
@entity8 president @entity12 says farewell to @entity13 at wednesday 's @entity7 meeting			1
@entity8 president @entity12 said at the end of the two - day meeting in the city of @entity18 that the @entity7 had rectified a serious error			1
the @entity4 led the push to suspend @entity5 from the @entity7 at the height of the @entity22 , also breaking diplomatic relations with the island nation in 1961 and establishing an economic embargo the next year			1
" this is an important message to the whole world , not just our continent , " @entity30 said , later adding , " @entity22 ended today in @entity18			2
" the @entity4 sought to obtain concessions from @entity5 this year in exchange for readmission to the 35 - nation group			1
in particular , the @entity4 wants greater political and personal freedoms for the island 's 11 million citizens			1
@entity5 rejected any preconditions , with former president @entity39 saying this week @entity5 had no interest in rejoining the @entity7			1
although the @entity7 lifted @entity5 's suspension , @entity42 leaders did not automatically welcome the nation back			1
instead , the @entity7 set up a mechanism by which @entity5 could rejoin			1
much of that dialogue will center on human rights			0
@entity4 secretary of state @entity13 said she was " pleased " with the outcome , which came on a voice vote with no opposition			1
" the member nations of the @entity7 showed flexibility and openness today , and as a result we reached a consensus that focuses on the future instead of the past : @entity5 can come back into the @entity7 in the future if the @entity7 decides that its participation meets the purposes and principles of the organization , including democracy and human rights , " @entity59 said in a statement			1
she attended the two - day meeting but left before the vote to travel to @entity71 , where president @entity72 was to make a major address to the @entity75 world thursday			0
some analysts agreed with @entity59 's assessment			0
" the @entity7 emerged from a heated debate with a constructive compromise that revokes an obsolete @entity22 resolution suspending @entity5 , " said @entity78 , who was a @entity2 national security adviser for president @entity79 in the late 1970s			1
" but rather than invite @entity5 to join the @entity7 , which @entity5 said it would not do , it invited @entity5 to initiate a dialogue on the purposes and principles of the @entity7			1
" others saw the vote as an outright rebuke for an outdated @entity4 policy			2
" i would n't say it was inevitable , but it was almost so , " said @entity90 , who worked as a top level official at the @entity92 in @entity5 from 1958 to 1961 during the @entity93 that brought @entity39 to power			2
" the @entity4 was totally isolated on this , " said @entity90 , who also was the chief of mission at the @entity4 interests section in @entity97 from 1979 - 82			1
" the @entity4 had some legitimate points on readmitting @entity5 , " @entity90 said , but went about it wrong			1
@entity101 , director of the @entity102 - based @entity104 policy institute , saw the vote as a personal defeat for @entity59			0
" this will be presented in @entity2 as a big defeat for @entity13 because people are not ready to take a swat at @entity72 yet , " @entity101 said			2
" it was hers to win , but she managed to lose it			0
" the @entity4 is being " hypercautious , " he said , rather than taking imaginative and bold steps toward normalizing relations			2
analysts said many people in @entity2 expected more from the newly elected @entity72 , who ran on a mantra of " change			0
" said @entity90 : " the @entity72 policy has reflected so little change that the other countries are just fed up			0
" and many @entity125 gauge the @entity4 -- long considered with suspicion , if not outright hostility -- by its stance toward @entity5			1
" the road to rehabilitating relations with @entity2 is through @entity97 , " @entity101 said			0
" that 's something that the @entity132 are very responsive to			0
" @entity133 , a @entity2 analyst with the @entity135 consulting firm , saw the vote as " a largely symbolic gesture that will have little impact in the short term either on improving democracy and human rights on the island , or on increasing the likelihood that the @entity4 will lift the embargo of the island			2
" and the vote could have a backlash , she said			0
" there will be a strong reaction among certain members of @entity150 who are passionately opposed to improving @entity4 - @entity5 relations while the @entity152 remain in power , " @entity133 said			1
that reaction was quick to come wednesday			0
" today we witnessed an example of the @entity72 administration 's absolute diplomatic incompetence and its unrestricted appeasement of the enemies of the @entity4 , " @entity161 - @entity2 @entity4 reps			1
@entity162 , @entity163 , and @entity164 , @entity163 , said in a joint statement			0
" the @entity7 is a putrid embarrassment			2
" other @entity161 - @entity2 members of @entity150 also released statements criticizing the vote			0
the @entity4 provides about 60 percent of @entity7 funding , @entity133 said , and some members of @entity150 have threatened to withhold the money if @entity5 is allowed back into the organization			1
some old @entity2 hands agree that the @entity7 may have hurt itself			2
" i never cease to be amazed at how destructive some of these @entity2 leaders can be , " said @entity175 , who served in high - level @entity2 posts for presidents @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179			0
" they chose to revive something out of the @entity22			2
" the @entity42 leaders , @entity175 said , misread @entity102			0
" some of these countries have further isolated themselves from the @entity72 administration , " @entity175 said			0
" it will be a long time before they regain the trust of the @entity2 government			0
" @entity175 , a strong anti-communist , also opposed the vote on ideological grounds			0
" the problem is that the conditions that suspended @entity5 still exist , " he said			0
" @entity5 has n't changed			0
