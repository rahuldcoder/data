-- @entity2 's @entity1 rode to glory in gap tuesday as @entity6 leader @entity5 was left fuming by a late high speed tangle with arch rival @entity8			1
@entity9 was part of a 26 - strong breakaway group , who were allowed free reign on the 16th stage as @entity5 and the rest of the yellow jersey contenders waged their own private battle			1
@entity1 , who was winning his second tour stage , crossed the line after 168km from @entity20 to gap in three hours 52 minutes 45 seconds			2
he made a timely attack on the final second category climb of a testing day 's racing to finish 42 seconds clear of second placed @entity26 of @entity27			2
@entity28 's @entity5 came under repeated attack on the final ascent from @entity8 of @entity31 , but with help from @entity35 teammate @entity34 , each was repulsed			1
the final tricky descent into @entity4 saw @entity37 's @entity8 make further attempts to claw back vital time on the race leader , but on a sharp corner , just over eight kilometers from the finish , he hit the tarmac			1
@entity5 was also impeded and had to briefly take one foot out of his pedals , but was unscathed			0
porte then guided the pair back to the elite group , which also contained second - placed @entity47 , @entity49 @entity48 and @entity50 of @entity51			0
@entity8 appeared to be examining injuries to his elbow , but rode freely to the finish			0
he remained in third place overall , 11 seconds behind @entity47 , but four minutes 25 seconds in arrears of the all - conquering @entity5 , who was clearly unimpressed by @entity8 's approach			1
" it was bit careless of @entity8 , " he told @entity58			0
" he overcooked one of the corners and came off in front of me			0
" i just think at this stage of the race he is obviously getting desperate , attacking on the descents , " he added			0
the big loser on the day was @entity47 's @entity69 teammate @entity68 , who was distanced by the late attacks and dropped out of the top five			0
@entity72 was praised though for his sportmanship in refraining from making a further attack after @entity8 and @entity5 were held up by their incident			2
wednesday 's 17th stage will give another clue as to the eventual winner of the centenary edition of the @entity6 -- a 32km mountain time trial from @entity83 to @entity84 in the @entity85			2
@entity5 , who extended his lead by winning sunday 's stage to @entity88 , will be favored to take the honors as he bids to improve his second place on the 2012 tour .			1
