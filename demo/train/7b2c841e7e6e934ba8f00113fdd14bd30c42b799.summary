-- @entity1 , the fastest - growing web company on the planet , reportedly turned down a $ 6 billion buyout offer from @entity5 late last week			1
sounds crazy , right ? for most two - year - old companies , the idea of getting a $ 6 billion offer -- never mind turning it down -- is a wild dream			0
especially for an idea like @entity1 that seems so simple : @entity13 money - saving coupon offers for local businesses , delivered by e-mail and over the web ( a $ 50 credit to the gap on sale for $ 25 , for example )			1
so it 's understandable that @entity1 's decision surprised people			1
but @entity1 was actually smart to turn down @entity5 's offer			1
why ? because @entity1 is wildly growing in popularity , and is picking up steam so fast that there is no knowing how much it could be worth in a year -- potentially much more than it is now			2
here 's a snapshot of the company 's growth : @entity1 says it currently has 40 million subscribers to its daily coupon e-mails , up from 1.5 million a year ago			1
it is offering deals in more than 300 markets in 35 countries , up from just 28 @entity39 markets last year			0
and @entity1 says it has saved its customers more than $ 800 million so far this year , up from about $ 50 million last year			2
for consumers , that means spending less cash -- always a nice thing in tough economic times			0
and for local businesses , that means bringing new customers in the door , which makes them happy , too			0
that 's why so many restaurants , stores , and service providers are rushing to get their deals on @entity1 that the company has had to change its business model to keep up -- no longer just " one deal per day , per city , " but several potential deals , customized for the user			2
as for the company itself , @entity1 has more than 3,000 employees -- up from about 125 last year -- including about 1,000 in its wacky @entity65 headquarters			2
( do n't miss our photo tour -- it 's truly wild			0
) and while there are competitors like @entity71 , which has some 10 million subscribers , attracting a lot of attention and investment , @entity1 is still leading the pack			2
therefore , the promise of further explosive growth is the biggest reason that @entity1 was smart to turn down @entity5 's offer			1
imagine @entity81 selling to @entity82 for $ 1 billion in 2006 -- it would n't have been worth $ 50 billion right now			0
or imagine that @entity5 had taken @entity82 's meager offer early in its history , too			2
it would n't be worth almost $ 200 billion as it is today			0
but there 's another big reason why it 's smart for @entity1 to remain independent , for now : the idea that @entity5 could destroy @entity1 under its leadership , due to a massive culture clash			1
if history is any indication , @entity5 would probably have tried to change @entity1 , to make it more googly			1
but the two companies have vastly different structures and cultures			0
and based on our understanding of @entity1 , @entity5 could potentially ruin @entity1 very easily			1
why ? because @entity1 is primarily a sales and writing organization , built on people - power and smiles			1
of its 3,000 employees around the world , most are in sales , customer support , and editorial			0
the company employs comedy writers and improv actors , and nurtures corporate gags like an office elaborately decorated as a bedroom for an imaginary , deranged tenant			0
it 's very funny , but also the kind of thing that the brains at @entity5 probably would n't find funny , or support			0
" i 'm not sure this is a tech company that gets built in @entity127 or @entity128 , " @entity1 co-founder and ceo @entity122 told us when we visited his office last month			2
" it 's so heavily people - dependent -- not really consistent with the way people think about building startups in @entity133			1
" @entity5 , meanwhile , is the prototypical @entity134 tech company -- the master algorithm			0
yes , there are lots of people at @entity5 , too , including many sales and support staff			1
but @entity5 's culture is dominated by engineers , the sort of high - @entity144 geniuses who can answer all of the brain - teaser @entity5 interview questions			2
and that clash could have been a big problem for @entity1			0
so for those reasons , @entity1 actually looks smart for turning down @entity5 's $ 6 billion offer			1
of course , that 's not to say that the companies wo n't figure out a deal in the future , or that there is n't a chance that @entity1 could stumble , and be worth less in the future			0
but based on the way @entity1 is growing in popularity today -- and is expected to generate more than $ 2 billion in sales next year -- turning down @entity5 's offer is n't as crazy as it sounds			1
