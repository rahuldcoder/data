@entity1 , @entity0 -- the @entity0 teen accused of planning to bomb his high school had a detailed itinerary for his attack that included napalm bombs , firearms and killing himself before the police could , authorities said tuesday			1
according to a three - page probable cause affidavit released by authorities , an investigator wrote that police found notebooks and other documents in 17 - year - old @entity19 's room			1
they contained handwritten and typed plans , including diagrams , to commit mass murder , the affidavit said			2
in one of the plans , @entity19 wrote that he wanted to go to first period then take a few hours in the parking lot to prepare for his attack , during which he would " shoot and throw bombs throughout the school			1
" on tuesday , the teen appeared in court via a video feed from jail			1
it was the initial hearing for a gawky teenager accused of plotting a monstrous crime			0
he sat awkwardly in a folding chair , shoulders slumped			0
when the judge entered , @entity19 snapped to attention in front of a microphone			1
unsure of where to position himself , he answered the judge 's questions in calm , respectful , short answers			2
it was a surreal juxtaposition to see the face and demeanor of a young man who authorities say modeled his plan on the 1999 massacre at @entity58 's @entity57			1
@entity60 's timeline -- which police say he entitled " the ( @entity65 ) @entity64 " -- would have begun at 7:30 a.m. and would have ended with an attack just after 11:10			2
the writing said he planned to pack his truck with the bombs and guns at home , go to @entity73 and slip out of class after first period			0
then he would have waited until 10 a.m. where he would have moved to " smoke spot " to " gear up			0
" after that , he planned to move to another parking lot , check for a school resource officer , and if none was there , he would back in the truck at 11:10 a.m. into a spot near one of the exits he had staked out			0
his harrowing plan continued : " get gear out of trunk			2
carry duffle in one hand , napalm firebomb in the other , walk towards school with ( @entity95 music from the @entity97 video game ) blasting out of car			1
light and throw napalm , unzip bag and begin firing			0
@entity103 state : ' the @entity105 grim reaper is here			0
' if 3rd exit is blocked by napalm fire , or is locked , run to 1st entrance			0
" the plan ends with a suicide			2
" kill myself before @entity113 engages me , " he writes			0
he was charged as an adult with attempted aggravated murder and 18 other charges related to making and possessing a destructive device			0
@entity19 , who said little throughout the proceeding , did not enter a plea			1
a judge set bond at $ 2 million			1
authorities are still not saying when @entity19 wanted to launch his plan			1

officials at the school and police said a fellow student 's tip led to @entity19 's arrest			1

@entity178 , who emphasized he can not comment on @entity19 's case because he has n't treated him , said he has seen youngsters with pans become deeply fearful and violent with their parents			1
" i think the thing that shocks parents is how quickly they change			0
they can snap , " he said			0
in his research , however , he has never seen any sufferer premeditate violence in the manner outlined in the allegations against @entity60			0
" there has not been a kid who has done anything close to this , " the doctor said			0
there are no clear diagnostic criteria for @entity148 , according to the @entity207 , which says the disorder is marked by a rapid onset and intensification of obsessive - compulsive behaviors			0
