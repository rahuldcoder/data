-- @entity1 kept its eyes forward and revealed what is coming for the @entity4 this year and next at its 2014 @entity6 briefing in @entity7 , @entity8			1
however , it is what they did n't talk about that might be more interesting			0
@entity13 , head of the @entity14 at the @entity16 , @entity17 , company hosted nearly 90 minutes of gameplay demonstrations , cinematic trailers , and the company 's vision for its home entertainment console			1
but unlike last year , when the company rolled out its @entity4 console heavily touting its connection to @entity25 , the troubled hands - free controller only got one brief mention during a segment on independent development			1
there also were no mentions of other forms of entertainment on the console in the software - focused presentation			2
" it fits the strategy of turning around 180 degrees , " said @entity36 gaming journalist @entity35			0
" last year , they showed very little gaming			0
this year , they showed nothing but games			0
" @entity1 originally bundled the @entity4 and the @entity25 system together -- saying it was the best way to enjoy entertainment on the console			1
recently , they said they were heeding customer feedback when the company released an @entity4 without the @entity25 at a cheaper price			1
" it is a risky game they are playing , " @entity35 said			0
" game makers now have to make the decision whether to make games with the @entity25			1
" earlier this month , 45 new entertainment apps were made available , offering more content choices through the @entity4			1
but that was all absent from monday 's event			0
even more peculiar , @entity13 mentioned @entity63 and @entity64 by name and offered praise to those companies for joining @entity1 in shaping the future of entertainment the best way they know how -- through gaming			1
he said the entire briefing would be about gaming and promised a slate of titles for this year , plus a strong look at next year and beyond			0
the greatest reaction came when master chief , the iconic character from the " @entity79 " franchise , appeared on the screen			2
" @entity79 5 : @entity82 " is expected to be a personal journey for @entity77			1
the creators at @entity84 wanted players to remember where @entity77 came from , so this fall , " @entity79 : master chief collection " will contain all four previous games , completely unlocked and playable in a seamless sequence up to the beginning of " @entity79			2
" there is also content coming to mark the 10th anniversary of " @entity95			0
" other third - party titles showed off what 's to come this year on the @entity4			1
" @entity98 : @entity99 , " " @entity100 , " and " @entity101 : music evolved , " are part of the strong slate of games that will be available by the end of the year			0
looking to 2015 and beyond , a world - premier video showed the next chapter for protagonist @entity109 with " @entity109 : rise of the @entity110			0
" independent game makers were also highlighted by the computing giant			2
hundreds of new games are expected as more creative talent takes advantage of @entity116 , a publishing platform for independent developers			0
the program offers indie companies the chance to build , hone , develop , and self - publish games on the @entity4			2
@entity13 closed the show reiterating @entity1 's commitment to building and developing great games			1
" we are ready to invest to bring new creators to the @entity4 , " @entity13 said , adding the investment will " shape the future of the @entity4			0
" it was n't quite the buzz of last year 's presentation of a new console			1
but monday 's showcase perhaps signaled a renewed focus for @entity1 on what makes gamers happy : games .			2

@entity1 's @entity6 presentation had virtually no mention of the @entity25 system
by contrast , the company highlighted its use with @entity4 last year
entertainment apps also were *shunned* in favor of game talk
upcoming " @entity79 5 , " got the crowd excited
