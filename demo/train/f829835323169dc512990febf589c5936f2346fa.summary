-- in case anyone had a shadow of a doubt that most @entity6 students are precocious , smart , if not learned , we hear from the lips of @entity6 's @entity9 , @entity10 , that nearly all the students at @entity6 are indeed above average -- so much so that the median grade given is an @entity14 and the most frequent grade awarded is an a ! what are we to make of the news ? well , first of all , this is not exactly news			1
@entity6 and many elite colleges across the country have witnessed the creeping ivy of grade inflation for quite some time -- a situation that has just about eliminated failure as a possibility			1
it makes one wonder why the school bothers giving grades at all			1
in the mid- 1970s , when i was a dean at @entity33 , there were rumors that a certain professor was indiscriminately awarding a final grade of a to all his students			1
that was unusual back then when most professors graded on the bell curve and only a handful of the best students received an @entity14 some actually failed and most received grades of b or @entity46 but in the case of this particular professor everybody got an @entity14 as a test , i surreptitiously enrolled a fictitious student into the roster of his next class			1
this " nobody " never came to class , never wrote a term paper and never took an exam			0
at the end of the semester the mysterious student received an @entity14 that led to a discussion with the professor			1
in a tone of righteous indignation he claimed i had overstepped my bounds to play such a trick on him			0
with righteous indignation i claimed that he had underperformed as a professor by acting in a reckless manner , grading his students with careless abandonment			2
steam came out of both our ears			0
i believed his actions were a mark of failure in academic responsibility			0
they are a tool that measures a student 's progress in relation to others in a class ; they allow financial aid and scholarship committees to assess merit ; and they culminate in a 4 - year overall performance record in the form of a college transcript			2
academic strengths and weaknesses are discovered over a period of time			0
to some extent @entity6 's faculty have abandoned their responsibilities to their students as well as to those who wish to judge their students : admission officers at law and medical school ; faculty selecting graduates to mentor them for advanced degree programs ; employers deciding between applicants for jobs			1
decades ago , professors were often characterized by their students on the severity of their grading			2
professor @entity119 is a tough grader -- no one gets an @entity121 , professor @entity122 is an easy grader -- no one fails			0
what can be said today ? all the professors are easy marks as well as easy markers			0
why give everyone an a ? when the admissions office puts together a freshman class full of high school valedictorians who have perfect grades and sat scores , there is no doubt they are bringing capable students to the campus			1
but the power has shifted from the faculty to the students and a new form of entitlement on the part of students has developed			2
if students are paying $ 55,000 a year , they may feel they have paid for the @entity151 in dollars as well as sense			2
is there an unspoken academic transaction that is filtering into the university landscape now that tuition prices are in the stratosphere ? has higher education morphed into a consumer business in which the customer is always right ? it seems like it			1
first , universities have to compete for students in the marketplace			2
then faculties do the same after students enroll			2
professors want to be popular			0
they want good ratings from students at the end of semester reviews just as the students want good grades from them			1
gut courses , once the exception , have become more common			0
faculty tenure , promotions and raises may turn on such matters right along with publications and other measures			0
@entity33 life , long a contact sport , has been upgraded to a blood sport			0
it 's become a " dog - eat - dog " business in which departments try to fill quotas for majors			2
and then there are the parents who are quick to speak out if they think their sons or daughters are under appreciated			0
is there a solution that can stop grade inflation ? yes , of course			1
in 2004 , @entity198 readjusted their grading system instructing the faculty not give more than 35 % of their undergraduate students a or a- grades , and apparently @entity204 is currently discussing a similar adjustment			1
@entity6 faculty should construct a ladder that has a rung at the bottom , middle and top			1
last week , i had the privilege to chair the @entity216 selection committee for the @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity220 district			0
we interviewed 13 semi-finalists and selected 2 award winners			0
all 13 were exceptional ; the final decision came down to the splitting of hairs			0
out of the 32 @entity216 named across the @entity228 , @entity6 students came away with 6 , an impressive outcome however one slices the pie			1
perhaps they are all a students			0
but now we know many @entity6 students receive as			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity235 .			1

the most frequent grade given at @entity6 is a and the median grade is @entity14
@entity240 : grade inflation can be stopped ; just look at @entity198
he says it seems that higher education has morphed into a consumer business
@entity235 : @entity248 want good student reviews just as students want good grades
