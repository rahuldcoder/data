-- when @entity2 introduced the @entity3 last january , the biggest surprise was n't the actual product			1
( many shrugged and called the @entity3 a " bigger @entity5			2
" ) it was the price : just $ 500			0
nobody expected that number , perhaps because @entity8 has traditionally aimed at the high end of the mobile computer market with macbooks marked $ 1,000 and up			2
and perhaps we were also thrown off because @entity8 execs repeatedly told investors they could n't produce a $ 500 computer that was n't a piece of junk			2
but @entity8 did meet that price , and the @entity3 is n't junk			1
the @entity3 is still the first , and best - selling , product of its kind			1
competitors , meanwhile , are having trouble hitting that $ 500 sweet spot			0
@entity26 's @entity25 tablet is debuting in the @entity27 with an $ 800 price tag			0
( to be fair , the most comparable @entity3 is $ 730 -- but there 's no $ 500 @entity25 planned , and the lack of a low - end entry point will hurt @entity26			1
) @entity33 's @entity32 , with a relatively puny 7 - inch screen , costs $ 600 without a contract			0
why is it so hard to get to a lower starting price ? and how was @entity8 able to get there ? @entity39 of @entity40 suggests it largely has to do with @entity8 's retail strategy			2
@entity8 now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling @entity3 directly to customers			1
that 's advantageous , because if the @entity3 were primarily sold at third - party retail stores , a big chunk of profit would go to those retailers , @entity39 reasons			1
@entity8 has partnered with a few retail chains such as @entity52 and @entity53 , but those stores always seem to get a small number of units in stock			1
@entity39 rationalizes that the true purpose of these partnerships is probably to help spread the marketing message , not so much to sell @entity3			0
" the company can swallow the bitter pill of hardly making any money from @entity3 sales through its retail partners because it can feast off the fat profits it makes when customers buy directly through its retail outlets and the web store , " @entity39 says			1
" however , companies like @entity26 , @entity71 , and @entity33 have to make all of their profit by selling their tablets wholesale to retailer partners			0
" the retail advantage is a reasonable theory , but @entity39 neglects to mention the high overhead costs that @entity8 must pay handsomely for each of its 300 stores			1
to @entity39 's credit , @entity8 running its own stores does present clear benefits : the customer outreach is enormous , and of course , in @entity8 stores , @entity8 products do n't have to compete with gadgets sold by rivals on other shelves			2
but when we try to decipher why the @entity3 costs $ 500 , we have to consider the sum of all parts , not just the retail strategy			2
@entity8 is the most vertically integrated company in the world			0
in addition to operating its own retail chains , all @entity8 hardware and software are designed in - house , and @entity8 also runs its own digital content store , @entity101			1
designing in - house means @entity8 does n't have to pay licensing fees to third parties to use their intellectual property			2
for instance , the @entity107 chip inside the @entity3 is based on technology developed and owned by @entity8 ( not @entity110 , @entity111 or @entity112 )			1
the operating system is @entity8 's own , not something licensed from @entity115 or @entity116			0
why do you think @entity71 bought @entity118 to make the touchpad ? @entity71 wanted ownership of a mobile operating system in - house to take control of its own mobile destiny and stop being so reliant on @entity115 ( which , to this day , does n't have a credible tablet strategy )			0
on the @entity101 media platform , @entity8 takes a cut of each sale made through each of its digital storefronts : the @entity131 , ibooks and @entity101 music and video			0
ibooks still has a long way to go before it 's anywhere near as big as @entity137 , but the @entity131 and @entity101 are the most successful digital media stores of their kind			0
at the end of the day , the @entity3 might be worth well above $ 500 for all we know			0
( @entity143 estimates made by component analysts such as @entity145 are n't very useful because they fail to measure costs of r&d and other factors			0
) it 's most likely that @entity8 can afford to absorb the costs of producing and selling the @entity3 because of the tenacious ecosystem backing it , and also because it has such tight oversight over every aspect of the company to control price			1
that 's what it all boils down to : ecosystems and control			0
competitors are struggling to match the $ 500 price point because they are n't as fully integrated as @entity8 , in terms of retail strategy , a digital content market , hardware and software engineering -- everything			1
as @entity2 famously put it one day , " @entity8 is the last company in our industry that creates the whole widget			2
" competitors are having trouble beating the @entity3 widget			1
