-- how would you design a movie poster for a @entity4 blockbuster you 'd never seen , filled with characters you knew nothing about and actors you 'd never heard of ? would @entity8 look like a surgical glove stuffed full of walnuts ? would cujo the killer dog look like a guilty spaniel that 'd devoured the cake at a child 's birthday party ? would @entity16 have the stunned expression of a man who had just received a large electricity bill ? if your only brief was to pack a crowd into a mobile african cinema hall , you might also want to add some incidental aliens shooting laser beams from their eyes			1
in @entity26 -- where the @entity27 of movie posters during the 1980s and 1990s produced these lurid , vibrant and outlandish originals -- the movie poster may be a dying art form but it has since become big business			1
@entity34 collectors now pay thousands for prime examples of the genre and the artists who once churned out the posters to fill @entity26 's dilapidated cinema clubs are finding a new lease of life reproducing them for art aficionados			1
@entity44 , 39 , began painting the posters when he was 14 years old but now works from his home in @entity48 , @entity26 , to produce them for art dealers , selling them for between $ 75 and $ 100 apiece			1
currently putting the finishing touches on a canvas cut from a flour sack , he 's producing a distinctively @entity26 take on the biopic " @entity58 : @entity59			1
" " action and war works a lot ... and women too : both actually , " @entity64 told @entity0 , showing that @entity4 's time - honored recipe of sex and violence is an international language			2
" it all depends on what the audience prefers			0
" read more : keeping @entity73 's star of democracy shining when he produced these originals for @entity26 's cinema clubs --- often no more than rows of seats in the open air around a gas - powered generator and a tv set with a @entity83 --- his job was to draw crowds			1
to do this , he applied his imagination to the canvas , producing scenes that did n't exist in the original film ; placing dripping knives in the hands of zombie assassins or guns at the ready for various heroes who had no weapons in the actual film			2
these surreal variations spiced up a whole generation of schlock - horror films that came out of @entity100 , @entity4 , @entity101 , and its @entity103 equivalent @entity102			1
as one critic remarked , the posters are often far better than the films			2
african art dealer @entity107 , who first noticed the movie posters in 1990 while researching @entity26 's phenomenon of fantasy coffins , said that despite the untutored style of the posters , the artists knew exactly what effect they wanted to create			1
" they are definitely very , very good artists and they paint exactly what they want , " said @entity114 who has written two books on the genre " @entity117 " and " @entity118			0
" " having looked at hundreds of them , you become aware of their individual hand , their idiosyncrasies and their brush strokes			0
" the ones that interest me the most are the ones before the tradition died in about 2000			0

while they 're still being made by some of the artists that produced them two decades ago , @entity114 explained , they 're now made as commodities for the art market			1
" the best of the @entity27 movie posters -- from the ' 80s to the late ' 90s -- are the ones where they just completely went out into the land where there are no rules , " he said			1
" it gave them an incredible freedom to be expressive			0
" they made images that they knew would bring people in and no one was looking over their shoulder to tell them they could n't do anything			0
" the only restriction , he said , was the size of the canvases which fell strictly into two versions : one side of a 50kg flour bag or two sides stitched together			1
" apart from that , there were no limits			0
" he said the works also fall into the realm of art artifact where the evidence of their original purpose is also part of the narrative			2
" the work patterns of their use ; having been nailed up by their corners and splattered by mud from passing buses also tell a rich story about how they were utilized , " @entity114 said			0
with rare vintage works fetching as much as $ 15,000 and @entity27 posters routinely going for between $ 1,500 and $ 3,000 , a market in fakes has emerged			2
@entity114 , however , remains sanguine			0
" it 's possible to say they 're fakes but it 's also possible to say they 're a homage , " he said			0
while the commoditized versions are still artworks in their own right , @entity114 said they occupy a different zone to the stark immediacy of the originals			0
" there 's a big difference between those works that were produced for them , @entity26 , and the ones that are produced for us ( collectors )			2
" @entity0 's @entity214 series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries we profile			0
however @entity0 retains full editorial control over all of its reports			0

hand - painted movie posters from ' 80 and ' 90s have become collectibles
originally painted to attract people to local cinema clubs in @entity26
most were painted on used flour sacks stitched together
original artists continue to produce imagined versions of current films to feed growing art market
