@entity0 -- a group of locals looked on warily as we filmed our piece inside a congested , riverside @entity0 neighborhood			1
and they 've every reason to feel nervous			2
a number of deadly collapses in recent months have thrust the issue of illegally constructed and unsafe housing into the spotlight			1
on june 28 , a four - story building in the city suddenly toppled over killing 10 people , including five children			1
that same day , an eleven - floor building under construction came crashing down in the southern @entity21 city of @entity22 , killing 61 workers			1
both incidents made headlines outside @entity21 -- and rightly so			1
but for many of the people living in these neighborhoods , the publicity is not necessarily welcome			2
that 's because they 're among the poorest and most vulnerable -- on one hand they fear for the safety of their homes , and on the other they fear being forcibly evicted and their homes destroyed			1
they have nowhere else to go			2
so when tv crews arrive , many are understandably defensive			2
as we filmed in @entity45 , a neighborhood of eastern @entity0 located along the @entity46 , pockmarked with ramshackle residential blocks , a man approached us and questioned whether we had the right to film			1
" you know , everyone gets worried when they see cameras pointing at their buildings , " he explained			2
" as the leader of this market association , we have to inquire about the purpose of your shoot			2
" safety codes ignored this part of the city is no stranger to disaster			1
in 2010 , at least 65 people were killed when a building came down after its foundations had been weakened by rainwater			1
it 's not just @entity0 ; decrepit constructions that do n't conform to safety codes are a big problem in cities and towns across @entity21 , says @entity74 , from the @entity21 home ministry 's @entity75			1
he has surveyed @entity0 's structures for decades , and says most break basic building regulations			1
he says the problem is so pervasive that enforcement has become impossible			1
" our systems are not equipped to enforce engineering standards required to build safe houses			2
there 's a gross shortage of manpower , expertise -- and maybe will			2
" the @entity0 residential block that caved in on june 28 was built on a plot barely 19 square yards			1
with no pillars or beams to support its floors , it collapsed after neighbors starting removing earth to re-build their own house			0
safety codes prescribe at least 150 square yards of land is required to construct a standard apartment , explains @entity74			2
buildings in @entity21 cities are often unplanned and strung together in cramped rows , without space between them			1
experts say this can be disastrous if one is more structurally vulnerable than the others			0
owners of buildings often sell off parts of these buildings to individuals , who then construct extensions			0
" this type of housing is not unauthorized but remains extremely dangerous , " says @entity74			0
" unfortunately , it 's mushrooming all over without checks and balances			0
" ' disaster waiting to happen ' with rapid urbanization occurring since @entity21 liberalized its economy in the 1990s , @entity0 's population has grown exponentially to almost 17 million -- more than 21 % in the past decade , census figures show			1
to make matters worse , @entity21 authorities believe the @entity21 capital is vulnerable to seismic activity			1
in 1999 , an 6.5 magnitude earthquake some 173 miles ( 280 kilometers ) from @entity0 caused some damage to buildings in the city , but raised fears about the potential harm from another temblor of similar intensity happening nearer			1
it 's a " disaster waiting to happen , " according to @entity74			0
according to @entity0 's disaster - management department website , " pockets with high - rise buildings or ill - designed high - risk areas exist without specific consideration of earthquake resistance			1
similarly , unplanned settlements with sub-standard structures are also prone to heavy damage even in moderate shaking			0
" yet people have to continue to put themselves at risk because they 've nowhere else to go			0
" a lethal cocktail of unethical constructions , substandard material ( and ) a lack of enforcement ... are endangering countless lives , " says @entity74			1
" these fatal incidents happening every now and then are a warning			0
it 's time all stakeholders , including citizens , took it seriously			0
" meantime , two injured survivors mourn their loved ones at the site of last month 's @entity0 collapse			1
his head bandaged , @entity169 recalled how he literally rode the wave of debris when he tumbled four floors down			0
underneath the rubble were his wife and three children , who all died			0
" i had just freshened myself up on the terrace			0
my wife and children were on lower floors			0
suddenly , there was this boom			0
the building was down , " he recalls			2
@entity184 was also pulled out alive , suffering only bruising			0
but tragically , he too lost his wife and children			0
both men blame the neighbors for digging on ground their houses stood on			0
" there 's no strong action against them			0
we will stage a protest to demand that , " @entity184 warns			0
their neighbor , an unnamed man , has been charged with negligence , and faces a two - year jail term or fine upon conviction , police say .			0

@entity21 has seen a number of deadly building collapses in recent months
on june 28 , building collapses in @entity0 and @entity22 claimed more than *70* lives
*critics* point to a lack of safety enforcement and the use of substandard materials
