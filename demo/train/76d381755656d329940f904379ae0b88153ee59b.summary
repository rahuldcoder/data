a controversial new @entity1 law requiring voters to present personal identification before going to the polls has been blocked by the @entity6 administration			1
in a letter monday to state officials , the @entity7 said the legislation could have a discriminatory effect on hispanics and other minorities			0
@entity1 is among eight states to require official photo identification in an effort to stop what officials say is voter fraud			2
opponents of the laws say they disenfranchise poor , minority and disabled voters			0
the department concluded there is little evidence of voter fraud in @entity1 warranting the legislative changes			1
" we note that the state 's submission did not include evidence of significant in - person voter impersonation not already addressed by the state 's existing laws , " said @entity29 , assistant attorney general			1
the landmark @entity38 gives the federal government the power to oversee any changes in voting procedures in states and jurisdictions with a history of voter discrimination			0
@entity1 ' new voting boundaries for congressional and legislative seats are also being challenged separately in federal court			2
the @entity7 , relying on statistics provided by the state , said @entity12 in particular would be negatively affected by the @entity1 law			1
" under the data provided in january , @entity12 make up only 21.8 % of all registered voters , but fully 38.2 % of the registered voters who lack these forms of identification			0
thus , we conclude that the total number of registered voters who lack a driver 's license or personal identification card issued by ( the state @entity67 ) could range from 603,892 to 795,955 , " @entity29 said in the letter , addressed to the director of elections for the @entity1 secretary of state			2
" even using the data most favorable to the state , @entity12 disproportionately lack either a driver 's license or a personal identification card ... and that disparity is statistically significant , " @entity29 said			0
a similar voter id law in @entity75 was blocked by the @entity6 administration in december			1
@entity1 and @entity75 now have the option of asking a federal court in @entity79 to review the laws , and allow them to be enforced this election year			1
@entity1 gov. @entity82 released a statement soon after the @entity7 's decision was announced , slamming it as " yet another example of the @entity6 administration 's continuing and pervasive federal overreach			1
" " the @entity7 has no valid reason for rejecting this important law , which requires nothing more extensive than the type of photo identification necessary to receive a library card or board an airplane , " he said			1
@entity1 attorney general @entity94 has defended the law , saying it imposes " minor inconveniences on exercising the right to vote			2
" voters in the state would be required to present one of seven types of government - issued photo identification , including a driver 's license , a passport or a concealed handgun permit			2
those lacking the @entity109 would be given a provisional ballot , but the voter would have to present an approved document to the registrar 's office within six days after the election			0
those lacking an acceptable identification would be given a free voter identification card			0
section 5 of the @entity38 has been used by federal authorities for decades to oversee election changes in 16 states or selected areas , including parts of @entity125			0
@entity1 and other jurisdictions have chafed at the requirements , saying there has been no recent government effort to discriminate			0
they argue they should not continue to have the burden of showing that any voting changes would not burden or interfere with someone 's ability to vote			0
opponents of the voter id law in @entity1 have said minority voter turnout could be suppressed 3 % to 5 % at a time when the @entity143 population there is growing rapidly			1
there have also been complaints the new law has not been sufficiently publicized			0
" @entity1 ' voter id law would prevent countless latinos , african - americans , elderly citizens and others from casting their ballot , " said @entity147 , a staff attorney with the @entity149 's @entity148			1
" we 're pleased the @entity7 has recognized the harms this discriminatory law would have on people 's fundamental right to vote			1
" the @entity7 said @entity143 registered voters in @entity1 are 46.5 % to 120 % more likely than a @entity163 registered voter to lack the required identification			1
the nation 's second largest state has a population of 25.1 million , an increase of 4.3 million in the past decade			0
that explosive growth ensures @entity1 will gain four congressional seats , requiring new voting boundaries that are still being litigated in court			0
the @entity173 in january ordered a special federal court in @entity1 to reconsider its rejection of the maps approved by the state 's @entity178 majority .			2

@entity1 gov. @entity82 *describes* @entity6 's move as an example of " federal overreach "
the law requires people to show a photo id at the polling place
the @entity7 says there is little evidence of " in - person voter impersonation "
