@entity0 -- as they talked publicly in generalities about a smooth transition to a new government in @entity8 , @entity4 officials have been working behind the scenes on ways to " move that process forward , " a national security spokesman said			1
top members of the @entity14 administration stated thursday their desire for embattled @entity8 president @entity16 to leave office and for inclusive negotiations to begin immediately with his political opponents			1
@entity21 spokesman @entity20 added that @entity4 officials have also discussed with @entity8 officials " a variety of different ways " in which that new government could take shape			1
but @entity20 stressed " all of those decisions must be made by the @entity8 people			0
" a senior @entity14 administration official knocked down a @entity32 report that the @entity8 and @entity4 were near consensus on a specific proposal			1
" it 's simply wrong to report that there 's a single @entity4 plan that 's being negotiated with the @entity8 , " the official said			1
@entity4 officials have made clear in recent days their desire to jumpstart talks between opposition and ruling forces in order to lay the groundwork as soon as possible for a governmental transition			1
that includes pressuring , besides @entity16 's government , opposition groups to engage immediately in talks			1
@entity16 has announced he will not seek re-election in september			0
protesters , however , continue to demand that he step down immediately , with a caretaker unity government running the country until the fall elections			0
while some , like former foreign minister and @entity58 secretary general @entity57 , believe concessions made by @entity16 presented an opportunity to build upon , members of the opposition @entity55 have insisted no talks should take place until the president leaves office			2
" it 's time for both of them to roll up their sleeves , " a senior @entity66 official said			0
" the government has to take some steps , but the opposition has to be willing to participate in negotiations as well			0
" @entity8 vice president @entity76 made " important statements " about a political dialogue , the senior official said			1
still , he added that the @entity8 government should allow the opposition to bring its own ideas , rather than dictate the pace and scope of a transformation to democracy			2
the urgent call for talks comes as the @entity8 government pushed back on what it described as " vague " statements from the @entity14 administration about the pace of transition			1
an @entity8 government official told @entity1 the @entity94 has shown support for its " roadmap " for a transition up to when @entity16 's term ends in september , but said president @entity14 's calls for an " orderly transition " are at odds with his call for an immediate one			1
the official said @entity16 is seen as a " receding figure " in @entity8 politics , but warned that deposing him immediately would lead to a murky political process that would make free and fair elections difficult			1
according to the @entity8 constitution , the presidency would be transferred to the speaker of the parliament if @entity16 leaves power without enacting certain legislative and constitutional reforms			2
" institutionally , there is support in @entity8 for this roadmap among the military , vice president and prime minister , " said the @entity8 official			1
@entity4 officials said they believe what transpires friday -- when another massive anti-government protest is expected -- will be an important barometer on whether serious negotiations can take place			1
demonstrators may be less willing to talk if attacked			0
" it 's hard to imagine if there is a day of very bad violence , it will lead to the type of dialogue that needs to take place , " the senior @entity66 official said			0
these backroom discussions involving the @entity4 and @entity8 political players come as the @entity94 and legislators stepped up their public pressure on @entity16 's regime			1
on thursday , vice president @entity143 talked with @entity76 and pressed him that " credible , inclusive negotiations ( should ) begin immediately " with opposition political groups , a statement from @entity143 's office said			2
that sentiment was reiterated by @entity94 press secretary @entity150 , who told reporters " it is important that we all begin to see meaningful steps , and that negotiations take place between the ( current ) government and a broadly based group of members of the opposition as we work through the transition toward free and fair elections			2
" @entity4 lawmakers have also chimed in , with foreign policy veterans sens. @entity165 , @entity166 , and @entity167 , @entity168 , among those calling for @entity16 to step aside for the sake of his country and people			1
thursday night , the @entity173 gave unanimous approval to a resolution calling for @entity16 to " immediately begin an orderly and peaceful transition to a democratic political system , including the transfer of power to an inclusive interim caretaker government , in coordination with leaders from @entity8 's opposition , civil society , and military , to enact the necessary reforms to hold free , fair , and internationally credible elections this year			1
" the @entity14 administration also sharply condemned the violence that erupted wednesday in @entity190 , when @entity192 supporters attacked anti-government protesters			0
at least eight people were killed and 836 injured , according to the @entity195			0
@entity66 spokesman @entity196 said thursday " elements close to the government or ruling party " carried out the violence			0
" i do n't think we have a sense of how far up the chain it went , " he noted			0
the @entity4 continues to walk a fine diplomatic line in the crisis , encouraging @entity16 to transition from power while stopping short of publicly asking him to step down			1
officials say the restraint is needed because the @entity94 is mindful that allies in the @entity210 are concerned about @entity4 loyalty			2
government contacts have expressed reservations about how vocal the @entity14 administration has been in pressing @entity16 , a close @entity4 ally of three decades			1
other regional allies are concerned about how quickly the @entity4 might turn on them if protests start in their countries , the @entity66 officials said			2
the @entity94 , meanwhile , has made a deliberate decision to let adm. @entity220 , chairman of the @entity221 , take the lead role in communicating with the @entity8 military about its role in the current unrest , according to two senior @entity4 officials			1
@entity220 has not told @entity8 military leaders to pressure @entity16 to step down , the officials insisted to @entity1			1
" that 's not his role , " one official said			0
@entity220 is , however , trying to push the @entity8 military to maintain security , not move against peaceful protesters , and keep the violence from escalating			2
the @entity4 government believes @entity16 will not issue a direct order to the @entity8 army to do anything because he is uncertain his orders would be followed , one official with very direct knowledge of evolving @entity4 policy in the crisis told @entity1			1
a refusal on the part of the army to obey @entity16 would spell the end of the @entity8 leader 's rule , the official noted			1
at that point , @entity16 would have to leave the country			0
the @entity4 belief right now , the official said , is that @entity76 is letting the army feel it is " representing the flag of the nation " in trying to help without making a massive move against the government			1
while @entity220 is communicating with his @entity8 counterparts , the @entity260 has set up its own task force to monitor the crisis			0
" the @entity260 always surges personnel and resources as needed to meet any crisis head - on			0
this situation is no different , and we 've established a @entity210 @entity270 , " @entity260 spokeswoman @entity267 said			0
" our 24/7 operations are focused on ensuring we provide the best possible insights and freshest intelligence to policymakers , " she said			0
the chaotic situation has raised concerns that terrorist entities could try to exploit the situation			0
" people are watching for signs that terrorists or militant groups might try to take advantage of the situation in @entity190 and launch attacks , " a @entity4 official noted			2
" we expect groups like @entity288 to take advantage of instability anywhere as a means to promote their cause publicly			0
" overall , the @entity14 administration is handling the @entity8 crisis relatively well so far , according to @entity295 , a former @entity296 @entity66 official			2
" we 've got to stand up , as the president is doing , for reform and democracy , " @entity295 told @entity1			0
the @entity4 government needs to " use our influence behind the scenes , and we 've got a lot of influence there with president @entity16 to move him towards a fast transition			1
" @entity295 noted the importance of @entity8 in terms of the @entity311 - @entity310 conflict , shipments through the @entity313 , and the containment of @entity315 , among other things			0
" we 've got to preserve those very real @entity4 interests , " he said			0
" this is about as difficult a challenge diplomatically as i think we have seen in many years			0
" @entity320 , an analyst at the conservative @entity321 , said that while it 's " tempting to try to score political points " in the current crisis , he 's not sure @entity14 has responded any differently than a @entity326 president would have in a similar situation			0
in terms of backing @entity16 , all of @entity14 's predecessors " kicked the can down the road until the road ran out , " he said			2
the real difficulty , @entity320 said , will come in the months ahead as @entity4 policymakers try to prevent @entity8 from following the path @entity315 took after 1979 , when the fall of @entity338 led to the rise of the fundamentalist regime still in power today			2
the @entity4 needs to make clear the @entity8 elections happen " come hell or high water , " @entity320 said , but at the same pushing to ensure armed extremist militias are n't allowed to claim the mantle of democratic legitimacy			2
@entity1 's @entity348 , @entity349 , @entity350 , @entity351 , @entity352 , @entity353 , @entity354 , @entity355 and @entity356 contributed to this report .			0
