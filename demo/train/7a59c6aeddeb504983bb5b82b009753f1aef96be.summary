@entity0 -- these will be the @entity3 , to many they will be the austerity games -- and they may even be the rain @entity3			1
the long wait will be over friday for @entity0 , the city that was awarded the @entity7 in 2005 on a promise of transformation			1
a day after that announcement , suicide bombers struck @entity0 trains and buses , killing 52 people			0
seven years on and a security staffing fiasco has again thrust potential threats to the forefront of people 's minds -- but @entity21 organizers and the government say they will do everything possible to keep the @entity3 safe			1
while @entity25 's wettest june in more than a century may have cast a cloud over the final preparations for the @entity3 , forecasters say the weather is now set to brighten			1
and as more than 10,000 athletes from 205 countries assemble in @entity0 for friday 's opening ceremony , there is the promise of two weeks of breathtaking sport			1
can @entity36 sprinter @entity35 , star of the @entity38 track in 2008 , win gold once again in the men 's 100m , 200m and 4 x 100m relay events , thus cementing his status as the fastest man on the planet ? read why all the top sprinters come from @entity36 many wonder if @entity48 men 's basketball squad can surpass the on - court magic of the legendary @entity50 at the 1992 @entity51			1
and as swimmers race beneath the sweeping curves of the @entity55 , the pressure will be on @entity57 @entity56 to replicate his success in the last @entity59 , when he took home a record - breaking eight golds			1
meanwhile the host nation 's best hopes of gold medals may lie with @entity66 's stars in sailing , rowing and cycling , including @entity70 , buoyed by an outstanding performance in the @entity73 cycle race			0
every country will have at least one female athlete after @entity76 included two women in its team for the first time , setting an important precedent for women 's rights			0
other athletes have survived the turmoil of the @entity84 to represent their countries for the first time free from the tyranny of dictatorship			0
read how @entity21 athletes rose from the turmoil of the @entity84 and with medals to be handed out in 26 different sports , there 's always the chance of a shock upset or the emergence of a shining new talent to captivate the crowds			0
much of the drama will play out within the landscaped contours of the @entity100 , intended as an enduring sporting legacy in some of the city 's poorest neighborhoods and touted by the @entity7 organizers as the most sustainable space yet designed for the @entity3			1
the 80,000 - capacity @entity106 is built from only a tenth of the total steel used for the @entity110 in @entity38 in 2008 , while in the velodrome cyclists will race round a track made from sustainably - sourced @entity114 pine			1
the organizers are keen to make sure the " green " theme continues beyond the @entity3 ' conclusion on august 12			2
following a clean - up of the @entity119 and canals that pass through the site , wildlife is being encouraged to return to wetlands downstream			2
some 300,000 wetland plants have been planted , as well as more than 4,000 trees and 130,000 plants and bulbs in 250 acres of regenerated parkland			0
@entity129 , head of sustainability for the @entity0 organizing committee , @entity131 , said the event would be a golden opportunity to show what can be achieved			0
" if you can put sustainability at the heart of a project which is the largest logistical exercise in peace time -- across 26 different sports , with thousands of people attending and millions watching -- then you can do it anywhere , " @entity129 told @entity1			0
much of the cost of staging the @entity21 and @entity143 has been met by the taxpayer , with the government overseeing Â £ 9.3 billion ( $ 14.5 billion ) of spending from the public purse			0
according to its figures , three - quarters of the money spent by the @entity150 -- the public sector body responsible for building the new venues and infrastructure -- has been invested in long - term regeneration , and the @entity3 are currently under budget by some Â £ 476 million			2
the organizing group @entity131 , which is a private company , has a core budget of more than Â £ 2 billion ( $ 3.1 billion ) , with almost all revenue raised from the private sector , it says			0
by contrast , the @entity163 in 2008 cost a whopping $ 40 billion , according to a december 2008 report by the state - run news agency @entity166			2
@entity168 spent heavily on infrastructure , including three new subway lines , a new airport terminal and new sports facilities , the news agency said			0
watch how the @entity21 spirit is still strong in @entity38 @entity0 's games come in the wake of the global financial meltdown and against a backdrop of economic gloom in @entity179 and broad cuts to public spending in @entity25			0
but many will put aside such worries on friday night , when crowds flock to the @entity106 for the much - anticipated opening ceremony , dubbed " @entity189 " and inspired by @entity187 's play " @entity188			1
" in the event the heavens do n't open on the night , director @entity190 , the @entity191 - winning director of " @entity192 , " has lined up fake clouds to shade his stage set of rolling @entity25 countryside , a pastoral vision that will include real farmyard animals -- not least 70 sheep with three sheepdogs to keep them in check			2
@entity21 organizers predict more than a billion people worldwide will tune in to watch the spectacle on tv			2
another side to @entity0 will come into view with the beach volleyball , to be played against the backdrop of the historic @entity211 , and the tennis at the @entity213 , home of the venerable @entity214			0
how are you celebrating the @entity59 ? send ireport your stories , video but while @entity0 , a bustling city of more than 8 million people , is front and center of the @entity221 , it is not alone in hosting what will be @entity25 's third @entity59 , after previous occasions in 1908 and 1948			1
@entity224 in @entity225 , just outside the capital , is the lake where rowers will push the boundaries of pain as they seek to bring home the gold			0
the testing waters of @entity233 , on the @entity235 coast , will be alive with the brightly - colored sails of yachts , dinghies and windsurfers			2
sites in @entity241 and @entity242 , also near @entity0 , will host canoeing and mountain biking , and @entity21 football matches will be played at grounds as far afield as @entity247 in @entity248 and the @entity249 in @entity250 , before the final at the iconic @entity252 in @entity0			0
the challenges of policing such a high - profile and sprawling event , which follows on the heels of @entity258 's rain - lashed @entity257 celebrations and precedes the @entity143 , are significant			1
a chorus of leading figures , from home secretary @entity262 to @entity131 chairman @entity263 , have stepped up to reassure visitors that a shortfall in recruiting security guards by contractor @entity267 will not impact on safety			1
the sight of thousands of soldiers deployed on the streets of @entity0 and elsewhere to support the security effort will be unusual but , organizers likely hope , reassuring to those at @entity21 venues and transport hubs			1
@entity0 's @entity278 , known as the @entity278 , is undertaking what it says is its biggest - ever peacetime operation , running for 66 days over 1,000 venues , including sporting and cultural events , and making use of up to 9,500 police officers on the busiest days			2
read how @entity0 faces security questions ahead of the @entity59 away from the venues , the @entity278 will also have to provide the usual policing for the city and its visitors			1
few @entity291 will forget that the @entity3 come just a year after the capital was rocked by outbreaks of rioting and looting			0
at the same time , those athletes for whom @entity0 is home , such as runners @entity297 and @entity299 , will surely draw a special inspiration from the support of their crowded , diverse city			0
the @entity21 torch , which arrived in @entity0 a week ahead of the @entity3 , is being carried through the city 's streets by almost 1,000 people on the last leg of its 8,000 mile , 70 - day journey to the opening ceremony			1
when the last torchbearer carries the flame into the @entity106 on friday , millions of eyes around the world will watch as the cauldron is lit -- a symbol of the hopes and sporting passions that will play out over the next 16 days			2
and while not everyone in @entity25 is overjoyed about the @entity59 -- some @entity291 seeing it as an inconvenience , others as an expensive luxury at a time of austerity -- surely there will be few who wo n't cross their fingers for no rain on that parade			1
