-- @entity1 stand - in coach @entity2 suffered another agonizing display on his competitive return to the stadium that effectively ended his playing career			0
twenty - four years on from suffering a cruciate ligament injury while playing for @entity1 in the @entity10 , that same old sinking feeling returned for a man holding the reins as regular coach @entity13 undergoes medical treatment for a tumor in @entity16			0
fielding a strong side against a @entity19 team that failed to beat the @entity20 in last season 's four @entity22 meetings , @entity1 lost the first leg of the last 16 clash 2 - 0			1
after a tight first half , @entity26 broke the deadlock after 56 minutes when drilling home from the edge of the box after a @entity33 drive was deflected into his path			1
nine minutes from time , fellow @entity36 @entity35 sealed @entity19 's first @entity22 win over @entity1 in 13 years after he stylishly finished off a sweeping move involving @entity39 and new signing @entity40			1
the victory was especially satisfying for the @entity19 hierarchy and club president @entity44 , who may hope the unexpected win represents a good omen as the 76 - year - old tries to return to office in this weekend 's @entity51 elections			1
following last year 's comprehensive 3 - 1 aggregate defeat against @entity53 and colleagues in the @entity22 quarterfinals , @entity19 overhauled their squad -- with @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 among those moved on			1
a total of eleven players who took part in the 2012 clashes were sold , reducing the average age of the squad from 30 to 27 , and the team has slowly overcome a difficult bedding - in period to rise up to fourth in @entity70 @entity19 coach @entity71 had spoken of the need before the game to find a way of blunting @entity1 's attacking threat and his plan worked to perfection thanks to the on - field discipline of his players			1
" we played as a team and we listened to our coach , " said @entity35 , whose goal was his first ever in the @entity22			0
" he did a fantastic job by setting us up us very well on the pitch -- and we were very disciplined and managed to close every angle			0
" @entity87 : send in your questions for @entity90 even though @entity19 are seven - time @entity92 champions , their tally second only to the nine of @entity1 's great rivals @entity95 , exuberant celebrations spread out across the stadium as the four - time winners fell without scoring an away goal			2
@entity2 has never made any claims to wanting to be a permanent coach and he suffered in @entity19 where the home side 's impressive defensive discipline smothered the usual attacking prowess of a side standing 12 points clear in the @entity20 league			2
his side were unable to formulate an alternative to their usual fluent style until the stand - in coach chose to use defender @entity113 in a makeshift attacking role for the final minutes			0
mustering barely a shot on target worthy of the name , @entity1 's limp display -- with @entity53 's impact wholly minimized by some efficient defending -- must have made @entity2 , 45 , wish he could never return to the @entity10 in a competitive capacity again			0
in 1989 , he was an aspiring @entity1 midfielder when the then 22 - year - old suffered a serious knee against @entity19 in the @entity123 - an injury that would bring his career to a premature end four years later			2
his side are now in danger of failing to reach the @entity22 semifinals for the first time in six years and @entity13 may discover that his team is out of the competition when he returns to the fray in late march			0
elsewhere , @entity133 fielded both major january signings -- @entity135 and @entity136 -- in their home clash with @entity139 but were held to a disappointing 1 - 1 draw			1
the hosts appeared to have made the perfect start when @entity143 slammed home a fine individual goal after 12 minutes , with the striker now having scored seven of @entity133 's 8 @entity22 goals this term			2
that was as good as it got for the home side , with @entity153 leveling the scores shortly before halftime as the visitors finished the game the stronger .			0

@entity19 win 2 - 0 in first leg of last 16 tie to stun *tournament* favorites
@entity36 *duo* @entity26 and @entity35 fired home in second half
@entity166 @entity133 held 1 - 1 at home by @entity139 despite fielding @entity135 and @entity136
