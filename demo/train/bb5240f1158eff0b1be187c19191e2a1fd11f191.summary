@entity0 -- @entity3 prime minister @entity2 and his right - wing @entity5 party have agreed to form a unity government with the rival centrist political faction @entity8 in a move that will put off elections until late next year and create one of the largest coalition governments in @entity3 history			1
the deal was reached early tuesday morning between @entity2 and @entity8 leader @entity15 , a day after @entity2 had publicly called for early elections to be held september 4			1
appearing together at a news conference tuesday afternoon in the @entity19 , the two leaders attempted to explain the sudden change in direction			2
" when i thought the stability is rocking i was willing to go to elections , " @entity2 said			1
" but when i found out that it is possible to create a broad , very broad government ... i understood that we can bring back the state of stability without changing the time of elections			2
" @entity15 characterized the agreement as an " historic opportunity " for the government to put the public good before narrow political concerns			0
both men said that the new coalition , made up of 94 of 120 @entity19 members , would be better capable of addressing a variety of domestic and security concerns			0
the agreement calls for @entity15 to enter the government as a deputy prime minister and offers a number of @entity8 members senior @entity19 committee positions			0
@entity8 will be given a leading role in redrafting a controversial law that provides an exemption for compulsory military service to ultra-orthodox men in @entity3			2
political disagreement over the sensitive issue was one of the major factors leading @entity2 to push for early elections in september			1
both men also identified upcoming budget negotiations , government reform and the need to restart talks with @entity60 as the most important goals of the new government			0
the unexpected move by @entity2 upends the political calculations of smaller left - of - center parties and provides him with a comfortable governing coalition less sensitive to the demands of his current right - wing coalition partners			0
for @entity15 and his fellow @entity8 members , the move buys another year in office without having to face voters amid sagging popularity ratings			0
what impact the new coalition could have on @entity3 's handling of @entity78 's nuclear program is not entirely clear			1
while a stable and unified @entity3 government sends a strong signal to leaders in @entity82 , @entity15 , a former military chief - of - staff and defense minister , has generally been less hawkish on @entity78 than @entity2 and has expressed reservations about @entity3 taking unilateral military action against the @entity88 's nuclear installations			1
" this is not going to lead to a major change of policy on @entity78 , " says @entity89 , an @entity78 expert at the @entity90 in @entity91			1
" this is far more about domestic politics than @entity78 , " @entity89 said , adding , " any decisions on @entity78 still depended greatly on the @entity96 " rather than a new governing coalition			0
the @entity19 is likely to endorse the new coalition deal in the next two days .			0

the deal is reached early tuesday morning
the deal comes as @entity2 called for early elections
" @entity107 restores stability , " @entity2 says
it may also change @entity3 's stance with @entity78
