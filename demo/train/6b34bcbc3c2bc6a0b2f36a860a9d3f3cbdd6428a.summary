the bodies of the victims are being buried			0
the court case will continue , without cameras			0
the horror in @entity5 has faded from the front page in favor of @entity9 coverage			0
so it is worth asking , 10 days after the largest mass shooting in @entity13 history , whether it is still too soon to start a conversation about reasonable gun restrictions			1
what actions could we take to make such slaughters more difficult to perpetrate ? because if it is true , as the @entity22 says , that " guns do n't kill people ; people kill people , " then it 's equally irrefutable that people with guns kill people			1
here is the toll , beyond the 12 dead and 59 wounded in @entity5			0
more than 180 people killed in mass shootings in the past five years , including the 32 people who died in the april , 2007 massacre at @entity37 and dwarfing that total are the @entity39 murdered by gunshots every year			1
@entity41 : time to face facts on gun control no one is suggesting that insane actions such as the @entity47 shootings can ever be legislated out of existence			1
and there is no doubt that the @entity51 is enshrined in our @entity52			0
but part of life in a civil society is about having civic conversations about problems -- not aiming for the illusion of perfectibility but for improvement			0
@entity63 2012 , however , it has become politically incorrect to talk about restricting the ability of unstable individuals to get @entity67 rifles , or 6,000 rounds of ammunition			2
when people say " it 's too soon " to talk about the role of guns in mass shootings , what too many of them really mean is that we should never have the conversation			1
gun violence is not inevitable			2
it does not reflect the human condition			0
@entity82 : guns endanger cops ' safety @entity13 leads the world in gun violence by many multiples			1
it reflects our culture -- and guns are a core part of @entity13 culture , for better or worse			2
it is a fact rooted in the conquest of the @entity97 , where guns were used primarily for hunting and self - defense			2
and @entity13 ' divergent views about guns are reflected in something more fundamental than politics			2
in a larger sense , @entity13 's political divides are not rooted in questions of left versus right as much as urban versus rural			2
these basic cultural differences have been the drivers of political debates since @entity109 squared off against @entity110 in @entity112 's @entity111			2
they were reflected in debates over the @entity114 and @entity115 and today 's red state versus blue state divides			2
and they underscore the different opinions that exist about guns			2
we use guns differently in rural and urban areas of the @entity13			2
and because @entity124 need to expand their base beyond urban areas to win statewide or national elections , they have ceded this ground to @entity129			0
this new status quo is enforced on @entity131 by the fact that the @entity22 outspends anti-gun advocacy groups such as the @entity134 by a factor of 10 - to - 1 , making it all too easy for members of @entity137 to calculate that taking on -- or even talking about -- this issue is n't worth the cost			1
and it is even more true at the presidential level			0
president @entity142 was eloquent and empathetic after meeting with victims and their families , but he backed off making any proposals for new gun control laws			1
@entity147 also was quick to cite scripture and communicate his sorrow in the hours after the attacks , but he was firm in his insistence that no new guns laws were needed			0
gun violence and gun laws seem oddly and unrealistically disconnected when it comes to political discussion			0
@entity157 : @entity158 drives opposition to gun control what 's particularly hypocritical about these stands is that both men backed assault weapons bans in the past			1
as governor of @entity167 , @entity147 signed an assault weapons ban into law			0
as a candidate for president , @entity142 said he would push for a restoration of the assault weapons ban achieved by president @entity174 but which expired in 2004			0
presumably , what 's changed is not their personal beliefs but the politics			0
@entity147 did a signature flip - flop on this social issue because no @entity129 believes they can win their party 's nomination without full genuflection at the altar of the @entity22			1
@entity142 's position can also be ascribed to presidential politics -- the @entity142 campaign ca n't afford to lose a single persuadable vote in swing states such as @entity47 , @entity191 and @entity192			1
moreover , @entity142 's stance on guns is complicated by the typical competition between fear - mongering and facts			1
despite the fact that @entity142 has in some cases loosened gun laws -- such as signing legislation allowing people to carry firearms into national parks -- the far right has been pushing the fright - wing fantasy that he is hell - bent on banning all guns via a @entity208 small - arms treaty or some other nefarious plot			1
but the conventional wisdom in @entity112 -- that this is a settled debate -- is a fiction			0
a new poll by the @entity129 pollster @entity212 for @entity213 found that : -- 74 % of @entity22 members and 87 % of @entity217 gun owners support criminal background checks for anyone purchasing a gun			1
-- 74 % of @entity22 members think that concealed carry permits should be granted only to applicants who have completed gun safety training and 75 % believe that such permits should be granted to people who have not committed violent misdemeanors , including assault			1
-- in addition , 71 % of @entity22 members back the idea that people on terror watch lists should be barred from buying guns ( duh ) , and 65 % believe that gun owners should be required to alert police in the event of lost and stolen guns			1
opinion : gun control or carry permits wo n't stop mass murder the point is that there is plenty of room for discussion on gun policy @entity247 and plenty of room for defining the common ground around reasonable restrictions that gun - owners and advocates can agree on			1
this is not settled policy and not the third - rail politicians pretend it is			0
that narrative is unrelated to the facts			0
there is no reason we ca n't increase background checks , ban people on a terrorist watch list from buying guns and make it more difficult for people to buy 100 - drum magazines that have no function except to kill as many people as possible as fast as possible			0
this all falls under common sense and the kind of reasonable restrictions set out by the @entity276 in their @entity278 decision			1
having this civic conversation is a rational response to a mass killing -- it can be done respectfully and thoughtfully and well within the realm of " reasonable restrictions " that do not impede on the @entity51			1
all that is required is political courage -- and that can be encouraged by speaking up			0

@entity291 : the view that it 's too soon after @entity47 to talk about gun control is wrong
he says politicians are making a mistake by *ducking* action on the issue
a new poll of @entity22 members shows support for reasonable restrictions on guns , he says
@entity291 : nearly *10,000* are murdered by gunshots each year ; that must be reduced
