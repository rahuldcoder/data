-- about a year after the 2005 @entity4 bombings , right - wing @entity2 journalist @entity1 published a book that she called " @entity6			1
" it was an extended lament about what she called the decline of @entity2 values and the destructive consequences of multiculturalism			1
@entity14 security agencies and others began to call the @entity2 capital londonistan -- and only partly in jest			1
@entity4 , one of the great cities of the world that transcend nationality , had attracted dissidents from many countries , but particularly from @entity25 states that might have treated them harshly had they dared to voice their opposition to the ruling cliques at home			0
the @entity6 label was meant to draw a parallel between what was happening in @entity4 and what had happened in @entity33 , where many opponents of the regimes of muslim majority countries had congregated , first to join a war against the @entity39 occupation , and then to fight a broader enemy			0
now , @entity41 has written a similar article in the most recent edition of @entity44 , a well - respected @entity2 periodical , following the gruesome killing in @entity47 of the @entity14 journalist @entity48 , apparently by a @entity2 member of @entity50			1
@entity41 argues that the nationality of the executioner should come as no surprise , given the misguided tolerance of extremism in @entity2			1
it is true that @entity2 citizens have taken part in terrorist attacks , or attempted to , since the rise of global terrorism in the 1990s			1
but to suggest that @entity48 's beheading was somehow related to the laxness or timidity of the @entity2 security authorities , or a decline of the @entity2 state more generally , is going too far			1
it is also the wrong way to look at the problem			0
@entity2 , like the @entity14 , has a well - deserved reputation for acting in accordance with the rule of law			1
and by and large , @entity2 justice is fair and impartial			1
that is surely one of the reasons why so many people have tried to enter the country			0
those who have faced persecution at home have found the freedoms of expression and assembly denied them elsewhere available in every corner of @entity4 and other @entity2 cities			1
and @entity2 life has been enriched by their presence			1
certainly it 's led to social tensions			2
new communities establish traditions that the original population finds strange and even threatening			0
immigrants seem to keep themselves apart and are prepared to work longer for less			2
originally the government aimed to assimilate these newcomers , but realized that defining " @entity100 " was hard enough for the @entity2 , let alone a concept that a new arrival could understand			1
integration became the new objective , but this too is difficult in a society that 's under strain and believes the best policy is a clear set of rules that still allow people to find their own way within them			2
committing terrorist acts is not within the rules			2
and recent @entity2 legislation has tried to set firmer and clearer rules that make plotting terrorist acts a crime -- however hard it may be to identify a crime before it has been committed			1
this may help to deter and prevent terrorism , or it may not			0
it is always hard to measure what did not happen as a result of government action			0
the best way to deter terrorism is not to introduce ever - more draconian laws -- which inevitably miss their targets but affect everyone else -- but to continue to hold true to the values that terrorists seek to challenge			1
in the dark world of the self - described @entity134 , the law and its implementation are arbitrarily applied by those who hold the guns			2
there is no appeal against them			0
it is a world of intimidation and dictatorship , similar to but worse than the totalitarian states established by @entity146 and @entity147			0
some @entity2 people may feel alienated from society in the @entity2 ; they may believe that they lack opportunity			2
but they are lucky to have the opportunity to say so , and to advocate for change			0
they would not have that in the " @entity134			0
" they would be dead			0
@entity2 people may have gone to join the " @entity134 ' " hoping to find a new sense of purpose and self - expression , and perhaps the @entity2 fighters associated with @entity48 's death believe they have succeeded			1
but they are not the product of the @entity2			2
they are the product of something far deeper , rooted in the evolution of their own societies and the transitional period between immigrant parents and integrated children			0
if society is not fluid , and does not accept the rough ride that fluidity can bring , it will not move forward			0
@entity176 , as expressed by @entity48 's executioner , is reactionary and backward looking			1
it offers nothing to anyone			0
the " @entity134 " will never attract support from more than the handful of people who run it , and of the few hundred @entity2 people who may think it offers @entity185 and have gone to join in , i predict that the great majority will sooner or later look back at what they left and wish they were still there , however imperfect the conditions			2
@entity191 comes at a price , but it is what we are fighting for as we combat the " @entity134			0

@entity2 's tolerance of extremism leads to acts like @entity48 's beheading , article suggests
@entity203 says that view goes too far and more draconian laws are *n't* the answer
@entity203 : extremism is linked to immigrants ' societies and their transition to integration
he says @entity2 rule of law and freedom of expression will win over allure of @entity50
