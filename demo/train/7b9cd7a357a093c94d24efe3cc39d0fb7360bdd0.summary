-- @entity2 coach @entity1 has urged his players to focus on football rather than the political tensions surrounding his side 's @entity7 quarterfinal against @entity9 in @entity10 friday			1
both nations are at the heart of the @entity14 debt crisis and @entity16 chancellor @entity15 is an unpopular figure in @entity2 over her calls to maintain tough austerity measures in return for financial aid from her country			1
" look , the situation has affected us , " @entity1 told @entity0			1
" the players have family , they have friends , and they worry about what is going on			2
i would say @entity2 is going through more than just a political or economic crisis			1
there is a social crisis with a lot of unemployment			1
the players are human beings and they feel that			0
" what i have asked them to do is to try to forget about that when they play and to focus just on football to show they are real fighters			1
" when @entity2 unexpectedly reached the last eight with a 1 - 0 win over @entity48 , a day before key elections which saw a narrow victory for @entity52 party @entity51 , @entity45 newspapers were quick to link friday 's game with the country 's economic turmoil and strained relations with @entity9			1
" this is how your debtors qualify , @entity15 get ready , " ran the headline in @entity58			0
" bring us @entity15 ! " said @entity61			0
but @entity1 told @entity0 that his players had to keep their emotions in check against @entity9			1
" as far as the players are concerned , they can have extra motivation and more passion in this game against @entity9 but they ca n't lose focus , " he said			1
" we need to think during this game , and if we are led just by our hearts and our emotions , we will be in trouble			0
" @entity16 coach @entity75 is also trying to keep politics out of the last - eight clash as his side bid to bag a first major trophy since @entity80			2
" @entity15 and the national team are on very good terms , " @entity75 told a press conference earlier this week			0
" we have reached an agreement where she does n't interfere with my tactical instructions and , in return , i do n't deal with her political agenda			0
" as far as we are concerned , we are approaching a normal football contest and that is the end of it			2
" @entity90 success @entity1 ' men have already shown the fighting qualities which marked @entity2 's surprise triumph at @entity90 , snatching an unlikely qualification after winning a single point in their opening two games			1
but the 57 - year - old @entity99 , who replaced @entity16 coach @entity100 in 2010 , is not surprised by the team 's passage to the knockout stages			2
" i always believed we could make it out of the group , " @entity1 said			2
" even after our first two games did n't go well i still had faith because i know this team very well and the players always do well in situations of adversity			0
" but can they beat one of the favorites for the competition and go on to repeat that 2004 success ? " we all believe we can beat @entity9 , why not ? we have our weapons as well and if we use them to our advantage we can make our dream of advancing to the next stage come true , " he said			2
" sometimes history can repeat itself			0
we have to keep dreaming and believing we can make history repeat itself			0
" @entity9 favorites one of the major obstacles to @entity2 progressing is the suspension of their captain and key midfielder @entity130 , who scored the only goal of the match against @entity48			1
@entity1 admits his absence friday is a " big blow			1
" but he added : " we ca n't forget our strength is in our group not just on one player , so we will find a way to be successful without him			0
" @entity9 go into the match in the @entity142 port city as clear favorites , having won the so - called " @entity145 " with a 100 % record			2
but they needed a late winner to beat @entity147 2 - 1 , and @entity75 was unhappy with some aspects of their performance			0
" we left a few enormous gaps in midfield for the opponent to exploit and i did n't like that			0
the solutions are just as clear as the challenges			0
