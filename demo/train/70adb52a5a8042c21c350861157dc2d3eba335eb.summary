@entity0 -- @entity3 prime minister @entity2 agreed to put the brakes on plans for a mall on a park in @entity0 for now , a compromise of sorts to end the two weeks of persistent unrest across the nation			1
the government will keep construction plans on hold until a court considers the objections of protesters camped out in the @entity19 's @entity18 , officials say , if a judicial ruling is not in line with what @entity26 protesters want , a plebiscite on the park will be held			1
@entity2 also will investigate claims of excessive use of force by police -- a major concern of the citizenry			1
this comes after leaders of the protests in @entity0 's @entity19 met last night with @entity2 at his home in @entity38 , the capital -- an event regarded as a sign of reconciliation between the government and the protesters			1
the protesters -- part of a @entity48 coalition -- were pleased : " this is just the beginning , resistance will continue , " protesters chanted at a meeting in @entity0			1
@entity2 , in a speech broadcast on tv friday , called on people camped in @entity18 to withdraw			1
" we say please , come now and withdraw from @entity18 , go to your homes			1
and if those from those illegal organizations remain there , then we will be left face - to - face with them			0
because that @entity18 is not a park of this illegal organization , these occupying organizations			1
it belongs to the whole of @entity0 and whole of the nation , and everyone should be able to benefit and enjoy this @entity18 easily			1
" the sit - in against the development served as a symbolic stance against what many perceived as creeping infringement of rights in a secular society			0
people protested plans to bulldoze @entity18 and replace it with a shopping mall housed inside a replica of a 19th - century @entity82 barracks			1
what was a small protest broadened into an outpouring in the square and throughout the country as security forces cracked down hard on demonstrators			0
the images , seen worldwide on social media and tv , sparked criticism in world capitals as well as @entity3 itself -- a @entity94 member and a @entity97 ally			0
the unrest also signaled political danger for @entity2 -- a popular , populist , and democratically elected politician serving his third term in office			1
@entity2 has been criticized for heavy handed tactics , even among his allies , and for trying to impose developments without popular public input			1
the park plan is the final straw for many @entity109 , who think the government is intent on imposing its will whenever and wherever it wants			0
the criticism has been a blow to @entity2 and his @entity115 - rooted party , which has overseen an economic boom in the country over the past decade			1
his actions have buoyed the secular opposition -- the one - time powerful demographic that feels marginalized by @entity2 's @entity114 , the @entity114			1
but despite @entity2 's tough rhetoric toward protesters , he and his government appear to be hearing the diverse voices in @entity19 and other squares across @entity3			1
he mocked what he saw as the protesters ' lack of cleanliness and rowdiness and warned those people camped out in the park and the square to leave			1
after the meeting , @entity134 , deputy chairman of the @entity114 , told reporters in @entity38 on friday that @entity18 would be kept untouched until the court 's decision			2
" a plebiscite will be held to sound @entity0 people out to determine what they want and do not want			2
we will definitely respect the final decision of the people of @entity0 no matter what the outcome will be			2
our government will undoubtedly implement the decision of @entity0 people			0
" @entity149 , a city planner speaking on behalf of the @entity48 protest movement , thanked @entity2 and his ministers for accepting their demands for a meeting			2
he said @entity2 said the government would implement the final result of a plebiscite across @entity0 and investigate police behavior			2
" we will closely follow his promises and the process			0
unfortunately four people died in the incidents			0
we still feel the pain of their death			0
we will organize an activity in @entity18 tomorrow , a commemoration for the dead as a lament and expression of deep sorrow , " @entity149 said			2
@entity48 is a coalition of protesters that comprises dentists , pharmacists , engineers and other educated secularists			2
the government wants the protesters to leave @entity19 , but there is no single organization or person capable of getting everyone to pack up and go			2
many groups in @entity19 and some -- such as the @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185 -- have already vowed to hunker down in the park			0
in @entity0 later , protesters stressed the importance of the police brutality issue , with one official saying their attacks " trampled all human dignity			0
" that issue was hit home strongly during the meeting			0
protesters said @entity2 did n't respond to demands that those detained should be freed and stripped of charges and that central squares across the country be opened for freedom of speech and expression			1
earlier this week , many activists had backed out of a meeting with @entity2 out of anger over the tear gas against demonstrators by police this week			2
after two weeks of raucous anti-government street protests , calm settled over @entity0 for a second day friday as the city prepared for pro-government counter demonstrations			0
@entity2 's party has organized counter protests for the weekend to give a voice to @entity3 's " quiet majority to the people and the world , " he said			1
they will show the international community " a real , true picture of @entity3			0
" two rallies will be held away from anti-government protests to avoid possible confrontations , he said			0
police in @entity38 launched tear gas at rowdy demonstrators who tried to set up barricades to cut off traffic			0
police released 46 demonstrators detained in the protests , @entity1 sister network @entity230 reported			0
opinion : past and future collide in @entity3 clashes letters from @entity3 , with pride what 's driving unrest and protests in @entity3 ? @entity1 's @entity241 reported from @entity0			0
@entity242 and @entity243 reported and wrote from @entity244			0

@entity2 urges people to leave @entity18
