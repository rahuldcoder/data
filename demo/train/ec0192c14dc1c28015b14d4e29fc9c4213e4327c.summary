-- a fight over books depicting sex and homosexuality has riled up a small @entity6 city , cost some library board members their positions and prompted a call for a public book burning			1
a washing machine was part of a july 4 parade float made by a group seeking changes at @entity17 's library			1
the battle has stirred much of @entity17 , a city of roughly 30,000 people about 35 miles north of @entity20			2
residents have sparred for months on blogs , airwaves and at meetings , including one where a man told the city 's library director he should be tarred and feathered			1
the row even spread to this year 's @entity30 parade , which included a float featuring a washing machine and a sign that read " keep our library clean			1
" " if you told me we would be going through a book challenge of this nature , i 'd think , ' never in a million years , ' " said @entity37 , director of the @entity38			2
the strife began in february when @entity17 couple @entity44 and @entity45 objected to some of the content in the city library 's young - adult section			1
they later petitioned the library board to move any sexually explicit books -- the definition of which would be debated -- from the young - adult section to the adult section and to label them as sexually explicit			1
@entity45 , 49 , said the books in the section of the library aimed at children aged 12 to 18 included homosexual and heterosexual content she thought was inappropriate for youths			1
she and her husband also asked the library to obtain books about homosexuality that affirmed heterosexuality , such as titles written by " ex-gays , " @entity45 said			1
" all the books in the young - adult zone that deal with homosexuality are gay - affirming			1
that 's not balance , " she said			2
the library did not agree with the @entity77 ' suggestions , and the couple appealed to the library board			1
@entity45 , a mother of four , began blogging about the issue and the local newspaper picked up the dispute , sparking the opposition			2
@entity84 , also a @entity17 mom , set up a rival blog to argue the other side			0
" i 'm against any other party telling me what 's appropriate for my child and what is n't , " said @entity84 , 40 , who also created a @entity88			2
" we do n't mean to say these are appropriate for everyone , but we do n't feel they should be set apart from other materials or restricted from the young - adult section			1
" by this time , many more people had become caught up in the issue , which was generating heat			2
when @entity84 appeared on a local radio , callers attacked her views , she said			0
" people were being very passionate on both sides of the issue			2
i think it divided the community a little bit , " she said			0
with the debate raging , the city council voted in april against renewing the terms of four library board members , in part because council members thought the board was dragging its feet , library director @entity37 said			1
the @entity77 were still fighting to have books moved , having identified 82 questionable titles -- more than double their original list			2
then they stopped targeting a list of books and circulated a petition that asked the board to label and move to the adult section any " youth - targeted pornographic books " -- including books that describe sex acts in a way unsuitable for minors			1
the books could still be checked out freely by anyone			0
" we 're not talking about educational material			0
we 're talking raunchy sex acts , " @entity45 said			0
one book she objects to is " @entity138 , " in which a fictional teenage boy tells about his freshman year in high school , including rape and homosexual and heterosexual sex between teens			0
@entity37 said book excerpts found on @entity45 's blog had been taken out of context and , in the case of " @entity150 , " the criticism missed some of the book 's points			1
" in this book , there were consequences of ... rape , of indiscriminate sex			0
those were not portrayed so glowingly , " he said			0
by the time the library board met on june 2 , each side had collected more than 1,000 signatures backing their position			0
dozens of residents spoke at the meeting before the board -- still including the outgoing members -- unanimously voted to keep all policies the same			0
the demand to move the books was always going to be problematic because no authority has determined that any of the titles are pornographic or obscene , @entity37 said			1
book challenges are n't new			0
more than 500 were reported in the @entity176 in 2008 , mostly in schools and public libraries , @entity174 of the @entity175 said			0
but this one was attracting extra attention			0
@entity174 , who monitored the dispute , said moving any young - adult book to the adult section would have been a form of censorship , even if teens were free to check them out			1
" the whole intent was shelving books not on the basis of age or reading ability , but because they disapprove of the content with the intent of restricting access			0
that 's a burden on first amendment rights , " @entity174 said			0
outside @entity17 , the fight caught the attention of @entity199 , who , with three other @entity20 - area men , filed a claim against @entity17 calling for one of the library 's books to be publicly burned , along with financial damages			1
the four plaintiffs -- who describe themselves as " elderly " in their complaint --- claim their " mental and emotional well - being was damaged by [ the ] book at the library			1
" the claim , unconnected to the @entity212 , says the book " @entity216 " -- a fictional piece about a homosexual teenager -- is " explicitly vulgar , racial and anti-christian			1
" @entity199 , who says he is president of a @entity20 group called the @entity220 , said he singled out the book because it " goes way over the line " with offensive language and descriptions of sex acts			2
the call for burning the book showed his passion , @entity199 , 74 , said			2
" i do n't sit on the fence when i do these things			0
when i make a decision to speak up on something , i go for it			0
" the @entity175 will help the library oppose the claim if it goes forward , @entity174 said , adding she felt that was unlikely because " it has very little basis in law			2
" back in @entity17 , the @entity77 and their supporters are gearing up for another go at the library , in part because the board now has its four new members			0
they do not want books burned , but they do want action			0
" we want parents to decide whether they want their children to have access to these books ... and we want the library 's help in identifying [ them through labeling and moving ] , " @entity45 said			1
" it 's just common sense			0
