-- when renowned economist @entity4 visited rural villages in @entity6 in 2005 , he saw impoverished communities with poor drinking water , feast - and - famine crop cycles and rampant malaria infections			2
what he did n't see was mobile phones			0
" now mobile phone ownership is perhaps 30 % of households and cell phone coverage is widespread , " said @entity4 , director of the @entity12 @entity11 , which focuses on improving 14 rural villages across 10 @entity15 countries as a model for wider prosperity in the region			1
the advent of the mobile society may have brought convenience and a cultural sea change to the @entity27 and @entity28 , but in the poorest regions of the world , affordable mobile phone access has caused a quantum leap in services -- like calling for medical help , sending a quick letter to loved ones or starting a savings account -- that @entity27 and @entity28 have taken for granted for generations , analysts say			1
" the cell phone is the single most transformative technology for development , " said @entity4 , head of the @entity39 at @entity40 and author of the 2005 book " @entity43			1
" " poverty is almost equated with isolation in many places of the world			0
poverty results from the lack of access to markets , to emergency health services , access to education , the ability to take advantage of government services and so on , " @entity4 said			0
" what the mobile phone -- and more generally it technology -- is ending is that kind of isolation in all its different varieties			1
" moreover , the profusion of payment services via cell phones puts places like @entity69 and @entity70 in the vanguard of mobile financial services			1
" you can walk in the middle of rural village in @entity81 and use a mobile phone to pay at a recharging station to recharge led lights , " says @entity73 , acting program manager of @entity75 , a @entity76 - based non-profit organization that is helping to bring more mobile phones to @entity6 's rural poor			1
" i 'm always flabbergasted i do n't walk into @entity86 and see these services here , just swipe your cell phone and go , " @entity85 said			1
" in some ways , they 're really leaping ahead of us and going right to the future			0
" @entity69 's " mobile - money " revolution from 2005 to 2010 , cell phone use tripled in the developing world to nearly 4 billion mobile subscriptions , according to the @entity99 ( @entity99 )			1
nowhere was the growth faster than in @entity6 , which saw mobile use grow more than 400 % during that time frame , according to @entity99			0
that means more money -- a 2006 @entity106 study found that every 10 % increase in cell phone penetration grows the local economy by 0.6 %			2
the simple ability to make a phone call has far - reaching economic consequences , @entity4 said			0
" places where traditionally , people would walk livestock for a week or two without knowing what kind of price they 'll fetch -- should they go to @entity119 , @entity120 or @entity121 ? now they can call ahead and find out where to get the best price , " @entity4 said			0
the low cost of setting up mobile towers and plunging costs of handsets has allowed cell phone coverage to grow even in poor , rural locations , said @entity131 , former ceo of @entity132 , a @entity69 telecom provider which grew from 17,000 users when he started in 2000 to more than 18 million when he stepped down in 2010			1
" there 's probably more pervasive coverage in @entity69 than in many areas in @entity28 , " @entity131 said			2
business models set up for selling services to the poor -- such as buying pre-paid phone service and charging by the second rather than the minute -- made cell phone use affordable , but @entity132 's development of banking services via cell phones revolutionized the telecom business in poor countries			1
@entity132 , in partnership with the @entity150 's @entity149 , started @entity151 ( short for mobile pesa , @entity153 for " money " ) services in 2007 that allow customers to digitally transfer cash via mobile phones			2
two years later , 10 % of the country 's gdp was being circulated through @entity151 , according to a 2010 @entity162 report			0
now @entity69 make $ 1 billion a month in transactions via @entity151 , where cash can be deposited and transferred at one of 20,000 stores , @entity131 said			1
" the growth of @entity159 in @entity69 would be half what it was the past 10 years if it was n't for the mobile phone , " said @entity131			1
" about 70 % of all jobs in @entity69 are in the informal sector -- selling goods on the side of the road , that sort of thing -- and now to start a business all you need is a cell phone , " said @entity131 , who now is a fellow at the @entity162 focusing on mobile money services			1
as a result of @entity151 , more cash is moving -- and staying -- in smaller villages , building up the local economy , said @entity184 , who spent 18 months in @entity69 studying the impact of mobile banking services there			1
" now that money is being delivered locally , they did n't have to physically go to the nearest urban center to get cash , " said @entity184 , who is now working in @entity70 on mobile banking programs for the @entity191 's @entity190 program			2
" i noticed village stores had seen a demand in ' city goods ' -- things you would n't typically get in the villages before like furniture , or a particular hair - straightening product for women			0
mobile apps for poverty cell phone technology has unleashed new ways to help the poor in developing countries , @entity4 said , but businesses have led the way			1
" cell phones are spreading almost entirely on a market basis ... only now are we starting to get the applications for it on the social services side , " @entity4 said			0
" and the genius of prepaid phone cards has made it possible for the poor to gain access to this technology without government involvement ... it 's largely governments stepping out of the way and letting commercial companies come in			2
" @entity132 's mobile banking model is being brought to areas from @entity231 to @entity70			2
the @entity12 @entity232 last month announced a program to bring mobile phone service to 3 million more poor people in @entity6 and @entity236 by 2013			1
mobile technology is now being used in @entity238 to track medication stock levels in rural villages , @entity85 said			0
for the @entity243 villages , the pre-paid mobile card is now being used as a model for pre-paid electrical service			0
" we 're able to do very quick mapping and needs assessments with smartphone with @entity251 capability , " said @entity4 , project director			0
" we can cover an area of assessment in weeks , something that used to take years			0
" " the most powerful thing about cell phones is how it has released money flow incountries that have poor infrastructure and often are in crisis situations , " @entity184 said			0
" it also teaches people terms such as ' pin number ' , ' account ' , and ' transfer , ' these kind of technical foreign terms that serve as a nice transitional toward using financial banking services for the first time			2
people are realizing it 's better than keeping money buried in the ground			0

from 2005 to 2010 , cell phone use tripled in the developing world to 4 billion subscriptions
