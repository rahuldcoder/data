-- whatever the reason for its recent spate of problems , @entity2 's @entity1 wo n't fly again until regulators are satisfied the plane is airworthy			1
reports of fire and smoke have put the focus on the plane 's cutting - edge lithium ion battery systems and grounded the fleet worldwide			1
only 50 @entity15 are in service so far , but the airlines that bought these multimillion dollar aircraft are losing money while they sit on the ground			1
big questions remain : how long will it take to get the @entity1 back in the air ? will travelers feel safe enough to board them ? it 's going to be " a big mess , cost @entity2 a lot of money " and embarrass carriers that fly the 787 , said aviation historian @entity30 , a professor at the @entity31			0
the @entity32 on wednesday ordered an emergency inspection of all @entity35 787s			1
@entity36 is the only @entity35 carrier flying the aircraft , with six in its fleet			1
the airworthiness inspection will address the potential risk of battery fires			0
an in - flight fire aboard any aircraft is among the most dangerous aviation scenarios			1
dreamliner woes explained grounding a plane is rare it 's very rare for the @entity32 to order an entire model of airliner out of service , even for a short time			1
industry observers remember that the agency grounded the entire @entity35 fleet of @entity55 for 37 days in 1979			1
that was after @entity57 crashed at @entity60 's @entity59 airport , killing all 271 people aboard and two others on the ground			0
an @entity65 investigation blamed design vulnerabilities and an engine pylon maintanance procedure			0
" i was just starting my career flying at @entity70 and had just flown out of that airport a few days before , ' said @entity72 , head of the @entity73 and a former commercial pilot			1
" it was a big , beautiful @entity76			0
it was very , very distressing , " several dc - 10s were involved in crashes caused by maintenance , design and other issues in the 1970s and 1980s , spurring doubt about the plane 's safety			2
the last @entity86 - 10 to carry paying passengers flew in 2007			1
the @entity1 , of course , has n't crashed in its 15 months of service and is making its debut during a period of unprecedented @entity35 aviation safety			2
nonetheless , every day that @entity15 are grounded ratchets up the pressure on @entity2 , @entity36 and other airlines that have made commitments to buy the 787s			2
the battery that grounded @entity2 a time frame for flying again so now , @entity2 looks for answers			1
a time frame for getting back in the air is anyone 's guess , but the @entity1 could be " grounded another two weeks or two months , " said @entity103 , a former member of the @entity65 and ex-airline mechanic			1
experts will " figure out what 's wrong , design a fix and build a part to fix it , " said @entity103			2
" it 's not easy			0
" even if @entity2 engineers get lucky and find the answer to the problem now , it might still take at least a couple weeks " to get up and running , " he said			0
with reports of problems continuing to plague the @entity1 , @entity72 said the @entity32 did n't need to take any chances			1
" they 're acting with an abundance of caution , " he said			0
" they 're going to go ahead and be proactive and not have the same situation " as the @entity76			0
growing pains are n't unusual other aircraft , including the @entity126 , have had problems during rollout , said @entity130 professor @entity129 , an aircraft electrical and computer engineer who spent time observing @entity1 development at @entity2 's @entity134 headquarters			1
it 's what often happens when a new aircraft is put into service			1
" i know @entity2 spent a lot of time testing things extensively , " said @entity129			2
" these are very complex systems ... and there may be problems they did n't anticipate			0
it 's one of the most complex commercial aircraft ever			2
" with problems appearing in a forward electrical compartment on wednesday 's @entity148 ( @entity149 ) 787 emergency landing , aviation historian @entity30 , author of " @entity153 as @entity154 : adventure , @entity159 , and @entity160 , " worried the situation is more serious than simply problems confined to the aft electrical bay			0
" it raises the specter of something more systemic and perhaps a defective lithium ion battery , he said			0
the @entity1 relies on electricity to power more functions than previous @entity2 airliners , and that takes a lot of battery power			0
lithium ion batteries replaced the traditional nickel cadmium batteries in the new aircraft			2
lithium ion batteries keep a charge longer than nickel cadmium and weigh less , so the plane can save fuel			0
but there are questions about using lithium ion batteries because they 've never been used on an airliner to the extent that the @entity1 uses them			0
all this regulatory turbulence is part of a painful but necessary process of airline development			2
" that 's aviation , " says airline pilot @entity190 of the aviation blog @entity192			0
" there 's a certain statistical aspect that you 're working with in that nothing is going to happen but the best thing is to take the plane out of service and take a time out			1
" @entity0 's @entity202 contributed to this report .			0

grounding of aircraft model by regulators very rare , experts say
the @entity32 grounded the @entity86 - 10 in 1979 for 37 days
the time line for restoring service is *uncertain* , former airline mechanic says
