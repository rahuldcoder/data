the @entity0 has become one of the latest @entity3 countries to enter the coalition fighting @entity5 , with @entity7 voting friday to endorse @entity0 military engagement in @entity9 through airstrikes			1
the vote came shortly after prime minister @entity13 's speech during the @entity14 in @entity15 on wednesday , in which he emphasized the threat posed by @entity5 to the @entity0 and endorsed military action based on " careful preparation " while saying " no to rushing to join a conflict without a clear plan			1
" in doing so , the @entity0 appears to want to redeem itself after the blunders of the invasion of @entity9 in 2003			1
yet entering the conflict through airstrikes in @entity9 is in itself an indication of the lack of a clear plan on part of the @entity0 in particular and the @entity32 coalition as a whole			1
as it currently stands , the coalition 's plan carries a high risk of backfiring			1
the @entity0 is basing its involvement in @entity9 on the legitimacy granted by the democratically elected @entity9 government 's request for international intervention to aid it in fighting @entity5 , a scenario that can not be duplicated in @entity43			1
but @entity5 has set roots in both @entity43 and @entity9 , and has erased the border between the two countries in areas under its control			1
to limit any action against @entity5 , whether military or otherwise , to @entity9 alone is therefore meaningless			1
focusing on airstrikes as a key method of military engagement is also ineffective			0
@entity5 knew very well that no @entity3 country would want to commit boots on the ground in @entity43 or @entity9 , and prepared to defend itself accordingly			2
before the coalition 's campaign began , @entity5 bases in @entity57 and elsewhere were evacuated and the group 's members went underground			1
the raids that have been conducted to date have led to little actual damage to @entity5 ' military capability , according to one of my informants on the ground there			0
if anything , they have played right into the hands of its strategy			0
this strategy is based on engaging in a defensive , asymmetrical war , which , as the examples of @entity77 and @entity78 have shown , is a good bet for militant groups with limited capabilities confronting larger conventional armies			0
@entity5 also invited military action against it in order to legitimize its narrative of fighting a war against " crusades			0
" this narrative has now been strengthened , especially with many of those killed during the strikes being civilians			0
the more civilians die , the higher the resentment against the coalition , and the more attractive @entity5 becomes to potential recruits			2
airstrikes will not sever people 's ties with @entity5			1
the attraction of @entity5 to its recruits is not merely ideological			0
it is based on seeking revenge for economic , social , and political grievances as well as the pursuit of power and money , but also a sense of belonging to a grand project , which is the establishment of a caliphate			0
now that a @entity110 has been declared , even in rudimentary form , the most airstrikes can achieve is the containment of @entity5 through limiting its ability to expand geographically , but not its eradication			2
without a political and economic plan tackling the motivations driving @entity5 sympathizers within @entity43 and @entity9 and globally , limited military action will keep @entity5 alive and open the door to retaliation			1
with an increasing number of @entity5 jihadists hailing from the @entity0 , @entity0 involvement in the air raid campaign translates into increased threat to @entity0 security			2
the risk of retaliation extends to all countries involved in the @entity131 coalition			0
although the @entity32 coalition has been crystalizing for some time , what it 's pursuing is far from a carefully planned strategy			0
in addition to the risks highlighted above , a glaring gap is a political strategy for @entity43 that would prevent the country from descending into the kind of chaos witnessed in @entity143			0
also absent is a regional security strategy for neighboring countries like @entity147 and the @entity148 , which have entered the coalition nervously and are worried about their own stability now that they are in direct confrontation with @entity5			2
there were several measures -- from diplomatic pressure to strengthening the @entity43 opposition adequately -- that the international community could have taken two years ago , that would have prevented the @entity43 crisis from escalating to the alarming level witnessed today			0
military action as currently planned would have been much more effective back when @entity5 was still in its infancy			0
now that military action is a reality , instead of merely jumping on the bandwagon , the @entity0 should use its position as a major @entity167 country and a key ally of the @entity169 to push the coalition towards formulating a long - term strategy that is indeed comprehensive and that offers a realistic plan for what happens in @entity43 and @entity9 the day after @entity5 is eradicated			1
this would bolster the @entity0 's international standing , better secure coalition countries , as well as prevent the coalition from repeating the mistakes of the past .			2

@entity0 @entity7 has voted in favor of @entity0 joining airstrikes in @entity9
the @entity0 wants to redeem itself after the @entity9 invasion in 2003 , writes @entity185
as it currently stands , the coalition 's plan carries a high risk of backfiring , she says
@entity185 argues that airstrikes will not sever people 's ties with @entity5
