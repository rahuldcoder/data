-- the jubilation over the freeing of three women and a girl from their alleged captivity in @entity6 is quickly giving way to a serious question : did @entity6 police miss clues ? how could @entity11 , @entity11 and @entity11 remain captive for about decade in a densely populated area within a few miles of where each of them disappeared ? the women were freed this week with the help of neighbors			1
the man who lived in the home where the alleged captives were found , @entity11 , was charged wednesday with four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape , @entity6 chief assistant prosecutor @entity18 said			1
prosecutors are not pressing charges against @entity28 and @entity29 , who were also arrested along with their brother @entity30 , with @entity18 saying there 's " no evidence " that they were complicit in the case			0
neighbors say they had called police about suspicious activity at the home in the past			1
@entity6 police deny that , issuing a statement wednesday saying that a " thorough review of police communications records " show no such calls ever took place			1
police say they went to the address once in 2000 , before the alleged kidnappings , when @entity11 reported a fight outside his home , and in 2004 , after two of the three women had disappeared			1
the latter visit was unrelated to the kidnappings , police said			2
child services requested that visit to investigate a complaint that @entity11 had left a child alone on a bus during the time he worked as a bus driver			1
no one answered the door at the home , and investigators later interviewed him elsewhere , police say			2
@entity61 , director of public safety for the city , later told reporters that " there is no evidence to indicate that any of them ( the women ) were ever outside in the yard in chains , without clothing or any other manner			2
" timeline : from missing to liberated neighbors say they reported suspicious activity neighbor @entity76 says that in july 2010 , she and her friends saw a naked woman in the backyard of @entity11 's home			1
they said something to her , and @entity11 " told her to get down			2
so we said something to him			0
he told her to get in the house , " and then he went inside as well , @entity76 said			2
" we called the cops , " she says			2
" they thought we were playing and joking ; they did n't believe us			0
" but @entity93 , @entity76 's sister , told @entity0 's " @entity97 " tuesday night that they called their mother , not the police			1
their mother , @entity98 , did not contact authorities because , she said , she did n't know what to do			0
within a week or two after they saw the naked woman , tarps went up , shielding the backyard from onlookers , @entity76 said			1
@entity76 also said she saw a girl who would sit looking out an open window until @entity11 would come along and board it back up			1
sometimes the girl played at a nearby park by herself			0
" my cousin one day said something to her			0
she said she 's waiting for her dad and then she pointed to ( @entity11 )			2
and she ran up to him , and gave him a hug , and they left			0
" @entity76 feels ' fooled ' by abduction suspect police say the girl is @entity118 's daughter			1
news reports say another neighbor called police after seeing a woman through an attic window of the home , which @entity11 never allowed neighbors to enter			1
and another neighbor , @entity125 -- @entity98 's brother -- says he called police in 2011 when he heard yelling in the @entity11 home			1
officers came a half - hour later , knocked on the door about 20 times over a 10 - minute span , then left after no one answered the door , @entity125 says			0
yet @entity6 police took to @entity135 on wednesday afternoon to dispute such claims			0
after an " extensive " look at its records , @entity6 police said there were no calls to the @entity11 house " for women held or women banging on windows			1
" while denying any tips in the past , authorities are reaching out now to try to get more information about @entity11 and his home , in the hopes it can help their investigation			1
" we continue to ask the community to send tips and information -- to say something if you see something			0
we can not do this alone , " police said in a statement after the women were freed			2
some people in the neighborhood , including @entity11 , the man who helped free the alleged captives , say they do n't recall seeing anything suspicious at @entity11 's home			1
but legal analysts are taking the police to task			0
if someone really heard screaming and police simply knocked on the door and left without further investigation , then " law enforcement clearly dropped the ball , " attorney @entity169 said on @entity0 's " @entity97			2
" " it was almost like a @entity179 situation , " prominent attorney @entity176 added			0
" there 's got to be much more to this story			0
given my experience in handling criminal cases , i ca n't believe that we 're not going to find in the days ahead or the weeks ahead much more that unravels about this that blows your mind			0
" deputy police chief @entity191 , at a press conference wednesday , said investigators over the past 10 years have often asked themselves whether they missed a significant angle			0
the answer , he said , is no. " i 'm just very confident in the ability of those investigators and those law enforcement officers that they checked every single lead and if there was one bit of evidence , one shred of a tip , no matter how minute it was , they followed it up very , very aggressively			0
" @entity0 's @entity206 contributed to this report .			0
