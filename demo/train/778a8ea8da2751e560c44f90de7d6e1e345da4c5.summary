-- last winter , inventor @entity1 was already attempting one seemingly impossible feat -- building a machine to cure cancer with radio waves -- when his device inadvertently succeeded in another : he made saltwater catch fire			1
a test tube full of saltwater fuels a flame			2
tv footage of his bizarre discovery has been burning up the blogosphere ever since , drawing crackpots and @entity17 alike into a raging debate			0
can water burn ? and if so , what good can come of it ? some people gush over the invention 's potential for desalinization or cheap energy			1
@entity27 seawater , after all , sloshes over most of the planet 's surface , and harnessing its heat energy could power all sorts of things			2
skeptics say @entity1 's radio generator is sucking up far more energy than it 's creating , making it a carnival trick at best			1
for now , @entity1 is tuning out the hubbub			1
the retired radio - and television - station owner says the saltwater stuff is interesting , but a cancer breakthrough is what he 's really after			1
diagnosed with leukemia in 2002 , he began building his radio - wave blaster the next year , soon after a relapse			1
his lifelong fascination with radio provided further inspiration			2
radio station antennas , he knew , can turn a bystander 's metal eyeglasses toasty warm			2
if he could seed a person 's cancerous cells with nanoscopic metal particles and blast them with radio waves , perhaps he could kill off the cancer while sparing healthy tissue			1
the saltwater phenomenon happened by accident when an assistant was bombarding a saline - filled test tube with radio waves and bumped the tube , causing a small flash			1
@entity65 , @entity1 struck a match			1
" the water lit like a propane flame , " he recalls			0
" people said , ' it 's a crock			0
look for hidden electrodes in the water , ' " says @entity72 materials scientist @entity71 , who visited the @entity74 , @entity75 , inventor in his lab in august after seeing the feat on @entity78			2
a demo made @entity71 a believer			0
" this is discovery science in the best tradition , " he says			0
@entity71 thinks the sodium chloride in the water may weaken the bonds between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms , which are broken free by radio waves			0
it 's these gas molecules that are igniting , he explains , not the liquid itself			0
tests show that the reaction disappears once the radio waves stop			0
@entity71 plans to conduct more tests to get to the bottom of the mystery			0
meanwhile , researchers at @entity102 in @entity103 and the @entity104 have made progress using @entity107 's technology to fight cancer in animals			1
they published their findings last month in the journal @entity112			0

inventor @entity1 uses a radio - wave blaster to make saltwater catch fire
device could be used to generate cheap energy
@entity1 hopes his device can be used in the fight against cancer
