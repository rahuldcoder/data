an unlikely ally is offering a glimmer of hope that president @entity3 can make good on his vow to close @entity5 before leaving office			1
@entity8 sen. @entity7 , a fierce critic of @entity3 's foreign policy , is about to take the chairmanship of the powerful @entity11			1
he says it 's still possible the war on terror camp in @entity15 could be shut down -- but warns that the administration will have to come up with a clear plan to overcome @entity8 opposition			1
asked in a @entity20 interview whether he was prepared to help his old political foe , despite a congressional ban on sending detainees to the @entity25 mainland , @entity7 said , " i am prepared to and i think it can be done			1
" but he warned that ever since he started talking to the administration about @entity5 in 2009 , it had " never come forward with a plan as to how we treat those individuals that have been judged as too dangerous to ever be released , and that is the hangup			2
" @entity7 , himself a former prisoner of war , has long favored closing @entity5 , which critics say stains the reputation of the @entity25 and is a recruiting tool for terrorists			1
but key players in @entity42 , including many senior republicans , have barred funding for the administration to send remaining inmates elsewhere or to build facilities on the @entity25 mainland			1
speculation about the camp 's future is being stoked by the recent transfers of a group of prisoners to @entity53 last week			0
the @entity25 response to the 9/11 attacks in 2001 is also back in the spotlight because of the recent release of a @entity11 report on enhanced interrogation tactics critics say equate to torture			0
@entity7 said he thought that @entity8 opposition could be overcome , if the administration laid out exactly how it believed it could close @entity5			2
" if i went to the members of the committee today and said , ' look they are going to be moved to a maximum security prison in some location in the @entity25 and we have a plan for that transfer , i think most of them would be perfectly happy about that , " @entity7 said			2
last weekend , the @entity3 administration sent six @entity5 detainees to @entity53 for resettlement as refugees as part of its plan to depopulate the camp prior to its closure			1
four of the former detainees -- @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , and @entity85 -- are @entity87 nationals , while @entity88 is @entity89 , and @entity90 is @entity91 , according to @entity93 press secretary rear adm. @entity94			0
related : @entity8 congressman : we ' ought to rethink ' @entity5 transfer policy i just do n't think that is trustworthy , " @entity7 said , adding that former inmates needed re-education to ensure they did not return to extremism			2
" i am very concerned , " he said			0
@entity8 complain that released detainees are not sufficiently monitored when they leave @entity5 , and cite figures saying that nearly 30 percent of those released are back in the fight against @entity25 forces			2
the transfers leave only 136 detainees at @entity5 , out of an peak population of more than 750			0
that 's the lowest number of inmates at the base in @entity15 since detainees started arriving in 2002			0
@entity5 inmate : my treatment shames @entity25 flag but that leaves the most problematic prisoners , including those who the administration says are too dangerous to be released , and can not be tried in civilian courts as they are considered enemy combatants or the evidence against them is seen as tainted because it was obtained under duress			2
the @entity128 reported in october that @entity3 remained determined to close @entity5 , and was prepared to use executive power to do so if @entity42 would not go along			1
since he won re-election in 2012 , @entity3 has appointed special envoys at the @entity133 departments to try to get foreign countries to accept more foreign detainees			0
he has also lifted the moratorium on lifting sending @entity138 prisoners back home			0
nearly all @entity5 prisoners are being held without charges , and while about half of those are considered high - level threat detainees , the remainder were determined to be low - level threats by a task force of top @entity25 intelligence and law enforcement agencies			0
those in the latter group could gain their freedom , provided security conditions could first be met in their host countries			0
in december 2010 , @entity42 amended the annual defense budget bill to prevent the transfer of any @entity5 detainees to the @entity25			1
that defeated the @entity3 administration 's plans announced a year earlier to try several @entity5 detainees involved in the 9/11 terrorist attacks in @entity25 federal court			1
shutting down @entity5 : who 's left and what 's in the way			0

sen. @entity7 says @entity5 could still be closed
but demands @entity3 administration offer clear plan
@entity42 banned detainee transfers to @entity25 mainland in 2010
