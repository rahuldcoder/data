-- jurors in @entity2 , @entity3 , awarded a former boy scout $ 1.4 million after finding tuesday that the organization was negligent in allowing a @entity7 leader who was a sex offender to have contact with him			1
the three - week trial ended with @entity11 circuit court judge @entity10 polling the jurors , who confirmed they had found the negligence contributed to damage to the plaintiff as claimed			2
the jury ruled that the plaintiff is also entitled to punitive damages			1
that 's to be determined beginning tuesday in the trial 's second phase			1
how the @entity21 handled the case of the former @entity7 leader , @entity23 , was at the center of the explosive lawsuit			1
attorney @entity26 , who has been representing six men suing the @entity21 , would not discuss the case until after the punitive phase			1
before the trial , he alleged that when his clients were boys during the 1980s , the organization knew that at least one of them had been abused by @entity23			1
he also alleged that though @entity23 was removed as a @entity7 leader , he was allowed to stay on as a volunteer and the abuse continued			1
@entity0 was not able to reach @entity23			2
@entity26 produced documents that he said were part of an archive of previously secret @entity7 files that chronicled decades of abuse of boys			0
the @entity21 ' lawyers said the organization had not known about @entity23 ' record nor had it known about an outstanding warrant at the time			1
once the @entity21 did learn about it , the organization acted immediately and cooperated with police , the @entity21 ' lawyers said			2
a @entity21 spokesman has acknowledged the organization does have confidential files , but said they are made confidential in order to protect people who are ineligible to be @entity7 leaders but who may not have done anything illegal			1
a @entity21 spokesman said that , in recent years , the organization has taken extensive measures to keep abusers out			1
in a written statement , the @entity21 said the organization intends to appeal			2
" we are gravely disappointed with the verdict , " it said			0
" we believe that the allegations made against our youth protection efforts are not valid			0
" it added , " we are saddened by what happened to the plaintiff			0
the actions of the man who committed these crimes do not represent the values and ideals of the @entity76			0
" the safety of the young people currently in the @entity79 has never been in question during these legal proceedings			0
the case focused on a discussion about what society and the @entity76 knew about child abuse approximately three decades ago			2
" this is a long - standing societal issue that every youth - serving organization must address			0
based on the standard of care of that time , the @entity76 believes it acted responsibly and that the evidence presented during the trial does not justify the verdict			2
" while holding the @entity76 60 percent negligent , the jury said the @entity94 -- which oversees scouting activities in the region -- was 15 percent negligent and the @entity97 25 percent negligent			0
the church has sponsored a number of @entity7 troops , including the one to which the plaintiff belonged			0
@entity103 , a lawyer representing the church , said tuesday 's verdict has no impact on the church , since it settled the case out of court more than a year ago			1
" the church absolutely condemns any kind of child abuse , " he said			0
" because of the way the law is set up in @entity3 , we thought it made sense both to help the victim and also to get this behind the victim and us to settle this case			0
" @entity0 's @entity122 contributed to this story .			0
