-- the @entity1 issued a report friday detailing human rights violations such as killings and rapes over a 10 - year period in the @entity7 -- a massive document that a @entity7 diplomat calls " detailed , " " credible " and " heartbreaking			2
" the draft report , titled " @entity11 , " documents crimes against humanity throughout the @entity7 between 1993 and 2003			1
" tens of thousands of people were killed , and numerous others were raped , mutilated or otherwise victimized during the decade , " the @entity14 said			0
the report , which had been previously leaked , accuses @entity21 forces of committing atrocities			1
it notes the involvement of at least 21 armed @entity7 groups in serious human rights violations and the military operations of eight other states inside @entity7			0
along with detailing the atrocities , the report is designed to find ways " to deal with the legacy of these violations , including truth , justice , reparation and reform			2
" the period covered by this report is probably one of the most tragic chapters in the recent history of the @entity7 , " the report says			2
" indeed , this decade was marked by a string of major political crises , wars and multiple ethnic and regional conflicts that brought about the deaths of hundreds of thousands , if not millions , of people			0
" the report devotes attention to violence against women and children			1
" violence in the @entity7 was , in fact , accompanied by the apparent systematic use of rape and sexual assault allegedly by all combatant forces , " it says			2
" this report highlights the apparently recurrent , widespread and systematic nature of these phenomena and concludes that the majority of the incidents of sexual violence reported , could if judicially proven , constitute offences and violations under domestic law , international human rights law , and international humanitarian law			1
" the report says at least 30,000 children were recruited by armed forces or groups and that " children have been subjected to indescribable violence			1
" " if this situation is allowed to continue , there is a risk that a new generation will be created that has known nothing but violence , and violence as a means of conflict resolution , thus compromising the country 's chances of achieving lasting peace , " the report says			1
@entity21 forces and an allied rebel group massacred ethnic @entity98 in the country , the report says			1
" tens of thousands " of @entity98 civilians were slaughtered with knives , bludgeoned with hammers and burned alive as the @entity21 army and the @entity103 swept across @entity7 -- then called @entity7 -- leading to the toppling of dictator @entity105			1
more than 1 million @entity21 fled to neighboring @entity7 when the @entity21 genocide ended in 1994 -- most of them @entity98			1
in 1996 , @entity21 invaded @entity7 in pursuit of the genocide orchestrators , who were living amid hundreds of thousands of other refugees			1
saying the report is flawed , @entity21 said it " reserves the right to review " its " various engagements " with the @entity1			1
the country has participated in @entity1 peacekeeping missions , such as @entity121 's @entity120 region			0
" we note that the @entity1 also recognizes that the report omits crucial historical context , uses problematic methodology and sourcing , and the standard of proof used to justify the allegations in it is woefully inadequate , " said @entity122 , foreign minister and government spokeswoman			2
" it seems clear that no amount of tinkering can resuscitate the credibility of this fundamentally misguided process			0
this report is yet another attempt to distort @entity21 's history and prolong instability in the @entity141			1
" @entity142 , @entity7 's ambassador to the @entity1 , welcomed the publication of the report and called it " detailed , " " credible , " and " heartbreaking			2
" " the @entity7 government , and i personally , are appalled at the horrific nature and scope of crimes documented in this report that the people of the @entity7 have suffered , " @entity142 said			0
" sadly , this information is not new to us			0
millions of @entity7 men , women and children have borne the brunt of the @entity7 's conflicts over the past 15 years			0
far too many have died			0
like nearly all @entity7 , i too lost loved ones in the war			0
@entity142 said justice must be meted out for the crimes			0
" far too often , @entity7 voices go unheeded			0
i truly hope that this time it is going to be different			0
