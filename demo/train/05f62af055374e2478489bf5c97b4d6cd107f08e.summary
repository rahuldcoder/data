@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the days after sgt. @entity5 was released from nearly five years in captivity , yellow ribbons and banners celebrating his release decorated the main street , red - bricked storefronts of his hometown			1
a sense of relief and excitement filled the air : @entity5 would soon be home			1
but more than four months after @entity5 returned to the @entity19 , the ribbons and banners are gone			1
this town 's relationship with the saga of their homegrown prisoner of war is complicated			1
we 're over it , " @entity0 mayor @entity26 said as he denied @entity2 's request for an on - camera interview			1
" we stood by the @entity5 family to get @entity5 home but we need to move on			1
" inside a secure locker of the @entity34 , there are boxes filled with thousands of letters for @entity5			1
the letters were sent to the @entity38 as part of a " @entity42 " campaign started through social media last november , just months before @entity5 would be released			2
@entity43 , a @entity5 family friend , spearheaded the letter campaign			2
in three months , @entity43 said , several hundred thousand letters poured into the @entity38			0
a few of those boxes were eventually shipped to @entity1			2
@entity43 ca n't bring herself to throw the letters away			0
" it means that people all over the world cared about @entity5 , " @entity43 said			1
" we would hope that he would like to read through them one day to see just how much he meant to so many people			0
" the boxes are a symbol of how the story of @entity5 's rescue did n't come with a triumphant homecoming			1
@entity5 's release on may 30 was instantly doused in controversy			1
many of the soldiers who served with him accused the 28 - year - old soldier of deserting his unit by walking off the @entity67 base before he was captured			2
there was also intense criticism of the @entity71 administration for trading @entity5 for five @entity73 prisoners held in @entity74 , @entity75			1
@entity5 now sits in a sort of limbo			2
he has completed the @entity79 's formal reintegration program and continues psychological treatment			0
he is still assigned to a unit with @entity82 in @entity83 , performing " administrative duties			0
" but @entity5 is also waiting to hear if he 'll face any criminal charges in the military justice system			2
in august , he was questioned by gen. @entity87 for two days			0
the @entity79 announced on friday that @entity87 completed the initial report on his findings in the @entity5 case			2
the report will now be reviewed by the director of the @entity79 staff and senior @entity79 leaders			0
" this will be a lengthy process , " an @entity79 spokesman wrote			0
" it would be inappropriate to speculate on the potential results or the amount of time the review process will take to complete			0
" when news of @entity5 's release broke , his family and friends had hoped for a quick reunion			1
for nearly five years , the lives of @entity5 's parents had been consumed by the plight of their son			1
his father , @entity112 , has said he kept his clocks set to the time in @entity67			1
he grew a beard , to the dismay of many critics , to show solidarity with his son			0
@entity112 also taught himself @entity119 , the language of his son 's captors , to communicate directly with the @entity73			0
in the days after his son 's release , critics used those details to accuse @entity112 of sympathizing with the @entity73			0
@entity5 's parents have declined all requests for interviews			1
family friends say @entity112 has shaved his beard			0
but the expected family reunion never materialized and the @entity5 family soon stopped answering questions about why @entity5 was refusing to see his parents			1
sources tell @entity2 that @entity5 is now " communicating " with his parents , but a face - to - face reunion still has not occurred			2
the sources would not elaborate on how @entity5 is communicating with his family			2
military officials have said @entity5 has been given every opportunity to reunite with his family			2
@entity5 's attorney , @entity141 , declined to talk about @entity5 's communication with his family			1
@entity5 grew up among a tight - knit community of families in @entity0 that home - schooled their children			2
@entity148 's son was one of @entity5 's best friends			1
@entity148 said @entity5 was raised in an intensely religious atmosphere with a strict code of conduct			0
around age 16 , @entity148 said , @entity5 left home and embarked on a series of adventures			0
" no doubt it was some kind of rebellion , " @entity148 said			0
but @entity148 could n't say if that childhood rebellion was still a source of tension between @entity5 and his family			0
he said he also wonders why the soldier has n't reunited with his parents			0
" there may have been something there that was a bone of contention , " said @entity148			0
" maybe it 's the debriefing ( reintegration process ) or because he feels like he has let them down or for some other unknown reason he just does n't want to have that emotional recognition again of his parents			0
" @entity148 said that as a child @entity5 struggled to control his frustration and would often disappear for days at a time , building forts and hiking for miles into the @entity1 wilderness			1
@entity148 said he sees a parallel between the young @entity5 he knew and the soldier accused by fellow soldiers of walking off his military base in @entity67 in 2009			1
" @entity5 did have a tendency to get really frustrated and just to walk off and throw up his hands , " said @entity148			0
around @entity0 , one often hears people asking the same question , will @entity5 ever come back home ? @entity5 must wait to hear what military commanders will determine about his fate			1
will he be charged with a crime ? will he be discharged ? @entity5 's lawyer has said the soldier would like to continue his education			1
@entity148 hopes he makes time to visit @entity1			1
" we have a hunting trip waiting for him			0
we are going to talk about things around the fire , " said @entity148			0
@entity2 's @entity197 contributed to this report .			0

@entity5 , held captive in @entity67 , has been free since may
people in his @entity1 hometown worked to publicize him while he was *hostage*
but his *freedom* came with questions and town mayor says it 's time to move on
