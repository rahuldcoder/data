the on - pitch collapse of an @entity2 soccer player at the weekend raises questions about how such highly - trained athletes can be struck down in such a manner			1
professional sports players are generally in prime physical condition , especially with today 's advanced physiological , nutritional and medical knowledge			1
however , @entity9 is the latest in a growing list of athletes around the world who have suffered heart problems -- seemingly out of nowhere			1
so why does it happen , and can it be prevented ? " what is important to realize is that playing sport vigorously can unmask an undiagnosed , underlying condition , " says dr. @entity15 , a medical expert from @entity16			1
" so when we see someone have a subarachnoid haemorrhage , a sudden stroke on the field of play , we 're shocked by it			0
if someone has a cardiac arrest , we 're very shocked by it			0
these events are n't common , especially amongst athletes , but they are n't rare either			0
" @entity32 says , in the @entity35 , 12 young people under the age of 35 die each week from undiagnosed cardiac conditions -- but only one in 45,000 sportsmen will suffer such a death			1
but are n't there tests that can stop this happening ? yes , but they differ from country to country , says @entity46 - based cardiologist dr. @entity45			1
" testing is very controversial in the medical community as far as what type of testing , when to screen , how to screen , " says @entity45 , who works at @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity49			1
the @entity2 , for example , says all players aged 16 - 18 at its member clubs " must go through a cardiological examination / screening " and then have follow - ups " as early in their careers as possible and again if the annual medical screen shows any results that warrant a further examination			1
" that should have covered the 23 - year - old @entity9 , who came to @entity16 from the @entity67 in 1999 at the age of 11 and began his career at top - flight club @entity70 before joining @entity71 in 2008 from @entity72			1
" they have described a cardiovascular exam , but that 's not really described in detail -- does that mean physical exam plus an @entity78 ( electrocardiogram ) ? " asks @entity45			1
" this varies from country to country depending on what the recommendations are			0
the @entity46 is not actually advocating @entity84 , but that 's very controversial internationally			1
there are some bodies that have had very close monitoring of this on a population basis , such as @entity91 where they said ekgs make a huge difference in detecting this in a population			0
" so what is wrong with @entity9 ? the exact diagnosis has yet to be released , but experts seem to agree it is most likely hypertrophic cardiomyopathy -- a condition where the heart muscle thickens , causing a stoppage of blood flow			2
" it is one of the most common genetic cardiac conditions in the human population , " says @entity45			2
" a lot of times these types of conditions can be passed on from generation to generation			2
whether mr. @entity9 knew his family history from this standpoint , we do n't know			0
" @entity32 says this condition is slightly more common in black athletes than white ones			0
" there is also the possibility of a cardiac arrhythmia , where the rhythm of the heart is broken and a cardiac arrest occurs , " he says			2
" a third reason could be the congenital abnormality of the structure of the coronary arteries , again , which he would be born with -- and which might not have been diagnosed			0
" does heart testing guarantee that these conditions will be discovered ? " with @entity78 screening , sometimes this is n't caught , " @entity45 says			1
" with the hypertrophic cardio myopathy we 're discussing , about 70 % of the time the first incidence of that being diagnosed is with a sudden cardiac death episode			0
" @entity32 says that sports players should have both @entity84 ( which interpret electrical activity ) and echo cardiagrams -- which use ultrasound techniques to create images of the heart			1
" there was a screening program that was very effective in @entity91 , for example , where all their young professional sports people were being screened , " he says			1
" they were detecting quite large numbers of abnormality and indeed they were able to reduce their mortality rate by 90 %			0
" there are people here in this country and elsewhere in @entity160 and the rest of the world looking at more effective screening procedures to try to diagnose those conditions which are previously undiagnosed			1
" will @entity9 , who is in critical condition in intensive care , be able to survive ? " the fact that care providers were there and got to him immediately -- the word was that defibrillators were available , which is crucial at sporting events and arenas -- i think that if he makes it that will be a crucial aspect in his recovery , " says @entity45			2
@entity9 collapsed just before halftime in a match at @entity181 , and medics rushed onto the pitch to try to revive him			0
his heart did not start working again until he reached the hospital			2
" the critical thing with someone who has had a cardiac arrest is to try to establish circulation as soon as possible , so the quicker that happens , the better , " @entity32 says			0
" and clearly , in the case where there is no heartbeat re-established , normally , for two hours , the outlook is not good			0
it 's all about getting enough oxygen to the brain , getting oxygen to the kidneys			2
and the longer that break in circulation happens , the worse the outlook			0
" but he 's in hospital , he 's in intensive care , he 's been there for two days and there have been no further reports			2
so whilst he has been given every chance of life , i 'm afraid the outlook is not good			0
" could the same thing happen to me ? " it 's completely counter-intuitive to look at a 23 - year - old , very fit , highly talented sportsman like @entity9 having a cardiac arrest on the pitch with no prior warning , and it makes everyone think , ' could this happen to me ? ' " explains @entity32			1
" he would have had some underlying condition			2
he was fit in every other respect , and sport does make us fit , but it does n't rule out any underlying subtle conditions which are difficult to diagnose without screening tests			1
anybody playing a sport at a high level should be screened			0
" @entity45 agrees that sports stars should be able to cope with the physical rigors of their profession			0
" for athletes at this level , these gentlemen train to compete day in , day out , " he says			0
" of course , if they 're pushing themselves beyond the human limits in terms of how well hydrated they are and how their electrolyte balances are , you can predispose even the most competitive athlete to abnormal heart rhythms and straining the heart muscle , but from experience in previous history and previous cases , this likely has some underlying cause to it			1

soccer player 's tragic collapse sparks *debate* about heart problems in sporting arena
@entity16 doctor says that top - level competition can unmask underlying health conditions
cardiologist in @entity46 says that screening can not always discover these problems
they both call for more heart testing for top sports players
