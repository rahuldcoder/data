-- in early september my @entity1 fell off the roof of my @entity5 wagon			1
the @entity5 was traveling at highway speeds when it happened			0
i 'd placed and forgotten the @entity1 on the roof of the @entity5 before driving off — something i 'd done repeatedly with inexplicable witlessness in the past , though i somehow managed not to lose the phone on those earlier jaunts			1
i imagine the phone hurtling off the top as i rounded the bend ( that i eventually found it lying beside ) like a @entity16 special deploying chaff ( thankfully no one was behind me , and the phone wound up on the shoulder , though it may have been run over first )			0
i was able to track it down a few hours later after i realized it was missing by using my wife 's @entity1 and the freebie @entity23 app @entity25			1
when i went to the local @entity26 to see what my options were , @entity23 offered me a choice : repair the screen right then and there in under an hour , or swap it for a brand new phone			1
the cost to swap for a new phone was $ 229 , or just a little more than i paid for the phone outright on contract			0
the cost to repair the screen was $ 149 : $ 99 for @entity37 plus $ 49 for the screen replacement			0
i chose to replace the phone outright , because it nearly a year old , i 'm on contract and so would n't have been eligible to upgrade to the @entity41 ( then unannounced , but presumptive ) , i did n't have @entity37 and i figured the fresh battery i 'd get with a new @entity1 was worth the bargain			2
which is all a longish way of saying that @entity23 's been offering @entity1 repairs in - store for some time — and it looks like that repair program 's about to expand significantly			1
@entity49 reports that @entity23 may be planning to offer additional in - store repairs that go well beyond the @entity52 s screen			1
note that my phone 's glass was cracked , but the underlying area and componentry was unfazed			0
had those parts been distressed , i assume my only option would have been full phone replacement			0
@entity49 's sources say @entity23 is rolling out " special machinery " to allow the stores to replace and calibrate the touchscreens on the @entity41 and 5c , and that the cost for such replacement would be $ 149			2
the other items on the list of in - store replaceable parts are said to include volume buttons , the vibration engine , the rear - camera , the speaker system and the home buttons — though in the latter case , it sounds like not on the @entity41 , which employs a more sophisticated @entity77 fingerprint button			1
the repairs should be free if you 're covered under @entity37 , but you 'll have to pony up if not — $ 79 for a new battery and $ 29 for home button replacement , according to @entity49 's sources			2
when ? @entity49 's sources say the machines are arriving in stores now , suggesting the program could launch soon			0
