@entity0 -- president @entity3 's angry response to a reporter who interrupted his @entity6 remarks friday was the latest salvo in what some political experts see as an era of incivility			1
@entity12 , a @entity13 correspondent for the @entity0 - based website @entity15 , asked the president about his administration 's dramatic policy shift on immigration while the president was in the middle of delivering prepared remarks			1
" excuse me , sir			2
it 's not time for questions , sir , " @entity3 fired back			1
" not while i 'm speaking			1
" @entity12 later told @entity1 's @entity25 , " i have to ask the questions you all wo n't ask , " referring to the reporters gathered who regularly cover the @entity13			2
@entity3 calls policy ' the right thing to do ' " i always go to the @entity13 prepared with questions for our president			1
i timed the question believing the president was closing his remarks , because naturally i have no intention of interrupting the president of the @entity42 , " @entity12 said in a statement on the @entity15 's website			1
" i know he rarely takes questions before walking away from the podium			2
when i asked the question as he finished his speech , he turned his back on the many reporters and walked away while i and at least one other reporter asked questions			2
" the president and journalist 's terse exchange reflects the heightened polarized climate , political experts say			2
" we are in an era of incivility , " said @entity57 , an associate professor of political science at @entity59 in @entity60			0
" there 's been an erosion of respect for government officials post @entity67			0
" that erosion of respect also extends to the media			0
" part of the reason journalists have a bad reputation is that we 're seen as rude and pushy , but in general you probably do n't interrupt your mom if she 's talking and you probably do n't interrupt the president , " said @entity69 , dean of the @entity70 of @entity71 at @entity72			1
@entity81 : immigration change makes long - term fix harder @entity3 has faced his fair share of heckling			1
in 2009 , @entity87 @entity86 rep. @entity86 yelled " you lie " during the @entity89 address			0
the resulting controversy resulted in @entity86 being formally taken to task by the @entity93			0
the lawmaker later offered the president an apology			2
earlier this year , @entity98 gov. @entity97 was seen wagging her finger at @entity3 while on a @entity101 airport tarmac during his visit there			1
last year , @entity105 rep. @entity104 said first lady @entity107 " has a large posterior , " a comment critics called racist and sexist			0
he , too , offered an apology			0
also in 2011 , @entity111 rep. @entity110 apologized for comments he made on a radio program ; he used the word " tar baby " to refer to the administration 's policies			0
then there were all those derogatory and racially tinged signs at tea party rallies during summer 2010			0
@entity121 : @entity3 's immigration move good policy , good politics previous presidents have also faced heckling and rude comments			1
a gathering of those attending @entity3 's inauguration booed former president @entity131 as he and his wife departed the @entity13 by helicopter			1
in 2008 , an @entity135 journalist threw a shoe at @entity131 during a press conference in @entity138 and yelled , " this is a farewell kiss from the @entity135 people , you dog			0
" but as the nation 's first black president , the nature of @entity3 's heckling often feels as if there is something else lurking beneath the surface , @entity57 said			1
" this is the dark undercurrent to the increased diversity of @entity42 culture , " @entity57 said			0
" usually when you have periods of progress there 's some sort of backlash			0
" it 's very difficult to parse out what is an undertone of disrespect from actions that have tinges of racism , said @entity166 , an african - american studies professor at @entity167 and the author of several books , including " new black man : rethinking @entity171			2
" " i do n't think you can separate the two , " @entity166 said			0
" even if it were a more civil moment @entity3 would be dealing with race in his presidency			1
the incivility piece is incredibly important here because i think that 's largely been lost			0
