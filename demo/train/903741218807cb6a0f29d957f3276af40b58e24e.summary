-- sporadic and intermittent gunfire rang out in @entity2 for a fourth day on thursday as armed forces continued to clash with @entity5 rebels holding as many as 180 hostages on the @entity8 island of @entity9			1
lt. colonel @entity10 , spokesman for the @entity8 armed forces ( @entity12 ) , told @entity0 that government troops currently had " contained " an estimated 180 @entity15 rebels in five districts of the mainly @entity18 city			1
" right now we went to ensure that we keep them in those locations so they ca n't get in and they ca n't get out , " he said			2
" but unfortunately they are holding between 160 and 180 hostages			2
" he said their original plan had been to land by sea and march on @entity2 's city hall and raise the @entity15 flag			1
" we stopped that but now our immediate concern is the safety and the security of the hostages , " @entity10 said , adding that @entity8 troops were under orders to contain the rebels and were not engaged in what he called " offensive operations			1
" he said the intermittent gunfire that could be heard across the city was a part of the containment operation			1
" sometimes these elements ( rebels ) are trying to punch out and they fire at us so we also fire at them , " @entity10 said			2
he said the condition of the hostages was not known , but crisis managers were concerned about a lack of food and water			2
@entity10 said rebels had killed two government troops -- one during the first encounter at sea and the second was killed by sniper fire on tuesday -- and wounded 17 more			1
@entity12 forces had recovered one rebel body			0
" we ca n't verify the rebel body count because we do n't have the bodies but the best figure that we have is that @entity12 has killed 14 @entity15 , " he said			2
almost 13,000 people have been evacuated from the districts of @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 in @entity2 , government sources said			1
@entity2 's mayor , @entity75 , told a press briefing that she had been in direct contact with the head of the @entity15 rebels , @entity80 , and the leader of the hostage takers , @entity83			1
" last night i was able to talk to chairman @entity80 hoping that it would pave the way for the peaceful end of this crisis , " @entity84 said			0
" what is of interest is that @entity80 disowned the actions of @entity83 , the leader of the hostage - takers with whom i communicated separately			0
" @entity10 said that while @entity80 had disavowed the actions of @entity83 , saying that the commanders in the @entity15 were free to carry out actions as they wished , he said it was the government 's belief that @entity80 was behind the current rebel action			0
the @entity15 , a separatist movement founded in 1971 by @entity80 with the aim of establishing an autonomous region for @entity103 in this mainly @entity105 country , signed a peace deal with the central government in @entity108 in 1996 , though some of its members have broken away to continue a violent campaign			0
last month , @entity80 issued a " declaration of independence " for the @entity120 nation -- referring to @entity9 's indigenous @entity5 population -- after complaining that the @entity15 had been left out of a recent wealth - sharing agreement with another insurgent group , the @entity113 , or @entity113 , which has fought for decades to set up an independent @entity115 state on the resource - rich island of @entity9			1
under the agreement signed this year , @entity103 will get a 75 % share of income derived from the exploitation of metallic minerals in the area -- reported to include gold and copper			0
the current stand - off is believed to be linked to the terms of the agreement			0
@entity8 president @entity134 's plan is to achieve lasting peace in the region by 2016 when his term ends			0
agreements have yet to be reached on power - sharing and normalization , which means giving up arms			0
a report published last year by the @entity143 warned that the peace process needed to find ways to support insurgents as they build normal , civilian lives .			0
