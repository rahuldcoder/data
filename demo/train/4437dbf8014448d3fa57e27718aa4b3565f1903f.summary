-- the @entity1 has announced that on wednesday , at the invitation of @entity5 chancellor @entity4 , president @entity2 will speak in @entity6 at the city 's landmark @entity7			1
the president 's subject will be the transatlantic alliance and the enduring bonds between the @entity14 and @entity15			1
@entity6 comes as a welcome relief for @entity2			1
it gives him a chance to put aside for the moment the difficulties he is having in the @entity23 and with the @entity25 spying scandal			0
the president 's @entity6 appearance also reminds us that he is following in historic footsteps			1
june 26 marks the 50th anniversary of president @entity33 's famous " @entity32 " speech , praising the citizens of @entity6 for their refusal to be intimidated by the massive @entity5 - built wall that since 1961 had divided their city			1
the reaction of the crowd listening to @entity33 address them in front of @entity6 's @entity42 was so overwhelming that , on the plane leaving @entity15 , he remarked to his aide , @entity44 , who had written most of his speech , " we 'll never have another day like this one as long as we live			1
" @entity33 is always given style points for his @entity6 speech because of its easy - to - remember rhetoric			1
but the speech is worth recalling today because it amounted to such a profound pivot away from the prevailing nuclear logic of the @entity53			0
in @entity6 , @entity33 recast how he believed the @entity53 should be waged in the future in a way that made his thinking clear to the @entity58 and @entity59 public			1
for @entity33 , the chance to speak near the @entity61 two years after it was built was a major opportunity to redefine his foreign policy leadership			2
in his 1961 @entity65 summit meeting with @entity67 premier @entity66 , @entity33 had gotten off to a rocky start			2
in 1962 , during the @entity69 , he had regained his footing			0
he had resisted calls by some of the @entity73 for a massive airstrike against @entity75 and made sure he and the @entity67 avoided backing each other into a nuclear exchange			0
in @entity6 , @entity33 showed that he had learned from both confrontations			1
instead of treating the @entity53 as simply a battle over which side had the most military power and the will to use it , he framed it as a battle that also included the fate of captive peoples and their right to self - determination			0
it was an emphasis that would bear fruit in the @entity91 spring of 1968 , in @entity93 's solidarity movement and finally in @entity95 's 1987 @entity7 speech with its memorable line , " mr. @entity88 , tear down this wall ! " @entity33 's rhetoric in @entity6 was equal to his good intentions			1
" two thousand years ago , the proudest boast was ' civis @entity101 sum ' ( " i am a @entity103 citizen " )			0
today , in the world of freedom the proudest boast is ' @entity32 , ' " @entity33 declared			2
his words paid tribute to those @entity15 trapped in a divided @entity6 , but his overriding point was , " freedom is indivisible , and when one man is enslaved , all are not free			1
" @entity33 was doing the opposite of saber - rattling			2
he was updating the ideas behind the @entity115 so they spoke directly to contemporary @entity58			0
when his audience heard @entity33 's words , they were reminded of the @entity119 of 1948 , in which @entity14 responded to the @entity67 ground blockade of @entity6 with an airlift that brought @entity122 the food and supplies they needed without @entity14 troops firing a shot			1
earlier in june 1963 , @entity33 had established the groundwork for his @entity6 speech with an address he gave at @entity131 in @entity132			1
there , he spoke about establishing the conditions for an " attainable peace " that was neither a @entity136 nor a peace of the grave			0
the @entity67 , @entity33 cautioned , needed to abandon its distorted view of an @entity14 ready to unleash a preventative nuclear war , but at the same time @entity14 needed to make sure that it did not fall into the same trap as the @entity67 by seeing @entity142 through a distorted ideological lens			0
ever the practical politician , @entity33 conceded that he had no " magic formula " for bringing about such a change in the world 's two superpowers , but it was possible , he concluded , to debate the @entity53 without each side making new threats			2
" we can seek a relaxation of tensions without relaxing our guard , " he insisted			0
today , the @entity131 speech is widely praised , but at the time , the speech was seen primarily as a policy statement			0
the public reaction to the speech was minimal			0
one day later , the @entity131 proposals were replaced as a front - page story by the highly charged racial confrontation between the @entity33 administration and @entity167 gov. @entity166 over the admission of two @entity59 students to the formerly all - white @entity170			0
@entity6 was a different story in terms of its popular impact and a sign that @entity33 was becoming increasingly sophisticated in using his personal popularity to promote policy change			2
in @entity6 , the still - young president took advantage of being on the global stage to make it easier for friend and foe alike to see him as a leader eager to steer @entity14 and the world away from nuclear confrontation			2
his efforts were not wasted			0
two months after his @entity6 speech , the @entity14 , @entity187 and the @entity67 signed the @entity189 , the first such agreement since atomic bombs were dropped on @entity192			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 .			0

president @entity2 is to give a speech in @entity6 on transatlantic alliance
it comes on the eve of anniversary of @entity33 's famous @entity6 speech
@entity33 used the *occasion* to signal his solidarity with people of @entity6
@entity209 says @entity33 's overriding point was : when one is enslaved , all of us are not free
