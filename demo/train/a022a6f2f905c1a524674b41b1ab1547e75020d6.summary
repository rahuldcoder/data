an accidental dance floor bump and a spilled drink agitated then - @entity4 player @entity3 before he allegedly shot and killed two men in @entity6 , an assistant district attorney said wednesday during @entity3 's arraignment			1
the arraignment , in which @entity3 pleaded not guilty to two counts of first - degree murder and other charges , had prosecutors revealing the most details to date about a possible motive in the july 2012 killings of @entity16 and @entity17			1
@entity3 , 24 , has been jailed since his arrest last year in connection with the june 2013 slaying of @entity21 in southern @entity22			1
authorities began investigating him in the 2012 slayings after his arrest in the @entity21 case			2
he was n't indicted in the double homicide until this month			0
@entity3 attorney @entity28 objected to the court letting @entity31 assistant district attorney @entity30 give " a speech " about the prosecution 's case , arguing that the prosecutor was trying to poison the jury pool			1
authorities say @entity3 and a friend -- driving from @entity39 to @entity6 -- arrived at @entity6 's @entity40 in the early morning of july 16 , 2012			1
@entity3 did n't know the victims before that night , and had no interaction with them until a dancing @entity16 accidentally bumped into @entity3 -- spilling some of @entity3 's drink -- as the @entity4 tight end stood at the edge of a dance floor , said @entity30			1
" ( @entity3 ) became angered and increasingly agitated , particularly after mr. @entity16 smiled and did not apologize , " @entity30 said			2
no argument was seen , and the eventual victims were n't " even aware that the defendant had become angered or agitated , " @entity30 said			0
@entity3 told a friend at the lounge " that mr. @entity16 had deliberately bumped him and was , quote , ' trying him , ' " @entity30 said			1
investigators believe that @entity3 , in prior months , " had become increasingly sensitive and angered by what he believed to be people testing , trying or otherwise disrespecting him when he frequented nightclubs in the area , " according to @entity30			2
the friend , attempting to calm @entity3 , walked him outside , and they eventually entered a club across the street , the prosecutor said			1
at the second club , @entity3 pointed out a small group of men and told his friend he believed that the man who bumped into him at the @entity40 had followed him , @entity30 said			1
" witness testimony and video surveillance reveal , however , that the defendant 's belief was mistaken , as the victims never left @entity40 lounge until after 2 a.m. , " @entity30 said			0
@entity3 and his friend left the second club and returned to the suv in which they 'd arrived , @entity30 said			1
they drove around , and at some point they pulled over on a nearby street , @entity30 said			0
@entity3 retrieved a revolver from the engine block of the suv , where he had hidden the gun shortly before he and his friend left @entity39 , @entity30 said			2
the 2012 shootings authorities previously said that the victims and three of their friends left the @entity40 and drove away , unaware that @entity3 was driving behind them			1
when the victims ' car stopped at a red light , @entity3 's suv pulled up beside it			2
" @entity3 then fired a .38 - caliber revolver multiple times from the driver 's side of his vehicle into the passenger 's side of the victims ' vehicle , " @entity31 district attorney @entity93 said earlier this month			1
@entity103 , the driver , was shot several times and fatally hit in the chest			0
@entity17 , who was in the front passenger seat , was struck multiple times and gravely wounded with a shot to the head , the district attorney said			2
two backseat passengers escaped injury and ran from the car			0
a third man remained in the car and suffered a wound to his arm , @entity93 said			0
defense attorney : prosecution trying to poison jury pool in addition to the two counts of first - degree murder , @entity3 also pleaded not guilty to three counts of armed assault with intent to murder and one count of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon , the district attorney said			1

the @entity4 finished the regular season with 12 wins and four losses and won the @entity139			0
they lost to the @entity140 in the @entity139 championship game			0
authorities say they began investigating @entity3 in the 2012 killings after they found the suv -- at a @entity39 home of @entity3 's relatives -- while investigating him in the 2013 @entity21 case			1
@entity3 , already held without bail in the @entity21 case , also was ordered held without a bail opportunity in the 2012 case			1
@entity28 , the attorney for @entity3 , objected to @entity30 's extended remarks			1
" there is no reason at all to have a speech by the district attorney 's office about what they say the facts are , and the court has just played along with that , " @entity28 said			0
" this is not supposed to be a spectacle			0
this is not supposed to be a sporting contest			0
" " i object to the court giving the district attorney 's office an opportunity to present its one - sided view of the case after a one - sided grand jury proceeding , " @entity28 said			0
the judge noted that @entity28 also had an opportunity to speak , and that to prevent the prosecution to speak about the case would violate " custom and procedure that dates back quite a few years			0
" the next court date was set for june 24			0
the 2013 @entity21 killing law enforcement has focused on @entity3 since he was arrested in june			2
he was charged with first - degree murder and weapons charges in connection with the shooting death of @entity21 , a 27 - year - old semipro football player , in @entity188 , @entity22 , about a mile from @entity3 's home			1
