@entity0 is positioned as the geographic , economic and political bridge straddling both @entity2 and @entity3			1
how prime minister @entity4 performs if he secures a first round victory in sunday 's presidential election will determine if this sizable emerging market can restore its luster as an engine for growth and a regional political force			1
the scrappy former mayor of @entity13 came to power promising a new brand of @entity16 under the party he co-founded , the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) : one that is pro-business and one that in the recent past juggled good relations with both @entity24 and @entity25			0
economically speaking , @entity4 has delivered			2
@entity0 enjoyed growth of 6 - 8 % for the better part of his first decade in power			2
gone are the days of hyper - inflation ( although the latest reading of 9.3 % in july is not low ) -- as well as the multiple zeroes at the end of lira notes -- thanks to the currency stability he introduced the current prime minister became the darling of @entity41 companies , which took advantage of the @entity43 offering lower export tariffs , and turned @entity0 into a manufacturing hub for @entity3			1
foreign direct investment surged ten-fold , from just $ 20 billion in 2001 to over $ 200 billion today			0
3,300 international companies now call @entity0 home according to @entity49			2
but many believe this presidential election will not broaden democracy in @entity0 , but only help @entity4 consolidate his grip on power in an effort to burnish his legacy			1
" @entity4 's 12 month strategy is to engineer , de jure or de facto , as much of a transfer of power from the prime minister 's office to the presidential palace as he can , " wrote professor @entity57 of @entity58 in @entity59			1
this strategy could dilute the role of the @entity0 parliament and allow the president to hand - pick his successor as prime minister			1
those who are close to the current president @entity75 tell me the moderate counter-weight to @entity4 will stay out of the political cross-fire and let this experiment to create a presidential system of government play out			1
but they say a successful transition is not a given			0
but after suffering through a year of intense protests , a barrage of accusations and investigations linked to corruption at the top of his government and a challenge from afar by former ally , the @entity59 based religious leader @entity85 , @entity4 not only seems undeterred , but more emboldened than ever			2
he has grand plans in the works : an expansion of the @entity13 airport to rival @entity100 as the international transfer hub , a brand new bridge across the @entity103 , and a 45 kilometer canal that will run parallel to that @entity106			0
in october last year , @entity4 proudly unveiled the @entity107 connecting @entity2 and @entity3 with an underground train network			0
this infrastructure , he says , will also help sustain growth			0
total gdp today is hovering at nearly $ 850 billion after a three-fold increase in ten years			0
that is projected to nearly double again by 2020 and @entity4 has set a goal for it to cross $ 2 trillion by 2023 , the centennial of the @entity0			1
if achieved , @entity0 would be in the top ten of global economies			0
fabled emerging market author @entity118 , when at investment bank @entity119 , selected @entity0 as a " next 11 " country -- one of the most promising for the next generation of growth			1
whether it can live up to those expectations will depend on prudent financial management , but also on how " @entity129 " conducts relations within the global investment community			0
he and a few cabinet members have made a reputation for jawboning credit rating agencies when they make moves to downgrade the country 's debt rating			1
@entity136 's was the latest to suffer the wrath of @entity138 for treating the country " unfairly			0
" it is not unusual for @entity4 to draw comparisons of his leadership to that of @entity144 , the founder of modern @entity0			2
he wants to secure his place in history			0
whether his desire to do so is ultimately good for his country remains the big unknown as @entity0 go to the polls .			2
