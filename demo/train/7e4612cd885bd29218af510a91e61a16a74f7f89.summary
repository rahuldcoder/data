politicians , journalists and conservative activists will swoop into @entity4 this weekend for a major gathering of republicans that 's widely viewed as the first cattle call this cycle for the @entity10 presidential race			1
close to 10 potential candidates will speak at the daylong @entity13 on saturday , co-hosted by the group @entity14 and rep. @entity15 , a high - profile @entity10 from @entity16 with serious clout among social conservatives			1
with @entity16 the first state to vote in the presidential nominating season , it 's considered a must - stop for @entity25 hopefuls on both sides of the aisle , and this weekend gives 2016 players a chance to roll out their message to core caucus - goers , strategists say			1
among those expected to speak are @entity34 gov. @entity33 , sen. @entity35 of @entity36 , @entity38 gov. @entity37 , former @entity36 gov. @entity39 , former @entity41 gov. @entity40 , renowned neurosurgeon @entity42 , former sen. @entity43 of @entity44 and former @entity46 ceo @entity45			0
notably , the top two potential contenders in the @entity10 race -- @entity49 and @entity50 -- are bypassing the event , both citing scheduling conflicts			1
also skipping @entity16 this weekend are sen. @entity53 of @entity54 , who took a pass on a similar @entity16 gathering of conservatives back in august , and sen. @entity58 of @entity59 , who 's holding his own retreat with donors and supporters in @entity63 this weekend as he prepares to make a 2016 decision			1
@entity58 and @entity53 , however , will join @entity35 to speak at an event in @entity66 , @entity67 , on sunday that 's hosted by a group backed by the @entity69			0
the odd one out ? one of the most highly anticipated speakers is @entity33 , who 's considered the one - not - like - the - others at this weekend 's assembly			2
twice elected in a blue state , @entity33 's staked out more moderate and pragmatic territory on the political spectrum			2
he angered social conservatives when he dropped a legal challenge in 2013 against a court ruling that got rid of @entity34 's same - sex marriage ban			0
he also stirred up some controversy when he at first declined to offer his opinion on the @entity84 's ruling in favor of @entity86 last year , which said private companies can not be required to pay to cover some types of contraceptives for their employees			2
later , while @entity33 was in @entity16 , the governor said he supported the ruling			2
when talking about social issues , @entity33 has largely focused on his efforts to enhance drug rehabilitation programs in his state , especially for non-violent criminals with drug convictions			0
" when we say we 're pro-life , we need to be pro-life for the entire life			0
we need to stand up for the hurt and the wounded , " @entity33 told a religious right audience at a conference organized by the @entity104 last summer			0
the governor has made five trips to @entity16 in the past year , including stops to help raise money for @entity15 and gov. @entity109			1
with @entity50 and @entity49 soaking up much of the attention and resources among establishment republicans , the summit will provide @entity33 a chance to stand out and earn points for simply showing up			0
" in terms of optics , i think its clear that gov. @entity33 intends to run — and has every intention to speaking to as many @entity121 as possible , " said @entity116 , a @entity10 strategist from @entity16			1
" that 's how you build a winning coalition — and he seems to get that			0
" what we 'll be looking for @entity33 has also been mum on his views about immigration reform			0
political observers will be watching to see what candidates say about the issue in @entity16 this week			1
@entity15 , one of the @entity10 's most vocal and flashy opponents of a pathway to citizenship for undocumented workers , made headlines recently when he referred to a guest at the @entity141 as a " deportable			1
" while @entity15 's comments on immigration have agitated even those within his party , he 's still considered popular in his home state and a highly sought after name when candidates stop through @entity16			1
other issues that could get frequent mention this weekend include same - sex marriage and abortion			0
both topics have seen renewed attention in the last week , after the @entity84 decided a week ago to take up same - sex marriage this year			0
the court will essentially decide whether states have the right to ban gay and lesbian couples from getting married			0
related : @entity84 gay marriage decision could have 2016 repercussions also on the social front , the @entity25 , in a battle that pitted @entity10 against each other , passed a measure thursday banning all taxpayer money for abortions after it failed to pass a bill that would ban so - called " late - term " abortions			2
this week also marked the 42nd anniversary of the @entity172 decision , and tens of thousands of anti-abortion rights activists marched in the nation 's capital to bring attention to the issue			1
@entity43 , who battled @entity50 late into the 2012 primary season , tweeted out photos of his family yesterday explaining why they were marching			0
the former senator from @entity44 barely won the @entity16 caucuses in 2012 , edging out @entity50 in a delayed vote count — @entity50 was initially declared the winner — by 34 votes			2
like @entity33 , some @entity10 have also taken on criminal justice reform and anti-poverty policies as key talking points in their platforms			0
we 'll see how potential candidates tackle those issues this weekend , especially as the party on the national level has made efforts to appeal to a wider audience			1
several of the potential candidates plan to stay longer in @entity16			1
@entity40 has book signings on sunday in @entity199 and @entity200 , @entity16 , while @entity39 is staying until monday and @entity43 until tuesday for multiple events throughout the state .			2
