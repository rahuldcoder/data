-- @entity1 and @entity2 never fail to confound @entity3			1
their political and public service accomplishments often appear diminished by the stumbles in their private lives , real or imagined			0
no holder of high office , obviously , is ever judged simply for policy initiatives , and that seems especially true of the @entity11			1
as @entity2 positions herself for a likely 2016 run for president , the scrutiny she will endure extends , inevitably , to her husband			1
journalists and critics on the right will probably have to mine new material , however			0
what happened in @entity22 and the @entity23 have been more topically tortured than @entity24			0
fortunately , for the traffickers of faux outrage , the @entity11 have offered up the @entity27 , a ponderously complex institution that looks like it might be troubled by internecine squabbles , naked ambition , a touch of greed and an almost impossible to identify set of operational boundaries			1
regardless of altruistic goals and achievements , the @entity27 has blended friendships and political relationships along with corporate and nonprofit endeavors in a structure that will feed material into the @entity43 @entity42 commentary complex through the next presidential election cycle			1
@entity45 will likely not cross a room in the next few years without it being framed through the perspective of her unstated political plans to become president			1
news that she was moving with her staff into two floors of the @entity55 , where the @entity27 is located , may be a part of what prompted the @entity58 to publish a detailed account of the nonprofit 's operations and their possible implications for a second @entity45 presidency			1
the former secretary of state is planning initiatives on jobs , women and children under the organization 's new title of the @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity71 , which , undoubtedly , will add to her already substantial resume			2
there are , of course , always legitimate questions for global nongovernmental organizations and potential conflicts between their programs and the profit motives of their large corporate donors			0
increasing her association with the foundation means @entity45 will be judged partly by the operational relationships of an institution that has previously been driven by her husband 's global celebrity and fundraising skills			1
this is not a uniformly positive development			0
during her primary race against president @entity93 , the @entity27 ran a deficit of $ 40 million , possibly because its fundraising was competing with her campaign 's			1
even though the foundation and the associated @entity98 and the @entity99 had operating revenues of $ 214 million last year , it still ended with an $ 8 million deficit			0
the @entity11 are either very astute at navigating the nether world between corporate millions and honorable charity work , or they are still dealing with the bedazzlement of wealth and power and have n't figured out how to clearly understand what is appropriate and ethical			1
the latter can hardly be argued			0
@entity3 presidential politics runs on the billions of multi-national businesses and winning elections is inextricably connected to finessing that dependency to give the converse appearance of independence			0
the @entity58 report suggests the @entity11 are still figuring this out , and regardless of any philanthropic motivations to help with global problems , they may be harmed by their institutional ineptitude			2
one example cited by @entity122 is a consultancy named @entity124 , which was founded by a close associate of @entity45			2
monthly retainer fees were said to be up to $ 250,000 and the former president was a paid advisor , until the bad publicity and collapse of @entity132 's @entity131 investment firm , a significant client			0
@entity2 was reportedly angry about the negative media but it 's unknown if she had previously commented or had ethical concerns regarding @entity124 's recruitment of @entity27 corporate donors to be clients			1
surely , all of this is not without meaning ? well , maybe			0
the @entity11 can not be accused of not trying			2
their political ambitions are as grand as their visions of global philanthropy			0
in just the 2013 meeting of the @entity98 , public and private organizations made more than 70 commitments totaling $ 1.6 billion , estimated to impact about 2 million @entity3 lives			0
the @entity27 has created significant partnerships around the planet to resolve issues related to health and wellness , economic inequality , climate change and childhood obesity			2
execution in all of these endeavors has been , undoubtedly , imperfect , and , yes , @entity2 's public evaluation as a presidential candidate may be connected to some of those shortcomings			1
but the greater failure would be to make no effort to help improve a troubled world			0
perhaps the @entity11 should simply return to @entity167 , @entity22 , rent a little house on a quiet side street and paint self - portrait watercolors			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			2

the @entity27 has come under scrutiny for its operations and finances
@entity179 : as @entity2 will likely run for president , critics are looking for *mistakes*
he says evaluation of @entity45 as a presidential candidate may be tied to the foundation
@entity173 : charity work honorable , but @entity11 need to set boundaries on power , wealth
