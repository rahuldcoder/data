-- here 's something you probably did n't imagine doing today : entering a name - that - pangolin contest			1
but i hope you 'll make room in your busy schedule for a humble and endangered creature that truly could use some help			0
@entity9 is the current name of that shy - looking pangolin in the photo above			1
what kind of name is that for such a rare and fascinating mammal , the modern world 's tiny dinosaur , a " walking pinecone " that can defend itself against lions and tigers by rolling up into a little scale - covered ball ? @entity9 sounds like a line in a spreadsheet			1
he deserves a way better name			0
the generous researchers at @entity30 's @entity29 have agreed to let @entity0 's readers suggest and then vote on a new name for @entity9 , who was recently released back into the wild after being rescued from the black market			1
suggest a name by commenting below			0
you can up - vote the names in the thread you 'd like to be considered			1
i 'll ask readers to vote on five of the best ( non-profane ) and most popular names next week			2
@entity9 will assume whatever name you pick			1
you can also tweet this to encourage friends to vote : pangolins like @entity9 are endangered , and they 're thought to be the most - trafficked mammals in the world			1
as i found out on a recent reporting trip to @entity53 , activists fear that they could go extinct before most people so much as realize they exist			0
they 're shipped around the world for their scales , which are used in traditional medicine , and for their meat , which is a delicacy and status symbol in @entity30 and @entity60			1
you voted for me to research and report on the illegal animal trade as part of my @entity65 project , which focuses on bottom - of - the - list issues and places			2
find more stories in this reader - led series at @entity70			2
on my trip to @entity72 and @entity30 in february , i met @entity9 and other rescued pangolins at the vastly underfunded rehabilitation center in @entity30			1
the group operates on $ 27,000 a year , its manager told me			0
that 's for seven employees at two national parks			0
i also went undercover to talk with mafia - type pangolin traffickers and poachers			1
my take - away is that celebrity would bring the pangolin a form of protection			1
as long as it remains an obscure and little - known creature , it 's easier for pangolin bosses to keep packing up these animals by the tons and shipping them to market			1
and it 's also easier for restaurants to sell pangolin and consumers to justify buying it			2
pangolins are remarkable animals : their tongues are longer than their bodies ; they hang from trees by their tails ; they 're pretty much invincible to predators in the wild			2
it would be unthinkable if they went extinct because they 're not conventionally cute			0
there are easy , workable solutions			0
humans are their biggest threat			0
given the seriousness of the trade , maybe this naming contest seems goofy or inappropriate , but i think of it as a way for @entity0 's audience to adopt a pangolin and to get to know @entity9			1
he 's one of the shyest pangolins the researchers in @entity30 have worked with ( all pangolins are super-shy , by the way , and they actually die of " stress " in captivity , which is why you almost never see them in zoos )			1
he was released into @entity133 on march 19 , and i 'm told he 's making his way into the world with extreme timidity , like a @entity137 walking onto a sheet of ice			1
that 's , of course , understandable considering he was hunted and was likely bound for a restaurant table or a bag of scales before he was seized by the @entity30 government and , luckily , turned over to the researchers			2
when researchers put @entity9 in a box out in the forest and encouraged him to walk away , he just sat there , terrified			2
" with other releases the animal has happily come out the box and started investigating the area			0
@entity9 , however , was lot more nervous , " @entity154 , who 's handling his release , wrote on a blog where she documents the pangolins ' journeys			1
" it is bad practice and stressful to tip the box or lift the animal out			0
better just to leave it open and let them climb out by themselves			0
so , instead , we stood back and waited , but he still did not want to leave			0
" he was still in the box when they left that night , she said			0
the next morning , however , she was relieved to find the box empty			0
the researchers are monitoring @entity9 's movements with a radio tracking device that 's attached to one of the scales on his tail			2
by march 24 , @entity9 had left the den site -- a good sign -- but then " dug himself further under the roots of the tree , " as if to hide , @entity180 wrote in an e-mail			2
" hopefully now he will begin to become more familiar with the surrounding area			0
" you can follow @entity9 's journey on a blog written by @entity180 and other staff at the @entity29 and @entity192 in @entity30			1
i 'll be back in touch with the top five names soon			0
what would you name the pangolin in the photo ? leave your picks in the comments , and vote up the names you like			1
we 'll have a vote on the best of the best soon .			0
