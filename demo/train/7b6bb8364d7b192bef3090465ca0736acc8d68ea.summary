-- no parent should have to worry about losing his or her child in childbirth or to a mosquito bite , malnutrition or vaccine - preventable diseases such as pneumonia and diarrhea			1
yet , in some parts of the world , these are leading killers			0
in 2010 , 7.6 million children younger than 5 died worldwide -- the equivalent of the combined populations of @entity16 and @entity17			1
the good news is we have the tools to prevent most of these deaths			0
vaccines , adequate nutrition , improved health care services and training for workers , anti-malaria bed nets and other high - impact mechanisms can save lives			1
the challenge is making them widely available and easily accessible in impoverished and underserved communities			0
in recent decades , the global community has made significant progress in saving children 's lives			0
since 1990 , the mortality rate for children younger than 5 has decreased by 35 % worldwide , and more than a dozen countries have reduced their rate by more than 50 %			1
yet , too many children continue to die , and we have more work to do , especially in @entity44 and @entity45 , where child mortality rates are the highest			0
to achieve the fourth @entity47 , which calls for reducing the mortality rate of children younger than 5 by two - thirds between 1990 and 2015 , we need to accelerate our efforts			1
although we have many solutions in hand , we need to strengthen financing , policies , health care systems and service delivery to give more children the chance to survive and thrive			1
this week , the @entity60 will join governments , the private sector and civil society organizations for a summit in @entity65 focused on ending preventable child deaths			2
experts will identify effective child survival strategies and investments and will serve as the launch pad for activities to assess progress and sustain momentum toward this important goal			0
one of the promising efforts is mobile technology , which can provide health information directly to families and assist health care workers with clinical decisions and diagnostics			1
the @entity60 's @entity82 has been leading the working group on mobile health and child survival			2
it will develop recommendations on how to apply mobile technologies for health			0
this summit complements the work of the @entity60 to dramatically improve the health of women and children around the globe			1
one program is its " @entity101 " initiative , which aims to save the lives of 16 million women and children by 2015			2
nearly two years ago , the @entity60 joined the @entity101 effort with our own $ 400 million commitment to maternal , newborn and child health through 2015			2
we have provided nearly $ 200 million in grants to @entity60 agencies and other partners , launched two new multistakeholder initiatives and engaged more than 300 partners and hundreds of thousands of individual people in efforts to reduce child deaths			2
working with our partners , the @entity60 delivers lifesaving vaccines and insecticide - treated bed nets to children , harnesses mobile technologies to improve maternal and child health , provides opportunities for women to voluntarily plan their families , empowers girls to build the future they want and provides clean cooking stoves that are safe and healthy for families and the environment			1
these efforts are making a difference : in less than a decade , we have sent more than 6 million anti-malaria bed nets to @entity44 , helped to reduce global polio cases by 99 % and helped to decrease measles mortality by 74 % worldwide			1
through smart , coordinated and committed action , the world could be on the cusp of something truly remarkable -- ending preventable child deaths			0
this goal is ambitious , but it 's one that we can , and must , achieve			0
now is the time for all of us -- governments , businesses , civil society and concerned citizens -- to seize this opportunity and fulfill our obligation to give all children an opportunity to celebrate a fifth birthday			0
