you need look no further than the glut of beautiful , young and immortal vampires and permanently incapacitated zombies overpopulating our culture to see that @entity7 has issues when it comes to aging			1
we want to be forever vital , self - sufficient and powerful , like the vampires of " @entity12 , " and we are fearful of aging into the semi-sentient zombies of " @entity14			2
" the good news is , when it comes to thinking about how we age , taking action early significantly increases one 's odds for a better result and aging on our own terms			0
caregiving for loved ones the ' new normal ' for boomers so , as you think about the new year and you get together with your family , let 's have " the talk " -- the adult version of the birds and the bees -- a discussion of how we want to care for our parents and how we ourselves , in the prime of our lives , want to age , and how to accomplish those goals with long - term care planning			1
staying silent could mean getting caught off guard			0
that 's what happened to my family			0
when my dad was 50 , he won our local golf and tennis championship and was diagnosed with lymphoma , all within a matter of days			0
life can change that fast , and failing to plan only makes painful surprises more painful			2
later , when my mother fell ill , my brothers and i had the ability to take time from work to care for her and provide help when we were unable			2
many families do n't have this kind of flexibility			0
the time and cost of caring for a loved one can be both rewarding beyond measure and financially and emotionally debilitating			0
according to the @entity66 , 70 % of those who reach 65 years old will need long - term care of some kind			1
the time to plan is now , and planning begins with family discussions about what many of us will need as we age			2
uncovering the secrets of a longer life long - term care is not end - of - life care			1
millions of older adults rely on it for help with day - to - day activities -- everything from getting dressed in the morning to cleaning the house to running the most basic errands			2
the majority of that care occurs in the home , and who does n't want to say in their home ? this care is in increasingly high demand in large part because of how much longer and fuller older @entity7 ' lives have become thanks to a half - century of advances in health and medicine			1
in short , our increased life spans have also increased the likelihood of suffering from certain diseases and conditions that often require long - term care -- from @entity106 's or dementia to a heart attack or stroke			1
the 10 warning signs of @entity106 's families need to plan ahead because the cost of long - term care can get extremely expensive -- especially for nursing home care , with median costs of $ 87,000 a year nationally and even higher			1
even when friends or family provide " unpaid " care , they often spend their own money and give up their personal time and even jobs to do so			2
many people mistakenly believe that @entity122 or the @entity123 cover long - term care			1
neither do the vast majority of health insurance policies			0
that 's why it 's so important to have a plan			0
this year , i partnered with @entity131 to launch the " @entity133 " tour to raise awareness about the importance and benefits of long - term care planning			1
as an alternative to paying out of pocket , long - term care insurance reimburses you for some of the cost of that care			1
the most important conversation you 'll ever have more important than how we choose to plan ahead is that we chose to do it			0
getting the advice we need starts with taking the time to sit down with loved ones and have the necessary talk about how we want to age			0
sure , it 's not exactly a traditional conversation for the new year , but having it is an indication of your care and an articulation of your love			0
in that light , this time of year is the perfect time to have the talk about long - term care			1
if you 're watching vampires and zombies , like my family will be , go ahead and take advantage of that next commercial break to have " the talk			0
