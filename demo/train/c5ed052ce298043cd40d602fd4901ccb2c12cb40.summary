-- on december 16 , a young medical student in one of @entity4 's major cities was gang - raped , her body destroyed by the bodies of the men who allegedly assaulted her and also by the rusting metal bar doctors say they used to penetrate her			1
the bar removed part of her intestines			0
the rest were removed in a hospital far from home where she struggled for her life for just a few days			2
it has taken an attack that lies nearly outside of comprehension to prompt demonstrations , but the outcry has begun			2
over the weekend , women rose up in @entity25 , protesting outside the prime minister 's house against gender - based violence			1
what are your experiences of being a woman in @entity4 ? send us your stories @entity37 women have faced ceaseless sexualized violence since the start of that country 's revolution , but are now protesting to stop the ever - present sexual harassment and assault			1
according to @entity46 , the head of @entity48 and @entity49 , a movement calling for women to rise up on february 14 , 2013 , and demand an end to violence , women in @entity45 are planning what may be their first - ever major demonstrations against rape and violence			1
@entity46 will be in @entity58 jan. 4 and @entity59 jan. 7 and will meet with activists and leaders for events aimed at raising awareness of the movement			0
this groundswell -- what @entity46 calls " a catalytic moment " -- is the perfect chance for us to consider how we think about subjugation , rape , and degradation of women globally			1
@entity73 and i have written about how a cult of masculinity is behind the constant violation of women around the world -- that some men brutalize women against their own self - interest because of an addiction to control or domination			2
to put it plainly : rape is not about sex			0
opinion : misogyny in @entity4 -- we are all guilty " rape is about violence , " @entity73 says , " proving ' masculine ' superiority ; often inserting guns and other objects into women 's bodies ; playing out hostility to other men by invading the bodies of ' their ' females , including old women and babies ; occupying wombs with sperm of a conquering group ; owning female bodies as the means of reproduction ; and raping men and boys to make them as inferior as females			1
" this is born out everywhere that rape occurs but especially in war zones like the @entity116 , where dr. @entity117 , the medical director of @entity118 , told me men use objects as a means to mark a woman -- to indicate that she now carries the message of violence impressed on her body			1
she becomes an emblem of terror meant to warn the world that nobody is safe			0
and while rape in war zones carries its own particular kind of horror , there is no escaping the cult of masculinity geographically			1
the culture of rape imbues whatever space we inhabit			1
for women , " peacetime " does not exist			0
nearly 1 in 5 women in this country surveyed said they had been raped or had experienced an attempted rape at some point , according to the @entity147 and @entity148			1
that women are expected to put up and shut up is universally understood : a 2012 @entity151 report found that 57 percent of @entity4 boys and 53 percent of girls between ages of 15 and 19 think wife - beating is justified			1
a recent study by two nonprofits found that 65 percent of men surveyed in the @entity116 believe " women should accept partner violence to keep the family together			2
" and , as in @entity4 , where the appalling remarks of @entity165 chief @entity164 appeared to place blame on the @entity59 gang - rape victim -- she chose a strange private bus , she should n't have been out after dark -- politicians , clergymen , husbands , and others around the world perpetually blame rape survivors			1
( see this beauty from an @entity177 priest			0
or reacquaint yourself with the stunners from rep. @entity180 or @entity182 candidate @entity181			0
) these are more than just manipulative words ; victim - blaming has consequences			0
women are literally dying from fault - finding from @entity189 to @entity190 in honor killings , suicides , and murders because they are blamed for their sexual assaults			0
we have to move the focus off the victim			0
@entity4 prime minister @entity198 has said that the " safety and security of women is of the highest concern to our government			1
that 's one part of the equation			0
but what about the larger part -- what about prosecuting men who are committing these crimes ? yes , women often do not report sexualized violence			1
but they do not report because they know that , at least in this country , only three of every 100 men accused of rape will ever spend a day in jail			0
it 's time to focus on the perpetrators			0
and it 's also time for men and women to engage in a consistent dialogue on stopping rape			2
let 's publicly and privately declare all sexualized violence unacceptable			1
let 's hold perpetrators legally accountable and once and for all change laws and justice systems that continue to fail women			0
let 's understand that rape is not a problem that affects only women : it affects families , communities , entire cultures			2
it is not an inevitability , but the outcome of a system based in discrimination , just as slavery was			0
let 's declare 2013 @entity247 to end rape			2
if this is a problem that men have created , this is a problem that men can help solve			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity257 .			2

@entity257 : brutal rape that killed an @entity4 women has caused a global outcry
in @entity45 , women are planning protest next month against gender violence
she says acceptance of rape culture in *domestic* life and war is *rampant*
@entity257 : in 2013 , make all sexualized violence unacceptable
