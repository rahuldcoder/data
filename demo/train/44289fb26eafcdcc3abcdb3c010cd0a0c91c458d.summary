-- @entity3 researchers have identified a new human immunodeficiency virus , the first derived from gorillas , a report said monday			1
a new virus is difficult to detect by tests because it is not closely related to the other three @entity9 variants			1
the three previous @entity9 variants came from chimpanzees			2
the new findings indicate that gorillas , in addition to chimpanzees , are likely sources of @entity9 , the researchers concluded in a report published in the weekly @entity20 journal			1
the new virus , called @entity22 168 , was detected in a 62 - year - old woman who moved to @entity24 , @entity3 , from the western @entity26 nation of @entity27 , the report says			1
she tested positive for @entity9 in 2004 , and researchers led by @entity30 identified the virus as being closely related to a recently discovered simian immunodeficiency virus ( @entity32 )			1
the new gorilla virus " has many of the biological properties necessary for human infection , " the report says			1
" the human case described here does not seem to be an isolated incident , as before coming to @entity24 the subject had lived in the semiurban area of @entity43 , the capital of @entity27 , and reported no contact with apes or bush meat , " the researchers said			1
that would indicate that the woman contracted the virus from another human			1
the significance of the latest findings is difficult to determine without more information , said @entity54 , who co-discovered @entity9 in 1984			2
" it 's yet to be known , " @entity54 said			0
" it could be zero			0
... let 's see a more full report on this individual and let 's see wider testing			0
" @entity62 , director of the @entity63 , calls the latest @entity9 variant " an oddity " but said it 's not surprising that it cropped up , because the virus has been circulating in non-human primates for centuries			1
the three previous @entity9 variants are labeled m , @entity71 and @entity72 the new one has been classified @entity74 the @entity71 variants , @entity62 said , are extremely rare			0
" it 's not significant unless it establishes itself as a predominant strain , " he said			0
" we have not seen that with @entity71 and @entity72 " @entity62 lumps the new p variant with the rare group because it has been detected in only one patient			0
if it were widespread , @entity62 said , " we would already know about it			0
when these things happen , you see a lot of them around			0
" even if the new variant proves lethal , it 's not likely to increase @entity93 infections , said @entity54 , director of the @entity94 at the @entity95			0
there are so many @entity9 variations , he said , that one more is not likely to make a difference			0
the new virus is difficult to detect by conventional tests because it is not closely related to the other three @entity9 variants			2
" this demonstrates that @entity9 evolution is an ongoing process , " co-researcher @entity103 of the @entity104 said in a release			0
" the virus can jump from species to species , from primate to primate , and that includes us ; pathogens have been with us for millions of years and routinely switch host species			2
" @entity9 can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome , which attacks the body 's immune system , giving rise to lethal infections			0
patients diagnosed with @entity9 can take medications to delay or stop @entity9 from developing into @entity93			0
there are 33 million confirmed cases of @entity93 worldwide			0
the unnamed woman has no signs of @entity93 and remains untreated , @entity20 said			2
the most likely explanation for the emergence of the new virus is gorilla - to - human transmission , though researchers say they can not rule out the possibility that the chimpanzee @entity32 gave rise to the new strain " either indirectly by transmission to gorillas and then to humans or directly by transmission to humans and also to gorillas			1
" researchers said they do n't know how widespread the virus is among humans			2
" the human prevalence of this new lineage remains to be determined , " the report says , adding that " it could be circulating unnoticed in @entity27 or elsewhere			1
" @entity26 bears close watching , the researchers suggest			0
" in conclusion , our findings indicate that gorillas , in addition to chimpanzees , are likely sources of hiv - 1 , " the report states			1
" the discovery of this novel @entity9 - 1 lineage highlights the continuing need to watch closely for the emergence of new @entity9 variants , particularly in western @entity163 , the origin of all existing @entity9 - 1 groups			1
" co-researcher @entity103 noted that the new virus may not be restricted to @entity26			2
" it also highlights how human mobility can rapidly transfer a virus from one geographical location to another as has been dramatically evident with the recent emergence of swine flu , " he said .			1

@entity174 is the first known to be derived from gorillas
62 - year - old woman who moved to @entity24 from @entity27 found to have @entity22 168
likely explanation for emergence of new virus is gorilla - to - human transmission
