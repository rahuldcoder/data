-- a federal judge friday ruled in favor of a former @entity4 college basketball star who sued to end the @entity6 's control over the rights to college athletes ' names , images and likenesses			1
in a landmark decision , @entity13 district judge @entity12 sided with @entity15 in his lawsuit against the @entity6			1
@entity15 argued athletes in the top tier of college basketball and football should be allowed to profit from their schools ' use of their likenesses			1
in a 99 - page ruling , @entity12 wrote that current @entity6 rules " unreasonably restrain trade in the market for certain educational and athletic opportunities offered by @entity29 schools			1
" @entity12 issued an injunction to block the @entity6 from prohibiting its member schools and conferences from offering their @entity29 or @entity29 basketball recruits a limited share of the revenues generated from the use of their names , images , and likenesses			1
she did rule , however , that the @entity6 could set a cap on the money paid to athletes , as long as it allows at least $ 5,000 per athlete per year			1
" the @entity6 's witnesses stated that their concerns about student - athlete compensation would be minimized or negated if compensation was capped at a few thousand dollars per year , " the judge wrote			1
@entity15 's suit alleged the waivers the athletes are required to sign are illegal and asked that players be able to collectively negotiate the terms of their likenesses in order to keep a share of those profits			2
" before the court in this case is only whether the @entity6 violates antitrust law by agreeing with its member schools to restrain their ability to compensate @entity29 men 's basketball and @entity29 football players any more than the current association rules allow , " @entity12 wrote			1
" for the reasons set forth above , the court finds that this restraint does violate antitrust law			0
" the ruling could potentially change college sports drastically , eventually forcing the @entity6 to restructure its amateur model and allow college athletes to be paid			1
@entity6 chief legal officer @entity75 said : " we disagree with the court 's decision that @entity6 rules violate antitrust laws			2
we note that the court 's decision sets limits on compensation , but are reviewing the full decision and will provide further comment later			0
" @entity86 , an attorney for the plaintiffs , called the ruling " a big step forward for common decency			2
" " one of the things the judge is saying here ... is some sharing is ok , " he said			2
" it wo n't affect amateurism , wo n't affect the popularity of the sport			0
she made a very reasonable and significant and measured decision			0
" @entity102 , president of the @entity103 , said the ruling was " a big win " that signaled " the time for college athletes to get their due , " though he was critical of the $ 5,000 compensation cap			1
" the ruling says the @entity6 was operating illegally and college athletes do have rights , " said @entity110 , who helped find players to join the case			1
" even if you label them student - athletes and want to call it amateurism , it does n't give the @entity6 the right to deny them the rights that other @entity13 deserve			1
" @entity121 , who started the lawsuit by introducing @entity15 and lead attorney @entity123 , said the decision was precedent - setting			0
" the key is , they 're allowed to get paid , " said @entity125 , who helped pioneer branding athletes by putting @entity128 shoes on @entity129			2
@entity125 called the decision his most important career accomplishment			0
" it 's more important to me that these kids won and this go forward and the principles are right , " he said			0
" to me , it 's more important than the @entity139 and @entity140 and things i did in my professional life			0
... this was just something that was wrong and i totally believed in it			0
" the judge wrote that the injunction will not affect student - athletes who enroll in college before july 1 , 2016			1
when athletes commit to a university , players are required to sign a waiver that relinquishes their right to their own likenesses in every form			2
that means they ca n't make money off their television appearances , their jerseys , or in any other way			0
the universities get any revenues from selling sports paraphernalia or other material related to the players			0
the trial began june 9 in federal court in @entity168 , @entity169			0
the plaintiffs were 20 current and former student athletes who play or played for an @entity29 football or @entity29 men 's basketball team starting in 1956			2
legal appeals could delay a final outcome for years but the decision is in a position to be the first major @entity6 reform effort to take hold			2
already the issues brought up in the case have had an effect , even before the ruling was made			0
@entity183 , the @entity184 and @entity185 have decided to stop selling jerseys with the numbers of specific players			0
instead , @entity183 will sell the number 12 jersey , in keeping with its 12th man tradition ; and @entity191 will sell jerseys with numbers that correspond to the year of competition -- 14 for this year , according to a school spokesman			0
@entity185 will sell only jersey number 51 , in honor of its head coach , @entity199 , and legendary @entity201 linebacker @entity198			0
the @entity6 's argument in both the ongoing @entity15 suit and another one filed by former quarterback @entity204 , also in federal court in @entity168 , is that it is trying to protect the amateur model of college sports			1
paying college athletes would hurt traditions , @entity6 chief testifies @entity6 under fire : 5 things to know @entity6 faces change , legal challenges in months ahead			1

the judge sides with an *ex-ucla* college basketball star who challenged the @entity6
the @entity6 says college athletes are amateurs , rewarded with an education
the ruling could potentially change college sports drastically
