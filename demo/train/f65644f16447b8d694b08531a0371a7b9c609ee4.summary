-- when a @entity3 cardinal presented a message from @entity5 to the @entity6 , it might have been the first time a papal message actually has been read out in @entity8 , but it certainly was n't the first time a @entity5 has spoken out on economic justice			1
read more -- @entity5 to @entity8 elite ' do more for poor ' beginning in the late 19th century , almost a dozen @entity12 have issued a long series of documents devoted to defense of the poor which are known as " catholic social teaching			1
" all that moral leadership , however , has not produced a notably more just world			0
a recent estimate by @entity22 , a @entity23 - based charitable group , claims that 85 people on earth control as much wealth as the bottom half of the world 's population , despite 120 years of papal exhortations			0
is there any reason to believe that @entity5 could make a difference where so many of his predecessors have n't ? the surprising answer is yes , just maybe			1
to begin , the first @entity5 from the developing world brings a degree of credibility on matters of economic justice that other world leaders lack			2
that 's not merely because of his origins , but because of his lifestyle choices in favor of simplicity and humility			0
this is the @entity5 , after all , who famously spurned a papal limo to take the bus after his election with the other cardinals , who wears the same brown shoes he sported in @entity55 , and who rejected the papal apartment in favor of a modest room in a @entity3 residence for clergy			2
his aversion to ostentation is already the stuff of legend , so when @entity5 talks of a " poor church for the poor , " people take him seriously			1
@entity5 also has amassed massive deposits of political capital over his first 10 months in office , with approval ratings around the world that politicians and celebrities have to view with unalloyed envy			2
that 's why , for instance , political leaders these days are beating a path to the @entity5 's door			2
@entity5 recently welcomed @entity84 president @entity83 , he 'll meet @entity86 president @entity85 on friday , and the @entity87 announced today that @entity89 president @entity88 will make a pilgrimage to the @entity3 to meet @entity5 on march 27			1
what 's the subject for the @entity88 / @entity5 summit ? according to a @entity87 statement , it 's " their shared commitment to fighting poverty and growing inequality			2
" in many ways @entity5 has become the new @entity100 , meaning the world 's leading source of moral authority			1
the difference in the @entity5 's case is that he combines personal charisma with the institutional authority of leading the world 's largest christian church , with more than 1.2 billion followers in every corner of the planet			1
@entity113 is also the only world religion with its own diplomatic corps , as the @entity3 is a sovereign state with bilateral relations with 180 nations			0
that gives the church a unique platform to act as a voice of conscience in global affairs			0
in other words , @entity5 has some serious cards to lay on the table in the high - stakes poker game of global economic reform			0
it 's easy to say that no one person -- even a pope who 's also one of the most popular figures on the planet -- can bring down entrenched systems of power			0
of course , that 's what people said about @entity139 too , before @entity140 set the dominoes in motion in @entity143 that led to the collapse of the @entity146 system in 1989			0
whether @entity5 will have the same luck defending the poor remains to be seen , but it 's certainly not obvious that the smart money is against him			0

pope @entity5 sent a message to those gathered in @entity8 , read out by a @entity174
@entity170 says it follows a long line of " catholic social teaching " documents
but @entity170 says it is possible that @entity5 can make a difference where others have failed
the @entity5 has personal charisma and the authority of leading 1.2 billion people , he says
