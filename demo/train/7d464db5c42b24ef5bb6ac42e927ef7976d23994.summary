-- it feels as if i 've been living a double life all of these years , and i do not want to deceive you , or myself , any longer			2
the burden has become too heavy , the struggle to deny my true self , too great			2
in order to be free i have tell you something			2
i know ; i should have told you sooner			2
after all , i 've already shared with you that i am gay and well , we all know a person ca n't be both			1
at least that 's how it feels the conversation is usually framed : there 's a black community and a gay community , and the two conflict and do not mix. since president @entity22 voiced support for marriage equality and now the board of the @entity26 has followed suit , the narrative is that the black community is trying to make room at the table for gay people			1
allow me to correct this storyline : no one is making room for gay people , gay people have always been at the table , at the forefront			1
what @entity22 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and others have done over the past week is simply acknowledge life is not an " either / or " proposition but rather an emphatic " and			2
" boxes are for shoes , not people			2
so while compartmentalizing folks makes it easier to herd people into target groups and voting blocs , it 's a gross misrepresentation of the reality of humanity			0
and despite the efforts of black religious conservatives to ignore that intersection , the truth is that intersection is a major part of black culture			1
it 's in our literature ( @entity65 ) , our films ( @entity67 ) , in politics , baseball fields ( @entity70 ) , the @entity71 ( @entity72 ) and the civil rights movement ( @entity74 )			0
that intersection exists in our hair salons , barbershops and , yes , even our churches			0
before becoming a journalist , i worked in youth ministry in two churches in my early 20s			0
i lived with one of my pastors and his family and would study the @entity85 for hours on end under his tutelage			0
i poured my heart out to the kids in the congregation			0
on occasion i even would fall asleep on the steps of the altar worshipping my @entity94			0
and yes , i am a @entity95			0
i also know i was not the only gay , black man in ministry desperately trying to pray the gay away			1
in fact , i know one prominent choir director who finally had the courage to come out not too long ago			1
this is the messy and beautiful reality of humanity			0
the @entity104 , a fringe anti-gay think tank , actually had outlined a plan to try to race bait the black community into fighting with ... itself			1
" @entity104 's memos detailed its campaign to direct money to a handful of @entity116 clergy in order to attack gay and lesbian couples that have made a lifelong promise to one another , " said @entity109 , the executive director of the @entity110			1
" the organization admitted their key goal is to drive a wedge between gays and blacks			1
" but i am black , and i am gay			1
a wedge can not be driven between parts of my being			0
i was talking with @entity130 hall of famer @entity131 this past weekend , and he told me something that made a lot of sense			0
he said , in the fight for equality , you must be willing to run a race in which you may not be around to see the finish line			0
not necessarily a pick - me - up , but filled with truth nonetheless			0
we are just beginning to have this conversation about sexual orientation and gender identity within the black community , but it is long overdue			1
a study conducted by the @entity150 found that african - american and @entity152 young people " are overrepresented " in the population of runaways			0
the study also found that between 20 % and 40 % of all homeless youth identify themselves as lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender or questioning			1
many say they were kicked out of their homes or ran away because of violence			0
even on the streets these children are much more likely than others to be abused			0
how can the black community heal if it turns a blind eye to its own children ? it does n't make any sense			1
blacks trying to separate the gay community from blacks ? well , that makes even less sense			1
after all , a house divided against itself can not stand , and gay people are , and always will be , living in this house			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			1

@entity182 : @entity116 , gay communities treated as if they are totally separate
but @entity187 says he identifies as black and gay and both *aspects* are integrated
@entity187 : gays and lesbians have always played a prominent role in the black community
he says black community must resist attempts to turn it against its gay *members*
