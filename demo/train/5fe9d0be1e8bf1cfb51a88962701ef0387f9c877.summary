@entity0 , @entity1 -- desperate times call for a tall , cool glass of creativity in this patch of @entity1 where water is scarce and quickly disappearing			1
but a plan to pump millions of new gallons of drinking water into the system has many people across @entity1 holding their noses			1
this week construction started on a $ 13 million water - reclamation facility			1
that 's a fancy way of describing a treatment plant that will turn sewage wastewater into drinking water			1
" that 's not something i even want to think about , " said @entity19 , a @entity0 resident			0
" it really does n't sound too good			0
" there are three major reservoirs that provide drinking water for half a million people who live around @entity27 , @entity1			1
but the drought is draining those lakes and threatens to create major water shortages in the months ahead			2
this is an age - old problem in the dust - hardened landscape of @entity1			1
for decades , oil has flowed strongly out of the ground here , but the hunt for water is a more difficult game			2
this is where @entity40 comes in			0
he 's the director of the @entity42 , a government agency providing water for cities and towns including @entity46 , @entity27 , @entity47 , @entity0 and @entity48			0
@entity40 is essentially the salesman of the water - reclamation project			1
basically he has to reassure people they 're not going to be drinking their own urine			0
" i see a lot of humor in it , " @entity40 said			0
" there was a fella over in @entity27 that i heard made the comment that at least he gets to drink his beer twice now			0
" twelve years ago , @entity40 thought it was crucial to develop new sources of drinking water			0
water reclamation was gaining in popularity ; the specially treated wastewater is most often used to supply water for industrial uses and watering landscapes , like golf courses			1
@entity40 says water - reclamation technology has improved greatly and will be a vital part of providing drinking water for parts of the country struggling to keep reservoirs full			1
the water - reclamation process involves a complex series of treatment			1
the water will be disinfected , de-mineralized , disinfected again and mixed with water from the reservoir and then re-treated again			0
" we live in a drought - prone area			1
you need to look at other alternatives , and that 's the unique thing about this , " said @entity40			0
one of the reservoirs that provide water is @entity90 near the town of @entity92			2
the lake is on the only source of drinking water for the town of 1,000 people			1
that lake is at less than 1 % of capacity			0
deep , dried - out crevices are easily visible across the lake bottom			0
when full , the water in the @entity103 can be 83 feet deep			0
today , there are only splotches of water across the dried - out land			2
@entity92 mayor @entity108 says the lake will stop providing water in the next six months			2
he does n't have the budget to build a water - reclamation plant , but the mayor wishes he could build one of these plants even if it does n't sit well with residents			1
" i think that 'll be the coming for all of us in the desert @entity120 , " @entity108 said			0
" turn the water off and see how long it takes for people to get thirsty			1
" the @entity125 will be finished by late next year			0
@entity40 says the plant will provide 2 million gallons of new water for his sprawling district			2
on average , the @entity42 provides 65 million gallons of water every day			2
but if drought conditions continue into next year , that water supply will have to be cut down to about 45 million gallons a day			1
there are also plans to develop two other water reclamation plants in the area , and @entity40 says when all three plants are finished , they could provide 20 % of the area 's drinking water			2
@entity40 has heard all the jokes such as , " people are drinking pee			0
" and they get more unappealing than that one			0
but not only does @entity40 say the water will be safe to drink , he says it will actually taste better than @entity1 ' notoriously bad - tasting water			1
" it will actually go through three water treatment processes before it gets back into the water system , " @entity40 said			0
" it really will be good - quality water			2
" @entity40 says he 'll be more than happy to be the first person in @entity1 to pour himself a cold glass of wastewater - turned - drinking - water .			1

in drought - stricken @entity1 , wastewater is seen by some as a vital *resource*
construction begins this week on a $ 13 million water - reclamation facility
despite *perceptions* , one small - town mayor says wastewater may be the wave of the future
" turn the water off and see how long it takes for people to get thirsty , " he says
