you can find the ideological divide in @entity2 at almost any gas station			2
a hummer rolls in and fills up for just $ 2 and its owner gives a thumbs - up			0
@entity8 's gas subsidies have given this country the cheapest gas prices in the world			1
but just after him , a middle class , middle - aged father rolls in for a fill up and tells us , " it 's disgusting ; it ca n't go on like this , " referring to the $ 12 billion @entity8 's government pays annually to subsidize gas in @entity2			1
few men or policies have so divided a country , a continent , a hemisphere , but president @entity8 and his so - called " @entity26 " revolution is contentious whether at the gas station or the @entity28			1
how he fares in @entity2 's elections on sunday will underscore his legacy as either a self - styled @entity33 @entity32 or a shrewd autocrat using and abusing his country 's oil riches to stay in power			1
and the world is watching			0
" we 've reached the point where the current situation can not continue , " said economist @entity39 with @entity40 in @entity41			0
@entity8 , @entity45 enter home stretch in @entity2 presidential race oil is everything to @entity2 , accounting for more than 95 % of its exports			1
and yet oil production has slowed for almost a decade			0
add to that a rising inflation rate , crumbling infrastructure , energy shortages everywhere outside the capital , @entity56 , and private sector and foreign investment growth remain low			0
" the continuation of the current policy framework could culminate in a crisis , a balance of payments crisis , perhaps a default			0
whereas @entity2 does have great potential , it has the biggest proven oil reserves in the world and investment has been lagging behind and there is plenty of room for development , " @entity39 said			2
" so investors are obviously sitting , waiting for signs , and @entity2 could be a much better bet than it has been			2
" @entity8 has overseen a radical rethink of the economy in @entity2			1
by nationalizing many industries , especially energy , his government claims to be fashioning a socialist revolution where the poor are given housing , education and medicine free from the state			2
and despite the economy 's challenges , many leaders in @entity33 compliment and indeed may wish to emulate @entity8 's policies , especially nationalization			1
leaders in @entity93 and @entity94 have even praised @entity8 for standing up to " imperialism , " a not - so - veiled reference to @entity98 influence and power in @entity100 and @entity101			2
for his part , president @entity102 has insisted that he does not see a " national security impact " on the @entity98 from @entity8 's policies			1
but @entity107 @entity106 sen. @entity106 has characterized the @entity8 government as a menace in the region and president @entity102 as naive for not recognizing it			1
" @entity8 is not only a threat to the @entity2 people 's freedom and democratic aspirations , he has also supported @entity119 's regime in its attempts to expand its intelligence network throughout the hemisphere , facilitated money laundering activities that finance state sponsors of terrorism and provided a safe haven for @entity128 narco - terrorists , among many other actions , " @entity106 said in a statement released this summer			1
@entity2 : a model for @entity33 ? on wednesday @entity106 told @entity131 it 's essential the @entity2 election proceed as free and fair			1
" i will say that we as believers in democracy , and not just those of us in the @entity98 , but all the democracies in the region need to insist on is that the election results are respected , that the election results are fair , that there is no undermining of the election , that there is no intimidation of voters			0
on that we should be very clear and very firm , and then the results are up to the people of @entity2 , and we wish them well , " he said			2
indeed , @entity8 's vocal support for the @entity151 regime and his close relationship with @entity119 will only grow stronger and bolder if he is re-elected for a six - year term			1
while his challenger , @entity45 , says his foreign policy priorities will be much different , his win could destabilize what is already a fractious society and an unreliable military leadership			0
@entity45 told @entity131 he does n't believe there will be any destabilization inside @entity2 if he wins , and he challenges the notion that only @entity8 can speak for the poor			1
" this is a big lie			0
it is unfortunate that many times , some people have this perception that in @entity2 , the poor are with the government and those who are not poor are not with the government			2
it is a great misconception , a falsehood , " @entity45 said in may			0
the effects of this election may well be felt at the gas station first , and not just those in @entity2			0
the country is an @entity178 member and is still a significant supplier of oil to the @entity98			0
as economists have already warned , an oil price shock triggered by @entity2 unrest is unlikely , but still a possibility			0
savvy authoritarians : meet the modern strongmen			0
