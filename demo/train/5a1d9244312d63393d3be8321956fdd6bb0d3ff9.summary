-- a single braid down the back , a light hunting jacket , a pair of sturdy leather shoes and a small golden pin ; not exactly a culmination of things you would call fashionable			0
but these are the key accessories to one of the hottest new characters to hit the big screen : @entity14			1
@entity14 , the arrow - slinging , tribute - hunting teenager from the upcoming movie " @entity18 , " based on @entity17 ' bestselling book , has made a huge style splash on the @entity20			1
dozens of " how - to - dress like @entity14 " web pages , blog posts and articles are being bookmarked and pinned up by girls of all ages			1
but when did hunting gear and cotton dresses become so fashionable ? for the same reason the little black dress from @entity32 's " breakfast at @entity31 " is still a staple today : it 's not just the look that audiences are responding to , but what that character represents , explains @entity41 's news fashion editor , @entity42			2
in the case of @entity14 , " @entity18 " costume designer @entity43 kept in mind that the character 's style had to tell the story of a distinctively strong young woman who does n't yet know her own strength			1
after all , @entity43 says , @entity14 is a character who 's " just trying to survive			1
" so when she created those costumes , she looked to the past for inspiration , creating items for @entity14 ' home of @entity56 by incorporating themes from the @entity58			1
as a result , " katniss has practical clothes -- it has to make sense where she got them , " @entity43 says			0
" @entity65 is @entity67 work wear , and that is what she would wear while she hunted			0
" @entity14 is n't the only recent movie character to rev up the fashion scene			1
" @entity71 's " @entity72 enthralled viewers with her distinctive punk style , and even " @entity76 's " @entity75 gained fashion popularity with her simple wedding dress seen in " @entity79 " and @entity80 coast fashion			2
" @entity71 's " dark urban look was recreated for consumers by @entity84 retailer @entity83 , which released a limited edition @entity72 - inspired line , featuring key leather pieces , torn and worn shirts and hoodies , all tied together with an industrial color scheme			2
one @entity94 store sold out of the line in 10 minutes after the line went on sale , according to " @entity71 's " costume designer , @entity97 , who worked in conjunction with @entity83 to create the line			1
@entity41 's @entity42 also notes how that theme resonated on the runway during the fall fashion season in 2011			0
" for so long , designers were collaborating with mass retailers , [ but ] a new trend could be costume designers collaborating with mass retailers to create [ a ] character - inspired wardrobe			2
it almost seems like a no - brainer			0
" and yet , while @entity97 created a character - inspired line with @entity72 , @entity43 said that 's currently not her intention			0
" i did n't want the fashion to take over , [ because ] that is not what the movie is about , " she said			2
" the movie is about a girl 's journey			0
that is what a costume designer does , we tell the character 's story			1
" whether the clothing ends up being crafted specifically for fans or not , it 's always that story told through a character 's costume that the consumers cling to			0
to dress like @entity14 , in some regard , is to adopt her trademark characteristics , and the popularity of her clothing points to a characterization that 's hit home			1
" there was a time when being powerful and being pretty were mutually exclusive , and these strong female archetypes are becoming really popular and girls are really responding to that , " says @entity42			0
@entity145 entertainment editor @entity144 agrees , positing out that the look and feel of characters like @entity14 and @entity72 are so appealing to audiences because these characters are in charge of their own destinies			1
" i think these characters struck the right time in pop culture , " @entity144 said			0
" people are looking for the modern day heroine			0
" and to dress like one , too .			0
