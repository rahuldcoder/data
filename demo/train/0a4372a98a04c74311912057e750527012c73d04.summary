-- the @entity1 finalized new federal standards on toxic pollutants and mercury emissions from coal power plants wednesday , a move being praised by environmentalists but criticized by others , who predict lost jobs and a strain on the nation 's power grid			1
@entity1 administrator @entity16 , at an event at the @entity14 in @entity15 , announced that for the first time @entity20 coal and oil - fired power plant operators must limit their emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants			1
" i am glad to be here to mark the finalization of a clean air rule that has been 20 years in the making , and is now ready to start improving our health , protecting our children , and cleaning up our air , " @entity24 said			1
" under the @entity34 these standards will require @entity20 power plants to put in place proven and widely available pollution control technologies to cut harmful emissions of mercury , arsenic , chromium , nickel and acid gases			2
in and of itself , this is a great victory for public health , especially for the health of our children			0
" @entity1 rules in place since the 1990s target acid rain and smog - forming chemicals emitting from power plants , but not mercury , a neurotoxin known to damage developing fetuses and children			1
@entity58 panel examining how chemicals in daily life affect kids ' health despite federal limits on emissions of mercury from other sources , such as waste incinerators , there have been no limits on coal - fired power plants , which the @entity1 says constitute the single largest source of mercury emissions			1
" these standards rank among the three or four most significant environmental achievements in the @entity1 's history , " said @entity73 , clean air director of the @entity74			1
" this rule making represents a generational achievement			2
" the new regulations are among the most wide - reaching to come from the @entity1 during @entity82 's administration			2
they include separate limits for mercury emissions , acid gasses , and other pollutants from several metals			2
opinion : we must stop allowing mercury pollution specifically , the @entity1 will impose numerical emission limits for all existing and future coal plants and propose a range of " widely available , technical and economically reasonable practices , technologies , and compliance strategies , " to meet the new demands			1
according to an @entity1 analysis , the larger economic benefits of the reduced pollution will more than pay for the short - term clean - up costs			1
the @entity1 also predicts more jobs will be created than lost as power plants invest million of dollars in upgrades			1
it also estimates the new regulations , by reducing people 's exposure to these toxins , will prevent 11,000 premature deaths each year and trim health costs			0
" @entity1 estimates that for every dollar spent to reduce pollution from power plants , the @entity20 public will see up to $ 9 in health benefits			1
the total health and economic benefits of this standard are estimated to be as much as $ 90 billion annually , " the agency said in a news release			0
but the @entity1 also acknowledges the regulations will result in increased power grid strain : by its estimate , 14.7 gigawatts of power supply will be eliminated from the @entity20 power grid when the rules take effect by 2015			2
that figure -- enough to power well over 10 million @entity20 households -- is overly optimistic , according to other industry analyses			0
several industry groups and some republicans also disagree about the economic impact the new regulations will have			0
@entity140 and @entity141 , chairmen of the @entity137 and subcommittee on regulatory affairs , respectively , sent a letter to the @entity143 earlier this week claiming the " @entity1 has failed to perform a proper analysis of the rule 's impact on job creation " and " consider the rule 's impact on grid reliability			1
" the new rules have also made their way to the @entity133 presidential campaign trail , with @entity154 recently predicting increased brownouts during the summer and @entity156 declaring the @entity1 is a " job - killing " agency			1
and the @entity20 @entity158 , a group traditionally sympathetic to @entity133 , has aired ads urging listeners not to " let the @entity1 turn out the lights on the @entity20 economy			1
" but the @entity82 administration has found an ally in @entity166 mayor @entity165 , who argued in a recent op - ed for the @entity168 that the new standards are gravely needed			0
" we can stop this , " @entity165 wrote of mercury poisoning			0
" we can spare children this tragic injustice and the pain it brings their families			0
we can spare adults from losing years off their lives			0
and we can spare taxpayers the enormous health care costs that come with mercury - related - illnesses			0
" environmentalists , who earlier his fall were outraged with @entity82 over his refusal to push for ozone emission standards the @entity1 supported , are also strongly on board			2
" this bold new announcement means less contaminated fish -- and more protections for kids who are at risk of developing learning disabilities and other problems that have been linked to mercury poisoning , " the @entity191 said in an e-mail to @entity0			0
" this is a big public health victory , 20 years in the making			1
it 's one of the most important anti-pollution measures in recent memory			0
" @entity204 , director of the @entity205 , said , " as a mom , i 'm especially excited to know that millions of mothers and babies will now be protected from mercury poisoning			0
we all teach our kids the simple rule that if you make a mess you should clean it up -- and now polluters will have to follow that same rule			2
" the new rule requires that the vast majority of mercury contained in coal be captured and prevented from releasing into the air when burned for energy , and would require operators to shut down or upgrade the least efficient power plants			1
power plant operators have three years to comply with the new standards , but plant operators may be granted additional time to install the necessary emissions improvement technologies if they are able to demonstrated a valid need			0
once airborne , mercury enters bodies of water through precipitation , becomes methylmercury , and accumulates in the food chain			0
the @entity1 and the @entity237 jointly recommend that pregnant women and young children limit their consumption of fish and shellfish to two meals a week because of the methylmercury contamination			2
@entity0 's @entity245 contributed to this report .			0

this is " a clean air rule that has been 20 years in the making , " @entity1 chief @entity24 says
the rules set numerical emission limits for all existing and future coal plants
some @entity133 say the rules will kill jobs
the @entity1 says an analysis shows more jobs will be created than lost
