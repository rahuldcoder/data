@entity0 -- when @entity3 spotted a dark shape last summer in the waters off @entity0 , where he was diving for fish , he initially thought it was a corpse			1
" i was afraid , " he told @entity1			0
" i put on my goggles , dove underneath and still could n't tell what it was			0
i resurfaced and got some help from other people and family members and came back , and after full four hours of trying we managed to get it out of the water and i was shocked by what i found			0
" it was a life - size bronze statue , believed to be a 2,500 - year - old depiction of the ancient @entity22 god @entity23			2
he described the half - ton object as " treasure pulled out of the sea			1
" " i thought it was made of gold ; i was going to be rich , " @entity3 said			1
" so i took it home to hide it			0
" but then others got involved			0
a local armed brigade took control of the statue , and someone listed it for sale on the online auction site @entity39 , with a starting price of about $ 500,000 , according to authorities			1
the posting raised suspicions among officials in the @entity45 and antiquities and the @entity47 in @entity0 , which is governed by the @entity50 @entity49 group @entity48			1
the antiquities authority and the @entity47 opened an investigation into what they said they suspected was an illegal attempt to sell the work of art. " it is against the law to sell an artifact found in the @entity50 territories and @entity0 in an illegal manner , " @entity59 , head of the antiquities department at the @entity45 and antiquities in @entity0 , told @entity1			1
he said the case was being handled by the @entity47 , while the antiquities authority looks after the statue			2
authorities there asked that the statue , as a historical artifact found in @entity0 , be handed over ; they have hidden it from public view			1
but in a @entity0 gold store , a man who displayed video of the statue told @entity1 that he has custody of it and that it is in safe hands , but -- if someone wants to buy it -- that would be possible			1
government officials promise that the statue will not be sold and that they will start restoration and display it after an investigation into its discovery is completed			2
" we are not denying that the statue was found in the sea -- as a matter of fact , that is a very authentic and real story , " @entity59 said			2
a green spot -- a sign of decay -- has formed on the leg of the statue , which is exposed to the air			0
" we are trying to preserve the statue to show it for the public in the near future			0
" he said the antiquities authority was working on a plan for the statue to be displayed in world - class museums around the world			0
museum authorities in @entity112 , @entity113 , have offered to help repair and preserve the statue , and plan for its eventual display in @entity0 , he said			1
for @entity3 and his family , the discovery seems unlikely to land them the financial security they had hoped for with a sale			2
they are instead hoping to net a reward for the find , which has excited archaeologists around the world			0
@entity1 's @entity128 in @entity129 and @entity130 in @entity131 contributed to this report .			0
