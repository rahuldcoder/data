-- @entity1 took a big step toward reaching the second round of the @entity4 with a 2 - 0 home win over @entity7 rivals @entity6 on tuesday night , while @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 also maintained their perfect start to @entity13 's premier club competition			1
@entity1 were beaten at home by the @entity16 side in the group stage last season , but the @entity20 league leaders are now a different proposition under new coach @entity22 , who led @entity23 to final glory in may			2
the game was virtually over after only 14 minutes as @entity26 and @entity27 scored within 60 seconds of each other			0
@entity26 followed up his weekend double against @entity29 with a free - kick that went straight through the middle of a poor defensive wall , leaving unsighted goalkeeper @entity33 with no chance			0
it was his fifth goal in three matches			0
the world 's most expensive player then broke down the left and passed inside to @entity40 midfielder @entity27 , whose shot took a wicked deflection off @entity43 and looped over @entity33 into the net			0
@entity6 went close to pulling a goal back in the 29th minute , but keeper @entity46 did well to tip @entity48 's fierce free - kick onto the crossbar			1
@entity1 could not translate their attacking dominance into more goals , and in the 83rd minute needed captain @entity46 to stop former @entity1 forward @entity52 from setting up a tense finale after coming on to replace @entity54			2
@entity56 side @entity55 moved level with @entity6 on six points after beating @entity59 2 - 1 at home in a match which saw three players sent off in the second half			1
@entity65 midfielder @entity64 fired the four - time champions ahead in the seventh minute and @entity68 striker @entity67 made it 2 - 0 four minutes before halftime			1

however , @entity59 's hopes of earning a first point -- and perhaps a place in the @entity79 -- faded when @entity72 received his second yellow card for handball			0
substitute @entity82 did not even get on the field as he was ordered from the bench for dissent			0
@entity87 champions @entity9 needed two - own goals from @entity90 's @entity89 in order to come from behind and seal a 3 - 2 home victory in @entity93 @entity94 headed the visitors in front in the 28th minute , but the @entity98 defender deflected a shot by @entity100 into his own net four minutes later and teammate @entity102 did the same from @entity105 's effort on 37			1
@entity40 striker @entity106 made it 3 - 1 from close range with 13 minutes to play for a @entity9 side missing several key players before @entity111 midfielder @entity110 scored a late consolation for @entity89 , who suffered a second defeat			1
@entity116 side @entity115 made it three teams on three points with a 3 - 1 victory away to previously second - placed @entity120			1
@entity121 put the visitors ahead in the 12th minute after being set up by a header from strike partner @entity124 , but @entity126 forward @entity125 leveled nine minutes later from @entity128 's first - time throughball			2
@entity130 fullback @entity129 restored @entity115 's lead just before the break with a fierce shot , while @entity120 's @entity134 hit the post after the interval before substitute @entity137 sealed victory in injury - time			2
@entity8 clinched a third successive victory in @entity140 with a 2 - 0 victory away to previously unbeaten @entity142 in tuesday 's opening match			1
@entity145 international @entity144 chose the perfect time to score his first goal for the @entity149 champions , lashing home a left - foot volley in the 24th minute after the home defense failed to properly clear a long ball forward			0
@entity154 doubled the lead just before halftime after @entity157 won the ball in midfield and set him free , with the former @entity160 striker making up for wasting a similar earlier opportunity			0
@entity163 side @entity162 kept alive hopes of reaching the second round , beating @entity167 's @entity166 to register their first points			1
@entity170 defender @entity169 headed the only goal four minutes after halftime for the 1993 champions			0
@entity174 after crushing main rivals @entity175 5 - 1 at home , with captain @entity177 marking his return from injury with a second - half penalty			1
@entity181 and @entity182 netted in the first half before @entity186 midfielder @entity184 struck from the penalty spot on the hour mark			0
@entity190 midfielder @entity189 and striker @entity191 made it three goals in less than 10 minutes before @entity195 striker @entity194 came off the bench to score against his former club in the 82nd minute			0
@entity199 's @entity198 won the battle of the group 's two pointless teams , winning 2 - 0 at home to @entity204			1
