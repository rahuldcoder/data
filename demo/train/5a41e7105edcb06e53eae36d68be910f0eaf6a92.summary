there was no shortage of wind or electricity at thursday night 's debate between vice president @entity5 and rep. @entity6 , the @entity7 contender for that office			1
but federal support for wind power and electric cars was one of the early flashpoints between the two			1
" was it a good idea to spend taxpayer dollars on electric cars in @entity17 or windmills in @entity19 ? " @entity6 asked @entity5 as he defended the @entity22 administration 's economic stimulus measures			1
" was it a good idea to borrow this money from @entity19 and spend it on these interest groups ? " @entity6 was criticizing the support for wind energy in the stimulus bill and to an @entity31 loan to electric automaker @entity32			1
it 's not a new line of attack for the @entity7 or for @entity6 's running mate , @entity36			1
both have been controversial and closely examined			0
fact check : @entity6 cites unlikely outcome under @entity40 the facts : the @entity31 agreed to lend @entity32 nearly $ 530 million in 2009 to build two electric cars , the @entity43 and @entity44 , later dubbed the @entity45			1
the plug - in hybrid karma is being assembled in @entity17 , while the @entity45 -- which has yet to go into production -- was to be built at a former @entity49 plant in @entity50			2
@entity32 drew $ 193 million of the loan before may 2011 , when it was cut off for failing to meet the @entity43 's production milestones			0
all of that money went to engineering and design costs , the @entity31 says			0
@entity32 said " not a single dollar " was spent outside the @entity56			2
and while @entity6 was attacking @entity5 over the @entity22 administration 's 2009 stimulus bill , the loan actually came from an advanced auto technology program passed in 2007 , before @entity22 took office			1
meanwhile , administration efforts to promote the expansion of renewable energy , particularly solar and wind , have drawn fire from @entity7 and some @entity68 , such as @entity70 sen. @entity69			2
wind energy received about $ 9 billion in the stimulus bill , and @entity69 complained to energy secretary @entity73 in 2009 that a major project in @entity75 was being built with @entity19 wind turbines			1
industry analysts note that there were few @entity56 firms in the business at the time			0
of the top 10 turbine manufacturers in 2008 , only one -- @entity83 -- was a @entity56 - based company , according to a 2011 @entity85 report			0
the rest were in @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity19			0
@entity89 , an investigative journalist who documented the role of overseas corporations in the federal energy programs in 2010 , said the plan was to start building equipment in the @entity56 , and that has worked to some extent			2
" the market needs the turbines from somewhere , so they had to go overseas with hopes that it would spur activity here , " he told @entity97 in july			0
fact check : @entity104 and the bomb the industry says generating capacity has doubled since 2008 , and the @entity108 in @entity109 says that 's created between 52,000 and 75,000 jobs			0
and while @entity19 's wind industry has grown rapidly with the aid of government support , it has n't been a major player in the @entity56 market			2
in 2010 , nearly 60 % of @entity56 imports came from @entity119 , the home of no. 1 turbine manufacturer @entity120 ; @entity19 and other @entity123 countries " accounted for very small shares of @entity56 imports , the @entity85 found			0
conclusion : yes , the @entity43 is being built in @entity17 -- but the government 's support for @entity32 was approved under a program signed by then - president @entity127 , not through stimulus funds			1
and while international manufacturers did get a piece of @entity56 wind projects that were supported by the stimulus bill , that 's largely because @entity56 companies were n't among the big players			1
