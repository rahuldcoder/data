for all the talk of a possible cease - fire , residents of @entity1 and @entity2 in @entity3 are living under a daily barrage of attacks			1
more than 1,200 @entity2 have been killed , as have 53 @entity1 soldiers and three civilians in @entity1			1
@entity1 said it has wiped out the majority of @entity12 ' rocket supply , but the fighting shows no sign of abating			1
" if the enemy has not had enough of our strikes , our fighters have a lot to surprise the enemy 's leaders and its special forces , " @entity12 said tuesday in an online posting			1
@entity1 prime minister @entity24 told his country monday to prepare for " a protracted campaign			2
" " our goal is clear , " @entity1 government spokesman @entity27 told @entity28 on tuesday			2
" our goal is to free the people of @entity1 from the terror of these rocket attacks coming from @entity3 and from these tunnel attacks coming from @entity3 where people pop out of the ground with machine guns and explosives to kill and to murder , to kidnap people			2
" the goal " can be achieved diplomatically or militarily or a combination of them both , " he added			0
" but we will continue until that goal is achieved			0
" just what it would take to stop @entity12 militarily -- and whether that 's even possible -- remains unclear			1
some key numbers : 32 -- the number of tunnels @entity1 uncovered in @entity3 as of monday			2
@entity1 does not know how many more it may find			2
" there are still chances that there are tunnels that we have no knowledge about that are already inside @entity1 , " @entity52 spokesman @entity51 told @entity28 tuesday			2
" we 're operating in order to locate them			0
" each tunnel costs $ 3 million , according to the @entity1 military			1
and for all the destruction wrought on @entity3 , militants could still build more in the future			0
@entity12 is the controlling government in @entity3			2
@entity28 's @entity66 goes into a @entity12 tunnel 10,000 - the number of rockets @entity1 estimated @entity12 to have in its arsenal when the hostilities began			1
militants have launched more than 2,600 , according to the @entity52			0
and the @entity52 has struck more than 3,000 , @entity52 spokesman lt. col. @entity51 told @entity28 on tuesday			0
" so our assessment is they 're depleted around 60 % of their capabilities , " @entity51 said			1
but given that @entity1 has found more tunnels than it expected , it 's possible militants have more rockets than @entity1 realized , as well			1
and while many are smuggled in from @entity85 and @entity86 , many others are homemade , notes @entity87 of the @entity88			0
" you can always find , from the rubble , pipes that can be cut			0
and you can always scrounge ingredients to make propellant , " he says			0
these rockets might be less effective , but militants will always " be able to reconstitute their rocket force in some way , " he says			0
" so you never get to the point where you slap your hands and say , ' @entity101 accomplished			0
' " bombing workshops where many rockets are made might prevent militants from producing longer - range rockets that threaten people beyond southern @entity1			1
but " you 'll never be able to bomb them to the point that they ca n't produce " the cruder rockets , @entity87 said			0
in its online posting tuesday , @entity12 said it " still retains its full power and force			2
" more than 300 -- the number of militants @entity1 says it has killed so far in the conflict			2
the @entity122 says there are " several thousand " @entity3 - based @entity12 militant operatives along with a " reported 9,000 - person @entity12 - led paramilitary group known as the ' @entity126			0
' " @entity1 , meanwhile , has 176,000 active military personnel , has called up some reservists and can tap into a pool of hundreds of thousands more if needed			1
@entity12 leaders appear " confident that the group could sustain its attacks until it secures its key demand : ending the blockade of the @entity3 by @entity135 and @entity1 , " says @entity136 , @entity137 editor of @entity138			1
$ 62,000 -- the cost of each missile used by @entity1 's @entity142 defense system to block militants ' rockets from hitting @entity1			1
more than 500 have been used , making the total more than $ 31 million			0
" we 're confident we can continue to operate with that , " @entity51 told @entity28 's @entity66			0
each battery used by the @entity142 system costs $ 50 million , @entity146 's said			0
" despite the improvements in @entity142 's performance in recent months , it 's clear @entity1 is on the wrong side of the cost curve , " says @entity149 , senior political scientist at @entity150			1
" the reality is that building sophisticated missile defense systems like @entity142 remains much more expensive than acquiring missiles themselves			1
" how @entity142 blocks rockets from @entity3 , protects @entity1 1.8 million and 8 million - ultimately , the most important figures may be the populations of @entity3 and @entity1 , respectively , and how they respond to the devastating casualties and destruction			1
the majority of @entity1 currently support military action against @entity12 , the @entity164 reported			1
it 's unclear how many in @entity3 want militants to stop rocket attacks			0
last month , a poll by the @entity88 found most @entity2 in @entity3 oppose a two - state solution and want to work toward a five - year goal of abolishing @entity1 -- but the majority said they support nonviolent methods of " popular resistance			0

@entity12 vows it has " a lot to surprise the enemy "
@entity1 vows to stop threats " diplomatically or military "
@entity1 *believes* about 60 % of @entity12 ' rockets depleted
more than 500 @entity142 missiles have been used
