-- a slender and stylish woman with a full dark beard -- yes , a beard -- stands in the middle of the roiling battle between @entity6 and the @entity7 , adding to the fury of a growing confrontation			1
who could have imagined it ? i 'm talking about the singer @entity13 , alter ego of the @entity15 artist @entity13			1
@entity13 just won the hugely popular eurovision contest with overwhelming public support , turning herself into an instant international superstar , a fact that is apparently driving many influential @entity6 into a foot - stomping rage			1
in theory , @entity21 , the venerable 58 - year - old @entity23 tradition , is all about good feelings and understanding between neighbors in a continent once torn by war			2
in reality , it is a competition driven by crisscrossing rivalries and subtle political overtones			0
this year the competition was something to behold			0
more than 100 million viewers across dozens of countries tuned in on saturday night			0
when @entity15 's turn came , the camera slowly zoomed in on the stylish figure in the golden dress standing in the middle of the giant stage			2
the camera moved in to reveal a thick , well - trimmed beard on the face of a woman with long black hair			1
@entity13 sang " @entity47 , " a theme evoking personal rebirth , transformation , and triumph			1
we might have been able to hear the gasps of surprise that surely rose across @entity23 living rooms			0
we could not record those			0
but the competition did register the public reaction , and we know millions cheered , because @entity13 won the competition			1
and yet , not everyone found the performance all that inspiring			0
@entity6 president @entity62 has in recent years redefined @entity6 as a rival , an opponent of the @entity7			1
and among the aspects of " western culture " that he has used to distinguish @entity6 from its rivals is its attitude toward equality for gays			1
@entity62 has quite deliberately become the standard - bearer of traditional morality , cracking down mercilessly on @entity6 liberals , particularly on its gay and lesbian citizens , even foreign visitors , as part of an effort to stoke popular support in a country that , despite having lived through the cutting - edge social experiment of communism , remains deeply conservative			1
the ongoing battle over @entity86 , which stands on the edge of civil war , was triggered by a push by @entity86 to strengthen its ties to the @entity91 , something @entity62 is loath to accept			1
the dispute with @entity86 created tensions at the @entity21 contest			0
since the voting includes phone and text , organizers had to decide what to do with the vote from @entity102 , the province that @entity6 seized from @entity86 a few weeks ago			2
( they counted those votes as @entity86			0
) but it was @entity13 , " the bearded lady , " who stuck like a stone inside the @entity109 ' shoes			2
@entity6 , along with people in @entity111 and @entity112 , filed petitions to remove @entity13 from the competition , or at least edit her out of the broadcast			1
@entity13 did n't just sing			2
and when the time came to vote , they texted and phoned in with abandon			0
she won the competition by a wide margin			0
who knows what exactly drove the vote ? she sang well			0
but undoubtedly there were other factors at play			0
in the press conference after her victory , somebody asked her if she had a message for @entity62			1
but in @entity6 , life for people whose sexual orientation is out of the mainstream is rife with danger			2
a year ago , @entity62 signed a law banning gay " propaganda , " which makes it illegal to even express support for gay rights in any manner			2
gay parents worry about losing their children			0
many are leaving the country			0
it 's the tip of the iceberg of @entity62 's repression of the opposition			1
@entity13 would face harassment in @entity6			1
she uses the pronoun " she " to refer to herself , and her sexual identity can make your head spin : she is the creation of @entity13 , who uses the pronoun " he " and describes it as having " two hearts beating in my chest			2
" he created @entity13 , complete with a fictional birthplace -- the mountains of @entity165 -- to deal with the discrimination of his teenage years , when he liked to dress in girls ' clothes			2
@entity13 demolishes our conception of femininity and masculinity			2
she is an individual creation ; @entity175 's creation come to life			0
but do n't expect @entity6 politicians to have any understanding			2
the always outrageous ultranationalist member of parliament , @entity179 , declared that @entity13 's win marks " the end of @entity23			1
" he helpfully offered that " fifty years ago , the @entity184 occupied @entity15 ... we should have stayed there			0
" of course , @entity179 is not the man on whose judgment we should rely for issues of morality			0
a few weeks ago , he was confronted on live television by a @entity6 journalist , a pregnant woman , on the subject of @entity86			1
he accused her of having " a uterine frenzy " and ordered one of his aides to " rape her violently			0
" @entity62 's deputy prime minister , @entity201 , used the @entity203 victory to take a slap at @entity86 , sarcastically tweeting , " @entity21 showed the eurointegrators their europerspective -- a bearded girl			1
" that was something of a limp slap			0
a member of the @entity210 legislative assembly officially asked @entity6 's @entity21 committee to stop participating in the competition , thus to avoid having @entity6 performers on the same stage as " the clear transvestite and hermaphrodite @entity13 , " which would serve as propaganda for " moral decay			1
" the despicable @entity179 -- whom i had the inerasable experience of meeting in @entity222 , @entity223 , many years ago ( he was wearing revealing @entity224 doing laps in the hotel pool ) -- said : " there are no more men or women in @entity23			0
" he might have thought the quip very clever			0
in reality , @entity13 showed us that there are many kinds of people in @entity23 -- including in @entity6			1
and the people who voted for the new @entity21 champion showed they are very consciously throwing their support behind someone who represents openness , inclusiveness , and the possibility of becoming a human being that may not conform to the standards set by others			0
with that , @entity23 television viewers sent a message to @entity62 , and to @entity6 , and to all the people who would like to fight to keep the world from changing			1
and they put @entity13 , in her full - length evening gown , with her bearded face , right in the middle of that battlefield .			1

@entity13 , a " woman " with a full beard , overwhelmingly won eurovision song contest
@entity257 : she became a *lightning* rod in culture war between the @entity7 and @entity6
@entity6 , known for *anti-gay* laws , demanded that @entity13 be removed from the contest
@entity265 : when asked , @entity13 's message to president @entity62 was " we are unstoppable "
