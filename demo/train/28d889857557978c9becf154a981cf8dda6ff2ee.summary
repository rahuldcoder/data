@entity0 -- legally , president @entity2 can effectively fire @entity3 and have the federal government take over efforts to stop the @entity7 oil spill			1
the question is whether that would help the situation			0
no one argues that the @entity12 of 1990 gives @entity2 the authority to take over all efforts to plug the well gushing 5,000 feet beneath the surface			1
however , officials of oil giant @entity3 , while acknowledging their failure so far to stop the leak , say no one -- not even the @entity22 government -- can match their company 's know - how and technology in such a crisis			1
" i do n't think anyone else could do better than we are , " @entity26 , the @entity3 chief operating officer , said monday			1
" i know that that 's frustrating to hear and our performance , to this point , i wish was better			2
i wish this was done			0
but we 're doing everything we can			0
and i do n't actually believe anyone could do any better , unfortunately			0
" administration officials also have said they lack the technology -- such as unmanned submarines that can work at such ocean depths -- that has been deployed by @entity3			1
interior secretary @entity39 , who previously threatened a government takeover of the mission , made clear monday that @entity3 must be involved in trying to stop the leaking oil			1
" there are areas where @entity3 and the private sector are the ones who must continue to lead the efforts with government oversight , such as a deployment of private sector technology 5,000 feet below the ocean surface to kill the well , " @entity39 said monday			1
" @entity3 and the private sector , with the help of federal scientists , are the ones who must get that problem solved and we have the oversight capacity in the administration to make sure that they are doing that			2
" in addition , the administration 's point man on the spill response , coast guard commandant @entity65 , said monday that @entity3 's strategies were endorsed by other top oil company executives and he would advise against any shift from @entity3 's continued involvement			1
" they have the means of production , " @entity65 said at a @entity74 news conference			0
" they have the logistics in place			0
they have the @entity81 [ remotely operated vehicles ] that are down there			0
we are jointly operating in their command post out of @entity88 [ @entity89 ]			0
everybody that has a stake in the fight is there			0
and i am satisfied with the coordination that 's going on			2
" while the military has some deep - sea capability , such as deep - sea submersibles , a senior @entity98 official said the military has no unique technology to offer regarding offshore oil drilling			1
the military has undersea imagery technology , but military officials said it would not add any capability to what the private industry is already using			2
@entity111 , managing director for oil and gas research at the @entity114 investment bank and firm , said the government has the authority , " but we do n't have the technology or ability to do it			1
" " the government is not in the oil business , " @entity111 said , adding that @entity3 is the industry leader , and " if they can not do it , nobody else can			1
" @entity39 said sunday that the federal role in stopping the leak is overseeing @entity3 's efforts rather than taking over			1
at the same time , he said the government could exert its full authority with regard to dealing with the spilled oil once the leak is stopped			2
" with respect to the rest of the responses , including keeping the oil from coming near shore and onshore and dealing with those ecological values , @entity3 , again , is the responsible party and is on the hook for doing everything that needs to happen , " @entity39 said sunday			1
" if we find that they 're not doing what they 're supposed to be doing , we 'll push them out of the way appropriately and we 'll move forward to make sure that everything is being done to protect the people of the @entity148 , the ecological values of the @entity148 , and the values of the @entity22 people			0
" since the april 20 explosion and fire destroyed the @entity155 offshore rig , setting off the deep - sea gusher , oil giant @entity3 has led the effort to stop the leak			1
several failed efforts in the ensuing month have raised frustration across the nation as the spilled oil spreads , coating some @entity164 coastlines and threatening areas to the @entity166 and perhaps beyond			2
@entity2 is coming under increasing criticism for the inability to stop it , causing his chief spokesman to mount an impassioned defense of administration efforts			2
" first and foremost , we are trying to do everything , as i 've said , humanly and technologically possible , first to plug this leak and , secondly , to deal with what has spilled , " @entity172 told reporters monday			0
even @entity2 's critics seem to recognize there are limits to what the government can accomplish			0
" they can fire @entity3 and take it over , " @entity184 sen. @entity183 of @entity185 said sunday on the @entity187 program " @entity188			2
" " but the truth is , the federal government probably does n't have the capacity to do that			0
" @entity193 , the @entity194 director who is assisting in the @entity7 oil spill response , said sunday that initial unrealistic expectations about the possibility of stopping the leak may be heightening the frustration now			1
" i think everyone has to understand that the kinds of operations they are doing in the deep sea have never been done before , " @entity193 said			0
" and i think it is too bad that expectations were probably raised on schedules that probably were impossible to meet in terms of the kinds of construction that was required in the deep sea to effect these operations ; that involved mobilizing equipment , fabricating new devices that had never been deployed at these depths before			0
" @entity1 's @entity216 contributed to this report .			0

@entity12 gives president authority to take over efforts to stop oil gusher
@entity3 officials insist that no one could match the company 's know - how and technology
@entity114 *analyst* : if @entity3 " can not do it , nobody else can . period "
initial expectations were unrealistic , @entity194 director says
