-- on monday , three lucky diners nibbled a $ 325,000 burger -- not in the name of luxury but in the name of science , animal rights and sustainability			1
the meat was grown in a lab. this in - vitro hamburger is " cultured " in many different ways : it 's the product of human ingenuity , it 's considerate of humans , animals and the planet , and it 's produced through growing cells			1
tasters declared the hamburger a little dry , and you wo n't be able to buy one any time soon			2
but that 's not the point : it 's a proof of concept prototype -- evidence that it is physically possible to produce meat through cell culture			1
it 's a step toward a day when meat can be produced in a cost - effective , time - efficient and completely animal - free manner			1
by collecting cells from healthy animals and culturing them in a sterile environment , we can grow animal muscle and bypass slaughter and inhumane treatment			1
we can establish a safer food supply by avoiding conditions that promote the spread of disease			0
and we can take a major step toward improving our impact on the environment , including a dramatic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions			2
but perhaps the most radical aspect of cultured meat is that its development has been nearly entirely philanthropic , funded largely by individual donors and foundations			1
the funding behind the creation of this cultured hamburger did not come from a private company or a government but from the forward - thinking co-founder of @entity57 , @entity58			1
he donated dollars to seek a novel and transformative solution to the world 's meat problem			1
this hamburger was developed by @entity64 , a @entity65 researcher at the @entity66			2
the nonprofit organization @entity67 also has been instrumental in advancing cultured meat			1
by funding scientific research directly , using donations from individuals and advising both the @entity65 government and @entity58 's foundation to support cultured meat research , @entity67 has been a key player in keeping development of this new technology cooperative and a concerted worldwide effort			1
all of this research remains in the public domain			0
the implications of it being available to all are very promising			0
at first glance , cultured meat might seem to be a homogenizing of our food choices			1
but beer is a biotech product with many tastes and types			0
how it is produced is public information			0
and that makes the business of beer vastly different from the business of , say , transgenic crops			0
the production of beer requires living organisms -- yeast -- and nourishment for those organisms -- grain			0
how these elements come together with others to make beer is straightforward in theory , and nuanced in practice			2
the products are varied and distinct			0
cultured meat production is extremely similar			1
explained simply , all that is required is a cell line and nourishment for those cells			2
how the cells are grown , and under what conditions , are adjustable			0
the potential variety of materials and processes will allow cultured meat to take on many distinctly unique forms , flavors and textures			1
any intellectual property protection in beer production is negligible			0
nothing holds back the home brewer or the craft brewer from creating one - of - a - kind offerings			0
perhaps it is the lack of clear intellectual property protection opportunities for cultured meat that has kept @entity134 companies at arm 's length to date			1
to extend the analogy further , consider the visuals of brewing : stainless steel bioreactors containing living organisms and biological reactions , and controlled aseptic environments			0
not only do we tour these facilities as a casual weekend activity , we are also pleased to eat or drink in their presence at a microbrewery or brew pub. imagine that within those stainless steel walls , meat was brewing			2
contrast this with the facilities that produce meat today , and you can appreciate just how much cultured meat is a concept that can shake up current systems			1
as @entity161 said , we ca n't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them			0
it 's a new way of thinking because this is food science by the public , for the public			2
it prompts a widespread conversation about a food technology years in advance of its market release rather than years afterward			2
it 's a new way of thinking because it 's a technology largely driven by societal demand and people have pushed this forward , as donors to a cause			2
the biggest reasons why cultured meat has n't progressed further is a lack of funding and a lack of creative understanding			1
we 're not used to food technology being a positive solution			0
we 're not used to food development being nonprofit			0
and we 're not used to a nonprofit group generally categorized as an animal rights / environmentalist group requiring a cancer research - scale budget			2
some people might think the meat has a " yuck " factor			0
we should all get over it			0
we 've embraced all kinds of technologies that first seemed like science fiction -- think in - vitro fertilization and @entity204			0
the yuck factor associated with modern - day factory farming is undeniable			0
and meat seems to be recalled for bacterial contamination every other month , and we still buy it			0
in many ways the hamburger as we know it is a symbol of the meat problem : the globalization of food , overconsumption , illogical food pricing and fast - food culture			1
the cultured hamburger symbolizes something else : our opportunity to take back food technology			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			1

a hamburger that cost $ 325,000 to create in a lab was served this week
@entity227 : it 's not ready for market but proves we can make meat through cell culture
@entity238 : cultured meat is good for the environment , safe , and it eliminates animal slaughter
@entity238 : it 's not funded by companies or government but by individuals and foundations
