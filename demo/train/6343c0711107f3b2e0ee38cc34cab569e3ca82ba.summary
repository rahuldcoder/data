@entity0 -- less than two months before voters are expected to go to the polls in national elections , @entity3 prime minister @entity2 wednesday announced ambitious plans to dig a new canal through @entity0 that would bypass the existing @entity9			1
" today we are rolling up our sleeves for one of the biggest projects of the century , which will outshine the @entity17 and @entity16 , " @entity2 said at a party conference			2
the proposed @entity18 would run for more than 45 kilometers , or about 28 miles , from the @entity19 through @entity3 's largest city and commercial capital , to the @entity22 -- roughly parallel to the @entity9 , the natural body of water that already bisects @entity0			1
the @entity25 is 77 kilometers ( roughly 48 miles ) in length , while the @entity27 in @entity28 is more than 190 kilometers ( 118 miles ) long			0
@entity2 said one of the goals of the proposed canal would be to reduce the huge amount of international cargo ships that regularly traverse the congested @entity9			1
" one of the most important reasons for this project will be to reduce @entity9 traffic and minimize threats , " @entity2 said , in comments published on the prime minister 's official web - site			1
more than a 100 ships a day sail up and down the @entity9			0
many of them carry dangerous cargos of crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas ( @entity48 )			0
the fast currents and narrow bends in the historic channel have led to several accidents on the banks of @entity3 's most populous city			0
the deadliest incident took place in 1979 , when a @entity58 oil tanker exploded after colliding with another vessel , killing dozens of people and leaking tons of oil into the sea			0
in his speech wednesday , @entity2 conceded that critics in the @entity3 media had referred to his plan as a " crazy project			2
" " with this project , there will be two seas running through @entity0 , " he said , adding that the canal would result in the creation of a man - made island and another peninsula			0
the prime minister said the proposed canal would be 145 meters ( 475 feet ) wide and 25 meters ( 82 feet ) deep			1
but he stopped short of announcing the exact route of the proposed waterway			1
the location and financing of the project would be kept secret , @entity2 said , to " prevent any negativity and unfairness and injustice			2

the proposed canal will be 45 kilometers long , the prime minister says
@entity2 would *n't* reveal the exact route
he says the project will rival the @entity17 and @entity92 canals
