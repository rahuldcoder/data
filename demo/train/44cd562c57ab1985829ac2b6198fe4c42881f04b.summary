@entity0 -- the 40th anniversary of the normalization of relations between @entity5 and @entity6 will be marked on september 29 but there seems little to celebrate			1
the territorial dispute between @entity6 and @entity5 over the rocky outcrops , known as the senkakus in @entity6 and @entity11 in @entity5 , has escalated beyond expectations as both governments have upped the ante and domestic politics constrains room for maneuver			1
as bad as it seems now , it was also quite perilous in 2010 after a @entity6 @entity20 arrested the crew of a fishing trawler that rammed them in the waters near the disputed rocks			2
this arrest sparked widespread angry protests and attacks on @entity6 businesses in @entity5			1
fresh @entity31 protests in @entity5 on symbolic anniversary after @entity33 withheld exports of rare earth metals vital to @entity6 industry , @entity0 capitulated by releasing the crew and captain			1
this incident inflamed lingering resentments and stoked mutual suspicions			0
in this most recent standoff , the saber - rattling has grown more ominous against the backdrop of a political transition in @entity33 and leadership elections in @entity6 's two main parties			1
in this context , it is difficult for either side to dial down the rhetoric			0
contenders for party presidency in @entity6 are all taking a hardline , one that will fuel more tensions			2
background : how remote rock split @entity5 , @entity6 meanwhile , @entity33 is getting ready to pass the baton of leadership at a time when the economy is slowing and there is growing discontent with corruption , nepotism and income disparities			1
pundits expect @entity33 to clamp down on the demonstrations before they morph into anti-government protests			0
the temptation of patriotic blustering is hard for either side to resist , but in this dangerous game of brinksmanship both countries have a lot to lose			1
there is a serious risk of miscalculation on both sides that could cause this scrap to spiral out of control			0
it does n't take much to make a martyr and once there is blood in the water , stability in @entity88 is at risk			0
there is little to be gained from aggravating a dispute that has now assumed symbolic importance as a test of wills			2
@entity88 's disputed islands -- who claims what ? @entity0 - @entity33 relations are fragile and in this case the volatile combination of territorial disputes , competition for seabed resources , strategic ambitions , nationalism and unresolved historical grievances have elevated these remote outcrops into the focal point for longstanding grievances in @entity5 and growing anxieties in @entity6			1
the rapid rise of @entity5 has lead to a tectonic shift in @entity114 geopolitics and the decline of @entity6 influence			1
this abrupt and far - reaching shift in the balance of power is destabilizing because it challenges the status quo			0
complicating this transition is the acrimony caused by former prime minister @entity123 's ( 2001 - 06 ) six trips to @entity124 , seen as a talismanic ground zero for an unrepentant view of @entity6 's rampage in @entity88 between 1931 - 45			1
the rising tide of @entity5 nationalism finds a familiar and handy target in @entity6			1
at the same time , @entity6 conservatives do their nation no favors by repeated provocations with their @entity114 neighbors			2
governor @entity136 of @entity0 deserves most of the blame for the current fracas			0
in april he announced plans to purchase three of the disputed islands from their private owner in @entity6 and raised over $ 15 million from public donations to do so			1
@entity33 has been fuming ever since			0
an issue that had been simmering on the back burner since late 2010 is now boiling over and causing great damage to @entity6 's considerable interests in @entity5			1
this is @entity136 's own goal , driven by an ideological agenda and contempt , that is not in line with public attitudes			0
he also succeeded in forcing the central government to buy the islands , as the @entity156 government decided that it had to marginalize @entity136 in order to manage the situation and prevent him from doing further damage			2
but in doing so , @entity0 triggered the current altercation			0
@entity136 may also be chortling because he has managed to shift @entity6 politics to the right , as political contenders try to out do each other in hardline statements			1
he may be hoping to ratchet up nationalism in @entity6 because he believes the nation suffers from a patriotic deficit			2
the absence of @entity171 demonstrations in @entity6 suggest that he has not succeeded in this , but he has certainly inflicted great damage on bilateral relations and the scars will persist for some time			2
the media frenzy is whipping up negative mutual perceptions and a new generation in both countries is learning to hate and vilify			2
can the " hot " economic relationship remain insulated from political upheaval ? this is the billion - dollar question leaders should be asking because @entity6 is a leading investor and source of technology while @entity5 is its largest trading partner			1
the rocks in question are not worth all the damage they are causing , but that is precisely the point			0
this issue has become dangerously politicized where cost - benefit analysis , or resort to legal arguments , appear unpromising			0
can calmer heads prevail ? probably			0
both sides appear to be carefully edging away from the abyss , but a disastrous turn of events and violent clashes remain ominously possible			2
there has to be a cooling off period , but the political transition might be an opportunity to hit the reset button			1
to move forward @entity33 and @entity0 should commit to talks about the disputed territories without preconditions , agree to refrain from violence in pursuit of rival claims and move towards confidence building measures ( @entity216 ) that sidestep the issue of sovereignty			0
the most ambitious of these @entity219 would be joint development of @entity222 seabed resources as specified in a 2008 accord			1
in 1978 , @entity224 suggested that this dispute be put aside , placing faith in the wisdom of future generations to resolve this discord			0
hopefully leaders on both sides will find that wisdom and act on it to avert catastrophe			0
in the meantime , confidence - destroying measures are digging a deeper hole to climb out of			0
foin us on @entity240 / @entity239 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity243 .			0

relations between @entity5 and @entity6 remain tense amid *ongoing* islands dispute
@entity248 : this is a dangerous game of brinksmanship , both countries have a lot to lose
fueled by territorial disputes , seabed resources , strategic ambitions , nationalism
political transition in both countries might be an opportunity to hit the reset button
