-- more than 1 million cell phones in @entity2 have been struck by the " @entity4 " virus , according to @entity2 state media , cctv and @entity7			1
it 's called the " @entity4 " virus because it transmits from phone to phone , just as in the movies , zombie bites turn people into the living dead			0
the virus binds with a security application , which then transmits the user 's sim card details to a central server controlled by a small group of hackers			1
the hackers then will send messages or make phone calls that contain virus - ridden links for games and software , said cctv			1
receivers who follow the link will find their phones infected , too , while at the same time providing a " click through " for the link itself , which typically translates into a payment for a party publicizing the links			0
@entity6 said that the blame is likely to lay with intermediary distributors instead of the actual game or software developers that show up in the ads. @entity40 , an official with the @entity41 , told @entity6 that " in the first week of september , nearly 1 million cell phones in the country were infected with the virus			2
" and although telecom providers are said to have taken steps to reduce the number of infected messages , @entity45 , a telecom expert at the @entity46 , told @entity6 that an updated virus might start sending fewer messages , making it harder for cell users to notice any suspicious activity			0
@entity56 , the company behind the original infected security application , told @entity6 that is has nothing to do with the virus , adding that it 's difficult for users to tell which applications are infected and which are safe .			0
