-- " it 's a miracle , " she told me			2
" we can now have a baby that wo n't have @entity8 's disease			2
i thought i 'd never be able to have any kids -- because of the disease			2
" her father had died from this disorder , which results from a gene mutation			1
she feared that she might have the mutation , too			2
but she was too scared to undergo testing for it			1
she also worried that if she had it , she might pass it on to her children			2
this disease causes severe neurological and psychiatric problems , and eventual death at around the same age as one 's parent died of it -- usually in one 's 40s or 50s			2
if a parent has the disease , each child has a 50 % chance of inheriting it			2
@entity35 , the singer and songwriter , died of this illness			2
his children then had to debate whether they wanted to know if they , too , had the lethal mutation			0
his son , @entity41 , for instance , decided not to find out			0
many such offspring feel that to undergo this genetic test is to risk " getting a death sentence , " i.e. , while they may feel fine , they know they have a mutation that will kill them			0
the woman with whom i spoke was afraid to learn if she had this gene			1
but she wanted to make sure that her children did not get it			0
luckily , a relatively new procedure -- pre-implantation genetic diagnosis , or @entity56 -- allows doctors to test embryos before they are implanted into a woman 's womb , to help ensure that certain gene mutations are not passed on			1
using in @entity63 , sperm fertilize eggs outside the womb , creating embryos			1
when the embryos are a few days old , one cell is removed and can be tested for hundreds of genes			1
this woman struggled with what to do			0
she feared she would be playing @entity72			0
but she decided to undergo the procedure			0
the doctor told her that embryos without the mutation were implanted inside her			1
he did not tell her whether he had identified any embryos with the mutation			1
thus , she was able to have a child free of the gene mutation that would cause @entity8 's disease , tremendously relieving her and her husband of worries			1
she still does not know if she has the bad gene herself			1
but this procedure is raising myriad complex ethical and social issues			1
it can eliminate gene mutations for untreatable diseases that kill infants and adults			1
but it can also be used to select embryos based on other genetic factors			1
many parents decide that they want to choose , for instance , their future child 's gender , and many doctors now use this technology to do so			1
at some point in the future , tests will no doubt be marketed for genes that , companies will claim , are associated with behavioral traits such as intelligence , sexual orientation , possibly even perfect musical pitch , or physical characteristics like height , blond hair and blue eyes			0
many of these claims will be highly questionable			0
among diseases , @entity8 's is rare in that the gene mutation predicts the disorder			1
but for most people , common diseases and traits result from combinations of both nature and nurture -- multiple genes , along with various environmental and other factors			1
so , a particular mutation may contribute in some small way toward a disease or trait , but it would not be the sole determinant			0
a gene mutation might double your chance of getting a particular disease ; say your risk may rise from 5 % to 10 % , but you would still have a 90 % chance of never getting the disease			2
@entity142 dilemmas emerge concerning for which genes doctors should use @entity56 , and who should decide			0
most @entity147 countries ban or heavily restrict use of this technology to serious diseases like @entity8 's -- not gender			1
in contrast , the @entity152 does n't have laws governing when it can or can not be used			0
for example , the procedure has been used to avoid embryos with the gene that increases the risk of breast cancer , though the disease would n't affect the child for perhaps 40 or 50 years			1
individuals with one of the breast cancer mutations can have their breasts and ovaries removed to prevent disease			2
also , by 2065 , treatments may exist			0
and what about gene mutations that have , say , a 20 % or 30 % chance of causing disease when the child is in midlife ? should parents discard an embryo based on that percentage ? this technology is expensive -- about $ 20,000 for each cycle of @entity182 -- and many insurance companies do not cover most of the cost			1
hence , wealthy parents can afford to eliminate certain diseases from their offspring , while poorer and middle - class parents will not be able to do so			1
consequently , over time , certain disease will become relegated to certain social groups , but not others			0
the gap between the wealthiest 1 % and everyone else is already expanding			0
should we allow this method to widen it more in the genetic pool ? some people argue yes : wealthy parents can already afford to send their children to private schools , private tutors , @entity202 prep classes , while other parents can not do so			0
but eliminating diseases is in some ways more extreme			2
others see this technology as raising troubling issues of eugenics , which had horrific results under the @entity211 , who sought to " purify " the gene pool in @entity214 , and eliminate people whom they felt were genetically inferior			1
the film " @entity221 " and @entity219 's 1932 novel , " @entity220 , " depict the dark problems that can ensue			0
so far , we have allowed parents to choose when to use this procedure			0
government regulations might be cumbersome			0
the @entity227 , the professional organization for physicians working in this area , has issued some guidelines , permitting broad use , but these are not really enforced			0
yet many patients , and even doctors , know little about this technology			2
more education of both physicians and the public is critical			0
we also need broad discussion and debate about what is at stake , and where to draw the line			1
" how beauteous mankind is , " @entity244 exclaims optimistically in " @entity245			0
" " oh brave new world , that has such people in it ! " @entity219 used these words ironically			0
between her hope and his pessimism may lie the reality -- depending on how we all now respond			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity259 .			1

@entity259 : testing to screen embryos of gene mutations raises ethical issues
@entity259 : the upside is it can eliminate mutations that cause untreatable diseases
but this technology can be *abused* and some may use it for selective breeding , he says
@entity259 : we need to know where to draw the line and not cross over into eugenics
