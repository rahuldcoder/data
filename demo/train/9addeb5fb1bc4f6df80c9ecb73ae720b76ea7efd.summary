editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			1
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity5 ) -- @entity18 has spent most of his 81 years in complete solitude and isolation			1
since 1965 he 's worked as a gaucho -- the horse - riding ranchers and shepherds of the harsh southern swath of @entity25 and @entity26 known as @entity27			1
for most of his life , @entity18 's sole human contact has occurred once every two years , when he herds his cattle to the nearest town to sell			1
the gaucho lifestyle , which essentially consists of hunting and herding , has remained constant since the colonial era			0
to say these guys are lonesome is an understatement -- this is n't like moving to the country and starting a blog about local varieties of heirloom carrots			0
but @entity18 was n't always alone			1
he was raised on the shores of @entity44 in a place known as once @entity46 , which is named after his family of 11 brothers and sisters			0
over the years , the siblings moved away one by one			2
then their parents died , their houses were burned down by vengeful neighbors , and the land was sold			0
@entity18 eventually moved to @entity26 , traveling the country and honing the skills that would allow him to eventually return to @entity44 and live off the land for the next 46 years			1
while @entity26 @entity27 can be barren and almost desert - like , @entity27 is rugged in the classical sense			1
it 's peppered with craggy , @entity61 mountains , dense forests and sparse pockets of civilization			0
@entity44 is located in the @entity66 © n region , one of the most remote areas of @entity27			1
it 's the least populated region in @entity25 , and one of the most sparsely populated places in the world outside @entity73			0
the closet thing to an urban center is a place called @entity77 , in which more than half of the region 's 100,000 residents reside , and smaller frontier settlements are home to fewer than 500 people , such as @entity84 where @entity18 sells his livestock			1
like most of the developing world , @entity18 's land is rapidly changing			1
the transformation began shortly after the @entity89			0
in the mid- 1970s , @entity25 and @entity26 became involved in what came to be known as the @entity91 , a territorial dispute over the nearby @entity93 , @entity93 , and @entity93 islands			0
this kerfuffle served as the main reason for @entity25 's support of the @entity97 during the @entity89 , another convoluted and somewhat silly conflict over a few chains of islands off the coast of @entity26 that the @entity97 had long claimed as their own			0
at the time , @entity25 's dapper general - turned - dictator @entity101 was in command and decided that @entity25 needed a highway to make its far - flung regions more accessible to the military			2
see the rest of @entity18 's @entity107 at @entity5 so , in 1976 , the @entity108 began construction on the @entity110 , forever changing @entity27 and its residents			1
by 1986 , a mostly unpaved road connected remote communities throughout the country , and the @entity27 military finally had easy access to the @entity117			2
due to the increased road access , the area developed a nascent yet thriving adventure - tourism industry based out of towns like @entity77 in the @entity123 and @entity124 and @entity125 in the @entity117			2
@entity84 , however , has remained somewhat isolated despite all of the recent developments			0
it was only accessible by plane until 2000 , when the final 62 miles of the 770 - mile road finally linked the remote village to the rest of the highway ( via an hour - long ferry ride to @entity134 )			2
@entity18 lives 20 or so miles from @entity84 , but those miles are of the @entity27 @entity27 variety			1
it takes him several days to make his biennial trip , wrangling his cattle up precarious switchbacks , along the sides of ravines , through rapid mountain rivers , and , eventually , to town			0
he lived like this , without really seeing another soul outside his biannual trips into town , for about 35 years , until the boats came			2
first , about a decade ago , a government ship began cruising the lake weekly for whatever reasons the government had deemed important			0
then came the semiweekly tourist ship that would take sightseers to the @entity155 -- a favorite among the global warming picture - taking set			2
at 81 years old , @entity18 is still spry and still does n't go to town very often , but he has somewhat adapted to the changes surrounding him			1
now he retrieves his supplies from the boat and generates electricity via a solar panel , and he even recently got a new neighbor			0
the world is catching up to him , but it 's a safe bet that whatever time @entity18 has left will be spent staying as far away from civilization as he can manage .			1

@entity5 meets an 81 - year - old man who has spent most of his life in complete isolation
@entity18 lives in @entity27 ; only human contact came once every two years
as development changes his surroundings , @entity18 has had to adapt
