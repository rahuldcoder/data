-- " i do not believe we can keep doing the same thing for over five decades and expect a different result , " president @entity0 pronounced wednesday			0
" moreover , it does not serve @entity8 's interests , or the @entity10 people , to try to push @entity10 toward collapse			1
" and with these words , @entity0 introduced a long - absent element of lucidity into @entity16 policy approaches to @entity10			1
on the @entity10 side , president @entity17 also welcomed the renewal of dialogue and committed his government to work with the @entity16 to resolve " profound differences " on a host of issues			2
the implications of the action go far beyond @entity0 abandoning an utterly anomalous policy , one without internal logic , one that was both counterproductive and contradictory -- a policy in fact that contributed to the very conditions it professed to abhor			0
to speak to @entity10 is to speak to @entity8			2
it is a powerful affirmation of a @entity16 willingness to respect the propositions of national sovereignty and self - determination in a region of the world where centuries of colonialism have made the pursuit of national sovereignty and self - determination something of national obsession			1
it is an acknowledgment that history does matter , and that a shared awareness of that history can not but result in salutary outcomes			0
the commitment to normalize diplomatic relations also signals the end of a policy that had as its overriding objective the overthrow of the @entity10 government			2
the idea was to use economic sanctions to induce calamity , make daily life as difficult and as grim as possible , and increase @entity10 suffering as a means to foment popular disaffection in the hope that @entity10 people , driven by want and motivated by despair , would rise up against their government			0
this has served as the cornerstone of a half - century policy			0
" the only foreseeable means of alienating internal support is through disenchantment and disaffection based on economic dissatisfaction and hardship , " a @entity75 official insisted in a memo in 1960 , and thereupon proceeded to call for actions designed " to bring about hunger , desperation and ( the ) overthrow of government			0
" the president 's assertion that it is not in @entity16 interests to push @entity10 toward collapse is a remarkable policy reversal			1
but it is also true that to signal the end of a policy of " regime change " has far - reaching implications in @entity10			2
for much of the last 50 years , and especially since the collapse of the @entity100 , @entity16 policy has served as a means for the @entity10 leadership to sustain moral authority			1
the @entity16 has represented a looming threat to @entity10 national sovereignty -- that is , @entity10 national security			1
as @entity16 have learned in the last dozen years , the invocation of " national security " does not readily accommodate to the demands of civil liberties			0
a commitment to ease economic sanctions serves to counter the perception of the @entity16 as a threat to @entity10 sovereignty , thereby denying those in @entity10 the pretext of @entity16 hostility to limit public debate and restrict civil liberties			1
the change of policy represents a momentous occasion -- rare indeed in @entity16 - @entity8 relations -- where the @entity16 are signaling a desire to engage the @entity10 on the basis of mutual respect , to engage @entity10 in normal political and economic interactions , and thereby contribute to the creation of space in which @entity10 themselves could proceed to address their most pressing issues , on their terms , within the logic of their own history , and act accordingly			1
it is a measure , in the end , of enlightened @entity8 self - interest			0
it shows respect for the @entity10 people by acting on the premise that @entity10 themselves know what is in their best interest .			0

@entity146 : @entity0 normalizing relations with @entity10 an overdue moment of @entity16 lucidity
@entity146 : in @entity8 scarred by colonialism , move shows support for national sovereignty
he says it removes @entity10 leadership pretext for " moral authority " in face of @entity16 hostility
@entity146 : change in *misbegotten* @entity16 policy gives @entity10 space to decide own best interests
