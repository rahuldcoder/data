-- not long ago , i was very kindly invited to @entity2 , as a member of @entity5 's food industry			1
hundreds of very smart foodies turned up , having showered , shaved and left behind their stoves , whisks and knives			0
it is a funny thing seeing many of your contemporaries in suits and dresses when you 're used to seeing them in their whites and aprons			0
i spent most of the evening introducing myself or just observing the many groups of people that mingle at occasions like these			0
one group caught my eye for most of the evening			0
it was made up of gentlemen all dressed in military uniform -- rather splendid military uniforms , obviously designed for just such a royal occasion			0
it was not the uniforms or even the rows of medals on their chests , but the fact that military members were there at all			0
watch an interview with @entity39 what would the military be doing at a food gig at @entity2 ? well , the answer stopped me short , so short that i have been unable to think of much else since that rather uneventful night -- uneventful except for the firm handshake of @entity45			1
the answer in its simplest form was that the uniforms were the catering corps , a corps that has catered all over the world for @entity5 soldiers on every battlefield ever since men needed to fight and eat at the same time			1
the answer in its most shocking form was that these were the men who would be in control of the food in @entity5 should we face shortages			1
shortages ? yes , shortages , of oil , water and their means of distribution			2
shortages of flour , milk and eggs			0
shortages of meat , fruit and vegetables			2
in fact , should this country suffer from any number of potential problems with our oil - dependent food chain , our very lives could be in the hands of the small group of men standing in a corner in @entity2			1
all of @entity5 's superstar chefs had turned out for this event , but none was more important than the gentlemen who stood watching the rest of us , as we rather arrogantly walked around the room as if food would always be available to perform tricks with , to swear at and make jokes with			1
well , food security is a serious issue and i better find out as much as i can about it			2
@entity102 : @entity105 's @entity104 wish in @entity5 the big supermarkets dominate our food chain			1
@entity5 supermarkets are some of the best in the world at controlling , manipulating and delivering cheap food			1
controlling food and its distribution takes a huge amount of money and energy , but because the @entity5 food producer could not keep up with the supermarkets ' demands for ever - lower prices , the supermarkets have moved to buying globally			1
they turned to the products provided by cheap labor in northern and southern @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128			2
but in shifting from @entity5 to the world , our supermarkets managed to destabilize @entity5 's food infrastructure			1
the supermarkets have left behind farmers , milk producers and fishermen			1
they all have knowledge they should be passing down , but there is no new blood wanting to pick up the rake , the fishing net or the gate latch at 4 a.m. @entity102 : @entity143 gives a plant eye 's view there is no money in food production in @entity5 : the supermarkets have taken the potential for a decent living away			1
the cost to produce milk is higher than the supermarkets are willing to pay			2
the cost of meat is too high , and the cost of fish is too high			0
but the supermarkets reply that they are only trying to " give the customers what they want , " so they must go abroad			0
in this statement is the manipulation			0
we as customers are led to believe that the low costs we pay are borne by the supermarkets			0
it is the producers in this country who are paid such low prices by the supermarkets for their produce that they are going out of business by the hundreds every year , and with it goes their knowledge			1
the supermarkets are not delivering cheap food , it is the farmers and producers of @entity5 , and now the world -- and at a cost to the environment too			1
increased yield means increased use of fertilizers , pesticides and antibiotics in animals			0
about 30 % of fresh food is thrown away in supermarkets every day , although they will deny it			1
@entity5 households are throwing an estimated 30 % of their food away too			1
where are we going with this over-producing , over-consuming super-cheap food system ? we are going global with a huge reliance on oil			1
@entity102 : @entity203 on the world 's killer diet but when the oil stops flowing , and our systems fail , no safety procedures are in place to help us			1
no localized food networks , and no agricultural schools developing our next wave of farmers -- this in a country where the average age for a farmer is 64			2
it feels to me as if we are becoming so overly reliant on our supermarket system , that when it breaks down , all we can turn to is military intervention			0
surely we should be striving to teach and educate people how to feed themselves			0
how to grow food and distribute it locally			0
how to barter for food items that can bring the essential vitamins and minerals for healthy life			0
be mindful of what supermarkets are doing and demand to see their business practices			2
compost as much as you can , eat as locally and as seasonally as you can			0
we are stronger as a group than an individual			0
think in a cooperative and communal way , set up local food hubs and create growing communities			2
i have tried to create that type of idea in @entity246 , and hope that it grows in popularity			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity39 .			2

@entity39 : @entity5 supermarkets control and deliver very cheap food
@entity255 : they buy cheap food globally , driving local producers out of business
dairy and meat farmers , fishermen are becoming a *vanishing* breed , he writes
consumers must work for fresh , *sustainable* food systems not reliant on oil , he writes
