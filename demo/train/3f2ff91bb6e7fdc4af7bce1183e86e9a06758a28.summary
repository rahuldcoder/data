-- managers @entity1 and @entity3 were involved in an unseemly touchline spat as @entity5 went back to the top of the @entity7 with a controversial 2 - 0 win at @entity9			1
@entity1 's @entity5 had taken an early lead through @entity11 when the verbal confrontation occurred after @entity13 had an apparent equalizer from @entity15 chalked off by referee @entity16			1
he ruled that @entity17 , who was in an offside position , was interfering with play , but the decision infuriated @entity3			0
he confronted fourth official @entity21 and with the benches from both teams drawn into the argument , @entity3 also directed some of his venom in the direction of @entity28			0
" @entity1 said something to me on the touchline which i was n't happy with , it was normal banter where i probably used words i should n't have in the heat of the moment and i apologize for that , " admitted @entity3 after the match			0
@entity3 was given a two - match ban for pushing a referee last season and it remains to be seen what action the @entity43 takes after receiving reports from the officials			0
@entity1 , who was angered by a foul on @entity48 by @entity49 , which saw the @entity52 star stretchered off , tried to play down the incident			0
" nothing important was said on the touchline between me and @entity3 , but i think it 's impossible for the referee to handle a game when every time he gave a decision against @entity13 there were complaints , " he said			2
he has overseen a 16 - match unbeaten run for his expensively - assembled side , which has gone a point clear of @entity65 at the top of the @entity7			1
@entity67 , who play @entity69 monday , can reclaim first place with a victory in a tight title race			0
@entity11 's eighth - minute goal and a late strike from @entity75 in stoppage time sealed the victory			2
in between , @entity78 made some fine saves to deny @entity80 and @entity81 as @entity13 pressed for the leveler			0
@entity83 later revived their faltering challenge with a pulsating 5 - 3 victory at @entity86 as @entity87 scored twice			1
his 32nd - minute strike allied to an earlier own goal from @entity90 put @entity83 2 - 0 ahead until the home side hit back through former @entity93 duo @entity92 and @entity94			1
a @entity96 penalty after @entity97 was fouled and @entity87 's second opened up the two - goal cushion again before @entity99 gave @entity86 late hope			1
substitute striker @entity101 , making his return from an ankle injury that had sidelined the @entity104 international since late november , snuffed that out with the clinching fifth with @entity83 moving back to fourth , five points adrift of @entity5 .			2
