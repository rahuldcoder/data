@entity0 , @entity1 -- in short order , freed miner @entity3 dispatches with some of the myths swirling around the 33 men rescued from the depths of the earth this week : he has no plans to write a book about what he endured in the @entity15 mine , he is n't going to sue anyone for the collapse , and he intends to go back to working in the area 's mines			1
" just not that one , " @entity3 says			1
all day friday in the hardscrabble mining town of @entity21 , @entity3 's family and neighbors ready the @entity22 home for his arrival from the nearby hospital			1
all 33 men underwent a barrage of medical testing to see how their record days of imprisonment underground had affected them mentally and physically			2
all but two miners were released from the hospital friday , and all the men are expected to make a full recovery			2
the @entity3 family was particularly hard hit by the collapse			1
two of the other trapped miners , @entity37 and @entity39 , are @entity3 's cousins			1
" welcome home @entity45 , " one neighbor said as she carried a handwritten sign greeting the miner into his home			1
" if @entity48 has given you a new life and chance , grab on to it with everything you have			1
" the family has received gifts			2
while @entity3 's brother @entity57 waits under the scorching sun of @entity1 's @entity60 desert , he nervously toys with a brand new @entity62 media player			1
an anonymous gift left for the now famous miner			2
@entity57 said his brother is tough and untouched by how close he came to dying in the dark recesses of the earth			1
" we missed him a lot , " @entity57 said			1
but for him its just like another shift			2
as if he worked for eight hours and came home			0
if @entity3 has troubling memories of his long , forced stay in the mine , so far he has n't shared them with his brother			1
" he 'll tell me at some point , " @entity57 said			1
" what happened , what he lived through			0
" inside the @entity81 house are hints of how he passed the long weeks of eternal darkness			0
two @entity85 flags decorate a wall in a courtyard behind the @entity3 's home			1
in carefully etched blue ink @entity3 drew a miner with a drill over a 33 on the white section of the flag			1
below , each miner wrote his name and put his signatures in ordered columns			0
" for you with all my heart , " @entity3 wrote his mother @entity98			1
the flags were a gift for her 50th wedding anniversary and were delivered by way of the " paloma " tube system that sent food and letters to the men			0
" he likes to play the guitar , accordion and organ , " @entity109 said with pride about her son , who learned to play the instruments without any formal training			0
" we are going to have a nice party for him			0
" but for the guest of honor just getting to the party will be almost as difficult as the previous legs of his journey			0
as the afternoon wears on , more and more media trickle into the neighborhood			0
tripods and cameras are posted like sentries in front of the @entity81 home			0
it has all the makings of an ugly media scene			0
so photographers agree and shake hands that all will stay in a fixed line so everyone can get an unobstructed shot of @entity3 's homecoming			1
but hours later as @entity3 steps from a van , a still photographer lurches forward and the plan is scrapped			1
pushing against the wave of cameramen , @entity85 police nearly have to carry the miner into his family 's home			0
one of the photographers gets into a showing match with an officer after the melee			0
as the party gets under way , though , clapping and joyous chants of " @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity1 , " can be heard from outside the house			0
then journalists still hanging around the house receive an invitation to come in and speak with the miner			0
@entity3 appeared understandably worn from his ordeal and the crush of media attention			1
as reporters ask him questions , he looks down			0
his voice is soft and his answers are clipped			0
" that was quite something , " he said simply of the august 5 mine collapse			2
" that was something very ugly			0
" he said he has been to @entity176 , where family members waited for the miners ' rescue			2
" i do n't need to go back , " he said			2
@entity3 said he missed his family terribly while in the mine			1
and , he said , he has become someone who " thinks more about @entity48			1
" " we were a team , " he said of the 33 men			0
" but all the same there were problems			0
so much time together , like any family , the problems start but were ones we worked out			0
" other miners have told @entity2 that the 33 men swore an oath never to discuss the details of what took place as the men struggled to survive in the mine			2
before he goes back to the party , @entity3 makes it clear he is not completely free of the mine			1
" down there you were always tired and did n't have any nightmares , " he said			2
" here you have nightmares until you realize you are out			0

@entity45 , two of his cousins were trapped in the @entity15 mine
@entity57 says his brother is tough and untouched by how close he came to dying
@entity3 says he does n't feel the need to visit @entity176
@entity3 says he has become someone who " thinks more about @entity48 "
