-- the hospital emergency room is the front door of the health care system			2
most people will only have to visit a handful of times in their lives , but visiting an @entity9 can be both a lifesaving and frightening experience			1
however , several myths prevail about what happens in the er and what you can expect			1
here are five that need to be declared doa			2
myth : the er is not like tv actually , television shows like " er " and even " scrubs " do not stray far from the truth			1
while it 's not like television all the time , the @entity9 can be an exciting and dangerous place , as seen in many episodes			1
in fact , emergency nurses are frequently attacked , verbally and physically , by patients			2
a 2007 survey of more than 3,000 emergency room nurses found that more than half the nurses surveyed had been spit on , hit , pushed or shoved , scratched or kicked by patients			2
about a fourth of nurses said they had experienced more than 20 of these types of episodes over three years			2
however , i 've seen many of these same nurses chase and retrieve confused patients when they wander away			2
we handle these incidents with levity while in the trenches , but the truth is that the @entity9 can be a very violent place to work , and there are few reporting mechanisms for these attacks			1
while drugs , alcohol and mental illness play a role in many incidents , this provides little solace after being assaulted in your workplace			2
if and when you come to the hospital , bringing empathy for the nurses and staff goes a long way			2
myth : patient satisfaction is our no. 1 priority everyone is entitled to a courteous visit to the emergency room just as you are entitled to a courteous visit to @entity72			0
however , if you order a shrimp taco at a burger restaurant , you ca n't have it , no matter how upsetting this may be or how much you may want it			1
we probably wo n't be able to diagnose a skin rash that 's been present for three years , nor can we tell you exactly why your knee hurts if it 's not broken			1
the er is designed to identify and treat time - sensitive conditions			1
as a patient , your only legal entitlement is to a medical screening exam , which essentially is for conditions that need to be remedied quickly in order to save your life			0
a 2012 study published in @entity90 showed that higher patient satisfaction scores are associated with higher health care expenditures and higher mortality			0
patients frequently enter into the emergency department expecting antibiotics for the common cold or a cat scan of the head			0
they equate patient satisfaction with " customer satisfaction			0
" while it 's very trendy to say so , patients are not exactly customers			0
physicians have a fiduciary role to maintain , as most of us know what can kill humans and are ethically and legally bound not to administer it			0
in many emergency departments , you may be able to demand more tests , but you should know that receiving them may not always be in your best interest			0
myth : @entity117 will make my er more crowded the real answer about how crowded a single er will become this year is dependent on a lot of regional factors such as the number of primary care providers and the privileges of physician extenders ( such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants ) in a given state			1
i work in one of the busiest emergency departments in the country			0
we were busy in 2012 , 2013 , and we will probably be just as busy in 2014			0
if people think they have an emergency , they come to the @entity9 research has shown that most patients who come to the @entity9 believe they have a life - threatening condition			1
also , a study in the @entity90 showed huge overlap in the initial @entity9 complaints of people with " primary care treatable " ( could have seen their doctor ) conditions and those with truly emergent complaints			1
any med student knows that chest pain from something as simple as acid reflux can be indistinguishable from that of a heart attack			0
the people who are in the @entity9 with you , @entity117 or not , will likely believe they have an emergent condition			1
myth : i should n't let the doctor put me in observation actually , observation units are awesome			1
about a third of @entity162 hospitals have them			0
these are dedicated patient care areas , typically staffed with emergency physicians , that are designed to rapidly treat or diagnose a handful of conditions like pneumonia , asthma , and chest pain			0
in hospitals without these units , patients with relatively simple conditions may be spread throughout the hospital			1
patients in observation units generally stay between 16 and 24 hours			1
these dedicated areas have shown superior outcomes compared to traditional care in terms of length of stay , missed diagnoses and mortality			0
further , as reported in @entity188 , these units are so efficient that if they were instituted in the other two - thirds of hospitals , they would save our health system billions			1
unfortunately , there have been reports of senior citizens being placed in " observation status " and having received hefty bills from hospitals because of it			1
there was even a class action lawsuit against the @entity201 and @entity202 alleging that hospitals use " observation status " to punish seniors by making them responsible for more of their bill			1
even though this case was dismissed in 2013 , media outlets occasionally show stories of seniors who have large hospital bills related to " observation status , " further perpetuating this myth			1
the reality is that while the issue remains very complex , the vast majority of @entity202 receiving seniors ( 94 % ) pay less under " observation status " than if they were admitted under " inpatient status , " according to the @entity221 ' office of inspector general			2
myth : the @entity9 is first - come , first - served we do not go in order of arrival time			1
we use the tried - and - true triage system where sicker patients are seen first			2
trust me when i tell you that you do n't want this any other way			2
if your loved one is shot in the face , you would want them to be seen first			0
you can not and will not be in control of the order of patients seen			0
no one in the emergency department has made an appointment			0
the national average length of stay for an @entity9 patient is about five hours			1
during this stay , we can often obtain testing that would generally take you months to receive			0
americans who are acutely ill actually visit their personal physician a minority of the time			0
as @entity254 physician dr. @entity253 described in @entity188 , emergency medicine physicians see 28 % of these acute visits , but make up less than 5 % of the physician workforce			0
@entity257 and many other practitioners of emergency medicine chose this specialty because of the " help anyone , anytime , anywhere " aspect of the job			0
when you come to the @entity9 , be prepared for some of the best medicine our health care system has to offer			1
this is not a jail ; everyone is free to leave if they are unsatisfied with the wait or availability of services , but rest assured , we will be happy to see you at any time for any complaint			0
the opinions expressed are solely those of dr. @entity281 .			0

visiting an er can be both lifesaving and frightening
knowing what to expect and what the @entity9 can and ca n't do is helpful
observation units can be very helpful
the @entity9 is not first - come , first - served
