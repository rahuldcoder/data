@entity0 -- @entity2 stands in the kitchen of her @entity5 home , warming food and setting out cutlery for her guests			1
another humid summer day in the @entity10 nears its end			0
she is hosting a dinner party tonight with numerous families attending , and her guests are slowly trickling through the door			0
" salaam - a - lakom , " she says , greeting her guests as they enter the foyer			0
the women are in headscarves , and the men are in modest attire			0
they respond cordially and thank @entity2 , also known as @entity21			1
@entity21 is hosting @entity22 , the meal in which @entity23 break their @entity24 fast			1
it is often celebrated in a community setting such as this			0
@entity21 says she was raised as a devout @entity28 but converted to @entity29 17 years ago			1
like many young people , she searched for meaning in her life after graduating from college			0
" i started to meet people of different faiths , " she says			0
" the @entity23 i met , i really connected with			0
i started asking about the teachings , and i just connected with the ideas			0
" @entity21 's features immediately give away her @entity40 heritage			1
one ca n't help but wonder what it 's like to see life through her eyes			2
" it 's a blessing , honestly , " she says , her green eyes sparkling from within the framing of her headscarf			2
" i know that there 's a lot that 's in the news , but the everyday life experience of a @entity23 and as an @entity54 is that people have decent values			2
they value life , and they value different cultures			0
i ca n't say it 's hard			2
i would feel guilty saying that it 's hard			2
" spate of attacks trouble @entity54 @entity23 in an elegant comparison , @entity21 relates her strict @entity28 upbringing to her current devotion to @entity29			1
" i really valued faith , " she says			0
" i mean it 's kind of ironic that i 'm looking like the nuns that i admired			2
" the sound of prayer playing from an @entity73 echoes through her house			0
it is time for her and her patrons to break their fast			2
the men and women move to separate rooms and sit around their respective tables			0
in keeping with the tradition of the @entity84 's practices , they eat three dates to begin the breaking of their fast			1
depriving oneself of water and food , from sunrise to sunset , is the core practice of @entity24			1
a moderate muslim will only honor the fast , but a pious believer 's day is filled with prayer and reflection			1
" the miracle of it is that @entity101 has partnered the fast with the prayer , " says @entity21			1
" it 's an opportunity to purify ourselves , and either one by itself does not work			1
" after only a few dates and small sips of water , the guests file into their respective prayer rooms , separated by gender			0
they will recite a final prayer before sitting down to the hostess 's elaborate dinner			2
the house is quiet and serious , as @entity21 's husband , @entity117 , sings out the prayer			1
it is an awe - inspiring moment , showcasing discipline and devotion in its barest form			0
this home in suburban @entity0 is suddenly transformed into a house of @entity29 worship			1
more than 20 minutes later , the prayers are over , and it is time to feast			2
tonight , @entity21 and her family provide the bounty of food they set out on the table			1
the guests line up to eat , as @entity117 piles food on each plate			0
this evening , @entity21 's family and friends are among their peers			1
every adult in her home tonight abides by the strict demands of @entity29 and @entity24			1
in predominantly @entity23 countries , laws strictly enforce @entity24 , banning eating and drinking in public during daylight hours			1
in the @entity149 , most people do n't observe @entity24 , so for the relatively few @entity23 there , doing so can be a challenge			1
" sometimes , you are the only fasting person in your workplace or your classroom , " explains @entity151 , speaker at the @entity152 in metro @entity0			2
" @entity156 is not practicing , but you 're practicing			0
so you feel that you are doing this alone			0
it 's not easy , but we do it because we believe that the order came from @entity101 , and you should do it wherever you are			2
" ' do n't call me late for @entity22 ' this month , more than 1 billion muslims around the world are celebrating @entity166 , which officially ends the @entity29 month of @entity24			1
many hope that they can continue to emulate the spirit and generosity of this month throughout the year			0
" the idea is to go back to life better than when we entered @entity24 , " says @entity21			1
" to try to improve ourselves and @entity174 ( ' @entity175 willing ' ) improve the world through that process			0
" by the end of the night , the dinner is done , and @entity21 and her guests sit and share stories of how they cope with fasting and the other strict rules of @entity24			1
but no one ever questions its purpose or its value			0
they feel purified by it , ready to begin another year of life , reflection , love and personal growth .			0
