-- one of the world 's largest pulp and paper companies is destroying @entity6 's rainforests and taking away the habitat of rare animals , environmental group @entity1 charged tuesday			1
the @entity1 report accuses @entity10 of " relentlessly trashing rainforests , driving species extinction and , if left unchecked , will threaten @entity6 's efforts to address climate change			1
" @entity10 , a division of @entity15 , denied the charges levied by @entity1 , including the alleged expansion of logging operations by 17 million hectares ( 42 million acres )			1
" the allegations are totally illogical and untrue , @entity10 has no plans for the expansions in question , " said @entity19 , an @entity10 spokeswoman , who said the @entity6 government has publicly announced that their quota for pulp and paper is 10 million hectares ( 25 million acres ) by 2014			1
" i urged @entity1 to do a proper research before putting such allegations " @entity19 added			2
@entity15 , which also has a palm oil arm , has long be a target of @entity1 efforts to curb deforestation			2
the environmental group says the land cleared for palm oil plantations , and for pulp and paper products is doing long - term damage to @entity6 's rainforests and the environment			1
@entity1 says a $ 1 billion deal between @entity42 and @entity6 announced in may to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through a moratorium on logging has a loophole that would allow @entity10 to clear sensitive forest and peatlands			1
" millions of hectares of forests -- including hundreds of thousands of hectares under @entity15 control -- are not part of the deal with @entity42 , " said @entity49 , a @entity50 forest campaigner			0
" this loophole will undermine all attempts to reduce @entity6 's emissions			2
president ( @entity60 ) @entity60 must act immediately by implementing a moratorium on all forest destruction and ensure the protection of peatlands			0
only then will we be able to really reduce @entity6 's ghg emissions			2
" @entity6 is one of the world 's largest emitters of greenhouse gases because of rampant clearing and burning of its forests and peat lands for logging and conversion into palm oil plantations			1
the country has long been a target of harsh criticisms from environmental groups who have accused the government of failing to enforce its own laws			0
@entity60 said in may that @entity6 would " conduct a moratorium for two years where we stop the conversion of peat land and of forest			0
" he was joined by @entity42 prime minister @entity91 , who said @entity42 would provide $ 1 billion to @entity6 to help with the effort to reduce deforestation			0
" @entity6 is a key country in terms of reducing deforestation			0
therefore this agreement and @entity6 's commitment is a great step forward in achieving large - scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions , " @entity91 said			1
@entity60 said the halt on new concessions would start in 2010 as part of a broader strategy to reduce the nation 's greenhouse gas emissions by at least 26 percent by 2020			0
deforestation accounts for almost a fifth of total greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change			0
the @entity6 - @entity42 partnership to cut emissions is part of a broader international strategy called @entity115 , or @entity115 , that would make stored carbon dioxide in tropical forests a commodity that can be bought and sold on the global market .			0
