-- @entity1 : what is less popular than herpes , self - inflicted stupidity at its worst , and a gift to the @entity8 's tax reform agenda ? answer : the @entity10 ' $ 4.1 million 2010 @entity9 , where an on - stage artist was paid $ 17,000 to demonstrate " painting as a learning tool			1
" note to the @entity10 : @entity14 will paint your next conference for $ 400 , plus room and board , if @entity18 fails to convince president @entity19 to shut you down			1
( we have heightened confidence , in light of @entity25 's cell phone record - collecting , that the @entity26 is indeed listening to @entity28 podcast )			2
rarely do we kick off a @entity28 podcast with unanimous outrage			2
the @entity10 , our least beloved federal agency , has managed to unite us			1
in my view , while waste , fraud and abuse is rampant in the federal government , this episode will prove especially helpful to the @entity39 ' agenda to pass radical tax simplification measures before the 2014 congressional elections			0
next in the discussion : is heckling an effective political tactic ? increasingly , some @entity45 activists believe heckling is responsible for advancing their political agenda and @entity47 ( @ locs_and_laughs ) chimes in on its value			1
in his @entity53 article in response to mrs. @entity19 's incident at a @entity58 fundraiser this week , @entity51 makes the case that heckling heightens attention to @entity45 issues , suggesting that every major progressive step for the lgbt community during president @entity19 's administration has occurred in response to a public heckling incident			0
for @entity14 , heckling is personal , and he offers constructive advice to the heckled			1
first , never give up control of the spotlight to a disruptive audience member			0
second , have a prepared zinger to quip back , like , " i do n't heckle you at work , i just come to @entity76 's and order a big mac and fries			0
" or , in the case of the first lady , @entity14 suggests she respond : " do you really want to heckle a person with access to drones ? " he offers other knee slappers , too			1
finally , " humble brag " alert on @entity86			1
the actor stoops to new lows while discussing his cancer and industrious sex life , but still manages to elevate the important health issue -- widespread @entity93 ( human papilloma virus )			0
while the details of his own cancer and comments appear confusing at best , it turns out @entity100 gov. @entity99 was right and @entity101 was wrong			0
the hpv virus is linked to cervical cancer and some types of head and neck cancer , which the hpv vaccine can eliminate if administered to children and young adults			0
@entity99 as a @entity8 presidential candidate argued in favor of the availability and administration of this vaccine , while @entity101 , in our view , ridiculously suggested it would lead to increased sexual activity for children ( which studies have disproved )			0
not quite the @entity123 class act that brought the breast cancer gene into the public consciousness by sharing her choice to undergo a proactive double mastectomy , but @entity86 ' disgusting bravado has still managed to contribute to public understanding of @entity93 ... ahh celebrity			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity132 .			2
