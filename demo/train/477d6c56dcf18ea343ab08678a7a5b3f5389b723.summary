-- @entity1 was poring over photos of galaxies on the internet in august 2007 when she stumbled across a strange object in the night sky : a bright , gaseous mass with a gaping hole in its middle			1
@entity1 made her discovery by poring over images of galaxies on an astronomy web site			2
" it looked a bit like an irregular galaxy , but i was n't sure what it was , " @entity13 said			0
so she posted a query on the web site of the @entity23 project , which encourages members of the public to join in astronomy research online			1
@entity13 is a 25 - year - old schoolteacher in @entity27 , @entity28 , not an astrophysicist			1
but her startling find -- a mysterious and unique object some observers are calling a " cosmic ghost " -- has captivated astronomers and even caught the attention of the people who run the @entity36 , who have agreed to take a closer look next year			1
" this discovery really shows how citizen science has come of age in the @entity4 world , " said @entity37 , professor of physics and astronomy at the @entity40 and a @entity23 team member			1
" there was a time when i spoke pejoratively of armchair astronomers			2
and i 've gotten up at a star party and publicly apologized for that			0
" not so long ago , the term " amateur astronomer " conjured images of stargazers peering through backyard telescopes			2
but today 's are as likely to be analyzing reams of sophisticated data collected by observatories and posted on space - related web sites			0
armchair observers like @entity61 increasingly are making significant contributions to science , said @entity64 , spokesman for the @entity65 , a group of 6,500 professionals			2
amateurs have been invited to present papers at recent @entity65 conferences , " which would n't have happened years ago , " he said			0
a successful example of amateur - professional collaboration , the @entity23 project was launched last year by @entity74 astrophysicist @entity73 and @entity75 at the @entity76 in @entity77			1
the pair were looking for help in cataloging archived photographs of galaxies -- one million images -- taken by the robotic @entity84 telescope in remote southern @entity85			0
knowing that the human eye is sometimes more sensitive than a computer at picking out unusual patterns -- and that they did n't have time to do all the work themselves -- @entity73 and @entity75 posted the images on the @entity23 web site last summer			1
the professors then invited amateur astronomers , with the help of a brief online tutorial , to classify the galaxies as spiral , elliptical or something else			1
online galaxy - sorting might not sound as fun as , say , surfing @entity103 , but it was an immediate hit			2
" we were overwhelmed by the response			0
it completely melted the server , " @entity73 said			0
" people tell us it 's addictive			0
some of [ the volunteers ] are professional astronomers , but most of them are not			2
they 're just regular people who got excited about the project			2
" during the past year , more than 150,000 armchair astronomers from all over the world volunteered their time , submitting more than 50 million classifications			1
the public 's collective wisdom -- the same principle that guides jury trials or @entity123 -- proved remarkably astute , @entity73 said			0
for example , if 33 of 36 volunteers thought a galaxy appeared elliptical , then astronomers could be confident the classification was correct , he said			0
@entity13 had been classifying photos on @entity23 for about a week when she came across the image that quickly became known as " @entity132 , " @entity28 for " object			1
" the primary school teacher does not own a telescope -- " my [ astronomy ] background does n't really go further than looking at the stars when walking outside in the evening , " she said -- but when she posted her finding august 13 on the @entity23 forum , the astronomers who run the site began to investigate			1
they soon realized @entity61 might have found a new class of astronomical object			1
the @entity23 team asked scientists working at telescopes around the world to take a look at the mysterious voorwerp			1
their best guess : the @entity132 is probably a cloud of hot gas punctured by a central hole 16,000 light years across and illuminated by the " dying embers " of a nearby quasar , @entity73 said			0
quasars are distant , highly luminous astronomical objects powered by black holes ; scientists suspect that light from the quasar still illuminates the voorwerp even though the quasar itself burned out in the past 100,000 years			0
" it 's this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe , " said @entity75 , the @entity76 scientist			0
" it 's rather like examining the scene of a crime where , although we ca n't see them , we know the culprit must be lurking somewhere nearby in the shadows			0
" @entity23 leaders are eagerly awaiting images from @entity176 's orbiting @entity36 , which is scheduled to train its powerful instruments on the @entity132 in 2009			1
in the meantime , van @entity1 is enjoying the fuss over her contribution to astronomy			0
" it 's amazing to think that ... amateur volunteers can help by spotting things like this online , " she said			1
" what excites me the most is that all of this leads to more interest in science			0

using the @entity194 , a @entity28 schoolteacher has discovered a strange astronomical object
the find *illustrates* how more amateur astronomers are contributing to science
the @entity23 project encourages the public to join in astronomy research online
@entity36 has agreed to take a closer look at the object next year
