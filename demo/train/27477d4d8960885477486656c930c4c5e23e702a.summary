-- q : i was shocked to read in the news that children as young as 7 are hurting themselves			2
why would they do that ? a : i 'm often surprised by what surprises people			0
this study , recently published in the journal @entity11 , has garnered tremendous media attention			1
the study found that approximately 8 % of third - grade students had at some point in their lives engaged in non-suicidal self - injury			1
examples of non-suicidal self - injury include hitting oneself , burning oneself , cutting or carving the skin and inserting sharp objects into the skin			2
although it is extremely distressing that children engage in these types of behavior , i do n't find it surprising it all			1
three other things surprise me a good deal more			0
first , i am surprised that , before this study , most people assumed that children would n't engage in a behavior that is so common in teenagers and young adults			1
why would we expect that non-suicidal self - injury would wait for puberty to make an appearance ? we already know that certain genetic mutations , for example the mutation that causes @entity42 , can produce horrific self - mutilating behavior in even very young children			1
while people report engaging in non-suicidal self - injury for various reasons , almost always , they hurt themselves in response to stressful situations or negative emotions			1
anyone who has children knows that they are subject to the same powerful emotions as adults			1
if a minority of adults responds to powerful emotions by harming themselves , why should children not do the same ? this leads directly to the second thing that surprises me : that children below the age of puberty are considerably less likely to deliberately harm themselves than are adolescents or young adults			1
this finding is consistent with a lot of literature showing that children have far lower rates of mood , anxiety and psychotic disorders than adults do			1
this fact is often taken for granted in the mental health world , but it is really quite remarkable and not well - understood			1
after all , children are subject to extremely powerful emotions and have a tremendous capacity for fear and worry			1
moreover , it is now very clear that childhood experiences are the strongest environmental determinants of developing mental illness as an adult			2
so why the delay ? if the stresses and strains of childhood light the fuse for psychiatric illness , why does it take so long for the fuse to burn ? i could fill pages with various theories , but i ca n't give a one - or two - sentence answer that encapsulates this unquestionable truth			2
the final thing about non-suicidal self - injury that surprises me is that it occurs at all			2
anyone who has been depressed can understand how one might feel bad enough to want to escape the psychic pain through death			0
but why do so many people hurt themselves not because they want to die but because they want to hurt themselves ? again , there is no simple answer , but i find it fascinating that other mammals have been observed to harm themselves when under stress			0
cats and dogs will lick and chew their bodies until they have wounds , and horses have been known to bite their own flanks			0
this suggests to me that self - injury might be related in some ways to a process , or processes , that have evolved over time			2
whether this is true or not , one thing is very clear : despite being painful , self - injurious behavior can become highly addictive			1
this is more often the case with women and usually involves cutting the skin , although i 've treated patients over the years who were addicted to other types of self - damaging behavior , such as hitting themselves in the face or inserting sharp objects into various bodily orifices			1
many people who cut on themselves report that this behavior has an irresistible pull ; they feel better after opening their skin , either because they are calmer or because the pain makes them feel more alive			2
these reports have led to widespread theorizing that people become addicted to self - injurious behavior because the tissue damage leads to the release of natural , opioid - type chemicals in the body , giving them a " natural high			1
" this idea immediately suggests that blocking such endogenous opioids with drugs might reduce or prevent cutting and other self - damaging behaviors			0
however , the fact that trials of opioid blockers have yielded conflicting and not very impressive results has lessened enthusiasm for these ideas			0
a final surprising truth about non-suicidal self - injury is that it exists in a complex relationship with actual suicidal behavior			1
you 'd think that people who recurrently injured themselves would be at increased risk of committing suicide , but this is far from clear			0
people who engage in non-suicidal self - injury typically are struggling with other psychiatric conditions , such as a mood or personality disorder , so they are at increased risk of suicide generally			0
but the degree to which non-suicidal self - injurious behavior itself contributes to this increased risk is not well understood			1
in fact , the demographics of suicide and non-suicidal self - injury suggest that in some ways they are polar opposites			0
most non-suicidal self - injury occurs in adolescent and young adult females and drops off sharply in prevalence with advancing age			0
on the other hand , most completed suicides occur in men , and the risk rises sharply with age			0
a study done a number of years ago really highlights this			0
young adult females make 25 suicide attempts for every one completed suicide			0
older men make 1.6 suicide attempts for every completed suicide			0
but , suicide attempts are only one kind of violence against the self			0
our growing understanding of this fact has led to a proposal by the @entity210 that non-suicidal self - injury be given its own diagnostic category in the next edition of the @entity214 , which is the " bible of psychiatric diagnoses " in the @entity217 although the last thing psychiatry needs in general is another diagnostic category , the upside of this proposal is that it makes official something many patients have been trying to tell us for years : that their apparent suicidal behavior is not really motivated by an urge to kill themselves			2
then we 'd be able to officially believe them .			0

study in @entity11 journal says 8 % of third - graders have *purposefully* injured themselves
children are subject to the same powerful emotions as adults , mental healthy expert says
despite being painful , self - injurious behavior can become highly addictive
