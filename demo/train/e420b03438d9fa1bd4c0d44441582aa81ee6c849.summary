laying the blame for @entity2 failures at the feet of a man who pledged , six long years ago , to fix those problems is inviting			1
during his 2008 @entity8 transition , president - in - waiting @entity6 promised to " make the @entity2 a leader of national health care reform so that veterans get the best care possible			1
" in his own eyes at least , this president remains unstained by that failure			2
shame remains unknown to this unnecessarily confident man			2
now , @entity6 not only tells us he is shocked to find that the crisis he has ignored is still there , he also insists , " i will not tolerate it			1
" if you ca n't fix the problem , of course , fix the politics			2
" @entity6 " often pretends to share our anger to defuse it			2
his performance art , however , has grown obvious and condescending			2
when he throws vacant words like candy to the masses , he only fuels our anger			2
still , as satisfying as it might be , we should n't assign blame entirely to our commander in chief			2
for decades , @entity35 , @entity36 and even veterans -- including gen. @entity37 , a man of unquestionable commitment and proven leadership skills -- have tried to reform the @entity2 's endless bureaucracy			1
at best , some have transformed the terrible to the merely awful			0
at worst , they have all failed wretchedly			0
perhaps the problem is neither a lack of will or brains , nor a shortage of effort or good intentions			1
perhaps they have not reformed the @entity2 because it can not be reformed			1
even the most devoted instructor ca n't teach a hammerlike old bureaucracy to be anything but the dull , blunt instrument it is			2
when the modern @entity2 arose , as veterans came home from @entity58 , health care was simpler			1
we were a decade from pacemakers , two from hip replacements and balloon catheters , three from the miracle of an mri			0
@entity65 had not been imagined , much less genomic testing , treatments for traumatic brain injuries and cures for half of all cancer patients			0
since then , caring for human health , like everything else in our lives , has become infinitely more complex			0
today , our health care needs are intimate , intricate and intensely personal			0
imagine , however , that your health care was managed and delivered by a machine , an old factorylike mechanism composed , not of cogs and gears and smokestacks , but of bureaucrats , regulations and mountainous paper work			0
today 's @entity2 , with 300,000 employees , is exactly such an industrial - age contraption			1
it 's the second largest bureaucracy in our federal government			1
the @entity2 is a glorified assembly line that excels at enforcing standardization , not delivering compassion , innovation , or personalized service			1
it is built to dispense soul - crushing conformity			0
confronted with providing services that require originality , adaptation and sensitivity , the @entity2 is lost			1
on what form does a bureaucracy measure compassion , originality , or the respect a veteran has earned ? and the worse the @entity2 bureaucracy performs , the angrier all of us become -- and we demand even more regulatory government action			1
the leviathan that is the @entity2 grows larger as bloat is piled upon excess			1
in a wonderful new book , " @entity110 : the @entity117 , " authors @entity111 and @entity113 note that enlarging the bureaucratic inadequacies of the modern industrial state are unlikely to improve it			0
instead , they found that fixing our government 's bloated bureaucracy with even " more state " inevitably leads to failure on an apocalyptic level : " ninety - four percent of federal it projects over the past ten years have failed -- more than half were delayed or over budget and 41.4 percent failed completely			1
" they note that , " the @entity129 spent over $ 3 billion on two health - care systems that never worked properly			0
" the @entity2 is government - run health care , financed by government , and delivered through government - run hospitals			1
@entity137 collectors of old social antiquities like @entity139 can not let go of it			0
@entity139 confesses , " yes , this is ' socialized medicine			0
' ... but it works , and suggests what it will take to solve the troubles of @entity147 health care more broadly			0
" document : @entity2 audit report released can the fix for the most outdated health care system in @entity147 really be more of the same ? the breach between what we fund and what veterans get from the @entity2 is getting larger			1
the gap between our good intentions and the help those in need actually receive is growing broader			1
it is time for something fresh			0
our old federal government 's inability to do what it promises is one reason it is less popular than @entity167 during the @entity168 and @entity169 , on a good day , has a favorability rating of approximately 9 %			1
instead of blaming @entity6 , i 'd urge @entity36 and @entity35 to propose real change : transform our old , closed bureaucratic va system to an open health care system			0
it 's time veterans who do n't want to travel five hours or wait for months were allowed equal access to all the health care available to the rest of us			0
the most critical decisions about a veteran 's health should n't be made the old way : top - down , politically and artificially , by a pulseless bureaucracy that reports to @entity187			2
those decisions should be made naturally and bottom - up , closer to life , in the sacred space between doctors and those who have offered the highest possible sacrifice to our nation			0
join us on @entity198 / @entity197 .			0

@entity200 says the path to the @entity2 crisis was paved with good intentions
the @entity2 is the second largest bureaucracy in our federal government
he calls the @entity2 " a glorified assembly line that excels at enforcing standardization "
