-- president @entity1 told a @entity3 crowd in @entity4 that he 's prepared to fight for a new job growth plan , defend organized labor and take steps to " restore the middle class in @entity12 , " while five @entity9 candidates hoping to defeat him next year all called for repealing the major legislation passed so far in @entity1 's presidency			1
the @entity9 presidential candidates participating in the @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19 , which was televised on @entity0 , were unified in advocating the end of the health care reform law and the @entity23 reform measure passed by a @entity25 - led @entity24			1
they also all expressed strong anti-abortion views and their belief in marriage being between a man and a woman at the event set up by sen. @entity32 , a leading tea party conservative			0
meanwhile , in the early primary states of @entity36 and @entity19 , other @entity9 presidential contenders ripped @entity1 's handling of the economy and pledged to take an economically battered @entity12 in a new direction marked by less spending and fewer regulations			1
the sharply differing visions raised new questions about the ability of top @entity25 and @entity9 to tackle pressing budgetary and other issues while positioning themselves for what promises to be a bitterly contested campaign next year			2
in a speech that likely previewed his scheduled address thursday to a joint session of @entity24 to present a jobs plan , @entity1 directly challenged @entity9 , whom he has accused of obstructing progress in order to score political points			1
" these are tough times for working @entity12 , " @entity1 told the union - dominated crowd at a rally that included a warm - up from @entity60			1
" the time for @entity64 games is over			0
the time for action is now			0
" saying @entity12 workers were ready to move ahead , he said , " we just need @entity24 to get on board " and later added : " we will see if congressional members will put country before party			2
" " we will give them a plan and then we will see if they want to create jobs , " the president said			2
@entity1 took credit for a series of controversial measures , including the health care overhaul , financial regulatory reform , the 2009 economic stimulus plan and the auto industry bailout			2
" i 've seen @entity4 prove the cynics and the naysayers wrong , " he said , referring to the @entity12 auto industry			2
" we 're fighting for good jobs with good wages ... ( and ) an economy where hard work pays off and gaming the system does n't work			2
" the president quoted a 1948 @entity3 speech delivered by president @entity95 in @entity4			1
like @entity1 , @entity95 ran for re-election that year against a largely hostile @entity9 - dominated @entity24			1
" the gains of labor were not accomplished at the expense of the rest of the nation , " @entity1 said , quoting @entity95			2
" @entity102 's gains contributed to the rest of the nation 's prosperity			0
" before @entity1 spoke , @entity106 , president of the @entity107 , blasted congressional republicans and urged the crowd to mobilize and help defeat the @entity9 at the polls in 2012			1
" everybody here has a vote , " @entity106 said			0
" keep the eye on the prize			0
let 's take these sons of bitches out and give @entity12 back to an @entity12 where we belong			0
" as @entity1 rallied @entity25 base voters in @entity122 , vice president @entity120 headed to @entity123 to attend an @entity125 @entity3 event			1
the @entity125 is a federation of 56 national and international labor unions			0
@entity1 carried @entity122 and @entity127 in 2008 , but both states , hit hard by the economic downturn , could prove challenging to keep in the @entity25 column in 2012			0
the @entity9 forum in @entity32 's home state of @entity19 , meanwhile , gave five of the top @entity9 candidates a chance to explain their stances on key issues to conservatives			1
@entity32 's endorsement is one of the most sought after among 2012 @entity9 @entity142 hopefuls , and his support would be a major boost for any @entity9 candidate in his home state 's pivotal early primary			1
former @entity149 gov. @entity148 initially declined @entity32 's invitation , saying he was concentrating on campaigning in @entity36 , which holds an even earlier primary			0
but after falling behind newcomer @entity153 gov. @entity152 in some polls , @entity148 apparently changed his mind , opting to wrap up a pancake breakfast event in @entity36 before traveling to @entity18 for @entity32 's forum			1
" the tea party is a powerful movement saying government 's too big , and i could n't agree more , " @entity148 told a crowd of roughly 450 people at the breakfast			0
in addition to @entity148 , rep. @entity165 of @entity166 , businessman @entity167 , former house speaker @entity168 and rep. @entity169 of @entity153 attended the @entity32 forum			1
all cited the @entity171 and its determination of @entity174 - given rights for citizens as the foundation of @entity12 government in a recitation of core conservative principles championed by the tea party movement			0
@entity152 was also slated to take part in @entity32 's forum but backed out monday morning to return to @entity153 as it battles growing wildfires			1
@entity152 did , however , participate in @entity9 rep. @entity185 's town hall series in @entity186 , @entity19 , before returning home			1
while in @entity186 , @entity152 sharply criticized @entity148 's job growth record in @entity149			1
" there 's one ( @entity9 candidate ) ... that 's created jobs all over the world , " @entity152 said , referring to @entity148 's oft - mentioned record in the private sector			1
" but while he was the governor of @entity149 , he did n't create very many jobs			0
" we can not choose a nominee ... that is going to blur the lines , " @entity152 added			0
the @entity9 needs " someone who has a very stark difference ( with ) the president of the @entity12 ... and i would suggest to you i 'm that person			2
" two other candidates not appearing at the event were also on the campaign trail monday			0
former @entity212 gov. @entity211 , drawing new attention after announcing his economic plan last week , wrapped up five days of events in @entity36 with a parade and a picnic , and former sen. @entity216 of @entity217 held three events in @entity19			2
former @entity220 gov. @entity219 , who has not announced whether she will run for president , was in @entity36 on @entity3 after three days in @entity222			0
" we 're up against ... @entity1 's very strange fundamental transformation of the country that we so love , " @entity219 said			1
" we do n't need a transformation			0
as you know , we need a fundamental restoration of all that is good and strong and free in @entity12			0
" @entity0 's @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232 and @entity233 contributed to this report .			0
