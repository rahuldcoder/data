-- speculation among political " analysts " has recently heated up around the idea that newly minted sen. @entity4 of @entity5 might pose a real challenge to @entity7 for the 2016 @entity9 presidential nomination			1
never mind that @entity10 has zero executive experience , has been in @entity12 for the blink of an eye and has spent much of her life as an academic -- because of course , that 's a formula that seems to have worked for the current occupant of the @entity20 ( if not , as at least half the rabid commenters beneath this column will also argue , for the country			1
) never mind that she has expressed no interest in the job			0
never mind that the election of 2016 is three full years away and that almost anything can happen in that time including , according to a recent study in the journal nature , many more asteroid strikes than we originally believed possible			2
facts and sound reasoning be damned			0
birds got ta fly and pundits got ta pundit			2
facts and probabilities do n't matter in this kind of demented parlor game			0
it 's about as useful as debating whether @entity44 -- if he were a scientific genius -- would devote himself to particle physics or mapping the human genome			1
it is a mania driven by the existential anxieties of the commentariat whose " i chatter therefore i am " philosophy implies that if they shut up they cease to exist			0
the result is a discussion about nothing , meaning precious little , and with not much to recommend other than its negligible entertainment value			0
but heck , @entity61 reportedly is now worth more than $ 20 billion ; investors have got to have people tweeting about something			0
it might as well be the debate about whether @entity10 's @entity68 stance would be tough for @entity69 to combat because she may be seen as too close to the establishment or , conversely , whether @entity10 's financial reform agenda would motivate the fat cats in the financial community to start writing fat checks for @entity69			0
speaking of which , this kind of speculation has not been limited to the @entity9			0
this week , aside from @entity81 's cheap shot on its cover about @entity85 gov. @entity84 's girth , we had a nasty comment from the ever - thoughtful @entity87 suggesting @entity84 's weight was an issue because " it 's been extreme , " and the party of @entity92 locked in a debate over whether one of its most successful governors was too tubby to be president			1
no one apparently remembers that @entity99 was not only @entity100 's only president to be so fat he got stuck in the @entity102 bathtub , but he was also our only chief executive to go on to become the head of a second branch of government as the chief justice			0
of course , i have to admit , @entity87 once again revealing her intellectual deficits while taking a shot at a fellow @entity111 's physical attributes is more entertaining than many new shows on television this fall ( " @entity116 " and " we are men " come to mind ) , but her remarks are still otherwise without redeeming social value			1
so , let 's take a collective chill pill , shall we ? let 's admit that all we know about 2016 is that those of us lucky to make it that far will be three years older and that ca n't be good news for hairlines or waistlines			1
let 's admit that it is how the economy is doing , the state of the world and how we feel about outgoing president @entity132 , and not carefully reasoned arguments by the people who gave us president @entity7 in 2008 that will ultimately decide who the candidates are			1
let 's admit that being able to run against @entity12 will be an advantage , as it has been for every candidate since the 1970s , and that the candidate offering the most optimistic view of @entity100 's future is likely to win -- as he or she typically does			1
let 's admit that that probably means the @entity111 candidate will be a current or former governor			0
and finally , let 's admit that sometimes just because the pundits say something is going to happen does n't mean it is n't true			1
which is why when all is said and done i still think @entity7 will be the @entity9 nominee and the next @entity156			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 .			2

@entity159 : pundits cook up buzz that @entity4 may run against @entity7 in 2016
he says there 's zero evidence ; it 's just *product* of commentariat 's need for news
he says 2016 guessing even has @entity81 , @entity87 weighing in on @entity84 's prospects
@entity159 : we know little about 2016 -- still , just because pundits say it , does n't make it false
