-- on june 17 , 1964 , president @entity1 explained to the @entity3 reporter @entity2 why he had to stay the course in @entity5 by stabilizing the @entity7 government so that it could fight communism			1
@entity1 rejected calls for withdrawal that were being made by liberal democrats as well as the proposal for neutralization promoted by @entity16 's @entity15			2
" so the only thing you 've got left , " @entity1 said , " is try to make this thing more efficient and more effective and hold as strong as you can and keep this government as stable as you can and try to improve it as you can and that we 're doing day and night			2
" during his recent speech at @entity24 , president @entity22 rejected the lessons that these kinds of stories tell us about @entity28			1
the president , saying that the comparison with @entity5 relies on a " false reading of history , " pointed to three differences			1
the first is that the @entity34 is now part of a broad international coalition			0
the second is that in @entity5 the @entity34 faced a " broad - based popular insurgency " whereas today , according to most polls , a large number of @entity28 support foreign assistance			1
@entity42 , @entity22 added , is that today @entity34 are responding to a very real threat that began with the vicious attack on 9/11			1
clearly , @entity22 feels defensive about this analogy and hopes to undercut liberal critics who are frustrated and disappointed with his decision			1
in trying to separate himself from the experience of @entity1 , however , @entity22 did not give an accurate account of what many commentators have been saying recently , and he downplayed crucial aspects of the 1960s that do in fact offer warnings for today			1
@entity58 once said that history does not repeat itself , but it rhymes			0
most of those who have compared @entity28 to @entity5 do not say that the situations were exactly the same politically or strategically			1
nor is it inevitable that the surge in @entity28 will be unsuccessful			1
the point of the comparison is that it is impossible to ignore the fact that @entity22 faces similar challenges , as did @entity1 when the " @entity70 " of @entity5 began in the spring of 1965			1
both presidents entered the war despite the fact that many top advisers in the @entity75 and in @entity76 were strongly warning against escalation			0
in 1964 , @entity1 heard from voices ranging from @entity80 liberal @entity79 to @entity82 hawk @entity81 that @entity5 was not critical to fighting communism and that the war was unwinnable			1
their warnings proved to be accurate			0
going into this decision , @entity22 heard comparable criticism as well			1
both presidents also expanded the war just as they were trying to shape a broad domestic agenda			0
@entity1 was much further ahead of the game when he increased the number of ground troops in the war that he inherited			0
the war devastated @entity1 's domestic efforts			0
@entity22 faces the same threat			1
both wars have been justified as wars of necessity			0
with @entity5 , proponents warned that the fall of @entity104 to communism would vastly strengthen the @entity106 and @entity107			1
in an era when @entity34 schoolchildren were being taught to duck and cover under their desks in case of nuclear war , this warning about @entity5 also made the war seem essential			1
today , the necessity stems from the claim that failure would resurrect the dangers we faced before 9/11			0
and both presidents escalated wars where the path to victory and the potential costs -- in terms of human capital and budgetary obligations -- were unclear			0
despite the fact that @entity1 confronted a very different kind of enemy , the risk today is enormously high			0
in @entity28 , the @entity34 is dealing with a war front that is notoriously treacherous , as the @entity106 learned in the 1980s and the @entity34 has learned since 2001			2
the @entity34 is also depending on a highly corrupt and undependable government in @entity28			2
while the promise of withdrawal in july 2011 might be accurate , presidential assurances of benchmarks and end games historically do n't come true			0
the one constant in warfare is that it is unpredictable and difficult to control			0
one day after @entity22 's speech , defense secretary @entity143 indicated that the deadline was not firm			2
and the administration might very well be handcuffing itself to a strategy of more warfare as it keeps offering grave warnings about what a victory by the @entity151 would mean			0
these warnings will make it difficult in the long run for the administration to contain the operation or to withdraw forces unless it is absolutely clear that the @entity151 has been defeated			0
democrats could find themselves feeling like their predecessors in the 1950s who were under political pressure to abide by the containment arguments outlined by president @entity166 with the @entity167 in 1947 -- first with @entity168 in 1950 and then with @entity5			2
@entity22 should not be so defensive about the comparisons with @entity5			1
rather , he should use @entity1 's experience to help guide him as he makes crucial decisions in the months ahead and attempts to navigate the challenges of the wartime presidency			2
in a conversation with a few of his closest advisers , @entity1 said in 1964 that " it 's damned easy to get in a war but it 's gon na be awfully hard to ever extricate yourself if you get in			0
" in 1965 , @entity1 made the mistake of excluding those who were trying to warn him about the dangers of the war			0
let 's hope that this time around @entity22 does not repeat this error			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 .			2

@entity190 : some @entity5 - @entity28 comparisons have merit
it is impossible to ignore the challenges @entity22 faces in @entity28 , he says
@entity190 : @entity22 should use lessons of @entity5 as a guide
