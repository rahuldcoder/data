-- the @entity2 bombings shook the nation			1
with one suspect killed and the other captured friday night , there are far more questions than answers at this point			0
while authorities unravel details in the coming days and weeks , many people are curious about @entity13 and its history , hoping to better understand the background of the two suspected bombers			1
the important thing to keep in mind right now is that 26 - year - old @entity19 had a green card , and 19 - year - old @entity21 became a naturalized @entity23 citizen in september 2012			0
assuming that their motives are related to their @entity27 origins would be like assuming that @entity29 's motives were related to his @entity32 / @entity31 origins			1
although the @entity21 brothers are of @entity27 ethnic background , they are from the neighboring republic of @entity37 -- a tremendously diverse region that differs from @entity13 in many ways			1
according to press reports , they fled @entity37 for distant @entity41 and @entity42 in @entity43 sometime before or during the second @entity27 war with @entity45 , which started in 1999 and spilled over into @entity37			1
it is likely that they found many @entity27 contacts in these new homes , which still have a @entity27 diaspora remaining from @entity52 's forced deportation of the @entity27 people to those republics in 1944			1
from @entity42 , they emigrated to the @entity23 in 2002			0
@entity13 is a small republic within the @entity45 of about a million people located in the @entity57 between the @entity59 and @entity60 seas			1
the @entity13 have a long history of intense conflict with @entity45			1
in fact , even after encircling the region through the conquest of @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 to the south in 1801 , it still took the mighty @entity45 army 60 more years to conquer the region			0
in 1944 , @entity73 dictator @entity52 accused the @entity13 of treason and deported every man , woman and child to locations scattered through @entity79 in a brutal action with high death rates			2
the deported @entity27 people were only allowed to return in 1957 , four years after @entity52 's death			1
it is quite likely that the grandparents or great - grandparents of the @entity87 suffered through these horrible actions			0
when the @entity73 collapsed in 1991 , 15 constituent republics became independent countries , but @entity13 was just an autonomous region within the @entity45 , and @entity45 president @entity91 refused to allow @entity13 to break free and form an independent state			2
in 1994 , he ordered the invasion of @entity13 to reverse its declaration of independence and to force the region back under @entity98 's control			1
the two - year war and the years that followed were filled with violence , chaos and lawlessness			0
estimates of @entity13 killed in the 1990s run as high as 100,000			2
@entity37 was for the most part able to avoid the violence of the 1990s and stayed relatively quiet			0
both @entity21 brothers most likely heard a lot about the second war between @entity45 and @entity13 that started in 1999 , a war that this time involved parts of @entity37 as well			2
this time , a radical @entity27 warlord named @entity113 tried to spread anti-russian unrest to the much larger neighboring region of @entity37			2
with a small army , he took several towns in @entity37 and a month later four residential apartments were blown up in @entity98 and two other @entity45 cities , killing and injuring hundreds			0
he found little support from the peoples of @entity37 and instead spurred newly appointed @entity45 prime minister @entity123 to launch a new war against @entity13			2
this round of fighting was even more brutal than the first war			0
extreme @entity27 groups turned to guerrilla warfare in the mountains , and horrific acts of terror in @entity45 , including the @entity134 elementary school siege that ended with 334 people dead , including 186 children			1
other acts included setting off bombs in the @entity98 subway system and taking an entire @entity98 theater hostage			0
both the @entity142 @entity27 leader @entity141 and his various @entity27 underground jihadist and nationalist opponents have denied any connection to the @entity146			2
the question of their links to any groups will be one of the most important questions for the investigation to come			0
in the past few years , both the @entity87 excelled in sports and academics , and seem to have lived apparently normal lives			0
it remains to be seen whether their life experiences , nationalist or religious ideas led them to the @entity2 bombings -- or if their motives were more akin to the domestic mass killers we have seen far too often in places like @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , and elsewhere			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			0

the two suspected bombers of the @entity2 are of @entity27 ethnic background
@entity172 : people are curious about @entity13 and want to know more about the suspects
he says @entity13 went through wars and chaos
@entity172 : it 's hard to tell whether their life experiences or other factors led them to their actions
