-- as the rest of the world waits to see if @entity5 can avert a nuclear catastrophe , a small band of experts is putting their lives at risk to prevent the disaster			1
thousands of people living near the troubled @entity12 nuclear power plant have been evacuated from their homes because of the risk of radiation leaks from reactors damaged by last week 's devastating earthquake and tsunami			1
but while most hurry in the opposite direction , about 180 plant workers are staying put -- despite the fact that doing so could result in serious illness or even death -- to battle the meltdown threat			1
" the workers at this site are involved in a heroic endeavor , " former @entity27 @entity29 @entity28 told @entity0			1
" there is at least fragmentary evidence that in some places on this site there are life - threatening doses of radiation			1
i think they are doing enormously heroic work			0
" the workers left at the site are said to be highly trained and experienced nuclear operators , engineers and safety staff with highly specialized knowledge			1
@entity46 , of the @entity47 at the @entity48 , said for many of them -- despite the highly unusual and potentially dangerous circumstances -- it will be just another day at the office			0
" they see it as doing their job , " he said			0
" the @entity5 in particular are dedicated to duty , and they will see it as their duty to do what they are doing			0
" according to the @entity64 , the average person is exposed to about 3.0 millisieverts ( msv ) a year of radiation , from naturally - occurring , medical and other sources			1
but monitoring at the @entity12 site has recorded radiation as high as 400 millisieverts an hour -- a level known to be a risk to human health			1
exposure to 1,000 millisieverts ( @entity74 ) of radiation can cause radiation sickness			2
" it is difficult to get a clear picture , but there have been spikes in radiation to enormous doses , high enough to risk radiation sickness , " said dr. @entity77 , a member of the organization @entity78			1
" these people are undergoing total body radiation , which can cause leukaemia and lymphoma as well as thyroid cancer later on , " he said			2
experts say lessons have been learned since the nuclear disaster at @entity94 25 years ago , when an unauthorized experiment saw radioactive dust spread across swathes of @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 and western @entity101			1
then , emergency workers were sent in with little or no protection to deal with the fallout			2
" it was pandemonium ; there was no monitoring , no idea of the risks , " @entity46 said			0
by contrast , he said , staff at @entity12 will be kitted out in protective clothing and breathing apparatus , they will be closely monitored and working in teams to limit their exposure to radiation			1
" if i were them i would be more worried about the hydrogen explosions , which have been huge -- enough to blow the roofs off two buildings -- and which i think are a much bigger risk to the workers on the ground , " he told @entity0			2
but dr. @entity77 said reports suggested that the operation was not going 100 % to plan , describing it as " something out of an adventure movie			0
" " we are in totally uncharted waters , people are ad - libbing to deal with the situation , " he said			0
" using fire trucks to pump a mixture of sea water and boron onto the reactors is not in any of the manuals			0
" @entity46 said the workers will have known they may one day face a risky situation such as this			2
however , @entity77 said that made them even braver , and their work more admirable			0
" these workers are trained to understand the risks , but that only makes it all the more heroic that they have agreed to stay and work to prevent a disaster , " he said			2
" they know that if there is a reactor meltdown it could be a major disaster affecting huge areas and massive numbers of people , and they are risking their lives to try and prevent that			1
all of us owe them a huge debt of gratitude			0
" professor @entity46 agreed : " they are heroic , there is no doubt about that -- it 's a pity that is n't recognised more			0
they are heroes , and i bow down to them			0

180 workers at @entity12 nuclear power plant trying to avert nuclear catastrophe
recorded radiation at levels high enough to pose a threat to human health
experts *praise* plant team as heroes , say they are risking their lives for the greater good
