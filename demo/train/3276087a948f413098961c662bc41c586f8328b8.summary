-- every year , thousands of families gather in school gymnasiums and auditoriums across the country to enter a drawing , one they believe will make the difference between success and struggle			1
these lotteries are how charter schools decide who their students will be ; the experience can be quite dramatic			1
as each name is revealed , many winning families ca n't help but cry out , relieved that they 've beaten the odds , convinced that great things are now in store for them			2
but just a few feet away from these joyful celebrations , there are tears			0
students -- some still in kindergarten -- sob with their parents as they realize their hopes have been dashed			0
these gut - wrenching scenes play out in " waiting for ' @entity28 ' " and " @entity29 , " two new documentaries that put a harsh spotlight on @entity33 's public education system and have sparked nationwide debate on what education solutions are needed			1
" i do n't even go to lotteries anymore because they break my heart , " @entity37 , @entity38 , mayor @entity39 said in " @entity29			0
" " a child 's destiny should not be determined on the pull of a draw			0
" but destiny is exactly what many parents believe is at stake			0
frustrated with failing public schools in their neighborhoods , they 've turned to a charter school that they hope will dramatically improve their child 's chances for success			1
space in these schools is limited , however , and by federal law , lotteries decide who gets in			0
" @entity29 , " directed by @entity66 , follows four elementary - age children from low - income neighborhoods in @entity65			0
their parents have applied for @entity68 , a highly regarded charter school where " about 95 percent of the kids are at grade level , " @entity66 said in an interview with @entity0			2
" in @entity73 overall ... it 's 56 percent			0
" " waiting for ' @entity28 , ' " directed by @entity74 , takes a national approach , following children applying for charter schools in @entity65 , @entity78 and @entity79			1
both films reach the same consensus : the @entity33 public education system is antiquated and needs to be revamped			1
" by getting to know these children -- and the mothers and fathers who are fighting for them -- then maybe people will be outraged enough to demand real change in their own neighborhoods , " said @entity74 , who also directed the @entity84 - winning documentary " @entity85			0
" " the idea of education reform becomes a lot less abstract and a lot more compelling when you see these beautiful kids and realize all their potential			0
" both " @entity29 " and " @entity28 " use successful charter schools to illustrate that all children can learn as long as they 're in the right environment			1
charter schools are similar to public schools in that they are free to attend and funded by taxpayer dollars			1
but unlike public schools , they are not bound to the rules and regulations of a district , state or teachers union			1
they are free to set their own guidelines for curriculum , teacher evaluations and lengths of school days			2
in return for this autonomy , the schools must live up to a contract , or charter , signed with the governing authority in their state			2
if the schools fail to reach required goals set in the charter , which are usually three to five years in length , they can be closed down			2
charter school proponents say increased accountability -- as well as the freedom to innovate -- gives them an edge over traditional public schools			1
since 1991 , 40 states , as well as the @entity79 and @entity139 , have signed legislation that allows charter schools			1
while " @entity29 " and " @entity28 " celebrate charter schools and hold up their leaders as shining examples of positive reform , the films are highly critical of politically powerful teachers unions , saying their unwillingness to change is largely responsible for hindering progress in @entity33 's public education system			1
both films detail how difficult it is to fire a tenured teacher for poor performance			0
" @entity29 " said that of 55,000 tenured teachers in @entity65 , 10 were fired in 2007			0
the cost to do so ? about $ 250,000 each			0
" the system is really built for the harmony amongst adults , " @entity74 told @entity0			0
" that means that the teachers unions , the central bureaucracies and the administrators , they 've got job security , and everything is working just fine			0
we need to reorient our schools so that they serve the kids			0
" @entity170 , president of one of the country 's two largest teachers unions , appeared in both films and said they are n't without merit			2
" they connect us to real - life struggles			0
they may even call much - needed attention to the challenges confronting many students and schools , " said @entity170 , who leads the @entity179			0
" but the attention will be misplaced if it centers on off - base solutions and denigrating good teachers rather than on what works to improve our schools			1
" @entity170 thinks " @entity28 , " in particular , was " inaccurate , inconsistent and incomplete " despite its " unquestionably good intentions			1
" " there also are countless good , great and exceptional teachers working in our public schools every day in neighborhoods across the country -- although for this film , they apparently ended up on the cutting - room floor , " she said			1
@entity170 also said the film 's charter school success stories are not representative of charter schools as a whole : " @entity204 makes only glancing reference to the poor achievement of most charter schools , despite the abundance of independent research showing that most charter schools perform worse than or only about as well as comparable regular public schools			1
" one report , released last year by the @entity213 at @entity214 , looked at 70 percent of the nation 's charter school students and compared their progress with similar students in nearby public schools			1
it found that 17 percent of charter schools reported progress significantly better than public schools , 46 percent showed no difference , and 37 percent performed worse			1
whatever the answer to @entity33 's education troubles , @entity74 said , his ultimate goal is to get people talking and motivate them to take action			2
the film 's website offers detailed instructions of how people can make a difference on a local level -- from writing public officials to volunteering at schools in their own communities			2
" the option of just sticking your head in the sand , praying for some @entity28 to come in and save your schools , it ai n't going to work , " he said .			2

two films , " the lottery " and " waiting for ' @entity28 , ' " take on the @entity33 education system
both highlight successful charter schools and lengths families go to enroll
critics say the films ignore good public school teachers and charter schools ' *shortcomings*
