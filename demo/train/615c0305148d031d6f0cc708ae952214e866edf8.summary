@entity3 , @entity2 themselves to a core group of caucus - goers roughly one year before the contest			1
immigration and @entity15 extremism took front and center as the @entity19 hopefuls sought to test - drive their stump speeches			1
on style , it was @entity24 gov. @entity23 and @entity26 sen. @entity25 who saw strong receptions from the audience , though support for a wide number of candidates was expressed in the hallways after the event			1
@entity35 gov. @entity34 also sought to establish a deeper bond with @entity2			1
the @entity2 receives outsized attention in presidential years thanks to its first - in - the - nation status during the primary season			1
@entity41 time for the 10 - hour day of back - to - back speeches , " the candidates " -- as they were called -- joined other high - profile @entity1 at @entity43 , an old , intricate theater built in 1877 that also became the first public art museum in @entity3			2
billed as the @entity48 , the event was co-hosted by @entity49 and rep. @entity50 , a revered lawmaker who represents the northwestern part of the state and has considerable clout among the more social conservative and @entity56 right faction of the party			2
it was no secret that it was considered a cattle call for the presidential race			1
former @entity63 gov. @entity62 , for example , said that the reason he ended his @entity66 show was for a bigger goal he has in mind			2
" it was n't just so i can go deer hunting every weekend , i can assure you that , " he said			2
" i am a potential presidential candidate , yes i am , " former @entity74 ceo @entity73 told @entity4			1
even @entity75 angled to get in on some of the action , teasing ahead of her appearance saturday that she was now seriously considering a run			2
and real estate titan @entity79 told reporters saturday that he 'll make his decision before june			2
" i 'm the one person who can make this country great again , that 's all i know , " he told reporters saturday			2
" @entity75 , in her remarks , was less forward			2
ticking through a somewhat dizzying and hard - to - follow speech , @entity75 suggested that the country is ready for a woman leader -- just not @entity91			2
" hey @entity2 , can anyone stop @entity91 ? " she said , prompting the audience to cheer			1
" to borrow a phrase , yes we can ! " the class of 2016 the speakers , who were typically allotted 20 minutes , used a bulk of their speeches to share their own personal upbringings			1
@entity101 and @entity34 talked about their strict but sharp mothers , while @entity24 gov. @entity23 and @entity26 sen. @entity25 talked about having pastors as fathers			1
other more well - known names in @entity2 — like former @entity107 sen. @entity106 who won the state 's caucuses in 2012 and @entity62 , who won in 2008 — tried to remind @entity110 why they picked them in the first place , dipping into their personalities but also focusing on the issues			1
given @entity50 's firebrand credentials as an outspoken opponent of illegal immigration , it was no surprise that problems at the border became a focal point in much of the speeches saturday			1
@entity101 , a retired neurosurgeon , argued " there would n't be people coming in here if there was n't a magnet pulling them in , " suggesting there should be criminal punishment for employers who hire undocumented workers			2
the main target in the immigration battle , however , was president @entity136 's executive action to delay deportation for up to five million undocumented immigrants			1
or as @entity75 put it , in her folksy swagger , @entity136 's decision makes him seem " like an overgrown little boy who 's just acting kinda spoiled			2
" speakers railed against the president 's pledge to use his " pen and his phone " to work around @entity147 , with immigration as just one example of what many called the president 's " overreach			1
" that was punctuated when @entity157 protesters interrupted @entity159 's speech , leading to one arrest and theater full of @entity110 trying to drown out the demonstrators ' chants			0
the potential candidates also warned about what they see as a dire path for the country , in particular when it comes to foreign policy , a theme that , along with immigration , also seems poised to become a flash point in the 2016 presidential race , unlike in 2012			1
@entity106 argued that the growth of @entity175 is a consequence of the " isolationism " and " weakness " from the @entity136 's administration			0
@entity25 , like several speakers , said the president will fail in the war on terror if he refuses to use the words " radical islamic terrorism			1
" @entity62 blasted @entity136 for devoting more time to climate change in the @entity187 than talking about terrorism			2
" a beheading is a far greater threat to @entity191 than a sunburn , " @entity62 said			0
the issues there was plenty of the usual @entity2 charm on stage , speeches with pig analogies and corn references			1
and there was more than one reference to how people in @entity2 are somehow taller than average			1
shown on a big screen above the stage was an image of a red barn sitting on a green hill surrounded by white fences			0
@entity50 's name — in all caps — was plastered across banners on the stage , as well as the podium			0
the contenders also dished out a bevy of red meat , blasting @entity219 , @entity220 , the media , @entity91 and the $ 18 trillion debt			0
@entity25 won huge applause for proposing to place 110,000 @entity225 employees on the southern border , joking that they 'll do a better job at deterring illegal immigration than anything else			1
giving a shout out to the state 's newly elected @entity191 senator , @entity232 , was also a popular item on the agenda for the potential candidates			0
nearly all of them referred to her as their " friend , " and almost equal amount of affection and time was dedicated to the state 's other beloved senator , @entity244			0
@entity23 , who , like @entity25 , paced the stage back and forth as he spoke , delivered an impressive speech that honed in on his record as governor			1
he talked about implementing voter id laws , and he painted himself as the valiant warrior who took on the public employees and won during the collective bargaining rights debate of 2011			0
he also did n't forget to mention that he 's been elected three times in the past four years			0
shortly after his speech , two men , both from @entity256 , talked outside about how they were wowed by @entity23 's remarks			1
" if he could do on a nationwide scale what he did in @entity24 , this country would be , " one man , @entity259 , started to say , before his friend , @entity260 , interjected : " transformed			0
the country would be transformed			0
" the reception many attendees had a hard time picking just one favorite in the line of potential contenders			0
several mentioned @entity73 as a surprise hit			0
" there was just a pantheon of people to listen to , " said @entity272 of @entity273			0
" @entity159 was better than last time i heard him — that 's good			0
he needs it , " said @entity280 of @entity281 , @entity2			1
@entity34 also saw a warm reception and contested the idea that a @entity1 governor of a blue state who has a " @entity35 guy " reputation will not connect with voters in @entity2			1
" that somehow i 'm too loud , i 'm too blunt and i 'm too direct , " @entity34 said , dismissing the criticism as " conventional wisdom " from @entity294 pundits			0
" still , he was noticeably different from his usual style			0
his demeanor was toned down and he read from his prepared remarks on the podium , a stark contrast to his preferred off - the - cuff method			0
some of the chatter in the hallways and to reporters also featured two potential contenders who were n't there : @entity309 and @entity310			0
@entity79 put it simply : " @entity310 had his chance			0
he should have won and he choked			0
" as for @entity309 : " we 've had enough of the @entity314			0
" sens. @entity315 and @entity317 , as well as gov. @entity318 , also skipped the event , but given that it 's year ahead before @entity110 start to caucus , it 's unlikely that missing one event will hurt them			0
saturday 's event was more of a curtain raiser , giving the first glimpse of what will likely be a competitive @entity1 primary			2
@entity23 , as he closed his speech , offered a pledge that will likely be mirrored by several of the speakers on stage over the next year : " i 'm going to come back many more times			1
" @entity4 's @entity332 contributed to this report .			0
