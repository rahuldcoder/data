@entity0 -- the banners hanging on @entity4 street corners boast of the " @entity5 " with the @entity6 , and the @entity7 is flying side by side with the @entity10 all across @entity0			1
it is a proud moment for the host nation			0
but as president @entity14 heads to @entity4 and the @entity15 for the first time since moving into the @entity17 , there is no expectation of any significant policy breakthroughs and countless questions about his frosty relationship with @entity4 prime minister @entity22			1
" it is the most dysfunctional relationship in the history of @entity6 - @entity4 relations , " former @entity6 @entity24 negotiator @entity23 told @entity1			1
" there is no real sense of confidence or trust			0
there is no capacity to give the other the benefit of the doubt			0
" @entity23 : @entity14 's @entity4 trip about legacy and yet , @entity23 sees a chance that this meeting , on @entity22 's turf , could at least usher in a period of greater cooperation if not personal warmth			1
" i think both have decided for different reasons that it is time to test the proposition that they can work together			0
" the prime minister clearly supported @entity14 's @entity52 opponent , @entity51 , in last year 's @entity6 election , and he has made clear at times he does not think the @entity6 president understands @entity4 's security challenges			1
@entity14 , in turn , was recorded on an open microphone bemoaning having to deal with @entity22			1
and the @entity17 has compiled a list of what it sees as slights by the @entity22 government , including issuing permits for settlement building during a visit here by vice president @entity67			1
and yet , the crowded and messy issues agenda , and the fact the two leaders need each other both for policy and domestic political reasons , is why some like @entity23 see the possibility of a more cooperative relationship			0
@entity14 , said @entity23 , " does n't want to be the @entity6 president on whose watch @entity77 either gets the bomb or he needs to bomb			1
and he does n't want to be the @entity6 president on whose watch the two - state solution formally expires			1
" on eve of @entity4 trip , @entity14 tells @entity77 to disarm an eye on history @entity22 is perhaps chastened a bit by his own recent elections , just now forming a new coalition that nudged his government somewhat to the left			1
not to mention a concern he shares with @entity14 : an eye on history			1
" the clock is running down for both of these guys , " said @entity23 , a former @entity95 @entity24 hand			0
" he ( @entity22 ) wants to be viewed as the prime minister who did something and not a do - nothing leader			1
i think that combined with the likelihood the new @entity4 government is a tad more pragmatic than the first @entity22 government suggest there are some broad areas for cooperation			1
" ambassador : trip shows @entity14 's ties with @entity4 a look at the regional map gives a better perspective of the messy state of the neighborhood and the urgency of the @entity14 - @entity22 meeting			1
the major topics : @entity77 : @entity14 made clear in recent days he believes he has a year or so before @entity77 reaches the tipping point in its nuclear program , and he comes to @entity4 to make the case @entity22 needs to give diplomacy more time			1
while skeptical there can be a negotiated solution , @entity4 officials say @entity22 is open to months of additional diplomacy but hopes to get a firmer commitment from @entity14 on when the @entity6 would shift to military options			1
@entity132 : @entity4 is a critical source of intelligence to the @entity6 about developments within @entity132 , including movement of regime military assets			1
while long on record , even before the @entity14 @entity17 , in saying it was time for @entity141 's regime to yield power , the rise of the @entity144 in @entity145 has @entity4 nervous about possible regime change in @entity132			1
still , the @entity14 administration is now saying it would not discourage allies from doing more to help the @entity132 opposition			2
weapons movement in @entity132 an issue as @entity14 visits @entity4 the @entity4 - @entity153 dispute : @entity17 officials say @entity14 is not carrying a new peace initiative and is hardly optimistic there is solid ground to try to revive negotiations			1
most of all , the president 's aides say , he wants to assess how prepared , if at all , @entity22 and @entity153 leader @entity161 are to return to negotiations			1
because the prospects for that are considered so low , the dispute that often has dominated any @entity6 presidential visit to the region is now almost a back - burner issue			2
" i know the president really believes that @entity174 - @entity4 peace is important to @entity6 , " said @entity169 , a @entity24 scholar who leads the @entity171 's @entity170			1
" although i am not sure he fully understands what that means in terms of commitment			0
" visits to @entity181 , @entity182 and several @entity4 settlements in the @entity15 in recent days bring constant evidence that tensions are increasing again , including some rock attacks on settlers on roads that run between @entity4 and @entity153 neighborhoods			1
@entity190 , a @entity153 political organizer , said during a weekend conversation in @entity181 that he constantly preaches nonviolent demonstrations as the best way to air grievances and put pressure on @entity153 leaders and get the attention of @entity14			2
@entity190 argues @entity22 would benefit politically from any @entity153 violence			2
but he says he senses growing frustration and worries his advice may not always be heeded			0
wanted : more action , fewer words " at the beginning there was hope for him , " he said of the @entity6 president			2
" but it was just words , and @entity153 are tired of more words			0
" nonviolent resistance key to @entity24 breakthrough @entity153 want @entity14 to prove there are consequences if his call for an @entity4 settlement freeze is again ignored -- as it is being ignored at this very moment with construction of subdivisions			1
and their grievances are evident in more personal ways : posters on @entity181 streets sarcastically advise @entity14 not to bring his smartphone because @entity4 does not allow 3g or better service in the @entity153 territories			1
the nagging sense of rising tensions can be heard in the form of gunfire a short drive from @entity181 in an industrial area tucked between @entity4 settlements			2
up one dusty road , the @entity236 security training academy is tucked into the hillside			0
inside , there are several ranges where students fire live ammunition , as well as indoor gymnasium space for hand - to - hand combat training			2
among the students as we visited : residents of a local @entity4 settlement who are part of its security structure , and a half dozen men being trained for anti-terrorism patrols on the light rail system that runs through @entity0			2
the academy is run by @entity256 , a colonel in the @entity4 reserves , who says beyond teaching students good marksmanship , he has to disabuse them of any complacency			2
" our enemies are very motivated to do attacks on us in the cities and in the settlements , wherever there are @entity267 , " @entity256 told us			0
" we are not waiting for the suicide bomber to come			0
we want to be prepared			0
" conversations at @entity236 and in two of the nearby settlements eerily mirror those we had in @entity181 and @entity182 : a nagging sense from people who have lived here a long time that tensions are building toward more violence			0
" the security guards are preparing for attacks , and not for attacks from the @entity182 , " @entity256 said			0
laying the groundwork for progress later while not carrying a dramatic new peace plan , @entity17 officials say @entity14 hopes his conversation on this trip begins to lay the groundwork for progress not too far down the road			2
given the mistrust , scholar @entity169 said he worries about potential violence and a frustrated @entity153 political leadership			0
" they want something concrete , " @entity169 said			0
" they need a game - changer			0
they need a paradigm - changer			0
the president is not going to offer that on this trip			2
" instead , @entity169 said , as long as there is follow - through , he could understand the president 's longer - term horizon			2
" i think that 's the way they have to approach it -- looking ahead , not just looking at what you are going to get out of this trip per se , " @entity169 said			0
but @entity256 says he sees no hope for a major breakthrough , in the short or longer term			0
" i remember my mother said , ' i hope you do n't have to go through the army			0
' i told her always , since i was a child , i told her i do n't think that will true			0
and i 'm not telling that to my kids			0
i 'm telling them , ' listen guys : these are the facts -- you live in @entity4			2
you probably will have to go in the army			0
