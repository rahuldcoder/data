-- " admit it , you 're lonely			1
in the end , whatever you say , you must be so lonely			2
" so said the otherwise obliging radio presenter when he interviewed me about a recent @entity9 article in which i had defended singledom			2
read more : @entity11 ? you 're not alone after so often being asked at dinner parties or other social occasions , why i was not partnered , i had realized that the question is innately hostile			1
if i were to ask a similar question , " why have you settled for him ? " or " how did you get stuck with her ? are you so afraid of being alone ? " this would be thought rude and intrusive			1
read more : still single ? what 's the matter with you ? increasingly , we realize our relationships might not or need not endure			1
increasingly , we are choosing to live alone			0
and yet being or remaining single still is still too often considered a deviant status , a second best , a failing			1
we do n't need stories of how to become couples			1
we need stories about how to be single			1
we need them whether we are gay or straight			0
we need them whether we are single by choice , through separation , divorce , or bereavement or because this , for you , is how life has turned out			1
read more : the stigma of being single in @entity43 i did not claim the single state to be superior to coupledom -- nor ever will -- but that it is equally valid , as capable of joy , variety , adventure and eventfulness			1
and , yes , as liable to loneliness -- with the proviso that no one is quite as lonely as those who fear being alone			1
and why would n't we fear being alone ? are n't we encouraged in this fear ? every pop song has it so			1
every movie touching on human relationships			0
every advert selling us not just the better life , but the best life			0
your family fear for you			0
sometimes you might frighten yourself			0
you are nothing , nothing , nothing if you do n't have someone else to complete you ? and who would want to remain a spinster ? ugly word			1
the word is innocent : the connotations are unkind			0
does n't it suggest that , withered , alone and childless , you have failed at life ? rebrand the word			2
call yourself @entity76 ! say it like @entity78 ! fight for your rights -- or simply vote , as 68 % of single women did for one candidate over another , and let it be understood that your interests are not in the economy , but your own sex life and your need for free birth control			1

a single person is sexless , celibate , repressed -- or the very reverse			1
historically , the bachelor has had an easier time of it , but who calls himself a bachelor these days ? does n't it sound suspect ? perhaps these male spinsters have " issues " ? are n't lying about their sexuality ? are n't they emotionally retarded ? might they be users , fearful of real commitment ? they will be punished			1
they do not know how lonely they will become			0
even the gay bachelor can no longer escape			0
that gay relationships need protection of the law is both right and necessary , but why is the true confirmation of our sexuality to be in thrall to the tyranny of coupledom that for so long did us so little favor ? people have told me that i have been brave to speak out as a single person			1
it did not seem so			0
it seemed timely and necessary			0
it seems right to keep on saying so			0
but , yes , i must be lonely , must n't i ? despite all i believe and say , i must be lying to myself			2
i must realize i am failing at life			0
read more : @entity127 's blog so , more or less , thought a therapist on that radio show			1
much of his work was with single people			2
there can be no other kind			0
they sit alone in bars -- or , at least , the men do : the women dare not go out at night			2
he counseled such people , and he had discovered that each had sustained a psychic wound in childhood			0
he led them to a point where they realized that only union with another person could heal that wound			0
he did not know me -- he did not know me at all -- but he suspected this was my story , this was my life , and how it and i might be healed			2
i told him that i did not spend my time alone at bars , that i had , as single people do , friends			2
i had relationships , that my life was full			0
i told him that i was no more wounded than any coupled person , and that i looked with horror at any advice that led me to use another person as a band - aid			0
i can not deny that i am sometime sorrowful , sometime lonely			0
simply being human , single or coupled , means one has , running though oneself , a vein of sorrow , but i wonder , when the coupled person considers that vein of sorrow within themselves if they are not tempted to call it , i do n't know , " my husband " ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity127 .			1

as single man , @entity127 often faces " innately hostile " question : why are you single ?
he asks : " @entity177 is confirmation of sexuality to be in thrall to tyranny of coupledom ? "
he does n't claim single state to be superior to coupledom -- but it is equally valid
