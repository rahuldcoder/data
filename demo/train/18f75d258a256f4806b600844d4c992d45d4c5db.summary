-- for the first time ever , pioneering @entity2 reality series " @entity3 " is changing its format			1
after 21 years and 28 seasons , " @entity3 " is shaking things up with a twist and name change for its upcoming edition , which has the show returning to @entity12			1
arguably tv 's second longest - running reality show ( the first would be " @entity15 , " which launched in 1989 ) , " @entity3 " will be re-titled " @entity3 : @entity16 " when it airs next year			1
the season begins like any other : seven young , attractive and single diverse castmates from around the country move into a house			1
they 'll start to form bonds , with each other and with @entity12 locals			1
then , one month into the three - month shoot , they 'll go away for a day trip			1
when they return , they 're in for a huge shock : their exes have moved in too			1
@entity34 's new survival series : ' dude , you 're screwed ! ' @entity36 , who co-created the series with @entity39 - @entity38 , notes the show 's diverse - mix - of - strangers - in - a - house format is n't quite as earth - shattering of a format these days			1
many reality shows — from @entity52 's " @entity51 " to @entity46 ' " @entity45 " — use bunking together as merely one component of the show 's drama			0
" when ' @entity3 ' went on the air in ' 92 , you put seven diverse people together and you get conflict , and out of that conflict would come change , and then you have a story , " @entity36 says			1
" now that it 's 21 years or so later , maybe we 're a bit of a victim of our own success			0
diversity is a fact of life today			0
a lot of young people date people of different races , or have friends who are gay			0
we 've had conversations [ with the network ] throughout 28 seasons of the show , but we 've never made this big of a commitment to change			0
" there was also the issue of the show 's ratings			0
" @entity3 " has proved incredibly durable considering how much the reality genre has evolved , and how many reality shows have come and gone on @entity2 — the network has always prided itself on trying to find the next bright and trend - setting idea			1
yet @entity2 has gone from ordering two " @entity90 " a year down to one as the show 's numbers have fallen — the most recent season averaged 1.5 million viewers			1
@entity2 and @entity36 hope the new format will make the show appointment viewing once again			1
the @entity96 twist has been done in reality tv before ( @entity45 's " @entity99 " twist in 2003 ) , but @entity36 suggests the idea came about in a more organic way			0
" when we cast people we usually always try to cast single people , " he said			0
" and they 'd say they were single during the casting process			0
then the moment they arrived at the house suddenly their ex was back in their life			0
i do n't know if it 's a safety blanket or that we 're never really done with our exes			2
when you talk about the age of our cast , their ex is often their first love — they play a huge role in their life			0
" @entity127 to launch new @entity129 fashion series when casting season 29 , producers sought singles who had particularly interesting relationships with their exes — there 's the person who 's really close friends with the ex , the one that 's always getting texts from his ex , etc. after filming began , producers had to scramble to convince the exes to drop everything and join the cast too — five of the seven agreed			1
" four weeks into the show , after some [ housemates ] started to develop new relationships , the exes come in — thus , @entity16 , " @entity36 said			2
" then it got really complicated and really interesting			0
i 'm still shocked we were able to pull it off			0
" " we wanted to give our audience a fresh take on the series , " added @entity157 , president of programming , @entity2			0
" we are excited about this season 's twists and unexpected turns			2
" now that the format has changed , a move that acknowledges the show 's own need to evolve , one must wonder : can " @entity3 " ever go back ? @entity36 says the brainstorming sessions that led to " ex-plosion " inspired many other potential twists as well			1
" we always approach it one season at a time			1
we will get this show on the air , see how people react and then decide			2
we had probably 10 good ideas for the season			2
maybe there will be another good idea for season 30			2
" @entity52 orders comedy pilot from ' @entity185 ' star @entity184 in another twist , the housemates were given smartphones for the first time , for posting messages and photos throughout their experience in the house			2
during filming , the messages and photos were only viewable on a closed system viewable by the housemates , their friends and family ( and their exes , of course )			2
the banked content will be gradually rolled out publicly once the show starts airing sometime next year			2
and what about the hot tub ? does " @entity3 " still have a hot tub in the house for the new season or has that changed too ? @entity36 pauses at the question			1
" of course there 's a hot tub			0
