-- it 's a bit like train - spotting but rather more serious			2
on october 10 , @entity5 - watchers pored over live televised coverage of a massive military parade in @entity8 , held to mark the 65th anniversary of @entity5 's ruling party			1
just like the @entity13 parades of yore , it was a chance to see what military hardware the @entity15 might be showing off			1
the official news agency said the parade showed " the will and might of @entity20 to wipe out the enemy			2
" the hardware was accompanied by slogans such as " defeat the @entity24			2
@entity26 soldiers are the @entity28 's enemy			2
" and besides the incredible synchronized goose - stepping , there were tanks and new missiles			0
analysts paid special attention to the first public appearance of a road - mobile ballistic missile with a projected range of between 3,000 and 4,000 kilometers ( roughly 1,900 to 2,400 miles ) , though reports of its existence had circulated for several years			1
there was also a new version of the no - dong ballistic missile , with a tri-conic nosecone , on show			1
that led @entity47 and others to observe design similarities to @entity52 's @entity51 missiles , suggesting further military cooperation between the two governments			1
@entity5 's nuclear capability and ballistic missile technology are its trump card , to make up for its aging conventional forces and as a bargaining chip in negotiations			1
so that 's what receives the bulk of funding and expertise			2
but despite economic stagnation , technological limitations and international sanctions , its conventional forces ca n't be discounted , if only because of their size			0
according to @entity73 analysts , the @entity15 scraped together what little foreign exchange it had to buy $ 65 million of weapons from @entity76 , @entity77 and eastern @entity78 between 2002 and 2008			1
one example : it appears to have bought @entity76 - made @entity82 anti-personnel lasers , using one to " illuminate " two @entity85 @entity84 helicopters flying along the southern side of the @entity87 in 2003			0
none of the crew members was injured			0
@entity76 says it continues to be open to military collaboration with @entity8 and last month welcomed a senior @entity5 official to @entity92 to " enhance coordination of the two militaries			1
" @entity76 is thought to have supplied the @entity15 with multiple rocket launchers and spare parts for planes , among other equipment			0
@entity8 has also turned to @entity52 and @entity99 for military transfers			0
much of the @entity15 's hardware is locally built using @entity76 and @entity77 templates			1
it has begun deploying a new tank , called the @entity105 ( @entity106 ) , which is modeled on the @entity77 t - 62 tank but hardly a match for modern @entity26 battle tanks			0
it 's not clear how many of these are in service , but @entity115 's @entity114 editor @entity113 says it is thought that only a few have been delivered -- and they lack devices like thermal imaging sights			0
also on show at the october parade : a new surface - to - air missile similar to a @entity76 model			1
@entity115 's concluded that it represented " a major expansion in @entity5 's air defense potential , " with a radar / guidance system that would be harder to jam			1
and although little is known about the size and scope of the @entity15 's artillery , the barrage fired this week at @entity131 suggests that it ca n't be ignored			0
the @entity5 regime has also devoted great resources to developing its navy , not with battleships but fast - attack vessels and an array of submarines			1
@entity115 's estimates that it has more than 400 surface vessels			0
and it is not hesitant to use its maritime forces , as demonstrated by the sinking of the 1,200 - ton @entity73 corvette @entity146 by a torpedo in march			1
but in a confrontation , the @entity73 navy is likely to come off best , as happened in a firefight in 1999			2
the main weakness of the @entity15 's military is a chronic shortage of computers , modern command and control and electronic warfare assets -- in other words , much of what makes up the 21st - century battlefield			2
at the same time , @entity73 has used its economic strength to modernize its armed forces : for example , building three $ 1 billion @entity165 - class destroyers to counter ballistic missiles			1
the same applies in the air			0
@entity5 's air force largely comprises aging @entity13 mig fighters ( though it has some @entity171 ) that would be unable to compete with @entity73 f - 15 jets or the @entity174 fighters of the @entity26 7th @entity175 , based in @entity73			1
in addition , the @entity15 's air force has suffered fuel shortages , and @entity115 's estimated that the @entity15 's fighter pilots may get as little as 25 flying hours per year			0
the @entity5 also have a large fleet of @entity77 - design biplanes that would be better suited to crop - spraying but could be used to drop special forces behind enemy lines in the event of conflict			2
to compensate for obsolescence , the @entity15 deploys boots on the ground in great numbers			0
@entity115 's estimates that its standing army numbers just over 1 million personnel , with reserves estimated at more than 7 million			0
but @entity5 soldiers are poorly fed , according to analysts and reports from defectors , and rarely train due to scarcity of fuel and ammunition despite the size of its armed forces , few analysts expect that the regime in the @entity15 would want to launch a general assault on the @entity73 , knowing that it would probably be repulsed and that in turn would imperil the regime			1
it might also ignite dissent			0
" with the ongoing leadership transition in @entity5 , there have been rumors of discontent within the military , and the current actions may reflect miscommunications or worse within the @entity15 's command - and - control structure , " geopolitical risk analysis firm @entity212 says			1
there is another practical reason why a land invasion would be difficult			0
@entity73 has built an array of obstructions on roads from the @entity15 that would force an invader 's tanks off the pavement and into rice fields			1
only in the winter would those fields be hard enough to allow the tanks to cross them			0
short of a general assault , the @entity15 clearly has enough in its arsenal to cause damage and death to its adversary , as the torpedo attack in march and the barrage this week have shown			1
and it has thousands of artillery pieces close to the @entity87 , which is just 30 kilometers ( 18 miles ) from @entity243			0
recent events show that it is also quite ready to exploit the element of surprise			2
there remains the great unanswered question about intentions			0
there 's plenty of what one expert calls " echo chamber analysis			0
" but as former president @entity258 wrote with a hint of understatement in the @entity261 on wednesday : " no one can completely understand the motivations of the @entity5			2

a massive military parade in october gave a rare window on @entity5 's hardware
its nuclear capability and ballistic missile technology are its trump card
most analysts doubt @entity5 would want to launch a direct assault on the @entity73
but recent developments show it has enough in its arsenal to cause damage and death
