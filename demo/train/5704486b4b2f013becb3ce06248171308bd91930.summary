i do n't know why he said it			0
author @entity6 's latest book , " epilogue : a memoir , " will be released in paperback this fall			1
i do n't know if a shadow had fallen across him , something appalling he saw out of the corner of his eye			0
i do n't know if it was just coincidence or intuition that prompted him , but about a week before my seemingly healthy 82 - year - old husband suddenly died , he emerged from the kitchen ready to go to his office , his face clean - shaven , his eyes shining , smiling shyly , holding the copy of the @entity26 book he was rereading , and said to me , " you have made me very happy			1
you know that you have made me a happy man			1
" there i stood in my work outfit , blue jeans and a t - shirt			0
there i stood with my white hair and my wrinkles and the face i was born with , although now much creased by time , and i felt beautiful			1
tell us what makes you feel beautiful " what ? " i said			1

" say it again , " i said			0
" you 've made me happy			1

perhaps not to the young man holding his toddler in his arms who rode the elevator with me ; perhaps not to the friend i met for lunch , a true believer in @entity76 ; perhaps not to passersby on the street ; but i knew it for a certainty			2
@entity0 : how to change things for the better i do n't believe that inner beauty is sufficient in this cruel world			2
that 's the pap one tells a child			2
i do n't believe that positive thinking improves your skin tone or that loving or being loved changes the shape of your nose or restores the thickness and color of hair , but i do know that there is a way of being beautiful , even as age takes its toll , that has something to do with the spirit filling with joy , something to do with the union with another human being , with the sense of having done well at something enormously important , like making happy a man who has made you happy often enough			1
ten days after that morning conversation , my husband and i returned from a concert and dinner with friends and walked down our windy block toward our apartment house when suddenly he stumbled and fell and died within minutes			1
as i waited for the ambulance , i remembered his words , a beauty potion i would take with me into the rest of my life			1
