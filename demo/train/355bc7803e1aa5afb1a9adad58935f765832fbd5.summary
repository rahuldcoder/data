@entity0 -- hopes that this weekend 's @entity4 election will deliver a major policy shift towards delivering higher growth and inflation have given the country 's financial markets a long - overdue shot in the arm			0
stock markets have rallied , up 10 % on the month to their highest levels since april			0
the yen , which was recently within touching distance of its post-war high , causing agony for @entity4 's manufacturers , has eased to eight - month lows			0
and @entity4 's long - term interest rates have fallen to their lowest levels since 2003			0
optimism hangs on the electoral rhetoric of @entity25 leader @entity24 , odds - on to be @entity4 's next prime minister			2
exasperated by @entity4 's two lost decades and persistent deflation , @entity24 has demanded aggressive action from @entity4 's central bank , calling for it to generate 2 % inflation and do whatever necessary -- including buying an " unlimited " amount of government bonds -- to hit that target			1
and harking back to days gone by , @entity24 has called for new budgetary stimulus too , including extra public works spending			1
but could an @entity24 - led government really snap @entity4 out of its seemingly interminable economic malaise ? of course , campaigning and governing are two very different things			1
and , given the perilous state of @entity4 's public finances , the next government will have precious little room for maneuver to boost public investment			0
dangerous waters : behind the islands dispute indeed , it will have countless unpalatable budgetary decisions to make , not least making the social security system affordable given @entity4 's rapidly aging population			0
so , in practice , fiscal policy is unlikely to be able to provide meaningful stimulus over the term of the next government			2
that means that the onus will be on monetary policy to boost growth and inflation			2
following rebuttals from present @entity67 governor @entity66 , @entity24 recently toned down his attacks on the central bank			1
but the @entity25 manifesto maintained @entity24 's commitment to a 2 % inflation target , with legislative action to be considered to force the @entity67 's hand if it does not co-operate			1
of course , whether an @entity25 - led government can amend laws related to the central bank , or will in large part depend on the election outcome			0
but even if @entity24 secures a comfortable majority in the @entity81 , given its lack of control of the @entity83 , it might struggle to secure the working majorities it will need in the diet to pass legislation comfortably			1
certainly , a government reliant on a number of parties to pass legislation may mean that complicated reforms to shake up the @entity67 are likely to remain more of a threat than a reality			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity96 .			0

former *pm* @entity24 is campaigning on joint monetary and fiscal stimulus to end persistent deflation
@entity24 has threatened legislative action if the @entity67 does *n't* commit to a 2 % inflation target
given *political* *constraints* , @entity24 is unlikely to secure the working majorities needed to pass such legislation , @entity96 writes
