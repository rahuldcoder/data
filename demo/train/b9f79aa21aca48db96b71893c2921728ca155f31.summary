-- years ago when i was a broke college student subsisting on ramen noodles and off - brand cereal , i used to fantasize that someday , when i had a good job , i would be able to afford to eat incredibly healthily			0
i planned to buy fresh vegetables every week , belong to a fabulous gym , employ a personal trainer and get regular massages			1
but today i still get sticker shock when i go to the grocery store			0
that 's why i was so skeptical when a @entity13 study released a few months ago asserted that healthy foods are actually cheaper than the heavily processed stuff			1
these findings are based on the fact that the old method prioritized price per calorie , giving low - cost junk food an edge over fresh veggies			1
but , the report said , " when measured on the basis of edible weight or average portion size , grains , vegetables , fruit , and dairy foods are less expensive than most protein foods and foods high in saturated fat , added sugars , and / or sodium			1
" translation : now there 's really no excuse not to eat healthier			0

similarly , gym memberships and personal trainers can be a big monthly expense , but they might be worth it if the only thing you 'd do at home with your treadmill or dumbbells is occasionally wipe the dust off of them			1
getting into shape -- and staying that way -- can save you some serious cash in the long run			1
lifestyle changes can help stave off diabetes as well as joint replacement and other big medical expenses			0
so , with those motivators in mind , here are few tips to help minimize the cash you spend on the road to being active and healthy : prioritize your monthly budget			1
sitting down and writing a budget that accounts for fixed and discretionary expenses is an important step for anyone who wants to be in control of their finances			0
yet it can be difficult to decide what discretionary expenses are appropriate -- especially if there is n't much left over after paying the bills			0
it should be a conscious process : you need to figure out what is most important to you and then make some tradeoffs			0
for example , my friend @entity95 hired a personal trainer , which strained her budget			0
she dropped the service , but became unmotivated to exercise on her own			1
i suggested she continue to work with the trainer while cutting down on eating out and also wait to go shopping until after she dropped to her desired pant size â € ” both of which helped motivate her towards her weight - loss goal			2
if you ca n't have it all at once , invest in what makes you feel best			0

my mother worked outside the home when i was growing up and always planned a week 's worth of meals so we could do all the grocery shopping at once			1
we also do this in my household now , and this kind of planning not only saves me time , but also cuts down on us throwing out unused food			2
thinking ahead makes it easier to budget in pricier selections , like fresh fish or more expensive cuts of meat , and also makes it less tempting to eat out , which can come with a high price tag â € ” and calorie count			2
if you like working out at a gym but want to save money , shop around			1
if the gym memberships in your area are too pricey , explore options at your workplace , local schools or community centers , which often offer free or low - cost activities			2
browse the @entity145 to see if there are group sports activities , like hiking , biking or running that you may join for free or a nominal cost			0
and if you think you 'd use them , consider at - home strength training or yoga dvds			0
