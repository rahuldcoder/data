-- it has n't been a blockbuster year for @entity2 , the video - gaming company that brought us " @entity4 , " " @entity5 " and the @entity6			1
sales of the @entity8 , @entity2 's latest gaming system , have been soft and the company has struggled to get enough top - tier games in front of the players clamoring for them			1
and while @entity13 and @entity14 have made headlines at @entity16 , the video game industry expo underway this week in @entity18 , @entity2 has kept a lower profile , forsaking its usual splashy keynote in favor of a smaller news conference			1
but @entity23 , president and ceo of @entity2 , believes the company can rebound by focusing on @entity8 games			1
in an interview this week for @entity0 , @entity23 admitted the company made missteps with the introduction of the @entity8 but he remains convinced a strong lineup of upcoming @entity8 software will get gamers excited about the living - room console			1
he just needs them to play it			0
" those people who have already purchased the @entity8 and are enjoying @entity8 , they have already realized the value of the @entity8 , and i understand that they are highly appreciating the entertainment experiences provided by @entity8 , " @entity23 said through a translator			1
" but the fact of the matter is @entity8 has yet to prove what is so unique ( about it ) , unlike how ... with a first glance , people were able to understand how different @entity6 was			0
" at @entity16 , @entity2 's booth on the trade - show floor offered people a hands - on experience with six new wii u titles : " @entity51 , " " @entity5 @entity52 , " " legend of zelda : @entity54 , " " @entity55 : @entity56 , " " @entity57 " and " @entity58 8			1
" @entity2 is letting fans demo four of these games -- " @entity55 : @entity56 , " " @entity61 , " " @entity62 " and " legend of zelda : @entity54 " -- at select @entity68 stores in @entity69 this saturday from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. players can also visit the @entity64 in @entity65 to try out the new titles			2
@entity2 faces increased competition from @entity13 and @entity14 , both of whom have new consoles -- the @entity75 and @entity76 , respectively -- coming out this fall in time for the holiday season			0
to compete , @entity23 believes @entity2 needs to get the games into as many people 's hands as possible so more gamers can understand the value of the @entity8 " we just do n't care too much about what other companies are doing or are trying to do , " he said			1
" our primary focus is to think about and actually carry out something which other company 's hardware can never realize			0
we are trying to provide consumers gaming experiences that can only be available on @entity2 platforms			0
" software sells hardware , " he added			0
" the number of hardware selling and the number of people who can experience the unique attractions of the @entity8 are going to increase , and thereby the knowledge and the understanding about the @entity8 system shall naturally expand			0
" @entity8 problems according to @entity2 's financial statement for the fiscal year ending march 31 , @entity8 hardware sales had a negative impact on the company 's profits to the tune of 36.4 billion yen , or more than $ 385.7 million			1
the report directly blames a delay in development of new games for the soft sales ( 3.45 million units worldwide )			0
but the company is forecasting 9 million units sold for this fiscal year based on its games - first plan			2
critics of the company have been saying the @entity8 needs more new and exciting games to succeed			2
@entity125 , online tech producer for @entity127 , said the @entity8 can rebound even though it might appear they are already behind the times			0
" once we see more first - party content for the @entity8 , we could see momentum improve , " @entity125 said			2
" but they need the equivalent of ' @entity136 ' for the @entity8 to convince consumers of the strength of the @entity139			0
there has n't been that kind of game yet			0
" @entity143 , video game columnist for the @entity145 , thinks games are indeed important to the future success of the @entity8 , but @entity2 's early mistakes with the console could hamper any recovery efforts			1
" @entity2 did a poor job in marketing the @entity153 part of its name with its predecessor was a misstep , " @entity143 explained			0
" the public was unsure if the @entity8 was a new console or a peripheral of the @entity6			0
@entity2 did n't make it clear in their marketing that the @entity8 was their new home console to replace the @entity6			1
" if history is any indicator , the release of games for the @entity8 could help drive hardware sales for @entity2			1
their handheld console , the @entity169 , also suffered from lagging hardware sales in the beginning but has rebounded to become a powerhouse in the marketplace			2
a may report by @entity176 , a video games market research company , said the handheld console sold more than 2 million units of first - party software titles in the first four months of 2013 , something that took them more than seven months to do last year			1
@entity169 was the only gaming platform to show a year - to - year growth despite an overall decrease in industry sales by 25 %			1
handheld gaming five of the top ten best selling franchises in home console history are exclusive to @entity2 -- @entity58 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity62 and @entity191			1
@entity125 said they need to get their stars out front			0
" @entity2 is n't just coming out with rehashes of the same game			2
they 're doing more to make sure these games are original , " @entity143 said			0
" ' @entity198 ' was one of the best franchises on the @entity6			0
they can keep reusing the same characters if you ask me , as long as they keep coming up with new ways to play			0
" in addition to the looming shadow of its competitors ' new consoles , @entity2 has also contended with the rise of smartphone gaming as a potential threat to its handheld @entity169 console			1
@entity23 says he 's not concerned			2
" there are a number of people who have watched the spread of smart devices today who are concluding that handheld gaming devices would not have a future at all , " @entity23 said			0
" ( but ) a number of trade people , retailers and distributors , are visiting the @entity16 show right now , and i understand they believe the potentially biggest seller for them this year ... is going to be @entity169			1
" according to @entity2 , @entity169 software sales of first - party titles in countries such as @entity231 , @entity232 and @entity233 are driving hardware sales as well			1
the company is projecting sales of 1.8 million hardware units and 8 million software units for the @entity169 in the next fiscal year			1
" @entity2 should be thankful for the success of the @entity169 , " @entity143 said			1
" they have managed to turn that handheld around since its dark beginnings , and it has become quite a success for them			0
" " whether it happens with @entity8 remains to be seen , " @entity125 added			0
again , it all comes back to games			0
but is it too late to get people 's attention ? @entity23 says no , and is ready to back it up with action			2
" starting from this summer , @entity2 is preparing for a very strong first - party software line - up that people really want to try out			2
by selling the software , we 'd like to expand the hardware sales of the @entity8 system			2

@entity2 president says new titles will turn around *lackluster* @entity8 sales
@entity265 company has kept low profile at this year 's @entity16 video - game expo
@entity23 compares @entity8 to @entity169 , which started slow then picked up
new " @entity270 , " " @entity189 " and " @entity272 " titles are on the way
