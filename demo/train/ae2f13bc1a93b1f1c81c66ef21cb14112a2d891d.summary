-- @entity2 prosecutors said in court friday they 'll seek the death penalty against @entity5 , a former justice of the peace accused of killing two prosecutors who served in the same county he did			1
but what they 'll do with the other person charged in the slayings -- @entity5 ' wife -- remains up in the air			2
@entity15 , @entity2 , assistant district attorney @entity16 was slain in january on his way to work at a courthouse			1
two months later , district attorney @entity19 and his wife , @entity20 , were fatally shot at their home near @entity23			1
a county grand jury tied all three killings together in april , when they indicted @entity5 and his wife , @entity27 , for capital murder			1
one big question , though , still loomed : would prosecutors try to get a death sentence for either or both @entity33 , should they be convicted of murder ? that was partially answered friday , in a brief hearing at the same @entity15 courthouse where @entity5 had been justice of the peace			1
special prosecutor @entity40 told @entity0 that he and his fellow prosecutor , @entity41 , announced in court that they will go for a death sentence against @entity5			1
but they did not indicate friday whether or not they 'll do the same with @entity46			0
" we have n't made our final decision , " @entity47 said , adding that there 's no deadline to make such a call			2
this scenario , as inconclusive as it might be , jives with what @entity46 ' lawyer told @entity0 on thursday			0
@entity56 said then that he expected prosecutors to seek death for @entity5 , but " was not so sure " about what they would do regarding his client			1
county sheriff @entity61 has previously said the three killings stemmed from @entity5 ' " past legal problems with the criminal justice system of this county , " including a 2012 conviction on burglary and theft charges that led to his removal from office			2
his wife , @entity27 , has confessed to her involvement in the killings and implicated her husband as the trigger man , according to court papers			2
in @entity16 's death , @entity46 was the getaway driver ; in the @entity79 ' killings , she was a passenger , @entity61 has said			0
in both cases , @entity5 fired the fatal shots , according to the sheriff			0
both @entity33 were arrested in april			0
@entity5 is also charged with making a terroristic threat , having been accused of using his home computer to threaten police investigating the @entity79 ' killings , according to a sheriff 's affidavit			2
he is being held on $ 23 million bond , according to @entity15 jail records			0
his wife -- who is seeking a divorce , her lawyer told @entity0 on thursday -- is being held on $ 10 million bond			0
@entity47 -- who , with @entity41 , was sworn in as a special prosecutor in the murder case two days after the @entity79 ' deaths -- said that the decision to seek the death penalty against one or both of the accused would not significantly impact their approach			1
" we just look forward to preparing the case and trying it in front of the jury , " the special prosecutor said			0
@entity0 's @entity109 contributed to this report .			0

a former justice of the peace and his wife were indicted later for murder in the 3 deaths
