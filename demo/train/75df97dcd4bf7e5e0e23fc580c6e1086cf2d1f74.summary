@entity0 , @entity1 -- charity has always been a part of every spiritual tradition , and learning to give is an essential part of everyone 's inner growth			1
however , charity has a dirty little secret that few of us want to face			2
it can fail or backfire			2
our gifts can be squandered			2
a dollar given with compassion may wind up lining the pockets of someone who does n't deserve it			1
it 's a healthy sign that the public has become more aware of these drawbacks			0
yet we have to be careful to ward off cynicism			0
to stop giving would be the wrong choice			1
here 's how i empower my own giving while at the same time bringing the compassionate gift closer to the right receiver			1
first of all , fuel an aspiration			0
the most hopeless people in the world are n't the poorest ; they 're the ones who can never fulfill even a tiny dream			1
as a group , women are the largest population of the helpless , so i look to help them any way i can			0
invest in the future , which means directing your gift to young people			1
know exactly where your money is going , and demand progress reports			1
take advantage of the multiplier effect			0
the reason micro-financing has taken off like wildfire is that small loans to individuals to help them buy their own land or start their own businesses turn out to pay off handsomely			0
the businesses get started and flourish			0
the loans are repaid quickly and thus multiply the effect of your gift			0
i participate in @entity61 , started by philanthropist @entity62 of the @entity63			0
but there are now many online resources for directing your gift into micro-financing			0
give generously of your spirit			1
if you can do this , money is secondary			1
personal guidance , mentoring and encouragement happen on a one - to - one basis			0
if you can bring your spirit into contact with someone else 's , your gift can change a life			1
these are simple , basic guidelines , but i believe in them wholeheartedly			0
i hope they come to mind the next time you get one of those annoying phone calls from a fast - talking , impersonal fundraiser who works for a cut of the money raised			2
there 's a better way to give , and it 's open to all of us			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity98 .			1

@entity98 : giving part of inner growth , but *corruption* in charities makes us pause
do n't stop giving , just be smart about it . seek accountability ; ask where your money goes
@entity98 : help people reach aspirations . invest in future
give of your spirit . helping someone in person can do more than money to change a life
