@entity0 ebbed and flowed with dramatic contrasts : laughter at sexual jokes versus the pain of impending persecution and prosecution ; @entity9 freedoms clashing with @entity11 culture ; an unwinnable battle between science and learned behavior ; nature and nurture			0
who decides ? president @entity16 did , in this moment , inking into law harsh penalties for gay people , supported overwhelmingly by @entity20			1
i was floored at the barrage of criticism belted out to @entity9			2
" arrogant western groups are to blame			0
" we do n't need your ( donor ) money			0
the press conference was attended by @entity32 , scientists , @entity20 officials and other journalists			1
i stepped out for a moment to do a report by telephone , which we call a beeper at @entity42 , and returned to a room that was pretty jovial			1
it felt uncomfortable to laugh about something that had such serious implications			0
" what did i miss ? " i asked my producer @entity48			0
" something about the mouth being for kissing and eating only , and not for going south , only north , " comments delivered by the president to more laughter , she said			2
i approached the mic and asked two questions that were significantly less amusing -- there was palpable tension in the room as a blanket of silence descended			0
i was in the minority , raising subjects like human rights and freedom of speech , and asking if he was n't taking @entity20 a step backwards in time ? the response tore into @entity9 values and ripped to shreds any willingness to tolerate @entity9 ideas around sexuality or " social imperialism , " as the president put it			1
now it 's easy to roll your eyes but i know this region , and many @entity11 think the imposition of social norms by the @entity80 or @entity9 and former colonial powers is offensive and unwanted , though they love @entity9 music , movies and cutting - edge technologies			2
overall , @entity85 are not generally anti-western			0
i was shocked when @entity16 declared , to even more clapping , that @entity20 does n't need aid money from the @entity87			1
i turned to @entity48 : " did he really just say that ? " she nodded and folded up the note we wrote to an aide requesting an exclusive interview with the president			2
newsflash to me : i realized then that @entity20 clearly did n't feel dependent on @entity9 aid money			1
perhaps @entity96 , a big @entity11 player , and @entity98 , could be stronger future allies			0
we caught the president on his way out of the room and he agreed to an exclusive @entity42 interview on the spot			1
we were whisked to the elegant boardroom and offices and set up			0
my colleagues @entity109 and @entity48 set up a two - camera shoot in five minutes			0
president @entity16 made his argument : gay people are disgusting , and i made mine : they are not			1
he laid out his case based on the scientific research he was presented with and insisted homosexuality was a learned social behavior that can be unlearned			0
i was born and bred in @entity119 and i believe that each individual has a right and the freedom to love whoever he or she chooses , gay , or straight			2
but here in @entity20 , i am in the minority here			1
why is he doing this ? moral conviction , but he is also looking ahead to the 2016 elections and the majority of his electorate is overwhelmingly anti-gay			2
however @entity16 denies it is an election ploy			1
as i drove past the shimmering @entity137 , towards @entity138 , one thing was for sure : it 's going to take a long time before the @entity87 and @entity20 can agree on this topic , if they ever will			1
for now , as the president articulated , the subject is " a no - go area			0

@entity42 's @entity146 *challenges* @entity20 president @entity16 over new anti-gay law
@entity16 says gay people are " disgusting " ; @entity146 says they are not
@entity146 attended a press conference to mark the new law
she was taken aback by the level of criticism of the @entity87
