-- a late goal from @entity3 international @entity2 saved @entity5 's blushes as they qualified for the @entity7 quarterfinals by beating @entity10 giants @entity8 3 - 2			1
with four minutes left at @entity12 's @entity11 , holders @entity5 looked like they were crashing out of the competition			2
despite taking an early lead through @entity18 , goals from @entity15 and @entity16 had put @entity8 back in control			0
but a superb @entity21 strike leveled the tie 2 - 2 on the night , yet @entity5 still trailed 3 - 2 on aggregate thanks to @entity8 's 1 - 0 victory in @entity5 three weeks previously			1
with the clock ticking down , @entity18 slalomed through @entity8 's defense , squaring for @entity2 who shot powerfully into the top left hand corner , leveling the tie 3 - 3 on aggregate and sending @entity5 through on away goals			1
" we have played too passively and made too many mistakes at the end , " @entity8 striker @entity16 told @entity30			0
" we did n't finish our chances to counter-attack , we could have led 4 - 1 or 5 - 1 if we had			0
you ca n't do something like that against a team like that without being punished			0
" in the other @entity7 match , @entity41 overcame @entity44 side @entity43 2 - 1			1
after holding the @entity45 to an impressive 0 - 0 draw at the @entity47 in the first leg , @entity43 rarely looked like scoring at @entity49 following some wayward finishing , with @entity44 international @entity51 and @entity52 particularly profligate			0
but profligacy was not a problem for @entity41 's @entity56 striker @entity55 who scored twice , taking his goal tally to 16 this season in all competitions			2
a late @entity61 own goal gave @entity43 some hope , but @entity41 held on to a deserved victory			1
" our experience saw us through in the end , i think , and it was a good result , for sure , " @entity41 's coach @entity64 told @entity65			0
the victory was @entity64 's 100 in the @entity7			0
