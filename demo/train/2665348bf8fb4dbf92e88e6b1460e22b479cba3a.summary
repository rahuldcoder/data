three days of intensive talks about @entity2 's nuclear program concluded early sunday without an agreement , though key players insisted they believed the process is moving in the right direction			1
" a lot of concrete progress has been achieved , but some differences remain , " @entity8 foreign policy chief @entity7 told reporters in @entity10 , @entity11			1
@entity2 foreign minister @entity15 echoed that sentiment , saying " hopefully we will be able to reach an agreement when we meet again			1
" " i think we are all on the same wavelength , and that 's important , " @entity15 said			2
" and that gives us the impetus to go forward			0
" the inclusion of top diplomats such as @entity15 , @entity25 and @entity27 secretary of state @entity26 left some thinking that this latest meeting could lead to a breakthrough to satisfy the international community 's desire that @entity2 not develop a nuclear weapon and , with that , a relaxation of crippling sanctions on the @entity37 nation			1
that did n't prove to be the case this time , though the parties -- including @entity41 -- will meet again november 20			0
both @entity25 and @entity15 fielded questions posited on the assumption @entity44 blocked a resolution this time around			0
but neither singled out any one party , with the @entity2 foreign minister saying differences among the countries are only " natural ... when we start dealing with the detail			1
" " we had a very good three days , a very productive three days , " @entity15 said			0
" and it 's something that we can build on			2
" @entity26 also voiced optimism , saying , " i can tell you , without any exaggeration , we not only narrowed differences but we made significant progress			2
... there 's no question in my mind that we are closer now			2
" at the same , the top @entity27 diplomat cautioned against jumping into any agreement that everyone is not comfortable with -- especially given the complicated , technical details to deal with and the need to " build confidence between countries that have really been at odds with each other for a long time now			1
" " diplomacy takes time , and all the parties here need time to fully consider the issues , " @entity26 said			1
@entity76 - @entity75 relations hit new snags as @entity26 visits @entity78 @entity2 president : @entity80 should n't miss ' unique opportunity ' it is widely believed that @entity2 harbors aspirations to produce nuclear weapons			1
repeated findings by @entity87 weapons inspectors indicate that the country appeared to be conducting nuclear weapons research			0
@entity2 has always maintained that its nuclear program is for purely peaceful purposes			1
even though @entity2 has denied working toward nuclear weapons , it has said it will not submit to any plan that would totally eliminate its nuclear program			1
for years , international leaders have been fearful of the instability a nuclear - armed @entity2 could bring to the @entity37			1
those fears , for example , include the possibility of a pre-emptive @entity76 strike that could spark a broader conflict			0
in the past , @entity2 has threatened @entity76 with military attack			2
@entity2 has been under crippling @entity87 sanctions related to its nuclear program since 2006 , and those sanctions have hobbled the nation 's economy			1
the @entity27 first sanctioned @entity2 over its nuclear program in 2000			1
the relatively sudden progress in recent meetings -- after years of stalemate -- follows a slight thaw in relations between @entity2 and the @entity80 under the newly elected president @entity111			1
@entity111 , himself , weighed in saturday from afar , taking to @entity113 to say " the @entity80 should not miss this unique opportunity			0
" saying the @entity2 delegation was participating in @entity10 " with strong will & determination , " @entity111 tweeted that " one of the slogans the @entity2 nation has embraced is that of ' constructive interaction with the world			2
' " the @entity2 president also spoke at a meeting with @entity126 foreign minister @entity125 , contending that resolving the nuclear issue will " help restore stability and tranquility to the entire region			1
" " the negotiating parties should bear in their mind that this opportunity was created following recent presidential election in @entity2 as the @entity2 peopled called for establishing a constructive interaction with the world , " @entity111 said , the state - run @entity131 reported			1
@entity2 's nuclear capabilities @entity76 : ' bad deal ' @entity76 prime minister @entity141 , who is not involved in the talks , warned that an agreement is " the deal of a century for @entity2 " but a " very dangerous and bad deal for peace			1
" " it 's a very bad deal , " he said			0
" @entity2 is not required to take apart even one centrifuge			2
but the international community is relieving sanctions on @entity2 for the first time after many years			1
@entity2 gets everything that it wanted at this stage and pays nothing			2
" a senior @entity76 government official says @entity76 backs a diplomatic solution that would dismantle @entity2 's military nuclear program , " dismantling all the centrifuges , the removal of the enriched uranium and the closure of the heavy water reactor			1
" if @entity2 wants nuclear power " for civilian purposes , as it claims , it has no need for centrifuges and heavy water			1
these are only required to produce nuclear weapons			0
like 17 other countries in the world ( e.g. @entity172 and @entity173 ) , she can do this without a centrifuge and without a heavy water reactor , " the @entity76 official said			0
a heavy water reactor at @entity180 , which weapons experts warn could be used to process weapons - grade plutonium , is under construction and could be activated early next year			0
once the reactor is activated , it could be dangerous to incapacitate			0
responding to @entity141 's remarks , @entity187 foreign secretary @entity186 asked for trust and understanding			1
" we have n't done the deal yet			0
we have n't made this deal yet			0
so i think everybody will have to comment on it if and when we reach a successful conclusion , and make their judgment about it then			0
so i 'd ask everyone to be patient and to wait for us to arrive at that conclusion if we can			0
" @entity186 stressed that any agreement would " require some flexibility on all sides			0
" he is cautiously optimistic , citing the mood among diplomats			0
" the atmosphere of these negotiations , as others have told you before , is completely different from the atmosphere of a few months ago			0
clearly , dealing with these ministers from @entity2 is a different experience from the recent past			2
so a lot of progress has been made , but it 's too early to say that we will reach a successful conclusion today , " @entity186 said			2
@entity220 : new sanctions on @entity2 needed @entity27 officials outline possible deal two senior @entity27 administration officials said that , under the potential deal , @entity2 would agree : to stop enriching nuclear fuel to 20 % purity			1
to render unusable most of its existing stockpile of such fuel			0
not to use advanced @entity232 centrifuges , which can enrich nuclear fuel five times faster than older centrifuges			0
not to activate a plutonium reactor at @entity180			0
in turn , the @entity237 would agree : to unfreeze some @entity2 assets held in banks overseas			2
to consider easing sanctions banning trade in gold , precious metals and petrochemicals			0
other sweeteners were also under consideration , they said			0
one of the officials said the deal is designed to " stop @entity2 's progress by stopping the shortening of time by which they could build a nuclear weapon " while providing temporary , reversible sanctions relief to @entity2			1
that official cautioned that the deal is not done but said it could happen if the @entity2 agree to the @entity237 's demands			1
the @entity237 or @entity260 -- comprises the @entity27 , @entity44 , @entity187 , @entity261 , @entity262 and @entity263			2

@entity27 secretary of state says " diplomacy takes time "
@entity2 's foreign minister says the meetings are " something that we can build on "
@entity8 official : " concrete progress has been achieved , but ... differences remain "
this marks the latest movement after years of stalemate on @entity2 's nuclear program
