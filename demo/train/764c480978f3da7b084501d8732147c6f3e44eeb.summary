@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity6 , in a bid to create jobs and boost economic growth , called on @entity7 on monday to pass a $ 50 billion plan to renew the country 's transportation infrastructure			1
his address was the first of two speeches the president is scheduled to make this week to frame his administration 's ongoing response to the recession , less than two months ahead of midterm elections in which @entity19 majorities in the @entity20 and @entity21 are in jeopardy			1
" today , i am announcing a new plan for rebuilding and modernizing @entity28 's roads , and rails and runways for the long term , " said @entity6 , who spoke on @entity23 in @entity0 , @entity1 -- a state with competitive gubernatorial and @entity21 races			1
" we used to have the best infrastructure in the world			0
we can have it again , " he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers			0
the proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads , 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways			2
it also would include modernizing the nation 's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time			0
" this will not only create jobs immediately			0
it 's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul , " said the president			1
@entity6 hopes to work with @entity7 to enact an up - front investment of $ 50 billion -- an amount a @entity20 statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure			1
the investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending			0
the long - term plan would include the establishment of an @entity70 , which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck , @entity6 said			1
the president stressed the need for @entity19 and @entity77 to work together on the transportation initiative , which would need to be approved by @entity7			2
@entity7 returns from recess next week and will likely be in session for less than a month before leaving @entity81 for midterm elections			2
on monday , before @entity6 's speech , senate minority leader @entity83 , @entity84 , criticized the plan and said @entity28 do not want to pay want higher taxes			1
" a last - minute , cobbled - together stimulus bill with more than $ 50 billion in new tax hikes will not reverse the complete lack of confidence @entity28 have in @entity81 @entity19 ' ability to help this economy , " he said in a statement			0
@entity6 is focused this week on the economy , after a week in which his administration concentrated on @entity98 peace talks and the end of @entity28 's combat role in @entity101			1
senior aides have said the president recently asked his economic team to come up with various proposals he could roll out to show he 's working hard to kick - start growth			0
ideas have included more federal spending on infrastructure projects and tax cuts popular with the business community , such as a permanent extension of the research and development tax credit			0
however , a @entity2 / @entity115 survey released friday suggests the @entity20 still has work to do to win over the @entity28 public			0
nearly six in 10 respondents disapproved of @entity6 's track record on the economy , which is the no. 1 issue in the minds of @entity28			1
on wednesday , the president is scheduled to deliver an economic speech in hard - hit @entity124 , @entity125 -- a state that has competitive @entity128 and @entity21 races that will help determine control of @entity7			2
