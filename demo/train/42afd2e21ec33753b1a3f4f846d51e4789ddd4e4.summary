@entity0 -- between the @entity10 threat , fears about @entity4 , a slow economic recovery and little enthusiasm for president @entity7 or @entity8 , it 's hard to believe that many @entity11 feel good about anything			1
but an overlooked piece of data in a recent @entity1 / @entity16 poll revealed a surprising number of @entity11 are upbeat despite the seemingly constant onslaught of bad news			1
when asked , " how are things going in the country today , " 50 % of respondents said things were going either " very well " or " fairly well			1
" of course , that 's not an overwhelming vote of confidence in the @entity27			2
and , indeed , 49 % of people in the same survey felt the country was in bad shape			1
still , it is the first time at least half of the people who took part in @entity1 's regular surveys expressed that much confidence since april 2013			1
and it was only the seventh time at least 50 % said that they felt this good since early in 2004			1
in some ways this relative equanimity may not be as surprising as it may seem at first blush			2
for some time , researchers have seen a brightening mood in the country about the economy			1
and despite breathless concerns being voiced in several quarters that the existence of several @entity10 patients would transform the @entity11 into a sequel of the movie " contagion , " the public has not become very worried about the disease			1
according to @entity59 , @entity1 's polling director , the percentage of people who feel good about the current status of the country , " has been ticking up the last few times we asked the question			1
it went down when the @entity4 crisis started and before the @entity67 airstrikes started			2
that tells me that people were worried about @entity4 , but they became less concerned when the @entity11 started taking some sort of action			1
" the optimism is n't much help to @entity75 heading into the midterm elections weighed down by unhappiness with @entity7			1
majorities in the same @entity1 / @entity16 poll still disapprove of his handling of the economy , foreign affairs and health care policy			1
half of those surveyed also disapprove of his handling of terrorism			2
and the sanguine mood can also be ephemeral , changing from week to week as different news events impact the sense of calm			2
for example , the @entity1 / @entity16 poll was conducted before the death of @entity97 , the @entity98 man who was hospitalized in @entity99 with @entity10 and the news that one of the health care working tending to him also contracted the disease			2
there is no question that the @entity1 / @entity16 survey is out of step of most polls that depict the @entity11 public in a fearful and dour mood			1
just this week , a @entity113 / @entity112 poll found that two - thirds of registered voters felt the country is on the " wrong track , " while just a quarter believe it was headed in the right direction			1
the varying results could be explained in the difference in the question 's wording			2
asking how things are going today prompts a person to make a clear - eyed assessment of the status of the country right now			0
the right track / wrong track question asks people to gage how things will be in the future			0
it is not inconceivable for a person to feel pretty sanguine about the current states of affairs , but very worried about what could be around the corner			0
" there have been times in @entity11 history -- and this may be one of them -- when people feel things are ok right now , but there are good reasons to be concerned about what may happen in the future , " @entity59 said			1
beyond feeling somewhat better @entity4 , there is the economy			0
it is possible that lower unemployment , an uptick in consumer spending and the robust growth in gdp growth may be starting to affect outlook			0
" there are a lot of polls showing improvement in the public 's perception of how the economy is doing , " said @entity161 , a resident scholar at the @entity162 who specializes in analyzing polls and public opinion			0
" having said that , it 's been a long , slow road to full recovery			0
" while some experts say that the continued stagnation in wage growth contributes most to the publics displeasure with the economy , there is one trend that is making a large contribution to the improve public mood : gasoline prices			0
despite continued turmoil in the @entity189 , prices at the pump are set to be at their lowest level since 2010 , according to @entity191 , which tracks prices in @entity193			0
the website says 10 % of the country 's gas stations are pricing a gallon of regular gasoline under $ 3.00			2
while many economic statistics such as gdp growth and jobless figures are mere abstractions to most people , gasoline prices are a tangible marker visible on almost every street corner , every day			0
" one economic indicator you see once every few minutes while driving around your neighborhood is the price of gas , " said @entity207 , a senior fellow at the @entity208			0
" it registers with people when that improves and i believe it feeds into consumer confidence and polling results			0
" happiness about the fall in gasoline prices could be offset by increases in the cost of meat , bread , milk and other food staples			0
but since studies indicate that women overwhelmingly still do the grocery shopping , men are somewhat insulated from confronting fluctuations in food prices			0
in contrast , everyone sees changes in the price of gas as they drive around town			0
that may be one reason why 56 % of men felt things were going well in the country , compared to 44 % of women			1
" gasoline is magical , " says @entity247 , senior oil analyst for @entity191			0
" everybody knows what they pay for it			0

many @entity11 still optimistic despite *negative* *headlines* .
optimism is n't helping @entity75 heading into the midterms .
poll shows this is only the seventh time since 2004 that at least 50 % said they felt this good .
