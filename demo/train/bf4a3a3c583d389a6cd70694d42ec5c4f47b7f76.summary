@entity0 , @entity1 -- police and protesters clashed across @entity1 on monday amid a nationwide strike and widespread protests over a government decision that more than doubled fuel prices in the largely impoverished country			1
among other incidents , police reportedly fired on protesters in the northern @entity1 state of @entity13 , injuring at least 13 people , according to a physician who was among the protesters			1
demonstrators were gathered listening to speeches when police " suddenly came and some were shooting and some were throwing tear gas , " @entity17 , vice chairman of the @entity18 , told @entity2			2
@entity17 said one protester , a 12 - year - old boy , was shot in the neck			0
another protester was shot in the groin , he said			0
" we were trying to re-enact what took place in @entity32 at @entity33 , " @entity17 said of what had been peaceful protests			0
@entity13 police commissioner @entity34 denied that officers fired on protesters			1
he said that officers were forced to use tear gas on " miscreants and drug addicts " who had tried to storm the governor 's residence			2
" these people were trying to take advantage of the situation and loot , they are criminals , " he told @entity2			0
the protests have otherwise been largely peaceful , and officers were working alongside the @entity51 , one of the groups staging the nationwide strikes , @entity34 said			0
elsewhere , @entity55 , a union official , said three union members had been killed by police gunfire during a peaceful protest in @entity0			1
but sunday @entity59 , a trade union president , said he had no reports of union members dying			0
there was no immediate comment from @entity1 authorities on those accounts of violence			1
@entity0 , a city of nearly 8 million people , was eerily quiet monday afternoon			0
with many businesses shut down amid a call for a nationwide strike , few cars traveled the city 's normally teeming roads			0
residents had packed stores on sunday , laying in supplies in anticipation of the protests and strikes , @entity75 newspaper of @entity1 reported			1
the commander of the @entity83 and @entity84 , @entity85 , deployed 43,000 members of the paramilitary force and 160,000 volunteers in response to the planned strike and protests , warning protesters " against indulging in criminal activities , " according to a notice posted on the organization 's facebook page			2
the protests and strikes follow the government 's january 1 decision to remove fuel subsidies in the country , which is @entity102 's largest oil producer			1
read about what is behind the fuel strike citizens of @entity102 's most populous nation have staged " @entity108 " mass demonstrations since the decision , with police responding forcefully in some cases			1
" i am not an economist , but it is clear common sense that the removal of fuel subsidy , even if it seems to be the easiest solution , is not even an option , " said @entity112 , an @entity113 protester			1
" the fuel hike , which has doubled and even tripled in some states , would affect not only transportation but the price of foodstuff , clothing , any form of direct labor , construction costs			2
but salaries still remain the same , which means everyone who directly pays bills will be affected , especially the middle class and the poor			0
" many @entity1 view the subsidy as the only benefit of living in an oil - producing country that has little infrastructure , poor roads , high unemployment and intermittent electric power			1
are you there ? share your story " though we know that in the long run , removal of subsidy will help the economy , for now it is a high - profile lifestyle that is unbearable for most @entity1 , and soon the poorer ones will die out , " said protester @entity147 , who lives in @entity113			1
money saved by removing the subsidy will help improve public amenities and build much - needed infrastructure , said @entity159 , a spokesman for president @entity160			2
but there is a widespread lack of trust in the government to provide the infrastructure -- @entity1 is regularly voted among the most corrupt countries in the world			1
the nation produces around 2.4 million barrels of crude oil a day , but it imports roughly 70 % of its gasoline from countries as far afield as the @entity173 and @entity174 , because most of its own refineries are inoperative after years of corruption - fueled neglect			0
in a televised address , @entity160 urged citizens to avoid " mindless acts of violence " and said he empathized with those protesting against the government 's decision to cut fuel subsidies			1
" if i were in your shoes , i probably would ... hold the same critical views about government , " the president said saturday			0
the government has shunned calls to resume the subsidy , and it has ordered the distribution of mass transit buses to major cities			2
@entity160 said the decision to cut the subsidies will benefit the public in the future			0
the @entity202 @entity201 in @entity113 warned @entity202 to stockpile food , conserve fuel and delay travel while the strike and protests are ongoing			0
@entity2 's @entity208 , @entity210 's @entity209 and journalist @entity211 contributed to this report .			0
