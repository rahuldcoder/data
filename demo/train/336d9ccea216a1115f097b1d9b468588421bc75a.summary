-- the @entity4 capsule remains on course for the @entity6 despite losing one of nine booster engines , but a satellite launched on the same rocket did n't reach its intended orbit , its operator said monday			1
@entity4 launched the first commercial space cargo mission on sunday night			1
but a minute and 19 seconds after the @entity15 booster lifted off from @entity16 , @entity17 , one of the nine @entity20 engines that power the rocket " lost pressure suddenly , " the company disclosed monday			2
the rocket " did exactly what it was designed to do , " as its flight computer made adjustments to keep the @entity4 headed into the proper orbit			1
the unmanned capsule , which is carrying about 1,000 pounds of supplies for the space station , is scheduled to arrive at the orbital platform on wednesday , @entity4 said			1
opinion : @entity4 -- a pioneer in space and on @entity36 however , the rocket also was carrying a satellite for the @entity40 - based communications company @entity39			1
the satellite separated properly from the second stage of the @entity15 -- but the engine trouble meant the satellite would not pass clear of a safety zone if it fired its own engine , leaving it in a lower orbit than planned , @entity39 said in a statement issued monday night			0
engineers from @entity39 and its partner on the project , @entity61 , " have been in contact with the satellite and are working to determine if and the extent to which the orbit can be raised to an operational orbit using the satellite 's on - board propulsion system , " the statement said			2
neither @entity4 nor @entity39 responded to request for comment about the satellite issue			0
@entity64 - based @entity4 said earlier that controllers are reviewing flight data in an effort to figure out what happened to the booster rocket , but initial readings indicate the no. 1 engine fairing broke apart under stress			1
in may : @entity4 returns to @entity36 after ' grand slam ' space mission " we know the engine did not explode , because we continued to receive data from it , " the company said			2
but it said two of @entity83 's @entity82 boosters lost engines on two flights during the @entity86 , and the @entity15 9 " is designed to handle an engine - out situation and still complete its mission			0
" the failure occurred second after the booster achieved supersonic speed and approached its moment of maximum aerodynamic pressure after liftoff			0
@entity95 posted online by the company shows a flash as the rocket ascends , followed by what appears to be debris falling away from the accelerating craft			0
sunday 's launch was the first of a dozen freight runs that @entity4 is scheduled to make to the station under a contract with @entity83 , which plans to turn much of its focus toward exploring deep into the solar system			1
@entity83 administrator @entity109 called it " a critical event in space flight			0
" @entity4 , meanwhile , is looking beyond just cargo flights to developing a human - rated version of the dragon that would carry astronauts to the iss. it 's one of three companies , along with @entity61 and aerospace giant @entity120 , that @entity83 has chosen to work on the project			0
and within the next few months , @entity122 is expected to fly its own demonstration flight to the space station			1
instead of using @entity16 as its launch site , the company 's rocket will take off from @entity128 , off the coast of @entity130			2
@entity122 has a nearly $ 2 billion contract with @entity83 for station resupply missions .			0

new : communications company says its satellite did n't reach proper orbit
one of nine rocket engines failed on the @entity4 booster after sunday 's launch
the flight computer adjusted for the failure and kept the @entity4 on course
the unmanned capsule is scheduled to reach the space station on wednesday
