mourning three @entity1 teenagers at their funeral tuesday , @entity1 prime minister @entity0 promised his nation will avenge their deaths at " the hands of evil men " and show its strength in the process			1
" throughout the history of our people , we have proved time and again -- in view of the horrors that we have experienced , the grief and sorrow -- the force of life that pulsates within us overcomes the forces of death , " he said in @entity10 , according to a @entity12 translation			0
the @entity1 leader lamented the killings of the three " gifted , pure , honest and decent teens , " bloodshed that he said shows " a broad moral gulf ( that ) separates us from our enemies			1
" " they sanctify death , we sanctify life , " @entity0 said , comparing the teens to those who killed them			1
" they sanctify cruelty , and we mercy and compassion			0
that is the secret of our strength			0
" a short time later -- after the burials of @entity43 , 19 ; @entity44 , 16 ; and @entity45 , a 16 - year - old dual @entity47 - @entity1 citizen , by each other in @entity49 -- the prime minister spoke again about the three before a security cabinet meeting , saying , " may @entity52 avenge their blood			1
" " whoever was involved in the kidnapping and the murder will bear the consequences , " @entity0 said tuesday evening			2
" we will neither rest nor slacken until we reach the last of them			0
and it does not matter where they will try to hide			0
" these actions are well underway			0
the @entity1 leader noted that , already , hundreds of @entity66 activists have been arrested , dozens of institutions in @entity68 have closed and homes have been demolished			1
this is along with stepped - up airstrikes in @entity68 -- @entity73 land controlled by @entity66 , a militant @entity74 organization that denied it is behind the abductions			1
the @entity1 military said it launched 34 strikes targeting terror infrastructure targets since sunday evening in response to 18 rockets from @entity68			2
the @entity73 cabinet on tuesday claimed 12 @entity73 have been killed since the military operation to find the teens began june 13 ; it did not identify them by name , nor detail how or when they died			0
@entity12 reported earlier , citing @entity73 medical sources , that at least one man died from a heart attack during a raid on his @entity89 home last month ; at least five were killed in clashes with the @entity1 military ; and two men accused by the @entity1 military of being involved in recent rocket attacks were killed in an airstrike last week in @entity68			2
addressing " all of those who are ... happy at our sadness , " @entity1 president @entity95 warned at tuesday 's funeral , " @entity100 is a boomerang			1
" " i know that we will eventually get our hands on the murderers , " @entity95 said , " and they will be punished			0
" @entity1 leader : ' @entity66 will pay ' the bodies of @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 were found monday , nearly three weeks after their abduction while hitchhiking home from school in the @entity89			1
@entity112 president @entity111 , who heads the @entity114 party and is based in the @entity89 , has condemned the abductions , even as the @entity73 @entity81 has criticized what it calls " @entity1 's illegal measures " in response			2
yet @entity119 , a spokesman for @entity0 , suggested monday that @entity111 ' @entity112 bears some responsibility for what happened because " the terrorists came from areas under @entity112 control and returned to territories under @entity112 control			1
" still , while @entity111 and the @entity112 are clearly feeling the pressure , it 's nothing compared to that facing @entity66 just listen to @entity0 on tuesday evening : " @entity66 is responsible			1
@entity66 will pay , and @entity66 will continue to pay			1
" the @entity130 named two men -- @entity132 and @entity133 -- as the " @entity66 terrorists who kidnapped " the boys			2
their @entity89 homes were destroyed overnight			0
@entity73 news agency @entity137 reported tuesday that a little - known group called @entity142 as - @entity140 ( supporters of the @entity139 ) had claimed responsibility for the killings and threatened to " slaughter " the @entity112			1
@entity12 could not independently verify the claim			0
@entity66 has made no such claim			2
still , as it bears the brunt of the retaliation , the group warned that if @entity0 " brings a war on @entity68 , the gates of hell will open to him			1
" @entity154 : @entity1 , @entity112 should work together the teens ' kidnappings and killings -- as well as the @entity1 response -- have spurred strong reactions well outside the @entity160 , including among @entity47 politicians , @entity163 's mayor and the @entity164			2
the advocacy group @entity166 , for instance , said the killings " would amount to a war crime if committed by an armed group " even as it urged @entity1 to avoid " collective punishment			2
" @entity171 prime minister @entity170 has called the teens ' deaths " an appalling and inexcusable act of terror			1
" @entity47 president @entity154 similarly condemned what he called a " senseless act of terror against innocent youth			0
" he reiterated " our full support to @entity1 and the @entity112 to find the perpetrators of this crime and bring them to justice			0
" " and i encourage @entity1 and the @entity112 to continue working together in that effort , " @entity154 said			0
" i also urge all parties to refrain from steps that could further destabilize the situation			0
" opinion : slain teens call for justice , not escalation			0

@entity1 prime minister @entity0 says @entity66 is responsible , " will pay "
@entity1 has arrested hundreds , demolished homes , closed institutions , he adds
