-- the last of the teams to play their opening match take the pitch , and @entity5 and @entity6 meet in a battle of the @entity9 leaders			1
the last time we saw @entity12 , they were stunned by @entity13 at @entity14 in 2010			0
they take on @entity18 favorites @entity16 in the first match of the day			1
after @entity5 and @entity6 scrap , @entity20 meets @entity22 in the other @entity18 match			1
here 's what to look forward to during tuesday 's matches at the @entity26 : @entity27 hurts against @entity30 , @entity29 midfielder hulk was replaced in the second half by @entity32			2
during practice sunday , @entity27 was stung by a leg injury and sat out most of the workout			2
so will hulk have to take the bench ? and will @entity6 's @entity37 again play a reserve role ? it appears that way			2
and remember , if either team wins , it will have six points and that likely puts them in the knockout round			0
new verse , same as the first @entity6 and @entity5 meet in @entity46 , just like last year in the @entity47			2
that match was also the teams ' second group match and it was also played in mid-june			0
@entity5 comfortably won that contest 2 - 0 and @entity52 was man of the match			1
@entity5 will have to play with more passion to have a similar result against a confident @entity58 team			2
@entity60 youth @entity16 is one of those opponents that make you say , " no problem , " then they go out and beat you 2 - 0			1
they are tough on defense and they have some of the best young players in @entity69			0
some clubs in @entity16 are taking in some serious coin because many of their young stars move to @entity74 to play			1
in 2012 , a @entity60 newspaper totaled the transfer fees and estimated @entity16 's top 11 players were third in the world in such payments			1
heading the wrong way @entity22 has lost five of its last seven international matches , including a 2 - 1 loss to tuesday 's opponent , @entity20 , in november			1
on the other hand , @entity20 has n't lost since august			0
but @entity20 is missing injured captain @entity86 and the weather will be much warmer than what their players -- all of whom play domestically -- are used to for game conditions			0
reason to love : @entity12 probably the only team whose national anthem was written in blood , at least that 's how the story goes			0
the words were written in 1956 by @entity103 , who was imprisoned in @entity104			0
legend has it that he had no pencils or paper so he wrote on the walls of his cell with his blood .			0

one of @entity5 's stars may have to *sit* out after a practice injury
@entity16 has a youth - filled squad that plays solid defense
@entity22 's *recent* results do n't give its fans much hope
