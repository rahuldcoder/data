-- @entity2 soccer stars @entity3 and @entity4 have indicated they will stay at their respective clubs despite being linked with big - money moves in the @entity8 close - season			1
@entity9 star @entity3 has reportedly again been targeted by @entity4 's @entity11 side @entity10 , who wanted the former world player of the year before he moved to @entity14 from @entity15 in 2009			1
and @entity4 was expected to leave @entity10 , having asked for a transfer in january after citing his unhappiness at being so far away from his young family in their native @entity19			1
@entity3 has struggled to make an impact at the @entity22 since his $ 92 million transfer , and missed the first four months of this season with a knee injury			1
newspaper reports have linked @entity10 , @entity15 and @entity27 -- whose manager @entity28 was his coach at the @entity30 -- with a potential bid for the 29 - year - old , but he insists he wants to stay in @entity33			1
" i want to stay at @entity33 and i want to play for @entity33 , " he said at a boot launch in quotes reported by the @entity37 @entity36			1
" my mother is coming to live in @entity39 next year			1
she is a preacher and she is coming to talk about @entity40			0
but i have a challenge with @entity33			2
i do n't want to think now about playing in the @entity42 or going back to @entity43			0
" i want to get back in good shape and play for @entity33 next season			2
i have a good relationship with @entity28 but the truth is that i want to stay in @entity33 , i want to play in @entity33 and i want to live in @entity33			2
" @entity4 had been linked with a move to @entity14 or @entity43 , but his manager @entity50 said the striker had indicated he was happy to stay in @entity52 after helping @entity10 qualify for the @entity54 next season and end a 35 - year wait for a trophy by winning the @entity57 on saturday			1
" i spoke with him many times in the last 20 days , " @entity50 told reporters after his captain scored twice in tuesday 's 3 - 0 win over @entity61 which lifted @entity10 above @entity62 into third place ahead of the final round			1
" he has a five - year contract and he has told us he wants to stay			0
in december he had a problem but everyone can change his opinion			0
i do n't know what his representatives think			0
" @entity4 is an important player here			2
the feeling for him is good			0
nowhere else can he find behavior that all people have for him			0
" however , @entity50 's comments came after @entity4 had cast more doubt over his future following saturday 's 1 - 0 win over the same opposition at @entity39 's @entity81			1
" i want to make it clear that i do n't have any problem with @entity50 , despite what people have written and said to the contrary , " the 25 - year - old said			2
" but i need to sit down with my family , because we need to make this decision together			0
i repeat , there is no problem with @entity50			0
it is a family thing			0
but really , i have n't made a decision yet			0
