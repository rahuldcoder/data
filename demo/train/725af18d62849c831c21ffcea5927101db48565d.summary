-- when @entity2 triggered a fiscal feud with the @entity5 government a few weeks ago , the media had fun recasting him in his movie role as the comic book character @entity9 , a fat and superhumanly strong @entity11 who stands up to the @entity13			1
now that the @entity5 movie star has abandoned the land of the @entity18 to become a @entity20 citizen , his recent film role as the mad monk @entity15 is being evoked to put a cinematic image on a bizarre real - life drama that has become an affair of state			1
@entity2 's " defection " to @entity20 has both amused and angered his compatriots			1
the actor has not helped matters with his puzzling public statements			0
@entity2 , whose father was a communist , praised @entity20 as a " great democracy , " a description open to some debate given that country 's history			1
over the weekend , @entity2 made a visit to @entity20 that was splashed all over the media in @entity20 -- and was the first item on the @entity5 evening news on sunday			1
@entity5 television viewers watched footage of @entity2 defend @entity43 and proudly brandish his new @entity20 passport			1
@entity2 's love for @entity20 can not be indifferent to the country 's flat 13 % income tax rate , measurably lower than the 75 % rate that @entity5 's socialist government will impose this year on income over a million euros			1
@entity2 , whose personal fortune is estimated at $ 200 million , at first bolted for @entity52 to escape the tax			2
now he has accepted the warm embrace of his friend @entity43			0
@entity5 's constitutional court overturned the " supertax " on the rich , but the @entity58 government intends to push forward with the measure			1
@entity2 said he admires @entity20 for its history and great artists			2
yet his affection for the @entity65 world has not been without controversy			0
he is a friend of @entity67 , the autocratic president of the @entity20 republic of @entity69 who has invited other @entity72 stars such as @entity73 and @entity74 to his birthday parties to flatter his over-sized self - image			0
more bizarrely , @entity2 recorded a duet titled " @entity78 " with the glamorous @entity79 -- known as " @entity79 " -- daughter of @entity82 's autocratic ruler @entity81			2
his critics in @entity5 look upon @entity2 's posturing as the latest misadventure in the actor 's turbulent life			1
recently , he was arrested and jailed for driving his scooter through @entity89 in a state of intoxication			0
he was also kicked off an airplane in @entity93 for relieving himself on board			0
a man of gargantuan appetites referred to affectionately in @entity5 as " @entity97 " , @entity2 is a larger - than - life figure whose recent travails have highlighted deep tensions in @entity5 society			2
@entity2 is not the only fabulously wealthy citizen to leave @entity5 to escape the country 's punishing income taxes			1
in the past , @entity5 rocks stars such as @entity107 and tennis players such as @entity109 have attracted criticism for moving to @entity111			0
tax exile is frowned on in @entity5 , a country where fiscal obligation is considered a gesture of loyalty to the @entity5 nation			0
opinion : why @entity2 's ' pathetic ' desertion has caused @entity5 storm @entity5 is also a traditionally @entity121 culture suspicious of money and hostile toward the wealthy			1
@entity5 president @entity123 declared publicly during last year 's election campaign : " i do n't like the rich			2
" in @entity5 politics that kind of declaration resonates with voters			0
the @entity5 are cynical about their elites in general , and hostile toward the rich in particular			2
in the late 17th century , @entity132 infamously expelled nearly a million @entity133 who at that time were a rich and powerful minority active in banking and finance			0
today @entity5 's billionaires , such as @entity140 heiress @entity139 , tend to stay discreetly out of view and lack the same spirit of charity found in @entity144			1
@entity5 has no @entity145 or @entity146			0
the super-rich in @entity5 give money to politicians , not to charities			0
@entity2 may be a hugely popular movie actor in @entity5 , but when he put his sumptuous digs in the fashionable @entity153 section of @entity89 on the market for nearly $ 66 million it reminded the @entity5 that he belongs to a different universe			2
even more controversial is @entity2 's choice to become a @entity20 citizen , which is an open gesture of defiance and rejection toward the @entity5 nation			1
@entity5 is a country whose mythology of " national identity " is deeply entrenched in the collective psyche			0
the notion of the " @entity5 exception " reinforces the idea that @entity5 is different and can resort to extraordinary means to protect its national identity , usually by heavy state intervention			0
in @entity5 , citizenship is cherished , something that foreigners aspire to			0
when one of @entity5 's most famous and loved movie stars hands back his passport and flounces out of the national family , it can be interpreted as an act of betrayal			1
many of @entity2 's critics in @entity5 have preferred to use the language of sarcasm , dismissing him as a troubled figure out of touch with the realities of his fellow countrymen			1
the @entity5 newspaper @entity188 pointed out that @entity20 commentators are saying that @entity2 is being naively exploited by @entity43			1
the @entity20 leader , they argue , is using the @entity2 saga as a pr exercise for internal purposes			2
@entity2 has been seen knocking about his familiar precincts on the @entity196 of @entity89			0
when he leaves the country , he will have to return next time showing a @entity20 passport			0
meanwhile , the @entity5 film starring @entity2 as @entity15 still has not been released in his new @entity20 homeland			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .			0
