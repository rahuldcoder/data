-- with the one - track mind of a 6 - year - old , @entity1 interrogated his mother , @entity4			1
why are the other moms skinnier than you ? he asked at the park			2
if you took weight loss pills , would you be skinny ? he wondered during a tv infomercial			1
@entity11 brushed off his questions			1
he was 6 and curious about the world around him			0
she was exhausted , trying to care for two young boys and her husband , who had chronic health issues			1
her own health had fallen to the bottom of the to - do list			1
but @entity1 's last question hit her like , well , the elephant in the room			1
if you got skinny , would you be able to play with me ? " my heart broke , " @entity11 wrote on @entity27			1
" and from that moment forward , i began the transformation into a healthier lifestyle for my children			0
" when @entity11 stepped on the scale in june 2012 , the number 200 came as no surprise			1
more than a dozen people had asked her over the past few years whether she was pregnant			2
two had rubbed her belly when there was no baby at all			0
the extra weight caused pain in @entity11 's hips when she walked , and the doctor warned that she was on the verge of type 2 diabetes			1
she had tried dieting after her second son , @entity47 , was born			2
@entity48 helped her drop 10 pounds , but she quickly gained 20 back			2
her sister , " a health nut , " encouraged her to try different cleanses			2
all left her feeling like a failure			0
she was depressed , anxious and overwhelmed			0
" you know , i started every monday dreaming i could change my life , " @entity11 remembered			1
" it was nearly a decade of that			0
" @entity1 's question made her realize she was missing her sons ' lives -- and her own			1
@entity11 started counting calories , keeping her daily total under 1,500			1
she also began going on short walks around the block and parked her car in the farthest spot from the grocery store door			0
a few months later , @entity11 and her husband separated			1
but instead of using food to cope with the rush of emotions as she once would have , @entity11 turned to exercise			1
" i used that as more motivation to stay healthy for the boys , " she said			0
" my goodness , if i 'm going to have to do this on my own and be an example for them , i have to be strong			0
" working out was difficult at first ; the pain in her hips prevented her from moving very far , very fast			0
but over time she joined a walking club at work and started strength training one or two days a week			0
she focused on losing just 5 pounds at a time , because the thought of losing 60 pounds to reach a healthy @entity91 was intimidating			0
reaching each smaller goal inspired her to keep going			2
by march 2013 , she had lost 64 pounds			2
" when you 're that heavy , you feel like you 've lost hope , " @entity11 said			2
" when you finally reach your goal , it 's the most amazing thing			2
" every sunday , the @entity11 family goes on a 10 - mile bike ride near their home in @entity101 , @entity102			1
they eat no - sugar cereal and skim milk for breakfast , lean cuisine meals or veggie smoothies for lunch , and lean protein with vegetables and brown rice for dinner			0
@entity114 is @entity11 's " secret weapon			1
" her diet has become a lifestyle			0
she 's careful about what she eats but allows herself treats in moderation			0
deprivation is not the way to keep the weight off , she knows			0
@entity11 's energy is up , and her pain is gone			1
but the happiness she feels ca n't compare to the joy on her sons ' faces when she joins them on the playground			0
" i am able to take my kiddos to the park and actually play with them instead of sitting on the sidelines			0
