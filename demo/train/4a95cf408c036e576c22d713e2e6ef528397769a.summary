@entity1 , @entity0 -- the much - maligned symbol of motoring in communist @entity5 , the trabant , is set to make an unlikely comeback as a concept car at this year 's @entity10 in @entity11			1
the old - style @entity12 is a common sight in @entity5 where tourist operators use the car for local tours			1
designers have replaced the car 's smoke - belching two - stroke engine with electric fuel cells and solar - powered air - conditioning			1
this , they promise , is not the four - wheeled object of ridicule that rolled off production lines in @entity5 from 1957 until 1991			1
this is the new trabant , or @entity12 as they 're known , an energy - efficient city car for modern drivers			1
" i think the market will be people who say the old trabant was a cool car , and people who want to have a stylish car , and want to have a green car , " @entity35 , of @entity36 , told @entity2			2
@entity36 is not a carmaker , at least not in the traditional sense			0
it makes model cars and airplanes , of the type that sit in display cabinets , not garages			0
two years ago , a member of its management team , @entity51 , decided it was time to make a miniature model of the trabant			2
@entity36 took it to the @entity10 in @entity11 in 2007 and were stunned by the response			1
" we had a special folder where people at the fair could fill out and give it back to use			0
we had about 14,000 reactions on that , and most of them , 90 percent , said ' yes , the trabant is a really cool car , let 's bring it back , ' " @entity35 said			1
@entity36 teamed up with @entity71 auto parts maker @entity70 , which has designed a prototype to be unveiled at the @entity10 in @entity11 in september			1
they hope to attract enough interest to put the car back into production			2
the early response of @entity12 enthusiasts to an electric version of their much - loved cars has been encouraging			1
" this will be an ideal vehicle to try it on , " @entity82 , who had been the president or chairman of the @entity85 @entity84 on and off for some 18 years			2
" if they go for the same type of cladding of duroplast , or western - style glass fibre , you have a light body which obviously will be an advantage for an electric car			1
" the original exterior of the cars was made from duroplast , a blend of cast - off cotton fibers from @entity99 mixed with glue			0
@entity82 bought his first trabant in the @entity102 in 1987 , two years before the fall of the @entity104			1
over the years , he 's owned around 20 of the @entity71 cars , adding " we have several restoration projects in the yard at the moment			2
" like many admirers , he appreciates the trabi 's simplicity			1
" they are basic technology			0
there is absolutely nothing that we ca n't repair ourselves			0
if we ca n't get the parts we can usually make them , " he laughed			2
" if they can do the electrical conversion , for want of a better term , in a relatively low - tech way so they keep it simple i think it could be a success , " he said			0
@entity71 filmmaker @entity128 spent four years making a documentary about the trabant			0
he became fascinated about the car 's origins as a child growing up in the @entity5 where residents faced up to a fourteen - year wait for delivery of their vehicles			1
" there was only a certain contingent , a certain amount , allowed every year , because they did n't have enough screws , they did n't have enough parts , " he said			0
for his documentary , " @entity155 , " he interviewed former @entity147 engineers and owners and found an abundance of nostalgia for the old - style vehicles , despite their association with @entity154 repression			1
" people remember it as their only partner in crime , " @entity128 said			0
" it was the one and only thing that brought them around the country			0
they were n't allowed to go far			0
this was the only vehicle they could use and it was always reliable , most times			0
" many of the cars were dumped by their owners as soon as they 'd driven them to freedom over the border from @entity175			0
@entity128 said it did n't take long for nostalgia to kick in and the first @entity12 appreciation meeting was held in 1990 , just one year after the fall of the @entity104			1
of plans for a new , eco-friendly @entity12 , @entity128 says , " " i think it 's great			2
people would probably love it , i think it will sell			0
" if the modern @entity12 fails to materialize , there 's always the option to step back in time in the original version			0
@entity190 can still be seen slowly weaving through traffic , particularly in @entity104 and @entity192 , where @entity193 leads tourists in a procession of up to six cars to local points of interest .			2

new electric @entity147 to be unveiled at @entity10 in @entity11
