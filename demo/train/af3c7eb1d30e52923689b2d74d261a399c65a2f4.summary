-- when the moment finally arrived , 86 of us stood up to utter 31 sacred words			2
i raised my right hand			2
all those years spent in public schools in @entity8 , i 'd refrained from saying the @entity9			1
it was wrong to say it when my loyalties lay elsewhere			2
but that changed with a ceremony on a july day six years ago			1
i learned lessons about the meaning of country and more importantly , about myself			2
i 'd been in @entity8 almost three decades but happily retained an @entity20 passport			1
over the years , each time it was renewed , my green card changed to pink and white but the status remained the same : permanent @entity8 resident			1
i 'd lived here so long that i felt just as much @entity8 as i did @entity20 , but i had my reasons for not taking that last formal step that made my @entity27 official			1
one was practical -- there was a matter of inheriting my father 's property in @entity32 , @entity20 , and for a long time , that process was excruciatingly painful without @entity20 citizenship			2
my father knew what a bureaucratic nightmare inheritance could be , and as long as he was alive , he encouraged me to stay an @entity20			2
the other reason i held back was far more personal			2
@entity20 does not allow dual citizenship with the @entity8 , and assuming @entity8 citizenship would effectively mean renouncing @entity20			1
that felt like betrayal , a severance with the land that gave me birth and shaped me			2
i spent a chunk of my childhood in @entity20			2
when my family finally settled in the @entity8 , i struggled to find myself			1
i learned to speak @entity50 well , even with a twinge of @entity53 drawl , some would say			2
i went to high school dances and loved my @entity55 's and even went out on dates , something i would never have done in @entity20 at that time			2
but i never felt fully accepted			2
i was always an " other " on forms that asked for race and ethnicity , before the days when @entity61 became a census category			2
in high school and college , i found myself fighting stereotypes and answering absurd questions about @entity20 , such as " do people live in grass huts ? " sometimes , i felt @entity8 simply did n't understand me and that everything would be better if i could just go back to @entity20			1
the yearning for home and family grew stronger with age , especially after my parents moved back to @entity20 in 1985			2
i felt a need to rediscover my roots , not uncommon , i suppose , among immigrant children			0
but every time i returned home to visit , i realized i could never feel fully at home in @entity20 anymore			0
a memsahib , the elders in my family joked , referring to the term for @entity86 women during colonial times			0
that , too , is not uncommon among immigrant children			0
many of us feel neither here nor there , straddling two cultures as we navigate key years of our lives			1
in my case , i was happy to go on as a citizen of one country , a resident of another			1
i paid my taxes and enjoyed all the freedoms afforded @entity8 save two things			1
i never served on a jury and more importantly , i could not vote			0
i never had an electoral say in @entity20 either because it did not allow absentee voting			0
i hailed from the world 's largest democracy and lived in the world 's most powerful one , but was unable to take part in a free society 's most essential expression			0
i always felt cheated , or worse , that i was falling short			0
in 2004 , i covered the presidential elections for an @entity115 newspaper , and after months of excitement and intrigue i was frustrated that i could not cast a ballot on @entity119			0
by then i had cleared the biggest legal hurdles in @entity20 in settling my father 's property			0
and so it happened that i sat down to fill out the necessary forms declaring my intent to become @entity8			1
i was fingerprinted , passed citizenship tests that challenged my knowledge of the @entity128 and was finally called to take the oath in july 2008			1
at the suburban @entity115 offices of the @entity131 , i scanned the room to see faces from @entity134 to @entity135			0
there were people from 38 different countries there that day for the naturalization ceremony			2
i thought back to all the people i had met in my career as a reporter , of people who fought for freedom in lands that kept them caged , and others who clawed their way to these shores to break free			1
i remembered @entity150 dissenters i had met on my trip to @entity152 , and @entity154 women who risked their lives to make things better for their little girls			0
now , all we have to do is look to the men and women of the @entity161 , who took to the streets to oust governments that kept them down			0
think of how much people risk to attain the kind of freedom we enjoy in @entity8			1
and how much people in our own country have struggled to rid our society of prejudice and persecution			2
my naturalization ceremony was testament to the @entity8 spirit			1
i looked around me and realized that this was n't just about the journeys people had made ; it was about the potential of all they could achieve in their new nation			1
i thought about the @entity8 i 'd met who worked hard , determined to achieve the @entity184 ; about how their expectations were greater than their fears			1
such was the case with @entity188 , who left behind gen. @entity190 's military rule in @entity191 and arrived here without a college degree or @entity50 skills			0
he started in construction jobs and worked his way up to become a successful businessman			0
or @entity198 , who fled the brutal dictatorship of @entity200			0
she came to @entity8 ready to fulfill her dreams			1
in @entity202 , she said , she never had that chance			0
i thought , too , about all the @entity8 i met who inspired me to carry on in the face of adversity			1
they , too , championed the @entity8 spirit			1
@entity208 lost her @entity210 home to @entity211 , resettled in @entity115 only to lose her home again in a fire			0
@entity214 persevered with a smile on her face			0
she said she had learned that it was not possessions that made a home			0
@entity221 was a young cavalry scout whose arm was blown off in a roadside bombing in @entity224			0
he returned home determined to make the best of life			0
he is the first severely wounded soldier in the wars in @entity224 and @entity154 to become an officer			0
@entity8 is filled with such stories			1
it is a nation that gives people hope			1
on that july day , i felt proud , and extremely lucky , to be a part of this land			0
i glanced at @entity236 of @entity135 , standing to my right , dressed for the occasion in a khaki suit and blue tie			0
and on my left stood my friend @entity242 , a photographer for @entity244 newspaper and a native of @entity246			0
i wondered what they were thinking as they , too , became @entity8 citizens			1
did they have the same emotions i did ? was their joy tinged with the melancholy of giving up a homeland ? my eyes welled as i began the oath			0
" i hereby declare , on oath , that i absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince , potentate , state or sovereignty , of whom or which i have heretofore been a subject or citizen ; that i will support and defend the @entity128 and laws of the @entity8 against all enemies , foreign and domestic ; that i will bear true faith and allegiance to the same			1
... " two worlds collided in my head as i drove to the @entity276 with my new certificate of citizenship so that i could register to vote in time for the 2008 presidential elections			1
that november , @entity8 made history with the election of @entity282 as its first black president			1
the election became an important part of my own history as i stepped up to a voting booth and cast a ballot for the very first time			0
since then , i 've come to think differently of my new citizenship			0
i know now that swearing allegiance to the red , white and blue gave me new nationality			0
but nothing can ever take away my identity or that of the 40 million other people living in @entity8 who were born in other countries			1
my @entity20 roots run deep , and i strive to carry with me every day the very best of two lands			0
that is , after all , what makes @entity8 great			1
