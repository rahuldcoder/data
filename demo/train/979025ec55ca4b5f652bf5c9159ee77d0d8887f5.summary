@entity0 -- anti-american sentiment in @entity4 nations may be at a historic high , but secretary of state @entity6 was the honorary recipient of more than a quarter of a million dollars in jewelry from an @entity4 leader over the past year			2
secretary of state @entity6 received gifts of jewelry , but federal law mandates they go to archives			1
@entity14 topped the @entity16 's annual inventory of gifts to top administration officials			1

earlier in the year , in january , the @entity14 king presented @entity20 a $ 147,000 emerald and diamond necklace , bracelet and earrings set			1
the @entity16 originally reported that the emerald and diamond jewelry set came from @entity34 's @entity19 , but the @entity34 government pointed out such a gift was never made by the @entity34 king			1
" no such gift was given to @entity20 from @entity41 , " the @entity34 embassy in @entity0 said in a statement			2
" we believe this must have been a mistake on the part of the @entity16			0
gifts by @entity41 to @entity48 officials are always symbolic and of little material value			0
" the @entity16 acknowledged and apologized for the error			0
" our records indicate that the @entity19 of @entity34 did not give secretary of state @entity20 the emerald and diamond and jewelry set ( ring , bracelet , necklace and earrings ) , " said @entity51 , a @entity16 spokesman			1

the first couple also received embroidered pillows with the names and pictures of the first dogs , @entity95 and ms. @entity96			0
the pillows were given to @entity77 by the wife of former @entity99 prime minister @entity98			0
the gifts range from the extravagant -- like the jewelry -- to the modest -- a $ 6 assortment of nuts and dried fruit given by the @entity105 to @entity77 -- to the downright odd , like the @entity106 given to president @entity76 by the prime minister of singapore			2
many of the gifts are related to the recipient 's post			0
