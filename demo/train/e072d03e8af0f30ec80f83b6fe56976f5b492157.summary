-- @entity1 joined @entity2 at the top of @entity5 's @entity4 after an @entity7 hat - trick blew away @entity8 in a 3 - 0 victory at the @entity10			1
the hosts ' fourth win in five league games takes them to 13 points , with only a missed penalty from @entity7 denying @entity17 's side from taking top spot outright in the @entity20 championship			2
the @entity21 became the league 's top scorer with five goals after racing to his hat - trick in just over an hour but he blazed a 75th minute spot - kick over the bar			1
@entity1 , who remain unbeaten , now share an identical record of eleven goals scored and two conceded with reigning champions @entity2 , who drew 0 - 0 at @entity31 on tuesday			1
@entity8 -- whose @entity33 striker @entity32 earned praise after admitting to match officials that he had used his hand when bundling the ball home early on -- suffered their second loss in as many games after starting their campaign with three straight wins			0
meanwhile , @entity44 relieved some of the pressure on embattled coach @entity47 when beating ten - man @entity48 2 - 0 at the @entity49 to move tenth in the table			1
@entity47 watched from the sidelines as he served a touchline ban issued after he made heated protests to officials during sunday 's defeat at @entity57 but he would have been delighted to see striker @entity58 grab a double -- and was further boosted by the return of @entity62 's @entity61 after a month - long injury			0
both @entity47 and @entity44 went into the game knowing that a win was imperative after defeats in their opening games at the @entity49 -- against @entity68 and @entity69 -- had led to the club 's worst home start to a season in over 80 years			1
the win also meant that one of @entity44 and @entity75 , who share the @entity49 , had finally won a game -- at the tenth time of asking -- after the installation of a new partially - synthetic pitch over the summer			0
having suffered a shock home defeat against @entity82 on sunday , @entity75 responded by moving up to fourth after winning 2 - 0 at @entity83 , thanks to goals from @entity86 and @entity87			2
in the @entity20 capital , @entity68 protected their unbeaten record as they recovered from going behind to a first half @entity93 goal to draw 1 - 1 at @entity94 and take third spot , three points behind the leaders			0
elsewhere , @entity99 beat @entity69 2 - 1 , @entity98 drew 1 - 1 with @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity57 played out a goalless draw while @entity103 beat ten - man @entity105 1 - 0 thanks to a late strike from @entity108			2
there was just one game in @entity111 where @entity112 went second in @entity113 , and six points clear of city rivals @entity115 , after winning 4 - 2 at @entity116			1
@entity118 striker @entity117 scored twice to overtake @entity119 at the top of @entity113 's scoring charts , with @entity112 's thirteen points now just two fewer than @entity123			2
in @entity33 , @entity124 and @entity125 kept @entity126 among the league leaders , scoring or assisting in all four goals as the team beat @entity130 4 - 1 at home			0
@entity133 top the @entity134 after winning their opening five games , but @entity126 moved third as @entity125 's brace and one from the @entity139 took their points tally to ten for the season			0
@entity142 moved out of the bottom three after drawing 2 - 2 at @entity143 , with former @entity145 midfielder @entity144 opening the scoring for the visitors .			0

@entity1 beat visitors @entity8 3 - 0 to go joint top of @entity4 with reigning champions @entity2
@entity7 strikes a hat - trick to take his season 's league tally to five , one more than @entity31 's @entity156
@entity44 relieve pressure on coach @entity47 with a 2 - 0 win at home to @entity48
in @entity111 , @entity112 win 4 - 2 at @entity116 to go second in @entity113 and six points clear of city rivals @entity115
