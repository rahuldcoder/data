-- there are many lessons to be learned from our experiences before and after 9/11			1
one lesson is that when you get a wake - up call ... @entity8 ! we received many wake - up calls from @entity11 before 9/11			1
february 1993 : the first @entity13 attack by @entity14 , @entity15 ( the blind @entity16 ) and its financier , @entity17			2
six people were killed and more than 1,000 were injured			2
june 1993 : @entity15 and others were charged in a plot to bomb @entity23 landmarks including the @entity24 , @entity25 and the @entity27 's @entity23 office			1
october 1993 : @entity29 - trained followers kill 18 and wound 73 @entity31 military officers in @entity32 , @entity33 , now known as " @entity34			1
" august 1998 : the bombings of @entity31 embassies in @entity37 and @entity38 leave 12 americans and hundreds of others dead			2
the @entity27 places @entity11 on its @entity41			2
october 2000 : the bombing of the @entity43 in @entity44 kills 17 sailors			2
september 11 , 2001 : the coordinated attack included four hijacked planes , two of which were flown into each @entity13 tower and a third into the @entity51			0
the fourth crashed in a @entity53 field when passengers heroically stormed the cockpit			0
in the summer of 2001 , the declared priorities of the @entity57 were guns and gangs			0
an @entity27 request for hundreds of additional agents , analysts and linguists for its counterterrorism program was rejected and returned on september 10			0
since 9/11 , we have spent trillions of dollars fighting two wars and reorganizing the federal law enforcement and intelligence community			1
significant enhancements were made to existing agencies , and the @entity73 , including the @entity74 , was created			0
are we safer today ? i agree with experts who believe that a large sophisticated and coordinated attack such as 9/11 is extremely unlikely			1
the decimation of @entity29 , the killing of @entity11 , the monitoring of the global financial network and international communications among terrorists , greater international sharing of information and public awareness make it nearly impossible to duplicate the scale and scope of the 9/11 plan			1
the @entity31 has now received " specific , credible but unconfirmed " information that one or more vehicles containing explosives may be used for an attack in @entity23 and / or @entity94 this weekend			0
this reporting makes no mention of a large scale attack using aircraft			1
it is considered credible because accurate information has been previously obtained from this source			0
however , it is unconfirmed because the terrorists have not been identified and the actual attack plan has not been verified			0
i offer a lesson from history to support my belief that smaller attacks will continue for decades			1
although @entity110 died in his @entity112 bunker in april 1945 , " @entity113 " lives on : in 1977 , the @entity114 , a neo-nazi group , held demonstrations in the @entity117 area			0
" the @entity123 " by @entity124 was first published in 1978 and is considered the inspiration for the creation of numerous groups and the commission of many crimes			1
these include the 1984 murder of @entity129 radio talk show host @entity127 and the 1995 attack on the @entity131 in @entity132			0
this year , on january 19 , a bomb was placed on the martin luther king day parade route in @entity135 , @entity94			0
a man with past ties to a @entity139 group , the @entity138 , has pleaded guilty			0
if these events still occur 66 years after @entity110 's death , what can we expect during the next 66 years following @entity11 's death ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity147 .			1

@entity149 : lesson of 9/11 is to *pay* attention to threats
he says there were numerous *warnings* of @entity29 's *danger*
@entity159 says likelihood of large - scale attacks like 9/11 are slim
he says smaller attacks could continue for decades
