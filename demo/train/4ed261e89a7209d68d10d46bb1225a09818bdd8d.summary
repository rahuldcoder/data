-- the fiery crash that @entity2 witnessed last year prompted her to become a leading critic of the @entity5 's safety record			1
the car driving behind her was rear - ended by a truck on a highway near @entity10 , @entity11 , in october			0
the 1998 @entity5 crumpled like an accordion when a tractor - trailer hit it at more than 60 mph			0
all three occupants were alive after the impact , @entity2 says			1
but two of them died in the subsequent fire			0
" the whole thing had gone up in flames , " she said			0
" and we watched those people burn to death			0
" desperate to help , her father , @entity25 , ran to the @entity26 and broke the windows with his bare hands			0
@entity29 recall controversy : what 's next he pulled @entity33 out alive			1
but @entity34 , his mother , could not be saved			0
nor could the other young passenger , @entity35			0
" he was hollering and screaming and waving his hands , " @entity25 recalled			0
" and his head -- the back of his head was burning			0
" @entity25 says the wreck was a searing experience			0
" it was days before i could sleep over 10 minutes of time , " he said			2
but were these tragic fatalities in any way related to the @entity26 's design ? or were they simply the unfortunate outcome of an unsurvivable crash ? @entity29 , which owns @entity26 , says that the model of the @entity51 meets safety standards			1
@entity2 says the people would not have died if the fuel tank of the @entity5 was not so far back toward the rear of the vehicle			1
" they can take another vehicle and run into the back of that vehicle up to 70 miles an hour , and it does n't catch fire , " she said , " because there is n't a gas tank right there			2
" but @entity29 sees it differently			1
the company says statistics show that @entity26 models such as the @entity5 are no worse or better in rear - end crashes than similar vehicles by other makers from that period			2
" the 1998 @entity51 meets and exceeds all applicable federal safety standards , " the company says in a statement , " including the stringent requirements of the applicable @entity75 301 -- the standard by which a vehicle 's fuel system design is evaluated in the @entity80 -- and has an excellent safety record over many registered vehicle years			1
" @entity2 has mounted a personal campaign against the @entity26 design			1
her online petition has drawn more than 100,000 signatures , and she has spent thousands of dollars of her own money to buy billboards criticizing the company			0
but @entity29 maintains that the root cause of the @entity10 fatalities was the crash impact			1
" this tragedy was the result of a violent , high energy crash caused by a distracted tractor - trailer truck driver who rammed into the back of the 1998 @entity51 at highway speed , " it says			2
in a rare rebuff , @entity29 has refused a @entity102 request for a recall of 2.7 million suvs			1
the government agency says the gas tank design used in 1993 to 2004 @entity107 and 2002 to 2007 @entity108 is unsafe			2
@entity29 says that the design of the gas tank is commonly accepted in many other vehicles			1
it 's the first time since 1996 that an automaker has fully challenged a recall demand from the safety agency			1
@entity0 's @entity116 contributed to this report .			2

@entity2 says the fiery crash occurred because of the *placement* of the fuel tank
@entity29 rejects request to recall 2.7 million vehicles
it 's the first time since 1996 that an automaker has fully challenged a recall demand
