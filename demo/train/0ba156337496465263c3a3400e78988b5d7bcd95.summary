-- @entity4 golfer and world number six , @entity5 , was kicked out of the first @entity7 play - off on wednesday after missing his tee - off time by oversleeping			1
@entity5 , 40 , told the official website of @entity9 that he set an alarm on his cell phone which ran out of power overnight and failed to wake him up			1
" the hotel had power ... but somehow my phone died			1
i never use a backup because i just figure if the phone is charged , i 'm good to go , " @entity5 said			1
after waking five minutes before he was due to start playing , @entity5 made a dash from his hotel to the course but failed to get to the 11th tee of the @entity23 tournament in @entity24 in time			1
injury or family emergency are the only reasons that excuse a player 's absence , consequently , @entity5 will miss thursday 's planned round with countryman @entity31 and @entity32 of @entity33			2
" the rules are rules			0
no matter what tournament it was , i would be upset			0
but i 'm more upset because it 's this one , " @entity5 added			2
it means @entity5 misses an opportunity to cement his third - place playoff standing in the race to be crowned champion			1
according to the playoff scenarios he could see his position slide to 19th before the @entity45 next week in @entity46			0
one consolation to @entity5 is that he already has enough points for the 30 - man season - ending @entity49 to be staged in @entity50 in september			1
@entity51 , the tour 's vice president of rules and competition told the @entity9 website : " it is unfortunate			2
knowing @entity5 as i do and we all do , he handled it extremely professionally and put all of the blame on himself			0
" he is a fan favorite and everybody likes him			0
he is a really good guy , but my hands are tied			0
i am sure he will recover quite nicely next week and jump right in there again			0
" @entity5 is due to win his seventh @entity66 cap against @entity67 at @entity68 in october .			0
