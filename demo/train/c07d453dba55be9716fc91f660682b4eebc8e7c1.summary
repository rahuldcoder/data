-- " captain @entity9 , " his wife and two sons planned with other militia members to kill a law enforcement official to draw the officer 's colleagues to the funeral , authorities say			1
then , according to an indictment unsealed monday , the militia planned to attack the funeral procession to kick off its war against the @entity16 government			1
members of the @entity9 militia , whose web site says it is preparing for end times to " keep the testimony of @entity22 alive , " have been indicted on five counts , including seditious conspiracy and attempting to use weapons of mass destruction			1
federal authorities allege militia members had declared war against law enforcement and " foot soldiers " of the federal government			1
they had conducted " military - style training " in @entity35 , @entity36 , about 35 miles northwest of @entity37 , @entity38 , since 2008 , the indictment said			0
the group 's web site outlines the militia 's philosophy : " @entity22 wanted us to be ready to defend ourselves using the sword and stay alive using equipment			1
the only thing on @entity48 to save the testimony and those who follow it are the members of the testimony , till the return of @entity22 in the clouds			1
" the group 's leader , @entity55 -- aka " @entity55 " or " @entity57 " -- allegedly planned to kill a law enforcement officer to instigate a war against the @entity16 government			1
in a phone interview monday with @entity10 , @entity60 , @entity61 's brother , said he was n't aware that his sibling was a member of the @entity9 militia nor did he believe @entity55 would set out to harm police officers			1
" no , i do n't believe that would ever happen , " he said			0
" that takes a very dark person			0
" @entity60 said his brother , whom he said he has n't seen in months , is employed in a factory and " works like everyone else			0
" the indictment alleges that killing a law enforcement official would be just the beginning : " as a consequence of this act , law enforcement officers from throughout the nation would be drawn to and gather in the @entity82 of @entity36 for the funeral , " the indictment said			1
" according to the plan , the @entity57 would then attack law enforcement vehicles during the funeral procession with improvised explosive devices with explosively formed projectiles			2
" the federal conspiracy charges say the militia devised several options for killing a law enforcement officer : after a traffic stop , during an ambush in a rural community , or by " luring a member of law enforcement with a false 911 emergency call			0
" the militia also considered killing a law enforcement official and family members at home , the indictment said			2
the intention of the group was that such acts " would intimidate and demoralize law enforcement , diminishing their ranks and rendering them ineffective , " the indictment said			2
the militia would then retreat to a rally point where it would " wage war against the government and be prepared to defend in - depth with trip - wired and command - detonated anti-personnel improvised explosive devices			2
" @entity57 members believe , according to the indictment , that their fight would " serve as a catalyst for a more widespread uprising against the government			1
" the government alleges that , in preparation for such an uprising , the militia acquired firearms , ammunition , explosives , uniforms , communication devices , vehicles and medical supplies			2
the militia also conducted military - style drills , including explosives and firearms training , as well as " close - quarter battle drills			0
" members also prepared defensive fighting positions , including " ambush kill zones " and storage bunkers , the indictment said			2
on february 6 , @entity55 and several others intended to travel to @entity138 to meet with other militia groups , but weather conditions prevented them from reaching their destination			0
however , according to the indictment , @entity55 contacted " a person he believed capable of manufacturing destructive devices to provide him with four anti-personnel improvised explosive devices to take with them to the summit			0
" the indictment alleges that @entity55 identified law enforcement officers near his residence -- and one in particular -- as potential targets			1
@entity55 announced a covert reconnaissance exercise that was scheduled for next month , the indictment said , adding that " anyone who happened upon the exercise who did not acquiesce to @entity57 demands could be killed			0
" the @entity57 web site 's main page , viewed monday by @entity10 , announced an april 24 training exercise and asked visitors to " contact headquarters immediately			1
" @entity55 and six co-conspirators engaged in training as recently as february 20 , the indictment said , and each used at least one firearm			0
@entity16 attorney @entity168 explained the federal raid 's timing in a statement announcing the indictment			0
" because the @entity57 had planned a covert reconnaissance operation for april which had the potential of placing an unsuspecting member of the public at risk , the safety of the public and of the law enforcement community demanded intervention at this time			0
