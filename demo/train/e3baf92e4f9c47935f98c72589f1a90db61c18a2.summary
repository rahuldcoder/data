-- this year 's critically acclaimed films take audiences from places like slave plantations in the @entity5 , to packed @entity6 as @entity7 steps up to bat , and to inner - city public housing on a scorching summer day			1
while set in various eras and depicting diverse stories , many of the films on the short list for the 2013 awards season show an emerging trend ; @entity18 is making movies about the black experience in @entity21			1
this year alone there have been at least half a dozen movies portraying @entity25 narratives , including @entity27 ' " @entity26 , " " @entity28 , " " the inevitable defeat of @entity30 and @entity31 , " " @entity32 , " " 42 " and " 12 years a slave , " which hits theaters october 18			1
" certainly 2013 has been a banner year with regards to the number of films that feature @entity25 themes , " said @entity35 , co-founder of the @entity36			1
" those films all really arrive at the threshold in terms of the quality that will seriously put them in the running for @entity48 consideration			2
" not only do the movies portray the @entity25 - @entity25 experience , but they 're also created from the ground up by today 's most prominent black filmmakers and actors			1
oscar - winner @entity54 , who played the lead role in " the @entity57 , " says the trend in @entity18 allows for a more diverse storytelling			1
" there are so many projects where people are being able to have their voices heard , " @entity54 said			0
" i think that 's hopefully going to continue to expand in the @entity25 - @entity25 community ... and all the voices can be heard in the tapestry of who we are as people			1
" @entity18 has not seen such an emphasis on @entity25 storylines since the 1980s and ' 90s , with @entity74 and @entity76 's street dramas like " @entity77 " and " @entity78			1
" opinion : why you should see ' @entity81 ' " they were speaking about what was happening in the present day , " said @entity82 , professor of @entity83 at @entity84 at @entity85 and independent filmmaker			1
" speaking to a lot of gang violence , debunking stereotypes about young black men in the hood , speaking to racism going on not only in @entity95 but all over the world			0
" by the early 2000s , the @entity25 blockbuster took a turn with film series like " @entity100 " and " @entity101			1
" but in 2009 , @entity18 rekindled a fascination with @entity25 storylines , with movies like " @entity104 , " " @entity105 " and " precious			1
" subsequently , " @entity107 " ( 2011 ) , " @entity108 " ( 2012 ) and " @entity109 " ( 2013 ) hit mainstream theaters			1
" i think the @entity25 attitude has changed with regards to going to see films that perhaps feature all @entity25 casts or that tell @entity25 - @entity25 stories , " @entity35 said			1
" @entity21 are more open to paying their 10 - 15 dollars and taking in those experiences			2
" some credit the shift in @entity18 to @entity117 , citing president @entity119 's 2009 inauguration as the spark that reignited interest in the @entity25 - @entity25 experience , from slavery to the @entity124			1
" people have talked about the ' @entity119 effect , ' " said @entity125 , star of " 12 years a slave			0
" " if people are interested and they want to go and see movies that have diversity or are about different things in that way , then in a way that allows them to be created more			2
" @entity125 's " 12 years a slave " co-star @entity136 agrees that the election of the country 's first @entity25 - @entity25 president , along with other timely events , helped trigger universal consciousness			1
" we 're dealing with 150 years since the abolition of slavery , " he said			0
" there are a lot of anniversaries at the moment , ( the assassination of ) @entity151 we have a black president in @entity21			0
all of those things perhaps contribute			0
" yet @entity82 warns that filmmakers must be cautious when focusing on historical narratives , saying too much emphasis on historical events minimizes issues that many african - americans deal with today			2
" when it comes to african - americans , it 's easier to talk about it like it happened , not like it 's happening , " he said			2
" that can create a safe dialogue because it happened 50 , 100 , 150 years ago			0
it allows us to look at it from a safe distance , but sometimes i think it 's irresponsible because these issues are continuing to happen			0
" that 's why i want to see both sides of the narrative , " he continued			0
" the historical side and the current side			0
we 've come a long way , but we still have a long way to go			0
" @entity183 is one filmmaker who wanted to address the issues that contemporary african - americans face with his movie " @entity28 , " which chronicles the 2009 shooting of black 22 - year - old @entity188 by a @entity190 police officer			2
" that 's something that i deal with on a day - to - day basis , losing friends to gun violence , " the 26 - year - old director said at the movie 's premiere			1
" i 've seen lives cut short too soon , whether it be police - involved shootings or whether it be black - on - black crime			2
" what gets glossed over is that we 're human beings , too , like everybody else , young @entity25 - @entity25 males			1
i hope the people can see a little bit of themselves in the character if they sit down and watch the film			2
" similarly , " the inevitable defeat of @entity30 and @entity31 " illuminates the struggles of people living in the inner - city projects , following 13 - year - old mister ( @entity213 ) as he tries to survive through a stifling @entity214 summer after being abandoned by his mother ( @entity215 )			2
" @entity30 's journey is not often heard , " actor @entity217 said at the movie 's premiere			0
" what he does is he just shows the humanity of who he is as a young black child , and you 're able to see his humanity , his heart , beyond his skin color			0
" opinion : why ' the @entity57 ' is groundbreaking more than simply stories on the streets , this year 's batch of movies also represent @entity25 - @entity25 family life on the big screen			1
@entity235 revealed she was very drawn to the cast of " @entity26 " because of the central portrayal of the @entity25 - @entity25 familyâ € ” doing typical things , like dropping a son off to college and finishing one another 's sentences			1
" one of the reasons why i love this film and wanted to be a part of it is the tenderness between the husband and wife , the tenderness and nurturing nature of the middle - class family , " @entity235 said			1
when it comes to depicting black family life , @entity35 said the film industry has been slow to catch up to television , referencing sitcoms like " @entity260 " in the 1980s			2
and some argue that @entity18 still needs to stop putting african - americans in roles of servitude , like slaves and servants , and start casting them more often as regular characters in mainstream movies			1
" critics do n't look at a film and notice that every one of the lead roles is white , " said @entity269 , author of " @entity270 " and editor at " @entity273 " magazine			2
" we 're taught it 's the norm , and it 's not the norm			0
we believe that we can have really good films that have majority white casts ; why ca n't we believe that we can have a majority black , @entity283 , or @entity285 cast , and have a good film as well ? " however , some point out that the idea of a black renaissance in the film industry can be simplistic , and argue that in @entity18 the most important color is n't black or white , but green			1
filmmaking is a business , and ultimately diverse story lines in mainstream theaters depend on funding and subsequent success at the box office			0
" i do n't think it 's because there 's any age of enlightenment , " said @entity299 , who is in " 12 years a slave			0
" " i think it 's just serendipitous for those individuals that fight to get funding for the stories they want to get told ; it just sort of happened that way right now			0
it will go just as dry as it ever was shortly			0
" nonetheless , the resurgence in movies that focus on @entity25 - @entity25 stories is apparent , with more than a dozen such films opening in the past four years			1
even more , like " @entity318 " and " @entity319 , " are set for release in 2014			0
" the commercial and critical success of these films is showing , " @entity269 said			0
" just like there are audiences for the various ' @entity328 ' movies , there are people who want to see these slices of wider @entity21			2
" the push for more diversity is coming from within @entity18 as well			0
@entity333 , another actor in " 12 years a slave , " said she looks forward to the day when films that feature @entity25 - @entity25 stories will no longer be an anomaly			1
meanwhile , " @entity26 " director @entity27 is reportedly planning production for an action movie starring an interracial gay couple			0
" they have to fund those movies " said @entity343 , one of the stars of " @entity28			2
" " you have to create a level playing field for women , for people of color , gay , straight , whatever			0
we just need to do it			0
" ' the @entity57 ' reflects @entity21 's racial conversations			0

in 2013 , half a dozen movies portraying the @entity25 - @entity25 experience have been released
the trend may signify a renaissance of @entity25 - @entity25 film
but some actors look forward to the day when the trend is not an anomaly
