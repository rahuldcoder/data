@entity0 -- a report from an @entity6 advocacy group based on what it says is the testimony of several unnamed @entity6 soldiers accuses the @entity6 military of intentionally putting @entity11 civilians at risk during its recent operation in @entity14			1
@entity11 @entity15 , left , shows wednesday how he says @entity6 soldiers used him as a human shield			1
the report , released wednesday from a group called " @entity20 " -- which includes former @entity6 soldiers -- has been dismissed by the @entity6 military as slanderous			1
in the 110 - page report , the group said some of the 26 soldiers interviewed said they used @entity11 as human shields during the military 's more than two - week long ground operation in @entity14 earlier this year			1
" in some cases a civilian would be forced to walk in front of soldier while the soldier places his gun barrel on the civilian 's shoulder , " the report states			2
other soldiers talk about destroying buildings even though the structures posed no direct threat			0
they also said that white phosphorus was used in densely populated areas and describe the rules of engagement as " permissive			2
" phosphorus shells can be used to create a smokescreen for troops			0
in creating the diversion , the element ignites when exposed to oxygen and can cause severe burns			0
international law calls on militaries to limit the use white phosphorus in civilian areas			1
other organizations , including the @entity59 ' @entity58 , @entity60 and the @entity62 - based @entity61 , have criticized the @entity6 military 's conduct in @entity14			1
@entity6 has questioned the legitimacy of those claims , as well			2
the stories presented by breaking the silence are anonymous accounts which @entity1 can not independently verify			0
the group said that the soldiers were not willing to speak with the media			2
in response to the report 's allegations , the @entity6 military said it complied with international law on all fronts			1
the advocacy group said many of the soldiers interviewed in its report are still serving and fear repercussions if they reveal their identity , and they did not take their complaints up the chain of command			1
the @entity6 military has rejected the report , saying the anonymous nature of the testimonies means they lack credibility			1
" there are no factual details , no places , no names of incidents in specific houses on a specific date , " military spokesman lt. col. @entity94 said			0
" i would be more than happy to be provided with these details and i will be able to investigate them			0
" the @entity6 military conducted its own investigation into soldiers ' actions during @entity107 , its 22 - day military offensive in january against the militant group @entity108 in an effort to end ongoing rocket attacks			1
it found that @entity6 forces " operated in accordance with international law " although there were a few incidents in which " intelligence or operational errors " occurred			2
fighting left more than 1,400 @entity11 dead according to officials in @entity14 , while @entity6 put that death toll closer to 1,100 , saying more than 70 percent of those killed were @entity108 militants			1
thirteen @entity6 were killed during the operation , including three civilians			1
@entity6 defense minister @entity125 , responding to the report which was widely publicized in @entity6 , said the criticism was " misplaced and misdirected			2
" " if someone has a criticism , or information or conclusions about @entity132 ( @entity132 ) actions , they should bring them to me , as minister of defense of the state of @entity6 , and to the @entity6 government that instructed the @entity132 to restore quiet to the communities in the south , " @entity125 said			2
" the @entity132 is the most moral army in the world and it operates according to the highest ethical code			0
" @entity1 did independently obtain corroborating detail on one anonymous claim in the report			0
@entity14 resident @entity145 told @entity1 earlier this week that he was used as a human shield by @entity6 soldiers during the recent @entity14 military operation			1
his description of his experience closely matched an account given in the @entity20 report			0
" he was holding with all his strength like this and with his heavy machine gun on the other shoulder , " said @entity145 , who demonstrated how the soldier walked behind him as they approached his neighbors ' homes			0
the @entity6 military would not comment on whether @entity11 were used as human shields in @entity14 , saying only that there are dozens of ongoing internal investigations into individual soldier conduct			1
@entity145 , who lives in @entity167 outside @entity168 , said he was forced to search his neighbors ' homes this way for about a week , under heavy fire			0
he said he was also given a hammer and told to break through his neighbors ' walls			0
" i felt like a dead man walking , " he said			0
" i was walking and praying to @entity176 and thought this is what death is like			0
