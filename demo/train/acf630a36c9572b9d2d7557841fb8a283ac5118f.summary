@entity0 , @entity1 -- her gloves held high , @entity6 dances in the middle of a blue boxing ring			1
eyes focused straight ahead , she unleashes a flurry of thudding jabs and powerful hooks			2
it 's here , inside this small , dark gym at @entity16 in @entity0 , where @entity6 , the @entity1 female welterweight champion , comes to train twice a day			1
she has n't had a competitive fight for a year but she 's working hard to stay at the top of her game before a big title match in august			2
" i 'm looking forward to this fight , " says @entity6 , who is set to defend her title for the third time			2
" it 's a very tough fight because i 'll be defending what is mine and she also wants my title , " she adds			2
" i 'm training very hard because i need to defend this title			2
" read this : is @entity33 's greatest boxer ? there 's a lot at stake if @entity37 loses next month			2
boxing is her main source of income , but with no sponsors or manager , fights are rare			1
in fact , she only gets to fight about once a year , and though she 's set to take home some $ 5,000 -- win or lose -- for the august match , she ca n't afford to lose her title because that 's what attracts challengers and ultimately brings money			2
yet it 's not all about the money			2
@entity6 says boxing has also given her purpose whilst growing up in @entity56 , a notoriously dangerous inner city neighborhood of @entity0			1
" it did change my life a lot , " says @entity6 , who did n't finish school and never got to meet her father			1
" it kept me strict			2
it 's a challenging sport ; it 's a very strict sport , " adds the champion			0
" it kept me from bad things -- from drugs , from bad friends , having lots of boyfriends			0
" but @entity6 is not the only one to have benefited from the @entity16			1
built in what used to be a gas station , the gym has been a haven for many youngsters in this densely populated part of @entity0 , known for its high poverty and crime rates			1
after school , local boys flock to the gym to learn the basics of boxing -- how to move , jab and defend			1
no fee is required as the goal is to keep the young ones off the streets and out of trouble			0
" the @entity16 has done a lot for the community , " says @entity6 , whose wins inside the boxing ropes have made her a local star			1
" it has saved the community , it has saved @entity56 , " she adds			1
" @entity56 is not a good place but this gym has produced a lot of boxers , it has produced a lot of champions			1
we always go outside to look for younger stars , younger children ; we keep them away from drugs ; we keep them away from doing wrongs ; we keep them away from walking over the street , walking around , do n't know what they 're looking for			0
" we always go outside and look for them ; we bring them inside the gym and then we train them			1
" the club was started by @entity113 , a former boxer who 's been with @entity6 since the very beginning of her career , training her since she was just nine years old			0
@entity113 himself began boxing to avoid a life of crime			1
by the age of 20 he was fighting professionally across @entity1			0
yet his career came to an abrupt end seven years later after a brutal robbery left him with a limp and damaged eye			0
" i was very sad , " recalls @entity113			0
" i had no career			0
i ca n't do anything when i 'm crippled			0
but @entity126 listened to me			0
" his dreams shattered , @entity113 realized he would never be able to take part in professional matches again			0
but if he could n't box , he could at lease use his skills to train others			0
starting @entity16 , he says , has brought purpose back to his life			1
and the gym is now also bringing hope to others in the neighborhood			1
" i grew up here in @entity56 , " says the powerfully built but softly spoken coach			1
" i do n't want them to be in the street like i was , " he adds			0
" you know sometimes kids , they can get bored ... in the house , so we want them to get out and come here to spend their day			0
when they get home they are tired			0
they will forget about doing stupid things outside			0
they come here and enjoy themselves and then they go home to sleep			0
" read this : playground gets kids back in the swing back in the gym , @entity6 continues her rigorous training regime by pounding a punch bag , her hands wrapped in tape			1
she says she is determined to work hard to make it far in her own career and also impact the next generation of @entity56 's boxing hopefuls			1
" i 'm hoping that one day i 'll be a successful boxer , a trainer , a promoter so that i can promote other youngsters , " she says			1
" so that i can put them somewhere so that they can not suffer like i have suffered			0
so i 'd love one day to be a promoter , to promote other children , to put them somewhere , to make them something one day			0
