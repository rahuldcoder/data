-- a drug widely used to treat mild alzheimer 's disease appears to provide no benefit to this group of early stage patients , according to a new analysis of previously conducted research			1
@entity8 , also known by its brand name , @entity8 , is approved by the @entity11 only for moderate - to - severe cases of @entity13 's , although doctors often prescribe it " off - label " for milder cases of the disease			1
" we conclude that there is a lack of efficacy in mild @entity13 , " says the lead researcher , @entity19 , @entity20 , a professor of psychiatry , neurology , and gerontology at the @entity24 , in @entity25			1
" we think physicians , patients , and caregivers should simply know this			0
" pairing memantine with a cholinesterase inhibitor , a type of drug that prevents the breakdown of neurotransmitters involved in memory , has become a standard treatment for mild alzheimer 's disease , but this study " clearly flies in the face " of that approach , says @entity46 , @entity47 , the chief medical and scientific officer of the @entity49 , a research and advocacy organization based in @entity51			1
@entity0 : 25 signs and symptoms of @entity13 's disease people with mild @entity13 have impaired short - and long - term memory and typically experience difficulty with tasks such as paying bills , according to the @entity49			1
those with moderate disease may have trouble remembering their address or phone number and can become confused about the day of the week or their whereabouts			2
in 2003 , the @entity11 approved memantine for moderate - to - severe alzheimer 's disease , but two years later the agency rejected an application from the manufacturer , @entity70 , to expand the approval to mild @entity13			1
the drug has nevertheless remained popular for that purpose			0
nearly one - fifth of all people with mild @entity13 's received the drug in 2006 , and the rates may be far higher in some hospitals and practices , according to the study , which appears in the journal @entity80			1
many neurologists -- 40 percent , by one estimate -- even prescribe the drug for mild cognitive impairment , a condition that may or may not progress to full - blown dementia			2
@entity0 : 9 foods that may help save your memory @entity19 and his colleagues reanalyzed data from three clinical trials that included 431 patients with mild alzheimer 's disease and 697 with moderate @entity13			1
the trials were originally sponsored by @entity70 , but the new analysis was funded by grants from the @entity98 and other non-industry sources			0
( @entity19 has served as a consultant for @entity70			0
) patients with mild @entity13 who took memantine showed no improvement in mental function and their ability to handle everyday tasks ( such as bathing and dressing ) compared with those who took placebo , either within any one trial or when all of the data were combined			1
the drug did appear to be slightly more effective for moderate @entity13			2
patients taking memantine continued to experience mental decline while on the drug , but less so than patients taking a placebo			0
even in this group , however , the evidence for memantine 's effectiveness was " meager , " the researchers concluded			0
@entity0 : half of @entity13 's cases misdiagnosed " none of the studies individually showed an effect , " @entity19 says			1
" it was only when all three studies were added up together that we could see an effect on some outcomes , and [ it was ] very small			0
" the findings do n't mean that memantine is ineffective for all patients , @entity134 says			0
" there 's a great deal of variation from patient to patient , so whatever you see in a clinical trial is just the average of whatever that is , " he says			0
some people may experience " a robust benefit " from the combination of memantine and a cholinesterase inhibitor , he adds , while " some get none at all			2
" there is no cure for @entity13 's			2
medications sometimes help with symptoms but ca n't actually reverse the course of the disease , which may be why doctors are willing to prescribe drugs even when their effectiveness is unproven , @entity19 says			0
@entity0 : alzheimer 's disease -- should i take medicines ? patients with mild alzheimer 's disease who are already taking a cholinesterase inhibitor often ask , " is n't there more that can be done ? " @entity19 explains			1
" @entity8 is one other thing that can be done			2
part of it is hopefulness			0
the drug may not be indicated for mild @entity13 , but what 's the cost ? " @entity8 has very few side effects , he adds , but @entity13 's is devastating			1
@entity179 , @entity20 , the director of geriatric psychiatry at @entity181 , in @entity182 , says that while the new study will " make people more appropriately cautious , " it is n't likely to change doctors ' prescribing practices			0
