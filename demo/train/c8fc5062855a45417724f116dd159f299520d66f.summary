-- it 's a woman 's most intimate piece of apparel and many women will admit that shopping for one can be a nightmare			2
one company is using technology to take the guess work out of buying the perfect bra			2
@entity10 and her company , @entity11 , are using data to build a better bra in a smarter way			1
@entity15 , founder of the @entity17 - based company which launched in 2012 , spoke to @entity18 about how to avoid awkward fittings			1
@entity0 : how does your online bra fitting service work ? @entity10 : a @entity11 woman comes to the site and she actually takes a very simple quiz with illustrations			1
we ask questions , like what is the shape of your breast , what size bra do you currently wear			2
while she 's going through that , our algorithm and technology is doing a bunch of really complicated things behind the scenes , drumming up the exact recommendations and best matches for this woman			2
as soon as she reaches what we call her ' personal shop ' , all she sees are the sizes and styles of bras that are the best match for her			1
she then orders her bras from us and can try them on at home			2
and then , we collect even more data from her when she tells us which she likes and fit her best , and which she 's going to return			2
the fit quiz is our way to size women into the perfect bra for them , without any measuring tape , any photos , or any fitting rooms			1
@entity0 : more than 1 million women have taken the fit quiz			1
what has your data found ? ml : we translate the data into a ' true spectrum ' -- a way for women to understand the results of their quiz			1
when we looked at 22 million pieces of data about a woman 's body and her life , we discovered something really extraordinary			2
first of all , we were expecting a couple of hundred different body types			0
we actually found over 6,000 different body types , each nuanced and each different in a unique way			0
the fit quiz and algorithm successfully fits eight in 10 women			1
@entity0 : some women may have concerns about buying something as personal as a bra online			1
how will you remove the risk factor ? ml : after a woman 's first purchase , we may not get it right the first time			0
we may only get one in five right , or two in five right			0
and she may keep those			0
but she 'll tell us what did n't work about the other ones she returned			0
and of course , we do free shipping and free returns , so that ensures that the whole equation is risk - free			0
we take that data from her and we actually refine the selections in her shop , so that her recommendations get better and better throughout time			1
@entity0 : how can your service change the way we shop ? ml : what we 're doing with the algorithm and the data is a complete innovation in the intimate apparel space			1
and intimate apparel is a massive market			0
but what we 're actually doing can be applied to all of apparel and in fact all of shopping			0
we 're not just telling you how many blue bras have been sold , which is what old retail would do			1
we 're doing something completely different and new			0
we 're telling you who is buying that blue bra and not only that , but why they 're buying the bra			0
we 're in the business of deciphering what women want , and when you know what women want , you can actually change all of shopping			0
watch : bra helps fight cancer			0
