-- despite being an 18 - time world - record holder , @entity2 swimmer @entity1 is determined to win more medals and break more world records			1
but @entity7 is not your average ambitious sportswoman			2
she is 99 years old and only took up swimming when she was in her early 80s			2
" i do n't care about my age , " says @entity1			1
" i ca n't believe i 'm 99			2
i still feel i like challenging everything			2
" her coach is also full of praise for @entity7 , saying she is " the type who just does n't want to be defeated and is strongly determined to win more gold medals , world records			0
" see also : the ancient forests of @entity19 , @entity2 's eco-paradise @entity7 is among a growing number of elderly @entity2 who not only challenge but also shatter stereotypes of what aging means in the country			1
@entity2 's demographic crisis is well - known : around one quarter of the @entity2 population -- 31.86 million -- are 65 or older , according to government figures published in september , a record high			1
it is estimated there are over 54,000 centenarians , a 6 % increase from 2012			0
with the world 's longest life expectancy ( 84 years ) , and one of the lowest birthrates , @entity2 is expected to see sales of adult diapers overtake those of baby diapers by 2020			1
however not all senior citizens are enjoying retirement			1
with 1 in 5 senior citizens employed , according to the @entity48 of @entity2 , the country has the highest proportion of working seniors in the developed world			1
financial necessities and boredom are among the most commonly cited reasons			0
but even if they do n't have to work for a living , many elderly @entity2 do n't want to live in isolation			1
though not all can replicate the active achievements of @entity7 , many senior citizens still have enough energy to spare or keep an active social life			1
take for example , the @entity62 , a cheerleading squad with an average age of 67			2
the routines are not just a physical exercise , according to the 81 - year - old founder @entity67 , but help keep one 's mind sharp as well			0
in an attempt to deal with swelling pension costs , @entity2 is gradually raising the retirement age to 65 , from 60 last year			1
see also : mapping @entity73 with @entity74 but , active seniors say the public is so used with the stereotype image of the elderly who are frail or walking with a cane that many @entity2 have difficulties with the idea of seeing the elderly stay active , let alone shouting and prancing with a pom - pom			1
" some people deny , can not accept us			0
why ? " says @entity67			0
" @entity2 senior ladies are supposed to be decent and , you know ... not this			1
" many of the women shared their bewilderment at the younger generation			0
" they just play on this , er , what do you call it ? @entity97 ? they do n't talk much			0
they just exchange on this @entity97			0
that 's not good thing , " says @entity67			0
that is surely one lesson these active seniors can teach the younger generation			2
