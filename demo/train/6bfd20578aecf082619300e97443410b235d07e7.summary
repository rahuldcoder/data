@entity0 -- the @entity3 's controversial intelligence - gathering programs have prevented 54 terrorist attacks around the world , including 13 in the @entity6 , according to gen. @entity7 , @entity3 director			1
speaking before a capacity crowd of hackers and security experts wednesday at the @entity12 computer - security conference , @entity7 defended the @entity3 's embattled programs , which collect phone metadata and online communications in an effort to root out potential terrorists			1
the secret programs have come under fire since their existence was revealed in june by former @entity23 contractor @entity21 , who leaked details about them to several newspapers			0
" i promise you the truth -- what we know , what we 're doing , and what i can not tell you because we do n't want to jeopardize our future defense , " @entity7 told the audience , which included a few hecklers who shouted profanities and accused him of lying			1
he then gave a partial recap , using powerpoint slides , of how the two intelligence programs work			0
@entity7 said the @entity3 can collect metadata on phone calls in the @entity6 , including the date and time of the call , the numbers involved and the length of the conversations			1
he made a special point of saying the @entity3 does not have access to the content of citizens ' calls or text messages			2
top senator questions need to collect phone records @entity7 said the @entity3 's prism surveillance program , which probes digital activity such as e-mail , instant messaging and web searches , focuses on foreign actors and does not apply to people in the @entity6			1
he said the phone and @entity67 data is necessary to " connect the dots " and identify potential terrorists before they act			0
@entity7 attempted to reassure the audience that @entity3 officials are not abusing access to the databases to intrude on @entity6 ' privacy			1
" the assumption is that people are out there just wheeling and dealing ( users ' information ) , and nothing could be further from the truth , " he said			0
" we have tremendous oversight and compliance in these programs			0
" @entity85 and courts make sure the programs operate within the bounds of the @entity89 , and internal auditing systems are in place to prevent any abuse by employees , @entity7 said			2
he added that only 35 analysts are authorized to run queries on the phone metadata			0
@entity7 made no mention of a report in wednesday 's @entity100 newspaper about the existence of another secret @entity3 program , called @entity103			1
according to documents provided to the @entity100 by @entity21 , @entity103 allows analysts to search with no prior authorization through vast databases containing e-mails , online chats and the browsing histories of millions of people			0
@entity112 : @entity3 chief to hackers : if you do n't like what we do , change it @entity7 denied accusations that the @entity3 programs allow the government to collect all online data on everyone			1
" we ca n't afford to and do n't want to collect everything , " he said			0
" i have four daughters			0
can i go and intercept their e-mails ? the answer is no , " said the security chief before looking out at the auditorium thick with hackers and joking , " you may be able to			0
" aside from a couple jokes , @entity7 's words were serious and measured , and he seemed unfazed by a smattering of heckling from the audience during his hourlong talk			1
@entity139 chief : safeguards exist to protect @entity6 ' privacy " you lied to @entity85			2
why would we believe you 're not lying to us right now ? " yelled one person			0
@entity7 replied that people were basing opinions on what was " written in the press " without looking at facts and urged the heckler read his congressional testimony			2
during a q&a session consisting of prescreened questions , @entity7 said that one reason terrorists target the @entity6 is a desire by people in the @entity157 to run governments under @entity160 law			1
but another attendee disagreed , shouting , " they want to attack us because we 're bombing them			0
" another yell of " bulls --- ! " inspired the general to cap his explanation of the programs by saying " and that 's no bulls --- , those are facts			0
" overall , the reception to @entity7 's talk seemed mostly positive			2
@entity12 attendees are primarily corporate - security types , interested in protecting their networks and warding off cyber attacks			1
the looser , hacker - centric @entity180 conference , which starts here thursday , could likely give him a more hostile reception			2
@entity7 solicited advice on how to better balance security with civil liberties and put up an e-mail address so the room of tech experts could share their ideas with the @entity3			1
he also hinted at possible damage resulting from the @entity21 leaks , and wondered aloud whether the government will have the same success preventing terrorist attacks in the next 10 years as it has in the past decade			1
" if we tell everyone exactly what we 're doing , then the adversaries will know exactly how to get through our defenses , " he said			0
opinion : @entity3 secrets kill our trust			2
