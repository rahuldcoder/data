a short time earlier , @entity1 police chief @entity23 told reporters about the efforts to find others who were in the five - story building			1
" the rescuers were still searching for bodies in the debris , " @entity23 said			1
such factories -- making products for a number of @entity35 retailers -- play a big part in @entity2 's economy , with ready - made garments alone making up 80 % of the country 's $ 24 billion in annual exports			1
the factory that burned saturday was used to make plastic goods			2
these buildings have n't always proven to be the safest places to work			0
there are many examples in recent years of fatal factory fires in @entity2 , the most glaring being the spring 2013 collapse of a nine - story building that housed five garment factories			1
more than 1,100 people died in that blaze			0
saturday 's fire started on the plastic factor 's ground floor and immediately and quickly spread , fueled by flammable chemicals in the building , firefighters said			2
authorities did n't say how many people were in the building when this happened , and thus how many remained unaccounted for			0

the building collapse months later in @entity1 was even more appalling and exponentially more deadly			0
that blaze spurred widespread criticism about the state of workers rights in @entity2			2
the government responded by revampling laws so that workers no longer need approval from employers to form trade unions , and every factory that sells within the country also has to pledge 5 % of their profits toward a workers ' welfare fund			0
the government also boosted minimum wages from $ 38 to around $ 68 per month			0
