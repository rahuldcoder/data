for anyone holding out hope of @entity3 being reinstated as a major planet , you should probably do as they say in the movie " @entity7 " and " let it go			0
" but here 's a new exciting find from the far reaches of our solar system : astronomers have discovered a dwarf planet that 's even farther away than @entity3 -- so far , in fact , that its orbit reaches into a new edge of the solar system			1
the dwarf planet 's current name is 2012 @entity22 , and it is located in a " wasteland or badland of the solar system , " said astronomer @entity26 , head of adaptive optics at @entity28 in @entity29 and co-discoverer of this object			1
his study was published wednesday in the journal @entity34			0
" the big question is , how is this formed ? how can you get an object out there ? " he said			0
" we really do n't know an answer to that yet			0
" this dwarf planet is unusual because of its orbit , @entity26 said			1
on its elliptical path , the closest it ever comes to the sun is still very far away from the rest of the solar system			1
its full orbit is farther than the orbit of any other object we know of in the solar system			1
" nothing that we currently know in the solar system can make objects that are so distant all the time , that never come close to any of the planets , " @entity26 said			1
the most distant major planet from the sun is @entity64 , orbiting our star at a distance of 30 astronomical units			2
one astronomical unit is the average distance between the @entity70 and the sun -- about 150 million kilometers , or 93 million miles			2
beyond @entity64 is the @entity72 , a doughnut - shaped ring of small objects , which extends from about 30 to 55 @entity75 , according to @entity76			0
this belt may contain hundreds of thousands of large icy objects and trillions of comets , if not more			0
@entity3 is considered a dwarf planet in the @entity72			2
the awkwardly - named 2012 @entity22 is much farther from the sun , currently at 83 astronomical units			1
that puts it at 83 times the distance between our own planet and the sun ( the closest point of its orbit is 80 astronomical units )			1
but in terms of average distance from the sun , there is a dwarf planet even farther out : @entity98 , which @entity26 helped discover			1
@entity98 is bigger than @entity3 , and has a satellite called @entity101			0
the presence of @entity98 helped scientists determine that @entity3 should not be counted among the major planets			0
@entity105 , a dwarf planet that @entity26 co-discovered as well in 2004 , is located in the same distant area , and takes about 10,500 years to orbit the sun. " finding @entity105 so far away seemed odd and potentially a fluke , " said @entity110 , professor of astronomy at @entity112 , in an e-mail			1
" but this one is beginning to make it look like that might be a typical place for objects to be			0
not at all what i would have guessed			0
" this home of @entity105 and 2012 @entity22 is called the " inner @entity123			1
" it may be where some comets come from , @entity26 said			0
@entity26 's study also suggests that there could be a large planet that no one has seen , way out at 250 astronomical units , affecting the orbits of @entity105 and the new dwarf planet			2
but this is only a theory ; the planet has not been detected			0
@entity110 , who was not involved in this study , also co-discovered @entity105			0
" these unusual objects -- @entity105 and this new one -- can tell us about very early in the solar system , when the sun and planets were just forming , " @entity110 said			1
scientists have not been able to discern what 2012 @entity22 's composition is , but most would suspect it is icy because of its distance from the sun , @entity26 said			1
its color is slightly reddish , and " not especially unusual compared to @entity72 objects , " @entity26 said			0
@entity152 and colleagues estimate that the new dwarf planet is relatively small -- about 450 kilometers ( 280 miles ) in diameter , which less than the driving distance from @entity158 to @entity159			1
it 's probably ball - shaped , he said			0
so why is this not a major planet such as @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity70 and @entity165 ? @entity26 explains that a bona fide planet is big enough that other objects in its orbit will be sucked into it gravitationally			2
a dwarf planet is not big enough to become gravitationally dominant ; it 's too small to pull in objects in the area of its path			2
it 's possible that this dwarf planet formed very early in our solar system 's history , in the region between @entity183 and @entity184 , and then got thrown out beyond @entity3			1
one theory is that , billions of years ago , another star passed by our sun and took material with it out to a distant orbit			0
as far as we know , it 's too cold out where the dwarf planet is to have liquid water , @entity26 said			2
" to me , what this discovery really shows is that we are on verge of finally being able to read the story that @entity105 is trying to tell us , and that the next few years should bring a flood of new discoveries in this new region of the outer solar system , " @entity110 said			2
2012 @entity22 will be eventually renamed , but @entity26 's website says it 's informally called " @entity207 " because of the " vp " designation			1
follow @entity210 on @entity211 at @ lizlandau			0

2012 @entity22 is a newly discovered dwarf planet
its full orbit is farther than the orbit of any other solar system object
it is located 83 times the distance between @entity70 and the sun
