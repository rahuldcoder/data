@entity0 -- @entity2 is no ordinary advocate for women 's rights in @entity4			1
he is a rapist who sought out his victim two decades after his brutal act to ask for forgiveness			1
he is all this in a nation where sexual assault has become so common that a woman in @entity4 is more likely to be raped than learn to read			1
sexual assaults rarely shock anyone anymore , though a video of a brutal gang rape of a mentally disabled teenager went viral on the @entity16 last month			1
as the young suspects face their day in court , @entity2 spoke with @entity1 to tell his own story -- an extraordinary tale of violence , redemption and determination to change things in his homeland			1
@entity2 was 15 when he raped			1
the boys in his village of @entity30 taunted him because he did n't herd cattle and instead went home to help his sisters			2

" @entity37 , " the village boys jeered , and challenged him to prove his manhood			2
the way to do that was by having sex			2

" i was afraid because i 'd never had sex before , " @entity2 says			1
at 5 o'clock in the evening , he met his friends , drank beer , smoked marijuana			2
the first boy raped her ; then the second			1
it was @entity2 's turn			1
after it was over , he felt terrible , wracked with guilt and scared that his parents would find out			2
he says he never gave a thought about how the victim was feeling			2
" it 's because when the environment accepts that behavior as a norm , you do n't pay to much attention to it , " he says			2
the @entity4 police say there were 66,196 cases of rape in 2010 - 2011			1
but many believe that number is much higher because many rapes go unreported			2
the girl @entity2 raped never reported what happened and @entity2 was never charged			1
she never even spoke about it with anyone			0
she was too scared of the consequences , @entity2 says			1
a @entity86 study found that 28 percent of men in @entity4 reported having perpetrated rape ; three - quarters of first - time rapists are like @entity2 -- under the age of 20			1
" this violence , there is violence elsewhere in the world , but you do n't see the staggering numbers of rapes that are seen here in @entity4 , " @entity2 says			1

@entity2 did not know what to do			1
he simply stood before her			0

sometimes , she said , when her husband touches her , she cringes , even though she is happy with him			0

" there 's a long history of violence , " women 's rights activist @entity169 tells @entity1			1
" there 's a long history of responding to conflict in a violent manner , of trying to solve problems through using violence			2
" we also have , i think , a long history of patriarchy , of not recognizing women 's rights fully , of not recognizing them necessarily as being full human beings in full -- and having all the rights of men necessarily do , " @entity169 says			0
some activists say apartheid is just a convenient excuse			0
@entity190 , a rape victim turned activist , asks how anyone can blame history for the acts of the seven youths suspected in the videotaped gang rape			2
" you ca n't blame apartheid here , " she says on @entity1			0
" you ca n't even blame the government			0
you ca n't blame anybody but our society for this type of violence			2
" it 's just that they are doing it because they can , " she says , blaming what she called inefficient , understaffed and under - resourced police departments , courts and hospitals			0
