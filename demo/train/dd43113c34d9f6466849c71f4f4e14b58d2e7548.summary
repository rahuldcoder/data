an international war of words has broken out over a @entity6 pop star 's chart - topping single , after an @entity3 blogger labeled the track racist			1
" @entity17 , " the debut single by @entity8 , the stage name of @entity8 , currently sits above hits from @entity10 and @entity11 at no. 1 on the @entity13 chart , making the 16 - year - old the youngest artist to top the @entity3 chart in 26 years			1
the singer -- who sings about rejecting the trappings of consumerism in " @entity17 " and has admonished fellow pop star @entity21 for being insufficiently feminist -- has won plaudits from critics as a refreshing presence in the charts			1
but not everyone is a fan			0
in a post on the prominent feminist blog @entity30 , writer @entity27 took issue with the song 's lyrics , in which @entity8 sings that " every song " is about gold teeth and @entity36 luxury cars -- both fixtures of hip - hop music videos -- before concluding " we do n't care , we 're driving cadillacs in our dreams			1
" " while i love a good critique of wealth accumulation and inequity , this song is not one ; in fact , it is deeply racist , " wrote @entity27			2
" because we all know who she 's thinking when we 're talking gold teeth , @entity50 ( champagne ) and @entity36			0
so why s --- on black folks ? why s --- on rappers ? " the writer attacked critics who " have been so captivated by ' @entity17 ' call - out of consumption that they did n't bother to take the time to think critically about the racial implications of the lyrics			1
" she concluded her post with the observation that the singer " apparently calls herself a feminist			2
" " let 's just hope her feminism gets a lot less racist as she develops as an artist , " she wrote			0
the post attracted a massive online backlash from @entity8 's fans and compatriots as well as other writers , with many claiming that @entity27 , by interpreting the song through the prism of @entity3 race relations , was guilty of the kind of cultural arrogance she was attributing to the singer			1
" i realize not everything in this world is an instrument of oppression , " wrote @entity6 journalist @entity81			2
" and not everything in this world should be viewed through the lens of @entity3 , particularly when it comes to race and cultures of other countries			2
to insist otherwise is ignorant at best and imperialistic at worst			0
" the track was the songwriter 's response to the images of unattainable luxury often conveyed through a @entity3 - dominated pop culture , @entity81 wrote			1
" the theme of the song is the dissonance between that life ... and the one she lives in @entity6 , but it is not at all about race			1
" while a few of the trappings of conspicuous consumption cited in the song were associated with rappers , it also name - checked others associated with other wealthy , high - living stereotypes			2
" @entity112 planes , islands , tigers on a gold leash ? i 'm thinking @entity117 and maybe @entity119 oligarchs there , " wrote @entity81			0
" blood stains and ball gowns ? celeb socialites ... @entity123 ' the hotel room ? rock stars			0
" @entity127 writer @entity126 said @entity27 ' reading of the song " could n't be more simplistic " and asked : " why should anyone be surprised that the proliferation of pop songs about conspicuous consumption would get tiresome eventually ? " a commenter on feministing.com , @entity136 , called the post " a dreadfully done piece of deconstruction			1
" " i hope you have a better understanding of your own bias and lack of understanding of the world beyond your own , and an interest in the impact of imported @entity3 culture on the rest of the world			2
" others noted with disappointment that a vocal young feminist role model was being attacked on a feminist blog			2
despite the overwhelmingly critical response to her post , @entity27 told @entity158 in an email that she stood by her comments , which had focused " on how the song lands in the context of the @entity3			1
" " clearly it has reached a much wider audience now , " she added			0
she took exception to how the song directs " a critique of excessive consumption to a genre both created and currently dominated by @entity169 , particularly when the vast majority of excess consumption is done by white people - not to mention the fact that black people bear the brunt of the ill effects of wealth inequality , both in this country and globally , " @entity27 said			1
most of her critique is directed at record companies , @entity3 media and " longstanding racist narratives " about consumption , she said			1
while the genre is n't above criticism , hip - hop " must be critiqued in a way that contextualizes it within a larger system of race and power , " she added			0
" to do so without this context reinforces racist narratives which feed into a larger system of racism that consistently dehumanizes people of color , and serve to uphold and excuse much larger oppressive systems			0
" a spokesman for @entity201 , @entity8 's label , said the singer had no comment in response to the criticism			1
in an interview with @entity208 , @entity8 described how the song was inspired by the messages conveyed by the pop music she had grown up with			1
" i was just sort of reeling off some of the things which are commonly mentioned in hip - hop and the @entity214 , " she said			0
" i 've always loved hip - hop , but as a fan of hip - hop , i 've always had to kind of suspend disbelief because , obviously , i do n't have a @entity219			0
there 's a distance between that and the life i have with my friends going to parties and getting public transport and doing the things that every other teenager does			0
" the lyrics in question are : but every song 's like gold teeth , @entity233 , tripping in the bathroom , blood stains , ball gowns , trashing the hotel room , we do n't care , we 're driving cadillacs in our dreams			0
but everybody 's like @entity50 , @entity36 , diamonds on your time piece , @entity112 planes , islands , tigers on a gold leash			0
we do n't care , we are n't caught up in your love affair .			0

@entity252 says song *unfairly* focuses on consumption in genre dominated by @entity3 blacks
" the vast majority of excess consumption is done by white people , " blogger says
" @entity17 , " the debut song by @entity6 singer @entity8 , is @entity264 on the @entity13
the blog has drawn an angry response , *accusing* the writer of *misinterpreting* the song
