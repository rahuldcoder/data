the @entity0 will begin testing an experimental @entity2 vaccine in people as early as september , the @entity0 announced thursday			1
the federal agency has been working on the @entity2 vaccine over the last few years and says it has seen positive results when testing it on primates			1
dr. @entity9 , director of the @entity10 , said @entity0 has been working with the @entity11 to get the vaccine into early trials as soon as possible			1
according to @entity10 , the results of the trial could come early next year			0
the announcement comes the same day the @entity17 raised its travel alert for @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 from level two to level three , warning against any nonessential travel to the region due to the @entity2 epidemic			1
since 2003 , the agency has only issued level 3 alerts on two occasions : during the outbreak of @entity30 , severe acute respiratory syndrome , in 2003 , and in the aftermath of the 2010 @entity34 earthquake			1
the @entity17 is sending 50 additional personnel to the three countries , @entity17 director @entity35 said			1
they will be working to speed up laboratory testing , trace potentially infected people and strengthen the local health care systems			1
experts : the @entity43 is ready for @entity2 @entity2 is believed to have killed 729 people in @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity45 between march 1 and july 27 , according to the @entity46			1
stopping this particular epidemic could take months			0
" it 's like fighting a forest fire , " @entity35 said			0
if you leave even one burning ember , the epidemic can start again			0
this is not the first @entity2 vaccine to be tested on humans and not the only treatment in the works			1
in march , a group at the @entity59 in @entity60 , led by @entity61 , a professor of microbiology and immunology , was awarded a five year , $ 26 million grant to work with three promising @entity2 therapies			1
@entity61 is best known as the man who discovered an airborne strain of @entity2 that infects only monkeys			1
the grant covers three treatments that are thought to be the most promising - i.e. they have shown substantial ability to protect animals against @entity2 in a laboratory setting , @entity61 said			1
" so these treatments , one of these is actually a vaccine that works as a post-exposure treatment , much like the rabies vaccine when used here in the @entity43			2
another is a small molecule inhibitor called a @entity83			0
and the third is just conventional monoclonal antibodies			0
all of these have been able to protect nonhuman primates against @entity2 when given after exposure			1
" the experimental vaccine @entity61 is working with has been nearly 100 % effective in preventing infection in macaque monkeys , and also shows some effectiveness as a treatment when given soon after an exposure			2
in 2009 , it was given to a lab worker in @entity97 after the worker reported being accidentally pricked with a needle			0
the worker did not develop @entity2 , although it 's not clear whether that 's because of the vaccine			1
because of its strict rules and standards , the @entity11 can take years to get a vaccine to market			2
but it does makes exceptions to fast - track drug development , especially when it comes to deadly diseases like @entity2			2
@entity61 said that 's important , because unlike outbreaks of @entity2 in the past , this epidemic is harder to manage " i think it 's very different , i mean historically outbreaks have occurred in @entity116 and they have been relatively easy to contain , " @entity61 said			2
" usually , the outbreaks tend to occur in small villages , but it 's controlled and kind of burns out			0
what we are seeing in @entity121 here is completely different			0
" they are having the virus occur simultaneously across a very large geographic area in different locations all at the same time			0
and that 's very difficult to contain because again the organizations with the expertise in controlling these outbreaks , their resources are really spread thin			0
" the @entity2 infection often is fatal			2
at this point , there are no vaccines that protect humans from the deadly virus			0
according to the @entity46 , more than 1,300 people have been infected in @entity121 in this recent epidemic			0
public health officials have called this the worst @entity2 outbreak in history			2
ebola outbreak : is it time to test experimental vaccines ?			0

ebola vaccine could be tested on people as soon as september , @entity0 says
@entity152 has been working on the @entity2 vaccine over the last few years
@entity17 raises travel alert for @entity19 , @entity20 , and @entity21 from level 2 to level 3
