a video from 2011 has resurfaced showing @entity3 - born @entity2 spokesman @entity1 discussing how easy it is to buy guns in the @entity3 and urging fellow radicals to do so			1
in the video , the @entity7 - raised @entity1 said militants should arm themselves for attacks on @entity12 governments			0
" @entity3 is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms , " said @entity1 , " you can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle , without a background check , and most likely without having to show an identification card			1
so what are you waiting for ? " @entity2 supports lone wolf terrorists abroad and has emphasized shootings , which require less specialized training than bombings or other attacks and may have a better chance of succeeding			1
the @entity29 psychiatrist accused in the @entity30 in november 2009 and the suspect in the shooting of two @entity3 servicemen at @entity34 in early 2011 allegedly were inspired by @entity2			1
@entity1 is n't new to sharing his thoughts through video			2
in 2006 , he praised those who took part in the 9/11 attacks and called president @entity40 a " devious , evasive and serpentine @entity3 president with a @entity43 name			0
" however , the video released in june 2011 has found new life on buzzfeed.com amid the drive for new gun control laws in the @entity3 following last december 's school massacre in @entity49			1
federal law requires background checks on gun sales from licensed dealers and proposed legislation in the @entity55 would expand the mandate to gun shows and internet transactions			0
still , @entity1 was wrong about the ease of buying a fully automatic weapon			2
it is illegal under federal law to do so from anyone but a specially - licensed dealer , and additional permission is required as is a background check			0
are they legal ? yes			0
are they as easily obtainable as @entity1 suggests ? no.			0
