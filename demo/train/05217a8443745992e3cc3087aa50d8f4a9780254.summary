i met an entrepreneur recently who was comparing doing business in @entity4 's two biggest countries			1
" when i 'm in @entity5 , " he said , " i spend the first 40 minutes of any meeting exchanging niceties			1
in the last five minutes , we get to business			2
" what about @entity11 ? " we do business for 40 minutes			1
right at the end , we chit - chat for five			0
" it 's only an anecdote , but the results seem to bear it out			2
@entity11 gets things done ; @entity5 invents ways not to			1
@entity11 dazzles the world by hosting an impeccable @entity19 ; @entity5 struggles to complete basic infrastructure for the @entity21			1
perhaps that 's why it 's fascinating to watch the rise of @entity5 's @entity25 , the man many believe will be @entity5 's next prime minister			1
@entity25 's sales pitch is simple : he gets things done			2
for @entity5 , it 's a seductive notion : can @entity5 be like @entity11 ? there is no doubt that @entity5 has room to improve			1
consider productivity : @entity5 's ranks 60th in the world on the @entity37 's ranking of countries by competitiveness ( @entity11 is 29th )			1
or consider ease of doing business : the @entity42 ranks @entity5 134th in the world			1
if you want to start a business , the @entity42 says @entity5 ranks 179th in the world -- in other words , go ahead and explore opportunities in 178 other countries before you settle on @entity5			1
it 's as good as putting a " closed " sign on the shop door			0
for businesses in @entity5 and beyond , @entity25 represents an end to red tape			1
@entity5 's financial markets are salivating at the prospect of his leadership -- stocks are up 20 % since his candidacy was announced last september			1
if you speak to voters in his home state of @entity65 -- which has flourished with @entity11 levels of growth under his leadership in the last decade -- @entity25 represents the joys of getting rich			1
sounds familiar ? that 's because it evokes @entity72 , the @entity11 premier who kick - started national reforms and an unprecedented period of growth			1
it 's not just @entity72			0
@entity25 has been compared to a number of world leaders			0
some say he would be like @entity80 , @entity81 's visionary leader			0
( note that implicit in these comparisons is the understanding that @entity25 could tend toward being authoritarian )			0
others say the best person to compare @entity25 to is @entity87 president @entity86 -- because both were outsiders resented by traditional elites			0
still others insist the best analogy is former @entity93 pm @entity92 , because of their shared appetite for privatization and small government			0
@entity25 could be any -- or none -- of those leaders			0
the truth is we just do n't know ; we do n't have enough information about his track record , and how it could translate across @entity5			1
but the larger point is that this is not just about @entity25 , it 's about @entity5			1
the @entity105 's @entity104 rightly points out that even the most reform - minded prime minister would face many hurdles			0
among them , @entity104 cites a @entity110 study of 50 of the central government 's stalled investment projects : 40 of them fell through because of state , and not central , red tape			0
constitutionally , there 's little a prime minister can do about that , no matter how reform - minded			0
let me use another anecdote to explain the task ahead for the world 's biggest democracy			0
@entity5 are infamous for being unpunctual			2
so , one wonders , is that genetic ? are @entity5 inherently prone to being late to meetings ? the answer is no. take an @entity5 who is unpunctual , and place him in @entity128 -- he 'll likely be on time for every meeting he schedules			2
similarly , a @entity128 would likely become unpunctual in @entity133			0
the reason is that punctuality is based on economic incentive -- if everyone is always on time , then it makes sense to make an effort to be on time			0
it follows then , punctuality is based on inertia			0
if everyone 's doing it , it 's in your best interest to follow suit			0
in a free democracy like @entity5 , progress is based on inertia , too			2
everyone needs to push at the same time			0
@entity5 can dream to have cities like @entity81 , @entity156 or @entity157			2
but to do so they will need more than just one reform - minded leader			0
they will need change from the bottom up			2
for better or worse , such is the nature of @entity5 's secular , constitutional democracy			1
@entity5 can certainly learn from @entity11			1
but to do that , it does n't have to become @entity11			2
in the next few weeks and months , that is the issue @entity5 will be debating .			2

@entity168 : @entity5 's business *culture* could profit from being more like @entity11 's
he says many in @entity5 hope *winner* of the *election* will introduce more *efficiency*
while new leadership can focus on economy , it 's not so easy to *reshape* a nation , he says
@entity168 : for real change , the impetus has to come up from the bottom up
