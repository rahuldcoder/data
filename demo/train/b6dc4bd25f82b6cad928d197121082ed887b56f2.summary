-- through @entity3 propaganda and a vibrant social media presence , @entity1 is actively encouraging young @entity5 to join its cause to take up arms in @entity8 and @entity9			1
some @entity5 have joined the militant group , according to officials			2
intelligence officials fear the number will grow higher since @entity1 has been successful with recruitment in some @entity16 countries			2
@entity5 need to wake up to the frightening reality of this threat taking root in our communities			1
while president @entity26 searches for a strategy to confront @entity1 in @entity8 and @entity9 , federal , state and local governmental organizations ( including law enforcement agencies ) and communities are already working together to confront the problem with this group now calling itself the @entity30			1
the situation of young people acquiring radicalized beliefs without yet committing crimes is worrisome			1
the question is : how do we prevent violent ideologies from taking hold of people in the first place , and how to intervene and dissuade them from crossing the line towards actual violence ? @entity45 teen pleads guilty in plan to join @entity1 the term used to describe this effort is " countering violent extremism , " or @entity50			1
similar to community - oriented policing methods , @entity50 focuses on engagement and partnership with communities			2
@entity50 stems from the @entity56 's national security strategy and has the active support of multiple federal agencies , but it is highly dependent on cities , counties and states to devise solutions			0
consider what is happening in @entity64			0
in 2008 , the @entity65 established a @entity66 of its counter-terrorism and @entity68			0
its mission is " to improve the quality of life and public safety within diverse communities by building mutual partnerships and trust through coordination and collaboration of all department entities , government stakeholders , public / private / faith - based organizations , nongovernmental organizations with local communities			1
" for example , the @entity65 began holding a quarterly @entity84			2
each forum is held in a mosque and hosts about two dozen representatives from @entity84 organizations throughout the greater @entity64 area where they join for dialogues			1
police officers and @entity84 - @entity5 community advocates in @entity64 believe that the program has been successful			1
they report that the @entity65 has been able to engage multiple , key organizations and leaders in the communities and to form partnerships that build trust , challenge misinformation , educate people , promote transparency , defuse conflicts , open communication channels and solve daily problems			1
community advocates said they are being regarded as part of the solution , not part of the problem			0
deputy chief @entity109 , the commanding officer of the counter-terrorism and @entity68 , stipulates that law enforcement - community partnerships are essential to the objective of " making the environment hostile to violent extremism			0
" one of the department 's key partners is the @entity116 ( @entity116 ) , whose director , @entity117 , believes that law enforcement and community leaders must play distinct roles in the collaborative fight against violent extremism			0
he sees prevention as primarily the responsibility of communities , and many community members readily agree			0
@entity116 is rolling out " @entity127 , " an innovative community - led @entity50 initiative in mosques across the @entity5			2
@entity127 aims to increase @entity84 - @entity5 communities ' resilience against violent extremism through community - led prevention and intervention activities			1
@entity127 works in part through getting families and communities to talk together about difficult topics			0
it tells parents about the threats of recruitment and radicalization to violence			0
according to its facilitator 's guide , " we 're not sharing this story to scare you ; only to highlight the serious need for communities to build healthy and safe spaces			0
" the initiative teaches helpful strategies to increase parental involvement and supportive adult mentorship for youth			0
another key component of @entity127 is helping communities form " crisis inquiry teams " that can identify individuals believed to be at risk of engaging in violent beliefs and help them turn away from that path			1
communities learn that if those efforts fail , and the risk of violent behavior becomes real , then they are obligated to notify law enforcement			0
across the @entity5 , new strategies are being developed			2
in @entity170 , @entity171 , the effort is not being led by the police but rather through a public - private partnership involving the faith - based community and law enforcement			0
in @entity178 , @entity177 , initiatives aim to promote public safety without singling out terrorism or any one ethnic community			1
what most efforts have in common is establishing innovative public - private partnerships that increase mutual trust , build capacities , strengthen resilience and then develop and evaluate community - delivered prevention and intervention activities			0
opinion : when @entity5 leave for jihad most communities do n't have such experiences , so there is a need for expanding training and technical assistance that draws on community policing practices and on the lessons learned from implementing programs such as @entity127			1
with the growing threat of recruitment to @entity1 , the @entity5 government needs to build on the successes in these and other cities , as well learn from the successes of countries such as @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211			1
we have to figure out how to increase knowledge of @entity50 strategies ; how to accelerate implementation efforts throughout the @entity5 ; and how to measure the relative effectiveness of different @entity50 initiatives .			2

@entity1 is encouraging @entity5 to join its cause to take up arms in @entity8 and @entity9
@entity222 : we must find ways to prevent this threat from taking root in our communities
he says the key is to stop young people from acquiring radicalized beliefs
@entity222 : communities in the @entity5 are partnering with @entity84 groups to promote public safety
