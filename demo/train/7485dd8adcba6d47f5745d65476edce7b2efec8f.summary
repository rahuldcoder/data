-- contradicting claims by a coroner and her family , a new report by @entity3 authorities concludes 16 - year - old @entity7 was already dead when two fire trucks ran over her on the @entity11 airport 's tarmac			1
the official accident investigation prepared by @entity13 and city fire department officials -- submitted earlier this month but not revealed publicly until wednesday , states that " ample evidence refutes " the contention that @entity7 was killed by the vehicles			1
at least three firefighters determined that the @entity20 teenager -- who , it was determined , was n't wearing a seatbelt when she was ejected from @entity23 as it crashed july 6 -- was dead before she was struck , the report found			1
" as trained mass casualty responders , the firefighters moved onto other immediate tasks " after quickly determining @entity7 had died , the report said			1
" tragically and regretfully , two ... vehicles later rolled over the deceased during active firefighting operations			0
" one person who does n't buy this argument is @entity36 coroner @entity35 , who performed the autopsy on @entity7 's body			1
he determined she died of blunt trauma injuries			2
@entity42 victims sue @entity43 @entity35 said he was giving " an unbiased review " and " does n't have a dog in this , " but said of the investigation 's finding : " it is not factually accurate			2
" the coroner added : " ( her injuries were ) consistent with being run over by a motor vehicle and there is overwhelming physical and scientific evidence to support she was run over			0
" @entity57 is n't alone			0
earlier this month , a lawyer for @entity7 's family said video shows several firefighters saw her lying on the tarmac , but none " did the basic step of checking if she was alive			1
" " it 's unthinkable , " the attorney , @entity66 , told @entity0 's " @entity68 360			0
" " it 's unimaginable , because the first thing -- the first priority of the firefighters or any rescue personnel -- is saving lives , and the first step in triage is to take the pulse , check the respiration			0
" the 16 - year - old was on her way to an @entity84 summer camp from her home in @entity20 when the crash happened			0
she and the two other victims -- one of whom died six days later -- were sitting in the back of the plane when they were ejected as the @entity43 crashed			1
the investigation determined that one first responder first thought @entity7 was a doll after noticing her in front of the plane 's left wing amid a debris cloud			2
several firefighters determined " very early in the response " that she was dead but did not move her body , in part so they could devote their time to helping others and also so as not to move it before other officials could inspect it , the report said			1
they were all part of an intense , sizable firefighting and rescue effort			0
most of the more than 300 people on board began leaving the plane on their own accord within 90 seconds of impact , though five people -- including the three who died -- were ejected and five others were taken off by firefighters			2
all the while , crews were battling flames inside and outside the aircraft			0
" unique among recent airplane accidents in the @entity84 , the incident resulted in more than 300 persons receiving triage in the midst of heavy rescue and firefighting activity with the potential for an imminent explosion			0
" the new report lamented the lack of a firm protocol for first responders on what they should do when there 's a fatality at the same time as an active firefighting operation involving fast - moving crews , but did not say firefighters erred or caused @entity7 's death			1
@entity36 district attorney @entity148 announced last october that a firefighter who accidentally ran over her body would not face charges			0
the @entity3 investigation report appears unlikely to please those who believe the @entity20 teen was alive until vehicles hit her			2
talking about the dispute over how @entity7 died , @entity35 -- the @entity36 coroner -- said , " it 's unfortunate that it 's come to this			1
" firefighters saw injured girl before she was run over			0

@entity7 , 16 , was one of three killed when @entity23 crashed
a new official report says she was ejected and was n't wearing a seatbelt
report : at least three firefighters determined she was dead but did n't move her
coroner says this finding is *wrong* and she died after being struck by vehicles
