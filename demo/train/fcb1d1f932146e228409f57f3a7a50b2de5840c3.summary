@entity0 -- it 's shaping up to be a good year for the @entity3 and they have n't even kicked off the regular season yet			1
sixth - seeded wide receiver @entity6 came out of nowhere to beat top - seeded @entity8 quarterback @entity7 in the fan vote for who would grace the cover of @entity13 ' " @entity12 ' 1			1
" on top of that , former @entity3 running back @entity14 , who appeared with coach @entity15 on the front of @entity17 , is on the cover of @entity13 " @entity21 " this year , behind fellow @entity24 winner @entity23 iii. @entity6 appeared in a live one - hour @entity26 " @entity31 " tv show in the streets of @entity28 , while fans voted online to make the final push			1
his first duty as cover athlete was to shoot the cover , which was done on location in the @entity36 right after the live broadcast in front of hundreds of @entity40 fans ( many of whom were in town for the @entity44 )			0
being a cover model is n't all that 's going @entity6 's way this year			1
the @entity3 signed the wide receiver to an eight - year , $ 132 million extension just before he was awarded the @entity15 cover			1
@entity6 has also been helping @entity15 experience record sales since the game launched on august 28 on @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			1
the game sold nearly 1 million copies in its first 24 hours and sales are up 7 % over last year 's game , which featured @entity61 on the cover			1
with the @entity64 version of " @entity65 " coming this fall , @entity6 took some time to talk about his own gaming background off the gridiron			1
@entity1 : what games did you play growing up ? @entity6 : growing up i was a big fan of the @entity71 and those games , but i always played @entity15			1
i 've always been a @entity15 fan , and an @entity74 fan , period			0
@entity1 : what was the first @entity15 game that you recall playing ? @entity6 : the first one i recall playing			1
i ca n't even recall that			0
i do n't even know who was on the cover , and this was back in early 2000s			1
@entity1 : what are your thoughts on how far the game itself has evolved over the years since you started playing ? @entity6 : it 's pretty cool			1
back in the day , @entity74 used to pick , but to know that 20 million fans vote and that they voted for me , it 's an honor			2
@entity1 : what 's your favorite @entity15 video game memory ? @entity6 : my favorite @entity15 memory would probably be taking another kick - off return to house , because i 've only done that one time in the game			1
it 's very hard to do			0
that 's the @entity15 with @entity104 and @entity105 on the cover in 2010			2
@entity1 : as a player , how realistic is the game now compared to playing out there on the field ? @entity6 : it 's pretty crazy what they 're doing with the game nowadays			1
i heard that they now have the ability for you to traject where the ball is going to go as a quarterback , so you could put it in more specific places for your receiver to catch it and lead the receiver			0
it 's pretty crazy how it 's evolving			0
@entity1 : do you have more control with the receiver , too , in getting the ball ? @entity6 : it 's crazy			1
i heard they 've got hundreds of new animations for the receivers as well			0
it 's definitely turned into a passing league , and it 's turned into a passing video game			0
@entity1 : how popular is @entity15 among some of the @entity40 players on your team ? do you guys compete against each other and go online ? @entity6 : i play			2
we play online , but definitely during camp time			0
guys , when we 're at camp , they have a suite at the hotel for us if we want to get in there and play , or we play it in our own facility			0
@entity1 : what kind of impact do you think that being on the cover of the game will be for your player rating ? @entity6 : i actually just got off the phone with somebody , and they were saying that my rating should definitely be a 99 , especially since i 'm on the cover			1
@entity1 : where do you put this as far as accomplishments in the @entity40 , being on the cover of @entity15 ? @entity6 : when i was a kid looking up to all the greats that were on the covers coming up , and then to be one of those guys on the cover , it 's surreal			1
knowing that millions of fans took part in the campaign , and to be the one they selected to appear on the cover of the game they play every day is an honor			2
to make it this far , and to beat out guys like @entity7 and @entity188 , a @entity189 - winning quarterback , it 's surreal to say the least			1
much love to all the fans who voted for me			0
@entity1 : when did you realize how big @entity15 has become , evolving from game to pop culture phenomenon ? @entity6 : i saw how big it was yesterday			2
the stage that they set up in @entity199 , and what they 're able to do just because of this game			0
the game , obviously , has this tremendous impact on the @entity15 community			0
i wanted to be in the @entity15 fraternity myself			0
like i said , it 's an honor			2
@entity1 : what are your thoughts on the " @entity211 " that has impacted a lot of previous cover athletes ? @entity6 : yeah , that 's superstition			1
that 's one thing about me ; i 'm definitely not superstitious			2
@entity1 : what kind of technology do you use nowadays ? what kind of gadgets do you use and play with ? @entity6 : i 'm definitely a gadget guy			2
i always have all my @entity224 items , so i can sync it up real fast			0
you 've got the @entity227 and the new xbox			0
i 'll be on @entity229			0
with all the remote controls that control everything in the house , i 'm definitely a gadget guy			0
@entity1 : what games do you play now besides @entity15 ? @entity6 : really just @entity15 , @entity234 , and a little @entity235			2
@entity1 : any online games ? @entity6 : yeah , i do all that online			2
@entity1 : how often do you play video games , and what 's your schedule like during the off - season versus during the season ? @entity6 : during the off - season i have a lot of free time on my hands , whether it be training , spending time with your family , travel , or whatever it may be			1
during the season , it 's pretty tough			0
you do n't really have as much time to play the games , because you 're tired and you 've got to work .			0

@entity6 is the cover model for " @entity65 "
@entity3 receiver upset @entity7 , others to earn the honor
