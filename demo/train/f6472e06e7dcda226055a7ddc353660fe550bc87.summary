-- thursday night 's debate was the @entity3 show			1
and like many shows , the beginning was excellent , the middle was painful to watch , and the finish was what we expected			2
the beginning : i 'm calling it the first 45 minutes			2
the vice president was at his best			1
yes , he had some smiles , but he had those four years ago			2
this time it was more obvious because the camera was always on him , and his teeth seemed so white as to make a dentist blush			2
seriously , put the bleach tray down , @entity3 , or there wo n't be enough left over for washing the dirty clothes			1
however , @entity3 followed those smiles ( and laughs -- which i do n't like and always recommend against ) with indignation about what @entity28 was saying			1
he followed those smiles with arguments that @entity28 was wrong on his facts , wrong on his history and wrong about president @entity33			2
had it not been clear that @entity3 was smiling because he thought @entity28 was saying something ridiculous , it would have bothered me more			1
but for me , the smiles did n't get in the way too much once i put my @entity38 on			0
for the first 45 minutes , @entity3 dominated the discussion			1
the domination began with him telling @entity28 , " with all due respect , that 's a bunch of malarkey			2
" @entity3 never let up			1
he hammered away on the topic of @entity45 , arguing that the @entity46 would n't have been successful at getting support for sanctions from either @entity49 or @entity50			0
opinion : @entity52 , wonky @entity28 foreign policy is @entity3 's wheelhouse			1
so when the topic came to @entity56 and @entity28 continued @entity58 's line that @entity33 does n't consider prime minister @entity60 a close ally , @entity3 had one of his best moments			1
he said " @entity60 " @entity60 has " been my friend 39 years			0
" so he both reminded us of his experience in foreign policy and made clear that he considers @entity60 such a friend that he calls him by his nickname			0
it was an excellent moment for @entity3			1
@entity3 's strength in this debate was his approach to the middle class and senior citizens			1
he never failed to take an opportunity to remind the @entity77 public that @entity58 is " a guy who says 47 % of the @entity77 people are unwilling to take responsibility for their own lives			0
" @entity3 tied @entity58 's " 47 % " comments ( even saying , " if you heard that little soliloquy on 47 % and you think he just made a mistake , then i got a bridge to sell you " ) into his best points of the evening			1
he looked right at the camera and said , " folks , use your common sense			0
who do you trust on this ? " and " folks , follow your instincts " on issues such as @entity98 vouchers and @entity100 privatization			0
at one point he spoke directly to seniors			0
it was a nice touch			0
but then inertia took over			0
i 'll call this the next 30 minutes			0
after running right over @entity28 , with the @entity46 barely making headway for the first 45 minutes , @entity3 lost control of the car			1
the over-steering was perhaps due to excessive coaching after the president 's lackluster debate			1
at any rate , once he had run over @entity28 , it was a quick swerve in the other direction , and then @entity3 thumped the moderator , @entity117 , with interrupting indignation			1
then @entity3 accidentally hit the gas instead of the brake pedal			1
his runaway berating was now headed toward the townsfolk			0
@entity3 kept pointing his finger menacingly			1
at first , only @entity28 was the victim of the loose finger			0
but then @entity3 became trigger - happy with that finger - as - weapon			1
@entity117 could n't duck fast enough and became the next target			0
strafing the audience indiscriminately with his scolding , @entity3 was now pointing and shaking his index finger at anything that moved			1
opinion : partisans are fired up on both sides this was cringe - worthy			0
@entity3 was so wound up that he was like that family member you 're warned about before the big @entity140 get - together			1
" now , do n't get @entity141 riled up , because once he gets going , nobody will enjoy their pumpkin pie			0
he simply did n't know , or did n't have the capability to turn his frustration and emotions off			0
he interrupted , pointed and scolded so often that i think he finished one point with the phrase , " you kids get out of my yard			0
" yet he calmed down and was saved by a personal question about abortion			0
yes , @entity3 's emotions were put back in check by talking about a woman 's right to choose			1
you know it 's a crazy debate when that happens			2
and for the rest of the debate , he was back to regular @entity3			1
he still made emotional appeals , but they were more in check			0
he was very good again for the last 15 minutes			0
by the way , who was that high school debater up on the stage with @entity3 ? @entity28 reminded me of so many debaters i 've seen in the past			2
youthful , with ideas -- but in a critical debate they get lost			2
i 'm not sure @entity28 demonstrated that he 's what we need in these tough times			2
he lacked passion , and he seemed a bit wet behind the ears			0
did he do badly ? by no means			0
he never lost his cool and he was n't rude			0
but with his youthful appearance , and his taking a back seat to @entity3 , @entity28 was overshadowed			2
@entity28 did nothing to win or lose the debate			2
@entity28 underperformed to @entity3 's over-performance			1
one way or the other , good and bad , it was @entity3 's show			1
