-- @entity1 may have its fair share of tourists seeking nothing more than seven days of sun , sand and sex in the southern party triad of @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 , but this only forms a small part of what 's on offer			1
in reality , @entity1 is a lush @entity18 island teeming with cultural experiences , delicious food and exhilarating adventures			1
for those after a little slice of @entity26 culture , food and adventure , consider the following , less - visited possibilities : 1			2
@entity1 : @entity29 good for : surf , seafood and spirituality @entity1 may be known for beaches and cornrows now , but it was the surfers who first discovered this beautiful @entity18 island			1
go south from @entity10 to @entity29 -- @entity29 to its friends -- and you 'll see what lured them here			1
@entity41 to @entity43 beach for the kinds of waves eager surfers dream of , or to @entity47 for some killer breaks around the reef			2
note however that @entity51 's fierce in this part of town			2
only experienced surfers should attempt to brave the waters around the @entity29			1
@entity0 : top 25 experiences in @entity1 & @entity57 explore @entity1 's spiritual side with a visit to @entity60 on the island 's south east			1
perched high on a cliff top , the temple has arresting views across the ocean that will leave you gob - smacked			1
( just do n't venture into @entity68 with any loose items dangling from you			2
the temple is awash with pick pocketing monkeys , and before you know what 's happened they 'll have scarpered with your best sunglasses			1
) a trip to the @entity29 is n't complete without visiting the @entity78 fish markets			1
early morning is the best time , as the market 's in full throttle for the day 's sales			2
finish the evening in @entity83 , watching the sun set at one of the picturesque seafood warungs ( casual food stalls )			1
there are three strips to choose from , with the southern section ( near the @entity91 ) generally agreed to be the best			2
watch out for high tide lapping at any belongings left on the ground			2
@entity95 good for : food , unique coffee and natural wonders @entity1 's famous for the delicacy of babi guling -- suckling pig -- and no place does it quite like @entity104 in the centre of @entity106			1
for a communal experience , join other diners on the warung right opposite @entity106 's palace			2
if you 'd prefer to sit , ask the staff to walk you a little further up the road to the ' secret ' warung			2
the prices are the same , but it 's a little quieter , a little plusher and a little more tucked away			0
nothing bonds people like a shared plate of succulently cooked pig skin			0
delish ! metered cabs are rare in @entity106 but there are plenty of drivers around vying for your business ( of mixed quality -- if you find a driver you like , get his number ! )			0
however , more adventurous souls might like to jump on the back of a scooter and zoom up and down the mountainside			0
better yet , from around @entity134 you can hire your own scooter			0
once you get the feel of the ebb and flow of traffic , you 'll be free to explore the beautiful scenery of @entity1 's mountains all by yourself			1
scooter 16km north to the @entity142 at @entity143 and marvel at the gentle beauty of rescued @entity146 elephants			0
do n't be fooled by imitations			0
the only legitimate conservation park is the one booked through @entity150			0
@entity0 : @entity1 's best spas and chill - out spots from @entity106 , hire a driver and head north to @entity154 to see the awe inspiring sight of @entity157 , @entity1 's second highest volcano			1
its last eruption was in 1994 , and traces of the black lava can still be seen			0
@entity162 it for the crater lake alone , it 's interesting to see the bustling of villages so close to a potentially murderous natural wonder			0
make sure you check up on volcanic conditions before you go			0
coffee lovers should stop en route to @entity154 at @entity171 to try kopi luwuk			0
famous for passing the coffee bean through the digestive system of a cat , this coffee retails for a whopping $ us50 a cup elsewhere -- here , you 'll get it at a steal for around $ us4			0
@entity181 , @entity182 and everywhere else good for : waterfalls , kite surfing and beach paradise cross through the mountain ridges at @entity188 , stopping for some sweet strawberries from one of the many roadside vendors			1
@entity41 north towards @entity192 , stopping to check out the @entity193			0
at @entity192 , enjoy the chilled out atmosphere among the black sand and seafood warungs -- just as fresh but much cheaper than @entity83 -- and revel in the lack of the tourist throng			1
if you can afford the time , make a little side trip to @entity202 , three natural hot springs open daily from 8am - 6pm			0
admission a steal at @entity204			0
on the east coast of @entity1 , @entity205 is much more laid back than beachside towns like @entity12 and @entity10 but it 's worth a visit -- particularly for those after the oceanic thrills of the former without the drunken revelry of the latter			1
@entity205 is one of the best places in @entity1 to try out kite surfing			1
strap yourself in and go away with the breeze ! if you can spare the time , there are few greater experiences than hopping a boat in @entity223 and heading east to the @entity224 for beach paradise			2
sure , we 're not in @entity1 any more , but it 's so close that you could be			1
rapidly gaining in popularity , it wo n't be long before the @entity230 are overrun with tourists seeking a blissful beach getaway with little to no responsibility , so get in quick			0
just northwest of @entity57 , the @entity230 are a 90 - minute boat ride from the east coast of @entity1			1
each island ( @entity236 , @entity237 and @entity202 ) caters to a different kind of traveler , but all three share the same untouched beauty			0
there are no cars allowed on the islands , so get used to cycling or walking			0
@entity0 : the world 's most unusual beaches Â© 2011 @entity0			0

while sun and sand often get top billing , @entity1 is teeming with cultural experiences
the @entity29 is known for *challenging* surfing and a scenic *seaside* temple
@entity205 is one of the best places in @entity1 to try out kite surfing
