any traveler who returns with mementos from their adventures might struggle deciding what exactly to do with them			0
perhaps that 's why astronaut @entity7 , the first man to step foot on the moon , left some of his personal artifacts from his journey to the moon in a closet			1
@entity7 's widow , @entity15 , found the items , and she snapped a picture of them that she shared with curators at the @entity21 's @entity20 , a release from the museum said			1
@entity7 , who uttered those now famous words , " one small step for man , one giant leap for mankind , " died in 2012 after complications associated with heart surgery			2
in the wake of his death , @entity31 donated many of the @entity36 artifacts to the museum 's @entity37			1
she also shared some of her husband 's correspondence and paper files to his alma mater , @entity43 in @entity44			0
not until recently did @entity31 email the museum with the news she 'd found , " a white cloth bag filled with assorted small items that looked like they may have come from a spacecraft			2
" with the email , she included a picture of the items , spread out on her carpet			0
most of the artifacts @entity31 had made available to the museum prior to her closet find , were n't any actual flown artifacts , but were still exciting , @entity60 the @entity62 curator at the @entity20 told @entity3			1
@entity31 's locating the bag and turning to the museum " to help determine the significance of the items it was an immense honor and challenge , " @entity60 said			2
the physical challenge of conserving and protecting the items , which @entity31 shipped to the @entity20 , along with the intellectual challenge of determining what they were led @entity60 to enlist a team of experts from the @entity76 ( @entity76 )			1
for a year , the team worked to document and understand the " function and significance of each of the items in the bag , " confirming recently that a few definitely came from @entity7 's @entity36 mission			1
the first they were able to verify was the white cloth bag in which the items were found			2
the temporary stowage bag was often called the " @entity89 purse , " named after @entity62 commander @entity90 , who suggested astronauts might need a place to temporarily stow items			0
evidence that the bag and its contents were a part of the moonwalk mission were confirmed through @entity7 's own words			1
he 's recorded as having said , " you know that that one 's just a bunch of trash that we want to take back -- @entity106 parts , odds and ends , and it wo n't stay closed by itself			2
we 'll have to figure something out for it			0
" but transcripts from the @entity76 provide evidence @entity7 alerted mission control to the bag of " odds and ends " on board before their return			0
this was imperative as the return trajectory calculations would have needed to accommodate the additional weight ( about 10lbs ) in order to allow the team 's safe re-entry to @entity125 , explained the curator in a blog post on the museum 's website			0
inside the bag was the camera that recorded @entity7 's landing on the moon , as well as his famous remarks upon his landing			1
the 16mm data acquisition camera was mounted in the window of the lunar module @entity139 and recorded historic images : @entity7 just before he stepped onto the moon			1
@entity7 planting the @entity143 flag with @entity144			0
also a part of the haul was a waist tether used by @entity7 to help support his feet during a rest period on the moon			0
astronauts used these tethers as security in case they were forced to do a spacewalk during orbit , the museum release said			0
these items are now on display as a part of the @entity20 's temporary exhibition , " outside the spacecraft : 50 years of @entity163			1
" @entity60 said the @entity7 artifacts " tell a number of stories " - the technical story that has been so carefully documented and the human story of those who were involved			2
" it was a most satisfying discovery process , " he said			0
a team of experts is still cataloging some of the items found inside to determine whether any others were a part of the @entity36 mission			1
