-- young women drove @entity4 's zombie - themed romantic comedy " @entity5 " to the top spot at the box office over @entity8 weekend , while @entity10 's @entity9 got tackled , leaving the action icon with the worst debut of his career			1
" @entity5 , " which was financed for about $ 35 million , earned an estimated $ 20 million from 3,009 theaters in its first three days			1
no , that 's not a twilight - sized number , but no one was expecting " @entity5 " to be the same sort of blockbuster			1
sure , they 're both about romances between a teenage girl and an undead boy , but the @entity26 novel upon which it is based is certainly popular , but it never experienced the utter ubiquity that the twilight books did			0
" @entity5 " opened with a bit less than the 2009 comedy " @entity32 , " which debuted with $ 24.7 million , but its star was in line with the debuts of both @entity37 and @entity38 , which opened on @entity8 weekend last year to $ 22 million and $ 20.9 million , respectively			1
much like the latter film , @entity5 played primarily to young ladies			1
according to exit polling , the film 's audience was 60 % female and 65 % under 25			0
" @entity5 " earned a solid " b + " cinemascore grade from crowds , and thanks to relatively strong reviews , its legs may not rot away as quickly as other teen - targeting titles , and a finish in the $ 50 - 60 million range seems likely			1
for star @entity53 , who has a slew of high profile releases — including @entity56 , @entity57 : @entity58 , and @entity59 : @entity60 — on the horizon , @entity5 is a nice start to his run as a leading man			2
in second place , last weekend 's champ @entity66 : @entity68 dropped 53 percent to $ 9.2 million , good for a $ 34.5 million total after ten days			1
@entity71 's long - on - the - shelf fairy tale adaptation cost $ 50 million			2
@entity72 held strong in third place in its 12th weekend			0
the @entity76 's $ 21 million @entity75 dramedy fell only 14 percent this weekend to $ 8.1 million , giving it an $ 80.4 million total			2
before this weekend , @entity72 had been running a touch behind @entity79 ( coincidentally , the closest @entity81 race — between @entity82 and @entity83 for @entity84 — is also the closest box office race ) , but @entity86 took a decisive lead over the last three days , and it 's still on track to finish above $ 100 million			1
@entity90 f - bomb heard on tv speaking of @entity93 , the red - haired beauty owned the rest of the @entity95			0
her @entity97 - produced horror flick @entity99 continued its lucrative run , dropping 49 percent to $ 6.7 million			2
after 17 days , @entity102 's $ 15 million film has earned $ 58.3 million			1
meanwhile , @entity93 's more serious vehicle , @entity79 , dropped 45 percent to $ 5.3 million			2
the film has earned $ 77.8 million total after seven weekends			1
warm bodies -- $ 20 million 2			1
@entity66 : witch hunters -- $ 9.2 million 3			2
@entity72 -- $ 8.1 million 4			2
mama -- $ 6.7 million 5			0
@entity79 -- $ 5.3 million the weekend 's other new wide release , @entity10 's r - rated action vehicle @entity9 , got off to an even worse start than @entity113 's @entity112 did two weeks ago			0
@entity9 debuted in sixth place with a terrible $ 4.5 million from 2,404 theaters and an underwhelming " b - " cinemascore grade			1
that 's @entity10 's weakest wide release debut ever			0
the last time a @entity10 film opening in over 500 theaters did worse was in 1981 , when @entity121 earned $ 2.5 million on opening weekend — and that was only from 659 theaters , about 30 percent of @entity125 's theater count			1
according to exit polling , the few crowds that did see the film were 60 percent male and 81 percent above the age of 25			0
@entity8 : funniest power outage tweets bullet is the fifth gun - toting action film targeting older men to disappoint at the box office in the past month			0
in recent weeks , @entity140 has earned $ 43.1 million versus a $ 60 million budget , @entity139 has grossed $ 18.2 million versus a $ 35 million budget , @entity112 has found $ 11.7 million versus a $ 45 million budget , and @entity144 has earned $ 12.4 million versus a budget of approximately $ 35 million			1
( when reached , @entity146 did not provide @entity0 with a budget for @entity9 , though reports claim it cost $ 55 million			0
) of course , each of these movies was poorly reviewed , and that may be the main factor in their poor performances , but the weak results also suggest that fantasy - free shoot - em - ups starring older men ( many of them @entity156 stars ) are n't connecting with viewers right now			0
yes , @entity160 is succeeding — it crossed $ 150 million this weekend — but that has a fantastical tilt to it			0
the overall trajectory does n't bode well for @entity164 ' @entity165 , which opens in two weeks			0
@entity168 's @entity167 also opened this weekend in 659 theaters , where it earned a paltry $ 1.5 million			1
the film stars @entity171 , @entity172 , and @entity173 , and it 's safe to say it wo n't be the biggest hit in any of their careers			0
