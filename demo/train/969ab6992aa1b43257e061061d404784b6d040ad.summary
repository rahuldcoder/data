editor 's note : @entity2 , @entity3 , is professor of psychology and psychiatry at @entity6 , founder of @entity8 , and author of " the political brain : the @entity11 in deciding the @entity12			1
" he has been a consultant or adviser to several candidates and organizations , including the @entity17 , and has informally advised the @entity19 campaign			0
@entity2 says @entity20 realized you need more than position papers to sway the voters			1
@entity24 , @entity25 ( @entity26 ) -- a single factor never produces a complex event like the historic election of @entity19			0
but when the final post-mortem on the election of 2008 is someday written , it will no doubt include at least three			0
first , @entity33 started with three strikes against him			2
those strikes happen to be the three strongest predictors that enter into the equations used by political scientists to predict who will win an election : an unpopular incumbent president ( in this case , the most unpopular in the history of polling ) , an economic downturn ( in this case an understatement ) , and an unpopular war			0
in some ways , @entity33 lost the presidency twice to @entity51			1
in the 2000 @entity53 primary , @entity33 was defeated by what have been generously referred to as " dirty tricks ; " and in the two - year run - up to the 2008 election , he allied himself with @entity51 and his policies to win his party 's nomination ( even referring to @entity51 as " one of our greatest presidents " ) , which was his undoing with independent voters in the general election			1
second , whether @entity33 rues the day he chose @entity67 ( who moved from the asset to the liability column around the same time @entity71 did ) , @entity72 no doubt rues the day she chose to become a small - town mayor instead of a community organizer			1
it was precisely the extraordinary capacity to organize people that allowed @entity19 and his chief advisers to bring such unprecedented numbers of people to the polls			0
not only was this the first election in recent memory in which @entity20 outgunned @entity85 with their get - out - the - vote efforts , but it was the first time since @entity89 recognized the potential value of television as a medium for advertising over 50 years ago that @entity20 have led @entity85 in technology			1
from the moment i met @entity19 's media wizard , @entity97 , 18 months ago , i realized @entity19 would have a tremendous advantage on that front , but i did n't realize by how much			2
but then there 's that other major factor : for the first time since @entity103 , the @entity20 chose a candidate with both the general intelligence to govern and the emotional and political intelligence to win			1
and they finally abandoned the approach to campaigning that has been their downfall for generations : peppering voters with facts , figures , and policy positions and assuming they will see what a rational choice the candidate is			0
we do n't choose any of the important people in our lives that way , whether spouses or presidents			2
@entity19 beat @entity33 the same way he beat @entity126 : by out - inspiring them , boxing them into the role of the candidate against hope , and defining himself as the candidate who represents change			2
and in the last few weeks of the campaign , @entity19 finally began to control the four stories that matter in an election : 1			0
the story you tell about your yourself ( that he was the candidate of change , fleshing out what he meant by change ) ; 2			0
the story you tell about your opponent ( that @entity33 was four more years of @entity51 ) ; 3			1
the story the other candidate is telling about himself ( @entity33 the maverick , which @entity19 countered by citing @entity33 's proud proclamation that he had voted with @entity51 over 90 percent of the time and parrying , " that 's not a maverick , that 's a sidekick " ) ; and 4			1
the story @entity33 was telling about @entity19 ( that he lacked the experience and judgment to lead , which @entity19 countered with his steadiness in the face of the @entity163 meltdown and his strong , steady performances in the debates )			2
elections are won by candidates who control those four stories and in so doing inspire the electorate and channel their fears ( in this case , fears about the economy trumping all else )			2
going forward , @entity19 needs to find his way as a leader between the excesses of the " permanent campaign , " in which a president remains in campaign mode throughout his presidency -- taken to its extreme under @entity51 , who allowed his political strategist , @entity181 , an inordinate role in crafting policies rather than just figuring out how to talk with the public about them -- and @entity19 's more natural predilection to talk like a law professor			1
what @entity20 learned from this election is that if their candidate thinks like a professor but inspires like a preacher , they can have their cake and eat it , too			1
president - elect @entity19 faces enormous mountains to climb that will require enormous public support			0
he will no doubt pursue the policies he considers best for digging our nation out of some deep ditches , both domestically and internationally			0
but the best policies do n't sell themselves , whether the date is november 3 or january 21 , and the style that led him to the @entity205 -- a calm , thoughtful , steady approach to policy combined with an extraordinary capacity to inspire -- is the same style that will make him an extraordinary leader			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : @entity33 was *burdened* by *bad* economy , @entity51 unpopularity
*democrats* had technological edge for first time in decades , @entity2 says
@entity2 says @entity20 learned you ca n't win with position papers , statistics
they dealt with people 's fears , mostly about the economy , @entity2 says
