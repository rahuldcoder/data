in recent weeks , hundreds of thousands of @entity0 have joined a growing chorus urging @entity4 sen. @entity3 to run for president			0
i am not endorsing her as a candidate , at this point			0
but i am excited about the movement that is pushing her candidacy , unlike a whole bunch of @entity14 types who have lined up to say how silly the whole notion is			2
@entity18 will not run , they cry -- though a draft movement has convinced her before			1
and even if she did , she would not win -- though no one gave president @entity22 a chance , either			2
still , even if all of the naysayers are somehow on to something , the folks supporting " @entity28 " -- @entity29 , @entity30 , and the @entity31 -- and " @entity32 " have it right			2
here is why : even @entity35 who support other candidates acknowledge that big banks and other special interests have rigged the game in @entity41			1
our whole party understands that inequality is worse than it has been since the 1920s , and we need to build an economy where everyone has a fighting chance			2
in fact , it is not just @entity35 voters who are emboldened by @entity18 's fight for working families ; her ideas ring true in red states and blue states , in rural parts of @entity0 and in big cities like @entity60 and @entity61			1
" i came out of a hardworking , middle - class family , " @entity18 often says , in some variation			1
" i came from an @entity0 that created opportunities for people like me , and i now see an @entity0 where the government works for people who already have money and power			0
" it is , in her own words , " time to remind politicians that they do n't work for the big banks -- they work for us			2
" that is a voice that would add real value to any party 's primary , but especially a party that purports to stand up for working people			1
contested primaries feature robust discussions on the most pressing issues facing our nation -- and the best ideas for making @entity0 stronger			1
now , more than ever , we need those discussions			0
many @entity35 are voting with @entity88 , while @entity89 shout about flat wages			1
our country and the @entity35 deserve a real debate over what we stand for			1
and there is a great place to have these debates : in states like @entity98 and @entity99 , where voters are ready to ask candidates tough questions and hear their platforms			2
in the absence of a competitive primary , some have even speculated that there may not be any @entity35 debates before the general election			1
call me old - fashioned , but i want to nominate a presidential candidate who has answered tough questions on the crucial issues facing hardworking @entity0 today			0
some argue that a vigorously contested primary would actually hurt the @entity35 , that a competitive primary could split the @entity35 base or force the eventual nominee to spend too much time and money too early			1
in other words , exactly what happened in 2008			0
remember how that worked out ? primaries leave candidates fit , tested , experienced and prepared for the grueling general election campaign			0
and as we saw in 2008 , all that organizing leaves the party energized and ready to get to work			0
the @entity89 primary will unquestionably be highly competitive			0
some analysts are predicting that more than a dozen @entity89 candidates will mount serious bids for the party 's nomination			0
the eventual @entity89 nominee will enter the general election in fighting shape , with months of experience winning debates and votes over his or her party allies			1
if the @entity89 contest features a spirited debate and the @entity35 primary generates no news , the result will be two years of free publicity for right - wing talking points and conservative attacks on president @entity22 's record , with a battle - ready @entity89 candidate			1
i have tremendous respect for @entity158			0
and so does most of the @entity35			2
but whether you love @entity161 , or would cast your ballot for @entity18 or someone else , your voice will not truly be heard unless the primary offers a choice			1
in 2014 , @entity35 played it safe , avoided offering big ideas and failed to motivate the voters who drove them to victory in 2008 and 2012			1
to win in 2016 , we need to have the progressive base fired up , with progressive causes at the forefront of the political debate			0
if we rely on those @entity35 diehards to win , they deserve an opportunity to make their voices heard during the primaries and caucuses			2
we are at a critical point in our nation 's history			0
millions of @entity0 are fighting for justice in their communities			0
millions of @entity0 are calling for economic policies that work for everyone , not just the wealthy few			0
millions of @entity0 are ready to tackle climate change , solve our student debt crisis and ensure women get equal pay for equal work			0
it is time to fire up the @entity35 base , have a robust discussion of the critical issues facing our nation and hear the best ideas from our best candidates .			1

@entity207 : a @entity18 candidacy would be good for *democracy* -- and @entity35
he says the party needs a contested primary , debates and a full airing of ideas
