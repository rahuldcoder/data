what makes a truly fun theme park ? is it the rides , the size of the budget , the staff in big - eared costumes hugging kids ? for @entity9 , who 's visited no fewer than 264 parks in 92 countries in his guise as " @entity13 " -- a self - funded roving reviewer of gated entertainment centers around the world -- it 's when all of the above combine to work their magic			1
" a great theme park is one you leave and do n't forget about instantly , " he tells @entity19			1
" i 'm really curious about the whole experience			0
" i wonder about the atmosphere that 's been created and what the vision for the park is			2
" the @entity27 - born @entity9 , who grew up in @entity28 and who has lived in @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 , says he judges a theme park not just on the quality of the rides but on whether the attraction 's creators achieved the vision and atmosphere they set out to create			1
" a good ride is like a good movie , it surprises you , " he says			0
" there should be at least one unexpected twist in the story			0
there are very few good rides out there in the world -- most are predictable			2
" a standalone ride on its own for me has little fun factor , i really like theme parks because they 're not fun fairs			1
" fun fairs are a collection of rides			2
a theme park is a gated experience , and the moment you pass through the gates you should be entering a different world			1
and if this world surprises or inspires you , then it 's fun			1
" here are @entity9 's top 10 " funnest " theme parks : 1			1
@entity67 ( @entity68 , @entity69 ) @entity9 says : " this park is based around a truly unique concept , with science fiction author @entity72 at its center			1
" @entity72 lived in the 19th century and wrote futuristic novels , and large parts of this park are modeled after the way he was imagining the future back then -- it recreates a future that 's never existed			2
" it 's impeccably themed with erupting volcanoes , giant drilling machines and @entity72 - themed rides			1
there 's also a @entity87 corner , an adventure / @entity89 corner and a @entity91 -- everything in the park is based on stories about the sea			2
" i love @entity98 parks , but @entity67 really stands out because it 's markedly character free			1
it has the @entity98 budget , talent and vision , but tells a completely different story than @entity105 and @entity106			2
" it 's a great collection of rides with the world 's best theming and you can really see a huge budget at work			1

@entity118 ( @entity119 , @entity120 ) @entity9 says : " this is n't too different from the other @entity118 park in @entity31 , but this is the better one			1
" it 's a casino resort , but you feel that the casino is just 2 % of the park and the other 98 % is slot machine - free fun , with meticulous theming and incredible attention to detail			1
" @entity133 has a wonderful combination of aquariums featuring huge tanks and a vast variety of fish with a beach resort and a very well - themed water park that 's completely up to @entity98 standards			1
" if you want a theme park vacation by the beach , this is the place to go			1
" @entity118 , 1 @entity146 , @entity118 , @entity120 ; +1 242 - 363 - 3000 ; @entity117 's full review 3			2
@entity148 ( @entity149 , @entity150 ) @entity9 says : " this simply is the original			1
just think about the entrepreneurship and risk - taking involved when @entity98 set this up			2
" he put a @entity27 castle at the end of an @entity157 high street and it became a role model for theme parks around the world until today			1
" in @entity162 and other places around the world they 're still copying what he did			2
" that park opened in 1955 and it changed so much , it basically created this industry , and visiting it and seeing a lot of the original structures still standing is a very special feeling			1

@entity172 ( @entity173 , @entity27 ) @entity9 says : " @entity172 is unique because it 's managed to create an immersive experience without using any major intellectual properties for support			1
" they 've created various lands based on @entity180 countries and the continent 's culture , history and architecture			0
" it 's a unique and great concept that is very successful and does n't need any film studios or cartoon characters			0
" it 's really good for people who do n't travel that much , they can come to @entity172 and experience all the different architecture and cuisines found throughout @entity180			0
" think world exhibition with rides and highly themed local villages			2

@entity199 ( @entity200 , @entity27 ) @entity9 says : " this park is housed in a huge hangar originally constructed to build cargo airships			1
" the company went bust before the first ship had ever been built , so they were left with the vast hangar some 50 kilometers south of @entity30 -- and no one knew what to do with it			0
" then a @entity212 investor came along and used it to create an @entity215 - themed indoor water park with a beach			2
" water parks with an @entity215 theme and palm trees and beaches are fairly normal , but when you see this place in the winter time with all the @entity27 and @entity225 and @entity226 sitting there in a tropical environment staring up at that gigantic ceiling , it feels like a @entity230 colony			2

@entity233 ( @entity234 , @entity235 ) @entity9 says : " this is a classic , @entity157 coaster paradise			2
it 's like being at a coaster trade show , with all the rides assembled			0
" if you talk about fun amusement parks based on roller coasters and thrill rides and your focus is not on stories or atmosphere -- this the greatest park to go to			1

@entity250 ( @entity251 , @entity252 ) @entity9 says : " i 've only been here before the @entity253 when the park was still under construction , but i 'm really looking forward to going back			1
" this is @entity252 's first ever theme park , and it 's an ambitious project with a big budget and quality rides imported from @entity180			1
" so many theme parks think they need an intellectual property , so they get characters running around , hugging the kids , but i think the creators can be much more bold and try something else , like theming it around the history of a country or region			1
" this is what they 've tried to do here -- create a window on @entity252			0
i 've been to @entity252 many times and i think it 's a super fascinating country			0
" for an amusement park - loving person this will certainly be a great place to see before exploring the rest of the country			2
" @entity252 needs more tourists and contrary to all the bad press they always get , @entity252 people are great hosts and it 's a joy to visit there			0

@entity291 ( @entity292 , @entity162 ) @entity9 says : " this huge theme park is @entity162 's answer to @entity98			1
" there 's two levels , seaside and mountain , connected with a really stunning funicular train , creating an amusement park spread over a vast area			0
i 've never seen anything as big as this except in @entity303			0
" not everything is the highest quality , but they have some good rides , many of them imported , and it 's just so big and spectacular , particularly the view from the top			0
" everyone who visits @entity313 and loves theme parks should make their way over there , it 's about 45 minutes from the @entity313 - @entity162 border by taxi			1

@entity323 ( @entity324 , @entity325 ) @entity9 says : " this is a very low budget theme park and that 's what makes it so much fun			1
when you combine low budget and the passion of the creators , sometimes beautiful things arrive			2
" the ghost train here is really scary			0
as you move forward everything brushes your face , the ghosts are practically falling into your car			0
" there 's such an overdose of ghosts and puppets , it 's one of the funnest things i 've ever done			0
" if anyone goes to @entity325 , first of all they should meet the people and experience the country , of course , but @entity323 in @entity324 is really worth the side trip			1
it 's really a beautiful experience			0

@entity362 's @entity361 ( @entity363 , @entity364 ) @entity9 : " this is another classic			2
i love the location , because it 's really in the middle of nowhere			0
" if you drive from @entity371 to @entity372 , right after the @entity364 border you see a lone casino and there 's a huge coaster sticking out of it			0
and , heck , that coaster is wild			0
" when you pass from @entity150 to @entity364 , laws differ wildly			0
you 're really crossing an open border and this coaster represents this in many ways			0
" you 've this ruthless ride standing in the desert that shakes you up before allowing you to continue to @entity372 to do all the things you ca n't do in @entity150			0
" i like the entrepreneurship of putting a casino and coaster in the middle of nowhere			0
if that entrepreneur is still alive , i 'd love to meet them			0

@entity9 , aka the @entity13 , travels the world in search of the best gated fun parks
@entity67 tops his list of favorites for " impeccable theming " that *includes* erupting volcanoes
the original theme park , @entity148 makes his list , as does @entity323 , a low - budget park in @entity325
