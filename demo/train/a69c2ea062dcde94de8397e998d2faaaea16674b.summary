@entity0 -- president @entity2 called monday for @entity3 to approve a $ 50 billion plan to begin upgrading the nation 's crumbling infrastructure , saying such an investment is vital to creating much - needed construction jobs and keeping the nation competitive in the global economy			1
in a @entity12 statement at the @entity13 , @entity2 called for bipartisan support when @entity3 returns after the november 2 mid-term elections so that the first phase of a proposed six - year infrastructure development plan can begin			1
" we 've always had the best infrastructure , " @entity2 said , noting that one in five construction workers are unemployed right now			1
" this is work that needs to be done			0
there are workers ready to do it			0
all we need is political will			0
" the president first announced the plan on @entity28 , and present and former @entity30 members as well as some governors and mayors around the nation joined him to support the initiative			2
despite their call , it remains uncertain if the issue can overcome the deep partisan divide in @entity3 , especially after an election expected to erode @entity41 majorities in both chambers or even return republicans to control			0
the main @entity43 campaign theme for the upcoming election has been excessive government spending under @entity2 and the @entity41 - controlled @entity3 that has failed to lower the unemployment rate below 9 percent			1
in particular , @entity43 say the $ 787 billion economic stimulus bill passed last year has failed to bring promised jobs and other economic benefits			1
@entity2 and @entity41 say the stimulus bill prevented the recession that began in the previous administration from worsening into a full economic depression			1
transportation secretary @entity55 responded sharply on that topic when questioned by reporters monday about whether new infrastructure spending would provide better results than the stimulus bill			1
noting that the $ 48 billion in stimulus money for the transportation sector funded 14,000 projects that employed thousands of people , @entity55 said that @entity65 know the bill worked " because they see their friends and neighbors working on roads and bridges and transit systems			1
" " the idea that our stimulus did n't work is nonsense , " he said			2
@entity77 gov. @entity76 , a @entity78 and strong @entity2 supporter , called stimulus spending on infrastructure " the single best job creator we can do in this country			1
" " it created well - paying jobs that ca n't be outsourced , " @entity76 said			0
" it 's just what the economy needs			0
" a study by the @entity91 and the @entity92 shows a majority of infrastructure - related jobs would come in the construction field , followed by manufacturing and retail			0
@entity55 added that @entity3 has traditionally passed transportation bills containing infrastructure investment with strong bipartisan support			2
" there are no @entity41 or @entity43 bridges or roads , " he said , adding that @entity41 rep. @entity100 of @entity101 , the chairman of the @entity102 , told him there is @entity43 support for new infrastructure investment			0
@entity2 and @entity55 said the cost of new investment would be paid for , rather than adding to the debt			2
however , @entity55 stopped short of offering specific ways to do so , saying only that a number of options were being considered			0
senior administration officials say private funds also would be used for the infrastructure overhaul			2
they suggested the $ 50 billion from @entity3 could be paid for by closing loopholes in the tax code related to oil and gas production or through other cost - cutting measures			1
