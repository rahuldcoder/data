-- i 've been teaching @entity2 in college for 40 years , and i 've never met a single professor who likes grading			1
" @entity9 " is too strong a word for what they feel			0
the fun stuff is talking to students , holding classroom discussions , thinking about your subject in complex ways and trying to convey your enthusiasm for the subject			1
education is about leading students in useful directions , helping them to discover their own critical intelligence , their own voices			1
now a company has come up with software that can grade our papers for us			1
@entity29 is a nonprofit company started by @entity30 and @entity31			0
it also creates online courses called @entity33 ( for massive open online course )			0
with this new software , students submitting their papers online can get immediate feedback : no more waiting until the lazy professor gets around to grading their work , probably leaving coffee rings and inky fingerprints on the pages			1
having a program grade papers would apparently free teachers to do other things , but i think it would be a mistake			1
why ? as a teacher , i may begin to understand students by their conversation or how they respond in class , but when they actually have to put their thoughts on paper , i can learn a huge amount in a relatively brief time			1
i can see how they think and feel in relation to the material before them , and if ( and how ) they have problems in making connections , marshaling arguments , drawing conclusions			0
needless to say , i can also get a sense of where they are with the material at hand			0
have they learned enough to progress to the next stage ? the truth is , students rarely come to college -- any college -- knowing how to write well			1
this takes a lot of what one of my old profs used to call " correction			1
" i remember sitting beside him in his office as he went over my papers			2
he would draw a red pencil through adjectives , suggesting that i find stronger nouns , not more bolstering words			0
do n't say it was a " long narrow street			2
call it an alley if it 's an alley			0
he also told me to get rid of those adverbs			0
get a stronger verb and you wo n't need an adverb , he would tell me			2
so do n't say : " he ran swiftly down the narrow street			2
" instead , try something like this : " he sped down the alley			0
" i learned from this guy how to put my sentences into a more active voice , how to subordinate clauses , to embed them in a rolling syntax , making thoughts more subtle , arguments more persuasive			0
real education lives in sitting side by side with a student , in the face - to - face exchange of ideas and feelings			2
but grading papers often represents the beginning of a good exchange			1
i think my best teaching moments have occurred off - stage , late at night			2
i would spot a problem in a student paper and respond at length , in writing , in the margins			2
this would lead to an affecting moment in my office , where the student would come back at me to discuss			0
the conversation would continue , often for a very long time			0
in some cases , for years			0
i do n't think any software program is ever going to replace people in education			1
it may offer some help , but it 's not the real thing			0
to paraphrase @entity144 , it 's the difference between lightning bugs and lighting			1
sometimes , we need the flash itself , even the jolt , to push us in the right direction			0
i do n't believe software , however sophisticated , will ever provide that kind of jolt			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity157 .			1

@entity157 : professors are not crazy about grading papers , but new software can do it for them
@entity157 says teachers learn a lot about students from grading papers
he says **computers** ca n't work with students one - on - one to correct writing habits , errors
@entity157 : **computers** *vs.* teachers is , as @entity144 said , difference between lightning bugs , lightning
