spray from @entity2 hits the faces of tourists and locals as they look down at @entity7 's most famous waterfall			1
the water acts as a wake - up call , but this spectacular sight is no dream			0
located on the border of @entity15 and @entity16 , tourists from all over the world arrive to witness the natural wonder			1
in 2013 alone , over 1.8 million people came to @entity15 on holiday according to the @entity20			1
that number may sound impressive , but tourism authorities say 2014 will be an even stronger year for the industry			1
" @entity15 is pumping when it comes to tourism , " says @entity24 from @entity15 's @entity25			1
" we 've picked up , gotten back to ... where we were in 1999 , and we are even surpassing the figures for 1999			0
" @entity24 has good reason to be optimistic -- the @entity32 expects tourism to make more money for the country in 2014 than any other year in the past decade			1
and recent figures also show hotels at @entity2 are enjoying solid business -- occupancy rates in the area reached 77.6 % in august , up from 62.6 % in the same period in 2013			1
troubled past but the tourism industry has been through tough times after its heyday in the 1990s			1
" it was the land invasions and the violence and the bad publicity that the country received , " says @entity43 of the organization @entity45 , explaining the industry 's slump			0
" [ @entity15 ] was perceived as a high risk country after that and tourism virtually stopped overnight			1
" shortly after the world welcomed in a new millennium , more than 2,000 white owned farms , of five million hectares , were targeted by the government for resettlement			0
while authorities insisted the program was sustainable , some white farmers were subject to violence , and lost their property to emboldened groups of black @entity15			2
economic meltdown since then , members of the international community -- including the @entity70 -- has imposed sanctions on @entity15 's president @entity72 and his inner circle			2
the chronic economic mismanagement that followed saw a period of hyper - inflation , and citizens at some point had to pay 300 billion @entity15 dollars for a loaf of bread			2
according to the @entity85 , " @entity15 is in debt distress as total external debt at the end of 2012 remains high at 70 % of gdp			2
" and these economic hardships hit the tourism sector hard			1
while over 2.2 million tourists arrived in 1999 , by 2005 that number was 1.5 million			1
the industry has seen a shaky recovery since then , but the hard times are still fresh in the minds of hotel owners and tour operators			0
" @entity25 shrank massively , " says @entity43			0
" a lot of people obviously folded , left town ... the rest of us just managed to survive ...			0
until [ the ] revival started again a couple of years ago			0
" improving infrastructure in a move to ensure the troubled days do n't return , @entity15 minister of tourism and @entity106 , @entity107 , has announced a $ 150 million plan to expand the airport at @entity2			1
the project , which will be financed with a loan from @entity113 , is boosting confidence amongst local business owners			0
" currently , the ... short runway limits us as to the number of people that can come in on a flight , " explains @entity116 , the manager of @entity117 -- one of the biggest hotels in @entity2			2
" the new 4 km ( 2.5 miles ) runway , the new terminal , which will be able to hold up to five wide bodied aircraft , new carousels , increased immigration offices , is going to make a huge difference to us ... with this we can increase the number of seats coming into @entity15 on a daily basis			1
" looking ahead but , as @entity137 data shows tourist numbers worldwide grew by 5 % in the first eight months of 2014 , renewed confidence in the @entity2 region is palpable			1
" i think @entity2 is on a goldmine , " says @entity139 from the cruise company @entity140			2
" it 's a beautiful location , and people are beginning to hear about it , and with @entity15 being much safer ... it 'll definitely pick up			2
" @entity43 from @entity146 , is also optimistic			0
" i think the future looks good			0
i think what we got to be careful of is that we do n't sort of over capitalize ... we do n't want to make it into another @entity151 where it 's over commercialized			0
but i do think that the future here is very bright			0
