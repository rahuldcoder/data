the list of names of black men killed by white men who have subsequently gone unpunished -- and in the case of @entity2 and @entity3 , untried -- continues to grow			1
in each of these cases , an ugly theme has been raised in defense of the perpetrators : the victims should have known better			2
why did @entity3 resist arrest ? why was @entity1 wearing a hoodie ? why did @entity2 not meekly get out of the street when ordered to by a police officer ? the reasoning goes that their deaths were triggered by their deeds ; they need to be held posthumously accountable for their conduct			1
when it comes to the actions of their white killers , however , the accountability hawks fall suddenly silent			2
in their eyes , accountability is apparently only for the dark - skinned ( for being " uppity " or vulgar ) , the poor ( for failing to bootstrap themselves into success ) , the recently immigrated ( for failing to " mainstream " into @entity38 society ) -- and , as we 've also seen , for women for failing to avoid sexual predators and @entity42 for being too blatant about their sexuality			0
a flagrant new example of this " accountability for thee , but not for me " sensibility emerged last week , when @entity52 reported that actor @entity53 -- one of @entity55 's most bankable leading men , who scored a staggering $ 16 million paycheck for his turn as a heroic father and inventor in the most recent " transformers " movie -- has petitioned @entity50 for pardon of his brutal assaults on a pair of @entity66 men , @entity67 and @entity68 , while a teenager in @entity49 , @entity50			1
the attacks were peppered with racial slurs ; he called @entity72 a " @entity77 f * cking sh * t " before smashing him in the head with a large club and knocking him unconscious , and he punched @entity68 so hard that he left him blinded in one eye			0
he repeatedly referred to both men as " slant - eyed gooks " while he was being arrested			0
@entity53 , who was 17 , was tried as an adult and served 45 days in jail for the crime			2
in the application he filed to the state 's @entity85 , @entity53 states that he has " dedicated myself to becoming a better person and citizen so that i can be a role model to my children and others " and that " receiving a pardon would be a formal recognition that i am not the same person that i was			1
" he claims that , despite his use of racist language , the race of the men was not a motivation for his crime , blaming instead the " influence of alcohol and narcotics			0
" ( @entity53 committed the assaults while seeking to steal two cases of beer from @entity72 's convenience store			1
) in a stroke of irony , he states that a major reason for seeking a pardon is the desire to expand his own burgeoning restaurant chain , @entity113 , whose licensing has been hampered by his record as a felon			0
so , young @entity53 , who would just half a decade later rise to fame as a rapper and a crotch - grabbing underwear model under the name " @entity53 " before successfully transitioning to acting , was let off with a trivial 45 - day sentence after battering an @entity125 man until he was permanently handicapped			0
three gold records , $ 200 million in wealth and untold fame and adulation later , he 's seeking absolution for his crimes , because , he writes , " troubled youths will see this as an inspiration and motivation that they , too , can turn their lives around			0
" the unwritten phrase that should follow @entity53 's assertion : " that is to say , so long as they 're white and their victims are not			1
" if a black , @entity143 or @entity125 youth under the influence of drugs and alcohol had put out a white man 's eye while trying to rob his store , it 's inconceivable that he would have been let off with such a light sentence ; implausible that he 'd have gone on to the kind of marquee stardom that @entity53 has obtained ; unlikely that he would have the sense of unvarnished privilege that is driving @entity53 's desire for a whitewashing of his record , if you 'll pardon the pun			1
according to the @entity159 , to this day @entity53 has never apologized or paid restitution to the victims of his crimes			2
he also has n't really acknowledged his pattern of bigoted language and racist violence , which included a separate episode in which he threw rocks at @entity38 schoolchildren while shouting that " black n * ggers " were unwelcome in his community			0
and he has never reached out to the @entity66 - @entity38 community or other communities of color with the kind of targeted charity and philanthropic presence befitting someone who was truly remorseful for the repulsive actions of his youth			1
and that 's the most gut - wrenching aspect of @entity53 's request , coming as it does in the wake of the repeated , unpunished killings of young black men and teens at the hands of white men			2
the darkest reactions to the deaths of @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 described the victims as hardened , bestial and irredeemably corrupted by casual drug use or records of petty crime			1
they were , in the coded language of these commenters , " thugs			0
" meanwhile , @entity53 , a wealthy white man with a more extensive criminal record than any of the black men mentioned above , has been described across mainstream media as a " troubled " youth who 's since made good			1
in the wake of the grand jury 's decision not to indict officer @entity208 for the choking death of @entity3 , the hashtag # @entity204 trended on @entity210 , featuring hundreds of white people sharing how their infractions were dismissed by police , while in many cases black friends were prosecuted for the same offenses			2
i noted at the time that the hashtag was " proof that there are two @entity220 : one that gets off with a wink			0
and one that just gets offed			0
" in that other @entity220 , white versions of @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 might well have gotten the chance to " make good " like @entity53 ; they might be the ones seeking to redeem their youthful indiscretions			1
sadly , no amount of pardoning will resurrect the dead .			0

@entity53 petitioned @entity50 for pardon of his brutal assaults of two men
@entity235 : there 's a double *standard* when we judge crimes committed by whites and blacks
in the cases of @entity3 or @entity2 , we ask accountability from the victims
@entity235 : with @entity53 , he has n't even show true remorse for the repulsive actions of his youth
