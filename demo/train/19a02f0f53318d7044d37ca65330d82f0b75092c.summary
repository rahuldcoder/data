-- bad luck , or just another step in @entity4 's fall from dominance ? the club 's share price may have recovered a little since last month 's $ 61 million marquee signing of @entity9 from @entity10 , but qualification for the lucrative @entity12 is looking further away than ever for beleaguered manager @entity13			1
@entity9 helped @entity4 win on his debut against lowly @entity15 in midweek , but the @entity16 could not stop his new team crashing to a 2 - 1 defeat at unfancied @entity19			1
it means fourth - placed @entity21 can move nine points clear of @entity4 in the @entity23 on sunday with a win at struggling @entity25			1
table - topping @entity26 , meanwhile , will go 16 points ahead of @entity4 with victory over second - placed @entity10 on monday			1
@entity13 has had a tough time since replacing @entity30 , the most successful manager in the history of @entity33 football , and he was left bemoaning his fortunes after losing two players to injury and conceding a wickedly - deflected free - kick			1
however , while @entity42 's first goal may have been fortuitous , his second -- which made @entity40 's equalizer redundant -- was a moment of magic as the @entity46 midfielder smashed in a 25 - yard thunderbolt			2
it was @entity4 's eighth league defeat in 24 matches , compared to just five in 38 in @entity30 's championship - winning farewell			1
this is the club 's worst run in the top flight since the 1989 - 90 season			2
" we played well today , " a defiant @entity13 told @entity56			2
" we 're definitely not getting a lot of good fortune going our way , but we 've got ourselves to blame for the opportunities we missed			0
" i think the free - kick summed it up			0
that went in after we 'd controlled the majority of the game			0
i think it was going wide , but it took a wicked deflection and went in			0
that 's when you know that your luck is n't in			0
it 's just not going for us			0
" it was a difficult day , the conditions were tough			0
we had opportunities to get at least a draw and they scored a world - class second goal which was hard to defend against			0
" while @entity4 's attack has been bolstered by the arrival of @entity9 and the return from injury of last season 's top scorer @entity86 and @entity89 striker @entity88 , @entity13 ' defensive options are looking thinner after @entity90 was stretchered off before halftime and fellow center - back @entity93 suffered a calf injury			1
he was unconscious for a period during the game , but he 's had a head scan and the hospital has checked him and there were no problems , " @entity13 said			2
it was @entity19 's first league win against @entity4 since 1984 , when manager @entity103 was a 20 - year - old striker playing for the @entity105 side			1
his team leaped out of the bottom three up to 11th in the table after winning just its sixth game			0
" that tells you how crazy the league is at the moment , " said @entity103 , whose side are just six points above bottom club @entity111			0
@entity13 ' former team @entity116 , meanwhile , moved up to fifth place -- which would secure a spot in the second - tier @entity120 next season -- with a 2 - 1 win over @entity122			1
@entity124 forward @entity123 fired in a superb 85th - minute free - kick as @entity116 bounced back from last week 's 4 - 0 drubbing by @entity128 rivals @entity21 , with substitute @entity129 equalizing @entity131 's first - half opener for the 10th - placed visitors			0
@entity133 , beaten 5 - 1 by @entity26 in midweek , dropped to sixth after being held 1 - 1 at @entity134			2
@entity137 midfielder @entity136 , returning after a month sidelined by injury , canceled out new signing @entity139 's opener for the home side			0
@entity142 failed to join seventh - placed @entity4 on 40 points after losing 3 - 0 at home to northeast rivals @entity145 , who completed a derby double and continued a resurgence under manager @entity149 by moving up to 14th			1
@entity150 consolidated ninth place with a 3 - 0 win at @entity111 , who dropped to the foot of the table despite fielding two new loan signings , @entity158 midfielder @entity157 and @entity133 's @entity160 international @entity159			2
@entity162 's relegation battle was boosted by a 2 - 0 win at @entity164 that left the @entity166 team third from bottom , but star striker @entity168 was sent off after setting up both goals for @entity170			1
former @entity4 striker @entity171 enjoyed his first win in charge of @entity15 , beating @entity174 2 - 1 , but the @entity176 club was still left second from bottom .			1

@entity13 suffers eight defeat in 24 league matches in charge of @entity4
*saturday* 's 2 - 1 loss to @entity19 was @entity4 's first in the league to that team since 1984
manager @entity13 blames bad luck and poor finishing in front of goal
reverse means @entity4 may fall nine points behind fourth place by end of weekend
