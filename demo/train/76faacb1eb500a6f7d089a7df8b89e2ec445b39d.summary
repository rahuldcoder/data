it might be one of the world 's worst polluting energy sources , but coal has allowed @entity5 to become the continent 's largest economy , according to the chief executive of the country 's power utility company @entity9			1
speaking to @entity13 's @entity12 , @entity9 's @entity11 said coal has been key to fueling @entity5 's economic growth and improving the lives of many in the country			1
" we 've been very successful in the use of coal in growing one of the largest economies , in bringing electricity to the majority of @entity5 -- we 're absolutely not defensive about it , " said @entity11			1
@entity5 gets 86 % of its energy from coal and , despite the criticism that it is bad for the environment -- when burned , coal emits more air pollution and greenhouse gases than other major energy sources -- dames argued that @entity5 will continue to use the natural resource			1
an edited version of the interview follows below			0
@entity13 : why is coal important for @entity5 ? @entity11 : it 's about energy security first and foremost for us , it 's about affordable energy , it 's about energy access			1
you would agree with me without those three things there is no economic growth , no poverty alleviation , no job creation in any of our economies			0
and then it is about , as we do this , how we can do it in a more cleaner manner and at the same time make sure we deal with issues such as job creation -- can we create green jobs -- so we 're very clear as to where we want to go and what the balance is and that commitment is there -- it is there to move towards a lower carbon footprint over time			1
read more : is @entity5 addicted to coal ? @entity13 : what percentage of energy do you get from coal ? @entity75 : it 's more than 80 % , about 86 % of the energy , and it has put us in a position as a company and as a country to really fuel the economic growth in @entity5			1
that 's why this country has got the largest economy on the @entity87 continent , that 's why we operate one of the world 's 10 largest power companies			2
@entity13 : eighty per cent of all your energy comes from coal -- that is dirty energy and @entity5 is the biggest producer of coal in the world			1
do n't you find that difficult in terms of charting a green future ? @entity75 : no , it is not difficult			0
we should be quite clear , because @entity5 's emissions is about 1.5 % of global emissions , the continent 's emissions is about 3 % of global emissions , it 's less than 200 times than what 's in the @entity112 what you 're asking us to do is not do that , not have electricity , not have energy security and not have energy access			1
@entity13 : i think the reality is @entity9 relies heavily on coal , @entity5 historically has relied heavily on coal to produce its electricity			1
why do you seem a bit defensive about it ? @entity75 : no , we 're not defensive , absolutely not			0
coal has been used very successfully and will be used in future in @entity5			2
it 's a natural resource that we have , we 've been very successful in the use of coal in growing one of the largest economies , in bringing electricity to the majority of @entity5 -- we 're absolutely not defensive about it			1
banker : spending on climate change makes good business sense @entity13 : but it is dirty energy and there is an excess of reliance on coal			0
@entity75 : it 's not a question of being defensive , it 's a question about the ill - informed , because you want us as a country to be cleaner and not have electricity and energy and that is a problem			0
@entity13 : that 's not what i 'm saying , it 's a fact that @entity5 relies heavily on coal			1
@entity75 : it is a fact and successfully have done so			0
we 've said clearly growth is important , we have said clearly that we 're committed to a low - carbon future over time , so it is not growth at all costs			2
@entity5 has got a very clear path and strategy and is fully committed to deal with that			2
@entity5 has made very clear commitments in terms of its co2 emissions			2
@entity5 has also made it very clear that it is a developing country that must grow , that we must see the establishment of funding to make sure that it is available for us to do so			2
we have a clear path as to how we make sure we grow and how we make sure we respond to the needs of the environment and as a country and as company we 're fully committed to that			0
@entity13 : is nuclear still a very big part of your plans ? @entity75 : @entity5 has produced a 20 - year energy electricity plan and that plan has got an inclusion of nuclear			0
that plan says , of the additional capacity of the next 20 years , 42 % of it will be renewables , 23 % of it will be nuclear , because we do have requirement for base - load energy			0
we ca n't stall electricity -- nuclear as a base - load energy option is a viable option for this continent and again , coming back to my previous point , no one option , whether coal or renewables or hydro will solve our energy problems in the future			0
we need a combination of all of it , and including nuclear for that matter .			0
