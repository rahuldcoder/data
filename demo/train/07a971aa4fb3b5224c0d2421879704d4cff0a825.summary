-- in january 1999 , @entity2 prime minister @entity1 announced on live television that he was firing his defense minister , @entity4			1
the minister , @entity1 argued , had colluded with his political rivals and was aiming to undermine the prime minister 's authority			1
@entity4 would go on to lead a centrist party and play a pivotal role in the victory of @entity12 and the @entity13 over @entity1			1
fifteen years later , and @entity1 has again taken to the airwaves , announcing the firing of two senior @entity17 members			1
is history set to repeat itself ? on tuesday , @entity1 accused finance minister @entity20 and justice minister @entity21 , the main centrist leaders of his center - to - far - right coalition , of disloyalty and of undermining his authority , publicly criticizing his policies and conspiring to form an alternative coalition			1
as a result , @entity2 now heads to elections , tentatively scheduled for march			2
if you 're scratching your head and wondering , " did n't @entity2 hold elections recently ? " then you 're not alone			2
this @entity33 , the 19th , will be one of the shortest serving parliaments in @entity2 's 66 - year history			2
as a result , just two years after they last headed to the polls , @entity2 voters and politicians are wondering aloud why these elections are necessary			0
but will the outcome of the elections resemble those of 1999 , which prompted @entity1 to take a hiatus from political life ? @entity1 is a leader with remarkably few confidants , and has never excelled at the art of personal politics			1
after three terms as prime minister , " @entity1 fatigue " has set in across the political spectrum and even within his own party , and some have already suggested the election is effectively a referendum on the country 's leader			1
and in some ways , @entity1 really is vulnerable			1
@entity21 and @entity1 had clashed over a " basic law " ( akin to a constitutional amendment ) to reaffirm @entity2 's status as the nation state of the jewish people , a bill that attracted scathing critiques from , among others , president @entity68 ( of @entity1 's own @entity70 party ) , and his predecessor @entity71			1
@entity20 and @entity1 clashed over measures to deal with the politically explosive issue of the high cost of living and a growing wealth gap between @entity2			1
but perhaps most importantly , security issues -- especially the dramatic erosion of @entity2 ' sense of personal security over the past six months -- have undermined @entity1 's position			1
after all , he has long prided himself on the relative calm during his years as prime minister			0
and , though hawkish , @entity1 had been far more hesitant to go to war than some of his more dovish peers			1
yet in the aftermath of the lengthy conflict in @entity88 last summer , some @entity2 were disappointed with @entity1 's decision not to topple @entity90 , which strengthened the political hand of right - wing leaders like minister of the economy @entity93 of the @entity69 , a former aide of @entity1 's who left the prime minister 's office amid acrimony , and foreign minister @entity100 , another former aide and ally of @entity1 whose relations with the prime minister have seen several ups and downs			1
this has occurred against the backdrop of a wave of terrorist attacks against civilians , most notably a gruesome attack on a synagogue in @entity111 , midprayer , which left five dead			0
a palpable sense of personal fear is apparent and , naturally , nothing motivates voters more			0
all this said , this is not 1999			0
when then - defense minister @entity4 left the @entity70 , he joined a cascade of respected , veteran leaders who had broken with the young , brash and inexperienced prime minister			0
fast forward to today , and it is the veteran @entity1 , a steady hand and a known commodity ( for better or worse ) who is firing a brash , inexperienced @entity20 in the name of proper governance			1
the reality is that while public opinion currently holds @entity1 at fault for the political crisis , it remains at a loss as to who might replace him			1
in general , in democracies , incumbents lose more than challengers win ; when leaders are replaced it is usually because the voters are fed up with their reigning leaders			0
and yet , for a change of leadership , there must be a credible challenger there to pick up the pieces			0
instead , today -- by attrition and political longevity -- @entity1 has found himself seemingly alone as a major player in the political sphere			1
the challenge for the opposition is therefore formidable			0
the @entity2 public has moved to the right and , with every terrorist attack , the hawkish camp solidifies its advantage			0
the most likely outcome , at present , would be a new @entity1 government with a stronger right wing and religious base , including the @entity163 parties that were shunned from this coalition at @entity20 's demand			2
@entity1 may even bring weakened centrist figures back into the coalition , having lost their veto power in parliament			2
indeed , even those dismissed this week by @entity1 have so far refused to promise that they will not join another @entity1 coalition			2
and yet , a @entity1 defeat is not out of the question			2
he is the clear front - runner , but the campaign has barely begun , and party alignments are still unclear			0
@entity21 may well join forces with either @entity20 or with @entity13 ; a new party of former @entity70 minister @entity179 has yet to truly form but already shows considerable promise			0
in addition , several new entrants are expected in the political sphere as well , some of whom have impressive resumes in security , diplomacy and academia			2
it is by now a @entity191 © to call an @entity2 election the most important ever			0
instead , it is most likely that the outcome will be a continuation , or even accentuation , of current @entity2 policy			0
but with the dramatic challenges @entity2 faces , domestically , regionally and internationally , expect the sense of malaise in @entity2 politics to deepen			0
these elections may simply be a prelude to a deeper political crisis .			0
