-- two words are nowhere to be found in the pages of text that spell out a new interim nuclear deal with @entity5 : @entity6			1
now some supporters of the @entity9 pastor , who 's been detained in @entity5 for more than a year , are accusing @entity9 officials of betraying @entity6 by signing off on an agreement that does n't get him out of prison			1
" we were across the table from the @entity5 , and we did not bring home @entity9			2
to me that 's a tragedy and that 's outrageous , " said @entity16 , the chief counsel of the @entity17 , which represents @entity6 's family in the @entity9			1
while analysts debated the nuclear agreement 's pros and cons , @entity6 's wife , @entity21 , said she was trying to comfort her two young children			1
" it 's very painful , " she told @entity0 's " @entity28 " on monday			2
" my kids were crying this morning , saying , ' @entity30 , do n't let daddy die			0
' " @entity6 , a 33 - year - old @entity9 citizen of @entity5 birth , was sentenced to eight years in prison earlier this year , accused of attempting to undermine the @entity5 government and endangering national security by establishing home churches			1
at the time , an @entity5 state news agency said he would soon be released on bail -- but @entity6 's family says he remains behind bars in a dangerous prison , wrongfully imprisoned because of his @entity43 faith			1
family members who visited him in prison recently said his health had deteriorated , @entity44 said			0
and @entity9 officials should do more to push for his release , she said			1
" i expect them to speak out and say , ' we asked for his release , and this is horrible what has happened , ' " she said			0
" and he 's not going to survive even a few months in that prison			1
" @entity9 president @entity57 pushed for the release of @entity6 and two other detained @entity9 -- @entity59 and @entity60 -- when he spoke on the phone with @entity5 president @entity62 in september			1
it was the only issue other than @entity5 's nuclear program that @entity57 brought up , @entity64 deputy national security adviser @entity63 said			1
" he asked for @entity62 's assistance in freeing them and allowing them to return to the @entity9 , and @entity62 said that he would look into it , " @entity63 said			0
asked why @entity6 's fate was n't part of the interim nuclear deal with @entity5 , @entity73 spokeswoman @entity72 said the @entity79 talks " focused exclusively on nuclear issues			1
" @entity64 officials told @entity0 that negotiations for @entity6 and other detained @entity9 in @entity5 are ongoing			1
" we 've been repeatedly clear that we 're calling on @entity5 to release them , " @entity63 said			1
" the president ' raised it , we will continue to raise it , and we hope to see them return home			0
" one analyst told @entity0 monday that focusing on nuclear policy was the right approach for the talks			0
" in any negotiation , you 've got to decide how much you 're going to try to accomplish , and just tackling all the dimensions of the nuclear agreement is ambition enough , " said @entity92 , president of the @entity93			0
but @entity44 and her attorney argued that officials could have done more , making the @entity9 ' release a precondition for any sanctions relief			2
" it is disheartening and discouraging that fighting for religious freedom and wrongful imprisonment of a @entity9 citizen is no longer a priority for a country that was founded on such values , " she said in a written statement to @entity0			0
@entity6 converted to @entity43 from @entity114 and then became a pastor , living in @entity116 , @entity117			2
he regularly made trips to @entity5 and was working on a government - approved orphanage when he was arrested last year , his family said			2
he was on a bus crossing from @entity123 into @entity5 last summer when immigration officials took away his passport			2
he was later put under house arrest			0
authorities took him to the notorious @entity128 in september 2012 while he awaited trial			0
in january a judge from the @entity132 's @entity131 sentenced him to eight years in prison			2
on a @entity136 page dedicated to pushing for @entity6 's freedom , dozens of supporters criticized the nuclear deal and said they were praying for the pastor 's release			1
" it 's so senseless that our government would betray an @entity9 citizen like this ... especially under these unique circumstances			0
... they had the opportunity , " @entity147 wrote			0
@entity6 's wife said monday that she wo n't stop fighting for her husband 's freedom			1
