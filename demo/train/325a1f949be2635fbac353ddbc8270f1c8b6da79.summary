-- as a child , i thought growing up in a slum near a dumpsite in the @entity5 was as normal a life as an ordinary kid can have -- until i mingled with people from different social classes			1
the feeling of being unwanted tore my heart out , and i grew to feel so sorry for myself			2
i was looked down upon and discriminated against because of my appearance in cheap secondhand clothes and old shoes			2
i wore the same pair of shoes for more than 10 years , lining the sole with a plastic bag so the water would n't seep into my feet			2
because of the way i looked , i was often bullied by gang members verbally and at times physically , with others hitting and shoving me			1
i felt different , powerless and socially isolated			2
watch a preview of the 2010 @entity24 i was then focused on one thing : revenge ! i kept those feelings to myself and it consumed me little by little , until my heart grew cold and i wanted to give up everything			1
i almost quit school because i was afraid			2
i thought of joining a gang to strike back at the bullies			1
i was lost , troubled and crying my heart out but nobody heard , no one seemed to care			2
i got so lost that i could n't even find my way back to peace and happiness until @entity39 answered the desire of my heart			1
i was 13 when i met a man who became my friend , mentor , teacher and somewhat like a father			1
he helped me pick up the broken pieces of my life , which eventually healed my broken spirit			2
that mentor guided me and helped me change my perspective about a lot of things			1
he taught me that the quality of life is more dependent on our perspective than our circumstances , that the value of being is more dependent on our character than on our achievements -- and that the worth of our existence is more dependent on how we live life than on how long we survive			2
my mentor taught me that if i struck back with revenge against those who harmed and threatened me , it would just worsen my situation			1
so he introduced me to several volunteer activities , from distributing sandwiches to prisoners to building houses for less fortunate families to working in youth empowerment programs			0
i felt good about what i did , especially when people appreciated those small efforts			0
during those moments , i discovered my responsibility to other people and i slowly developed a heart that has a desire to help and reach out to those who are being bullied and discriminated against			1
my mentor encouraged me to think of a positive way to get back at those who bullied and put me down , not by violence but by competition			1
at 16 , he helped me and my friends create @entity88 as an alternative club for students on campus and in communities , a way to stop bullies and school gangsters from victimizing and terrorizing more students			0
our main purpose is the exact opposite of that of the bullies and gang groups -- to care , show love and acceptance by making a small yet significant difference in school , in our family , toward our friends and the people around us , and to use our time , skills , talents , strength and energy in more productive activities			0
our goal was to show that that there is strength in numbers and that goodness should triumph over wrongdoing			0
our crusade against the acts of bullies and gang groups has reached the slums and depressed areas in our town , where many kids are groomed and trained as early as 9 years old to become a gangster			0
we were able to save children from this fate and help them become an asset to build a better community			0
we put an emphasis on using education and faith to help every child to have a better and decent life			1
this has become our mission			0
there are plenty of kids all over the world who are going through the same things as i did			0
and , even though we may feel helpless sometimes , there are a lot of things we and others can do to help stop bullying and gang violence			1
the role of adults , parents and mentors makes a big difference in combating this issue			0
children must be loved , protected and given proper guidance			0
good old family values should be strengthened			0
education and learning is not the sole responsibility of the school , but a concern of the family and society as well			1
love for learning will open new doors of opportunities to everyone			0
we should remember that all adults are in some ways teachers to children who watch us and copy our beliefs , acts and lifestyle			0
we want to create an environment where children can express themselves in a conduct that is loving , accepting and respecting of others , so that they may grow up to be assets and not liabilities to society			0
