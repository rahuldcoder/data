@entity0 -- although all 435 @entity4 seats are up in november 's midterms , redistricting has reduced the number of swing races and made it easier for political watchers to keep up with those seats truly up for grabs			1
but redistricting has made it more difficult for @entity13 to retake control of the chamber for the first time since 2010			1
with fewer seats in play , they must capture 17 held by @entity21			1
adding to the challenge for @entity13 is that a traditionally older midterm electorate tends to favor @entity21			1
regardless , they are still making a play and @entity21 are defending their turf			1
here are 5 key races to watch : 5 @entity29 races to watch in 2014 @entity30 13 take a vacant @entity4 seat in a swing district in a purple state and you get what many see as a march 11 special election that could serve as a bellwether for midterms			1
the national political spotlight will shine on the 13th @entity41 race to fill the remainder of the term of @entity44 rep. @entity44 of @entity30 , who died in october			0
the district covers most of @entity46 and parts of @entity48 and it 's up for grabs : while @entity44 grabbed 58 % of the vote in his 2012 re-election , president @entity51 narrowly carried the district			1
@entity51 also won it 2008 , grabbing 51 % support			1
" it almost goes without saying , but this is the type of seat and race @entity13 have to win in order to have any chance of gaining the 17 seats they need in 2014 to get back to the majority , " wrote @entity57 , deputy editor of the @entity58			1
@entity68 , the former chief financial officer of @entity30 and the 2010 @entity13 gubernatorial nominee , is her party 's consensus candidate			1
@entity71 , who served as a former general counsel for @entity44 and also worked as a lobbyist , will face off against state sen. @entity74 in the january 14 @entity21 primary			2
@entity76 2 a rematch in swing district in southern @entity76 will receive plenty of national media attention in 2014			0
@entity13 rep. @entity81 is running for re-election in the @entity84 area district that he won by less than 2,500 votes in 2012			2
@entity81 will face off against the same @entity21 challenger he edged out last time - retired @entity88 col. @entity87			1
the top 12 campaign questions of 2014 while @entity81 came out on top in the 2012 contest , @entity21 nominee @entity90 narrowly captured @entity76 's 2nd @entity41 in the presidential election			1
it 's been in the headlines the past four years			0
@entity13 rep. @entity96 pushed back against the @entity21 wave in the 2010 midterms and won re-election			1
but two months later , @entity96 was seriously hurt in a shooting that left six people dead			0
she left @entity102 in 2012			0
@entity81 , a top @entity96 aide and who was also injured in the shooting , won the special election to succeed her			0
@entity13 are determined to keep the seat , but @entity21 see it as a prime pickup opportunity			1
@entity107 6 this is a race in the @entity109 that could produce a lot of intrigue			0
incumbent @entity113 has held the solidly @entity13 @entity107 seat since 1997 , but nearly lost it in 2012 after his wife 's conviction for her role in her brother 's illegal gambling venture			2
displeased @entity13 saw an opening after @entity122 's narrow victory , so now he faces a primary test from @entity124 , a @entity125 who served four tours in @entity127 and has been able to raise a significant amount of money			2
the primary winner could face @entity122 's rival last time out , @entity21 @entity131			2
he is a longtime state legislator and would be the first openly gay member of the @entity21 to be elected to @entity102			2
mostly ignored , shifts emerge in the politics of poverty @entity136 2 there is no question that a @entity21 is going to win this race but who will it be ? the contest in @entity136 's 2nd @entity41 illustrates the deep friction within the @entity21			1
incumbent @entity143 has served in the @entity4 for 14 years , leads an @entity145 subcommittee , and is a close friend of speaker @entity147			2
but the @entity149 wing of the @entity21 wants him out			2
the influential outside group , @entity150 , has listed @entity151 as one of its primary targets			0
one of the many things it does n't like about him is his vote to reopen the government following the 16 - day shutdown in october			2
the group is backing @entity149 activist and @entity162 attorney @entity161			0
but @entity151 has his friends			0
the @entity164 , run by former rep. @entity165 , has vowed to spend $ 1 million dollars helping him win re-election			0
when moderates fight back : @entity21 civil war could be brutal in 2014 elections " this may 2014 @entity21 primary has already turned into an all - out proxy war between the @entity21 's ideological purists like the @entity150			1
and speaker @entity147 , " @entity174 wrote			0
this is likely to be one of the most expensive - and closely watched - primary @entity4 races			1
@entity178 10 this electoral mood in the central @entity178 district currently favors @entity21 incumbent @entity181			2
but this race is interesting because it could be closely tied to what happens -- or does n't happen -- in @entity0 this year			0
the 10th @entity41 includes the city of @entity185 and parts of the @entity187			0
it is largely farm land			0
more than 40 % of its residents are @entity192 , so immigration reform is going likely to be a critical factor for these residents			0
4 ways immigration reform could happen - or not @entity181 has been pushing fellow @entity197 to take up the issue but its fate is uncertain			0
bee farmer @entity200 has already jumped in the race , running as a @entity202 , and @entity181 's 2012 challenger , @entity203 , the first @entity192 @entity204 astronaut in space , could also be a factor			0
while @entity51 won the district with just over 50 % of the vote , @entity174 predicts the electorate will be more @entity21 in a non-election year			1
@entity211 mention ... @entity212 4 the election in @entity212 's @entity214 will be in the national spotlight not because it 's considered a close contest - it 's not - but because of the candidate who 's expected to come out on top come november			2
@entity21 @entity219 , an @entity220 , lost the 2012 race in the district that stretches from central @entity212 to the southern suburbs of @entity224 to longtime @entity13 rep. @entity225 by less than 800 votes			1
@entity219 , who had the support of tea party activists and other grassroots conservatives , was featured prominently by the national party with a prime speaking slot at the 2012 @entity21 convention			1
@entity219 announced in 2013 that she would once again challenge @entity225			0
but last month , @entity225 announced he would retire at the end of his term , making @entity219 the instant frontrunner			0
if everything goes as scripted , the @entity4 will say hello to its first - ever black female @entity21			1
your district want to know who his running for your district 's @entity4 seat ? go to @entity243 and type in your zip code			0
all of the candidates will be listed .			0

all 435 @entity4 seats are up in midterms and @entity13 must win 17 @entity21 seats to regain control
the tea party is mounting a challenge against senior *republicans*
