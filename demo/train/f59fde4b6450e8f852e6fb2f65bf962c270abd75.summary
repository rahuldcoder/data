@entity0 -- in the midst of @entity5 's agonizing slide last week , there was at least one place in @entity7 where the liquor was flowing , the cigar smoke was billowing and the theme of the evening was simple : work hard			1
" i was a crook , " says @entity11 , once a @entity5 fat cat who made $ 1 million a week before going to jail			1
" it 's like fiddling			2
@entity20 fiddled while @entity21 burned , " said @entity17 , vice president and producer of @entity19			2
" we 're smoking cigars while we 're losing our shirts , literally			2
" he was among hundreds of mid-level @entity5 executives and traders gathered for a party thrown by @entity31 magazine , published by @entity0 - based @entity32			1
and if they seemed a little tone - deaf about how this kind of event could be perceived as millions of dollars were lost , at least on paper , most did not seem especially concerned			2
" it is a great time , " said @entity38 of @entity39			2
" i think for at least a couple of hours in the evening , we can kind of sit back , have a few drinks , forget what 's facing us on the @entity5 tomorrow			1
" few of the men and women at the party earned millions in @entity5 bonuses on top of their salaries			1
but nearly all did very well , they say , at the top of the @entity5 bubble			1
and their bosses , along with those who managed @entity5 hedge funds , did even better			1
" these guys were spending more than $ 250 billion a year , " @entity57 said			2
" they bought mansions in @entity60 and @entity61			0
they bought art for $ 100 million a painting			1
" @entity57 , author of " @entity65 , " says the enormous amounts of money earned by @entity5 elite made them practically a nation unto themselves			1
" they just looked at the guy with the bigger house , the nicer @entity73 , the better artwork , " he said			0
" and it was all competitive spending			0
" one prominent example is the ceo of @entity78 , @entity77			1
in 2007 alone , according to the executive compensation firm @entity79 , he earned total take - home compensation of more than $ 45 million in salary and bonuses			1
congressional researchers said he earned nearly $ 500 million from 2000 through 2007			1
@entity77 told @entity84 that the failure of his company centered on inaction on the part of government and a loss of confidence in the financial markets			0
" this is a pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life , regardless of what comes out of this committee , regardless of when the record books get written , " @entity77 told @entity84 during a recent hearing			0
not every @entity5 executive played by the books			1
@entity11 was once chairman of a brokerage firm called @entity103			1
in the early to mid- ' 90s , he called himself the @entity104			1
he was jailed on federal charges of securities fraud and money laundering			0
he spent 22 months behind bars and was released in 2005			0
" i was a crook , " @entity11 said			1
at one time , he says , he was earning more than $ 1 million a week			1
now , he has been ordered to pay back $ 110 million to his victims , and he said he is working on that			1
even the man who first chronicled @entity5 excess to a national audience can barely believe what has happened			1
@entity115 , who wrote and directed the film " @entity5 " 21 years ago , says the main character in his story , unprincipled stockbroker @entity119 , has been overtaken by reality			2
" i never thought it would go to this level , " @entity115 told @entity1 's @entity122			0
" i thought the @entity124 of the world would die out			0
" so what exactly did the new @entity124 do to earn those fabulous sums ? " what they really did was to figure out new and clever ways of investing , " @entity57 said			0
" of creating financial products that very few of us could understand			0
" " on @entity5 , there 's no cost			2
the only cost is the employees , the executives , " said @entity135 , managing editor of @entity136			1
" so if a firm is creating a financial product that it can sell for $ 5 million , the person who sells it will get $ 2 million			2
" but people who earned relatively little on @entity5 are now paying the price as well			1
@entity146 , a 25 - year - old @entity147 who worked at both @entity148 and @entity149 , is now out of a job			0
he 's launched a web site called @entity152 to talk about it			0
" my life was basically a disaster , " @entity146 said			0
" i was working all the time , did n't have a lot to show for it			0
i came to the conclusion that there was more to life than money			0
" while it lasted , the good times on @entity5 made money for traders and , of course , for @entity164 who had invested in the stock market , mainly through their 401 ( k ) contributions			2
but there is a " new normal " these days			0
" the party is over on @entity5 -- until it comes back again , " @entity135 said			1
" i 've been around long enough to see that we have these cycles			0
these guys get their cigars and champagne			0
they have a great time			0
the whole thing blows up			0
but then they re-emerge years later			0
this one is a really , really bad one			0
but i do n't think @entity5 is dead			2

@entity5 elite earned enormous amounts of cash , author says
@entity11 , known as @entity104 , said he was a crook
congressional researchers : @entity78 ceo earned nearly $ 500 million
" the party is over " for now , according to @entity136 managing editor
