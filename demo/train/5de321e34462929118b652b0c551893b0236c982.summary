the former world no. 1 came into the year 's first grand slam in good form after reaching the final of a warm - up event in @entity13 in @entity14 , but despite winning the first set against @entity17 's @entity16 , @entity4 slipped to a 2 - 6 6 - 4 6 - 4 defeat			1

" i think that 's a factor for any professional athlete , so i do n't think i 'm any different from anyone else , " @entity4 , who made 56 errors during the match , told reporters when asked if her health was the reason for her defeat			2

the biggest upset of the opening day saw sixth seed @entity55 slip to a 6 - 2 1 - 6 6 - 4 reverse against @entity59 's world no. 87 @entity60			1
it was @entity60 's first ever match with a top 10 player and her victory means she will at least equal her best grand slam performance to date -- reaching the second round in @entity66 last year			2
" i did n't play well , " conceded @entity55 , a @entity25 winner in 2011			0
" i did n't play my game that i really tried all off season to work on			0

organizers are reportedly preparing ice vests and ice towels to keep players cool , but @entity71 felt perfectly at home in the heat			0
" it was pretty hot out on court , " said the 29 - year - old @entity52			2
" you get that response from the court and balls when it 's hot and the sun is shining			0
" i was jumping and using my spin and all that whenever i was able to , so that was nice			0
" fourth seed @entity102 , beaten by @entity104 in last year 's final , admitted she knew nothing of her @entity108 opponent @entity107 before registering a comfortable 6 - 2 6 - 0 success			1
