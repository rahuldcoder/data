-- the likely failure of friday 's @entity3 conference to produce a credible political process to end @entity6 's civil war points up the painfully obvious : @entity6 -- a conflict seemingly without end -- is a moral , humanitarian and strategic tragedy			1
but it is neither an @entity12 tragedy nor the @entity15 administration 's fault nor responsibility			1
this does not mean the @entity12 is free to ignore the @entity6 conflict ; nor that its continuation does n't negatively affect @entity12 interests			1
what it does mean is that the president 's risk - averse policy -- containment , humanitarian assistance , helping to organize and supply certain rebel groups , and keeping open the possibility of a political track -- is absolutely right			0
the administration should continue to ignore its critics ' call for a more assertive policy , particularly if after a failed @entity3 conference , there are calls for military action			0
here 's why : we ca n't fix @entity6 with 130,000 - plus dead , thousands more wounded , a traumatized nation , and the social fabric of its society in shreds , @entity6 is beyond immediate repair or rescue			1
short of a major international military intervention , followed by a massive humanitarian and reconstruction effort in the billions and thousands of peacekeepers whose stay would be measured in years not months , the @entity6 conflict will go on			1
the notion that @entity12 can now intercede -- or at any point in the past three years , could have intervened -- in a way that would have stabilized the situation , let alone put @entity6 back together in some new form , is an illusion			1
with 140,000 @entity12 forces in @entity56 and @entity57 and trillions expended over a decade , we have not been able to fundamentally alter the politics of either nation in a way that promises security or good governance			0
in @entity65 , where the @entity12 supposedly had leverage from $ 1.3 billion in military assistance over its closest @entity69 partner , @entity64 has been unable to alter the course of @entity65 's politics and has become the object of antipathy by almost every faction in the country			2
these failures have little to do with @entity12 policy , and much more to do with the reality that @entity12 does n't control the world and can not dictate to societies composed of corporatist , religious and tribal elements who have their own interests and vision			2
to think we could dictate , let alone significantly influence @entity6 -- the poster child for sectarian and ethnic conflict and regional intervention -- is sheer folly			2
we ca n't even help the @entity6 fix @entity6 the notion that in 2011 , the @entity12 had a major opportunity to avoid the current situation , pre-empt the radicalization of the country through an infusion of jihadi groups , and unify a secular or moderate @entity98 opposition is also illusory			1
had the @entity15 administration been willing to supply a vetted opposition with sophisticated weaponry , including shoulder launched ground to air missiles , sophisticated anti-tank weaponry , and been willing to neutralize president @entity108 's air force through offensive no - fly zones , there would still have been no guarantees that a divisive and inchoate opposition could have remained unified and effective			2
even military strikes in the wake of @entity6 's use of chemical weapons would likely have had to have been followed by a sustained military campaign of some kind			0
and nobody in the administration , least of all @entity15 , was prepared to embark on such an open - ended military campaign ( for which the @entity12 people have shown no appetite )			2
at the end of the day , such an effort would still not have answered the question : who or what would have been able to hold the country together , stop the vendettas , police the borders and intervene to stop the inexorable struggle for control between @entity133 and @entity134 ? military intervention was always a trap the liberal interventionists and neoconservatives who have accused the administration of failing to lead never laid out an effective case as to what the relationship between @entity12 military action and the political end state in @entity6 would be			1
the @entity57 / @entity56 wars are a false analogy			0
nobody was talking @entity12 boots on the ground in @entity6			2
instead the correct analogy from the two longest and among the most profitless wars in @entity12 history was how precisely military action was going to achieve the objective of a stable , pluralist @entity6 in an @entity69 neighborhood in which there is not one example of such a state			2
president @entity15 was right to resist the use of force and will be right again , if in the wake of @entity3 's failure there is more talk of resorting to force			1
the horrific revelations of mass executions will only strengthen the arguments of those who see @entity12 military intervention as the only recourse			0
still , the last thing the @entity12 needs right now is a proxy war with @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 in a neighborhood where they have distinct advantages			1
@entity173 is the priority governing is about choosing			0
and the president clearly made a choice that preserving the possibility of a deal with @entity173 on the nuclear issue was much more important than involving the @entity12 in a war with @entity187 over @entity6 that @entity64 could never win			1
there 's no evidence to support this , but i have a strong suspicion that the decision not to respond to @entity6 's use of chemical weapons with military force was partly shaped by this calculation , particularly the possibility that @entity12 military action might have killed @entity173 forces in @entity6 , or to be sure increased not ameliorated tensions at a time the administration was already involved in secret talks with the mullahs who control @entity173			1
there is no foreign policy priority more important to the @entity15 administration right now than getting an agreement with @entity173 on the nuclear issue that would prevent an @entity212 military strike and make an @entity12 one unnecessary			1
the conventional wisdom is that a proxy war with @entity173 in @entity6 would have weakened the mullahs			1
but it could easily have led to the opposite reaction -- increasing @entity173 's sense of encirclement and an acceleration of its nuclear program			1
amoral but not immoral @entity6 is n't @entity222 or the @entity223			0
but it is an arena where mass killings and war crimes by the regime in particular , but also by its opponents , take place routinely			0
the @entity15 administration , particularly secretary of state @entity232 , feels deeply about this			0
but not so deeply that it 's prepared to intervene			0
that reluctance to intervene militarily reflects a policy that is n't immoral			0
@entity12 has been more active than any other nation in providing humanitarian assistance and helping organize the @entity6 opposition			2
if any kind of sustainable local ceasefires emerge from the @entity3 process , the @entity12 will have done much to better a horrible situation			2
but it is an amoral approach where moral considerations do not dictate			0
that is to say what drives @entity12 policy in the main is n't moral or ethical ; instead it is shaped by a variety of other factors , including the public 's opposition to military intervention , the president 's own priorities for his legacy ( the middle class , not the @entity251 ) @entity173 and a general sense that the last thing this country needs is another major foreign policy failure or obligation			1
as a result , the administration has rightly pursued a course that is risk - averse , not risk - ready ; one that understands that it can not act alone and that even multilateral action will only have limited results , and above all , one that recognizes that there are no solutions to @entity6 right now , only outcomes			0
it 's certainly not a morally or emotionally satisfying course of action			0
but it is the right one			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity282 .			0

@entity284 : even if @entity3 talks fail , @entity12 should n't intervene in @entity6 conflict
@entity6 is a tragedy but @entity15 has followed the right course , @entity282 says
he says president has rightly concluded that @entity12 ca n't resolve the conflict
@entity282 : preventing a war over @entity173 's nuclear program is a *higher* priority for @entity12
