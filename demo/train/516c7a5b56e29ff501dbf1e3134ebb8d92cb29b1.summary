before sitting down with " @entity2 mom " @entity3 , i was fairly certain there was nothing i would find redeeming about her or her new book , " @entity8 , " with its message that women should spend 75 % of their time in college looking for a man			1
after all , her letter to the " @entity16 " last year , which went viral , outraged many women , myself included , with its message that a woman should find a husband on campus before she graduates			1
what ? have n't we come a long way , baby , from the days when a woman 's only focus was marriage and motherhood ? after my hourlong conversation and polite give and take with @entity30 , a 59 - year - old human resources consultant and executive coach , i found myself still not agreeing with much of what she thinks but understanding the reasoning behind her efforts to get the conversation going			1
i remember seeing a magazine piece shortly after i graduated college in the late 1980s that pictured a 40 - something business woman with a title something along the lines of " i forgot to have kids			1
" dating checklists : practical or nitpicky ? that image , and the harsh reality at that time for many highly successful professional women , stayed with me for years			1
i continued my career as a fairly hard - driving news reporter , but in the back of my mind , i knew that i wanted children and did n't want to wake up one day regretting that i never made motherhood a priority			2
in a small but highly controversial way , @entity30 may be doing something similar for young women in college who want to get married and have kids someday			1
" honey , keep this in mind			0
you can not wait forever to get married and have children , " she tells them , citing declining fertility rates for women in their 30s			2
while i understand @entity30 's desire to have young women feel more comfortable admitting whether they want motherhood in addition to ( or in the absence of ) a career , i wondered if her delivery , and her words , are doing more to set modern women back			1
single woman seeking part - time lover ? @entity30 , who is divorced and whose sons followed her to @entity2 ( one is still an undergraduate ) , did n't mince words during our conversation			1
an edited version of our talk is below : @entity89 : do you consider yourself a feminist ? @entity30 : of course , i am fully supportive of equal rights and equal opportunity for women , and i recognize that i am one of the earliest beneficiaries of the good works of the women 's movement			1
... however , feminism has taken a turn to the dark side			0
they 've become bullying of women who aspire to traditional roles , women who want anything for themselves different from what the feminists , the very strident feminists ' doctrine , is directing them towards			1
@entity89 : forget the feminist label			0
many modern women like myself believe in empowering women to make the choices they want to make , and that many women would choose a career and marriage and motherhood , too			2
are people without kids happier ? @entity30 : in my experience , i certainly agree that modern women today do want marriage and motherhood			1
the problem is they 're afraid to say so because of the vitriol , because of this antagonist feminist doctrine that would have them believe that marriage and motherhood is somehow not cool			0
... it 's so retro			0
@entity89 : i do n't know if people would say it 's so retro			0
... you want to be empowered to have the career choices you want to have as well as be a mother and be in a relationship if you want marriage and family , too			0
@entity30 : if you delay starting a family and finding a husband until your mid- 30s , a few things happen			1
one , from the perspective of your fertility , you 're out of luck or maybe you 're out of luck			0
... the other component of this , so you 're 35 , who are you going to be looking at to marry ? i 'm going to say most women who are 35 are going to be looking for a man around the same age , or maybe a year or two older			1
so let 's take the man of 36			2
he 's quite happy to actually be with a woman 10 years younger			0
@entity89 : you say women should spend 75 % of their time in college looking for a man versus 25 % on their career			1
how is that not setting women back professionally in terms of their future careers that you admit are important ? @entity30 : i do n't think it hurts them at all because you can make up lost time at work			1
work a little harder , it 's ok			0
you can make up that lost time if you are focused on your personal happiness , which i guarantee you will outlast your professional happiness			2
your career is going to come to an end eventually			0
@entity89 : had i married any of my boyfriends in college , i 'd be divorced			2
@entity30 : i 've heard this argument before , that in your early 20s , you do n't know who you are going to evolve into by the time you 're 30			1
if you wait until you 're 30 to get married , you do n't know who you are going to evolve into by the time that you 're 40 , but i can guarantee you it 'll be somebody very different than you were when you were 30			2
... i think the smartest thing that a young woman or a young man can do is find a life partner who shares your values , who shares your love of learning , who shares your intellectual curiosity , who will applaud you , who will encourage you , and who you can grow with and evolve with through the decades			1
@entity89 : i 'm lucky			0
i got married at 36			0
@entity30 : right under the wire			1
@entity89 : you talk about " @entity203 " and spending more time in college to find that right person , but you have to believe it 's also very important for women , at the same time , to be fulfilled and find what they want because their marriage could end ; 50 % of marriages end in divorce			1
@entity30 : i 'm saying by all means develop your career , develop your professional self because that 's critically important			1
... women have to know that they are responsible for their own safety			2
they 're responsible for their own happiness			0
i am not saying a man is going to make you happy			2
i 'm not saying that a marriage will make you happy			0
i hope it does , but do n't expect that			0
do n't expect to only be happy because of your marriage			0
happiness comes from within clearly , and obviously nobody knows better than a divorced person how happy a marriage can make you ( or ) not			0
@entity89 : i cracked up when i read what you wrote : " be aware of marrying a dumb guy for good sex			1
the sex wo n't improve , and he 'll never get smarter			2
" @entity30 : there are two barnyard analogies that i cite regularly			1
the first is men will not buy the cow if the milk is free , and that 's the truth			0
if you give men sex without commitment , you have eliminated the incentive for them to commit			2
... an equally important barnyard analogy has to do with just what you 're talking about : the bad guys , the crazy boys , just the men you know you should n't spend time with			1
i 'm telling women avoid wasting time with the pigs for the sake of a little sausage			1
@entity89 : ca n't stop laughing			0
@entity30 : it 's absolutely true			1
i understand that women have needs , but not with that			2
@entity89 : you basically say if you require major ( cosmetic ) bodywork , get it done in high school			0
we want to encourage our girls to love themselves			0
the last thing we want to do is push them to have plastic surgery			0
@entity30 : i would never have plastic surgery , and i would n't recommend it for anybody except if you have a tragic flaw , something that enters the room before you do such that you are hounded by it , such that it so impacts your self - image			1
@entity89 : how do your sons feel about your newfound celebrity and your views ? @entity30 : there 's not a thing that i 've said that they have n't heard me say for decades			1
they are delighted that i found another platform by which to share my views with a broader audience , and they are absolutely delighted that i am having so much fun doing it			0
@entity89 : you have to have a pretty thick skin , i think , to put yourself out there with a very controversial position and not feel the blowback			0
@entity30 : it does n't bother me at all because i am so completely confident in what i 'm saying			2
... there was nothing in this for me other than my absolute conviction that this is a message that our young women need because all they 're hearing is you have to focus on work , work , work			2
@entity89 : do you feel misunderstood by many women who are criticizing you and who say you are setting women back ? @entity30 : well , they clearly have n't read what i 've written			1
they 've controverted what i 've said for their own purposes , or they 're so caught up in trying to look politically correct that they 've gone in a different direction from where i 'm writing			0
i 'm not criticizing anybody			0
i 'm not suggesting that you not pursue a career			0
i 'm just saying if you know this is what you want , plan for it because it does n't just happen			0
@entity89 : many people think you are evil			0
@entity30 : i 'm not the one that 's evil			2
i 'm trying to encourage a conversation			2
i 'm trying to bring to the fore a dialogue that 's been suppressed			0
it 's the feminists that are looking to continue to suppress the conversation			1
what do you think of @entity30 's argument that women who want to get married should look for a husband in college ? @entity347 in below in the comments or tell @entity349 on @entity350 or @entity351 on @entity352 .			1

@entity3 , aka " @entity3 , " is out with a new book , " @entity8 "
@entity30 : women who want to marry should spend 75 % of time in college looking for a partner
women should also never marry a dumb man even if the sex is great , the 59 - year - old says
@entity30 says feminists are trying to " suppress " the conversation around waiting too long to marry
