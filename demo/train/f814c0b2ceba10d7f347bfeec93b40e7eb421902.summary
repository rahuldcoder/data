nearly 800,000 @entity0 have done something @entity3 's 1.3 billion people can only dream of : cast a ballot to demand a democratic government			1
in an unofficial referendum organized by pro-democracy activists and denounced by @entity3 authorities , 787,767 people in the city of more than seven million have called for the right to directly elect their next leader			1
but @entity13 has insisted @entity15 politics stays in line with @entity3 rule , paving the way for a showdown in the city			1
who are the activists ? @entity23 is a pro-democracy group founded in 2013			0
their goal is to allow the @entity15 public to elect its next leader without strings attached			0
if the @entity15 government does n't eventually give the public more voting rights , @entity23 has threatened to " occupy " @entity30 , the city 's financial hub , with a sit - in that would disrupt businesses and block traffic			1
how is @entity15 governed now ? @entity15 is a @entity36 , with its own executive , legislature , and judiciary			0
a former @entity41 colony , the city was returned to @entity3 control in 1997			1
but before the handover , @entity3 and the @entity41 signed an agreement giving @entity15 a " high degree of autonomy " for 50 years after its return to @entity3			1
this enshrined a principle known as " one country , two systems " in a constitutional document called the @entity54			2
a few weeks ago , the @entity3 government released a strongly - worded white paper that said @entity15 does not have " full autonomy " and asserted that ultimate power over the city lay with @entity13			1
but many pro-democracy activists in @entity15 see this as a violation of " one country , two systems			0
" currently , @entity15 's leader , known as the chief executive , is elected by a small committee			0
in 2012 , this committee selected @entity67 , a staunch @entity13 choice , who remains in power today			0
what 's the referendum all about ? the @entity15 government has promised residents they will be able to vote for their own leader by 2017 , but here 's the catch : @entity13 says it will only allow candidates who " love @entity3			1
" @entity23 responded by organizing an unofficial city - wide referendum , which asked people to choose between three ways to reform @entity15 's voting system			1
all three plans proposed that candidates be nominated publicly , regardless of whether the candidates have @entity13 's blessing			2
to put it simply , anyone who voted in the referendum essentially said they wanted to have their own say in @entity15 's political future			1
what were the results ? the 10 - day voting period began june 20 and asked voters to choose between one of three proposals to reform the city 's election process			1
organizers had expected only 100,000 votes for what was originally just a two - day voting period			0
the final tally of valid ballots cast came to 787,767 , with 42 % going towards a proposal from the @entity106 that said candidates for @entity15 's chief executive should be nominated by the public , and conditions such as requiring candidates to " love @entity3 , love @entity15 " should not be allowed			1
activists say the large overall turnout is a clear indicator of @entity15 's discontent with @entity3 government policies			1
" whatever @entity13 may say in public now i think it can hardly afford to ignore the voices of 780,000 @entity15 people , " @entity117 , former chief secretary of @entity15 told @entity118			2

@entity3 's @entity126 declared the unofficial referendum to be " unlawful			1
" in an editorial published june 23 , the state - run @entity128 called it an " illegal farce			2
" the next day , another editorial accused activists of sowing " hatred			0
" @entity15 's @entity13 - backed chief executive has said none of the proposals being voted are legal			2
however , he has also said that none of the voters will face criminal consequences			0
meanwhile , @entity3 's censorship machine has been active on the issue			1
internet searches for " @entity23 " were completely blocked within mainland @entity3 , while searches for @entity15 - related topics were among the most heavily censored , according to @entity3 social media visualizer @entity147			2
as voting went underway , newscast signals from @entity15 were also reportedly blacked out in @entity3 's neighboring @entity152 province , where @entity3 residents normally enjoy access to @entity155			1
organizers of the referendum also claim their website has been hit by significant cyberattacks , though it is unclear where the attacks may have originated from			0
what about the sit - in ? if the @entity15 government does n't reform its electoral system in line with what @entity23 is asking for , the group says it will marshal 10,000 people to sit and peacefully block traffic in downtown @entity15 as a way to pressure @entity13 into allowing @entity15 to exercise " genuine universal suffrage			0
" given @entity13 's uncompromising response to the referendum so far , it seems @entity23 's activities are increasingly likely to occur			0
but nobody knows how much disruption the protest may cause			0
@entity15 's security chief has warned the protest could turn violent , and " things could get out of control			0
" others have warned that @entity23 could disrupt @entity15 's typically stable economy			0
what else is going on ? it 's been a month of political activism in the city			0
a 25th anniversary vigil for the 1989 @entity192 crackdown victims drew around 100,000 people , and the subsequent release of @entity13 's white paper only riled up the city 's politically - minded residents even further			2
on july 1 , @entity0 will stage an annual pro-democracy protest march			2
the turnout is expected to be huge			0
we could be seeing tens , if not hundreds of thousands of people			0
later , @entity23 reportedly plans to organize a follow - up referendum , which will give voters a choice between the most popular reform solution , and the government 's proposal			1
