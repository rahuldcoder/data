-- what 's happening in @entity2 ? supporters of opposition leader @entity4 attend a rally in @entity6 on monday			1
@entity7 resigned as @entity2 's president after weeks of bitter and deadly political clashes			1
the military handed power to @entity4 , the 34 - year - old former mayor of @entity6			1
@entity4 and @entity7 have been engaged in a bitter power struggle since the beginning of the year			1
despite vowing that he would never give up power without an election or referendum , @entity7 fled his presidential palace			2
the army later stormed the abandoned palace as a show of support for @entity4			1
analysts believe that @entity7 had little choice but to step down once he lost the army 's support			0
the power grab ended a chaotic few days in the island nation			1
though @entity4 's supporters say he is now in charge , the dust has not yet settled			1
is this a coup , as the @entity32 has suggested , or is this a popular expression of the people ? why did this happen ? trouble has been brewing in @entity2 since january , when @entity7 sacked @entity4 from his post in the capital			1
@entity4 , a former @entity39 and media entrepreneur , tapped into rising frustration in the country over high food prices and service delivery to rally support against the president			1
he set up a parallel government and led massive street protests against his rival			0
over 100 people were killed in the protests , culminating in a demonstration outside the presidential palace in february when a further 23 were killed			2
reports suggest most were killed by the security forces			0
while @entity4 has tapped into popular discontent , @entity2 watchers say that to call this a popular revolution over simplifies the takeover			1
" i think at first @entity7 was quite popular with the people but he treated the political elite with disdain , " said historian @entity60			0
this made him enemies within the country			0
@entity7 v. @entity4 -- are they that different ? @entity7 made his fortune in business and has interests in several media outlets			1
he came to the fore politically in 1999 when he was appointed mayor of @entity6			0
@entity4 gained prominence as a @entity39 and also has interests in several media businesses			2
he too gained political traction by becoming the mayor of @entity6			0
both men gained popular support by reaching out to the masses as a leader for the youth of @entity2			1
@entity7 was first elected president in 2001 and won a second term in 2006			0
to many @entity2 he represented a new breed of politician - a self - made millionaire , a no - nonsense business leader			1
but @entity7 maintained his business empire while in office and it was unclear to many where his business interests ended and his political leadership began			0
@entity4 tapped into the very same strategies of slick marketing and a youthful appeal that @entity7 had depended on			2
some feel he is just a younger version of the former president			0
will the international community recognize the new government ? it is unlikely that key members of the international community will rush to support @entity4 's push into power			1
" all of the parties to this conflict need to exercise restraint and resume dialogue , " said @entity108 , @entity110 state dept. spokesman , " i also want to make clear that any extra constitutional resolution will result in a cut - off of @entity110 assistance			0
" prior to the takeover , the @entity32 warned that any power transfer aided by the military would amount to a coup d ' état			2
the @entity32 has since diluted its rhetoric - removing any mention of a coup in its official communiqué on the takeover and calling for the protagonists to " comply scrupulously with the provisions of the @entity128 on interim arrangements			0
" the crisis in @entity2 is a test for the @entity32			1
despite purporting to be champion of democracy , recent power grabs in @entity135 and @entity136 and the botched elections in @entity138 and @entity139 , have tested the continental groups claims			0
why should you care about @entity2 ? @entity2 is n't just a cartoon movie			2
it is the fourth largest island on the planet with a population of around 20 million , a rich cultural history and breathtaking natural diversity			0
in the relative stability of the last 8 years , the country 's tourism sector has boomed , bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars			0
however most ordinary @entity2 have not seen any trickle down from the tourism industry			2
the country remains one of the poorest in the world .			0
