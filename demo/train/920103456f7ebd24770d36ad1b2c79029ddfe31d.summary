@entity0 -- a @entity3 court has found that the @entity4 violated an international treaty and the court 's own order when a @entity9 national was executed last year in a @entity11 prison			1
@entity12 was executed by lethal injection for raping and murdering two girls aged 14 and 16			1
the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) issued a ruling monday in an unusual case that pitted president @entity18 against his home state in a dispute over federal authority , local sovereignty and foreign treaties			2
@entity9 had filed a formal complaint against @entity4 state and federal officials " @entity4 has breached the obligation incumbent upon it " to stop the execution , the @entity15 announced in a unanimous opinion			1
@entity12 's death by lethal injection in august followed a 15 - year legal dispute after his conviction for two brutal slayings			1
at issue was whether @entity11 and other states had to give in to a demand by the president that the prisoner be allowed new hearings and resentencing			2
@entity18 made that request reluctantly after the international court in 2004 concluded that @entity44 and about 50 other @entity9 on various states ' death rows were improperly denied access to their consulate upon arrest , a violation of a treaty signed by the @entity4 decades ago			2
their home countries could have provided legal and other assistance to the men had they been notified , the court said			0
in a separate judgment , the @entity15 declined @entity9 's demand that the @entity4 provide guarantees against executing other foreign inmates in the future			1
the @entity4 @entity61 last march ruled for @entity11 , allowing the @entity44 execution to proceed			1
efforts stalled in @entity64 last summer over legislation that would have given foreign death row inmates like @entity44 a new hearing before any punishment could be carried out			2
@entity70 officials have said the international ruling will not help other foreign inmates in @entity4 prisons , because federal officials can not force states to comply			1
administration officials also said that the president did all he could to force state compliance and that @entity64 now needs to intervene with specific legislation			0
@entity12 was 18 when he participated in the june 1993 gang rape and murder of two @entity83 girls : @entity84 , 14 , and @entity85 , 16			0
he was convicted of the crimes and sentenced to death			0
the prisoner 's lawyers argued that @entity9 consular officials were never able to meet with the man until after his conviction			0
only @entity94 has commuted a capital inmate 's sentence to life in prison in response to the international judgment			0
days after @entity12 died by lethal injection , @entity11 executed @entity104 native @entity102 , who also said his treaty rights were violated			1
the @entity15 in 2004 ordered the @entity4 to provide " review and reconsideration " of the sentences and convictions of the @entity9 prisoners			0
that world court again in july mandated that the @entity4 do everything within its federal authority to stop @entity12 's execution until his case could be further reviewed by @entity4 courts			1
based in @entity118 , @entity119 , the @entity15 resolves disputes between nations over treaty obligations			0
the 15 - judge panel is the principal judicial organization of the @entity3 , laying out rights of people detained in other nations			0
the @entity61 appeal turned on what role each branch of government plays to give force to international treaty obligations			0
after the @entity15 ruling , the @entity4 pulled out of that international court 's jurisdiction in matters arising from the @entity137			2
in allowing the @entity44 execution to proceed , the @entity61 majority noted congressional " inaction " on the issue , efforts that had " not progressed beyond the bare introduction of a bill in the four years since the @entity15 ruling			1

@entity70 says ruling wo *n't* aid other foreign inmates
