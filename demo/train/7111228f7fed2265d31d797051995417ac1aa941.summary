@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 administration needs an air traffic controller to manage its domestic policy agenda			0
the items are starting to pile up on the runway			0
move over , health care			1
it was n't exactly a graceful transition			0
in fact , at first , it looked like bad timing that tens of thousands of protesters descended on @entity17 to demand comprehensive immigration reform on the same day that @entity19 was voting on a bill that overhauled the health care system			1
you had to wonder : what if more than 100,000 people marched on @entity17 , and no one noticed ? actually , even with everything else going on that day , plenty of people noticed the return on the national agenda of one of the most emotional and contentious issues in @entity33			0
immigration reform advocates have their eye on the calendar			1
in october , rep. @entity37 , @entity38 , a major proponent of comprehensive immigration reform , said during an interview on @entity40 that the immigration debate would have to be reopened by march in order to get a bill passed before the november midterm elections			1
ironically , the fact that the debates over health care and immigration overlapped actually worked out well for the proponents of immigration reform			1
it gave members of the @entity53 additional leverage to pressure president @entity4 into declaring his support for a comprehensive immigration reform bill that is about to be introduced by sens. @entity56 , @entity58 - @entity57 , and @entity59 , @entity61 - @entity60			1
the president needed a push			0
liberals are loath to admit it , but @entity4 has been asleep at the switch when it comes to keeping his campaign promise to pursue immigration reform			1
and it is n't just -- as his defenders say -- because he was preoccupied with the economy and health care			1
the truth is , @entity4 never connected with the immigration issue with the same degree of passion with which he connected with other issues like health care reform , education reform , even climate change			1
if the protesters had n't gone to @entity17 and forced his hand , @entity4 would have simply gone on to education or the economy and put immigration reform on the back burner			1
now , thanks to the march , and other rallies planned around the country in april , @entity4 has gotten the message that immigration reform wo n't wait any longer			1
it certainly wo n't wait until after the november election , as sen. @entity95 , @entity96 , has suggested			1
@entity95 is obviously trying to be a good @entity97 , trying to spare his colleagues and his party any more legislative drama			0
but he 's not looking out for the best interests of the immigration reform movement			2
he must suspect @entity103 are likely to make huge gains in november , especially after the health care vote			2
the time to act is now			0
the legislative puzzle will only get more complicated when a new @entity19 is seated			2
some liberals want the immigration reform movement to be patient			2
there is nothing new there			0
some on the left said the same thing during the civil rights movement			0
in this case , those who want to reform the immigration system have been waiting patiently since september 2001 , when president @entity119 first suggested comprehensive immigration reform			1
and the longer they wait , the more complicated things get			0
the inaction remains the same			0
the only thing that changes is the narrative			0
first they 're told that @entity19 ca n't fix a system that both sides acknowledge is broken in good economic times because there are too many immigrants here and those kinds of population swings only exacerbate the anxiety that many @entity33 feel about changing demographics			1
then the economy goes sour , and they 're told @entity19 ca n't act now because unemployment is too high and @entity33 have developed a new anxiety -- over their own economic instability			1
reformers figured out in a hurry that they were being played and that @entity19 never intended to deal with this issue			2
it 's just too hard			0
just like health care reform was too hard ? personally , i believe @entity147 made a colossal mistake by approving a radical upheaval of the nation 's health care system and then compounded that error with all the shenanigans involved			1
nonetheless , i have to admit that it was impressive to see a group of lawmakers in either party work up the passion and courage to disregard the polls and actually do what they thought was right in the face of taunts , slurs , voter contempt and thousands of e-mails and phone calls from angry constituents			2
sadly , that kind of leadership is something you do n't see much in an institution like @entity19 , which is usually too risk - averse for its own good			2
whether the issue is gay marriage on the left or fixing @entity180 on the right , moral courage is scarce on the @entity182			2
recently , there was a rare sighting			0
there needs to be another			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188			0

as @entity19 voted on health care , tens of thousands marched for immigration reform
@entity188 says @entity147 showed moral courage in health care bill push
he says immigration is a cause that ca n't wait
he says system is broken and @entity19 should act now , not wait for better economy
