all the elements were there for low turnout : it was a beautiful , cloudless night , the @entity4 - @entity4 game had just ended , and the state 's critical place in presidential politics still felt years away for most @entity8			1
but on saturday night in @entity10 , @entity11 , roughly 130 people showed up to see independent sen. @entity12 of @entity13 talk about elevating the middle class , nationalizing health care and fighting the degrading influence of money in politics			1
and they did n't just listen -- they urged him to run for president in 2016			2
" we need a political revolution in this country , " @entity12 said , to applause			1
" politics is terribly important , and what happens in @entity27 and state capitals is also enormously important			0
" a largely older , markedly liberal audience listened to @entity12 for over an hour inside the student center of the local university			1
before the event started , attendees chatted about the senator coming to @entity10 and whether he was going to run for president			1
many said they hoped so , mostly because they want a liberal option in the @entity39 primary in 2016			2
" everything he says speaks to me about who i am as an @entity46 , as a voter , as a middle - class voter , " said @entity40 , who sat in the front row at the event			0
@entity12 did not actually mention his presidential aspirations from the dais , but his event in @entity11 -- along with town halls in @entity55 and @entity56 on sunday -- made it clear that he is toying with a bid			1
the final steak fry : honoring @entity60 with a large helping of politics @entity12 told @entity63 earlier last week that he was thinking about a run and was traveling to @entity11 to " find out what kind of support there is for a progressive agenda			1
" he wo n't say whether he would run as an @entity69 or a @entity70 , but his supporters in @entity11 clearly wanted him to run as a @entity70			1
@entity12 was not the only potential 2016 candidate in @entity11 this weekend			1
@entity73 , the prohibitive front - runner for the nomination if she chooses to run , is headlining the @entity76 in @entity56 on sunday			1
it is her first event in the @entity11 in over six years			1
@entity80 's and @entity12 ' events could n't be more different			1
the former secretary of state will speak to more than 5,000 people at an idyllic field south of @entity56			0
signs adorn every corner of the event , which will see over 2,500 pounds of steak grilled and served			0
the only signage for @entity12 ' event was a small piece of cardboard in front of the building that read " @entity12			2
" but @entity12 is benefiting from @entity80			2
people at his event liked the fact he was courting @entity4 despite @entity80 's front - runner status and was willing to stand up and possibly challenge her from the left			0
" i think the @entity39 party needs to move a little bit to the liberal , progressive side , " said @entity100 , who organized @entity102 's 2008 @entity4 campaign			0
" i want to hear him			0
of course i like him , i know his history			0
" before his speech , @entity12 reflected on the third beheading of a @entity110 individual by @entity111 and president @entity113 's authorization of military strikes in @entity115			2
" clearly @entity111 is a terrorist organization , a brutal organization , a dangerous organization , " @entity12 told @entity63 , before he quickly turned to a topic he is more comfortable about : the middle class and the economy			2
" in the midst of dealing with @entity111 , it is absolutely imperative that we not ignore the huge problems facing the middle class and working families of this country			0
" the senator did devote a great deal of his speech to speaking about the future of the @entity46 , including outlining a plan he called the " @entity131			0
" his first point was the most well - received : " we have got to restore the democracy to the @entity46 by overturning this disastrous @entity136 @entity135 decision			0
... i do not believe that people fought and died for democracy so that billionaires can buy elections			0
" @entity12 has become a champion of overturning the @entity143 ruling , which opened the floodgates for outside money in politics and ballooned the amount spent on campaigns			2
he spent the last week arguing as much from the @entity150 floor			0
on health care , @entity12 added that " the @entity46 needs to join with the rest of the industrialized world and have a nationalized health care			2
" @entity12 ended his speech with a call to action , urging attendees to begin a conversation and organize support in northeast @entity11 for the issues he was addressing			1
" our job is to educate , is to organize , is to go outside our zone of comfort , " he said			0
" we need to build coalitions			0
" @entity80 tops democrats in @entity11 while @entity167 leads republicans @entity12 challenges @entity73			1

sen. @entity12 is on a three - stop tour of @entity11 , which *raises* presidential questions
in @entity10 , @entity12 calls for " a political revolution " and asks supporters to organize
@entity12 is in @entity11 at the same time as @entity73 , the 2016 *favorite*
