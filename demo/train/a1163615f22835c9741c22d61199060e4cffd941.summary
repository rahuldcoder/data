@entity0 , @entity1 -- jurors in the trial of self - help guru and speaker @entity6 , accused of three counts of manslaughter in a 2009 @entity1 sweat lodge ceremony , heard a recording wednesday in which he previewed the intense ceremony and told participants how it would be a " death and rebirth experience			1
" before the october 2009 ceremony at a retreat center near @entity20 , @entity6 told participants it would include the most " intense heat you 've every experienced in your life			1
you will feel like you are going to die			0
" the author described the ceremony as a sacred way for participants to rid themselves of " all the things that you 've allowed to be your truth and have caused you to sell yourself short			2

" the participants would then enjoy a celebratory dinner and share personal breakthroughs in an evening session			0
but something went horribly wrong			0
three people died during or after the purification ceremony and @entity6 was charged in their deaths			1
the defense told jurors in opening statements last week the three died in a " tragic accident -- not a crime			2
" prosecutors maintain @entity6 psychologically pressured participants to remain in the lodge even when they were n't feeling well , contributing to their deaths			1
in the recording , @entity6 told participant , who paid up to $ 10,000 each to attend the event , that as " true spiritual warriors " and their " altered state " they would endure heat so intense it would make it feel like their skins was coming off of their bodies			1
" i will be right there with you , " he said			0
" you will have to get to a point where you surrender to death , " @entity6 said			1
" when you are going into the lodge symbolically you are going back into the womb of mother earth			2
" " it is such a great metaphor ... " the author said			0
" my body dies but i never die			0
" prosecutors argue that the lodge -- made of willow trees and branches , and covered with tarpaulins and blankets -- was heated to perilously high temperatures , causing the participants to suffer dehydration and heatstroke			2
during his recorded talk , @entity6 repeatedly told participants to drink plenty of fluids			1
but @entity88 testified he had not much to drink in the previous 36 hours and had only a short time to hydrate			0
and the real estate salesman from @entity91 said no physical examination or medical information was required before the event			0
another participant , @entity96 , told jurors she saw no preparations by @entity6 's staff for any medical emergencies			1
@entity6 told participants that if conditions became unbearable , they could leave when the lodge flap was opened			1
he promised a transcending experience			0
" you will be in such an altered state , " @entity6 said			1
" you may see visions			0
it 's a great opportunity to explore your own consciousness			0
" @entity96 , a gynecologist from @entity110 , @entity111 , and a participant in the program , testified she was concerned that a man who had been burned on his hand inside the lodge was allowed back in			1
@entity6 said a nurse would assist the participant , she testified			1
but @entity96 also said she did not perceive participants in the lodge 's dark interior needed medical attention			2
if they had , she would have provided assistance , the doctor told jurors			2
@entity96 said she would not have entered the lodge if she thought there was a possibility she might die			2
@entity96 testified that @entity6 never stopped anyone from leaving the sweat lodge			1
she acknowledged under cross-examination that water and fortified drinks were available to participants			0
earlier , @entity136 , who served as a volunteer at the 2009 event near @entity20 , took the stand for the fourth day wednesday to talk about how she and other " @entity141 " members tried to help ceremony participants			2
under cross-examination , @entity136 acknowledged that , in a police interview on the day of the ceremony , she suggested the deaths and injuries were an innocent accident and that perhaps something on rocks inside the lodge contributed to the injuries			2
the heat in the sweat lodge was maintained by heated rocks brought in by " firetenders " during regular intervals in the ceremony			1
@entity6 is charged with three counts of reckless manslaughter in connection with the october 2009 incident at the spiritual retreat			1
if convicted , he could face up to 10 years in prison on each count			0
@entity96 said she told detectives that they should look at carbon monoxide levels and dehydration among participants			0
@entity136 also said ceremony participants had been warned about how hot the lodge would be and that @entity6 never told anyone who left during the event they would have to return			1
the man who burned his hand voluntarily returned to the lodge			0
@entity178 , 38 , of @entity179 , @entity180 , and @entity181 , 40 , of @entity182 , died the night of the event			0
volunteer @entity183 , 49 , of @entity184 , @entity185 , died nine days after the ceremony			0
the so - called sweat lodge -- which was 5 feet tall and 23 feet wide , and built to accommodate up to 75 people -- was the site of a purification ritual for participants modeled on @entity193 customs			1
@entity6 encouraged participants to hydrate throughout the retreat and warned them the sweat lodge would be very hot , his attorney has said			1
participants signed a release form saying that the retreat activities could include a sweat lodge with enclosed spaces and high temperatures , @entity200 said in his opening statement last week			1
