-- the final game of one of the most memorable matches in @entity5 history , featuring two fan favorites , took on a life of its own			1
back in 2001 -- in the 16th game of the fifth set -- members of @entity12 's entourage asked for divine intervention as the @entity14 sought to close out the encounter against @entity17 's @entity16 and end years of @entity5 heartache			1
@entity12 himself asked for help from above , he wanted the same ball when serving , and @entity17 and @entity14 spectators on @entity23 roared encouragement between points to make for a football like atmosphere			2
@entity12 had lost three previous @entity5 finals and seemed destined to miss out on glory at the @entity30 given he had struggled with a shoulder injury earlier in 2001 and contemplated retirement			1
his ranking of 125th was n't even high enough to land direct entry into the tournament			1
@entity5 gave @entity12 a wildcard , however , and he proceeded to work his way through the draw with a little help from @entity5 's famed and all too frequent rain gods			1
so there he was against @entity16 on " people 's monday , " leading 8 - 7 in the fifth set , four points from winning the most prestigious tennis tournament in the world			1
no ordinary player -- and character -- one sensed that if @entity12 held serve , he would do it the hard way			2
he had to overcome a resilient @entity16 -- and painful memories of defeats to @entity53 , twice , and @entity54			2
it proved to be the case			0
a forehand volley went long by a large margin for 0 - 15			0
at 15 - all , he double faulted			0
having hit an ace to get to championship point , he subsequently double faulted again -- by a yard			0
a second championship point came and went with another double fault , this time into the net , and a third was saved by @entity16 with a lob that was good enough against an @entity12 too frozen to jump			1
@entity16 finally buckled on a fourth match point , the pressure from @entity12 's destructive serve finally too much to repel			1
a return sailed into the net and @entity12 was the @entity5 champion and the only wildcard to bag the men 's title at noted postcode @entity74			1
dedication to a fallen friend he worked his way into his players ' box and exchanged hugs with his team , which included father @entity82 , who had recently undergone a triple heart bypass			0
@entity12 dedicated the victory to former @entity86 star @entity85 , who died in a car accident in 1993			2
" the best moment is when you hold the trophy , " @entity12 told @entity0 's @entity88 before the start of @entity5			1
this year 's men 's final will be played on sunday			2
" i was watching too many guys holding that beautiful trophy			0
i had this ( runner - up ) plate at home , " added @entity12			2
" it 's a nice plate but you do n't want to have that plate at home			2
" nobody cares for second place			0
if you want to go back now and think of @entity5 finalists in the past 15 years , to be honest , i have no idea			1
" @entity12 almost did n't get that far			1
he trailed @entity112 's @entity111 two sets to one in the semifinals , losing the third 6 - 0 in about 15 minutes			2
he was out of sorts			0
that 's when the unpredictable @entity112 weather saved @entity12 and hurt the local darling			1
with @entity111 holding a 2 - 1 advantage in the fourth set on the second friday of the fortnight , rain fell and the contest was suspended			0
they returned saturday and @entity12 , mentally fresher , claimed the fourth set in a tiebreak			2
a further suspension ensured the nervy affair had to be completed sunday , with @entity12 eliminating @entity111 6 - 3 in the fifth to disappoint a nation			2
a monday final beckoned against @entity16 , himself a loser to @entity53 -- the king of @entity5 prior to @entity134 's arrival -- in the 2000 finale			1
fans queued up overnight to land one of the 10,000 unreserved tickets made available for the final , leading to a more vocal climax than usual			0
" it was good that it was on a monday because three finals i lost on sunday , so finally i played on monday , " @entity12 said			1
" unbelievable atmosphere , probably never again because now they have a roof			0
" @entity16 is a very good friend , a great guy			2
we both should have won @entity5 before , him in 2000 in the final , and i was supposed to win a long time ago			1
" after @entity12 beat @entity149 in the second round he sensed something special was about to happen			1
did it the hard way besides @entity111 and @entity16 , @entity12 also topped @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 in a difficult draw			1
of his seven victims , only one -- first - round opponent @entity158 -- would never feature in the top four in the rankings			0
" it was an unsolved mystery how i won , but i felt after the second round that i was going to win , " @entity12 said			1
" i could not say it loud because they would think i was completely nuts			0
" i felt for the first time after so many months , actually a year , the racket ( that i played with had a special sound )			0
i lost the sound for a year and a half and that ( first ) monday i got the sound back			0
i said , ' this is a good sign			0
' " the sound had vanished when @entity12 began the year by playing in qualifying at the @entity170			2
stuck on a back court after playing in some of the world 's grandest stadiums , he tanked -- a tennis term for not trying			0
although unpleasant at the time , it proved to be that year 's turning point for @entity12			1
" i had a long journey to think about what i was going to do , then i went to play a challenger in @entity180 , " @entity12 said			0
" i played the final			0
then i started to play better			0
i did n't have great results but i started to enjoy it again			0
" @entity5 came and it was actually my time , " added @entity12 , who can still be seen on the seniors ' tour , while he also helps run a tournament in @entity187 and dabbles in commentating			1
" it was written somewhere that it was my time			0
i did everything in my life the harder way			0
why do it easy if you can do it the hard way ? " but by doing it the hard way , the larger - than - life @entity12 has ensured his achievement at @entity5 will never be forgotten .			1

twelve years after his @entity5 triumph , @entity12 is n't sure how he won
@entity12 needed a wildcard to enter the tournament because his ranking was n't high enough
@entity12 beat @entity16 in a ' people 's monday ' final after losing three other finals
@entity12 , hampered by a shoulder injury , contemplated *quitting* tennis before his title
