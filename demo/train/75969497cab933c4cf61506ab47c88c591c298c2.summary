-- " but i do n't want to join @entity2 , " my friend @entity3 says , fighting off my entreaties to start tweeting so we can stay in touch throughout the day			1
" i already feel like i spend too much time online			0
do n't you feel like it just distracts you from actually connecting with people ? " @entity3 had a point			1
i 'd been on @entity2 for over a year , but it was only in the past few months that i 'd gotten into it as a daily part of my routine			1
and while i loved its chattiness , i was mostly chatting with people i barely knew			2
a normal human being might have solved the problem by spending less time on @entity2 and more time on the phone			1
but many of my closest friends are on the @entity23 or in @entity24 , so by the time i get my kids in bed , it 's too late to call			2
that 's how i fell into tweeting : it lets me have a ( pseudo ) social life during the hours of the day when i 'm actually available to chat			2
but that was no reason to connect with casual acquaintances more than dear friends			1
inspired by my conversation with @entity3 , i sorted my @entity2 buddies so that the people i loved most were in a special group			1
then i set up my @entity2 client to give special prominence to the updates from people i love -- or people i could love if we had more contact			1
overnight , @entity2 stopped being a way to keep up with colleagues and became a way of keeping in touch with friends			1
@entity0 : could @entity2 help you lose weight ? whether your online interactions happen on @entity56 , @entity2 or some other platform , you can bring the same quality of intention to your online relationships			1
online conversation can be a great boon to your friendships , but only if you organize your online socializing around the kinds of relationships -- and that specific people -- that matter to you			2
go where your friends are as soon as i reorganized @entity2 to focus my attention on my most valued relationships , i noticed how many of my dearest pals were n't on @entity2 at all : they were on @entity56			1
in my enthusiasm for the shiny novelty of @entity2 , i 'd forgotten all about @entity56 -- but went back to checking @entity56 regularly when i realized that 's where my closest pals hung out			1
you would n't hang out at the latest trendy bar if your friends were still gathering at the neighborhood pub ; do n't get caught up in the race to join the latest hip network if it takes you away from the online communities that engage your dearest friends			1
@entity0 : how one woman 's finding miracles on @entity56 prioritize your bff before i had kids , i spent hours on the phone every week and stayed in regular contact with half a dozen good friends			2
but the after - work hours that i used to spend yakking with my girlfriends are now filled with feeding , bathing and reading to my kids ; i 'm lucky if i can find an hour a week to talk with a friend			0
that 's enough time to talk with each of my close friends once every three months -- or to talk with one good friend every 10 days			2
focusing my phone time on my oldest and dearest friend means that when we talk , we can actually have a meaningful conversation about the latest chapter in our lives , rather than using an hour to catch up on news highlights			0
social networks can make staying in touch a lot easier , but they ca n't actually cram more hours into the day			1
if you focus your online and phone time on a couple of close friendships , you 'll have more meaningful conversations than you can sustain with a large circle			0
do n't confuse " friends " with friends " you know @entity122 , do n't you ? " a colleague asked			1
the name was familiar , but i could n't place it			0
" you 're friends on @entity56 , " my husband reminded me			0
make that " friends , " not friends			0
the fastest way to erode your commitment to the relationships that matter to you is to confuse that long list of buddies you have on @entity56 , @entity2 or @entity133 with actual people you know and love			1
@entity0 : a newcomer 's guide to @entity56 take the move test a year after our daughter was born , my husband and i interviewed for a number of jobs in another city			0
as we contemplated moving towns , we found ourselves pulling back from our extended circle of friends			0
we decided to turn this instinctive withdrawal into a conscious choice and stopped making plans with anyone we did n't expect to stay in touch with after moving			0
ironically , this contributed to our decision to stay put : once we focused our time and attention on the people we saw as lifelong friends , our social life became much more meaningful and satisfying			1
whether you move every year or plan on living in one place your whole life , an imaginary move is a great way of focusing your email , chat and @entity56 time on the people who you love most			2
balance your social life we were at a local restaurant for dinner with our closest couple friends , enjoying a rare evening of adult conversation while the kids stayed home			2
as we compared notes on our jobs , kids and sex lives ( like i said , close friends ) , i found myself looking wistfully at the table next to hours , where four women made up a " @entity186 " quartet huddled in an intimate conversation			0
how long had it been since i went out with a gang of women myself ? friendship is n't one thing			0
even if you have satisfying one - on - one visits with your bff , or a few great couples with whom you and your sweetie socialize , you may be missing group friendships			0
or you may have friends who are great for a wild night out but miss that trusted confidante			2
know the balance of friendship types and friendship time that makes you happy , and you 'll be better able to create that social life by cultivating current or new relationships online			0
accept compromise it 's saturday night , and as my husband and i banter across @entity2 , we 're joined online by friends who weigh in on our latest debate and tease us for our geekiness			1
if we had found a sitter , we 'd be at a party across town , but once again we 're confined to quarters , where socializing via @entity2 serves as the next best thing			2
for those times when you know what kind of social life you want , but budget , time or logistics make it impossible , the @entity216 can be a great pinch hitter			1
maybe your ideal night out is a hockey game and a trip to a bar -- but you know you 'll still have to wake up at 6 with your toddler			0
watch the game at home on hd while you commiserate over that rotten play via chat or @entity238 " !			0
maybe you 'd like to spend more time with your bff , but your husband finds her husband dead boring			0
invite them over for a night of @entity246 gaming , and let the guys play @entity248 while you and your pal catch up			0
if these tips sound like they 're more about emotional intelligence than tech know - how , you 're catching on			1
the secret to a satisfying social life online does n't lie in which network you join or how cool your profile page looks -- it 's about using social networks to reflect and amplify the way you connect with your friends			1
and as your bff can already tell you , you 've got that down cold			0
