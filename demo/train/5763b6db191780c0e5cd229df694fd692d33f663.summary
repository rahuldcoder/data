three @entity2 navy ships have begun searching the @entity3 for traces of missing @entity5 , but have yet to find anything , a commander said friday			1
the ships are operating off a tip from an @entity10 company that claims to have found possible traces of an underwater airplane wreck in the area			1
" we have n't found anything yet , and the frigates will continue the search until they verify all available information , " commodore @entity14 , director of @entity2 navy intelligence , told @entity16 on friday			1
although @entity10 officials and other experts have derided the claim , acting @entity23 transportation minister @entity22 said he , too , is considering sending a ship to search -- even though he thinks it is " highly unlikely " the plane will be found in the @entity3			1
@entity22 said the tip could be confirmed only by sending vessels to the area , which is thousands of kilometers away from the official search area in the southern @entity35			1
" but i just want to stress that by doing that , we are distracting ourselves from the main search , " he said friday			2
" and in the event that the result from the search is negative , who is going to be responsible for that loss of time ? " his comments came three days after the @entity10 company @entity46 publicized its claim that it may have found the wreckage of a plane in the bay			1

but no debris from the plane has been found			1
the search is entering a new phase , @entity22 said friday			0

@entity179 , the @entity180 partner of flight 370 passenger @entity181 , said she was one of about 500 people at the @entity107 meeting thursday			0
she said @entity106 relatives had told her they dreaded the day that the hotel centers would close , fearing they would n't get timely updates at their rural homes			2
" they are very distraught , because the average @entity106 family member will be sent home to mostly a very rural place with limited access to ( the ) @entity192 , " she said			0
" they just feel like all lines of communications will be cut			0
" but some family members do n't mind leaving the hotel			0
" nothing has changed for me , because living in @entity107 and living back home is the same to me , " said @entity109 , a relative of one of the passengers			0
" we will move on to the next stage , and we will still keep on fighting for the truth and where the plane is and where our loved one is			0
