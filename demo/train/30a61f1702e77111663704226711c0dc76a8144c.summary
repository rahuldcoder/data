@entity0 -- in a late - night vote after a bitterly partisan debate , the @entity2 passed a $ 694 million border bill friday , but the measure has no chance of becoming law			1
the vote was almost entirely on party lines , 223 - 189 , with just one @entity11 , @entity13 rep. @entity12 , voting for it			1
four republicans opposed the legislation			1
the bill proposes to give the @entity18 more than $ 400 million for additional border security and law enforcement measures			2
it would allocate more than $ 20 million to speed up the deportation process by accelerating the judicial process , and also would set aside millions for @entity25 border efforts and temporary housing for unaccompanied minors , among other things			2
the measure that passed friday also included a change to a 2008 anti-trafficking law to make it easier to send home the unaccompanied children from @entity36 countries			0
the @entity38 - led @entity37 had already left @entity0 to start a five - week summer recess after it was unable to pass its own legislation to give president @entity41 some of the money he 's requested to address the massive influx of migrants at the nation 's southwestern border			1
at a news conference friday , president @entity41 dismissed the @entity2 @entity15 measure as " a message bill " and vowed to veto if it came across his desk			0
the vote came one day after a chaotic scene on @entity54 when @entity2 speaker @entity55 was forced to abruptly pull an earlier version of the bill because it did n't have sufficient votes to pass			1
some conservatives did n't like the price tag of the legislation and others demanded tougher restrictions on a separate bill that would halt future deportations of some child immigrants who arrived years ago			1
@entity2 @entity15 leaders had already agreed to hold a separate vote on that measure , modeled on a plan from conservative sen. @entity71 , @entity72 , which would prevent @entity41 from continuing his @entity74 ( @entity74 ) policy			1
under @entity74 , the administration can defer deportations of children brought to the @entity79 illegally by their parents			0
but conservatives wanted to end that policy , fearing that the president would use his executive authority to expand deportation deferments			0
after a late night of negotiations on thursday , @entity15 leaders agreed to the demand			0
the @entity2 passed that bill friday , 216 - 192 , after a heated and ugly floor debate			1
@entity91 accused the @entity15 of being " anti-hispanic " and " extreme " -- a message the party will certainly repeat over and over before the midterm elections			1
brushing off accusations that both bills were just political theater , @entity2 @entity15 worked all day to lock down the votes from their members			0
they believed passing legislation right before they left for the break would flip the narrative -- instead of being the party that did nothing , they could claim they stayed and approved a plan while the @entity91 who run the @entity37 left town without any action on the issue			1
" the people 's @entity2 is here working and we 're not going to stop working until we pass legislation that actually addresses this crisis , " said rep. @entity110 , @entity111			1
@entity2 @entity91 said the @entity15 would only make the situation worse			0
rep. @entity117 , @entity118 , warned that the @entity120 ' legislation would cause the deportation of 600,000 " dreamers " -- people who arrived in the @entity79 illegally as minors and received conditional permanent residency under the 2001 @entity126			2
" republicans want to kill @entity74 and kill it quietly on a friday night , " @entity117 said			2
but rep. @entity128 , @entity129 , said the president 's move " to use his pen and cell phone to legislate " and allow children stay in the country violated the @entity136 because it was up to @entity138 to pass new laws			0
republicans criticized @entity41 for sending mixed messages to @entity138 on modifying that law			2
the president and some in his administration indicated they could support a bill to expedite deportations of children coming from @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 , but then backed off after congressional democrats strongly opposed linking that with additional border money			2
without any agreement on additional resources to address the border crisis , @entity41 said friday , " we 've run out of money			0
" three weeks ago , @entity41 had asked @entity138 for $ 3.7 billion in emergency funds to help process the unaccompanied children at the border and boost border security			0
the @entity91 ' plan called for $ 2.7 billion , but it failed to advance			0
the president said friday he would reallocate money to ensure federal agencies providing housing or holding immigration hearings could continue to handle the increased activity along the border in @entity13			1
@entity169 plunges into immigration debate crisis impacts public opinion @entity1 's @entity173 contributed to this report .			0
