-- welcome to bug season , when mosquitoes , ticks and other creepy crawlers make even the bravest mom or dad hesitant to let the kids go outside			2
not only are insects annoying , they can carry diseases such as @entity10 virus and @entity11			0
but what 's the best way to ward off these pests ? a new report , released wednesday by the @entity16 , finds that no one bug repellent works against every insect , but your best bets are those products made with active ingredients registered with the @entity24 @entity23 and approved by the @entity25			1
scientific tests have shown that four registered chemicals provide a high level of protection from a number of bug bites , according to the @entity16 report : @entity33 , @entity34 , oil of lemon eucalyptus ( and its synthetic derivative known as @entity38 , or @entity38 ) and @entity39			1
these chemicals are found in many of the popular products on your drugstore shelves			1
despite @entity39 's reputation as a harmful substance , the @entity16 researchers found it to be one of the most effective chemicals against the risks of @entity10 virus and @entity11			1
" we found them all to be safe , especially if people do n't overdose on the product , " said @entity53 , lead author on the study and a researcher with @entity16			2
" and these chemicals do protect people against a lot of rather nasty insects			2
" and that 's important because insect - borne illnesses are on the rise			1
the @entity10 virus , which is carried by mosquitoes , infected more than 5,600 @entity24 last year , and 286 people died from the virus , according to the @entity25			1
a report this week in the @entity70 noted that the virus , which had been declining over the past few years , spiked in 2012 , especially in @entity72			0
by analyzing the epidemic in @entity75 , @entity72 , researchers found serious @entity10 outbreaks begin early , after unusually warm winters			2
they also seem to be concentrated in one area every year			0
the virus migrates around the country , so health officials say it 's very important to be aware if your area is being affected			0
incidences of the tick - borne illness have more than doubled over the last 15 years , according to the @entity25			1
although the disease is transferred to humans through the bite of a deer tick , that tick is only found in 13 @entity93 states from @entity94 to @entity95 , and in the upper @entity96 , mostly in @entity97 and @entity98			2
if you live in those states , it 's best to take precautions			0
" you need to know the insects that exist where you live and what works best against them , " @entity53 said			0
" no need to spray repellents for , let 's say , ticks , if they 're not prevalent in your area			0
" although these four chemical repellents are effective , they need to be used correctly , the @entity16 warns			2
consumers must follow the basic instructions to make sure that they do n't overexpose their skin			0
for instance @entity39 , when used correctly , is an excellent repellent , but overuse has been found to cause neurological problems in some people			1
health experts suggest sticking with a 30 % concentration , a number that can be found on the repellent 's label			1
researchers say anything more concentrated is n't necessary unless you are working outside for a long period of time			0
" the concentration level does n't mean how much it protects , " @entity53 said			0
" it means how long it protects			0
so if you are out for a few hours , 30 % is just fine			0
" the @entity16 also notes that repellents should be a last resort when warding off insects			0
the organization recommends covering up with clothing , like long pants and long sleeves , socks and shoes			1
and be aware of the environment around you			0
draining standing water -- where mosquitoes breed -- from your yard will keep populations low			1
" we realize during the summer people are n't going to be wearing heavy clothing , or worrying about bugs as they enjoy the outdoors , " @entity53 said			1
" so that 's why we made this list			0
these products are out there , they are safe , and people should be using them to protect themselves			0
" @entity33 developed by @entity156 in the 1980s , @entity33 is not known to irritate skin and eyes and does not have a bad odor			1
it may also repel bugs for longer periods of time than other chemicals			1
products that have @entity33 : @entity166 ; cutter ; @entity168 ! active ; @entity168 ! @entity170 ; @entity171 and @entity172 @entity34 @entity34 has been used in @entity173 for years			1
it can be irritating to the eyes but poses few other safety risks			0
@entity177 , the manufacturer , recommends formulas with 10 % to 30 % concentration to repel biting insects and ticks			2
products that have @entity34 : @entity183 @entity39 approved for public use since 1957 , @entity39 is the most common mosquito and tick repellent			1
products that have deet : bug off ; @entity189 ; @entity168 ! active ; @entity168 ! @entity170 ; @entity168 ! @entity191 ; repel ; @entity192 oil of @entity194 / @entity38 oil of lemon eucalyptus is the trade name for a repellent that originated as an extract of the eucalyptus tree , which is native to @entity201			1
because the dangers to children have not been thoroughly investigated , products with oil of lemon eucalyptus or @entity38 have warning labels that say , " do n't use on children under the age of 3			2
" most oil of lemon eucalyptus products are sold under the name repel or @entity213 .			0

four chemicals provide protection from biting bugs : @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity38 , @entity39
despite *negative* reputation , @entity39 was found to be most effective and least toxic
insect - borne illnesses are on the rise in the @entity24 , experts say
covering up with clothing and draining standing water will also help prevent bites
