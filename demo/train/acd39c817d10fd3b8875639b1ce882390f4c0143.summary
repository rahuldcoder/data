-- @entity1 has hit the headlines , but this obscure , impoverished southern @entity4 republic on the coast of the @entity6 wo n't be familiar even to those who pride themselves on being news nerds			1
were it not for the fact that @entity15 and @entity16 , the two brothers implicated in the deadly @entity14 , lived briefly in @entity1 before coming to the @entity10 , and had @entity15 , the elder sibling , not visited there last year , most @entity10 would have been blissfully ignorant about this patch of the planet			1
but @entity1 has a special resonance to the people of the @entity22 , especially to @entity23 , the largest religious group in the republic			1
the legendary @entity26 , who led the war against the @entity4 @entity29 's armies between 1834 - 1859 as they sought to conquer the area , belonged to @entity1 's @entity32 ethnic group			1
@entity33 : @entity35 suspect says brother was mastermind more recently , the august 1999 incursion into @entity1 by militants based in neighboring @entity39 was among the triggers of contemporary @entity4 's second war there			1
@entity4 military installations in @entity1 were attacked in 1996 , 1999 , and 2002			1
the @entity4 authorities linked the 2010 suicide bombings of the @entity45 to a @entity47 militant leader , and the two female suicide bombers hailed from @entity1			2
yet none of this explains why @entity1 is suddenly so prominent in international news headlines			2
what has made this little known place famous now is its connection to the @entity56 , ethnic @entity52 raised in the @entity58 republic of @entity59 -- particularly elder brother @entity15 , who spent time in the poor @entity4 republic in early 2012			1
his recent turn to @entity64 and interest in radical @entity67 websites has now raised question about what , if anything , connects the @entity35 bombings to distant @entity1			1
@entity1 is one of seven small republics within the @entity4 that together comprise @entity4 's @entity22 region , a predominantly @entity23 area which itself is wedged between the @entity6 and @entity76			1
@entity1 adjoins @entity39 , lies at the eastern extremity of the @entity22 mountain range , and the @entity47 capital , @entity80 , sits on the @entity6 coast			2
smaller than @entity82 and with under 3 million people , @entity1 is an ethno - linguistic kaleidoscope of some 30 nationalities , among the largest being the @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , and @entity89			2
aside from the poverty of most of its inhabitants , several features mark @entity1 's recent history , few of them positive			2
though @entity39 , in late 1991 , was the first @entity22 republic to try to secede from @entity4 , an anti-russian insurgency now covers the entire @entity22			1
it has metamorphosed from a primarily nationalist , secular revolt into one driven by @entity98 , whose goal is not just freedom from @entity4 but the creation of a sharia - governed " emirate " encompassing the entire region			2
@entity39 , ruled by the brutal , @entity4 - backed strongman @entity104 , is now relatively quiet , and its @entity67 insurgents , while still active , are on the defensive			1
but @entity1 has gone in the opposite direction and is gripped by instability and violence			2
radical @entity67 groups tied to the war against the @entity4 state now have much deeper roots , and are far more active , in @entity1 than in @entity39			1
drive - by shootings , kidnappings , bombings , and slayings of local politicians and law enforcement personnel are commonplace			0
much of this upheaval can be traced back to militant @entity67 groups , but it also stems from organized crime and turf battles , often waged along ethnic lines , to control sectors of the @entity47 economy and smuggling routes			1
corruption is pervasive , as is the brutality of the security services			0
life in @entity1 , in a few words , can be chaotic and violent , and if you are in the wrong place at the wrong time , short			1
as for poverty , very few @entity137 can escape it			0
timeline : a look at @entity141 's past this , then , is the setting @entity141 visited recently and where he spent a short time as a teenager			1
but it 's unlikely that @entity1 is where he acquired the worldview that allegedly turned him into a terrorist or where he allegedly received the training to build the bombs that killed and maimed @entity152			0
it 's clear by now that @entity15 felt estranged from @entity10 society and had become a devout muslim before he returned to @entity1			0
indeed , he felt happy hearing the calls to prayer from @entity80 's mosques because @entity64 had already become integral to his identity and outlook			0
unfortunately , he seems to have been animated by variants of @entity64 espoused by extremists , not the @entity64 of the @entity22			0
did @entity15 associate with militant groups during his @entity47 sojourn ? we do n't know yet			0
but it 's unlikely that he would have received sustained training from professional terrorists while he was there			0
the bombs allegedly made by the @entity141 brothers , while deadly , were primitive			0
the duo made no attempt to disguise themselves : @entity177 's friends reportedly spotted him in crime photos in which he wore his trademark baseball cap turned backward			0
the bombers killed an @entity182 police officer and carjacked a @entity183 , not exactly an inconspicuous vehicle , while a massive manhunt for them was underway			0
murderous as the plot the brothers allegedly designed was , professional it was notâ € ” and that 's fortunate			0
many more people would have perished had @entity35 been targeted by a well - established international terrorist group connected to @entity192			0
there certainly is a violent @entity195 insurgency underway in @entity1 and much of the rest of the @entity22 , but the militants ' main adversaries lie within @entity4			1
@entity10 is peripheral to their pursuits			0
@entity1 has its fair share of problems , but the answers to why the @entity56 may have turned to terrorism will likely have much less to do with the republic than the changes they , especially @entity15 , underwent in @entity10			2
the opinions expressed in this piece are solely those of @entity210 .			0
