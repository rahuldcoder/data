@entity0 -- in the latest salvo of a pitched political battle over @entity6 targeting , the top @entity2 on the @entity3 said tuesday that interviews with 15 tax agency employees found no evidence of bias or @entity12 manipulation alleged by @entity13			1
" despite an extremely aggressive investigation involving thousands of documents and more than a dozen interviews of @entity6 employees , the overwhelming evidence before the committee reveals no political motivation or @entity12 involvement in this process , " said the memo made public by rep. @entity15 of @entity16 , the panel 's ranking @entity2			1
the committee chaired by @entity28 rep. @entity28 of @entity29 will hold another hearing on the @entity6 targeting on thursday , continuing a probe that has bitterly divided its two party leaders			1
@entity15 accuses @entity28 of conducting a partisan witch hunt and making false accusations about the scandal first uncovered in may by an inspector general 's report that detailed how the @entity6 targeted conservative groups seeking tax - exempt status for extra scrutiny			1
@entity28 and other republicans have claimed the targeting amounted to a campaign by president @entity44 's @entity12 to go after political foes , with some comparing it to the @entity35 that forced president @entity47 from office			1
@entity49 have pushed back , led by @entity15			0
last week , he revealed new documents indicating the @entity6 subjected both liberal and conservative organizations to additional tax scrutiny in recent years			1
dems highlight @entity6 targeting of other groups the memo @entity56 made public tuesday was written by the committee 's @entity49 staff			2
it contained excerpts of interviews with 15 @entity6 employees from the committee 's investigation of the targeting cited by the inspector general 's report			2
in the excerpts , the employees who identified themselves as @entity13 , @entity49 and independents said there was no political motivation or outside influence involved in the agency 's handling of tax - exempt requests from groups with possible or likely political affiliations			2
under tax law and @entity6 regulations , groups that primarily engage in political activity are ineligible for tax - exempt status			2
according to the @entity15 memo , an @entity6 tax law specialist based in @entity0 who described herself as @entity13 said " no , not at all " when asked if there was any evidence that the agency targeted @entity44 's political enemies			1
" that 's kind of laughable that people think that , " the memo quoted the woman as saying			0
she described the situation as a lack of guidance regarding how to deal with politically affiliated groups seeking tax - exempt status at the @entity6 unit based in @entity102 that handles such applications			0
thursday 's hearing promises to be a fiery showdown between @entity15 and @entity28 over the initial inspector general 's report and the subsequent findings and accusations by both sides			0
according to the @entity12 website , the inspector general for tax administration , who wrote the report on @entity6 targeting , will be a witness along with past and present @entity6 employees in the tax - exempt division			2
@entity15 demanded last week the inspector general , @entity118 , be called to appear again before the committee to answer questions about why his original report failed to note that liberal groups also were targeted for extra scrutiny			1
the @entity6 probe " has been characterized by one - sided and partial information leading to unsubstantiated accusations with no basis in fact , " @entity15 said			0
@entity118 's report in may indicated that lax oversight at the @entity6 allowed for the singling out of some conservative groups starting in 2010 and continuing until last year			1
in particular , the report said @entity6 workers in the tax - exempt unit used " @entity136 " or bolo lists of words such as tea party to assess what applicants came under extra scrutiny			0
@entity118 subsequently testified that he could not specifically identify whether any liberal groups were similarly targeted			2
however , @entity15 said the information made public last week showed that @entity118 was aware that liberal groups also were targeted			1
conservative group takes @entity6 , top @entity44 officials to court in addition , @entity15 revealed a may 2013 e-mail from @entity118 's deputy that noted how 5,500 internal @entity6 e-mails were reviewed as part of an effort to discover any directing of staff to target " @entity156 and other political organizations , " as well as any subsequent coverup			1
" there was a ' @entity160 ' ( @entity162 ) list specifically naming these groups , " the deputy inspector general 's e-mail notes			0
" however , the e-mails indicated the organizations needed to be pulled because the @entity6 employees were not sure how to process them , not because they wanted to stall or hinder the application			0
" the deputy 's e-mail goes on to stress that " there was no indication that pulling these selected applications was politically motivated			0
" in response to the documents @entity15 made public last week , @entity28 's office said conservative groups underwent tighter scrutiny than liberal groups			1
" these documents , once again , refute misleading attempts to equate routine scrutiny of other groups involved in advocacy to the systematic scrutiny of @entity156 groups by @entity6 officials , " spokesman @entity182 told @entity1			0
" as has been documented , while 100 % of @entity156 applications were systematically stopped and scrutinized for a 27 - month period , at the same time dozens of progressive applications were approved by the @entity6 , " @entity182 said			0
' angry ' @entity44 announces @entity6 leader 's ouster @entity1 's @entity194 contributed to this report .			0

a bitterly divided @entity197 holds another hearing this week on the @entity6 scandal
the panel 's top @entity2 says no evidence so far backs @entity13 claims of political targeting
@entity13 @entity6 employee : claiming @entity12 enemies were targeted is " laughable "
conservative groups faced more scrutiny than liberal groups , @entity13 rep. @entity28 says
