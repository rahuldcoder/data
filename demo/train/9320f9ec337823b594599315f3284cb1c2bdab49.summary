@entity1 appeared on " @entity3 " on tuesday with a story so awkward , it made @entity5 hide under his desk			2
it turns out that @entity1 and @entity8 had met once before years ago but have n't seen one another since			1
as these things go , the two of them have totally different memories about what happened during their meeting : @entity1 thought she was going to " hang " with the star , but @entity8 was totally oblivious			1
" i do n't know if you remember this , but we met before , " @entity8 told @entity1			1
" oh , i remember , " @entity1 replied			2
" yeah , you tell your version ( of the story )			0
" @entity8 remembers walking around @entity22 when he got a call from a friend named @entity26 , who tells him that @entity1 wants to meet him			1
" maybe to be in ' @entity27 ' or something like that , " @entity8 recalls			2
but according to @entity1 , their meeting had nothing to do with a movie			2
" i just remember that i liked you , " she tells a bewildered @entity8			2
" @entity26 , our mutual friend , says , ' oh , @entity5 wants to meet you , and you can go over to his apartment			0
... ' and i 'm single , and i 'm like , ' ok , yeah , cool			0
' " apparently , @entity8 had no idea that this was supposed to be a romantic setup			2
" what ? did i date @entity1 ? ! " @entity8 asked			1
if he did , he did n't do it well			0
@entity1 made her way to @entity8 's apartment , only to find the comedian in " a baseball cap and , like , nothing			1
" " you would n't talk , " @entity1 went on			0
" and then you put on a video game or something , and i was like , ' this is so bad			0
' " at that point in @entity1 's story , @entity8 fled for cover under his desk			1
but @entity1 was n't done : " after about an hour and a half , i thought , ' he has no interest			0
and then i left and ( thought ) , ' ok , no chemistry			0
maybe he 's gay ? ' " she said with a laugh			0
@entity8 swears he had " no clue at all " that he could 've dated @entity1 , but as the @entity68 actress says , it just was n't meant to be			1
@entity1 went on to marry country star @entity69 in 2006 , and @entity8 wed movie producer @entity70 in 2007			1
both stars now have kids			0
" i ca n't believe i dated @entity1 ! " @entity8 said			1
" this is one of the most awkward moments ever			0

@entity1 *revealed* that she and @entity8 had met before
they *'d* been on a date of sorts , set up by a friend
@entity8 was completely embarrassed by @entity1 's memory
