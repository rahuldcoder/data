-- it was a homecoming rally to cheer on the @entity3 football team			2
they were undefeated this year			2
then , in the midst of the cheers and a sea of red and white pom poms came a 30 - second skit that , for some , turned an afternoon of school pride into one of shame			1
three white male students involved in the skit made light of domestic violence , and they did it in racist manner , say some			1
two were in blackface as they re-enacted a 2009 domestic abuse incident in which singer @entity22 assaulted then - girlfriend @entity23			2
the student who played @entity22 was vying for the school 's " mr. @entity33 " title -- a school tradition in which skits are performed and the one that garners the most applause wins the title			1
on monday , @entity33 alum @entity34 posted a photograph of the skit on @entity0 's @entity37			1
he says someone shared the image on @entity40			2
by tuesday afternoon , the @entity37 had more than 46,000 views and showed up on @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 and in local newspapers			1
suddenly , @entity47 became synonymous with racism and sexism			0
@entity50 lit up with comments about the skit			1
many were critical , but some defended the skit			1
" i do n't think it was offensive at all , " said @entity56 , who earned her high school diploma from @entity33 last year and moved to @entity59 but returned for homecoming last week and saw the skit			1
" there 's nothing wrong with blackface			1
there 's nothing wrong with dressing up as a black person			1
@entity67 is but a color , " @entity56 said			0
@entity70 superintendent @entity69 said tuesday that he did not believe the students in the skit intended to offend anyone			1
@entity33 resident @entity74 , a 2007 graduate of the high school , said he believed most of the kids were unaware of the historical context of blackface , a form of theatrical makeup used by white people in minstrel shows that perpetuated racist stereotypes of african - americans			1
@entity74 said the @entity23 incident had also been satirized online and on television before			0
" was this a little bit inappropriate ? yes , " he said			0
but said the incident " has been completely blown out of proportion			0
" other incidents of blackface have surfaced this year , including a @entity96 second - grader who offended a teacher when he painted his face black to resemble the rev. @entity99 the @entity101 skit was approved by school officials before it was performed , @entity69 said			1
he acknowledged the problem and said he was speaking with students , teachers and staff at the school in the coming days			1
" my concern is to start making something teachable out of this particular circumstance , " he said			0
the desire to win likely fuels outrageous behavior , said @entity114 , assistant director of @entity115 , an agency that aids victims of rape , domestic violence , assault and hate crimes			0
other skits at the pep rally involved @entity123 and a dairy farmer milking his cows			0
last year , a student played @entity127 , also in blackface			0
" i have heard about blackface , but ... they 're portraying @entity132 events , " alum @entity129 said			0
" it would be the same thing if he bought a mask			0
" bottom line , @entity129 said : people are being too sensitive			0
" they go crazy about every little thing , " he said			0
" the school and everybody are going to basically stop letting kids be kids			2
" @entity34 said he posted the image not to cast a harsh light on anyone but to prod the school to do better with issues of diversity			1
" i do n't believe the kids really knew what they were doing is as offensive as it is , " @entity34 said			1
" the administration was watching this go on , and they let it happen			0
" alum @entity154 also blamed school officials			2
he said @entity33 , a small town off @entity156 just west of @entity157 , @entity158 , could easily be seen as a place that affirmed stereotypes of all sorts			1
of @entity33 's 4,444 people , 4,312 were white , according to 2010 census data			2
@entity154 said he was " extraordinarily offended " by the skit and ashamed that his school seemed to be ok with it			1
" on the one hand , i ca n't blame the kids for being ignorant , " @entity154 said			2
" it 's a small town , and the kids do n't know any better			1
it 's the responsibility of the administration to let the kids know this is not how you behave in 21st - century @entity176			2
... they 've been failing at that spectacularly			0
" the administration should be creating an environment where minorities are welcome , not the butts of racist jokes that make light of domestic violence			0
" @entity154 contacted @entity47 principal @entity186 by e-mail			0
he sent @entity189 's response , which read in part : " thank you for your concerns			2
we will continue to address issues of diversity and respect for all			0
the format of pep rally will need to be reconsidered			0
i appreciate your concern for your alma mater			0
" @entity69 , for his part , said he could see how the skit could have been misconstrued and that he intends to set clearer expectations for behavior			2
" i have some opportunities here to make positive change , " he said			0
@entity0 was not able to obtain the names of the students involved in the skit			1
whatever their intentions were , one thing was clear : their portrayals of @entity22 and @entity23 fell short -- the kid who played the dairy farmer was crowned mr. @entity33			0
@entity0 's @entity220 contributed to this report .			1

some students at a @entity158 high school do n't see anything offensive
others are outraged that the school allowed such a skit to take place
the superintendent does n't believe the students were intentionally *malicious*
a photo of the skit posted on @entity0 's @entity37 went viral
