-- @entity1 , a 24 - year - old @entity2 from @entity3 , expertly twirled to the pulsing beats of a @entity6 tune during the talent portion of the @entity9 pageant			1
at the same time , she spun the traditional notion of @entity12 beauty on its head			1
in the interview portion of sunday 's pageant , @entity1 was asked about @entity18 - @entity12 journalist @entity17 's decision to have eyelid surgery to advance her career			1
" i do n't agree with plastic surgery ; however , i can understand that from a standpoint , " @entity1 said , delivering a noncommittal , diplomatic answer			1
" but more importantly , i 've always viewed a @entity9 as the girl next door , and the girl next door is evolving as the diversity in @entity12 evolves			1
she 's not who she was 10 years ago , and she 's not going to be the same come 10 years down the road			0
so i would n't want to change someone 's looks or appearance , but definitely be confident in who you are			0
" while @entity35 made the decision to undergo eyelid surgery , @entity1 opted to highlight her heritage on a historically conservative @entity12 platform			1
and both women reveal that each of their definitions of beauty , to varying degrees , is rooted in the idea of individual choice -- a concept that , for better or worse , is as @entity12 as it gets			1
half a century ago , @entity9 was synonymous with a blond - haired , blue - eyed incarnation of beauty			2
but the first @entity2 - @entity12 winner of @entity9 and @entity35 's candid admission reflect the evolution of @entity12 beauty , which is now less about assimilation than it is about the freedom of choice			1
it 's been more than 60 years since the @entity9 had @entity56 , a stipulation that barred nonwhites from participating : " @entity58 must be in good health and of the white race			2
" and gone is the day when it was required for contestants to list their ancestry			0
on the surface , this change suggests that culturally assimilating to white @entity67 ideals is no longer a prerequisite to winning			0
but @entity1 's win sparked criticism , including tired call - center analogies , references to terrorism and being dubbed " @entity75 " -- for supposedly prioritizing her subcontinental roots over her star - spangled ones			0
critics seemed to emphasize that her @entity2 heritage -- she was born in @entity3 to parents from the southern @entity2 state of @entity80 -- and @entity12 patriotism could not occupy the same space , no matter how genuine her display			2
former miss california : how do we teach kids diversity is beautiful ? @entity1 , an eloquent speaker and aspiring doctor , should be a welcome respite from a surge of recent pageant participants who have claimed headlines for all the wrong reasons			0
cases in point : blond - haired , hazel - eyed @entity96 hopeful @entity95 , who gained notoriety in 2007 for a largely incoherent response to a geography question , or @entity102 miss @entity100 2013 , aka @entity103 , of " create education better " fame			0
@entity35 also faced hurdles following her decision to have plastic surgery , including a family that was initially divided over her choice			1
" i did it ; i moved on			0
no one 's more proud of being @entity18 than i am , " @entity35 told the hosts of @entity115 ' " @entity114 " last week			0
" after i had that done , the ball did roll for me , " she added , referring to her new and improved journalism career			0
ultimately , whether it is @entity17 or @entity1 , miss @entity122 or miss @entity3 , i 'm grateful that they all set the stage for my own story : the daughter of @entity2 immigrants , born and raised in @entity131 and educated in the @entity12			1
it 's heartening to know that there are others who exist outside traditional conventions of @entity12 identity , paving the way for a more inclusive definition of both inner and outer beauty			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity143 .			2
