why return to a favorite story 25 years after it began ? for author @entity4 , the answer lies in one word : " joy			1
" in speaking with @entity7 , @entity4 used the word more than once to describe his experience with " @entity10 , " the comic book series that started in 1988 and achieved widespread acclaim , originally ending in 1996			1
the story was a revolutionary reboot of a superhero character from the 1970s			2
@entity4 was given free rein at the time to make him completely different and ran with it			1
now , @entity4 is back with the new series " @entity10 : @entity21 , " and the second issue is set for release on wednesday			1
@entity4 has since written many popular novels including " @entity24 , " " @entity25 , " " @entity26 , " coraline " and most recently , " @entity27			1
" but for many fans , " @entity10 " -- an oftentimes surreal story about the realm of dreams , which originally ran 75 issues -- remains his best known work			1
actor @entity34 is a fan , and he 's producing a possible " sandman " film			2
" @entity21 " is @entity4 's first new " @entity10 " story in 10 years ( 2003 saw his last " @entity10 " follow - up , the graphic novel " @entity39 " )			1
the " @entity10 " series primarily follows the character @entity42 , who appears with various names and forms and has control over the dreams of everyone and everything			1
@entity7 has an exclusive look at several pages of artwork from " @entity21 , " and @entity4 spoke to us about the return of some of his most popular characters , and why they 're back now			1
( @entity57 is owned by @entity7 's parent company , @entity58			0
) @entity7 : what made you resurrect " @entity10 ? " @entity4 : it was a combination of things			1
the joy of stopping " @entity10 " at the time was i did n't tell all the " sandman ' " stories i could ever tell			1
but i did finish the story i started in " ' @entity10 " no. 1			1
the joy was if i wanted to i could go back and do more			0
that was where ( 1999 's ) " sandman : dream hunters " came from			0
that was where ( 2003 's ) " sandman : endless nights " came from and now " @entity10 : @entity21			1
" it was the idea of going back and telling all these stories and all these things that i know and other people do n't know			0
so why do n't i tell them ? while that 's all true , the other thing that drove it was i originally wanted to tell this story back in 2008			1
it would have been " @entity10 's " 20th anniversary			1
for various reasons , @entity57 ( @entity57 ) could n't make it happen			0
so when ( @entity57 president ) @entity93 came in , she asked is there anything you want to do ? and i said i 'd really love to do the story for " @entity10 's " 25th anniversary			1
it seems huge and a great thing to mark			0
and she said , ' what a great idea ! " and we set out to do it			0
@entity7 : the art of " @entity10 " has always been extraordinary and otherworldly			1
what did you have in mind for this one ? @entity4 : we had an extremely short list			2
we had @entity111 , and we 're incredibly fortunate that he said yes			0
it 's probably the most beautiful art that i have ever seen in a periodical comic			2
whenever he does a page , he takes a photo			0
i look at the detail and the design			0
what he 's doing is unbelievable			0
it 's unlike anything i 've ever seen in a monthly comic			2
the scene at the end of the first issue of " @entity10 : @entity21 " where we see all the different @entity132 from across the universe , all the different versions of @entity42 meeting at once			1
that 's been in my head for 24 years			2
@entity7 : and when can we expect more ? @entity4 : july will be issue 3 and then probably some more months then issue 4 , issue 5 and issue 6			2
i 'm already missing it			0
the magic of ' @entity10 ' is going back and finding the characters ' voices are still alive and still real			2
@entity7 : what will the fans take away from " @entity21 ? " @entity4 : the lovely thing about this is i genuinely do n't know what the fans will respond to			1
there 's nothing you have to know to read the comic			2
there 's already things which i 've written so far in " @entity10 : @entity21 , " which when you go back and read the original comic , things will change			1
@entity7 : what makes you decide to write a comic book as opposed to a novel , when you have these different kinds of storytelling available to you ? @entity4 : mostly it 's " do i want to see this drawn ? " one of the most interesting things about " @entity10 : @entity21 " is i really , really wanted to see the pictures			1
the stuff in issue 3 is the nearest " @entity10 " has ever come to a spaghetti @entity172			2
it 's not like anything i 've ever done in any other way			0
when i 'm outlining a comic , i write down the numbers 1 to 24 , and i jot down what 's happening on each page , because i have to think of things in terms of pages , and double page spreads			2
in a novel , if i want to move a scene , i just cut and paste			0
in a novel , it 's a completely different conversation			0
@entity7 : is there still more " @entity10 " on the horizon ? @entity4 : can i tell " @entity10 " stories until i die ? the characters are still in my head ; they 're still there			1
but there 's so many more things i need to write before the long night comes , before i put the pen down for the last time			0
i really hope there 's more " sandman " in there			0
it would be sad if there was n't			0
but there 's so much more left to write			0
@entity7 : are there more stories you 'd like to revisit ? @entity4 : the next thing coming out is a little revisit of " @entity25 , " which came out many years ago			1
it 's a " @entity25 " short story called " how the @entity210 got his coat back , " coming as part of ( the anthology ) " @entity215 " in september , edited by @entity214			2
@entity7 : and is there a " @entity10 " movie in the works , as well as a tv series of " @entity26 ? " @entity4 : i think i 'm allowed to tell you that @entity34 signed on as a producer for the " @entity10 " film , and i had a fantastic day spent with @entity224 talking " @entity10 , " and his knowledge and commitment to it impressed the hell out of me			1
and " @entity26 , " wait and see			0
people are being talked to , exciting things are going on			0
@entity7 : what advice do you have for writers who have read your work and want to try their hand at it ? what pitfalls should be avoided ? @entity4 : the biggest pitfall to avoid is not writing			2
not writing is really , really easy to do , especially if you 're a young writer			0
the hope that elves will come in the night and finish it for you , is a very common one to have			0
that is my main recommendation			0
you have to write , and you have to finish what you write and beyond that , it 's all detail .			0
