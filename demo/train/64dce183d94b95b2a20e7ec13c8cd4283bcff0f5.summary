-- @entity1 says she 's optimistic about her mother 's chances if the former @entity5 governor decides to run for president			1
" i think she 's so smart and i think she could debate anyone and do very well , " @entity1 said in an interview with @entity9 's " dr. @entity8 " that aired thursday night			1
" i think that people will be talking about my family and her and everyone else , no matter what we 're doing , " she added			2
when the show 's host , dr. @entity8 , asked whether she liked the attention , @entity1 said she had mixed feelings			1
" i do n't know how to feel about it			0
i think there 's awesome opportunities that come with it , but then i also think there 's lots of drawbacks and lots of negatives towards it , " she said			2
" but i think whatever she ( @entity32 ) does will be right for our family and right for herself			2
" @entity1 's life changed dramatically when her mother , former @entity5 gov. @entity32 , became @entity40 's vice presidential running mate in 2008			1
shortly afterward , the revelation that @entity1 was 17 and pregnant put a national spotlight on her personal life			1
in her new memoir , " not afraid of life : my @entity54 , " @entity1 -- now 20 -- writes about lying to her parents so she could go on a camping trip with friends -- a night that ended with the teenager losing her virginity to her boyfriend , @entity52 , while getting drunk off wine coolers			1
later in the book , @entity1 walks readers through her unwanted pregnancy with @entity52 , revealing details on their shaky relationship over the years			1
on thursday , she told @entity8 that being a teen mom to her son , trip , was tough			1
" my life , my teenage years were cut completely short			1
i was on the fast track to adulthood just in an instant because of that one decision , " she said			0
" and trip is just the love of my life			0
he is everything to me			0
but do i wish that he had a dad that was involved in his life ? absolutely			0
and do i wish that i had an education and a real career path ? absolutely			0
" even after the 2008 election , @entity1 did n't shy away from the spotlight			2
she competed on " @entity78 " last year , drawing support from fans but also sharp criticism ; one man reportedly shot his television when she made it to another week of the competition			0
" i just think that it 's so strange that they could have so much hate over a dance show , " she said			2
in july 2010 , @entity1 announced her engagement to @entity52 on the front page of @entity92			1
that -- @entity1 told @entity8 -- was " the biggest regret of my life			1
" " the day ( the magazine ) came out , he ( @entity52 ) comes to me and he says , ' hey this girl 's pregnant and it might be my baby			2
' ... so then from that day forward i was like , i 'm just done with that			0
trip does n't deserve this ( from ) his dad and i do n't deserve that ( from ) a potential husband , " she said			0
in thursday 's interview , @entity1 also addressed a more recent controversy -- whether she had plastic surgery			1
she reiterated previous denials of that accusation , saying an oral surgeon operated on her jaw in december to correct a longstanding problem			0
" i 'm so sick of people talking about it and i 'm so sick of appearance being an issue , " she said			0
but despite the increased scrutiny , @entity1 says she 's grateful her celebrity has given her a chance to speak about important topics , like teen pregnancy prevention			1
" with this book , i really do hope that other young girls will see all the foolish decisions ... and they can learn something from the mistakes that i made , " she said			0
" i 'm just so passionate about it , just warning other girls that it 's not an accessory on your hip , " she added			0
