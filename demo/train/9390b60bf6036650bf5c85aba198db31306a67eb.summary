-- are you worried that millionaires do n't have enough influence in our elections ? if you ca n't contribute more than $ 123,000 to politicians , are your free speech rights harmed ? at least 99 % of @entity9 would laugh at the absurdity of these questions , but not @entity12 , an @entity14 political donor			1
@entity12 v. @entity15 , his court challenge to the $ 123,200 aggregate contribution limit , has made it all the way to the @entity20 , where it will be heard on october 8			1
aggregate limits -- or the total someone can contribute to federal candidates and committees each two - year election cycle -- was previously before the @entity20			1
in @entity27 ( 1976 ) , the @entity20 found the limits constitutional because they prevent corruption of federal officeholders and government decisions			1
the court wrote , " but this quite modest restraint upon protected political activity serves to prevent evasion of the $ 1,000 contribution limitation by a person who might otherwise contribute massive amounts of money to a particular candidate " through " contributions to political committees likely to contribute to that candidate , or huge contributions to the candidate 's political party			1
" now , especially after throwing out a century 's worth of law approving restrictions on corporate campaign expenditures in rulings , including @entity51 , one would expect the @entity20 to leave some of its campaign finance precedents intact			2
with this challenge to another longstanding law , the court will have its chance			0
one argument advanced by @entity12 's supporters is that because the @entity51 decision unleashed millions of dollars in independent electoral spending , much of it from anonymous sources , the role of political parties has been diminished to the detriment of our political system			0
@entity12 supporters propose throwing out aggregate limits so the parties can raise more than $ 1 million from a single contributor			2
eliminating the aggregate limits would only invite more political corruption			2
first , it would provide another advantage for the tiny fraction of @entity9 who have the means to give so lavishly			0
in 2012 , only four out of 1,000 @entity9 made political contributions of $ 200 or more , and the proportion of @entity9 who give the maximum amount of contributions allowed under federal law is much smaller			1
by way of perspective , @entity12 challenges a contribution cap for individuals of $ 123,200 -- or more than twice the $ 51,017 the average @entity9 family earns a year before taxes			1
eliminating this " quite modest restraint " would further empower the very few @entity9 who can afford to give such sums , and it would bring us pretty close to the definition of oligarchy			0
second , the corruption that would arise from eliminating these limits is not hypothetical			0
the record presented to the @entity9 @entity20 in the case of @entity102 v @entity15 -- the decision that upheld the @entity105 campaign financing act -- confirmed that the parties can and do serve as conduits for huge donors seeking specific outcomes in @entity110 and state capitals across the country			2
not only does the lower court record make clear that large contributions buy access and influence -- read the depositions of sen. @entity118 , @entity119 ; @entity120 , @entity121 , and @entity122 , @entity123 -- but they also affect @entity126 action			1
for example , the court record shows that in 1996 , during @entity126 consideration of an amendment to benefit @entity131 , sen. @entity132 , @entity133 , said a senior senator suggested to him that he support the amendment because " they just gave us $ 100,000			0
" the record reports that a popular generic drug bill died in @entity141 in 2002 , shortly after two @entity143 congressional committees held a large gala fundraiser to raise almost $ 30 million in contributions			0
among the largest contributors to the gala were @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 sen. @entity154 , @entity155 , summed up the problem this way : " there 's a terrible appearance when the @entity160 , which passes by 78 votes through the @entity126 , is not allowed to be brought up in the @entity162 shortly after a huge fundraiser with multimillion - dollar contributions from the pharmaceutical drug companies who are opposed to the legislation			0
" third , allowing donors a direct route to funnel millions straight to parties and candidates will not stop the anonymous independent spending			0
these expenditures will persist because they offer distinct advantages : they allow donors to hide their identities from the public , and allow candidates to outsource the dirty work , like attack ads. if the @entity20 sides with @entity12 , all it will have done is open new routes for corruption without closing the old ones			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity187 .			0

@entity20 takes on a challenge to $ 123,200 aggregate campaign contribution limit
limit is the total you can give to federal candidates each two - year election cycle
@entity187 : if court gets rid of limits , it invites corruption and gives advantage to the rich
large contributions are corrupting , she says ; they buy access and influence to power
