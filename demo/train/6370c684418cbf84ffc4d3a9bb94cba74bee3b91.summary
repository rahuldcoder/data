-- how long have you and i known each other ? well , by my calculations , we go back quite some time			2
this can mean only one thing : it 's time for the monkey story			1
there are those who will suggest that even to hint at the monkey story is to bring immeasurable shame upon the good @entity15 name , that its mere mention invites the sort of familial acrimony and heartache seldom witnessed outside " @entity20			1
" still , i will tell the monkey story not because i want to -- but because i must			1
the monkey story takes place in the late 1960s			1
it was , as @entity25 used to sing , a time of innocence , a time of confidences			2
i wore a " @entity33 " flip and white vinyl go - go boots			2
those boots were made for walking , so i 'd walk two doors down the street to the @entity39 ' house because the @entity39 had the biggest color tv on the block , and it was impossible to fully appreciate a masterpiece like " @entity44 " in black - and - white			2
anyway , at some point between @entity48 's election and @entity50 's comeback concert , my mother and father , brother , and cousins all went to visit the grandparents in @entity56 ... but not the @entity56 you 're thinking of			1
you see , before @entity56 was filled with fabulously sexy models eating fabulously sexy food at fabulously sexy boutique hotels , it was filled with old people who had dinner at 5:30 and worshipped @entity64			0
as for entertainment , a kid could check out @entity67 at the wax museum , play a rousing game of bingo and still be bored silly by noon			0
and that , my friends , brings us to the monkey story			1
there was -- and i believe there probably still is -- a place in @entity77 called the @entity78			0
it had funny little monkeys swinging from vines overhead , it had monkey memorabilia that made monkey memories last forever , it even had a monkey that was trained to put his hairy little arms around your neck and smile for the camera			1
i could go on , but suffice it to say the place was lousy with monkeys , and my cousin @entity91 and i thought we 'd found paradise , complete with souvenir shop and snack bar			0
fact : @entity91 was holding a peanut			0
fact : there , high above a large cage of spider monkeys , hung a gigantic sign that read , " do not feed the monkeys			0
" fact : i was always an inquisitive child , a sucker for an educational science project , if you will , and			0
. hell , i wanted to know what would happen if i fed the monkeys			0
okay , strike that , i wanted to know what would happen if somebody fed the monkeys			0
and there was sweet @entity91 with her cherry pink cheeks and her enormous angel eyes and her layers of dark , curly hair that rioted around that innocent freckled face , tangling and untangling according to the humidity , and , lo and behold , there was her peanut			1
" @entity91 , " i whispered with perfect nonchalance , " go see if that monkey wants your peanut			1
" this next part happened rather quickly , and my recollection is a little hazy			0
if memory serves , @entity91 walked over to the monkey cage and held the peanut up to the bars			1
the monkey took the peanut , and i could see @entity91 beaming with pride as she turned to look at me			1
unfortunately , i could also see the monkey toss the peanut over its shoulder , reach its menacing monkey paw between the bars , grab a chunk of @entity91 's hair , and yank it out of her terrified little head			1
i do n't know how many of you have ever had to act as lookout while your mother crouches in a closet as she attempts to hide from her mother - in - law while phoning every pediatrician in the greater @entity56 area to inquire about any potential issues that might arise , " if , say , for example , your 5 - year - old niece happens to be mauled by a deranged monkey			1
" wait a minute , i do know			0
none of you have had to do that , because i 'm the only person in the universe who 's ever sent her darling cousin out to be attacked by a monkey			1
in any case , the name of the column is " @entity15 tells all , " and now i 've told you all the monkey story			1
it was the first bad thing i ever did -- and i remember being shocked that @entity168 did n't lead with it that night on the evening news			0
i guess @entity171 knows his stuff -- it really was a time of innocence			0
my family had n't yet been touched by debt or divorce or death , and betrayal never amounted to more than a little bit of monkey business			2
the grown - ups smoked , the children tanned , we all ate red meat , and everybody thought they would live forever			0
but by the summer of ' 67 , my hometown of @entity188 was burning around us , and -- thanks to @entity190 , @entity191 , and a war we were assured was winnable -- the shelf life on forever officially expired in 1968			0
@entity91 eventually became @entity194 , an @entity195 attorney with a lovely husband , two terrific kids and a major aversion to " @entity199			0
" because my cousin is a charitable soul , and because she understood that i would do a much better job of beating myself up than she ever could , and mostly because her hair grew back , @entity91 still speaks to me			2
of course , these days the conversations tend to include a lot more about politics and eye lifts than we ever would have imagined back when we played shuffleboard at our grandparents ' condominium			0
the monkey story does occasionally come up , because it turns out you ca n't really have a monkey take a swipe at your head without mentioning it from time to time			1
but for the record , @entity91 laughs when she tells the story			2
she 's always been slightly sunnier than me -- on a bad day , i can make @entity221 look like a rodeo clown			1
and i 've always been slightly funnier than @entity91 -- though she might argue that this is because i 've never been attacked by a giant spider monkey			2
i still struggle with impulse control and guilt and the deeply unsettling truth that i am actually quite capable of hurting the people i adore , that , given the right set of circumstances , we all are			1
@entity91 and i are both a lot older and a little wiser now , and we 've learned to pay close attention when a warning sign is posted right there in front of our eyes			0
we fasten our seat belts , we leave the tags on our mattresses , we refuse to operate heavy machinery after a tablespoon of @entity245 -- and under no circumstances do we ever feed the monkeys			0
