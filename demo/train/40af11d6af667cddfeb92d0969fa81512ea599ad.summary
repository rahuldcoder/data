@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 parliament members adjourned on saturday without reaching an accord on a controversial new elections law , and the lawmakers could make another try to forge and pass legislation tomorrow			0
@entity12 and @entity13 , @entity10 members of the @entity11 , told @entity2 that the session is adjourned until sunday because lawmakers did n't forge an agreement			0
passage of the law on sunday is expected to ensure that national elections would be held on january 16			1
@entity20 said several @entity23 @entity22 parliament members boycotted the saturday session and doubts there will be a sunday vote			0
@entity13 told @entity2 that lawmakers could n't reach an accord over the issue of @entity30 and said some @entity23 and @entity32 members left the session			2
but the biggest roadblock to a new election law is the question of how balloting should unfold in the ethnically diverse , oil - rich province of @entity30 , where @entity38 displaced during @entity40 's rule have returned to claim their land			1
the power struggle among @entity38 , @entity22 and @entity32 has been a political hot potato			0
@entity38 have long regarded @entity30 -- the province and the city of the same name -- as an integral part of @entity10 , and many want it to be part of @entity1 's autonomous @entity10 region			1
arabs and @entity32 also lay claim to the city and province , and all the groups want their voices and votes to be adequately represented in the political system			1
disgruntled @entity22 and @entity32 residents say many more @entity38 have moved into @entity30 than were displaced , and that allowing them to vote would create an unfair advantage			1
arabs and @entity32 want special measures to adjust for the increased numbers because they believe many of the @entity10 immigrants are there illegally			2
the @entity38 insist there should be no special voting procedures and reject a @entity68 ' proposal that singles out @entity30 for special treatment			0
the disagreements among the groups spurred the postponement of provincial elections in @entity30 last january because officials there could not agree on how to apportion seats among the ethnic groups .			0

new election law will ensure that national elections take place january 16
biggest roadblock is how balloting should unfold in @entity30 , where @entity38 stake claim to land
@entity38 regard @entity30 as part of @entity10 ; arabs and @entity32 also lay claim to it
