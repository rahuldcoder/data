@entity0 , @entity1 -- initial results from test runs of a ship billed as the world 's largest oil skimming vessel could come back monday after a weekend spent plowing the seas atop the undersea gusher in the @entity10			1
the converted cargo ship @entity12 spent the weekend attempting to separate crude oil from seawater in a 25 - square - mile area north of the ruptured @entity17 oil well at the heart of the disaster			2
if the test is successful , the massive vessel could play a key role in efforts to clean up the largest oil spill in @entity26 history			2
initial results from tests are expected monday , @entity27 , spokesman for the company that owns the ship , said			1
the ship , which swallows water with oil then separates it , can skim about 21 million gallons of oil a day			0
that 's at least 250 times the amount that modified fishing vessels currently conducting skimming operations have been able to contain , according to @entity42 company @entity41 shipping , which owns the vessel			0
a total of about 550 skimming vessels were out in the @entity10 on sunday , according to a spokeswoman for the @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity1			1
but with oil still pouring into the sea at a rate of tens of thousands of barrels a day , federal authorities closed a new section of the @entity10 off @entity1 to fishing on sunday			1
the latest order from the @entity56 adds nearly 1,100 square miles of federal waters off @entity1 's @entity58 to the off - limits zone			1
the new closure brings the portion of the @entity10 closed to fishing due to the massive @entity17 spill off @entity1 to 33.2 percent , @entity56 reported			1
the @entity63 reported earlier sunday that a shift in weather patterns could send more oil toward sensitive shores in @entity68 and @entity1 , and bad weather over the past few days has significantly hampered cleanup efforts			1
" the weather is one challenge you ca n't defeat , " @entity63 adm. @entity71 said			2
ribbons of oil stripe the water for miles , but waves saturday were still too high for boats to skim oil off the water			0
" at the @entity63 , we do take it personally			2
it is portrayed as mission failure any time oil washes ashore , " he said			2
@entity71 said he will put the skimmers back to work as soon as the sea calms			0
researchers have estimated that between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels ( 1.5 million to 2.5 million gallons ) of oil have been gushing into the @entity10 daily since april 20 , when the @entity94 oil rig exploded and sank off the coast of @entity1			1
the @entity12 arrived in the @entity10 on wednesday and has been awaiting approval to join in cleanup efforts			0
the skimmer works by " taking in oily water through a series of vents , or jaws , on the side of the ship and then decanting the intake , " @entity27 said			0
" in many ways , the ship collects water like an actual whale and pumps internally like a human heart			0
" @entity71 said he is also calling in reinforcements , including 300 new skimmers in the next two weeks			1
for the 12 - hour period from midnight until noon saturday , approximately 7,980 barrels ( 335,160 gallons ) of oil were collected and about 4,155 barrels ( 174,510 gallons ) of oil and 28.3 million cubic feet of natural gas were flared , @entity17 said			0
the company said about 25,290 barrels ( 1,062,180 gallons ) of oil were recovered friday			0
@entity2 's @entity116 contributed to this report .			0
