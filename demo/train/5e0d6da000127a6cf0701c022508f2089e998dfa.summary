-- hanging just above the reception at @entity2 is a long , white pole			0
as tourists flock to the iconic " @entity6 " they gaze toward the slightly discolored and aging artifact			0
in days gone past , some would rub it			0
some would simply walk past while muttering " @entity13 " under their breath			0
but to underestimate the contribution of this seemingly lifeless piece of apparatus would be criminal			0
some 47 years since that pole played an integral role in deciding the 1966 @entity22 final , @entity17 , the game 's governing body , has announced that goal - line technology will be used at the tournament in @entity25 in 2014			1
when tourists take the grand tour of @entity2 , they begin at the " @entity28 " where they will find that iconic feature still hanging to this day			0
it was on july 30 , 1966 that @entity31 appeared to fire @entity32 into a 3 - 2 lead on the way to victory over @entity36			2
@entity31 's effort , which hit the crossbar and bounced down " over " the line , was awarded by referee @entity40 and @entity42 linesman @entity41 amid heavy protestations @entity32 eventually went on to win the contest 4 - 2 , lifting the @entity46 trophy for the first and only time			1
yet , even now , following years of fierce debate and the introduction of technology , nobody has definitively proved whether the correct decision was made that day			2
fast forward to the @entity54 and it was @entity32 which once again furthered the case for the introduction of technology			2
@entity59 's strike , ironically against @entity36 , was not awarded by @entity61 referee @entity60 , despite the ball quite clearly landing over the goal line			1
to the entire watching world , it was a goal			2
but not the one man who mattered			0
the incident , which occurred under the watching gaze of @entity17 president @entity69 , convinced the @entity71 administrator that technology should be introduced sooner rather than later			1
goal - line technology ( @entity74 ) was successfully trialled at last year 's @entity75 in @entity76 and will be used at the @entity77 in @entity25 this june ahead of the @entity78 in the same country , @entity17 said tuesday			1
" the aim is to use @entity74 in order to support the match officials and to install a system in all stadia , pending the successful installation , and pre-match referee tests , " it said in a statement			0
" with different technologies on the market , @entity17 has launched a tender today , setting out the technical requirements for the two forthcoming competitions in @entity25			1
" goal - line technology approved in soccer the news will be widely greeted , and with some relief , following a whole host of incidents in recent years			1
at the 2012 @entity102 finals , @entity100 was denied a goal against @entity32 when @entity105 's shot crossed the @entity107 goal line but was not given			1
there have been several other instances , from @entity117 ' " goal " for @entity118 at @entity119 in 2005 through to @entity111 's header for @entity112 in another @entity114 match at @entity115 last year which was not given , despite replays showing it had quite clearly gone over the line			1
two rival systems have been given licenses by @entity17 : @entity125 , which is similar to the system used at the wimbledon tennis tournament ; and @entity128 from @entity36			1
@entity17 expects others to enter the bidding , which is open until mid-march , with a final decision to be made in april			2
@entity125 uses " triangulation " to pinpoint the exact location of the football			0
if it crosses the goal line , then an encrypted radio signal is sent to the referee 's wristwatch to indicate a goal has been scored			1
in line with @entity17 's requirements , the whole process takes less than a second to complete			1
@entity128 uses a microchip implanted in the ball and low magnetic waves around the goal			0
the system detects any change in the magnetic field on or behind the goal line to determine if a goal has been scored and alerts the ref. @entity154 , head of @entity157 football 's ruling body @entity155 , remains a staunch opponent of the use of such technology			1
a football purist , @entity154 has maintained his position , despite incidents such as @entity100 's " goal " at @entity165			2
@entity155 does not use goal - line technology in its @entity168 and @entity169 competitions			1
instead , it persists with the use of extra officials behind the goal to inform the referee 's decisions			2
speaking to the media last june , @entity154 said : " the goal between @entity32 and @entity100 : it was a goal			2
it was a mistake from the referee			0
but there was an offside before then			0
" if the officials had given offside there would n't have been a goal			0
so why do n't we have technology for offside decisions as well ? where does it stop ? it 's not goal - line technology in itself			1
" i am against technology coming into force to actually make decisions			0
it invades every single area			0
if tomorrow someone handballs it on the line and the referee does n't see it , what then ? " we ca n't just have goal - line technology			1
we also need sensors to see if someone has handballed it			0
" we need cameras to see if it should be a goal or not			0

@entity17 confirms that goal - line technology will be used at the @entity78
technology was successfully trialled at last year 's @entity75 in @entity76
system will be in place for @entity77 in @entity25 this june
@entity17 has opened tender and is expecting *multiple* bids for rights
