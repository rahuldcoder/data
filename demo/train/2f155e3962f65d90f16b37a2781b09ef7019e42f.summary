@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is ready when a fellow student says " no thanks " to early voting because of the thrill of casting a ballot on @entity8			1
" things come up , you can have an exam , " says @entity3 , the president of the @entity9			0
" you can wait until @entity8 and not know where your precinct is			2
a lot of students have to go to elementary schools around town , and they do n't have cars , they do n't really know where it is			0
" truth is , @entity3 knows younger voters like herself are less reliable when it comes to turning out in the crunch , and " with early voting , it just gives us 40 more chances to catch people			1
" @entity3 led by example thursday , waiting in line for more than an hour to cast her ballot on the first day of in - person early voting in @entity1			1
the line at the @entity36 was dominated by @entity38 voters , as was a @entity40 polling place @entity2 visited as the doors opened thursday			0
@entity3 says the @entity38 campaign and state @entity43 have urged her to keep checking her list and pushing students to vote now			2
" if you vote early , it frees up campaign resources to talk to people who might be undecided , " she told us as she waited patiently to vote			0
@entity1 is one of 35 states plus the @entity54 that allow some form of early in - person voting			1
of the nine presidential battlegrounds @entity2 now rates as tossups , only @entity56 and @entity57 do not have large - scale early voting			1
in voting , the early bird skips the line in @entity1 four years ago , early voting accounted for 36 % of the ballots cast for president			1
in @entity68 , home of the @entity9 , it was 55 % , the highest of @entity1 's 99 counties , and county auditor @entity70 says demand for early ballots so far is up significantly from 2008			2
key states voting early and @entity43 have a big early edge			1
in @entity68 , requests for mail - in ballots as of monday were running more than 12 - 1 in favor of @entity43			2
@entity82 , as of close of business wednesday , the @entity1 secretary of state 's office said @entity43 had a nearly 5 - 1 edge in making requests for absentee ballots			1
republicans here do n't dispute the early @entity43 advantage in ballot requests			2
but they promise to narrow the edge somewhat ; the @entity92 's first mailing nudging republicans to consider mail - in voting was sent just this week			2
@entity1 @entity86 also suggest too much can be made of the early numbers , making the case that those voting before the presidential debates are hardcore partisans who were almost certain to vote eventually anyway			1
" if you look at who is early - voting right now , absentee ballots , 80 % , almost 90 % , are ' four of four ' voters , meaning they voted in the last four elections , " veteran @entity1 @entity92 strategist @entity100 told @entity2			1
" so it 's a difference of strategy			0
you put your money into the last three weeks or you put your money into early voting			1
the @entity86 will put a little more into the last three weeks , and the @entity43 a little more into the first initial blast of early voting			1
" @entity100 said one effort in which @entity43 were smart to focus so much early voting attention was younger voters			1
" four years ago there was a lot of enthusiasm among younger voters and everybody knows that has lessened , " @entity100 said			0
" they have got to figure out the strategy to increase their early voting			2
" polls : @entity38 leads in @entity56 , tight race in @entity127 , @entity128 on the flip side , he said @entity86 @entity130 runs stronger among the state 's elderly voters , who are among the most reliable to cast ballots			2
more broadly , @entity100 conceded a modest @entity38 edge in @entity1 at the moment and said there is nervous talk among some @entity86 that @entity130 could hurt @entity92 candidates in competitive congressional and other races			1
in his view , such talk is premature			0
" clearly if a ( presidential ) candidate loses by more than five , it starts to affect down - ballot and that 's a big issue for @entity86 , " @entity100 said			0
" the way i look at it , we are starting the fourth quarter			0
we have a strong quarterback			0
and anyone who knows football knows the fourth quarter is where most of the action happens			0
so october will be big ; and if @entity130 has a good start to the month , we will be fine			0
" @entity1 @entity86 also say , despite the @entity43 edge in early voting so far , that the @entity92 is breaking records in terms of its grassroots organizing			1
at a @entity165 phone bank in @entity166 , volunteer @entity162 ( pronounced @entity163 ) is credited with making the millionth voter call in @entity1 this cycle			0
she is pleasantly working the phones again this week , and adding this question when a voter indicates support for the @entity174 ticket : " excellent			0
would you be interested in voting early this election ? " @entity162 says @entity1 's unpredictable winters make her a fan of early and absentee voting , and she shrugs off the early @entity43 edge in absentee ballot requests as temporary			1
" you know we are working hard here , " @entity162 said during a quick break from working the phones			0
" we are rolling up our sleeves and putting our boots on , and we are going at it			0
" what questions would you like to ask the candidates ? share with us on @entity193			0

@entity1 is first battleground state to open early voting and one of 35 states that allow it
@entity43 have edge in those voting early , but @entity86 *downplay* *importance*
@entity1 @entity86 say they *'ll* put their efforts into last three weeks before @entity8
@entity92 concedes @entity43 ' early voting efforts but claims records in grassroots organizing
