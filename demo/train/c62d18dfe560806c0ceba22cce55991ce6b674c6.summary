as a noted memoirist and @entity3 columnist who writes often about race , @entity0 has spoken about the police killings of @entity7 and @entity8 , deaths that sparked a national debate over how police treat @entity13 men			1
on monday , @entity0 wrote about another young black man 's encounter with police -- his son , who was allegedly held at gunpoint on the @entity19 campus where he 's a student			1
@entity0 took to @entity20 on sunday , writing that he was " fuming " after his son called to tell him what happened saturday -- that he was walking out of the library when university police " accosted " him and drew their weapons			1
@entity0 tweeted that his son was detained because he " fit the description " of a suspect			1
blow 's son was released , and @entity19 has said that the real suspect was found and arrested later			1
the columnist 's son was shaken			2
on monday , @entity0 told @entity5 that his son is back in class and feeling better			1
" he 's a good kid , and just wants to go to school			0
but one thing that he told me was really astute and worth sharing : he does n't want this story to only be about him , " @entity0 said			2
" he realizes that there are other young people who have fewer privileges , less access and endure even greater traumas , but whose stories go unreported until something truly tragic happens			0
he wants the focus to remain on them			0
i could n't be prouder of him for having the wisdom to recognize that			0
" sunday night , the columnist was incredibly angry after he says his son called him to explain what happened			1
" # i ca n't breathe and # blacklives matter , " @entity0 posted in a series of tweets			2
" this is exactly why i have no patience for ppl trying to convince me that the fear these young blk men feel is n't real # @entity63 , " the columnist wrote in tweets that were shared hundreds of thousands of times			0
@entity19 released a statement monday that said @entity0 's son was detained in the vicinity of a reported crime , and that he closely matched the physical description of the suspect			1
" let us be clear : we have great faith in the @entity71 and admire the professionalism that its officers display on a daily basis to keep our campus safe			0
what happened ... is not a replay of what happened in @entity79 ; @entity80 ; @entity81 ; or so many other places in our time and over time in the @entity84			0
the officer , who himself is @entity13 , was responding to a specific description relayed by individuals who had reported a crime in progress , " it read			1
the statement continued : " even though the officer 's decision to stop and detain the student may have been reasonable , the fact that he drew his weapon during the stop requires a careful review			2
" the school promised to share the results of that investigation with the broader community			0
on sunday , @entity19 spokeswoman @entity104 wrote in email that @entity19 police responded to an emergency call from undergraduates in a residential community on campus , saying that someone had " entered their rooms under false pretenses , pretending to be looking for someone			1
" students in the same community had been burglarized that week , @entity104 explained , and the police were looking for someone who was " a tall , @entity13 , college - aged student wearing a black jacket and a red and white hat			1
" the real suspect was later found on an adjacent residential community , was arrested and is expected to face felony burglary charges , according to @entity104			0
@entity0 declined sunday to talk to @entity5 about the incident , but he gave a detailed account in his @entity3 column of what his son said happened			1
when his son was leaving the @entity19 library around 5:45 p.m. saturday , he saw an officer " jogging " toward the entrance of another building across the grounds			1
blow 's son recounted to his father that he started walking back to his dorm when he noticed a police officer following him and then speaking into his radio , saying , " i got him			1
" the officer shouted , " hey , turn around ! " according to @entity0 's recounting of his son 's story			1
the officer raised his gun and told the college student to get on the ground			1
blow 's son , the columnist writes , dropped to his knees , raised his hand and laid down on his stomach			1
he was then asked for his name and where he went to school			0
the student answered , according to the columnist			2
then the officer told him to get up , gave the student his name and told the student to call him the next day , according to the column 's retelling			2
then @entity0 's son said he got up and started to walk back to his dorm			2
according to @entity0 , his son told him : " ' i was scared			2
my legs were shaking slightly			0
after a few more paces , the officer , ' hey , my man			0
can you step off to the side ? ' " the student did as he was told			0
then one officer asked him to turn around to get a better view of the jacket the student was wearing			2
the officer asked for the student 's name again and his @entity173			0
blow 's son complied , according to the columnist			0
then the officer held him longer , asking more questions , @entity0 writes			1
" now , do n't get me wrong : if indeed my son matched the description of a suspect , i would have had no problem with him being questioned appropriately , " @entity0 wrote in the @entity3			2
" school is his community , his home away from home , and he would have appreciated reasonable efforts to keep it safe			0
the stop is not the problem ; the method of the stop is the problem			0
" @entity0 wrote that the dean of @entity19 and the university police chief have apologized to him			1
" why was a gun drawn first ? why was he not immediately told why he was being detained ? why not ask for @entity173 first ? what if my son had panicked under the stress , having never had a gun pointed at him before , and made what the officer considered a ' suspicious ' movement ? had i come close to losing him ? " triggers can not be unpulled			1
bullets can not be called back , " @entity0 wrote			0
" this is the scenario i have always dreaded : my son at the wrong end of a gun barrel , face down on the concrete , " he added			0
" i had always dreaded the moment that we would share stories about encounters with the police in which our lives hung in the balance , intergenerational stories of joining the inglorious ' club			0
