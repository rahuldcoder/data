@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 authorities are asking for the public 's help to find a group of " foxy thieves " they say are drugging men they pick up at high - end bars and stealing tens of thousands of dollars in cash , jewelry , guns and other valuables			1
the @entity15 released photos of the four suspects , all in their 20s , and have attained arrest warrants for them			2
investigators suspect there may be more women involved in the ring			1
" they 're attractive women that go into a bar and they have a scam and they work it again and again , " said @entity24 , a spokeswoman for the sheriff 's office			2
the scam works like this : go to an upscale bar , flirt with a middle - age or older man wearing expensive jewelry , go back to his home , slip a drug in his drink , rob him and leave before he wakes up			1
this is what @entity40 , 25 , @entity41 , 25 , @entity42 , 27 and @entity43 , 23 , have allegedly been doing for the past few months in upscale bars in @entity1			1
hours after authorities released images of the suspects to the news media on thursday , @entity46 turned herself in to @entity53 police , the @entity15 said friday			1
investigators have identified four of the women 's victims , @entity24 said , adding that they believe other victims " have n't come forward because they 're embarrassed			1
" " this investigation is by no means over , " she added			2
" we anticipate identifying other suspects and other victims			1
" @entity65 , 54 , told @entity2 two of the suspects paired up when they worked the scam on him			0
@entity65 said met the two women at @entity70 , a popular bar in @entity0 's business district , and the three left the bar for his house			0
there , @entity65 said , one of the women distracted him while the other made him a drink			0
" i got drugged , " @entity65 said			0
the next thing @entity65 remembers is waking up to discover over $ 250,000 worth of his personal items gone -- handguns , diamonds and a @entity85 watch he was wearing -- along with the women			0
" it could have been worse , " he noted			0
" they could have shot me with my own handgun			0
" the women , who allegedly used fake names during their ruses , are each being charged with one count of grand theft			0
@entity96 authorities are eager to get these women in custody			1
the sheriff 's office has joined with @entity101 to offer a $ 1,000 reward for anonymous tips that lead to an arrest			0
" we really want to get these women off the street ... because they 're drugging their victims , presumably , " @entity24 said			2
" we do n't know how long it will be before they end up killing somebody accidentally			2
