perhaps the most sought - after red carpet invitation in the world			0
and @entity3 turned it down			1
it says a lot about the 53 - year - old chief executive of @entity8 , who today announced she would be leaving the @entity10 clothing firm to join technology giant @entity11 as its new vice president for retail and online stores			1
this is a woman who prioritizes family above all -- and that includes rubbing shoulders with the @entity19 of @entity20 at lavish gala events			0
the same mother - of - three who married her childhood sweetheart @entity24 , and reportedly tries to limit herself to one night out a week			1
and the same woman who this year became the first female to top @entity10 's executive pay league , taking home a total £ 16.9 million ( $ 27 million )			0
unsurprisingly , " balance " is a big word in @entity3 ' life			1
she turned down an invite to the @entity0 because : " it 's not more important than my husband			1
it 's not more important than my kids			0
it 's not more important than @entity8 , " she said in an interview with @entity10 newspaper @entity37			2
" i do n't want to be a great executive without being a great mom and a great wife			0
i do n't want to look back and say i wish i had done things differently			0
" fashion forward growing up as one of six siblings in the small town of @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity3 gained a merchandise and marketing degree from @entity51 before rising up the ranks of fashion houses @entity54 , @entity55 , and @entity56			1
in 2006 she headed to @entity10 , joining @entity8 as its ceo , and revitalizing the century - old company which had seen its iconic check pattern become the favored print of minor celebrities and rip - off merchants			1
indeed , @entity3 has been credited with rescuing the @entity8 brand from the clutches of the masses and placing it on the top shelf of luxury living			1
thanks to @entity69 , @entity8 is now not only cool but synonymous with glamor			2
revenues have nearly tripled to more than $ 3 billion and @entity72 herself was catapulted to 53 on the @entity75 list this year			0
watch : @entity3 -- ' profits are up ' " @entity8 is in brilliant shape , " said @entity72 in a statement today			1
" having built the industry 's most powerful management team , converted the business to a dynamic digital global retailer , created a world class supply chain , state of the art technology infrastructure , sensational brand momentum and one of the most closely connected creative cultures in the world today			0
" she will be replaced by chief creative officer @entity90 , who has been in the role for six years , and her departure means there are now just two female chief executives in the @entity96 -- @entity98 chief @entity97 and @entity100 's @entity99			0
@entity102 generation what 's the secret to @entity3 ' enormous success ? a seemingly indefatigable work ethic appears to be one			2
this , after all , is the woman who reportedly rises at 4.35am and has a reliance on @entity110			0
but there 's also been her ability to tap into a new generation of digital consumers relying on social media for fashion trends , and increasingly buying online			2
@entity8 's @entity119 campaign video gained over one million @entity121 views in just 48 hours			2
and the luxury brand now has 16 million fans on @entity102 and more than two million followers on @entity125			0
wander around @entity8 's @entity127 flagship store on @entity128 and you 'll find sales assistants armed with @entity131			2
meanwhile mirrors transform into screens displaying catwalk images thanks to special technology sewn into some clothing and accessories			0
what 's more is that the actual store has been redesigned to recreate an experience that reflects the company 's website , @entity143			0
" @entity8 is a company that 's been around 155 years			2
everything is for the long term , " she told @entity147 of her marketing plan in 2011			0
after her seven years at @entity8 , what @entity69 will be most remembered for is her digital first approach that helped revitalize the century old fashion house into an upmarket luxury brand			1
@entity154 this space ? @entity69 ' fashion credentials helped her breathe new life into a @entity10 clothing institution			1
but with rumors that @entity11 is now keen to use her expertise on its new @entity154 , could they also boost a sector increasingly delving into wearable technology ? after all , @entity11 's decision to hire @entity69 comes just three months after it recruited @entity166 , the former chief executive of @entity168 luxury group @entity167			1
and if anybody 's up to the job of keeping up with cool kids of fashion , it 's @entity3 .			1

who is @entity3 , new @entity11 vice president of retail and online ?
mother - of - three snubbed the @entity0 to spend time with family
grew up one of six siblings in @entity48 and *dreamed* of working in fashion
helped turn around @entity8 , fashion know - how may be used in new @entity11 @entity154
