-- the @entity1 is one of earth 's remote places ; it is not easy to get to , and it is quite wild			2
independent travel there is not for the inexperienced or the faint - hearted			0
there are few roads and those that exist are difficult to drive and navigate and subject to flooding and other hazards ; communications are spotty at best and locations are distantly apart			0
winning and losing on @entity14 's @entity1 the vast majority of tourists fly into camps in the delta , many from the town of @entity21 , which is easily reached by scheduled airlines from @entity14 's capital , @entity24 ( @entity25 ) , from @entity26 , @entity27 ( @entity28 ) , from @entity29 , @entity30 ( @entity31 ) , and from @entity32 , @entity33			1
from @entity21 , a host of bush plane companies fly tourists to the camps and reserves , most of which , including @entity40 , are privately owned and operated			1
most tourists make their arrangements through organized tour companies , and there is no shortage of tour operators in southern @entity27 who can arrange an all - inclusive visit			0
more resourceful travelers can save money by making their own arrangements using the @entity52 to identify individual camps , and arranging transportation and accommodations directly through them			0
the camps vary from luxury suites to basic pup tents , and prices reflect the differences			1
@entity61 is mid- to upper range , offering heavy canvas tents on wood platforms with full beds and in - tent plumbed bathrooms , full board and a host of activities , including overland jeep safaris , dugout canoe trips and motorboat journeys that are included in the basic price			2
less expensive camps , such as @entity76 , feature simple pup tents on platforms , but can be hundreds of dollars less expensive			1
some camps are fenced to keep animals out at night , while others such as @entity82 are not ( if the sound of a two - ton elephant or hippopotamus tramping through the bushes right outside your window unnerves you , you might want to opt for a fenced camp )			2
@entity14 is deliberately expensive , as the government wishes to limit the number of tourists who visit @entity1 to lessen environmental impact			0
rates during high season ( july - october ) can be twice as high as during low season ( november - june )			1
try going during low season , just before or after high season , to maximize wildlife viewing but minimize cost			2
for most upscale camps , plan on us $ 900 - $ 1,600 per person , per night in high season , and a low of about $ 700 in low season			1
for mid-range camps , plan on about $ 700 - $ 950 in high season , as low as $ 350 in low season			1
for basic camps , looks for rates as low as $ 340 per person , per night in high season and $ 240 in low season			1
most rates are all - inclusive , including lodging , food and all safaris and other activities			0
tourists on tighter budgets might want to consider camps in @entity27 , although they tend to be less wild and more tourist - populated			0
large animals including lion , zebra , hippopotamus , wildebeest , elephant and others are abundant in the @entity121 , and while it is thrilling to see them , tourists must always remember , this is not a zoo			0
but as long as visitors follow a few simple rules , there is little danger .			0

the @entity1 is difficult to access ; most tourists arrive by bush plane
camp accommodations range from luxury suites to basic pup tents
for mid-range camps , plan on about $ 700 - $ 950 per person , per night in high season
