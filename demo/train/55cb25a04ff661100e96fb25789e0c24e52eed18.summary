-- as the @entity1 prepares to hear arguments in the constitutionality of the health care reform law , @entity0 spoke with two experts on opposing sides of the issue			1
@entity8 is the founding executive director of @entity9 , a 30 - year - old nonprofit supporting " the achievement of high - quality , affordable health care for all @entity12			1
" the group worked with the @entity15 administration and members of @entity17 to help pass the @entity18			1
( @entity19 of the @entity20 is against the health care reform law			1
read her viewpoint here )			0
the following interview with @entity8 is edited for clarity and brevity : @entity0 : from your perspective , what does the @entity18 accomplish ? @entity8 : " @entity18 moves us very close to achieving health coverage for everyone			1
the only people who would be excluded would be people who immigrated to the country and do not have documentation			2
those who currently have coverage in the workplace will continue to do so			2
in fact , small businesses , which have the greatest difficulty paying for health care coverage for their workers , are already receiving tax credit subsidies to make such employer - supported insurance more affordable			1
" preview : ' the implications ... are impossible to overstate ' @entity0 : what is your message to the @entity1 as they take on this legal challenge ? @entity8 : " i think that the claims that have been made challenging the constitutional validity of different portions of the @entity18 are very weak claims			1
it 's my hope that the justices protect the law and allow the law to go into effect			1
it 's reform that 's way overdue , it really is going to help the @entity12 public , even if much of the public is not even aware of the provisions that have yet to be implemented			2
and it 's my hope that the court allows these provisions to go into effect			2
i think as these provisions do , they will be very popular			0
" @entity0 : does the fact it is an election year make this health care issue more politically charged ? @entity8 : " we took 16 of the key elements of the @entity18 and compared them to the @entity76 health reform [ supported by then - gov. @entity77 , now a leading @entity78 candidate for president ] , and they 're virtually identical			1
this criticism of the @entity18 is more political than it is substantive			1
the reforms that were adopted in @entity76 truly were a model for the @entity18 and even gov. @entity77 at one point not too long ago indicated that he thought it would be a good model for the nation			1
" much of the ideas that are not considered controversial were ideas that were originally introduced by @entity78			0
having this new marketplace called exchanges -- that 's a @entity78 idea			2
it 's creating a private marketplace for private insurance			2
i do n't think that , innately , these are controversial items			0
they 've become controversial because of the politics of the moment			0
if president @entity15 supports something , @entity78 will oppose it , not because they opposed it in the past			0
" @entity0 : what are some of the major changes ? @entity8 : " 50 million uninsured -- most people ca n't grasp that figure -- will get coverage in two main ways			1
the law provides for an expansion of the @entity115 program			2
if you either live alone or in a household that has income below 133 % of the poverty level , then you will be eligible for @entity115			0
in 42 states , you could be penniless and not qualify for coverage -- adults with no children			2
the @entity18 creates a floor under which nobody can fall			1
two families , two viewpoints on health reform " the second change is for people with incomes just above 133 % [ of the poverty level ]			1
for many of those people , it 's unaffordable -- $ 14,000 on average for family coverage			1
the new law allows you to go into a new private marketplace -- called exchanges -- and you can select an insurance plan that 's in the exchange			1
you will get a tax credit subsidy to make the premiums more affordable			0
" right now , people seeking insurance when they have pre-existing conditions , are told : ' we 're not going to sell insurance to you			1
' or if they can get insurance : ' we 're not going to cover the condition that drove you to desire the coverage			2
we 're not going to cover your diabetes , your asthma			0
' that affects huge numbers of people			2
the people who need insurance the most are going to get this protection			2
the companies also can not charge discriminatory premiums			0
" a huge portion of the population that has insurance is limited on how much the insurance will pay out			0
those limitations come in two forms -- we 're not going to pay out more than ' x ' number of dollars per year , and we 're not going to pay more than ' y ' dollars over the life of the insurance policy			0
the @entity18 eliminates both of those			1
" a significant portion of the premium does not actually go to your health care -- instead [ it goes ] to advertising and marketing , administrative costs , agents ' fees , profits			2
the @entity18 now places limitations on how much can be spent for those nonhealth benefit costs from your premium dollars			1
for small plans , at least 80 cents on the dollar must be spent on actual coverage			0
for larger plans , it 's 85 cents on the dollar			0
the law is going to create some cost efficiencies			0
" @entity0 : you argue seniors also benefit under the law			0
@entity8 : " there are a host of insurance market reforms that are very valuable			1
for senior citizens , you do n't think of them as uninsured			0
however , seniors have significant gaps in coverage			0
two of the most prominent gaps are dealt with in the @entity18			1
" for prescriptions , three - quarters of the cost is covered			0
then around $ 2,500 , you go into a no - coverage zone , euphemistically called the ' doughnut hole			0
' at that point , you 're on your own			0
the @entity18 eliminates that hole in coverage			1
" @entity214 requires out - of - pocket cost for preventive care			0
now there 's no out - of - pocket costs			0
it tries to move @entity214 from a sick - care coverage to a health - care coverage			1
you can get you checkup each year , tests , screenings , that some people do n't get because they have to pay out of pocket and as a result , the condition does not get diagnosed in a timely manner			0
