-- here 's what we know about saturday 's crash landing of @entity4 and some of the key questions raised by those facts : 1			1
a preliminary readout from the flight data and cockpit voice recorders shows the aircraft was approaching well below the target landing speed of 137 knots ( 157 mph )			1
records from the flight data recorder show that at 500 feet of altitude and 34 seconds before impact , the aircraft had already slowed to 134 knots ( 154 mph )			1
at seven seconds before impact , the pilots attempted to spool up the engines			1
at four seconds , the stall warning sounded			0
at 1.5 seconds , the pilots tried to abort the landing and go around to attempt another landing			1
at impact , the flight data recorder shows the aircraft had a forward speed of a mere 106 knots ( 121 mph )			1
what we do n't know : why was the aircraft approaching so slowly ? did the pilot not realize he was short ? girls killed in crash were headed for camp 2			2
@entity32 said the pilot at the controls was making his first landing of a @entity36 at @entity37			1
while a pilot with more than 10,000 hours of experience , including many hours flying @entity36 747s , he had only 43 hours of flying time in a 777			1
what we do n't know : did pilot inexperience with the aircraft play a role ? why did the captain not speak up or take control ? 3			1
the @entity50 investigators have found nothing to corroborate online flight tracking records showing that @entity4 descended from cruising altitude much more steeply and rapidly than previous @entity32 flights on the same route			0
the @entity50 says it found no " abnormally steep descent data			0
part of the instrument landing system approach on @entity59 was not working on the day of the crash			2
it had been down for some time			2
flights were landing using visual flight rules			2
the flight data shows the autopilot was disengaged at 1,600 feet and the pilot then took manual control of the plane			1
what we do n't know : did the lack of ils force the pilot to make a @entity76 landing in an aircraft with which he was not fully familiar ? 5			1
the runway 's precision approach path indicator lights , showing correct flight approach altitudes , were working			0
what we do n't know : why did n't the pilot recognize he was too low for the approach and initiate a go - around earlier ? 6			2
based on the debris field and the video obtained by @entity0 , the aircraft appears to have struck the rock sea wall well before the start of the runway			0
there are some marks on the sea wall , consistent with an impact of some part of the plane			2
the debris field runs from the water , slightly right of the paved threshold and runway center , all the way to the stopped aircraft fuselage			0
the @entity50 says pieces of the rear of the aircraft are in the water near the seawall , visible at low tide			0
the @entity36 lost its tail section , including vertical and horizontal stabilizers , near the end of the paved threshold , just before the start of the runway			1
what we do n't know : is this an indication the tail of the aircraft detached after first impact ? 9			2
the right engine is detached from the wing and wedged against the right side of the fuselage			0
the left engine is a considerable distance forward of the fuselage in a grassy area to the right of @entity59			0
the @entity50 says both engines had high rotational damage , showing that they were powering at impact			1
most of the fire damage to the aircraft occurred after the @entity36 came to a stop on its belly			1
passengers described the cabin interior as heavily damaged , with overhead bins dropping and at least one life raft / escape slide inflating inside the aircraft , trapping a flight attendant , whom passengers helped free			2
the @entity50 says it will investigate the structural safety of the seats			0
the coroner says one of the two passengers killed appears to have been run over by an emergency vehicle , though the coroner had not yet determined the cause of death			1
@entity32 has identified the fatalities as @entity152 and @entity153 of @entity154 , both of whom were 16			0
audio recordings of air traffic control conversations show no sign that the pilot declared an emergency before the crash landing			1
emergency vehicles were dispatched afterward			0
the aircraft was built in 2006 and was purchased new by @entity32			0
the @entity50 was planning to interview the four pilots monday afternoon			0
key information from those interviews will be made public at tuesday 's briefing			0
first responders describe eerie , chaotic moments why so many people survived @entity0 's @entity172 and @entity173 contributed to this report .			0
