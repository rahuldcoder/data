@entity0 , @entity1 -- the head of a humanitarian aid group and a few of his colleagues survived 50 hours beneath the rubble of a hotel , with the help of a few things he keeps in his bag for his two young children			1
" we had one @entity14 and we did share that , " said @entity16 , president and ceo of @entity18			1
he also had a bit of gum			0
while the supplies helped , @entity16 said , " i think we made it because we talked to each other , we helped each other , and we had this hope that we would be rescued at some point			1
" two of his colleagues did not survive			2
@entity28 and five colleagues had been walking through the lobby of the @entity31 last tuesday when he saw one of the chandeliers swing			1
" and before it even made its way down , just everything crashed and collapsed on top of us , " he told @entity2 's " @entity38 " on monday			2
" immediately we were looking around talking to each other , trying to see if everyone was ok			0
unfortunately two of my colleagues were pinned down by rubble and were injured			1
so we did what we could to help ease their pain at that moment			0
" @entity16 had some over-the - counter pain medicine and gave it to them			1
i 'm alive ! messages from @entity1 " my biggest fear initially was that there was n't going to be enough air for the six of us , " he said			0
then , when it became clear there was enough air , " we started talking about what we need to do			0
and , you know , from the size of the earthquake , from what we heard and what we felt and how fast the building fell , we knew it was a big quake			1
" the next morning , they could hear sledgehammers pounding as rescuers were checking to see if there were survivors			1
the trapped group screamed and banged on the walls , and rescuers heard them			1
the rescuers asked how many there were ; @entity16 answered eight -- six in his group , and two other men trapped in an elevator shaft			1
" they said , ' are you well ? ' and we said , ' no , we 're hurt			0
' and that was it			0
then it really was n't until we were rescued , till 7 p.m. the next night , that actually somebody came			2
in fact , the second night was really dark for us			2
i think we were just -- we were just shattered that nobody came back and said anything to us			2
" the group used their cell phones to illuminate the space			0
@entity16 said only one of his colleagues could move , and she looked for air spaces and light			1
" every time we might have heard a voice or something like a saw or something , we would scream and yell , but there was no response , " @entity16 said			1
then , on thursday , came a voice			0
" we all started to scream and shout at the top of our lungs			0
and we heard a voice come back to us saying , you know , ' hello , we 're here			1
we 're going to rescue you			0
' " it took four hours to get the group out			0
rescuers had to cut through layers of concrete , pull the trapped people out by their feet and squeeze them through a hole in the concrete only about 2 feet wide			0
" i 'm just amazed that we actually survived , " said @entity16			1
he added that he is grieving for his two colleagues who died			1
while @entity16 is relieved to be reunited with his family in the @entity126 , his thoughts are with the people of @entity1			2
the whole time he and the others were down there , @entity16 said , " as much as we were praying for ourselves , we were also praying for the people of @entity1 and of @entity0			2
because we knew how bad this was going to be , just from the way the building fell , and the aftershocks , which were just tremendous			0
" @entity18 provides health care services and supplies in poor countries including @entity1			0
