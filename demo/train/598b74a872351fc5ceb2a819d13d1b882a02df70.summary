-- ambassador to the @entity3 @entity2 , a possible nominee to be the next secretary of state , came to @entity5 tuesday to perform a private mea culpa to key @entity8 senators for her erroneous initial public statements about the perpetrators of the attack on the @entity13 consulate in @entity14 in september in which four @entity13 were killed			1
after tuesday 's meeting with @entity18 , sen. @entity16 said , " it is clear that the information that she gave the @entity13 people was incorrect when she said that it was a spontaneous demonstration triggered by a hateful video			2
" sen. @entity24 who also met with @entity18 observed , " bottom line : i 'm more disturbed now than i was before			0
" what is the @entity8 theory of the case against @entity18 ? it appears to boil down to the idea that leading @entity31 covered up the involvement of terrorists in some way connected to @entity35 in the @entity14 attack during the run - up to the close presidential election because president @entity39 and others in his administration had for some time said that @entity35 was close to strategic defeat			1
news : @entity18 fails to subdue @entity8 ' criticism over @entity47 attack does this case make sense ? first , you would have to accept that @entity39 , @entity18 and secretary of state @entity51 all knowingly deceived the @entity13 public about what had happened at the @entity14 consulate			1
when this notion was raised in october during the second presidential debate , @entity39 scolded @entity8 challenger @entity57 saying , " the suggestion that anybody in my team , whether the secretary of state , our @entity3 ambassador -- anybody on my team -- would play politics or mislead when we 've lost four of our own , governor , is offensive			2
" according to a @entity0 poll released tuesday most @entity13 agree with the president and do not believe that anyone in his administration intentionally tried to mislead them about what happened in @entity14			0
second , it was the intelligence community , not officials at the @entity75 or @entity76 , that eliminated from the talking points used by @entity18 after the @entity14 attack the suspected involvement of the @entity47 jihadist group , @entity80			1
according to accounts of former @entity84 director @entity83 ' closed door testimony about @entity14 to congressional intelligence committees earlier this month , the intelligence community eliminated references to @entity80 in the talking points so as not to tip off members of the terrorist group that the @entity84 believed that they were responsible for the attack			1
@entity91 : @entity18 ' certainly ' misled on @entity14 , but unsure of motive the conspiracy therefore was not to mislead the @entity13 public but to mislead @entity13 's enemies			1
if @entity18 had gone beyond her unclassified talking points and said that @entity80 was suspected to be behind the @entity14 attacks , no doubt she would now be being hounded for the unauthorized disclosure of classified information			2
third , it is worth recalling that whenever there is a news event in a chaotic country on the other side of the world , first accounts about the event are often wrong			0
remember the erroneous reports about another big news event last year ; the death of @entity113			0
initially , it was portrayed by the @entity39 administration that @entity113 had died during a firefight with @entity13 forces in @entity118 and had used his wife as a human shield			1
as more accurate information subsequently came in from the field , administration officials clarified that @entity113 put up no resistance and had not used his wife as a shield			0
this is not conspiracy ; this is the fog of war			0
it is also worth recalling that the situation in @entity14 was so chaotic and dangerous that it took three weeks for the @entity132 to get in to the city to investigate what had happened at the consulate			0
and it took even more time for the facts to emerge that the @entity14 mission was n't really a consulate in any conventional sense , but was more of a @entity84 listening station and that two of the four @entity13 who had died in the attack were n't diplomats as initially portrayed but were , in fact , @entity84 contractors			2
opinion : why attacks on @entity18 are misguided the fact that @entity8 have pressed to learn more about the security arrangements at the consulate and security in @entity14 overall as well as the details of what happened the night of the attack has ended up bringing to light much useful information			1
but none of that information has changed the basic fact that a tragedy occurred at @entity14 , not a cover up			0
@entity163 : why we need answers on @entity14 stepping back from the whole debate about how @entity18 came to make inaccurate public statements about @entity14 , there is another premise of the @entity8 attacks upon her that deserves considerable skepticism			1
we are supposed to believe that because @entity80 -- a group inspired by @entity35 's ideas , but having no links to the terrorist group that attacked the @entity13 on 9/11 -- was able to pull off a deadly attack in a @entity179 country ravaged by a recent war against a lightly defended @entity13 mission , killing four , that @entity35 is suddenly an important threat again to the @entity13			0
if you buy that , i have a bridge in @entity14 i 'd like to sell you .			0

@entity188 : @entity2 's trip to @entity5 was n't a *success* , senators said
he says the @entity8 continues to bash @entity18 for her mistaken explanation for @entity14 attack
@entity188 says the argument that @entity39 administration deliberately lied does n't hold up
the intelligence community *decided* not to initially *reveal* truth about attack , he says
