-- the march music stops and the camera screens come to life as 70 small black cannons fire a shower of golden confetti high above the crowds			2
tumbling through the air , the shiny plume swirls in a fleeting dance , covering the ground in a sprawling blanket of gold stars			2
it was with this rain of 54,000 star - shaped gold confetti , part of his " celebration " installation , that @entity22 artist @entity21 chose to mark the opening of the 11th edition of the @entity25 of @entity26 ( @entity27 ) on may 10			1
the month - long event is @entity30 's major contemporary art stage			1
its main exhibition , housed on an industrial wasteland on the southeastern edge of the bustling @entity36 capital , has brought together 61 well - established and emerging artists from all across the continent and the @entity30 diaspora			1
across three old warehouses , a diverse array of paintings , sculptures , videos , installations and mixed - media work leads audiences into an immersive journey of forms and ideas that seek to go beyond aesthetics			2
" we are in an era where art should speak for something , " says @entity52 , one of the @entity25 's three curators			1
" there 's a crisis in @entity61 for example with @entity63 -- you expect artists to respond to that because artists act as seers of society , " he adds			2
" [ to ] engage with the real issues of our time , like inequality or social conditions , without the work losing the sublime quality that makes art art -- it 's very important			0
" true , shortcomings such as last - minute schedule changes and repairs , as well as missing work ( the area supposed to host the etching prints of @entity84 , the world - renowned @entity85 artist and one of @entity27 's biggest names , was left glaringly empty at the time of the opening ) took some shine off this year 's opening event , but also added a real sense of adventure			0
yet , this is still a powerful showcase , with several highlights reaffirming the renewed energy of @entity30 's contemporary artists and their growing relevance in the global stage			1
compelling creations one of them is " @entity105 , " a captivating video installation by @entity104			0
in a small darkened room , the @entity107 artist uses a @entity110 - like creature that obsessively devours everything around her to paint a grim picture of today 's mass consumerism			0
likewise , @entity114 deploys giant anthropomorphic gas canisters in " indignation " to denounce issues like fundamentalism , racism and corruption and to call for resistance			0
in " @entity124 , " @entity123 @entity122 invites visitors to interact with three crystal bowls filled with water to produce hypnotizing sounds and eerie light reflections			0
this is a crowd - pleaser , just like the intriguing work by @entity107 - based @entity132 , who playfully mixes real and imaginary @entity134 logos to question the role and motivations of charity groups			0
similarly , @entity138 imagines an @entity30 ngo that gives grants to @entity141 countries in a series of manipulated images that challenge assumptions over international aid			1
all the exhibited work has been brought together under the central theme of " producing the @entity148 , " an ambitious attempt to showcase art that engages with the real issues of today			0
or , as the biennial 's three curators -- @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 -- put it , " to connect politics and aesthetics in a vigorous and sustained way			0
" a more tangible link , however , is that all participating artists are exhibiting in @entity163 for the first time			1
" the real value of @entity27 is that it serves as a platform of visibility for @entity30 artists , so it makes no sense if you keep on repeating the same set of people over the different iterations , " says @entity154			1
" in a way , with this edition we are set to reposition @entity27 going forward			0
" new faces one of these newcomers is @entity179 , a @entity180 artist exploring the representation of cultural minorities in popular media			0
here , she uses comic book illustrations to challenge the stereotypical portrayal of women in contemporary graphic novels , as well as the absence of female black superheroes in the genre			2
" my protagonist in this particular comic is female , black , young and gay , " says @entity179 , introducing " @entity191 , " an undercover agent operating in a not - too - distant future , where the whole world is controlled by a powerful corporation			0
" the idea is to help different people to relate to different symbolisms , " says @entity179			0
" a lot of the heroes in popular media , whether they are comics , movies or novels , are heterosexual white males -- nothing wrong with that but i think we need to see another alternative , " she adds			0
" you know , the world is made out of so many people			0
" like other art festivals , @entity216 gives out awards to participating artists			2
haimbe herself was one of the 10 winners , scooping the " @entity222			0
" the grand prize was shared by @entity22 artist @entity224 , for his " @entity234 " painting , and @entity61 @entity226 , for his " @entity233 " sculpture , a compelling creation made of repurposed nails and spoons in @entity232 's junkyards			0
" the sunflower comprises of several small flowers and when they come together they glow under the sun , " says @entity226			0
" so i 'm trying to look at the positive signs of the interdependence of @entity30 ... because the interpretation of @entity30 is such that it 's conflict and famine			1
" @entity245 history @entity246 first appeared in the calendars of art aficionados in the early 1990s , initially as an event dedicated to literature and then as a biennial of visual arts that welcomed artists from all over the world			2
by 1996 , however , at a time when few young @entity30 artists were able to break into the international market , @entity27 had already found a new focus as a pan-african contemporary art biennial			1
the transformation helped it distinguish itself from other large - scale recurring exhibitions but also connected it to a longer history of 20th century black consciousness , where @entity36 played a leading role -- it 's hard to start talking today about @entity27 without the name of @entity268 , @entity36 's first president , popping up			2
a poet , writer and an avid art collector himself , @entity268 famously staged the first @entity272 in @entity163 in 1966 , bringing together artists , dancers , writers and musicians from all over @entity30 , @entity277 , @entity278 and the @entity279			1
today , as more and more @entity30 artists are finally making a name outside the continent , @entity27 has become the main platform for @entity30 and its diaspora to engage with the international market , attracting the usual crowds of artists , curators , critics and art historians			1
similar to previous editions , this year 's biennial does n't start and end with its five main events			2
even though the local public here seems to be largely unaware of them , there are some 200 parallel exhibitions running simultaneously across and outside @entity163 , giving the opportunity to 500 artists to showcase their work in a wide array of spaces ranging from art galleries and hotel lobbies to bookstores and restaurants			1
back in the main exhibition , curator @entity156 walks past the massive installations dotting the outdoor space , stopping every now and then to hug and talk to artists crossing his path			1
he says part of @entity27 's goals this year were to help launch the careers of unknown artists and also help deal with the absence of an active market for contemporary art in the continent			1
" there 's just one problem with the @entity30 art in the continent : there are no local markets for this kind of art , " he says			1
" there are not that many institutions who help , " he adds			0
" artists need to go to @entity277 or @entity278 to find someone who can buy the work and help and do the exhibitions , " continues @entity156			2
" i know that what we are doing here is going to open this way to make all the people in @entity30 understand that			1
" the @entity25 runs until june 8 .			1

the 11th @entity25 is currently underway
its main exhibition *features* 61 contemporary artists from @entity30 and the diaspora
audiences can also visit 200 parallel exhibitions spread throughout @entity163 and beyond
the @entity25 will remain open until june 8
