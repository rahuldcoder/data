@entity0 -- president @entity2 called wednesday for a series of steps to help @entity5 conserve and get in touch with nature , including full funding of the $ 900 million @entity9 for only the third time in its existence			1
at a @entity13 event , @entity2 also proposed creating a @entity14 to help young people find work in the outdoors , and extending the tax deduction for donating private land for conservation			1
the proposals are part of an action plan by the @entity24 , which @entity2 launched last year to promote community conservation efforts to protect the nation 's natural heritage and help people experience it			2
" these are the right steps to take for our environment , but they 're also the right steps to take for our country , " @entity2 said , citing job creation and economic growth , scientific research and helping @entity5 kids experience nature			0

" to encourage young people to put down the remote and video games and go outside , we 're going to establish a new @entity14 so they can build a lifelong relationship with their national heritage , " @entity2 said to more applause			1
