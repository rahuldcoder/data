-- when @entity2 went to @entity3 for his grandmother 's funeral , he had another dead person on his mind -- the cadaver he was dissecting in his anatomy class			0
the @entity11 medical student kept dreaming about who this dead man might have been when he was alive			0
" it was at the funeral that i learned that one of my uncles had the ability to see ghosts , " said @entity2 , sharing his story at @entity15 , a monthly oral storytelling event in @entity17			1
" during the entire funeral , my uncle 's there giving a play by play of what my grandmother 's doing in spirit form , " telling guests that she was happy they were present			0
after the funeral , the uncle listened to @entity2 's dreams and suggested a diagnosis of " spirit attachment " and treatment for the body 's restless spirit			0
as @entity2 led up to the last day of his anatomy class three years ago , @entity15 's standing room only crowd waited on pins and needles to hear if he applied his uncle 's treatment to the body			1
@entity17 residents @entity49 and @entity51 started @entity15 more than a year ago as a local chapter of the @entity53 , a @entity55 - based oral storytelling group with a growing number of programs around the country ( and a few in other countries )			1
the @entity17 group , which broke away from the @entity53 and held its first independent event last month , is one of a growing number of oral storytelling groups across the country telling true stories before a live audience			1
many people in the audience usually make up the potential list of storytellers for the night			1
veteran @entity15 storyteller @entity73 , a retired @entity74 employee , shared the tale of a hawk that kept vigil with mourners after his brother 's funeral			1
only after hawks continued to visit him did he mention it to his sister - in - law , who told him that his brother loved hawks and would stop the car to watch them anytime he spotted them			0
@entity17 advertising executive @entity89 , a first - timer at the event but a teller of stories within his family , held the audience captive with a tale of an enormous , attacking snapping turtle that took over a fishing trip from his childhood			1
" it was prehistoric , i tell you , it was prehistoric ! " he shouted to laughter from the audience			2
" there 's no other type of performance really where the audience becomes the performer and becomes the audience again , " @entity49 said			2
" there 's the intimacy of telling a story without any notes			1
you 're singing your own song and telling your own story			2
you 're getting up there and finding your way in front of the audience 's eyes			2
" carapace rules are simple : put your name in the hat and you might get picked , tell a personal story , keep it to five minutes , no notes , no political rants , no poetry , no grudges , no propaganda			1
have a beginning , middle and end			0
know the last line of your story			2
check out @entity15 's @entity141 page for the complete set of rules			1
author @entity144 gets a lot of credit for the recent growth in oral storytelling as performance			1
@entity144 founded the @entity53 in 1997 in his @entity55 loft , inspired by nights with friends drinking @entity153 , playing poker and telling stories at his friend @entity156 's home on @entity158 in @entity159			1
the group was named after the moths that would sneak through the rotten porch screens , drawn to the lights			2
" storytelling seems to be in our dna , " said @entity144 , author of " @entity165 , " " @entity166 " and " @entity167			2
" " stories are the ways in which we can impart dense clusters of information glued together by emotion			2
it 's really how we learn about the world in a way we can grasp and remember			0
" @entity53 has grown into a nonprofit with professional staff that runs storytelling events and competitions in @entity55 , @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185 ( with more cities to come ) as well as storytelling training for corporations and high schools and community centers in underserved neighborhoods			1
there is also a @entity194 - award winning @entity195 on public radio			0
oral historian @entity197 says oral storytelling speaks to our identity as human beings , and he is n't surprised at the recent popularity of true stories told live			1
" before technology , storytelling was how you knew what was meaningful , how you had any deep understanding of who you were and what your place was in the world , " said @entity197 , a history professor and director of @entity205 's @entity204			2
" it was the way those ideas were communicated to us			0
that same thread is in these stories , the unscripted nature of it , the reality of it , the rawness of it			2
something significant and very deep is conveyed through the relating of experience			0
" those stories attract large crowds to @entity53 's flagship mainstage programs in @entity55 and elsewhere			1
the @entity53 staff chooses a theme and invites five people from all walks of life -- some known and some not known to the audience -- to tell 10 - minute first person stories on stage , said @entity53 artistic director @entity238			1
although the stories are n't strictly memorized , the artistic staff helps the storyteller to frame stories so they know where they 're going with their tales			0
" it takes an enormous amount of work but that 's what we 're dedicating to doing , " @entity246 said			0
as the @entity53 has grown and partnered with interested storytellers to launch " @entity255 " affiliates in various cities around the country , a few local groups have chafed against rules more recently required by the national organization			0
@entity53 intended @entity255 affiliates to help create @entity260 , which are the @entity53 's storytelling competitions , in those cities			1
the local groups in @entity17 and @entity264 have created communities of storytellers who have found a family , where a laugh or nod tells the teller that he has connected with the audience			0
the members were n't as interested in competition			0
founders of both groups found they were violating other moth rules : they had too many people attending to fit into a living room ( a location requirement ) and neither wanted to charge admission			1
@entity17 did n't want to have judging			0
@entity264 gave preference to first - time storytellers			0
" we open the stage to anyone who wants to tell a story and we try to fit in as many stories as we can , " said @entity285 , a founder of the @entity264 group , now named the @entity287			1
both sides describe the parting as amicable			0
" we underestimated what the demand would be , which is a luxury problem to have , " @entity246 said			0
the @entity17 and @entity264 groups " got to a size that was n't what the program was supposed to be			0
we did n't want to hold them back but we were n't ready to launch a slam there			0
we hope we 'll do more in those cities eventually			0
" back at @entity305 in @entity17 , where @entity15 holds its free monthly get - togethers , any storyteller who did n't get picked to speak was invited to come up on stage at the end of the evening to share their first , last or best line			1
@entity15 's @entity49 says it tends to be a popular part of the program , and that june night is no different			2
@entity17 resident @entity314 , who was raised in the oral storytelling tradition in @entity316 , has the crowd wanting more with her single line : " and that , my friends , is how @entity321 kept me a virgin			1

@entity15 is an oral storytelling group that has people tell true stories before an audience
rules : tell a personal story , keep it to five minutes , no notes , no political rants , no poetry
the moth runs storytelling competitions in @entity55 , @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185
