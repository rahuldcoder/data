@entity1 's unbeaten run under new coach @entity2 came to an unexpected halt on wednesday as the @entity5 side failed to clinch a place in the knockout stage of the @entity8 after losing 2 - 1 at @entity9			1
@entity11 's late goal , his 74th of 2012 , proved a mere consolation as the @entity14 champions celebrated a famous victory to mark 125 years of existence			2
the result left @entity1 still on top of @entity19 , while @entity9 's hopes of reaching the last 16 were greatly improved as a first - half goal from @entity22 and an 83rd - minute strike from teenage substitute @entity24 put @entity26 's team in second place with two games left			1
@entity29 dropped to the bottom of the group after losing 2 - 0 at @entity32 , with @entity33 scoring both second - half goals for the @entity36 team			2
the @entity38 striker then missed a penalty , hitting the crossbar after @entity42 defender @entity41 was sent off			0
@entity1 traveled to @entity43 as the only team from @entity46 's top leagues still unbeaten this season following weekend defeats for @entity48 and @entity49 , but went behind in the 21st minute when @entity50 midfielder @entity22 headed in @entity52 's corner			2
the 18 - year - old @entity24 , making his first appearance in @entity46 's top club competition , made it 2 - 0 after veteran midfielder @entity56 failed to cut out a long clearance by @entity9 keeper @entity59			1
@entity11 netted at the start of injury time after an initial block by @entity59 but @entity1 could not repeat the last - gasp heroics of @entity9 's visit to the @entity65 last month , when @entity2 's team snatched a 2 - 1 victory			1
it was one of the biggest results in @entity9 's history , behind winning the @entity8 in 1967 and losing in the final three years later			1
" it 's right up there , one of the proudest nights in my career , " @entity26 told reporters			0
" it was a monumental effort from all those players and on the anniversary of club , it 's a very special occasion			0
" i wanted them to do themselves justice and they 've even surpassed that , they 've beaten the best club in the world			0
" you try to weather the storm , you know it 's coming and there 's not a lot you can do			0
then young @entity24 comes on , gives us new lease of life and scores a great second goal , and he 'll go down in history now			0
" another unbeaten run came to an end as @entity1 's conquerors in last season 's final , @entity105 , boosted hopes of reaching the last 16 after stealing a 3 - 2 win at home to @entity109 in the fourth minute of injury time			1
substitute @entity111 headed in @entity113 's corner to avenge last month 's 2 - 1 defeat away to the @entity116 league leaders , who paid for defensive lapses at @entity119			1
the @entity121 team took the lead in the sixth minute when @entity124 striker @entity123 charged down an attempted clearance by goalkeeper @entity126 following a poor backpass by @entity128			0
longtime @entity105 target @entity129 leveled in the ninth minute but fellow @entity133 midfielder @entity131 gave the home team the halftime advantage with a superb long - range volley after pyatov - racing out of his area -- headed a clearance straight into his path			2
@entity129 equalized again straight after the break with an almost carbon copy of his first goal , this time with his left foot , but @entity105 hit back again as @entity145 had a goal ruled out for offside and then 21 - year - old @entity148 forward @entity111 followed up his goal in saturday 's @entity150 draw with @entity151			1
it left @entity109 on top of @entity154 on goal difference from @entity105 , with @entity48 a point adrift in third following a 4 - 0 win at home to @entity159			1
the @entity161 champions ended a run of nine successive draws in @entity164 competition as @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 scored in the first half , while second - half substitute @entity169 headed the other against the @entity172 league winners			0
@entity173 ensured there would be no repeat of last season 's embarrassment by booking a place in the last 16 with two matches to spare after a 3 - 1 win at @entity36 club @entity181			1
@entity173 failed to qualify from a group including @entity32 , @entity183 and @entity184 as manager @entity185 paid the price for resting his big names , but this time there has been no mistake with four wins from four in @entity191 @entity181 led through @entity193 's early penalty , but substitute @entity194 leveled before @entity195 scored a penalty and a third forward , @entity198 , bundled in another as @entity173 matched the late comeback in the 3 - 2 win at @entity202 two weeks ago			1
@entity181 dropped to the bottom of the group after @entity204 joined @entity205 on four points with a 3 - 1 win in @entity208			2
@entity210 striker @entity209 scored a hat - trick to earn his club 's first win of the @entity164 campaign			0
@entity215 moved top of @entity191 with a 6 - 1 hammering of @entity218 that ended the @entity221 club 's hopes of qualification			2
@entity224 striker @entity223 scored a 16 - minute first - half hat - trick as the @entity226 went above @entity227 on goal difference , with @entity229 , @entity230 and substitute @entity231 adding the others			0
@entity227 moved up to second place with a 4 - 2 win at home to @entity236 , having led 3 - 0 after 51 minutes with goals from @entity238 , @entity239 -- who netted a penalty -- and @entity242			0
@entity243 and @entity244 replied but @entity242 's second in the 86th - minute condemned the @entity247 champions to a second successive defeat .			0

last season 's @entity8 finalists @entity1 lose for first time in 2012 - 13
@entity5 side could have qualified for last 16 but went down 2 - 1 away to @entity9
champions @entity105 snatch injury - time win at home to @entity109
@entity173 through to knockout stage after fourth successive victory
