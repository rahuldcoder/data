" this was just an effort to cover up this bad shooting , " attorney @entity44 said			1
family of man killed sues police , @entity2 tense interrogation in the interrogation video , which was first posted on @entity55 's website on sunday , a police detective repeatedly presses @entity8 's tearful girlfriend , asking her where @entity8 got the gun he had in the store			1
" you understand that we 're investigating a serious incident , " detective @entity59 says			2
" you lie to me and you might be on your way to jail			0
" " i swear to @entity68 , on my job , my family , on everything i love , " @entity65 replies , telling the detective repeatedly that she never saw @entity8 with a weapon and that she 'll take a polygraph test to prove it			1
as she cries , the detective appears unconvinced			2
" why would he have a gun in the store ? " he asks			0
" i do n't know , " she replies			0
" did he carry a gun ? " the detective continues			2
" not that i. ... i 've never known him to have a gun , " she says			0
her response appears to upset the detective			0
" do n't tell me , ' not that you know , ' because that 's the first thing that i realize that somebody 's not telling me the truth , when they say that kind of stuff , " @entity59 says			0
at one point in the video , @entity89 sobs as she buries her head in her hands			0
the detective says he 'll write down her testimony but then asks whether she 's under the influence of drugs or alcohol			2
" your eyes are kind of messed up looking and you seem a little lethargic at times , " he says , " and i do n't know if it 's because you 're upset or not			0
i just want to make sure what 's going on			0
" it 's not until the end of the 90 - minute interrogation that @entity89 learns her boyfriend has died			0

@entity89 sinks back in her chair and puts her hands on her head			0
" i do n't know any other way to tell you , " @entity59 says			0
" what happened there was n't a good thing and as a result of his actions , he is gone			0
" detective : ' i was very direct in my questions ' police have not responded to several requests from @entity7 for comment on the video			1
in a statement officials released in september , @entity59 describes his questioning of @entity89 at the police department			2
" the initial information i had was that ( @entity8 ) may have brought a gun into the store with him			2
so i was very direct in my questions that i was having problems believing she would have not seen him bring a gun into the store , " he wrote			0
" she became emotional during the interview and started crying , saying that she is not lying , she will take a lie detector test and do whatever she needs to do			0
" in his report , @entity59 wrote that it was only later when he was at the @entity2 that he learned where the gun came from			2
" i also learned while on scene that the rifle involved was a pellet gun that was taken from a box while he was inside the store , " he wrote			0
" this would also agree with the statement that she made that he did not take any type of firearm out of her car into the store with him			0
" attorney : interrogation shows police ' tried to cover it up ' @entity44 on tuesday said his legal team filed a federal civil lawsuit against two police officers ; @entity24 's police chief ; the city of @entity24 and its police department ; and @entity2			1
the @entity8 family is seeking at least $ 75,000 in compensatory damages and an unstated amount for punitive damages , the suit said			2
the family alleges , among other things , that the police officers did not do due diligence to determine that @entity44 was n't a threat ; that the officers did n't give him enough time to put down the weapon ; and that @entity2 was negligent because the air rifle had been resting on a shelf , unpackaged , for at least two days , the family 's lawyers said tuesday			1
@entity44 said police knew @entity8 did n't have a firearm when he walked into the @entity2			1
" he was not an imminent threat to anyone			0
he was just shopping , " he said			0
after the grand jury decided in september not to indict the police officers who were involved in the shooting , prosecutor @entity189 said a " perfect storm of circumstances " led to @entity8 's death and noted that the air gun bore a strong resemblance to an actual automatic weapon			1
" it is very hard to tell the difference , " @entity189 said			0
police responded to the scene after a witness called 911 and told dispatchers that @entity8 was walking around with a rifle and " waving it back and forth			1
" according to police , when officers arrived , @entity8 did not comply with their commands to drop his weapon			1
and the @entity8 family 's lawyers say police did n't give him enough time to put down the weapon			1
but @entity44 said that because @entity8 was black , police made assumptions			2
" the officers ran into an aisle , saw a black man with what they perceived to be a gun , and shot him on sight , " he said			0
the interrogation video , he said , shows how police handled the case from day one			1
" they , in their mind , had it made up that mr. @entity8 was a criminal , and they proceeded based on that without doing anything to independently corroborate what was actually happening in the store , " he said			2
" and they tried to cover it up by interrogating miss @entity65 in such a manner to try to get her to make a statement that would justify them shooting and killing mr. @entity8 that evening			1
" opinion : killing of @entity8 -- injustice for all			2
