-- @entity1 says she 's sorry for the media storm that erupted after she recounted that she was the victim of racism in a posh @entity5 boutique			1
@entity1 's revelation last week on @entity7 led to the upscale store being identified as @entity9 in @entity10 and its staff was immediately caught up in a frenzy of media interest			1
the manager of the boutique , @entity17 , subsequently told @entity0 the entire incident was a " 200 percent misunderstanding " and had nothing to do with racism			2
speaking at the @entity23 premiere of @entity25 ' " @entity24 , " monday , @entity1 said the situation had been blown out of proportion			1
" i think that incident in @entity5 was just an incident in @entity5			1
i 'm really sorry that it got blown up , " she said			0
" i purposely did not mention the name of the store			2
i 'm sorry that i said it was @entity5			1
" i was just referencing it as an example of being in a place where people do n't expect that you would be able to be there			0
" ' no apology needed ' on @entity7 , @entity1 recounted how she had asked to see a $ 38,000 handbag , but the shop assistant refused to show it to her because it was " too expensive			1
" @entity1 explained monday that for her , racism is not usually overt			1
" nobody is going to come and call me the n - word to my face , unless they are a thug on @entity50 or @entity51 , " she said			0
" it shows up for me differently , it shows up ( when ) i 'm in a store and the person does n't obviously know that i carry the ' black card ' and so they make an assessment based upon the way i look and who i am			1
" it appears @entity1 is referring to the exclusive @entity62 centurion card , which is issued by invitation only to an exclusive group of the rich and famous			2
@entity1 said she was dressed in a @entity66 skirt and top but was not wearing obvious symbols of wealth such as diamond jewelry or designer shoes			2
" you should be able to go into a store looking like whatever you look like and say ' i would like to see this ' -- and that did n't happen , " she said			2
has something like this happened to you ? but while she stood by it as an example , @entity1 cautioned against reading too much into the specific incident			2
and she rejected any idea that @entity5 should be asked to apologize to her			2
" it 's not an indictment against the country or even that store , " she said			1
" it was just , you know , one person who did n't want to offer me the opportunity to see the bag			0
so no apology necessary from the country , from @entity5 ! " in her latest film , @entity1 plays the wife of the main character -- portrayed by @entity95 -- who serves as a butler in the @entity98			1
@entity1 's claim ' absurd , ' clerk says meanwhile , the store clerk concerned told @entity5 daily newspaper @entity102 , in an interview printed sunday , that she felt " terrible " and had not been able to sleep for days			1
the woman , who gave her name as @entity106 because she said she did n't want to be hassled on the street , said , " i feel as if i 'm in the middle of a whirlwind			0
totally powerless , as if everything 's been taken from me			0
it 's a horror , what 's happened			0
" @entity106 , from @entity113 , said she had asked her manager if she should resign , but that @entity17 had stood by her			0
asked to give her version of the incident , @entity106 said @entity1 had come into the store and was looking at bags when her eye was caught by a $ 38,000 crocodile skin number by @entity121			1
she told the newspaper , " i explained that this was exactly the same bag as the one i had in my hand			0
i would happily show her other bags , i said			0
" @entity106 said @entity1 's claim that she told the media mogul the bag was too expensive for her was absolutely not true			1
i would never say such a thing to a customer			0
good manners and politeness are everything in this shop , " she said			0
the store assistant added that she had n't recognized @entity139 but that it would not have made a difference in any case			1
" we make a huge effort to treat everyone with the same respect and in the same way , " she said			0
@entity0 's @entity148 contributed to this report .			0
