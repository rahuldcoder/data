@entity0 has been showcasing his talents as " @entity2 " since 2004 , teaching dog owners how to train their energetic and oftentimes misbehaving canines			1
@entity0 gained celebrity status after helping stars such as @entity7 with their precious pooches , but on his @entity10 series " @entity2 , " he works with everyday people			1
recently in @entity12 , @entity0 shared his tips for adopting a shelter dog with @entity15 and @entity16 , a married couple who recently decided they are ready to adopt a dog			1
@entity0 strongly supports adopting pets , but he warns that taking in a shelter dog based on pity is n't in the best interest of the dog			1
many people choose a dog based on emotion , but @entity0 recommends a different approach			1
" i always suggest to people to be logical with the adoption because you get to understand compatibility and what energy are you bringing home , " he said			2
" it 's hard because most of the time people do impulse adoptions , but unfortunately those dogs are brought back more often than kept at home			1
" he said compatibility starts with understanding a dog 's body language , beginning with the eyes			1
" it 's the softness of the eye contact that can tell you a lot [ because ] they can tell you sadness , as much as it can tell you , ' i 'm open for a relationship			2
' or they can tell you , ' i do n't want to be with you , ' " he explained			0
" through the eye contact you can know exactly how they feel about your presence			0
" @entity0 accompanied the @entity52 as they checked out the homeless dogs at @entity54 in @entity12			1
@entity16 recounted how @entity0 helped explain to the couple how they should go about choosing their future pet			2
" there were pictures on the cages of the dogs and he would cover the bottom of the face and he said , ' just look at the eyes , ' " @entity16 said			2
" you could tell immediately [ from the eyes ] that this dog was sad , extra hyper , or calm and sweet			2
" @entity0 said many future pet owners often mistake a high - powered tail wag as happiness			2
" that does n't mean the dog is happy , that means the dog is excited ! " he explained			0
if you are considering adopting a dog , @entity0 said you must first assess your own energy level , then look for a dog that matches it			1
when a dog 's energy level is higher than the owner 's energy level , it can lead to problems			1
" that 's when you see people , when they go for a walk , they 're being pulled by their dog , or when they open the door , just to answer the doorbell , the dog gets to the door first , " he explained			1
next , he said future dog owners need to consider how they will set boundaries and limitations for their pet			0
the @entity98 , who described their energy level as medium , found a small lab mix at the @entity104 shelter that they liked			0
after observing them together , @entity0 said he believed she was a compatible dog for the couple			1
the couple later noticed the dog shedding quite a bit , so , because @entity113 has allergies , they decided to continue their search using the advice @entity0 has shared			1
that , according to @entity0 was the right decision			2
" my goal was to teach them a little bit more than what they knew , " @entity0 said			2
" and what they adopt today was knowledge , maybe not a dog yet , but when they adopt a dog , it will be the right dog for them because they will do it with knowledge			2
" @entity0 said after you have adopted a shelter dog , the first thing you need to do before bringing your new pet home is take it for a long , one - to two - hour walk			1
" it 's like his vacation			0
it 's almost like you 're really welcoming him by removing physical energy , " @entity0 said			1
" then you bring him home			0
immediately , before you give affection , you tell a dog where he 's going to sleep or stay			2
you begin practicing separation so you do n't have separation anxiety in the future			0
" @entity0 said the hardest thing for a dog to learn is how to be away from its family			1
" we go to work , kids go to school , at one point he will be by himself , " he explained			0
" so , it 's best to introduce him to how his life is going to look like in the future from day one			0
so you do n't catch him by surprise			0
" understanding dog behavior is key to creating a lasting relationship with a dog , @entity0 said			1
" follow through with exercise and discipline , " he said			0
" everybody wants to pet a dog , but not everybody walks the dog and is consistent with rules , boundaries and limitations			0
we do n't have a problem with breed , with pit bulls , we do n't have a problem with aggression , we have a problem with education			0
" several weeks after their shelter visit , the @entity52 saw a dog available on @entity183			0
they were drawn to his cute looks and his big ears , but they reminded themselves of @entity0 's tips			1
" we kept saying to each other , we ca n't get him just because he 's cute , " @entity188 said			0
they found the dog at @entity192 , which has a " spend the night " program			0
they were allowed to bring the dog home for a night , which sealed the deal			0
" we were really surprised because at the shelter he was really hyperactive , " @entity16 said			0
" we got him home and he was really chill			0
" the @entity52 credit @entity0 's advice for leading them to the right dog , which they named " beans			1

@entity0 is known as the " dog *whisperer* " for his ability to train troubled dogs
he hosts the show , " @entity2 " on @entity10
@entity0 says compatibility starts with understanding a dog 's body language
@entity0 warns that people should not chose a dog to adopt only based on emotions , like pity
