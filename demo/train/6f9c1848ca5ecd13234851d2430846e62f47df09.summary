-- a fast - moving storm system struck parts of the @entity3 hard on wednesday evening , delivering blows to @entity5 and many other communities before moving quickly to inflict damage farther east			1
the @entity11 itself experienced gusts that measured about 50 mph around 6 p.m. ( 7 p.m. et ) , in addition to dime - size hail , the @entity10 's @entity5 branch said			1
cities and towns near @entity5 were affected as well			2
about 50 miles southwest , in @entity19 , residents were urged to hunker down after storm spotters " reported wall clouds " that suggest a possible tornado , according to weather service			2
in @entity25 , some 60 miles west of @entity5 , straight - line winds downed power lines , and some large trees appeared to be damaged , chief deputy @entity28 of the country sheriff 's department said			1
to the east in @entity33 , @entity34 , a severe thunderstorm warning advised residents to brace for 80 mph wind gusts and pingpong - ball - size hail			1
some 35 miles south near @entity39 , @entity40 , radar showed winds were blowing up to 80 mph			2
all this commotion was thanks to a swift and , at times , powerful storm system that moved across the @entity3 and into the @entity47 on wednesday evening			0
one of the first indications that it would be tumultuous day came around 4:30 p.m. , when a " confirmed tornado " touched down about 8 miles east of @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity52			2
several businesses and one home in @entity50 were destroyed , while three other homes suffered significant damage , said @entity52 emergency management spokeswoman @entity58			0
thankfully , there were no reports of fatalities or injuries			0
the storm 's impact was n't unexpected : the @entity65 had warned that @entity34 , @entity47 and much of @entity40 , including the city of @entity5 , faced a " high risk " -- the most perilous category -- of severe weather through wednesday night			1
the portion of the @entity71 under a moderate risk for severe weather extended farther and included the cities of @entity74 , @entity52 ; @entity75 , @entity34 ; and @entity76 , @entity47			1
the threat of tornadoes was particularly high in southwest @entity79 and northwest @entity40 , thanks to severe thunderstorms capable of producing a twister			0
there was a possibility they could strike well beyond that , though , with the weather service issuing tornado watches through midnight wednesday for much of @entity47 , southwestern @entity89 and northern @entity90			1
@entity91 , director of the @entity65 , explained that the type of severe weather that hit the @entity3 was a derecho			1
derived from the @entity96 word for " straight ahead , " derechos are a weather phenomenon that traditionally happens only a few times a year			0
it is defined as a line of storms that produces a swath of damage more than 240 miles long with gusts of at least 58 mph			0
a derecho forms thanks in large part to warm , humid air , instability in the atmosphere and jet - stream winds , which can organize the storms into isolated storms called super cells			0
those super cells rotate among themselves , then cluster into powerful wind systems that can become derechos , @entity91 said			0
a line of such storms travels quickly , often at around 50 to 60 mph , which is much faster than most other types of storms			0
" ( @entity121 ) what looks like a very dark cloud on the horizon very rapidly becomes an imminent threat , " explained @entity91			0
" ( people should ) make sure they know where they go to seek shelter , and what actions they need to take as warnings are issued			0
" calmer conditions should return to the @entity3 on thursday : @entity5 's forecast , for instance , calls for a breezy , mostly sunny day with temperatures reaching a high of around 65			2
by then , the greatest severe weather threat will have shifted east			1
the @entity65 is forecasting that severe weather will be possible thursday in the mid-atlantic , an area that includes that includes @entity140 , @entity90 ; @entity141 ; @entity142 , @entity143 ; @entity144 and the southern half of @entity146			1
a much bigger chunk of the eastern @entity71 -- from @entity148 and @entity149 extending north up the @entity150 to @entity151 -- has a slight chance of severe weather , likely in the form of strong thunderstorms			1
@entity0 's @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157 contributed to this report .			0

new : the mid-atlantic will most likely have severe weather thursday
new : trees and power lines are downed west of @entity5
50 mph wind gusts , dime - sized hail in @entity5 ; stronger winds seen elsewhere
tornado watches extend as far east as @entity89 , @entity90
