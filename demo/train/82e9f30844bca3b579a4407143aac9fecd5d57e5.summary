-- the storm that swept last week across the @entity2 left indelible memories for many , but also erased some			1
@entity5 , whose @entity7 apartment is littered with scraps of paper that represent some of the most important memories of a woman she barely knows , is trying to salvage at least a few of them			1
the 35 - year - old art director for a @entity17 ad agency drove sunday from her home , which is on high ground and did not flood , to the hard - hit @entity21 section of the borough to take pictures of @entity25 's aftermath			1
there , she came across @entity27 , a @entity28 immigrant : her family 's photographs and documents were arrayed on the stone railing leading from the street to her front door			1
@entity35 : drying a @entity37 's memories " i saw she had thousands of pictures , " @entity5 said			1
many were smeared with mud , others were stained by rust			2
the woman 's house was gutted , she had no heat and she was bereft			1
" i said to her , ' would you like me to take these ? ' " @entity5 recalled			1
" she said , ' yes , please , i have nothing left			2
' so i just took it			2
" @entity25 survivors face voting -- and another storm @entity5 took five plastic garbage bags stuffed full of memorabilia , loaded them into the trunk of her car and drove them back to her home			1
" the whole thing was a mess , " she said			2
@entity5 consulted the @entity62 and set about trying to preserve the treasure that had been entrusted to her			1
" it said to wash the pictures with water and just dry them , " she said			2
so she emptied the bags and set to work			1
many of the pictures predate the introduction of digital photographs			1
they chronicle weddings and bar mitzvahs and include images of people presumably long dead			0
among the pictures were citizenship papers , tax returns and a @entity80 medal			0
" it 's all over my house and my floor , " she said			1
@entity5 , who grew up in @entity85 and plans to vote for the first time tuesday in a @entity88 election ( " i think @entity90 , probably			1
" ) , said she was just trying to help			0
but @entity91 , who has restored photographs for about 25 years , said that washing wet photographs may not always achieve that end			1
" it 's the kind of thing that sometimes can help , but sometimes many old photos have dye in them -- water - soluble dye , " he said in a telephone interview			1
@entity91 , who runs @entity101 in @entity102 , said he is guided by the same maxim doctors follow : first , do no harm			0
washing photographs is too risky for him			1
" that might work , but i would n't take a chance doing that because you might take the whole image off it			0
" he advises separating any pictures that may adhere to one another and letting them dry			0
" once they 're stuck together , then it becomes near impossible to deal with anything , " he said			1
" i 've seen 500 pictures dry together			0
it 's basically just a congealed block of paper and glue			2
" @entity123 lets @entity25 victims vote via e-mail @entity91 recommends leaving any picture stuck to glass since trying to pull it away can tear it apart			0
" leave it be , " he said			0
and any wet pictures should be removed from albums , he said			2
" the worst thing you can do is leave them in plastic sleeves and albums			2
" his personal trove of family pictures survived @entity25 in the basement of his home north of the city in @entity142 -- " raised about 6 feet off the ground			0
" @entity144 , a professional photographer for more than 35 years in @entity142 , advised putting wet photographs in a print dryer , but said the devices have largely disappeared since the advent of digital photography			1
" i do n't even know if there is such a thing any more , " he said			0
" my recommendation would be to do as little as possible , " he said			0
" but , if they 're ruined without washing them , then you try washing them			1
" @entity144 , who is launching an online print laboratory called @entity158 , said some companies , including @entity160 , used resin - coated paper -- covered with a thin layer of plastic			2
those photographs " are more likely to wash easier and resist washing better , " he said			1
remembering the victims @entity167 , owner of @entity168 and @entity169 in @entity102 , said washing wet pictures is dangerous			1
" i would put them up on a piece of paper or towel or something absorbent and let the water leach out from the bottom and let the air dry the top , because the surface of the photograph is an emulsion -- you get it wet , it gets sticky and it can smear			2
you can get fingerprints on it			0
you put anything on top of it , it will stick			0
so the best thing to do is just put them face up and let them air dry			0
" only if they were stuck together , he said , would he " very gently " soak them to separate them			0
he recommends those who want to safeguard their pictures have them digitalized and stored that way			0
in general , the approach worked , said @entity208			0
" some of them , the ink in them did n't hold up very well , " she said			0
" but very few , actually			0
most of them are perfect			0
you know what held up best ? @entity160			0
the ones that were printed the old - fashioned way			0
" @entity27 , who has moved from her home to a relative 's , said she was planning to pick up the photographs as soon as they are ready			1
how you can help @entity0 's @entity223 contributed to this report			2

in @entity7 , @entity5 seeks to save a woman 's cache of wet , muddy photographs
she is trying to salvage five plastic bags stuffed with soggy memories
photographer : " if they 're ruined without washing them , then you try washing them "
