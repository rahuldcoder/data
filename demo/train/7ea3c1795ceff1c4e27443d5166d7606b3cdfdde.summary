-- remember when the movies held the impending extinction of human life on the planet as a worst - case scenario -- something that could and would be heroically averted , if only at the last second ? nowadays , the end times are only the beginning : an apocalyptic backdrop is something we 're going to be seeing a lot of this year , so we might as well get used to it			2
in the glossy , derivative , ambitious and fatally underpowered " @entity15 , " @entity14 is the last guy on @entity17			1
he 's @entity18 , a technician -- a mechanic , really -- whose job is to fix broken down drones ( in a cute touch he sticks the first one back together with chewing gum )			0
in other words , he 's a bit like @entity26 , and @entity27 is his latter day @entity28			0
they live in a billion - dollar birdhouse perched up above the clouds , and in a quaintly chauvinist set up , he reconnoiters the skies in a flashy starfighter prototype , while she sits at an interstellar telephone exchange and relays the commands of mission controller @entity38 ( an irritatingly twangy @entity40 ) from on high			2
see , the remainder of the human race has taken refuge on a giant spaceship ( it looks like a floating audio speaker , something that would n't be out of place on the cover of an ' 80s progressive rock album )			2
the plan is to scoot over to @entity52 just as soon as they have sucked up enough hydropower from the @entity17 's oceans to fuel the journey			1
but why ? well , because of the alien invaders who destroyed the moon and threw the biosphere out of whack , that 's why			0
as @entity14 mournfully intones in the movie 's lugubrious prologue , we won the war , but lost the planet			1
that 's what the drones are for : to kill off the last remaining hostiles , or " scavs , " who have taken refuge on the edge of the radioactive wastelands that cover most of the globe			0
that 's more than enough backstory , i know , but there 's much more to come out , even as @entity18 goes about his daily routine , tracking down lost drones , revisiting ruined @entity84 landmarks ( the top of the @entity86 now sits at ground level on a sea of dust ) , and occasionally going @entity89 himself to grapple with fragmentary memories of a beautiful girl ( @entity91 ) , and a lost world he has no right to remember			0
the story is officially credited to an unpublished comic book by the film 's director , @entity98			1
but if you poured all the most memorable sci - fi films from the past half century into a blender , from " 2001 : a @entity102 " and the original " @entity103 " all the way down to last year 's " @entity105 , " you would probably wind up with something very similar and equally synthetic -- though quite possibly more exciting			1
while he immerses us in an often dazzling futurescape , for the most part @entity98 ( " @entity112 " ) lacks the poetic imagination to animate this requiem for a dying world -- comparisons with " @entity26 " are certainly not to this film 's advantage -- and fails to convince us that he genuinely cares about the fate of his characters , let alone the planet			1
the movie 's few action scenes are competent but unlikely to wow any battle - seasoned gamers out there			1
@entity98 does produce one rabbit from his hat , a real surprise late in the game that sends the movie for a loop , but also undermines a good deal of the credibility he 's worked hard to build up over the preceding hour and a half or so			0
like " @entity105 , " this is another of those earnest , overdetermined spiritual allegories that falls apart in the rear - view mirror			0
it is certainly nice to look at though			0
director of photography @entity140 was last seen picking up an @entity142 for his breathtaking work on " @entity144 , " and his images of an @entity17 turned to ash are almost as alluring			1
they 're enough to lend the picture a sense of scope and even grandeur , but they ca n't paper over the cracks running right through its core			0
" @entity15 " shoots for the moon and falls short .			2

" @entity15 " is a @entity14 sci - fi film ; he stars as the last guy on @entity17
