@entity0 , @entity1 -- representatives for leading social conservative groups in @entity1 held a secret meeting monday as part of an effort with one main goal : find and support a @entity10 presidential candidate who can stop @entity11 in @entity1			1
the idea : avoid splintering the conservative vote in the state by rallying around one @entity10 rival who could win @entity1 's jan. 3 caucus and then challenge @entity11 in @entity17 and the other early voting states			1
many social conservatives and other religious leaders in the state have openly labeled the former @entity23 governor as a " flip - flopper , " a criticism the campaign frequently beats back , while others have seen @entity11 's @entity29 faith as an issue			1
and many of them have openly hoped for someone to emerge as a viable alternative to the former @entity23 governor			2
@entity2 reached out to the @entity11 campaign for reaction to the secret meeting and the overall @entity38 effort			1
" gov. @entity11 is running a 50 - state campaign			1
he 's going to be competitive in @entity1 , @entity17 , @entity42 and all the other early states , " said @entity11 campaign spokesman @entity40			1
" he 's reaching out to each and every voter			2
" one attendee at the meeting earlier this week told @entity2 they wanted " to see if they could come to a consensus of who they might endorse			2
" but the source was skeptical about the impact of @entity1 social conservatives rallying behind one candidate			1
" if you want to stop @entity11 you 're probably going to have to have some organization [ and ] some money , " the source said			1
" somebody who 's at 5 % or 6 % in the polls , and they endorse , i do n't think that does any good			0
" multiple sources have described to @entity2 details of the meeting and the general effort			0
the meeting , the group 's first , took place in a private office building in @entity0 on monday			0
in attendance were representatives from the @entity74 , @entity75 , the group @entity77 , and a representative for the @entity1 chapter of @entity80			1
some pastors from prominent @entity1 churches also attended the meeting			2
the effort seems limited to @entity1 , with no apparent outreach to similar groups in other states			2
while the concerns have been voiced before , what appears to be new is the meeting itself and organizers ' hope for like - minded groups to come together against @entity11 , at least in @entity1			1
sources say there were about 20 to 25 people present at the meeting and that another meeting is planned for monday of next week			0
the effort is said to still be in the discussion phase			0
participants were said to have narrowed their focus down to four candidates : @entity106 rep. @entity105 , @entity108 gov. @entity107 , former house speaker @entity109 and former @entity111 sen. @entity110			0
@entity1 social conservatives want to find alternative @entity2 spoke with @entity114 , vice-president of @entity75 , regarding the meeting			1
initially , he was reluctant to discuss the gathering			0
" there was a statement made in the meeting not to divulge the contents of the meeting , " @entity114 said			0
@entity114 said he had invited some attendees and confirmed the meeting 's purpose was , in fact , to seek a consensus pick to topple @entity11 , who has been at or near the top of recent polls in the state			1
he added that the group is not trying to take on any authority role			0
" they 're very unofficial , " @entity114 said			0
@entity114 also helped to clarify why @entity134 businessman @entity133 and @entity108 rep. @entity135 were not part of the conversation			0
" my best recollection is that there were some issues about states ' rights , as they pertained to the sanctity of human life and marriage , " @entity114 said , although he could not recall specific arguments against the two candidates			0
" i think that was more @entity135			0
" @entity114 also stressed many attendees praised @entity133			0
but there were concerns about " a lack of clarity with mr. @entity133 ... lack of consistency on issues of sanctity of life and marriage			0
" " i think with mr. @entity133 there was some concern he 's maybe not quite experienced enough in civics ... and maybe not quite ready for that number one job , " @entity114 added			0
the @entity133 and @entity135 campaigns challenged similar , yet separate , criticisms on tuesday when one of the groups took both men out of consideration for its presidential endorsement			0
regarding the sexual harassment claims lobbed against @entity133 -- claims the candidate strongly denies -- @entity114 said : " that was not mentioned , that i can recall			2
" @entity175 , the executive director of @entity77 , also attended the monday meeting			0
" i was invited by the leader of @entity75 , " @entity175 said , referring to @entity114			0
" my understanding was , i 'm assuming he was the one who really spearheaded the meeting			0
" @entity175 explained that she listened to the appeals from attendees			0
however , @entity175 said neither she nor board members of her group will endorse a candidate ahead of the caucuses			2
for those reasons , @entity175 said she did not participate in the conversation and will not attend the upcoming meeting or others			0
several groups rise up against @entity11 @entity192 , president and ceo of @entity75 , who was not at the monday meeting and spoke to @entity2 only broadly about the conservative opposition to @entity11			2
" it 's no secret that there 's many conservatives throughout @entity1 who are looking for the alternative to @entity11 , who can win @entity1 , and then who can go the distance in @entity17 and beyond and become our nominee that can beat @entity207 , " @entity192 said			1
" our concern is that if the conservatives stay as fragmented as they are , that @entity11 could win the @entity1 caucuses			1
and if he wins the @entity1 caucuses , he 'll be the nominee , " @entity192 added			2
" so i think there 's an urgency to say , ' well who is the person that could best challenge [ @entity11 ] then move on after @entity1 ? " @entity216 , senior minister of the @entity217 in @entity218 , explained the opposition to the former @entity23 governor among some @entity222 and social conservatives			1
" i think there is a concern we not splinter our support amongst several candidates to the point that somebody gets in the nomination who does n't share our values , " @entity216 said			0
@entity216 added that , in his view , @entity11 has " waffled " on two issues that social conservatives care deeply about : the definition of marriage as between one man and one woman , and abortion			1
yet @entity216 warned , " i do n't think any of us are going to find a candidate we agree with 100 % on every issue			2
" some also feel that @entity11 has repeatedly snubbed this key voting group in @entity1			1
" i think he is sticking his finger in the eyes of the social conservatives by neglecting [ them ] , " said @entity245 , president of the @entity74			1
@entity11 going after ' all caucus goers ' citing the candidate 's " pro-jobs , pro-growth message " and 25 years in business , @entity11 campaign spokesman @entity40 said the governor " is the strongest candidate to take on and defeat president @entity207 in 2012			1
" " gov. @entity11 is reaching out to all caucus goers , to all primary voters -- to everybody who intends to vote in the @entity10 nominating contests across the country , " @entity40 said			1
as for claims that @entity11 is inconsistent , @entity40 said the former @entity23 governor has clearly " laid out his positions in his book , on the campaign trail and in numerous policy proposals			1
" @entity11 currently leads , or is near the top , in several polls for @entity1			1
a recent @entity2 / @entity276 / @entity275 poll from late october , as well as a @entity278 survey , both showed @entity11 essentially tied with @entity133 .			2
