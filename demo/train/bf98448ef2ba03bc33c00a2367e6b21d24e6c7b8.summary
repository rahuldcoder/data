-- @entity2 's long - anticipated official announcement that he 's running for mayor of @entity4 began with a slight glitch this week : a video announcing his candidacy was posted on @entity8 in the middle of the night , then yanked off the site -- and eventually posted again			1
the two - minute video did exactly what it was intended to do : launch @entity2 2.0 , promoting him as an earnest family man bursting with energy , ideas and promise , and offering to lead @entity4 as its chief executive			1
but the stutter - step in the timing is a metaphor for @entity2 's relationship to media			1
it remains to be seen whether the same digital platforms that catapulted him to national prominence -- and later proved to be his undoing -- will end up being a blessing , a curse , or a distraction as @entity2 joins a crowded race for @entity34			1
there 's no question that @entity2 has media star power that far outstrips his half - dozen or so @entity39 rivals			1
for years , he was a fixture on cable news programs , ready with quips , strategic insight , and fighting words fired at adversaries on the floor of @entity47			0
but almost exactly two years ago , the shadow side of @entity2 's media life emerged , when the then - congressman mistakenly blasted a lewd photo to his thousands of @entity53 followers			1
his conservative enemies pounced on the image and soon discovered -- and trumpeted to the world -- that @entity2 was sending lascivious texts and photos to women around the country , some from his office on @entity63			2
after a short period in which he told outrageous lies about the photos , claiming his computer was hacked , @entity2 quit @entity47 and dropped out of public life			0
he now says that the six women with whom he 's known to have exchanged randy messages -- and the lies he told about it -- represent the sum total of his misbehavior			0
that may be true , although @entity4 's political insiders generally assume more photos could emerge in the weeks ahead			0
but the incident leaves @entity2 as a strange media hybrid -- a star nationally , but an uprooted local candidate facing formidable challenges in his hometown			1
the national press finds him irresistible , with conservatives eager to bash him and liberals hoping to rehabilitate him			0
his wife , @entity85 , is a glamorous , globally famous personality in her own right , having served at the right hand of former @entity90 @entity89			0
the couple moved from @entity2 's working - class apartment in @entity93 -- he happened to quit as @entity4 's congressional boundaries were being redrawn , and his district was simply eliminated			1
@entity2 now lives in a luxury building on @entity97 in @entity98 , where paparazzi lie in wait to snap photos nearly every time he leaves the house			1
to most @entity4 politicians , such obsessive media attention would be considered a gift from the gods			0
but it 's a double - edged sword for @entity2			1
at the same time he was electrifying left - leaning audiences on national tv , @entity2 was building a reputation in @entity4 as a centrist @entity111 arguing for tax cuts and other relief for working - class @entity4			2
the son of a public school teacher and a lawyer , he made much of his middle - class roots and vowed to bring gritty , neighborhood - based values to city hall			2
in local politics , that remains @entity2 's central persona : a working - class truth teller , willing to ruffle feathers and challenge liberal orthodoxy			2
but it 's hard to make that argument from @entity97 , and @entity2 's opponents seldom fail to mention his luxury digs , which are very much at odds with his persona as spokesman for the forgotten middle class			1
no other candidate in the race comes close to having @entity2 's years of experience in delivering talking points on camera , debating one - on - one and packaging complex policies in short , comprehensible bites			2
but @entity4 mayoral contests are n't decided on tv or @entity53			0
residents like to see their candidates up close and personal , in literally hundreds of meetings of political clubs , church basements , block associations and the like			0
@entity2 has always been effective on the stump , but it remains to be seen how he 'll be greeted			2
his video announcement was , among other things , a way to control his image			0
as he makes the rounds of debates , forums and other places where @entity4 are known to give candidates an unscripted piece of their mind , we 'll see if @entity163 will sell in the parts of @entity4 that the national talking heads rarely visit			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity168 .			0

@entity168 : @entity2 launched his mayoral candidacy , *touting* , ideas promise
he says his media star power double - edged sword ; *scrutiny* of his texts led to his undoing
he says @entity2 , middle class champion , lives on @entity97
louis : @entity2 *skilled* , experienced politician ; he 'll need it in rough , on the ground race
