-- at 23 , many people around the world are still at university -- at that age , @entity1 had already started one			1
the young entrepreneur is the founder of @entity8 ( @entity8 ) , @entity10 's first private online university			1
launched in late 2012 , the school allows students to access their classes at any time of the day with any internet - enabled device			0
" we are providing executive programs for graduates who are looking for employment and want to build up their resumes , or managers who want to climb up the hierarchy of their companies , " says @entity1 , now 25			2
" we also have courses targeted at people who want to start their own business			0
" ' @entity10 's @entity27 ' @entity1 's idea to start @entity8 came from his previous online venture called @entity30 , an educational social networking site he 'd launched while in university that allows learners to interact and access free resources from leading schools			1
" when i created @entity30 in 2010 , " explains @entity1 , " i found out that ... many were looking for certificates , hoping that they could get something they could use to maybe find employment or get a promotion in the workplace			2
" there was a need for a new institution to be created in @entity10 , " adds @entity1 , who was once described by @entity42 as " @entity10 's @entity27			1
" now , some 18 months into his new business endeavor , @entity1 has hired 10 instructors and has about 200 students , with an average age of 26			1
but the startup 's journey so far has not been without challenges -- @entity10 laws require universities to have a physical campus so last year @entity1 went and bought land in the country 's @entity57 with the goal to build a private campus that could accommodate some 10,000 students			1
the project is expected to launch next year , but in the meantime the web courses are up and running -- a 12 week online program can cost between $ 100 and $ 300			2
among the courses offered are corporate diplomacy , global marketing , leadership and management , digital journalism , project management and entrepreneurship and innovation , which is the university 's most popular class			1
" it 's good because i have four kids , " says @entity77 , one of @entity8 's students			1
" i have opportunity to work at the same time , because i have a small interior design outfit			0
" @entity83 , another @entity8 student , says he enrolled " for the knowledge			2
" " it is just helpful for my business and that is the most important thing to me , " he explains			0
education is key a son of two teachers , @entity1 says he is driven by his passion to use technology to solve social problems			0
" i grew up within the framework where education was put at a very high level of importance , and entrepreneurship is something that i always wanted to do , " he says			0
" without education i do n't think we can do any progress , " he adds			0
" it 's not just about getting a certificate -- education is about teaching people how to make a living and teaching people how to live ; how to interact with others , how to lead their lives and make something out of themselves , " continues @entity1			2
" with education comes discipline and we need a lot of discipline in @entity10 as well , so education is really important			0
" @entity1 relies mainly on social media to advertize but says that it 's student referrals that are increasing @entity8 's enrollment			1
" we still have a long way to go , we have a lot of work to do , a lot of policy wrangling too , " he admits			0
" but it 's a work in progress and we are quite happy with where we are			0
