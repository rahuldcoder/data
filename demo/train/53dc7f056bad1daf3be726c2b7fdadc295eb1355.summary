-- pre-tournament favorites the @entity1 qualified for the quarterfinals of the @entity4 with a 3 - 1 victory against @entity6 in @entity7 on friday night , despite having @entity8 sent off			1
the elephants have four points from two games , leaving @entity6 and @entity12 to fight for the other place from @entity14 , with @entity15 having withdrawn following the deadly gun attack on their team bus			1
@entity6 's @entity6 will need to show more penetration next tuesday than they did on a boggy - looking , cut up pitch in @entity21 , with @entity12 needing just a draw to go through			1
injury - hit @entity6 , four - time winners of the tournament , started with captain @entity25 on the bench as he was deemed not ready to play due to the hamstring problem that delayed his arrival from @entity30			2
and while his side made it a bright start , it was the @entity34 who took the lead in the 23rd minute after a swift counter-attack , with @entity39 midfielder @entity38 threading a slide - rule pass behind the defense to @entity42 which allowed the @entity44 striker to square a simple chance for @entity46 to knock into the net			0
@entity42 's clubmate @entity25 came on at halftime for @entity50 and gave his team more presence in midfield , but it was the @entity1 who were left to rue strongarm tactics when @entity56 's @entity8 was red - carded for a dreadful two - footed lunge on @entity58 in the 55th minute			1
@entity59 almost made the @entity34 pay immediately , but his left - foot shot hit the base of the post with goalkeeper @entity63 well beaten			0
but @entity6 paid for their lack of finishing when @entity66 fired in a superb free - kick in the 67th minute , with his dipping left - foot effort from the right - hand side of the pitch clearing the wall and beating keeper @entity72 at his near post			2
@entity42 was stretchered off soon after following a collision with a teammate , but the @entity1 were comfortable and added a third goal in the final minute of regulation time when his replacement @entity79 did well to deliver a cross which captain @entity81 powerfully headed home at the far post			0
@entity6 were given a consolation penalty in time added on when halftime substitute @entity86 went down under a 50 - 50 challenge from @entity88 , and the @entity90 striker got up to slot the goal .			0

@entity1 reach last eight of @entity4 with 3 - 1 win over @entity6 in @entity7
