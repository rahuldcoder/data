long lines formed at help centers and lawyers ' office across @entity4 wednesday as thousands of young , undocumented immigrants began applying for relief from deportation			1
they took advantage of one of the biggest immigration policy changes in years			2
an executive order by president @entity12 allows those who entered the country illegally as children to remain and work without fear of deportation for at least two years			1
a crowd formed at @entity20 's @entity19 wednesday to get help from immigration lawyers and fill out forms			1
" i was able to learn the customs and traditions , and i am used to living the life here , " @entity24 , 16 , told @entity26 affiliate @entity25			2
she arrived in the @entity4 as a child from @entity31 and said she is very much @entity4			1
faces of hope : lining up for two more years in the @entity4 " i feel i am a citizen , " she said			1
" the only thing that is stopping me is a little piece of paper			2
" tuesday , at a @entity39 community center in @entity40 , @entity41 , a young @entity42 , leaped from her seat			2
" i 've found the form ! " she screamed			2
she was with a number of other undocumented immigrants meeting there to get legal advice in anticipation of the release of the form , which authorities surprisingly posted a day before they had said they would			1
the form , titled " consideration of @entity55 , " was dated august 15 , 2012 , and bore the expiration date of february 28 , 2013			2
@entity41 started filling it out immediately , telling a reporter she was too afraid to divulge her last name or details of her childhood trek to the @entity4 , but would feel differently once the form had been processed and her status ensured			1
@entity64 , the director of @entity65 , said applicants who have not committed major crimes can apply without fear of deportation			2
the forms were made available two months after homeland security secretary @entity71 said that people who arrived in the @entity4 as children may request consideration of deferred action for a period of two years subject to renewal , and upon approval would be eligible for work authorization			1
as many as 1.7 million youths may qualify for the program , according to the @entity82 , a project of the @entity82			1
dubbed consideration of @entity55 , the deferral program was created in june under an executive order signed by president @entity12			1
however , there is no guarantee of its future if @entity12 is not re-elected			0
@entity91 @entity90 would then have the power to revoke the order			0
the program also does not guarantee public benefits to successful applicants			1
that allowed @entity99 gov. @entity98 to issue an executive order wednesday directing state agencies to deny benefits -- including driver 's licenses -- to deferred action recipients			1
" the program does not provide for any additional public benefit to unlawfully present aliens beyond the delayed enforcement of @entity4 immigration laws and the possible provision of employment authorization , " the executive order states			1
it says granting public benefits to deferred action recipients would have " significant and lasting impacts " on @entity99 's budget , health care system and other taxpayer - funded benefits			1
@entity98 's order drew immediate criticism from supporters of immigration reform and the @entity124 , which would offer temporary legal status to young illegal immigrants who have graduated high school and want to attend college or join the military			1
eventually , they could obtain permanent residency or citizenship			1
" gov. @entity98 is directly attacking children and immigrant youth , who with no fault of their own , were brought to the @entity4 , " said the @entity133			1
the group organized a march to the @entity140 on wednesday , carrying a large banner reading " @entity142			0
" when he signed the deferred action order , @entity12 said the changes would make immigration policy " more fair , more efficient and more just			0
" undocumented students in their own words the shift on the politically volatile issue of immigration policy elicited praise from @entity39 leaders , while @entity91 reacted with outrage , saying the move amounts to amnesty -- a negative buzzword among conservatives -- and usurps congressional authority			1
" this is not amnesty , " @entity12 said			0
" this is not immunity			0
this is not a path to citizenship			1
it 's not a permanent fix			2
this is a temporary stopgap measure			0
" @entity64 reiterated tuesday that deferred action does not provide lawful status or a shortcut to permanent residency or citizenship			1
a $ 465 application fee will fund the administrative costs of the program , including a biometric check and the issuance of a secure work - authorization document , he said			1
each request will be examined for possible fraud , he added			0
@entity181 said her parents brought her and her sister , @entity183 , to the @entity4 without any documentation many years ago when they were just toddlers			1
they were filling out the paperwork for the deferred action program in suburban @entity187			2
i did n't have a choice to come here , " @entity188 said			0
lawyer @entity191 said the young immigrants just want a chance at life without fear of deportation			0
" they are getting two things out of this program : one , a promise they wo n't be deported for two years and , two , a work permit , " @entity191 said			1
" in exchange , the federal government is getting a million or more kids coming forward , give their biographical information and that of their whole family and give their pictures			0
" he urged anyone applying to do so with the help of a lawyer			0
" the government has said quite clearly : there will be no appeals			0
there will be no motions to reopen , " he said			0
" you get one bite at this apple			0
" in announcing the program , @entity12 noted that children of illegal immigrants " study in our schools , play in our neighborhoods , befriend our kids , pledge allegiance to our flag			1
it makes no sense to expel talented young people who are , for all intents and purposes , @entity4			1
" the president declared that the policy change is " the right thing to do			0
" under the new policy , people 30 and younger who arrived in the @entity4 before the age of 16 , pose no criminal or security threat , and were successful students or served in the military , can get a two - year deferral from deportation and apply for work permits			1
participants must prove they have been living in the country continuously for at least five years			0
the change is part of a department effort to target resources at illegal immigrants who pose a greater threat , such as criminals and those trying to enter the country now , @entity254 said			0
the move addresses a concern of the @entity39 community and includes some of the provisions of the @entity124 , which failed to win enough @entity91 support to gain congressional approval			0
the name is an acronym for @entity124			0
@entity12 has been criticized by @entity39 leaders for an overall increase in deportations of undocumented immigrants in recent years			2
last year , @entity275 removed 396,906 illegal immigrants , the largest number in the agency 's history			2
@entity12 and @entity254 have called for @entity280 to pass the @entity124 , which would put into law similar steps for children of illegal immigrants to continue living and working in the country			2
republicans who blocked @entity287 efforts to change immigration laws have condemned the move , with some calling it an improper maneuver to skirt congressional opposition			0
rep. @entity293 of @entity294 , a @entity91 foe of @entity287 proposals on immigration , threatened in june to sue to stop @entity12 " from implementing his unconstitutional and unlawful policy			0
" @entity91 sen. @entity300 of @entity301 has called the decision " a classic @entity12 move of choosing politics over leadership , " while @entity304 chairman @entity303 , @entity305 , has called the change a " decision to grant amnesty to potentially millions of illegal immigrants			0
" others predicted the move will tighten an already poor job market for young @entity4			1
however , @entity287 sen. @entity316 of @entity317 , who sponsored the @entity124 , said it " will give these young immigrants their chance to come out of the shadows and be part of the only country they 've ever called home			0
" presumed @entity91 presidential candidate @entity90 said in june that the issue needs more substantive action than an executive order , which can be replaced by a subsequent president			0
as president , @entity90 said , he would seek to provide " certainty and clarity for people who come into this country through no fault of their own by virtue of the actions of their parents			2
" @entity338 make up the fastest - growing immigrant population in the country , and the @entity39 vote is considered a crucial bloc for the november presidential election			0
a spokeswoman for a major @entity39 group , the @entity344 , hailed the administration 's move			2
" in light of the congressional inaction on immigration reform , this is the right step for the administration to take at this time , " @entity344 spokeswoman @entity347 said in june			0
