@entity0 -- they 've spent 10 years together , swinging by the @entity3 and @entity4 on a cosmic roadtrip that has taken them to a mysterious celestial body but on wednesday they are due to separate -- the parting marked with farewell photographs			1
watch @entity12 's incredible journey the @entity15 landing craft that is due to touch down on the surface of a comet hurtling towards the @entity18 will snap some images of the mother ship @entity12 after it breaks its bonds and embarks on its seven - hour descent to the surface of @entity24 -- @entity25 for short			1
@entity12 has already become the first probe to orbit a comet , and , if successful , @entity15 will notch up another achievement by becoming the first craft to land on one			1
led by the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) with a consortium of partners including @entity34 , scientists hope to learn more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the solar wind -- high energy particles blasted into space by the @entity18 some believe water may have been brought to @entity3 by comets , or even the chemicals that make up the building blocks of life			1
this mission may shed new light on the theory as @entity15 is equipped to detect organic chemicals on the surface			1
" it 's quite extraordinary that we are able to do this -- to track a comet and see the evolution of a comet			2
we have a ringside seat , " said @entity31 lander system engineer @entity57			2
@entity12 comet landing : ' we can do amazing things , if we dream big ' " this is the first time this has been done -- to land on a comet , to follow it			2
" but the landing on november 12 is fraught with difficulty			1
engineers can not steer @entity15 once it has separated from @entity12 and the trajectory has to be programed			2
choosing a suitable set down point has also been problematic			0
@entity12 's survey from orbit revealed an irregular shaped body that is littered with boulders -- and scientists needed to find a site that is in enough light to charge @entity15 's batteries			1
@entity57 says there 's lots of risks and puts their chances of success at about 70 %			0
" you have to face reality , " he said			0
this was the best of the five possible landing sites -- we 've got what the comet has given us			2
it 's the best of the worst			0
" there 's craters , crevices , boulders , gravelly areas			0
it [ @entity15 ] could tip over			2
the comet is a very strange structure and there 's a lot of luck involved , " he said			0
the comet 's gravity is so weak that there 's also a danger that @entity15 could bounce off so it has been designed to grip on like a limpet			1
@entity57 explained that at touchdown , harpoons from two of the three feet fire into the surface and the attached cords rewind to help anchor the craft			0
a thruster on top of the probe fires to push down the probe , and screws on each foot bore into the surface -- all within 15 seconds of landing			0
if it works then the surface science can really begin			0
@entity15 will capture a high - resolution image of the landing site just before it sets down and then return a panoramic picture from its seven cameras on the top edge of the craft			1
even the harpoons have another use			0
" this is very cool , " said @entity57			0
" accelerometers in the harpoons can measure the deceleration so you get a very good idea of the ' hardness ' of the surface			0
it 's an amazing what @entity15 can do , " he said			1
mission controllers will face a nail - biting wait for first news from the spacecraft			0
at landing , @entity57 says the comet will be more than 500 million kilometers ( 310 million miles ) from @entity3 so a signal from the probe will take just short of half an hour to reach us -- and more than an hour for the first pictures			1
@entity15 carries nine instruments that @entity31 says will measure the density and thermal properties of the surface , magnetic fields , gases , and the interaction between the comet and the solar wind			1
it also has a drill that can bore up to 20 centimeters ( 12.4 inches ) into the comet and return a sample to a tiny oven that will heat the material and analyze its content			0
@entity15 has an initial 65 hours of battery life but scientists hope they will be able to recharge and continue working for three months			1
after that , they believe the comet will be so close to the @entity18 and the temperature so intense that @entity15 will not be able to operate			2
@entity169 of the @entity170 in @entity0 says if the landing succeeds it will be an amazing achievement			0
" @entity12 matters because it 's the first time we 'll be able to see and analyze a comet from its surface			2
hopefully we 'll also have the incredible experience of watching that surface change as the comet swings in towards the @entity18 it might just be that @entity15 lands right next to an erupting jet that spews out the material that becomes the cometary tail			1
" @entity183 is already giving off a dust jet as it is warmed by the @entity18 -- something that can be seen from recent @entity12 images			0
@entity57 says that the coma ( the gas around the comet ) already extends to 19,000 km ( 11,875 miles ) but the comet will eventually have a tail 100,000 km ( 62,000 miles ) long as its orbit takes it closer to the @entity18 the comet will make its closest approach to the @entity18 in august 2015 before returning to the outer solar system			0
@entity15 may not be working then but @entity31 mission controllers hope that @entity12 is still returning data a year from now			1
you can follow @entity12 's progress on @entity31 's blog @entity1 special coverage : @entity12 and its mission			1

@entity31 's @entity15 landing craft is due to touch down on a comet surface on november 12
the mission may shed light on whether water may have been brought to @entity3 by comets
@entity15 has been designed to grip like a limpet because the comet 's gravity is so weak
if successful , first pictures could come back about two hours after landing
