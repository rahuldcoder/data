@entity0 -- president @entity3 's trip to @entity4 , @entity5 , will be historic from the moment @entity7 touches down friday			1
his weekend visit will mark the longest time a @entity10 president will have spent in that country , where security concerns had limited previous presidential trips			1
during his visit for the sixth @entity16 , the president plans to focus on the economy , trade , energy and regional security			1
he 's also expected to highlight some of the democratic and social reforms in the region			2
in a speech friday in @entity25 , @entity26 , en route to @entity4 , @entity3 announced a new program that the @entity29 is calling the @entity30 of the @entity31 , which he said would help businesses get financing and counseling on how to access new markets south of the @entity10 border			1
" this initiative is going to help our small business			0
latino - owned businesses , " he said			0
" women - owned businesses			0
" but the agenda may be driven by other concerns that have been debated by the @entity48 leaders long before they arrived for the summit			0
@entity50 , which is not a member of the @entity52 , is not invited to join the 34 other leaders			2
" this is a point of contention , " said @entity54 , a @entity55 senior fellow who specializes in @entity10 - @entity48 relations			2
" there is a lot of disagreement about the @entity10 policy toward @entity50			1
... @entity50 does n't have a democratically elected government and therefore does n't meet the criteria , " he said			2
but that did n't stop @entity68 's leftist president @entity67 from stoking the fire to get @entity50 leader @entity70 a seat at the table			1
@entity67 threatened to put together a boycott with other leaders in the @entity75 ( @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 ) , which led to intense diplomacy behind the scenes			0
inviting @entity70 would have certainly caused problems for @entity3 , especially in an election year			2
during the previous summit three years ago in @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity3 had an uncomfortable encounter with @entity87 , when the @entity76 leader handed him a book critical of the @entity10 and @entity90			1
@entity5 officials were clearly aware of the potential fallout in this case , so the country 's foreign minister was dispatched to @entity50			1
@entity5 president @entity96 himself then flew to @entity50 to meet with @entity70			1
those meetings effectively ended the dispute , but @entity68 's @entity67 was angry			0
he fired off a letter to @entity96 criticizing the veto of @entity50 's participation as " intolerable			2
" then he boycotted the summit , even though the other leaders who had supported his appeal confirmed they would attend			0
@entity54 , of the @entity55 , said some leaders in the region are frustrated with what they view as a leftover @entity109 attitude in the @entity10 toward @entity50 , and they are pushing for changes			1
" my concern is that if it is fixed at the cost of abandoning the democratic rules of the group , that would too high a price to pay , " @entity54 said			0
the high price being paid in the drug war across @entity48 is also fueling a debate			1
at a recent meeting at the @entity29 with the leaders of @entity122 and @entity123 , @entity3 was blunt about the ongoing threat in a region where some of the leaders believe the drug war is failing			1
" beyond our borders , these cartels and traffickers pose an extraordinary threat to our @entity134 neighbors , " @entity3 said			2
one possible solution that some of those neighbors discussed is decriminalizing drugs			0
but on a recent trip to @entity122 , a country that has been ravaged by drug - related violence , @entity10 vice president @entity139 rejected that idea			1
" there is no possibility that the @entity3 - @entity139 administration will change its policy on legalization , " he said			0
while this debate wo n't dominate the discussions at the summit , it could make headlines			1
@entity154 spokesman @entity153 told @entity1 , " it 's likely the issue will come up , and we welcome the discussion			0
however , our policy is different , " he said			0
the unscripted moments are likely to be the most interesting at the summit as there is no significant agreement expected on any of the major issues			0
@entity1 's @entity165 contributed to this report			0
