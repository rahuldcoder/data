the 77 - year itch has been scratched , history has been rewritten and the yearning is no longer			2
perhaps now -- after becoming the first @entity5 man to win @entity6 for what seemed an eternity , @entity9 will finally feel loved			1
a straight sets victory over @entity11 in the final was accomplished with the grit and vigor for which this champion is renowned -- but it is his softer side which has endeared him to the wider world			0
just 12 months ago , @entity9 stood on @entity17 and cried			1
he cried tears of pain and anguish -- showing a part of himself of which very few ever knew existed following his final defeat			0
" it feels slightly different to last year , " @entity9 told fans on @entity17			1
" last year was one of the toughest moments of my career , so to manage to win the tournament today			0
" it was an unbelievably tough match , so many long games			0
" my head was everywhere in that last game , he was hitting some unbelievable shots and i think that is why at the end of the match i almost did n't know what had happened			0
" the last 30 minutes have been a bit a bit of a blur			0
i just do n't know what to say			0
" turning point that defeat in the final to @entity47 was a turning point -- not just in @entity9 's career , but in his relationship with @entity5 tennis fans			1
he was no longer the angry , skinny , and grumpy teenager which had always threatened but never quite delivered			0
no , this time the @entity5 public knew they had someone special			1
as those tears streamed down his face , the nation finally realized that this was a man who just desperately wanted to give the country what it wanted -- a @entity6 champion			1
fast - forward 12 months and with the @entity67 title already in the bag and the experience of winning @entity71 gold on the very same court , @entity9 produced his finest hour			1
a straight sets victory over @entity75 is an astonishing achievement -- more so given the level of pressure heaped on @entity9 around this time of year			1
@entity9 is all too aware of the history			1
not since @entity80 won the last of his three titles in 1936 had a @entity5 man won the singles tournament at @entity6			1
it was the year that @entity90 won four gold medals at the @entity92 , the year when the @entity89 began , a time when @entity85 abdicated the throne to marry @entity87 and @entity88 was reelected president of the @entity94 following a landslide victory			0
@entity96 since @entity9 emerged from the shadows of @entity100 and @entity101 , the weight of expectation has hung around his neck like an albatross			2
but whereas last year he had yet to win a grand slam tournament before taking on @entity47 in last year 's final , that is no longer the case			0
his dramatic five set win over @entity11 at the @entity67 last september came on the back of his @entity71 triumph and gave him the belief he belonged at the very top			0
working alongside coach @entity111 , a man who like @entity9 also lost his first four grand slam finals , has given the @entity114 - born player an extra edge			1
" he believed in me when a lot of people did n't , " @entity9 told reporters			2
" he stuck by me through some tough losses the last couple of years			0
he 's been very patient with me			0
i 'm just happy i managed to do it for him			0
" that belief was in evidence on @entity17 as he endured a brutal battle against one of the fittest men on the circuit in @entity11			0
there were punishing baseline rallies , moments of cross court genius , drop - shots to delight and a level of willpower seen only at the very pinnacle of the sport			2
after taking the first set 6 - 4 , @entity9 was forced to show the kind of resilience which he has become so well known for			1
in his quarterfinal tie against @entity141 , he came from two sets down to triumph , while he also trailed in his semifinal before fighting back to claim victory			0
fightback so when @entity11 led 4 - 1 in the second set , there were few brave enough to write @entity9 off , even against one of the finest players of his generation			1
from 4 - 1 down , @entity9 rallied , showing all the qualities which have turned him into a modern day @entity154 on the tennis court			1
there was fight , there was passion , but there was also a vital component of coolness in the heat of the battle which gave him an extra edge			0
from 4 - 1 down , @entity9 broke back to level at 4 - 4 before taking the set 7 - 5 as @entity11 's nerve began to falter			1
with just one set separating him from sporting immortality , @entity9 began in fine style , breaking @entity11 to take a 2 - 0 lead			1
but the @entity172 , who won the title in 2011 , refused to buckle and battled back to level at 2 - 2 before breaking the home favorite once more to threaten the prospect of a fourth set			2
recovery once again , @entity9 was forced to call upon his powers of recovery , using even muscle and straining every sinew in a bid to level the set			2
backed by vociferous following , he fought his way back to level before breaking @entity11 to lead 5 - 4 and ensure he would serve for the match			1
three consecutive points followed -- three championship points awaited			0
but @entity9 has never been one for making life easy for himself -- nor for his fans who held their collective breath			2
@entity11 staved off three championship points before having the audacity to force @entity9 to save three break points			2
each time , with the pressure growing and the specter of failure on the horizon , @entity9 held firm			2
then , finally , when the fourth championship point presented itself , he took it			0
as @entity9 sank to the turf , a nation rose from its slumber to salute a new champion , a new hero , a sporting icon			2
the rocky road to love might have been a long one but this love affair between @entity9 and the @entity5 public could be just beginning .			1
