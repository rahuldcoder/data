-- twisted metal beams still jut from the top of @entity5 's @entity4 stricken reactors , almost one year after a massive tsunami triggered nuclear meltdown			1
they remain as an eerie monument to the country 's worst ever nuclear disaster , frozen in time by the dangers that surround the reactors and what 's inside			1
the reactors at the northern @entity5 plant were declared last december to be in cold shutdown , a term used to indicate that operations are under control and pose no immediate threat			1
@entity22 , a former senior operator at @entity25 nuclear power plants , said in this instance the words " cold shutdown " are " completely inappropriate " to describe the situation at the @entity4 plant			1
inside @entity4 's meltdown zone " there reactors are very much cold from a nuclear standpoint and from an energy standpoint , and the likelihood of it ever having another criticality or having another explosion is virtually zero , " he said			1
" but it 's a consequence of the fact that they 've now been shut down for a year , much more so than anything that @entity41 or that anybody else has ever done , " he said , referring to the plant 's operators @entity41			2
the biggest threat to the stability of the reactors , @entity22 said , is another earthquake or external event that causes a radioactive leak			2
" the biggest real risk is that a pipe breaks and that hundreds of thousands of gallons of highly radioactive water ends up underground or ends up leeching back into the ocean or something like that			0
that 's the real bottom line , " he said			0
" the chance of a massive contamination or a massive plume of radioactive contamination is almost zero , " he added			0
on march 11 , 2011 more than 15,000 people died after a magnitude - 9.0 earthquake ruptured a 300 kilometer long fault stretching from the southern end of @entity5 's @entity71 to the middle of the @entity73			1
the tremor generated a massive tsunami which smashed into the coast , swamping three prefectures including @entity4 , the site of the @entity4 nuclear plant			1
three of the plant 's six reactors suffered meltdowns despite frantic efforts to flood them with seawater to bring surging temperatures down			2
during a tour of the nuclear plant , manager @entity86 told @entity0 's @entity88 that the biggest risk is if something goes wrong with the reactors			1
the nuclear fuel needs constant cooling			1
huge tanks around the site hold water contaminated with radiation and finding more space to store the water is a constant challenge			2
" the reactors are no more or no less stable than they were in april of last year , " @entity22 said			2
" they fundamentally continue to be reliant on a feed and bleed cooling mechanism and anything can happen			0
another earthquake could happen ; another tsunami could happen			0
" nearly 700 aftershocks of magnitude 5 or greater have been registered since last year 's quake , according to a report released in january by the @entity114 's @entity113			1
the report warned that there was a 70 % chance that a magnitude - 7 quake would hit @entity119 's metropolitan area within four years			2
the probability rose to 98 % probability within the next 30 years , it added			0
@entity119 see high quake probability , scientists warn @entity22 said that while the ticking bomb nature of the @entity4 disaster " very appropriately " focused attention on stabilizing the site , a year later the world should be paying more attention to the inevitable spread of radioactive material			1
" i think that the reason why people do n't give it attention is because they say , you know , the levels of concentration are very low , so even if you did become contaminated the risk to you is actually quite low , which is true , " he said			0
" but again , when you start exposing millions and millions and millions of people to very low levels of concentration , it 's inevitable that it 's going to have an impact			0
" last week , fish and plankton collected from the @entity150 near the @entity4 nuclear power plant were said to contain elevated levels of radioactive materials			1
however , the levels were below those that pose a threat to public health , according to @entity159 , a marine science professor at @entity161 's @entity160			0
the samples were taken in june 2011 , outside the 30 - kilometer ( 19 - mile ) exclusion zone around the plant , at points in and around the @entity166 , the @entity150 version of the @entity168			0
@entity159 said that the contaminants were more likely to have settled in coastal sediments , of which little is known			0
" there 's a lot of key missing information about the sediments , " he said .			0

threats remain despite cold shutdown at @entity4 plant
meltdown at three reactors after last year 's earthquake
nuclear fuel needs constant cooling , contamination water stored nearby
nearly 700 aftershocks have been recorded since the march 11 quake
