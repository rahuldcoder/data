@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the decade since the 1997 handover of @entity0 to @entity1 , local movie - makers have faced daunting changes in the industry			1
a trend of fewer films being produced each year in @entity0 at the time of the handover has continued into the 21st century			1
@entity14 's " @entity13 " is one of @entity0 's all - time top - grossing films			1
people in @entity0 's industry point to several causes for the comparatively leaner times : a lack of opportunities for new acting talent , inadequate training and schooling for people who produce movies and changing tastes within the @entity0 public			1
at the same time , local film - makers have had to refocus their cameras for a new audience : mainland @entity1			1
" the @entity0 film industry came to a rude awakening [ in the late 1990s ] that the world was changing faster than it was in the age of new delivery systems for home entertainment and the @entity38 , " says @entity30 , a local film archivist and curator			1
" unfortunately , it seemed to be blinded by the ' golden age ' of the ' 80s , where any film could easily rack in over $ 1.3 million			2
" the box office numbers are sobering			0
in the early 1990s , @entity0 released around 200 local features a year			1
by 1997 , that number dropped to 85 films grossing $ 69 million , according to the @entity0 , @entity47 and @entity46 ( @entity48 )			1
by 2006 , those figures slumped to 51 films grossing $ 37 million			2
ten years ago , the top 10 grossing films accounted for 47 percent of the total box - office return ; today , the portion is 58 percent			1
" 1997 , unfortunately , coincides with the beginning of the collapse of the local film industry -- a well - documented fact , " says screenwriter @entity54			2
" on the other hand , it also commenced the opening up of the mainland market			1
" the result is that the industry has grown more and more accustomed to looking north for both investment and box return -- nothing political , but more of a survival instinct			2
what needs not to be spelt out for film - makers venturing north is that one plays according to what goes with the territory			2
" the new @entity74 market has translated into an emphasis in contrasts of @entity0 - made films , says film archivist @entity30			1
" today production is down , with many majors like @entity80 and @entity81 scaling back , " he says			2
" most films are high - end productions with big stars , or low - end made with a shoestring budget for an easier return			2
" the number of screens is also down , with the consolidation of more multiplexes , usually owned or partly owned by distributors , which already have a steady supply of foreign films to fill the screens			2
some once video distributors like @entity97 and @entity98 have gone into production as a way to keep the pipeline flowing			0
" in 2006 , @entity0 closed five small cinemas and re-opened one multiplex			1
@entity104 , director of @entity105 -- @entity0 's last - remaining alternative - screening venue -- remains optimistic about more adventurous programming and distribution			1
but @entity104 points to a shortage of creativity in the local industry			0
" no talents , no formal training , in most areas such as script - writing , directing , acting , etc , " he says			0
" even the independent scene still needs more real talents -- or at least , real producers to pull together a really good project			0
" @entity120 , @entity0 consultant for @entity122 's @entity121 , says changing tastes among @entity0 movie - goers has also affected the industry			1
" audiences have become increasingly dismissive of local movies , often referring to them as poor quality , and there are much fewer paying cinemagoers these days			0
" so the hometown audience shows less support for local movies , whether by not seeing local films or opting for piracy , while the declining number of films means less opportunities for film - makers , fewer chances to try out new things , and damage to confidence			1
" @entity143 , film critic and curator formerly based in @entity145 , @entity146 , agrees with @entity120 ' assessment			0
" for all the risk - taking businessmen out there [ in @entity0 ] , no one is willing to put their money where their mouth is and throw in some support			1
" the industry for the most part suffers from the cleave between that fluff -- which makes money -- and the more adult film - making of the smaller studios , distributors and indies			0
" how is @entity146 's film industry different from its @entity0 counterpart ? " the drive to attain world adoration , " @entity163 says			1
" @entity168 truly believe they 're making great art all the time			0
@entity146 launched an active campaign on all levels -- corporate , government , education -- to train and cultivate a modern film industry			0
" still , @entity163 sees reason for optimism			0
films that best retain a @entity0 style , @entity163 maintains , likely carry " @entity181 " ( under 18 not allowed ) ratings : movies that are " grown up and smart , " she says			1
" even if the films do n't work , someone tried			0
" in the end , it may be culture that poses one of the greatest challenges for @entity0 's movie industry			1
" around 1997 , like lots of @entity0 people , i kind of lost myself , " says independent film - maker @entity192			1
" the film industry was already almost dead in the ' 90s			0
why work for a sunset industry ? " @entity192 's own first feature in 2005 , " a side , @entity208 , @entity209 , " includes a scene with a gaggle of girls on @entity0 's @entity204 island who are unable to communicate in @entity74 with an @entity206 man speaking fluent @entity207			1
the two parties end up conversing in @entity211			0
" that 's me , " says @entity192 , referring to the girls			0
" i speak @entity211 better than @entity207 [ @entity1 's official common language , also known as @entity207 ]			0
many @entity1 say that now that @entity0 is part of @entity1 , @entity0 people must learn @entity207			1
in @entity0 we all speak @entity216			2
@entity0 already has a bad reputation for @entity207 , but i do n't feel ashamed			2
i 'm proud to have grown up during the transition between 1997 and @entity219			0
" why do we have so many problems with @entity1 ? because our language , our culture , our values , our way of thinking are different			0
so we are not good at speaking @entity207			0
even in the cinema , we see @entity228 movies , @entity230 movies , @entity232 movies ... but not many @entity74 movies			0
" adds independent director @entity234 : " we are monsters			0
@entity1 says : ' you are not @entity74			0
' @entity236 [ @entity0 slang for @entity238 ] say : ' you are @entity74			2
' after 1997 , we lost the confidence to be @entity0 people			2
" e-mail to a friend			0
