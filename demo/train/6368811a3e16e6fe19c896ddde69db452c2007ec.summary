@entity0 -- good night , @entity1			1
in a series of small ceremonies , the @entity2 on monday shut down @entity5 , a navigation and timing system that has guided mariners and aviators since @entity9 the death blow came last may when president @entity11 called the system obsolete , saying it is no longer needed in an age in which @entity16 devices are nearly ubiquitous in cars , planes and boats			1
killing @entity5 will save the government $ 190 million over five years , @entity11 said			2
but supporters of @entity1 -- including the man known as " the father of @entity16 " -- say the nation 's increasing reliance on @entity16 paradoxically has increased the importance of maintaining @entity1 as a backup			1
supporters also argue that the mere existence of @entity1 makes the gps satellite system a less attractive target for cyber-thugs , terrorists or future military adversaries			2
gps systems today are used not only for navigation , but also to provide precise timing for atm machines , cell phone towers , water plants and other enterprises , and positioning information for precision - guided weapons for the military			2
gps disruptions can be costly to business , dangerous for travelers , and debilitating to the military			0
supporters of @entity1 -- short for long range navigation system -- say the system is a near - perfect backup because it provides similar information to @entity16 , but has dissimilar infrastructure			1
@entity16 is based on a constellation of at least 25 satellites ; @entity1 is based on 24 ground stations in the @entity58 , and others elsewhere			1
@entity16 transmits a very faint signal and is vulnerable to interference or jamming ; @entity1 has a high - power signal which can penetrate obstacles like foliage and is harder to interrupt			1
@entity16 is powered by solar panels ; @entity1 is tied to ground power			1
and while @entity16 operates in outer space , outside of controlled perimeters , @entity1 operates inside controlled perimeters in the @entity58			1
the vulnerability of gps and the consequences of an outage became evident in 2007 during a @entity75 training exercise in the @entity76 , @entity77			0
participants unintentionally jammed gps signals in the region , shutting down satellite navigation and cell phone service up to 10 miles inland for three hours			2
the satellite - based system 's vulnerability became apparent a second time that year , when @entity85 tested an anti-satellite weapon , destroying one of its own aging weather satellites			1
indeed , in recent years , as the popularity of @entity16 soared and the number of @entity1 users dwindled , the fate of the @entity1 system has followed a meandering path of near - death and rebirth experiences that even the most sophisticated navigation system would have difficulty tracking			1
during the @entity100 administration , the system was at one point placed on the chopping block , but was resurrected amid a flurry of reports from @entity1 backers			2
in late 2006 , an @entity106 headed by @entity107 , known as the " father of @entity16 , " unanimously recommended that an enhanced version of @entity1 , known as @entity115 , " be completed and retained as the national backup system for @entity16 , " saying it had " critical safety of life , national and economic security , and quality of life applications			1
" the assessment team recommended that the government complete the @entity118 upgrade and commit to @entity118 as the national backup to @entity16 for 20 years			2
but the @entity11 administration has described @entity1 as unnecessary and antiquated			0
in a may 7 speech , @entity11 used @entity1 as an example of government waste			0
" this system once made a lot of sense , before there were satellites to help us navigate , " @entity11 said			0
" now there 's @entity16			0
and yet , year after year , this obsolete technology has continued to be funded even though it serves no government function and very few people are left who still actually use it			0
" so at 3 p.m. monday , the @entity2 turned off @entity1 signals at 19 of the 24 @entity1 stations			1
signals remain at five stations because of agreements with @entity140 and @entity141 , but the @entity2 expects those stations to be decommissioned by june after the @entity58 receives verification that those countries have been notified of the change			2
the five stations that temporarily remain on line are at @entity147 , in @entity149 's @entity148 , and @entity150 , @entity151 ; @entity152 , @entity153 ; @entity154 , @entity149 ; and @entity155 , @entity0			0
chief warrant officer 4 @entity156 said the @entity1 signals at the 19 closed stations will be on a " hot stand - by " for the next week , allowing the signals to be turned back on if something unforeseen occurs			1
if there are no problems , the transmitters will be completely powered down next monday			0
some congressional critics say it is a mistake to shut down the system			0
in a november letter to homeland security secretary @entity169 , two top members of the @entity171 urged that @entity5 be spared			0
deploying an enhanced @entity1 , or @entity118 , would cost about $ 100 million , sens. @entity173 , i - @entity175 , and @entity176 , @entity177 , wrote -- about one half the amount of placing one new gps satellite in orbit , they said			1
but the case for dismantling @entity1 also has its advocates , including the @entity2			0
in a submission to the @entity185 , the @entity2 said @entity5 was not established as , nor was it it intended to be , a backup for @entity16			1
other radio navigation systems , or operational procedures , can be used as backups for gps navigation and other critical applications , the @entity2 said			0
the @entity192 says it is currently reviewing the nation 's critical infrastructure " to determine if a single , domestic system is needed as a gps backup			2
" " the continued active operation of @entity5 is not necessary to advance this evaluation , " @entity192 said			0
but hope springs eternal for some @entity1 supporters , who hope the @entity2 will mothball the system rather than destroy it			0
mothballing the stations would allow the government to resurrect the system if ongoing studies show @entity1 is the appropriate backup for @entity16			1
but one @entity1 supporter acknowledged that hopes of reviving the system , at this point , may just be " wishful thinking			0

@entity58 shut down 19 of 24 land - based @entity5 navigation stations on monday
@entity213 says @entity1 no longer needed in era of @entity16
critics warn gps is vulnerable to *cyber-attacks* , *suggest* keeping @entity1 as backup
