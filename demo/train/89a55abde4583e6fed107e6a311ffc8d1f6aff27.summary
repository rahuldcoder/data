@entity0 , @entity1 -- between 2010 and 2012 , more than a quarter of a million people died in the famine in @entity1 -- in part because the world was too slow to react , the @entity4 humanitarian coordinator for @entity1 said thursday			1
half of the 258,000 @entity12 who died in the famine were children younger than 5 , @entity10 said in a statement			1
the report , jointly commissioned by the @entity17 and the @entity19 - funded @entity18 , is the first scientific study on deaths in the crisis			1
it " confirms that we should have done more before famine was declared on 20 july 2011 , " @entity10 said			1
the world did not do enough after warnings in 2010 that starvation loomed following severe drought			2
and the people who needed help the most were extremely inaccessible , he said			2
opinion : @entity1 famine a ' crime against humanity ' ? " the suffering played out like a drama without witnesses			1
" a massive mobilization of the humanitarian community followed the official @entity4 declaration of famine , said @entity10 , which " helped mitigate the worst effects of the crisis			1
" the study , which covered the period from october 2010 to april 2012 , suggests that an estimated 4.6 % of the total population and 10 % of children younger than 5 died in southern and central @entity1			1
in the worst - affected area , @entity50 , close to one in five children younger than 5 died			1
at the peak of the crisis , between may and august 2011 , famine and severe food insecurity claimed some 30,000 lives a month , the report said			1
the @entity17 has been working with its humanitarian partners to change the way they operate , @entity10 said			1
some 2.7 million people in @entity1 are still in need of life - saving assistance			2
opinion : why @entity66 should care about famine in @entity68 " our aim is to ensure that @entity1 never goes through another famine again , " he said			2
' catastrophic shocks ' several factors led to the crisis , according to the report			2
first , the year from july 2010 to june 2011 was the driest in the eastern @entity68 in 60 years			2
this resulted in the death of livestock , small harvests and a big drop in demand for labor , cutting into household incomes			0
@entity1 also received less humanitarian assistance in 2010 and much of 2011 than it had in previous years , particularly 2008 to 2009 , the report said			1
in many areas , conflict and security concerns -- prompted by the activities of @entity91 - linked @entity90 group @entity89 -- hindered humanitarian aid and access			0
and with reduced supplies available , the price of food staples soared , putting more pressure on poor households			0
" for millions of @entity12 , already weakened by chronic food insecurity and persistently high levels of acute malnutrition , the shocks were catastrophic , " said the report			0
the result was what the researchers say was one of the worst famines in the past 25 years			0
their estimate of the number of people who died from the famine -- on top of those who died as a result of conflict or other causes -- was calculated using a range of information , including mortality surveys and data on food prices and wages			1
" we now have a picture of the true enormity of this human tragedy , '' said @entity124 , a senior economist for the @entity17			0
" lessons drawn from this experience will help the international community , together with the people of the region , build a stronger and more resilient future			0
" ' political failures ' international humanitarian organization @entity136 said thursday that the mistakes made in @entity1 in 2011 must never be repeated			1
" famines are not natural phenomena , they are catastrophic political failures , " it said in a statement			0
" the world was too slow to respond to stark warnings of drought , exacerbated by conflict in @entity1 , and people paid with their lives			0
these deaths could and should have been prevented , and such a shocking death toll must never be allowed to happen again			2
" world leaders meeting in @entity153 next week to discuss the situation in @entity1 " must take steps to ensure that this was @entity1 's last famine , " @entity136 said			1
this means investing in long - term development , creating jobs , supporting farmers and pastoralists , and ensuring properly trained security forces to help achieve the " just and sustainable peace " the country so badly needs , it said			0
@entity1 has lacked an effective central government since 1991 , with portions of the @entity68 nation left lawless			0
its shaky transitional government , backed by @entity170 peacekeepers , has been battling @entity90 guerrillas for years			0
