@entity0 , @entity1 -- an @entity1 state police forensic expert who carried out the initial dna examination presented at @entity6 's trial defended the methods used in an appeal hearing tuesday			1
the questions put to @entity10 focused on a key piece of evidence -- a clasp on a bra belonging to murdered @entity17 student @entity15			1
the defense team is seeking to demonstrate that dna evidence used in @entity21 's original trial is not conclusive as she appeals her conviction and 26 - year sentence for the 2007 murder of her housemate			1
two new forensic experts , professors @entity28 and @entity30 , cast doubt this summer on the dna evidence that played a role in the convictions of @entity21 and ex-boyfriend @entity35 in 2009			1
@entity28 and @entity30 said the clasp from @entity37 's bloodied bra , which allegedly contained @entity35 's dna , was " dirty " and had been allowed to rust , making further testing futile			1
the evidence , the two argued , should be " inadmissible			2
" but @entity10 defended the methods and equipment used in the investigation under questioning tuesday in a @entity0 court by prosecutor @entity46			0
@entity10 said the machine used for the @entity38 examination was clean -- and rejected suggestions the clasp had been contaminated			0
she said it had been moved but not turned over or stepped on at the scene			0
the hearing adjourned tuesday after highly technical and heated debate as @entity55 , a forensic expert for @entity35 's defense team , testified in support of the findings of @entity28 and @entity30			1
more argument over the dna evidence in the case is expected wednesday			1
but speaking outside court tuesday , prosecutor @entity46 said she considered that @entity10 and a prosecution forensic expert , @entity64 , had clearly proven the good work they had done			2
she suggested the prosecution team could ask for another @entity38 examination to be carried out			0
@entity69 , an attorney for @entity37 's family , echoed that message , saying the independent forensic team could have done more tests if they had doubts about the dna evidence			1
earlier , forensic expert @entity76 , used by the @entity37 family 's attorney , questioned in her testimony why the independent experts had not tested the small amount of @entity38 material found on another key piece of evidence -- a knife from @entity35 's home that prosecutors in 2009 said had traces of @entity21 's genetic material on the handle and @entity37 's in a tiny groove on the blade			1
@entity28 testified in earlier hearings that the knife tested negative for blood and the amount of @entity38 said to be @entity37 's was so low , it could not be examined again with any conclusions			0
but @entity76 said tuesday she had witnessed the work of @entity28 and @entity30 , and that the machinery they used during their investigation could check extremely low quantities of @entity38			0
meanwhile , @entity64 told the court that for him , and others , it was not a question of " quantity of dna , but rather quality " to carry out a successful examination			0
@entity28 and @entity30 have said records about the machine that did the dna testing were missing , suggesting the testing process may have been unreliable			1
on monday , the prosecutor said the records had been found and asked the judge to admit them as evidence			2
the defense argued they should not be admitted because they were not in the files originally given to the new experts			2
@entity46 said @entity28 and @entity30 could have had them if they had asked for them			0
@entity21 's father , @entity126 , told reporters outside court monday that he believed the independent experts " have done a very good job in evaluating the information ... and i do n't see it breaking down at this point			0
i see that it has been good for @entity6			2
" @entity2 's @entity134 contributed to this report .			0
