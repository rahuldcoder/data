-- in the world of golf , the next generation of stars just keeps on getting younger			2
ever since @entity6 blazed a trail by entering the 1959 @entity9 women 's open at the age of 14 , the sport has been a playground for many a young pretender			2
@entity13 was the latest child prodigy to rewrite the record books in may when she became the youngest player to ever qualify for the @entity17 , aged just 11 , although she failed to make the cut at last month 's event			1
the men 's game is in similar rude health			2
@entity23 became the youngest player to make the cut in a major championship following his appearance as a 14 - year - old at the 2013 masters , while @entity29 nearly became the youngest player to win that tournament in april at the age of 20			1
" we are encountering them more often			2
they are exceptionally mature guys for their age , " former teen prodigy @entity34 told @entity0 of the young players coming through the ranks			1
" they are extremely powerful guys that can perform extremely well			2
they have the confidence and the freedom of being young to perform against their idols			2
" @entity34 , now a seasoned tour pro at the age of just 21 , speaks from experience			1
the @entity49 was the most successful teenager in @entity52 history and remains the youngest player to win one of its events			1
at the age of 17 years and 188 days -- before he had even learned how to drive a car -- he triumphed at the 2010 @entity59 , and has since backed that up with three more @entity52 wins , including the flagship @entity61 at @entity62 in 2013			1
before @entity23 , @entity34 was the youngest player to make the cut at the masters , aged 16 in 2010 -- his 36th - place finish at @entity66 ranked as the best performance by a @entity69 amateur for 73 years			1
" i can certainly speak for @entity70 and he was extremely mature , " @entity34 said			1
" you can just see the way he was at @entity66			0
aged 14 and he knew what he wanted to do , he knew where he wanted to hit it , he knew how far ... at 14 that 's certainly exceptional			0
" @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 are just a few of golf 's child prodigies			0
each of the quintet made their own piece of history while still on the amateur circuit -- something @entity34 views as essential in the process of fast - tracking youngsters to global golfing fame			1
" i think amateur golf is one important key aspect of this and i am sure that young guys 15 years ago , they were totally able even at 17 to play with the pros , but they just probably did n't really know that they could , " he says			2
after becoming the youngest winner of the @entity101 in 2009 , @entity34 went on to place 13th at that year 's @entity102 , earning himself the @entity103 for the leading non-pro in the process			1
" amateur golf , from my point of view , made me believe that i could compete at any level because it was really , really competitive , " he says			0
" you know , we were winning tournaments and seeing golf courses in which they also played @entity69 tournaments			0
" the standard is really , really high , it is very competitive			0
i was playing all over @entity69 , i was playing in @entity9 too when i was 15 , 16 as an amateur , so it was really almost like being a professional			0
the only difference was school			0
" @entity34 turned professional in may 2010 -- two weeks after his 17th birthday -- to become the second youngest member in @entity52 history after @entity127			1
he had to wait just five months before his first win on the tour , and he credits the likes of @entity131 , who also made a successful transition upon turning professional , with helping him to that maiden triumph in @entity134			1
" you get a lot of confidence from playing with great players , with tough opponents			0
once i turned pro and i started doing well , i saw @entity131 a little before me , a few years before me , " he says			0
" it inspires you and gives you confidence and makes you think that you can do it too			0
professional golf is really tough , but once you 're in it you can do it even if you are young			2
" in golfing terms , @entity34 is still a baby with a long career lying ahead of him			1
and despite his recent frustrations , including a 118th - place finish in his @entity61 title defense -- won by @entity131 in may -- his enthusiasm for the sport remains the same as when he was teeing up at @entity66 for the first time with the eyes of the world upon him			0
" it 's not been a fantastic period lately but i am still enjoying it , the days that i go out and shoot a big score , i am having a lot of fun , " @entity34 says			1
" in general , when i am at a tournament that is the place i want to be			0
i would n't want to be anywhere else			0
until i 'm going to feel different , it 's going to be fine , it 's going to be great			0

@entity34 is encouraged by the number of young golfers coming through
@entity34 is the youngest player ever to win an event on the @entity52
the @entity49 is targeting his first win since the @entity173 triumph in 2013
