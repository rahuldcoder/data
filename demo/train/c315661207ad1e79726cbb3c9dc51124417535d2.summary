@entity0 -- former sen. @entity2 knew her window to run for president had closed			0
that moment passed when then - gov. @entity7 , a fellow @entity9 @entity8 , ran for and won the presidency in 2000 and served two terms , the lawmaker told @entity1			2
she was a senator with aspirations to a higher office who was also in the process of adopting two children			0
" the timing was n't right for me			0
even if he served four years , then maybe			0
but eight years and @entity9 fatigue			0
then i had children , so ... , " she said , her voice trailing off			0
wednesday marks the 95th anniversary of @entity25 ' approval of the 19th amendment to the @entity27 , guaranteeing women the right to vote			2
but all these years later , no woman has ever been named a major party 's presidential nominee			1
the path to the presidency is especially challenging for @entity8 women and it contrasts sharply with @entity36 who -- as buzz grows around @entity38 -- may be poised to nominate the first female presidential candidate of either major party			1
primary problems : @entity8 women struggle to come out on top four of the five women who are currently governors are @entity8 , and four of the past six presidents previously were governors			1
still , @entity8 women 's names are seldom mentioned among top - tier potential presidential hopefuls for 2016			1
sure , nods are given to retiring @entity56 rep. @entity55 's failed 2012 presidential bid			2
and there 's a perennial hope among some conservatives that former secretary of state @entity60 will run , though she 's said she has no interest in the position			2
but when mention is made of gov. @entity66 of @entity67 , gov. @entity68 of @entity69 , or @entity71 sen. @entity70 , it 's often couched as " she would make such a good running mate , " not in a way that is on par with male candidates , former sen. @entity77 , @entity78 , told @entity1			2
" women should naturally be considered for the highest office in the land , " @entity77 said			0
" the bench is too small " @entity36 women in @entity25 far outnumber @entity8 -- 16 - 4 in the 100 - seat @entity84 and 62 - 17 in the 435 - seat @entity85			1
in each of the past 10 election cycles , @entity8 women have won a smaller percentage of primary elections for @entity85 seats than have their @entity36 counterparts , according to a study by @entity93 's @entity92 , and only twice -- in 1994 and 2010 -- have more @entity8 than @entity36 women run in primaries			1
" it 's the concept of the pipeline			0
if the women are n't in the offices we draw on for the presidency , the bench is too small to choose from , " said @entity98 , director of the @entity93 center			2
even when they do seek office , studies have shown that conservative women in particular have had a tougher time getting the networking and financial support -- either from within the party or from outside groups -- needed to mount successful bids , @entity98 said			1
while there are a number of well - heeled groups , such as @entity119 , which back candidates with progressive stances , there are fewer such groups targeting conservative women , the @entity93 study found			1
@entity124 , the political action committee of former @entity126 governor and 2008 @entity8 vice presidential candidate @entity127 , has supported a number of conservative women candidates , including @entity71 's @entity70 in 2010			1
this year , the @entity130 is supporting @entity131 , a @entity84 candidate from @entity132 who won her primary on tuesday , among other women			0
@entity135 , another conservative women 's group , is supporting @entity138 , the former mayor of @entity139 , @entity140 , in her second bid for the @entity85			1
love narrowly lost in 2012 to incumbent @entity143 , who is not seeking re-election			0
the group is also supporting @entity146 , an @entity147 physician running for @entity84 , among other candidates			0
both @entity142 and @entity146 won their primaries			0
@entity1 poll : majority say @entity8 out of touch with women the other challenge female candidates to federal office face is an " ideological shift to the far right among the @entity8 primary electorate , " the study found			1
this shift has meant @entity8 women who might be moderate on such issues as abortion rights are less likely to survive primary fights in conservative districts			1
the results : fewer @entity8 women headed to @entity25 and a shallower pool of presidential contenders down the road			1
the @entity8 is keenly aware of its problems in both recruiting and supporting female candidates and attracting women voters			1
the party performed an autopsy of sorts after huge losses among women , minorities and young voters in the 2012 presidential election			2
@entity8 's soul - searching leads conflicted party to double down the party concluded it needed to beef up its outreach operations and has spent millions on efforts such as @entity186 , which seeks to identify and support more female candidates for the midterm elections , and " 14 in 14 , " a program aimed at wooing more women voters in key states			1
" we 've come together with the other @entity8 campaign committees ... to set up programs to get more women involved in our party , " said @entity192 , a spokeswoman for the @entity193			1
" we 've done things like recruit more women operatives to be involved and have a seat at the table with candidates , message - training and specific voter contact efforts			2
" the proof is in the numbers but some senior @entity8 women say that despite plenty of lip service paid to elevating women within the party , representation at the federal level is paltry , and the performance trend in primaries shows fewer @entity8 women are winning in those races than just two decades ago			1
" it 's unfortunate that there 's this attitude and perception within the @entity8 that are more aspirational when it comes to women , " @entity77 said			1
" the @entity8 has n't done the groundwork to build a strong bench of @entity8 women to launch a presidential candidacy			1
" " women have to put a step forward " as well , @entity77 said , to better ensure that they are in the running for the nation 's top political post			2
@entity84 balance of power could shift on women candidates however , doing so involves tough choices , @entity2 said			0
" we do end up with a great amount of responsibility for our families			0
being out campaigning for weeks and months at a time is difficult			0
the women in the @entity84 struggle with this , with questions of , ' do you move your children to be with you , or do you leave them back home ? ' " @entity2 said			0
" that makes it harder for us to say , ' yes , i 'm going to run for president and go to @entity71 , @entity132 , and @entity67 for weeks on end ' -- especially if they are in office already and away from their families			0
to add that to it is very difficult			0
" " whereas , no matter what we say , men have wives and they can leave more easily , " she said			0
though they may disagree with her political views , @entity8 women often give @entity38 kudos for her political skill			1
" @entity8 women have to do what @entity38 is doing			1
we have to steal the playbook of what she is doing , " said @entity267 , an editor and blogger with @entity269			0
winning requires building strong coalitions , fundraising and surrogates , @entity274 said			0
" look at what @entity38 has done in each campaign she has run			0
... she 's a good example of a case study for how women should model their efforts for running for office			2

so far , there are no women 's names on the @entity8 's 2016 presidential short list
there are more @entity8 women governors , but fewer *congresswomen* than *democrats*
