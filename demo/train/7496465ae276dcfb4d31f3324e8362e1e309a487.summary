scientists are normally a pretty measured bunch			2
but in recent months , they 've been resorting to some unusual language to get our attention			2
one top climatologist recently tweeted : " if even a small fraction of @entity8 sea floor carbon is released to the atmosphere , we 're f 'd			2
" when scientists start swearing in public , it is time for everyone to start worrying			2
it 's not just the scientists that are raising the alarm			1
this sunday , hundreds of thousands of people are taking to the streets around the world in the largest climate mobilization in history			1
if they were n't listening before , our leaders should tune in now			2
the voice of global concern for action on climate change is back , and this time it 's no longer an environmental issue , it 's an everybody issue			1
the world is rushing towards a series of potentially catastrophic feedback loops and tipping points in the climate system , which could see the support system of life itself irrecoverably disrupted			1
from the release of gigantic amounts of arctic methane gas , to the rapid carbon acidification of our oceans , to apocalyptic flooding , the continued warming of our planet is the greatest challenge our species has faced			1
the stakes seem too gargantuan to grasp , but it 's this leap in consciousness that 's required for our survival			1
our civilization is built on a fragile , delicately interdependent , and unsustainable relationship with the natural world			1
we ca n't afford to underestimate the massive footprint that humans have on this planet			2
one quarter of the carbon dioxide in our atmosphere came from our industries			0
our oceans are acidifying 10 times faster than at any point in earth 's history			1
we are stretching the limits of this world			1
but none of this is grounds for despair			0
the solution to the nightmare of runaway climate change is crystal clear , and beautiful			1
we need to shift our societies and economies off dirty energy and on to 100 % clean , sustainable energy , within a generation			1
this goal is entirely achievable			0
already , 22 % of the world 's electricity comes from clean energy and the sector is growing fast -- we just need to put our foot on the accelerator			1
' i 'm on the front lines of this crisis ' getting to 100 % clean will require a massive battle against the oil and coal industry and their pocket politicians whose subsidies , profits and influence are all at stake			1
but this change is possible - we now have the alternative energy technology we need to replace fossil fuels			1
in may , @entity101 published a plan to get to 100 % clean by 2050 , at a cost of less than 20 euros per @entity101 per year			0
countries as diverse as @entity105 and @entity106 are already nearly at 100 % clean			0
even @entity107 , the world 's biggest carbon emitter , is rolling out renewables faster than anywhere else on @entity112			1
the question is not whether we will make this breakthrough , but whether we do so before it is too late			0
the clock is ticking , the increase in temperature rising steadily towards the 2 degrees celsius mark - the red line that both scientists and governments have said poses unacceptable risk of the unthinkable			0
and that is why the @entity126 's @entity125 is so critical			1
there is a gap between the speed of action our survival requires and the action our governments are taking			0
the street is how we close that gap , because politicians will move faster when people move them			1
most large - scale social change has been spurred by movements , from ending slavery to giving women the right to vote			0
saving ourselves by shifting our societies to 100 % clean energy will require one of the largest , most diverse , and most sustained movements we 've ever seen			1
on sunday , that movement will step forward			2
a new cast of characters in an unprecedentedly broad coalition and cross section of society will take to the street			0
climate change has gone beyond environmentalism , it 's now about the economy , jobs , justice , family , security			1
it 's about the survival of everything we love			2
the @entity165 happening two days after the march is an opportunity to build momentum , no more			0
the @entity170 summit next year is when we 'll need our leaders to sign a new global agreement			0
if we learned one thing from the 2009 @entity176 summit , it 's that one global summit will never be a panacea			2
but the thud of peoples boots marching across the planet together with 130 leaders meeting to discuss a collective response to this crisis heralds a fresh momentum for the road ahead			0
even before the mobilization has happened , political leaders are responding to it			0
some are even joining the march			0
in the final analysis , the question is whether we human beings are capable of being wise , farsighted , and unified enough to pass this test of survival			0
many civilizations have fallen to the consequences of outstripping their environments			0
but our civilization is the first truly global one , with the power to end human life			0
one way or another , we may be the last civilization			0
for the sake of our children and their children , we must find the hope , wisdom and unity to save it			0

people 's @entity125 takes place sunday in cities around the world
@entity225 : @entity112 is rushing towards a series of potentially catastrophic tipping points on climate
@entity225 : we need to shift societies off oil and gas energy and onto renewable energy in a generation
