-- @entity0 asked readers to share their experiences with sexual harassment on the street in the comments section of a recent article titled ' hey baby ! women speak out against street harassment			1
' there was passionate debate about the causes and effects of catcalls , vulgar rants and even physical assault aimed at women			1
a few themes stood out : who 's to blame ? are women complicit in street harassment ? is it even worth talking about ? commenter @entity24 saw the issue of street harassment as cultural : " instead of blaming men , i would suggest that our larger culture might be more responsible for this			1
many people rely on instilling fear for advantage			2
popular gangster culture is widely accepted by @entity37 youth , and fear is a powerful intoxicant for predators			2
ladies , consider yourself fortunate that many such comments are camouflaged in sexual context			2
these same men are often abusive to everyone , their family members and even other men			1
violence , manipulation , deceit and controlling behaviors are often their modus operandi			2
also , remember women are not exempt from these trait , they are just manifest different			1
" @entity55 agreed : " much of rap music encourages this behavior			1
the songs are incredibly degrading to women			1
they are full of profanity and explicit sexual lyrics			2
there needs to be a public outcry against singers who promote this type of behavior and attitude			1
i urge people to read the lyrics of the music they listen to and not buy or support music with irresponsible messages			2
those of you with daughters , remember that every woman used to be somebody 's little girl			2
how would you feel if your little girl was treated this way			0
" yet some commenters said women condone street harassment with their response to it			1
@entity92 : " i never catcall a girl , honk a horn , or whistle at a woman			0
... the rejection is too overwhelming to take that risk			0
... but what 's ironic about all of this is that the type of men who do catcall are the @entity101 type of men that women flock to when they 're at the club			1
... i ca n't tell you how many times i 've seen a woman hypnotized by the biggest d0uch3bag on the dance floor			0
... " @entity127 : " it 's also interesting to see that some guy can literally be a stalker but it 's cool if the girl is into him but then you can have some poor , somewhat less attractive guy simply say hello to a girl , get viciously rejected and then hear the girls talking trash about the creepy freak stalker who dared to say hello to one of them ( despite the fact that the poor dude never bothered them before or again )			0
... you are not helping your cause for the very , very few guys who are actually dangerous ( which is very few , even 99.9 % of jerks are not )			0
... " @entity134 wrote in response to @entity136 : " he nailed it 100 %			0
do n't lie to us			0
girls talk a good game and then they go out with the worst of the catcallers and call it ' manly ' , brutish ' , ' alpha male ' ' he is not that bad really '			1
i do n't mind it if that is how things are and adjust accordingly but lets not lie about it			0
... " then there were the men who were shocked that so many other men condoned catcalling in the comment thread			1
@entity154 : " as a man , i never realized there were so many other men that actually think it is ok to catcall and harass women			1
did n't the rest of you men have mothers that taught you this was wrong ? what is wrong with you guys			1
i thought this was only a small segment of men out there but it looks like from the comments it is at least half			1
this is wrong and you men that do this are cowards			1
get it ? cowards ! wake up and start treating women the way you would want men to treat your daughter if she was walking on the street or in a subway			1
" @entity188 seemed to agree : " this is n't a women 's problem			1
this is a men 's problem			1
we as men must be willing to stand up and speak up for our daughters , sisters and mothers			1
" as did @entity196 : " if a woman dresses in provocative clothes and literally wears a sign reading ' please harass me , ' it is still the man 's responsibility to exercise self - restraint			0
a man is just that -- a man , not an impulsive child			0
" there were also some readers who thought the issue was being exaggerated : @entity214 : " many of us are n't condoning the behavior , we just find the response to it overblown			1
i do n't condone bullying either , but i 'm sick to death of the media latching on to it and creating an atmosphere of hypersensitivity			0
kids will always pick on each other , it is n't a national crisis			0
there will always be men who say crude things , it is n't terrorism or rape			1
some of us are just getting sick of extreme cases being presented as if they are indicative of the norm			0
kids are n't lining up like lemmings to commit suicide because some other kid gave them a wedgie , and people are n't getting raped and groped en masse on public transit because we let construction workers get away with whistling at pretty women			1
this type of sensationalism will produce a backlash , hence the crude jokes people are making here			0
most of us are n't defending the behavior , we 're ridiculing the response			0
" @entity254 did n't agree : " @entity255 , i agree the media over sensationalizes things , but cases like this -- unwanted touching on the bus , graphic threats to rape , following someone home etc ? it 's happened to every girl			0
i 'm glad we are discussing it , because it seems like guys have no idea that this is so frequent and do n't realize * why * we 're responding to them with distrust and fear			1
" @entity273 had some advice for women : " you mean men are still carrying on like that ? i thought they 'd stopped years ago			1
when did i grow old enough to fly beneath the radar ? take it from me , ladies , ' this , too , shall pass			0
' enjoy every minute of being young and beautiful and do n't waste your precious moments getting hung up on the small stuff			0
@entity288 whistles are small stuff			0
" @entity291 also said women should just suck it up : " this behavior is genetic , and all of you people who are arguing against it simply lack a grasp of human nature			2
men will forever be trying to get some , and women will forever be the object of that desire			1
it is inherent in our nature			0
while i agree that sometimes it goes too far , trying to regulate human chemistry is a short trip down the road to fascism			0
i 'm sorry if it bothers you when men recognize that you look great in ways that you do n't approve of			2
stop trying to control things you have no right to control			0
if you want to be equals , then start growing a pair instead of whining about what you do n't like			0
" others did n't take so kindly to that response			0
@entity328 : " we have control over our own bodies			0
you have control over your actions			0
making lame excuses and saying that men are just animals who ca n't control themselves is pathetic and insulting to men			2
you can recognize a pretty girl without grabbing or harassing them , millions of men are capable of this			2
" commenter @entity343 summed up her history with street harassment : " i 've had multiple experiences during the years of this and similar experiences			2
whether walking down the street , riding public transit , walking in a park with my dog , being in a public space ( i.e. store , library , etc ) - and here 's my take on it at 56 years old			2
why do people think its ok to say something to another person that you would n't want said to your mother , your sister , your daughter or your friend ? why must we accommodate your inability to keep your thoughts from flowing freely and without consideration , from your mouths ? ... sadly its all too common that other women and men will not intervene or step up to assist others			1
they do n't want to get involved			0
i 'm frankly tired of accommodating other 's poor behavior and inability to control themselves in public			2

@entity0 commenters had strong opinions on why catcallers target women
some readers said men should address this problem among themselves
others said women play into harassment by responding *favorably* to " bad boys "
many agreed that greater respect for others in all spheres of public life is necessary
