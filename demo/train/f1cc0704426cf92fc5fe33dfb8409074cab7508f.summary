-- in rolling out its @entity2 on wednesday , @entity1 effectively launched the smartwatch wars , becoming the biggest player in an emerging gadget market that could soon see @entity6 , @entity7 and others join the fray			1
" today , @entity1 reinvents a centuries - old product , " @entity1 research director @entity10 said at a launch event in @entity12			1
" i can proudly say @entity2 is a design statement , an engineering marvel and something that really redefines tomorrow			1
" so , no false modesty here			0
but , what did everyone else have to say ? tech bloggers ' first impressions of the watch , which will go on sale in late september in much of the world and in october in the @entity24 and @entity25 , were predictably less grandiose than that			1
many complimented the @entity28 as a significant step forward in mobile technology with a host of interesting features and the potential for even more			1
but its $ 299 price tag was a concern for many , as were worries that sluggish responses on some apps will turn out to be a persistent problem , not a case of opening - day jitters			1
others complained the watch must be synced with a @entity46 phone or tablet to get the most out of its functionality			2
we 've rounded up some thoughts from folks who got an early look at the connected watch , which will compete against rival devices from @entity56 , @entity57 and other makers			2
keep in mind that many of them had limited time with the device and some will publish more in - depth reviews later			0
consumer reports " we like what we saw in a brief meeting with @entity1 , though the @entity2 had several shortcomings , such as no direct support ( yet ) for @entity73 or @entity74 and a display that stays on only briefly with each press of the power button , " reviewer @entity66 wrote after a short hands - on with the device			1
the full @entity65 review will come later			0
" the @entity2 ... appears to be one of the most useful devices to adorn the wrist since the wristwatch			2
but its expected initial high price could limit its appeal to early adopters with deep pockets			2
" the verge " the @entity2 , @entity1 's latest foray into the smartwatch category , is now official and it 's quite unlike anything you 've seen before , " wrote @entity87			1
" yes , it 's a smartphone accessory that can pick up notifications , control music playback , and keep time with a rich variety of watch faces , but @entity1 takes it a few steps further by integrating a 1.9 - megapixel camera , a speaker , and two microphones â € ” allowing you to shoot short 720p movies and even conduct phone calls with the @entity2 ...			1
" @entity105 , however , i find it hard to justify spending the $ 299 asking price on an accessory like the @entity2			1
it 's too dependent on its parent device for functionality â € ” which will cost you a fair amount too â € ” and , like all other smartwatches , fails to truly live up to the '' smart ' part of its name			2
" @entity119 in a piece titled " your turn , @entity6 , " @entity120 wrote he 's intrigued , even though @entity1 tends to release imperfect products , then improve them			1
" the @entity2 watch seems to hit most checkboxes			1
the watch 's design is fashion - forward without being completely nerdy			1
it 's available in a wide range of colors			0
and it packs a good amount of tech including a camera into a modest - sized frame			0
it 's open to applications and there 's even a camera in the wrist band , because why not			0
and you can actually take calls on the thing by holding it up to your ear			0
" " should you buy the @entity2 ? nah , wait for the next one			2
that 's what i 'm going to do			0
a @entity56 is good enough for me until then			0
but i still want this one			0
" @entity155 " wrist watches , smart or otherwise , are simply not for everyone -- there are more smartphone users in the world , many times over , than there will ever be smartwatch owners			0
despite the limited market for such a device , however , @entity1 's decided it 's time to join in on the fun			1
" the @entity28 includes ... a @entity168 sensor and autofocus lens mounted in the wrist strap ...			0
that camera , designed for on - the - go captures where convenience , not image quality , is a priority , is paired with a pre-installed app called @entity177			0
that application , and dozens of others that will be available at launch , are key to boosting the @entity28 's appeal , and setting it apart from the competition			0
" @entity183 " on first use , @entity2 seems pretty responsive			2
it swipes quickly and smoothly between apps , " wrote @entity185			0
" we were n't able to test out texting , but we started a call that popped right up on the screen of the @entity191 , more speedily than anticipated			0
overall , @entity2 feels kind of awkward both to wear ( it 's chunky ) and to use ( it 's unnatural , although that 's to be expected since it 's a new type of input )			1
all that could be worth it , though , ( if ) the fitness apps ( which we were n't able to test ) are killer , and if moving between your @entity46 smartphone and your watch are as seamless as it seemed to be in our test			2

@entity1 *introduces* @entity2 smartwatch

some *critics* worry its price , sluggish apps may *dampen* sales
