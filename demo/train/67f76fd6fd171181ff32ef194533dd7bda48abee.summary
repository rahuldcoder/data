-- @entity1 has spent her whole life going where no one has gone before , and at 81 she 's still as sassy and straight - talking as you 'd expect from an interstellar explorer			1
" i do n't have enough sense to keep my mouth shut , " says the legendary @entity8 actor with a hearty laugh			1
" whatever comes up , comes out			2
" " i ca n't help myself			2
" as the startlingly beautiful and fiercely intelligent @entity14 on the hit 1960s tv series , @entity1 was a revolutionary figure at a time when the only @entity19 - @entity18 women you saw on @entity21 were usually playing servants			1
indeed , @entity8 was reportedly the only program @entity24 would let his children stay up late to watch			1
when @entity1 was considering leaving the show to pursue a career on @entity28 , @entity24 personally implored her to stay , saying she was a powerful role model for black people across the country -- and the world			1
" that was the greatest thing , " says @entity1			1
" that was greater than anything else , to be told that by dr. @entity36 , because he was my leader			2
" so i stayed and i never regretted it			2
" @entity39 ambassador as the original series drew to a close at the end of the decade , a real - life space race was gathering pace -- and this time it was @entity1 calling for auditions			1
the @entity18 landed a man on the moon in 1969 -- but our astronauts need n't be limited to white males , said @entity1			1
" there were no women , and there were no minorities in the space program -- and that 's supposed to represent the whole country ? " she says , her voice rising incredulously down the phone from her home in @entity63 , @entity64			2
" not in this day and age			0
we just absolutely can not have that			0
i ca n't be a part of that , " she said at the time			0
the glamorous sci - fi celebrity was soon enlisted by @entity39 to recruit the country 's first female and ethnic minority astronauts			1
she traveled the length and breadth of the @entity18 calling for promising astronauts to come forward -- among them was @entity79 , the first @entity18 woman in space , and @entity82 , the current @entity39 administrator			1
" as a matter of fact , @entity79 called me to tell me that i was the way she had heard about the space program , " says @entity1			1
" i was somewhat of a celebrity in their eyes			0
i had gone on television and in several interviews spoke of why they should get involved , and they took it up and said ' she 's absolutely right			0
' " the kiss @entity1 was n't just a tv celebrity -- she was a tv revolutionary , locking lips with @entity100 in one of the small screen 's first interracial kisses , in 1968			1
though at the time , she did n't quite see what all the fuss was about			0
" i come from an interracial family , and so it was kind of boring for me to be talking about something i experienced every day , " she says			2
" it was not new to me , because i lived it			0
" but i realized it was new on tv , and i had the opportunity to bring it to the world			2
" the scene -- in which @entity14 and @entity117 are controlled by humanoids who force them to embrace -- received a huge response from the public , largely positive			1
society today has much to learn from the crew living on board the " @entity126 " in the 23rd century , says @entity1			1
" @entity8 is about the freedom to be who you are , and be respected for who you are , " she says , her warm native @entity130 accent raspy round the edges			1
" it demands that you respect everyone else equally			0
it 's as simple as that			0
" stars in her eyes born in the small town of @entity143 , outside @entity144 , in 1932 , @entity1 came from a family that defied convention			1
her grandfather was a white southerner who married a black woman , and in doing so was ostracized by his wealthy parents			0
@entity1 ' father was a factory worker who also served as town mayor			1
a talented dancer and singer , @entity1 started performing @entity144 clubs at 14 , meeting one jazz legend who would change her life forever -- @entity158			1
" he was the greatest name in music , black or white or any other thing , " says @entity1			1
" everyone at every level had the greatest respect for him			0
" she later toured with the successful composer , despite other people 's reservations about what was expected of schoolgirls at the time			2
" you went to school and it was like ' girls did n't do that			0
' but i was like ' c'mon			0
' so i just jumped on this opportunity with both feet , " she says			0
enduring wonder of space as a child , @entity1 was also told that " girls were n't supposed to like science " -- not that she took much notice			1
" science is not a boy 's game , it 's not a girl 's game			0
it 's everyone 's game			0
it 's about where we are and where we 're going , " she says , and you can almost picture the serene figure of @entity14 in red uniform , speaking at the controls			2
" space travel benefits us here on @entity203			0
and we ai n't stopped yet			0
there 's more exploration to come			0
" it seems @entity8 's legendary communications officer has a real - life message for us all			2
