@entity0 -- a gun law passed by the @entity4 legislature more than a decade ago may be set into motion as tech savvy gun makers get closer to being able to sell so - called smart guns in the @entity8			1
the idea behind this firearms technology is to create " personalized " guns that only fire in the right hands -- whether by recognizing a certain signal from a watch , a ring or even just the right grip			1
the @entity4 law is the only one of its kind in the @entity8			1
it requires that within three years of the technology being available , only smart guns be sold in the state			1
the new technology has become one more point of contention in the gun debate , with gun - control supporters expecting it to lead to fewer injuries and deaths and the pro-gun side arguing that it will take away options from gun owners			1
" the problem is you have an industry that is totally reluctant to embrace any changes to make their products safer , " said @entity35 , communications director of the @entity37 - based @entity36			0
" the benefits of this technology should be obvious to anyone , " he said			0
" the key is implementation			0
it is going to take some political will			0
will you have a state government in @entity4 with the political will to see this through ? " the country 's largest gun advocacy organization , the @entity54 , did not respond to requests for comment			1
" @entity4 's smart - gun law is as dumb as it gets , " said @entity58 , executive director of the @entity59 , a group affiliated with the @entity54			1
" it forces you to use an unproven technology to defend your life , and then exempts the state from liability when the gun goes ' click ' instead of ' bang , ' " he said			2
" if it 's such a great idea , then law enforcement should n't be exempt , and the free market should be allowed to determine its viability			0
" one @entity75 - based company , @entity74 , which already sells personalized guns in @entity77 , expects to have its @entity79 digital pistol available on the nation 's shelves " within weeks , " according to @entity82 , president and ceo			1
@entity84 uses radio frequency technology in its .22 - caliber digital pistol , which unlocks with a digital watch and a pin			2
if someone who is n't wearing the watch grabs the gun , it immediately deactivates			2
" our digital pistol is the first of its kind and has gone through rigorous testing in @entity75 -- some of the highest standards -- and in the @entity8 , " @entity82 told @entity1			0
" anybody who picks up the handgun , whether it 's a child or it 's actively stolen , they ca n't activate the watch			0
" another firm , @entity103 of @entity104 , markets an " @entity105 , " which uses a fingerprint - based locking system			0
@entity107 , president of @entity103 , said the company began taking preorders in january			0
the personalized weapon will be in full production by the end of december			0
@entity84 , @entity103 and other smart - gun makers are poised to force acting @entity4 attorney general @entity115 , a @entity116 , to decide how to implement the law			1
@entity119 tests show 3 - d guns lethal as metal detection law expires for more than a decade , researchers at the @entity123 have been working on a grip - recognizing gun that measures the pressure applied and the size and shape of the hand holding the gun			1
@entity130 , which was founded by @entity132 entrepreneur @entity131 , also uses radio frequency technology to enable -- and disable -- guns			2
the chip that activates the gun can be placed in a ring , bracelet or potentially even embedded in the owner 's hand			2
so what does this mean for the law ? the state attorney general 's office declined to comment			0
under the law , @entity115 must determine whether the smart guns meet industry standards and are available for retail sale			1
the law says " personalized handguns shall be deemed to be available for retail sales purposes if at least one manufacturer has delivered at least one model of a personalized handgun to a registered or licensed wholesale or retail dealer in @entity4 or any other state			1
" @entity155 police raise spector of 3 - d printer - made guns the @entity159 then will issue a list of firearms that meet the technological standard			0
within three years of the guns hitting the market , they will be the only kinds of firearms sold in @entity4			1
in @entity4 , 2013 firearms background checks -- needed to obtain permits required to purchase handguns -- increased by more than 50 % through october , compared with the same period in 2012 , according to the @entity170			2
in the first 10 months of 2013 , 100,922 background checks were conducted , compared to 66,912 during the same period the year before			0
according to the latest data available from the @entity175 's @entity174 , there were 456 firearm related deaths in @entity4 in 2010			0
in august , @entity4 gov. @entity178 vetoed a bill that would ban certain long - range rifles and sent several gun - related bills back to the state legislature for changes , according to his office .			2

@entity4 law could take hold with new smart gun technology
" personalized " guns only fire with signal from watch , ring or the right grip
the law , the only one of its kind , has become part of national gun debate
