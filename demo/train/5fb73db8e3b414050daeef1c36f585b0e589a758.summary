@entity0 -- @entity2 harnessed the @entity4 reputation for elegance to become a global cosmetics giant -- and the company 's ceo says @entity10 economies should apply similar logic to escape their current woes			1
@entity13 , @entity2 's chair and chief executive , said @entity10 countries need to identify areas of expertise to succeed in the global marketplace -- just like companies			1
" you have to specialize yourself in some areas where you are going to be [ in ] the top league worldwide , " he said			0
@entity10 countries had great potential if they could only find their niche , he added			1
" @entity10 could be rich ( given ) the diversity of its countries , the diversity of its expertise , as long as each country is able to maximize its success , its potential in its own field			2
" @entity13 has worked for @entity2 since joining the company in 1978 , with stints heading its operations in @entity38 and @entity39 -- an experience he said had given him unusual insight into @entity10 's current predicament			1
" based on this experience , i can see that it is very difficult for these two countries to live under the same currency , " he said			0
