@entity0 -- thanks to sen. @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 can have their big inauguration date night after all			1
last week , the @entity9 - area couple , along with many others , were shut out of the first - come , first - served official presidential inaugural ball ticket sales when a mistake by @entity12 , the ticket vendor , inadvertently released tickets for both the inaugural ball and parade early , as @entity1 first reported			1
@entity12 and the @entity17 later apologized for the mix - up , but thousands of potential partygoers were upset and flocked to @entity21 and social media demanding a remedy			1
so the @entity23 -- who had planned on breaking out their finest formal outfits for monday night -- found themselves and their two kids headed to @entity0 with no ball tickets in hand			1
but after seeing their story on a @entity9 tv station friday morning , @entity29 , a @entity30 from @entity0 , came to the rescue			1
@entity29 called her office and told them to track the couple down			2
@entity38 party with 30,000 close friends " sen. @entity29 was touched by how much effort ( the @entity23 ) had made to try to go to the ball and felt ( terrible ) that even though they were online so early an error dashed their hopes , " @entity29 spokesman @entity40 told @entity1			1
" she told staff that she thought ' their enjoyment was the best use of my tickets			1
' " but @entity53 said the office had a hard time tracking them down in time since the family had already left for @entity0			0
finally , just hours before the big event , the office was able to locate her cell phone number and made the connection			0
the @entity23 , who planned the almost 2,800 - mile trip to @entity0 as a part of an educational experience for their two children , @entity67 , 14 and @entity68 , 11 , were touring the @entity69 on sunday when they got the call from @entity29 's office offering them the tickets			2
" we just walked across the street , " @entity5 said			0
the @entity74 , where @entity29 's office is located , is a couple of blocks from the @entity77 and a hop , skip and a jump from the @entity69			2
" they were so excited to give it to us			0
" @entity29 's office later tweeted a picture of the happy family			0
while @entity67 and @entity68 wo n't be attending the ball with their parents , they wo n't miss out on all of the fun			2
the whole family will attend the president @entity90 's second inauguration ceremony on the western front of the @entity77 , with tickets they secured from @entity77 rep. @entity94 , @entity95			0
with her gown secured , @entity53 , an @entity90 supporter , said she was most looking forward to the ball for " the energy			0
" " just being there and the energy of the day ... just to be a part of another celebration of @entity90 and of our country and not to be in my hotel room packing to go home			0
