late last winter , @entity2 was shaken first by a 8.8 - magnitude earthquake and , later , looting and military police hitting the streets			1
in august , the @entity8 mine collapsed , threatening the lives of 33 men trapped a half - mile underground and further testing the upstart @entity12 country 's psyche weeks ahead of its bicentennial commemoration			2
but this week , @entity2 came alive -- in the eyes of its citizens , as well as the world			2
@entity17 , which could have been the site of mass mourning had the miners ' rescue effort gone awry , instead became home to a patriotic festival			1
the strong national pride was omnipresent : from the red , white and blue @entity2 flags that permeated the rescue site to the chants that rang out as the miners rose to the surface			1
it was clear , too , many miles away -- whether it was the hugs and tears of joy among the throngs watching the scene on a flickering big - screen tv set up in a @entity48 city square , the champagne corks popping at the @entity2 embassy in @entity32 , or countless bite - sized conversations in the vast reaches of cyberspace where the @entity2 miners were a top trending discussion on @entity38			1
" what emotion ! what happiness ! what pride to be @entity2 ! " wrote @entity2 president @entity51 , on his own @entity38 page			2
like many emerging countries , @entity2 has not been without its challenges			2
it continues to emerge from the shadows of dictator @entity58 's rule from 1974 to 1990 , when up to 30,000 people vanished or were killed because of their political beliefs			0
economic disparities and political divisions still exist , with the global recession having a real impact in this @entity66 nation			0
yet , its past and recent challenges notwithstanding , @entity2 has also emerged as a model in @entity70 and the world , given its solid economic base and fervent democracy			0
" @entity2 is ... a country with really strong institutions , " said @entity74 , director of the @entity75 at the @entity76			2
" and it 's economy has done really well			0
" while it could have been a calamity , the @entity8 mine rescue effort instead turned into a celebration , not just of the miners ' survival but also the nation 's collective ability ( with help from international friends ) to safely extricate them			1
thus , this week 's rescue effort gave @entity2 a good reason and made - for - tv stage to show off their longstanding patriot fervor to the world			1
" @entity2 , in general , have a strong sense of national identity , " said @entity92 , director of the @entity94 's @entity93			1
" and with this episode , it 's like they did everything right			0
" since @entity58 , @entity2 has experienced significant economic growth and steady inroads combating corruption and poverty			0
but until now , @entity2 rarely had been front - and - center in most everyday discussions of @entity70 , which are more likely to be dominated by @entity107 's booming development , communist @entity108 , @entity111 's civil war and @entity112 under leftist leader @entity113			1
thus , while international policymakers and business leaders have seen ( and , in some cases , been party to ) its development , the mine collapse and rescue effort were many people 's first sustained exposure to @entity2 , its people and its potential			1
" @entity2 should be held up as a model , but it often is n't , " said @entity92			0
" i do n't know if ( the rescue ) changes the image of @entity2 , or it creates an image of @entity2			2
" led by president @entity51 , the rescue effort and @entity2 were very much intertwined			1
government officials frequently appeared before tv cameras , @entity2 flags abounded and patriotic chants rang out regularly			2
the loudest and emotional could be heard when the miners emerged : " chi ! chi ! chi ! le ! le ! le ! @entity136 de @entity2 ! " that was no accident , said @entity138 , a professor at @entity140 's @entity139 specializing in @entity2			1
@entity51 , who had seen his popularity drop since taking office last march , took control of the situation and played to the cameras , she said			0
@entity146 sprung up , as a temporary home to miners ' families as well as the scores of global media who descended on the scene			0
" they are so conscious that the world is watching , " said @entity138			0
" this is as genuinely @entity2 as @entity157 is genuinely @entity12			0
this is a tv show			0
" still , for all the production set - ups and political posturing , @entity138 said that @entity2 ' joy was true and widely felt			1
while the release came at a critical time for @entity2 , who wrestled with " soul - searching " after the quake and during the bicentennial commemoration , it reflected citizens ' deep - rooted sense that @entity2 is worth celebrating			1
and in @entity70 -- especially given @entity2 's rivalry with @entity66 neighbors @entity172 and @entity173 dating back to the 19th century @entity174 -- such self - congratulation among @entity2 is almost expected and sometimes resented			1
" i do n't think @entity2 suffer from an inferiority complex , " said @entity176 , a professor at @entity177 in @entity178			0
" in some sense , they have a superiority complex			0

experts say that @entity2 have long *boasted* a strong sense of national identity
the miners ' rescue effort is described as a made - for - tv production *showcasing* @entity2 *excellence* and pride
the rescue has been many people 's introduction to @entity2
