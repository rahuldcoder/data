" the last - minute statement by mr. @entity12 's representative put out late yesterday only confuses the issue , " she said			1
" instead of stating clearly that @entity30 will be allowed to compete , mr. @entity12 qualifies it by adding conditions that are ambiguous			1

" @entity20 did n't know it then , but @entity12 gave a clearer statement to @entity1 in @entity13 two hours earlier			2
" we went by the laws of @entity32 and the laws of the @entity95 , and those laws say that she should be allowed to enter the pageant , " @entity12 said			1
