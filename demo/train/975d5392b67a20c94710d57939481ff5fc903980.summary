-- it was late afternoon in @entity2 on july 17 when i spotted the tweet : a commercial airliner had been downed over eastern @entity6			1
my team , more than 250 civilians from the @entity8 , had been sent to @entity6 three months before to monitor and report on the security situation in the country and to facilitate dialogue			1
now we were involved in something very different			2
as the minutes ticked by , we raced to verify claims about the plane			1
soon it was confirmed : a @entity19 777 with 298 people aboard it had crashed			1
it was exactly 24 hours after @entity23 17 fell out of the heavens and into the farmlands of the @entity27 region when our team of two dozen monitors arrived on the scene			1
we knew we were close when we spotted from a distance the vertical tail , with the @entity35 logo still largely intact			2
it lay peacefully , seemingly untouched , in a wheat field			2
we were the first international organization on the ground , and with that came an intense , unprecedented media glare that would last for days			1
some referred to us as " the eyes and ears of the world " -- and what we saw was horrifying			2
our first observations were of a gruesome scene of smoldering rubble , bodies ( some still strapped into their seats ) , personal belongings and a bewildered group of swaggering rebels , uniformed first responders and foreign journalists			1
there was no sign of perimeter security			0
aside from the vertical tail , the aft section of the fuselage was among the largest , intact pieces of debris			0
on the opposite side of a farm road that bisected the main impact site were more terrible scenes : mangled corpses amid still - smoldering fuselage , duty free shopping bags and open suitcases			1
farther along the hellish landscape was where the wings , fuel tanks , landing gear and main cabin crashed			1
the impact of the jet smashing into the ground caused a fireball in one field that brought temperatures as high as 1,600 degrees @entity85 , according to some experts -- enough to melt the aluminum wings of the 17 - year - old aircraft and incinerate everything in the immediate area			1
incredibly , the small village of @entity92 , just a few meters away , remained relatively untouched			0
on @entity94 , we were only able to spend 75 minutes on the site			0
the heavily armed rebel who appeared to be in charge was largely uncooperative and clearly unhappy with our presence there			0
he was aggressive and appeared to be intoxicated			0
journalists on the scene told us that they had been hastily corralled , apparently to create a semblance of order			2
there were many scenes that defied logic : an opened bag of duty free items with two plastic , un-pilfered bottles of whiskey , a @entity113 laptop , a @entity115 guidebook to @entity116 -- not a surprising find given that this " backpacker route " is heavily used by holidaymakers destined for @entity118			0
a few days later we 'd find several passports that had been taken away and then put back at the crash site , apparently by a guilt - ridden first responder			0
what also struck us was the randomness of how pieces of the plane fell upon this bucolic region of conflict - ridden eastern @entity6 : a toilet sink here , a business class seat a few meters away and next to it the horizontal stabilizers			1
we were shocked one day to chance upon an enormous piece of the main passenger cabin , hidden away in the woods			0
i counted 17 windows , some of them still intact			2
by far the most horrific scene was four days after the crash , when our team monitored the sealing up of train cars filled with the remains of the plane 's passengers , at the railway station in @entity151 ( which , ironically , was where four of our colleagues were kidnapped by an armed group at the end of may )			1
the stench of death at the station was overwhelming			0
yet knowing that these souls were finally on their way home , out of this chaotic scene to a place where they could be cared for with dignity , provided some sense of comfort			1
i noted how the local women from the railway station took great pains to meticulously seal the car doors -- perhaps feeling in some small way that they had aided the families of the victims			0
it was during these first crucial days that our team was able to facilitate access for four small groups of experts : a team of civil aviation experts from @entity2 , a three - member team from @entity35 and that country 's department of civil aviation , along with @entity187 and @entity188 experts			2
i marveled particularly at the stoicism and composure of the @entity192 experts : these are men who live and breathe aviation , and they knew the aircraft intimately			0
the tragedy struck deeply for me as well			0
i had lived and worked for many years in @entity23 , have many friends there and am very familiar with the country and the airline			1
my roots are in @entity6 , and i 've covered commercial aviation as a journalist and i 've a well - known fondness for flying			1
at least at the end of every day , we were able to retreat to the relative comfort of our hotel in @entity209			2
but even there , the threat of violence was never far off			0
late one night , standing on the hotel rooftop waiting to go live on tv with @entity0 's @entity215 , the sound of automatic gunfire sent me and the @entity219 crew rushing for cover			0
i ended up speaking to @entity215 crouched down near a protective wall			0
on august 1 , after almost a week - long pause due to security reasons , we were able to establish a new access route that paved the way for daily visits by a critical mass of @entity187 and @entity188 experts to the @entity230 crash site			0
to finally see dozens of trained sets of eyes combing over the site , starting with the chicken farm near @entity92 , brought us all a sense of accomplishment			1
as images of the uniformed experts surveying the fields , aided by sniffer dogs , were flashed around the word by the media and via social media , i thought to myself that this must have brought some sense of comfort to the families of the victims			1
and after days of waiting in @entity27 , i know that the @entity187 and @entity188 experts -- despite the grim task ahead of looking for victims ' remains and personal belongings , as well as the dangers of working a crime scene in the midst of an active conflict zone -- could not wait to get down to work			2
the sounds of shelling in the distance were a constant reminder of the threat			0
little wonder that during an orientation session , one of the commanders instructed the experts to " treat every day here as if it is your last day on site			0
" i am often asked how we coped with the enormity of all this , of the horrific scenes we witnessed			0
what powered us through this was knowing that we were providing families with crucial bits of information in those chaotic first days			2
as always , our hearts and prayers are with the victims ' loved ones , and we hope that we have been able to provide them with some sense of comfort and closure to this horrific tragedy			1
@entity230 victims ' bodies flown home to @entity23 mother of two @entity230 victims regrets not heeding son 's fears			1

@entity23 17 crashed in @entity6 on july 17 , killing all 298 passengers
@entity299 was part of first international team of observers on scene
@entity299 : we saw smoldering rubble of plane with bodies still strapped into their seats
@entity299 : knowing these souls were finally on their way provided some sense of comfort
