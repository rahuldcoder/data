@entity1 , @entity0 -- the last living survivor of the @entity4 earned only a small fraction of what auctioneers hoped to raise when she sold her final remaining mementos of the doomed ship to pay nursing home bills			1
@entity11 , 97 , was trying to raise money so she can stay in the nursing home she prefers			1
the 17 items belonging to 97 - year - old @entity11 sold for about $ 8,000 on saturday , according to auctioneer @entity15 -- not enough to pay for two months at her nursing home			1
@entity15 had earlier speculated the sale could raise up to $ 50,000 for her			1
but the bidder who bought the @entity22 item with the closest connection to the doomed voyage returned it to her after the sale , @entity15 said			2
" a young man bought the canvas bag for £ 1,500 ( $ 2,200 ) and donated it back to @entity11 , " @entity15 said			1
he did not reveal the buyer 's identity			2
the canvas bag might have been used to lift the infant @entity22 from a lifeboat to a rescue ship , @entity15 said			2
" historical documents say she was lifted from the lifeboat onto @entity36 , the rescue ship , in a mail sack , " @entity15 said			2
after her rescue , @entity22 , her mother and brother returned to @entity0 with a canvas sack , among other possessions			0
" there is speculation that this would have been the bag			0
it 's a leather and canvas bag			0
you would easily get a child or infant in it , " @entity15 said , though he added that research by the @entity53 , the @entity54 and the @entity55 showed no proof that @entity22 had been taken off the lifeboat in that particular bag			0
it was the second auction in less than a year at @entity60 for @entity22 , who was a 9 - week - old baby when the ship sank on its maiden voyage in 1912			1
@entity15 said before the sale he was eager to raise as much for @entity22 as possible			2
" she 's in a residential nursing home			1
she 's 97 years of age			2
she 's paying £ 3,000 a month in nursing home fees , " he said			1
" as she said , £ 3,000 a month is £ 36,000 a year , which is a lot of money , " he said			2
" when she runs out of money , the state will pay fees for her , but while she can pay her fees , she decides where she gets her care			0
when the state pays , they decide			0
" @entity22 's previous sale , in october , raised just over £ 30,000 , @entity15 said			0
" it 's made a lot of people aware of her plight , a lot of people have sent her funds , " he said			0
@entity22 never married and had no children			0
" there are cousins but there is no one directly to support her , " @entity15 said			0
" the property she lived in ( before she moved to the nursing home ) was not hers			1
she 's just an ordinary little old lady			0
" if she 's lucky , she 'll get another four or five years , she 's quite a fit lady , " he said			0
@entity22 was not available to speak to @entity2 herself because of a throat infection , @entity15 said			0
the auction included 17 items from her collection -- most of them memorabilia related to the @entity4 and signed by her , but not from the ship itself			1
the auction , in @entity110 , southwest @entity0 , also included letters from the estate of @entity4 survivor @entity113 which fetched more than $ 36,000			1
one letter sold for about $ 21,800 , while two others went for about $ 5,800 and just over $ 10,000 , @entity15 said			1
the letters include descriptions of her family 's trip to board the @entity4 and the immediate aftermath of the sinking			1
@entity124 , who was 10 months old when the ship went down , died in october 2007 , the auctioneer said .			0
