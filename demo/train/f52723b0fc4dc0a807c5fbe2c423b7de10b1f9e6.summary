-- @entity1 sits in a director 's chair in one of the many rooms of her " @entity6 " - worthy home , perched high above a prime stretch of @entity9			1
she 's talking about her infamous " @entity11 , " an extended global trek that ran from 2002 to 2005 , and was supposed to be her swan song as a touring artist			1
" i never should have called it that , but it seemed like it at the time , " she tells @entity0			2
" it was like the tour that would not quit			1
i wo n't do that again			2
" a few feet away , members of her entourage burst into laughter			2
exactly one week later , the 67 - year - old entertainer announced her " dressed to kill " tour which kicks off in @entity26 next march			1
according to monday 's press release , @entity1 is scheduled to headline arenas in 49 @entity30 cities -- but who knows ? the lure of her adoring fans may be too hard to resist once she 's packed her g - strings			1
in the meantime , she is out promoting her first album in 12 years , " @entity37			2
" @entity0 's @entity38 sat down with the outspoken @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity42 winner about her own truth , and as usual , the star did n't disappoint with her candor			1
@entity0 : you seem to always speak the truth			2
is that accurate ? @entity1 : i 'm not so sure that 's the truth			1
sometimes i do n't tell the truth , which is telling the truth about not telling the truth			2
i think people do n't tell the truth when they 're afraid that something bad 's going to happen if they tell the truth			1
but i got to be this age , and i 'm doing this , and what 's somebody going to do to me , really ? i say things all the time that i could really get into trouble for , but they kind of blow over			1
@entity0 : you have to admire women who have the courage to put it out there			2
@entity1 : when i grew up , it was a time when women were just supposed to be cute and not have many opinions			1
my mother and her friends were quite different			2
they were all the most beautiful women you 've ever seen ... and they were very strong women			2
when i was with @entity72 -- when i met him , i was 16 , so it did n't bother me until i was 20 - something -- it started to chafe at me			2
i really wanted to do what i wanted to do , say what i wanted to say			2
i did n't want to be shackled to somebody else 's opinion , and @entity72 was very much , " my opinion is your opinion			1
" so when i decided to leave him , i just thought , " i have to get back to myself			2
i have to decide who i am , and just be who i am			2
" i have to tell you something			0
it does n't always turn out			0
it 's not always a happy ending when sometimes you say things that you think , and it goes against the grain of the larger group			1
@entity0 : you recently turned down a chance to perform at the @entity95 in @entity96 , in protest of the @entity100 government 's stance on gay rights			1
@entity1 : well , first of all , it was back channels			1
but it was to be an @entity30 ambassador , to sing or to do something in the opening			0
i have a lot of great friends in @entity100 -- wonderful people , people i really love -- and i have great fans there , too			1
the @entity112 are the @entity112 , so it was n't something that i 'd think , " ah , that 's sad			1
" but you ca n't			0
if i were an athlete , i 'd think long and hard , because you spend your whole life preparing for the whole moment , and then your life is nothing			1
so i could n't fault an athlete			0
but mine was just , " it would have been fun			0
" you just ca n't do it			0
@entity0 : do you think gay rights have taken a backwards turn in some parts of the world ? @entity1 : i think maybe gay marriage has scared some part of the world			1
i 've seen many countries where it 's punishable by death			1
how can people be so afraid of something that 's really not going to involve them ? i just do n't get it			1
my mother had gay friends			0
it 's something i was around my whole life			1
also , my best fan base is gay guys that have never gone ( away )			0
they 've always been there			0
all i can hope is that the people that i know in @entity100 , that there are more people like that			1
i never felt that when i was there			0
we had gay guys with us in my show , and it was like , no problem			0
so i hope this is just a bad period in their history , and it 'll blow over			0
look , when i was young , it was against the law			0
it 's amazing how far we 've come in that amount of time			1
@entity0 : you really pushed boundaries in 1989 with your music video , " @entity175			0
" @entity1 : it seems like nothing now , but the first one to push is the first one to push			1
so yeah , i got a lot of flack for that			0
it does n't make any difference			0
it 's a great video , and it kind of stands the test of time			1
but when you 're pushing against the people , they either have more judgment , or they do n't see the humor in it			0
some people got really unhappy , and that 's why they pulled the video after it had already been on for weeks and weeks			1
then they started playing it late at night			0
i think there are probably some things that kids should n't see			0
i do n't think that was one of them			0
if you look at it in comparison to what 's happening today , it 's nothing			1
@entity0 : what did you think of @entity210 ' performance on the @entity211 ? @entity1 : you have to give her credit for trying something , for trying to stretch the boundaries			1
i did n't like it because i did n't think it was very good			0
if she had come out naked , and done that and pulled it off , i would have said , " you stretched it			0
" but i did n't love it as an art form			0
i thought it was sloppy			0
i did n't think it was professional enough for her			0
i think she 's got to go back to the drawing board			1
and yet everybody 's talking about it			1
i certainly do n't think she deserved all the flak that she got for it			0
it was just one performance at the @entity211			0
who cares ? @entity0 : it 's hard to believe you 're 67			1
@entity1 : i know ! it 's terrible			1
i do n't like any of them			0
i thought i was 10 years younger , and i was upset			0
but you know , my mom has this saying -- and i 'm not sure i agree with her -- but she said , " if you do n't pay attention to age , then it wo n't pay attention to you			0
" and she says it , and it sounds nice , but i do n't buy it			0
@entity0 : are skimpy costumes still part of your stage show ? @entity1 : well , not always , but will be as long as i can do it			1
my friends and i were talking the other day , and we were looking at what we were wearing and it 's the same things that we 've been wearing since we were in our 20s			1
and i remember thinking , " when will i have to stop wearing jeans , or when will i have to cut my hair ? " all those things , but it does n't seem like it			0
i 'm going to die wearing the same things that i love wearing			0
i 'm going to wear my jeans			1
i 'm going to wear wifebeaters			1
i 'm going to wear my leather jacket			1
as long as i can look good in it , and feel comfortable in it , then i 'm going to do it			2
@entity0 : are we going to see a " @entity11 2 ? " @entity1 : yes , absolutely ! i should n't have called it that , but it seemed like it was at the time			1
it was like the tour that would not quit			2
i wo n't do that again			0
the reason i 'm doing this is mainly because i know i really will never do it again because i do n't have the energy			0
it takes so much energy to be on the road i know i have finite energy , and i can probably squeak by this time , but i did the longest tour ever by a woman , and i do n't think there were 20 - year - olds who could handle that			2
three - and - a - half years is a really long time			2
but if i do n't do it now , i wo n't do it			0
i 'm not like when @entity298 ( @entity299 ) came back and did a tour at 70			2
that 's not going to be me			2
she 's got a great life force			2
at some point , you have to give up your career -- unless you 're @entity307 or @entity308			0
i still can do it now , so i should			0
@entity0 : i think you 'll still be out there at 90 , rocking a g - string			0
@entity1 : you think so ? @entity0 : yeah			1
@entity1 : i do n't .			1
