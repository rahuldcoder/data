-- the " games " have officially begun ! last night , " @entity1 " grossed a truly staggering $ 19.7 million from midnight showings across the country -- the highest midnight total ever for a non-sequel , and the seventh highest midnight total ever ( behind three " @entity7 " and three " twilights " )			1
after only a few hours , it 's clear that the film is already a smash , and it 's almost certainly headed for a debut well above the $ 100 million mark			2
sure , the overnight figure ca n't compare to the $ 43.5 million that " @entity15 and the @entity16 -- part 2 " conjured up at midnight shows last year ( on its way to $ 169.3 million -- the highest opening weekend of all time ) , or the $ 30.3 million that " @entity20 : breaking @entity22 -- part 1 " found at midnight on its way to $ 138.1 million , but it 's likely that " @entity1 , " which does n't have the same amount of built - in sequel anticipation , wo n't face the same weekend frontloadedness as those titles			1
saturday and sunday grosses should prove quite sturdy			1
back in 2008 , " @entity34 " earned $ 18.5 million at midnight , but still managed a stunning $ 158 million debut -- the second highest debut of all time -- proving that not every blockbuster makes a full 25 percent of its opening weekend gross at midnight			2
based on this $ 19.7 million figure , " @entity1 " should take in at least $ 50 million on friday and could reach as high as $ 150 million over the full weekend frame -- although that estimation is very bullish			1
my fellow box office prognosticating colleague @entity38 is predicting a more sensible $ 130 million weekend			0
we 'll have to wait and see see how high it climbs			0
either way , it appears that the odds are very much in @entity46 's favor ! see the full article at @entity0			0
