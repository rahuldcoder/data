-- former @entity2 defender @entity1 has told @entity3 he is baffled by @entity2 coach @entity5 's decision to omit @entity6 from the forthcoming @entity8 tournament			1
@entity5 insisted he had decided to exclude the 33 - year - old @entity10 center - back from his 23 - man squad for purely footballing reasons			1
but @entity1 , who won 73 caps and played in three @entity15 campaigns for his @entity2 , thinks @entity5 's call has more to do with off - field concerns			1
former @entity2 captain @entity18 has been included in the squad , despite awaiting trial on charges he racially abused @entity23 's brother @entity22 during an @entity25 match in october			1
did @entity27 win the title -- or did @entity10 lose it ? @entity18 was stripped of the captaincy over the affair , leading to the resignation of @entity32 , and @entity1 is convinced the ongoing court case involving the @entity35 player was a factor in @entity5 's decision			1
" i do n't know what 's gone on , " he told @entity0			2
" i do n't know the conversation @entity5 has had with @entity18 or @entity6			1
that 's going to probably be kept quiet			0
" but i think it did play a small , or a big part in it , because you 're away for four to six weeks together , ( @entity5 is ) probably thinking , maybe something might happen at the camp			0
" but you ca n't say for football reasons @entity6 should n't be going because he 's experienced , he knows how to play football , he 's an excellent defender , he 's been fantastic for his club and country , especially in the last three months			2
" @entity5 said his conversations with both players would remain private though he did reveal @entity6 was gracious and wished @entity2 well for the competition			1
of @entity55 , the former @entity56 manager , said : " i realized that when i selected him there would be people who would raise eyebrows but that 's the decision that i 've made , that 's the decision i shall live with			2
" @entity27 sorry for @entity63 's ' @entity62 ' banner @entity6 took to social networking site @entity65 to express his disappointment at missing out , saying : " absolutely loved playing for @entity2			2
to say i 'm gutted is an understatement of the highest order			0
" @entity1 believes @entity6 's vast experience on the international stage will prove a big miss for @entity5 's side			1
" i ca n't believe it , " he told @entity0			0
" he 's played the last 10 , 12 games for @entity10 , he 's played excellently , he 's fit as a fiddle			0
" you need all your experienced players in a tournament like this			0
if you want younger players who are coming in and learning their way around international football , start with them in a campaign , at the beginning of your qualifying			0
" start not at the end , when you need the most experienced players at the tournament			0
@entity23 knows his way around all these tournaments			0
you need characters like that			0
" @entity1 , who played in six consecutive major tournaments for his country between 1996 and 2006 , did back @entity5 's decision to hand @entity97 the captain 's armband though			1
the @entity56 skipper has 90 caps to his name since making his debut in 2000 and @entity1 said : " i 'm surprised @entity104 did n't become captain sooner			2
" he 's always seemed to be overlooked but he 's an excellent captain for his club , @entity56 , and i 'm sure he 'd be excellent for @entity2			1
