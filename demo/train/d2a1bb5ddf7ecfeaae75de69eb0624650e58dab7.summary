the meteor that exploded over the steppes of southwestern @entity2 sent a low - frequency rumble bouncing through the @entity4 , giving scientists new clues about the biggest cosmic intruder in a century			1
the big boom over @entity9 on february 15 also produced a wave of sound thousands of times lower than a piano 's middle c -- far below the range of human hearing , according to the international agency that watches for nuclear bomb tests			1
the @entity19 said that sound wave showed up on sensors from @entity22 to @entity23 , making it the largest ever detected by its network			1
scientists then used that wave to calculate the size of the small asteroid that plunged to @entity4 , said @entity29 , an astronomer at @entity31 's @entity30			1
the duration of the wave -- about 32 seconds -- let scientists estimate the energy of the blast at between 450 and 500 kilotons , the size of about 30 early nuclear bombs from there , @entity29 said , they could calculate the size of the fireball ; and using an estimate of the meteor 's speed from the numerous dashboard and mobile - phone cameras that captured the scene , it was " first - year physics " to figure out the approximate size and weight , she said			1
the latest estimate is that the @entity9 meteor was about 56 feet ( 17 meters ) across , weighed more than 7,000 tons and was moving about 18 kilometers per second ( 40,000 mph ) when it blew apart , she said			2
opinion : a meteor and asteroid : 1 in 100 million odds " in terms of things we have observed , this is the largest since @entity67 , " @entity29 said , referring to the suspected meteor that flattened a @entity62 forest in 1908			0
the nuclear test monitors pick up " infrasound " , or low frequency , waves from about 20 meteors a year -- " if conditions are right , perhaps as small as a pea , " she said			1
@entity2 authorities say more than 1,500 people were hurt , mostly by flying glass , when the @entity9 meteor exploded in spectacular fashion			2
amateur video footage showed a bright white streak moving rapidly across the sky before exploding with an even brighter flash and a deafening bang			0
@entity84 , head of @entity86 's @entity85 , said scientists believe the object originated in the asteroid belt between @entity90 and @entity91			2
it was the @entity93 of asteroids , which circle the sun in oblong orbits , that occasionally cross @entity4 's			0
@entity84 said scientists expect to study the @entity9 event for months			0
but the dozens of fragments that have been found so far point to a fairly common , stony asteroid with traces of nickel and iron			0
" the composition is not at all unusual as far as meteorites go , " he said			0
" it was just very big			0

nuclear test sensors picked up meteor 's sound wave as far away as @entity23
scientists used that sound to calculate the size of the space rock
