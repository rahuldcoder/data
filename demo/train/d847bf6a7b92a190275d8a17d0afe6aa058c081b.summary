high blood pressure is truly a silent killer			1
in fact , a heart attack or stroke may be the first sign that you even have a problem			0
that 's why it 's so important to get your blood pressure checked every time you go to the doctor -- especially if you 're a woman			1
high blood pressure can lead to stroke , kidney problems , heart trouble and other conditions			1
about 35 million @entity19 women have high blood pressure , and a third of them do n't know it			1
in part , experts say , the increase comes just because women are living longer and doctors are paying more attention to the problem			2
but less - benign factors -- such as the exploding use of anti-inflammatory medicines ( which make your body retain salt ) and ever - increasing waistlines -- may be at play in what the @entity36 calls a rise in uncontrolled hypertension in women			1
fortunately , there are many ways to control your blood pressure , even without medication			1
and just knowing your numbers is half the battle , says @entity47 , @entity48 , president of the @entity36			0
but that does n't mean fighting high blood pressure is a cinch			1
here are the stories of three women whose high blood pressure took them by surprise			1
think about them the next time that cuff goes around your arm			0
@entity60 , 45 while @entity60 exper Â­ ienced hypertension during all three of her pregnancies , her blood pressure always returned to normal after each birth			1
later , as she juggled working and caring for her young children , the thin , nonsmoking telecommunications executive who lives outside of @entity68 , @entity69 , considered herself healthy ( except for her high cholesterol )			2
then one day about seven years ago , she could n't stop coughing during a water aerobics class			2
a month later , she was shocked to find out that she had congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema , or swelling of the lungs			0
high blood pressure was behind the problems			1
following open - heart surgery to repair a 99 percent blockage in her left main coronary artery , @entity60 was terminated from her job because of her illness and went on disability			2
she has n't worked in seven years because of chronic chest pain and other conditions			2
learn some tricks to lower your blood pressure looking back , she remembers that in her 20s , her blood pressure was elevated when she was first found to have high cholesterol			1
" they said it was white - coat hypertension [ the idea that just being in a medical office can drive blood pressure up ] , " @entity60 says			1
" no one said , ' hey , you need to exercise , ' or anything			0
" so she did n't			2
now she 's on two blood pressure medications -- an @entity104 inhibitor that lowers levels of blood vessel - tightening chemicals and a beta - blocker that slows heart rate -- and her pressure 's normal			1
daily two - mile walks help , too			2
" get a baseline number , and keep an eye on it , " she says			0
" take care of yourself first so you can be there to take care of your children			0
" @entity120 , 43 on the way to a regular medical checkup last year , @entity120 , an @entity122 , @entity121 - area marketing director , was in good spirits			2
her weight was under control at 145 pounds , and she thought she was healthy			0
her blood pressure had been slightly elevated at past checkups , but she had never been told to do anything about it			1
her reading was 160 over 100 , and she remembers her doctor saying , " you 're like a firecracker -- ready to pop. " @entity120 was petrified : " i thought i was going to die			0
" her doctor put her on blood pressure medication immediately			1
read which 10 foods are best for your heart now she takes a beta - blocker and a calcium channel blocker , which also relaxes blood vessels			2
to stay healthy , she and her husband walk every other evening after dinner			0
the hardest part ? giving up the fried foods she loves			0
" every now and then , i 'll cheat and have some fried chicken over at my sister 's house , " she confesses			0
but she 's learned to broil , bake , and stir - fry tomatoes , collards , cabbage , and other vegetables			0
@entity120 is among the 43 percent of @entity157 - @entity19 women who have hypertension			1
the risk for @entity157 is much higher than for @entity160 or whites , although it 's not clear why			2
@entity120 thinks there is only one way to cope : " i felt fine , but that ' s not good enough			0
it 's especially important for @entity157 - @entity19 women to go to a doctor routinely			1
that 's the only way you 're going to know you have it			0
" @entity169 , 50 even though her mother had hypertension , @entity172 , a hospital human resources specialist in @entity174 , @entity175 , did n't think about her family medical history 20 years ago when she started having headaches and blurred vision -- two of the very rare symptoms of high blood pressure			1
then one of the hospital 's nurse managers took @entity172 's blood pressure and sent her straight to a cardiologist			1
read who is at risk of high blood pressure her blood pressure is now under control thanks to an @entity104 inhibitor , a diuretic , and some overdue diet changes			1
she 's trying to lose weight -- hoping to drop 30 pounds -- and the self - professed saltaholic has cut way back on her favorite foods			2
" potato chips , fries , all those good things , " @entity172 says			0
" i could literally put salt in my hand and eat it			0
" too much salt makes many people retain water , which increases blood volume and puts more pressure on arteries			1
the diuretic also helps break that cycle			0
why was n't @entity172 more active in controlling her risks at a younger age ? probably because she grew up on a farm , and her parents rarely saw a doctor			0
her mother died at age 80 in 2002 after a stroke and heart attack			0
" now i make sure to have my blood pressure checked once a week , " @entity172 says			1
" this is n't a condition that i can just take care of when i have the time			0
" try a free trial issue of @entity226 ! @entity227 2009			0

about 35 million @entity19 women have high blood pressure ; a third do n't know it
forty - three percent of @entity157 - @entity19 women have hypertension
weight loss , *excercise* and cutting salt in diet can help lower blood pressure
