-- in contrast to the 2002 farewell summit between president @entity3 and outgoing @entity5 president @entity4 at @entity3 's ranch in @entity7 , @entity8 , this week 's talks between @entity10 and @entity11 in @entity12 mark the first time in history that a @entity16 president will host a series of informal meetings with a new @entity5 leader			1
while issues such as @entity21 , cybersecurity and the economy will likely dominate their discussions , what really matters is whether @entity11 and @entity10 can establish a trusting personal relationship that will help both leaders overcome stark policy differences			2
as charismatic leaders who view themselves as transformational figures , what better way to start the conversation than to outline their aspirations and plans for resolving pressing domestic matters ? both @entity11 and @entity10 are finding themselves at political crossroads that will define their subsequent days in office			1
both need to solve a confluence of structural problems while confronting cynical constituencies that can easily turn on them			0
for @entity10 , dealing with a seemingly intractable partisan divide in @entity46 is hard enough			0
a series of recent bureaucratic problems has made his burden worse , resulting in what some have referred to as his " second term blues			0
" for @entity11 , an apparent turn to conservatism has the potential to bring his erstwhile reform - minded political honeymoon to an untimely end			2
luckily , each leader has the opportunity this week to talk with one of the few counterparts in the world who can empathize with the magnitude of the issues			0
in his first few months as president , @entity11 has worked to give the @entity5 government a face - lift , trying to contain corruption and construct a sense of nationalism by offering his people something they aspire to : the @entity72 , or what @entity11 has described as the rejuvenation of the @entity5 nation and the opportunity to realize a middle - class lifestyle			2
as @entity11 pursues these aspirations , he should join @entity10 in exploring similar issues that are hindering both countries -- a growing divide between the rich and poor , persistent post-graduate unemployment , housing bubbles , food safety concerns , immigration ( or internal migration for @entity5 ) reform , health care reform and tax reform			1
if @entity11 is to be successful in confronting these issues , it will be difficult to do so without political reform			1
in @entity5 , dissent has been growing on college campuses , where academics have received recommendations instructing them not to speak about seven sensitive issues : universal values , freedom of the press , civil society , civil rights , past party mistakes , crony capitalism and judicial independence			0
whether such official guidelines persist will determine if there is hope for an open and intellectually dynamic political environment that can accommodate socioeconomic changes			0
as a former professor of constitutional law , @entity10 is uniquely situated to address the importance of @entity5 political reform and constitutionalism			1
@entity10 needs to stress that avoiding intellectual discussion of political issues does n't make them go awayâ € ” it only pushes such discussion into less structured arenas , and @entity5 has seen how that has turned out in the past			2
as the first black president , @entity10 can also candidly and respectfully articulate @entity16 's lessons from the civil rights movement and its firm commitment to democracy , human rights , media freedom and the rule of law , which the @entity16 believe to be fundamental to the long - term stability and prosperity of any country			0
some might argue that discussion of @entity5 's much needed political reform would set @entity10 and @entity11 on course for a contentious relationship			1
in fact , it would help remind @entity11 that he can seize this moment to stand on the right side of history and turn back from the conservative path before he squanders the reform - minded political capital he has built over his first productive months in office			1
instead of focusing solely on specific issues like national security and economic rebalancing , @entity10 and @entity11 have an opportunity to set the stage for a deeper , more candid and more cooperative @entity5 - @entity16 relationship by crafting a shared vision of the future and drawing on the common needs and desires of the @entity5 and @entity16 people			1
only by talking about their domestic challenges and areas for improvement will they realize the potential fruits to be born out of such cooperation			0
and only when such unity of purpose is realized will @entity5 and @entity16 be able to work together and tackle the economic and security issues of our time			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 and @entity173 .			2

president @entity10 and president @entity11 are meeting for informal talks
@entity172 , @entity173 : the two leaders should discuss their domestic issues
@entity10 is uniquely *qualified* to focus on the importance of @entity5 political reform , they say
@entity172 , @entity173 : @entity10 can remind @entity11 to seize the moment and stand on the right side of history
