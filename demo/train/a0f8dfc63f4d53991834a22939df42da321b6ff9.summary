@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 has 323,000 active duty service members , many of them housed in close quarters -- yet it is able to avoid major outbreaks of contagious diseases like those seen on commercial cruise ships			1
nearly 700 crew and passengers onboard @entity15 's @entity14 were sickened by norovirus in january before the ship returned to its port in @entity19 , @entity20			1
in addition , the @entity21 , operated by @entity22 , cut a seven - day itinerary short the same week because of a norovirus outbreak that affected 178 passengers and 11 crew members			1
in the @entity3 , such an outbreak would cripple a ship			1
" if we had a norovirus that took out 700 sailors , we obviously would be operationally ineffective , combat ineffective -- but even a smaller number , a smaller outbreak of , say , 100 would devastate our operational capability , " capt. @entity30 , commanding officer on the @entity31 , said aboard his ship docked in @entity0 , @entity1			1
" serious outbreaks of 10 or 20 individuals being sick are taken very seriously			1
" some 3,200 sailors and marines fill the amphibious assault ship when it deploys , and each of them are medically screened and inoculated before being allowed to embark			2
" the idea is to prevent somebody from getting ill. once you do become ill from one of these highly contagious organisms , you are really chasing it then , " vice adm. @entity45 , surgeon general of the @entity3 , told @entity2			1
" one person touches something , then three people touch that and they become infected , then three people from them , and pretty soon you 've gone from 1 to 3 to 9 to 27 and that is how a cruise ship , in short order , has 700 people come down			0
" what is norovirus ? onboard a warship like the @entity31 , sailors are required to report to sickbay if they feel unwell			2
" they come to us for sick call , and if they are particularly stoic and do n't want to come to us for whatever reason , their supervisor will make them come , " said @entity64 , the vessel 's senior medical officer			2
if a sailor does become ill with a contagious disease , he or she will be isolated so the infection does not spread			0
" you monitor the movements of everybody who is ill. you make sure they are staying away from the general population on the ship			0
they are not to go to their work station , they are not to go to the food places , " @entity45 said			0
keeping vessels extraordinarily clean is part of the daily routine for everyone onboard @entity3 ships			1
" every day at 0730 we basically do a cleaning station of the ship			2
every department has their own space , " sailor @entity95 said , clearly showing pride in his section of the passageway			0
if we want to go out on deployment for eight or nine months , we need to make sure it 's clean			0
" in the kitchens , cleaning is constant to prevent foodborne illnesses			2
" it 's important to keep it clean because cross-contamination is a big factor for illnesses , " said @entity106 , @entity31 culinary specialist			0
just in case crews in the galleys miss something , preventive medicine technicians like @entity113 inspect multiple times every day			0
they are " making sure their hands are clean , uniforms are clean , they have hairnets on properly , making sure their lines are clean , so there is not dirt buildup or anything like that which could get people sick , " he said			0
is your cruise safe ? the rigorous discipline and devotion to cleaning is aided by simply not having certain creature comforts , such as those cruise ship passengers expect			1
" if you have a ship whose main center of gravity is social gatherings , food places , dancing areas places for libations , and gating on decks and swimming pools -- all of those things that sailors wish they had , but do n't have on our @entity3 ships -- then i think it is a much more challenging environment to control the spread of a highly contagious virus , " @entity45 said			1
@entity30 experienced an outbreak firsthand , years before taking command of the @entity31			0
half of the 30 people onboard his small ship fell ill. " somebody did n't have clean hands , ( did n't ) wash their hands properly and stuck their hand in an ice dispenser and anybody who got ice from that dispenser got sick , " he said			2
that 's why he , and sailors across the @entity3 , swab , inspect , scrub and scour every day			1
