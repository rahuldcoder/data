know anything about his arrest and @entity11 joy ride allegedly under the influence of marijuana , alcohol and prescription drugs			2
sadly , parents of tweens and teens , especially those who continue to adore the 19 - year - old superstar ( despite his ongoing public travails ) , are not quite so lucky			2
but instead of fretting over what to say , many parents believe his arrest is a chance to continue the conversation about drinking , drug use and doing either while behind the wheel			1
" i have used these sorts of ' public displays of difficulty , ' as i like to call them , to sometimes segue into a conversation about what they would do if they had a friend who was in the same situation , " said @entity29 , a mom of two in @entity31 and co-author of the book " @entity34			1
" " however , i do n't use these as teachable moments all of the time , " @entity45 , a clinical social worker , said in response to a request for comment on @entity49			0
" teens only listen for so long and too many ' examples ' feels like proselytizing to them			0
" parents should try to do more listening than talking , and ask kids what they think about @entity6 's troubles , said @entity60 , a @entity61 mom of two and author of numerous books for kids and teens including her latest " @entity66			1
" " scaffold their growing ability to think through complex issues like celebrity , entitlement , fame , substance abuse -- and really listen to their thoughts , " said @entity60 , also on @entity49			0
" so often we think we have to have the correct answers and serve them up like so many inoculations to our kids			2
being present and asking questions is sometimes the wiser , more respectful , and ultimately more empowering route			0
" asking kids what really defines " greatness " could be enormously beneficial to them , said @entity85 , a mother , grandmother and former elementary school principal			1
" in conversations with my young students , i tried to steer the dialogue with them to a point where they were telling me the qualities they thought made someone worthy of being idolized , " said @entity88 , who continues to work with schools through her education consulting firm			0
" kids can come to an accepted belief that it 's not the talent that makes you great			1
it is what you do with it and your contribution to the whole that defines you , " said @entity88			2
" it is okay for kids to love ( @entity6 's ) voice but differentiate that from him being a model of behavior			1
" parents can sometimes " go overboard " when it comes to worrying about who their teens idolize , said @entity45 , the clinical social worker			2
" who amongst us did not swoon for someone when we were teens ? but in reality did any of us copy their lives and confuse it with reality ? " she added			0
@entity129 : @entity6 's inner circle @entity131 , a mom of two and radio host of @entity133 in @entity134 , says her 11 - year - old would say she chose not to be a @entity6 fan " on purpose			1
" " we make a point of steering our kids away from ' idol worship , ' reminding them that they are just as valuable as any celebrity , " @entity138 said			2
" the fact that @entity146 ( is he old enough for mr. ? ) @entity6 was arrested helps us drive home that point			1
celebrities are just as fallible as anyone else , and there 's no need to worship them			2
" @entity154 , a behavioral therapist and author of the book " inside the mind of an @entity158 , " believes @entity6 is suffering from what therapists call " imposter syndrome			1
" " it 's basically someone who really lives in fear of being revealed for who he or she believes they really are , " said @entity154 , who said he suffered from this himself and shared his own experiences in his book			0
" i guarantee when they go home and look in the mirror after a huge concert and a huge night that they do n't see the person that everyone else is seeing , " @entity154 said of @entity6 and other celebrities who might struggle with insecurities			1
" in fact , they are scared to death that people are going to see the person that they are seeing so ... the person will continue to implode and fall apart			0
" @entity154 's advice to parents is to encourage kids to learn from the pop star instead of criticizing him			1
" the lesson is happiness is an inside job and that true validation has to come from looking in the mirror and liking who you see regardless of ... chaos going on around you , " @entity154 said			0
@entity6 " got lost somehow and had to give up himself and he was so overwhelmed with validation from outside himself that he was lost and you do n't want that to happen to you , " said @entity154 , describing a conversation parents could have with their kids			1
as for @entity6 's teenage fans , @entity138 , the @entity134 radio personality , believes they should n't stop liking him			1
" and i 'll go one step further and say they should n't judge him , " she said			0
" every person needs love , so i 'm not going to tell a child to stop loving a person ( celebrity or not ) just because they 've made some bad decisions			0
" ' " it is important to remind our kids that our mistakes do not define us , " said @entity220 , author of the new book " @entity222 : how parents can fight the @entity228 and @entity229 , from @entity230			1
" " @entity6 's mistakes are a big deal , but they are not life altering , " @entity220 said			1
" thankfully , no one was killed while @entity6 was driving drunk and drag racing			2
luckily , no one overdosed that night			0
" that said , his troubles are also a cautionary tale of what fame can bring , she added			0
" an important thing to point out to our kids is just how many of these young stars have crashed and burned out like this			0
maybe , " she said , " being famous is n't all it is cracked up to be			0
" follow @entity249 on @entity250 and like @entity251 on @entity49 .			0
