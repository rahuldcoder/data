@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 did n't get to be a billionaire by delegating			2
@entity3 says he was " completely surprised " by " @entity5			1
" holding fast to his vision -- and his marketing rights -- for the " @entity5 " empire has made it the biggest franchise in history , and made @entity3 one of the most powerful people in entertainment			1
but while he 's enthusiastic about the new touring show " @entity5 , " it was n't his idea , and when i talked with him before the first @entity0 performance this week , he kept giving the credit to others			1
" @entity5 " is built around @entity23 ' well - known scores from the films , performed by a symphony orchestra and choir , and accompanied by specially edited clips from all six movies , displayed on a mammoth led screen			1
@entity30 , who has played and voiced the golden protocol droid " @entity34 " in every film and most of the spinoffs , provides live narration -- and another reason for the " @entity5 " fans in the audience , especially those waving lightsabers and dressed as everything from sand people to @entity43 stormtroopers , to cheer mightily , as they did the night i interviewed @entity3			1
@entity44 praises the ' force ' of the show @entity3 : i 've seen some presentations of , you know , live orchestras with " @entity5 " clips , and that sort of thing			1
but this is so much more than that -- it 's so much more emotional , because what they 've done is taken the emotional content of the score ... one is obviously the @entity61 , one is obviously romantic ... and then they 've cut all the pictures around that from all the movies , so that you get this really wide range of visuals going with the music , and it really is quite powerful when you see the depictions of all of the various @entity43 shenanigans that were going on over the @entity61			2
@entity2 : obviously , when @entity23 did the music for the original film , neither of you could have guessed your association would last so long , or that you 'd be so identified with each other			0
how did he get involved originally ? @entity3 : what i did was , i was doing this space opera , and i was talking to @entity87 and i said , " look , i 've got to get somebody who really knows the old - fashioned music score , i really am doing some giant romantic action adventure , you know , throwback to the ' 30s , and who do you know that can do that ? " and he said , " oh , there 's only one person who can do that and that 's @entity23 -- he did ' @entity94 ' and he 's perfect			1
" and i said ok , and i met him , and we hit it off , you know , perfectly , and doing the first film was such a great experience -- he 's so wonderful to work with -- that , you know , i 'll never let him go			0
and @entity87 wo n't let him go either ! @entity2 : how did this show come together ? @entity3 : @entity102 ! [ @entity3 calls over @entity103 , the president of @entity104			0
] you 're the man who did the whole thing -- i 've got nothing to do with it			0
... we would kid him about how his concert was going and he had to get @entity114 [ @entity23 ] to buy in and me to buy in			0
@entity103 : well , he always got it from the beginning , so he was an easy sell			0
@entity2 : but what was it he " got " ? how did you sell him on a new concept for his franchise ? @entity103 : i think he understood that the music was so powerful and the images are so powerful that when you put that together with a live orchestra on a big venue , i mean , who would not be thrilled to see that ? @entity2 : it 's a very different experience , being live			2
@entity3 : it 's very powerful			2
i was completely surprised by it			0
and i 've seen other live orchestra performances with " @entity5 " images , but nothing like this -- i mean this really works , because it was edited specifically to bring out the emotion .			0

" @entity5 ' features @entity23 ' music and scenes from films
@entity3 supported idea , though he 's quick to give credit to others
effect of the *arrangement* ? " it 's very powerful , " says @entity3
" @entity5 " *remains* a *tremendously* *successful* franchise
