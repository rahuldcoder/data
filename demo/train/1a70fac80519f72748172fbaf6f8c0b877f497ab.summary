-- the tragic killing of @entity2 and the initial decision by the police not to arrest @entity5 for that killing have focused public attention on @entity8 's " stand your ground " law			1
according to police , @entity5 claims self - defense , but many observers ca n't understand how a grown man with a gun can plausibly claim that he was forced to kill a teenager armed only with some candy			2
if that 's the law of self - defense in @entity8 ( and elsewhere ) , these observers argue , the law needs to change			1
the law of self - defense is at its core about reasonableness			2
if a person reasonably perceives a serious threat of harm , and uses reasonable force to meet that threat , the law justifies even deadly force , and it does so even if it turns out that the perceived threat was illusory			2
people have differing views of what 's reasonable and , as a consequence , self - defense laws ( which vary by jurisdiction ) have always attempted to further define the concept			1
until very recently , @entity8 's definition of reasonableness , as in many states , incorporated a longstanding principle , the " duty to retreat			1
" this principle required that someone who found themselves in a violent confrontation had to try to defuse the situation and retreat " to the wall " before resorting to deadly force			2
in other words , deadly force was only permitted as a last resort			2
the basic idea was simple : if more people backed down , retreated or stepped aside , fewer people would be killed			0
the " duty to retreat " also made it easier for prosecutors to prove that a killing was not in self - defense			1
the facts that can be proven are often murky ( particularly when of the two people who know what happened , one is the defendant and the other is dead ) and prosecutors could often , by pointing to a defendant 's failure to retreat , obtain a conviction even without establishing the precise facts			0
in @entity75 jurisdictions there has long been an exception to the duty to retreat called the " @entity78			0
" as then - judge ( and later @entity75 @entity80 ) @entity81 explained in 1914 : " it is not now and never has been the law that a man assailed in his own dwelling is bound to retreat			0
if assailed there , he may stand his ground and resist the attack			0
he is under no duty to take to the fields and the highways , a fugitive from his own home			0
" in recent times , " stand your ground " laws extended this concept in many states beyond the home to any place where a person might lawfully be found , such as a bar or a public sidewalk			0
@entity8 's version enacted in 2005 ( over the objection of many in law enforcement ) is one of the most far reaching			1
the law states that a person " who is attacked " anywhere he is lawfully present has " no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force , including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm			1
" importantly , a person can not invoke this provision if he is " engaged in unlawful activity " or " initially provokes the use of force against himself			0
" finally , in @entity8 , once self - defense becomes an issue at trial , the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self - defense -- a heavy burden			1
this is the legal backdrop against which @entity8 's prosecuting authorities must assess all claims of self - defense , including @entity5 's			1
in an ideal world , law enforcement would make this assessment by thoroughly investigating the case and , after determining the provable facts , comparing those facts to the law			2
critical to this determination will be evidence reflecting : how the confrontation began and how the suspect acted after the confrontation ( prosecutors often look for actions such as flight or a cover - up that indicate a " consciousness of guilt " )			0
perhaps most critically , investigators will compare all the evidence ( physical and otherwise ) with the suspect 's statement ( if any ) about what happened			0
if the investigation reveals sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that @entity5 was not acting in self - defense ( as @entity8 law defines that concept ) , he can be prosecuted			1
if not , charges are unwarranted			0
depending on the facts that ultimately emerge , the " stand your ground " law may ultimately control the legal outcome of the @entity2 case			1
if , as a result , @entity8 's citizens and legislators ( and those in other states ) see that law in a new light , they can change the law , perhaps leading to fewer tragic outcomes in the future			2
for it may ( as many suspect ) be the case that @entity5 was not forced to kill @entity2			0
but in a state like @entity8 with a " stand your ground " law , that is no longer the standard for determining whether someone acted lawfully in self - defense			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity202 .			0

@entity202 : until recently , @entity8 's self - defense law included a " duty to retreat "
in 2005 , @entity8 *overrode* law enforcement objections , adopted a " stand your ground " rule
@entity202 says that even on a sidewalk , people may defend themselves with deadly force
he says " @entity217 " may ultimately decide outcome of @entity2 shooting
