-- " @entity1 " has called it a season , and the concluding chapter had its fair share of the romance , births , deaths and scheming that make the show " must - see television " every week			1
that is , for everyone but @entity12 , it seems			1
but for those of us who have been watching since the very beginning , this season was seven episodes of welcoming new characters and mourning the loss of a few fan favorites			1
oh , and did we mention @entity21 ? ! production will soon begin on @entity23 , but until then , here are our top five takeaways from sunday 's finale			1
the end of @entity28 the end everyone saw coming			2
it was reported months ago that main cast member @entity31 would be shutting the door on his time at @entity1			2
it was n't long after that news of a death in the @entity37 ender began circulating			1
for many , it was just a matter of putting two and two together			2
but for those who remained unspoiled , the car accident at the end of this episode may have come as quite the shocker			2
the end had come for heartthrob @entity28			2
after this , and the earlier death of @entity49 , it appears no life is brought into the world of @entity1 without the loss of another			1
yes , @entity54 gave birth to her first son -- a child who will never get to know his father			1
the family dynamic at our favorite @entity60 country home certainly has changed since the start of the @entity64 ' 20s			2
we now have a widow , widower , two young children and a teen occupying space at @entity1			2
how will the family come to terms with the loss of @entity28 ? how will @entity73 deal with the death of her only son ? will @entity54 find love again ? one can only hope the next season explores this hardship instead of jumping a year or two ahead			1
romance is in the air almost everyone at @entity1 faced love life developments before last night 's credits rolled			1
@entity85 appears more interested in following her heart than her mind as she warms up to the advances of her married editor , @entity89			2
but is @entity85 willing to risk bringing scandal to @entity1 as " the other woman " ? we 'll have to wait for the next season to know for sure			1
@entity93 and @entity94 appear more in love than ever as they share picnics and let their hair down on their @entity100 trip with the family			1
in the presence of the warring @entity106 , @entity103 and @entity104 drew closer and shared a couple of tender moments			0
even mrs. @entity109 and @entity73 each found an admirer in this sprawling episode -- or so they thought			0
it 's not long before both those flames are put out , but it was a pleasant surprise seeing focus spent on the loves of our favorite supporting players			0
@entity119 is still dealing with his upgraded social status @entity119 did not join the @entity28 clan on the @entity100 trip , and decided to spend his time with the staff to keep from feeling alone			1
there was one employee in particular who caught @entity128 's attention : new maid @entity126			1
@entity126 develops an attraction to the widower and proceeds to act on her feelings with a kiss			0
it does n't take long for @entity134 and @entity135 to catch onto the pair , and they fire the chambermaid before things can go any further			0
@entity119 is still reeling from @entity49 's death and is still struggling with his transition from employee to family member			1
he wants to relate to both sides , but has to accept that he is leading a new life			0
will @entity119 find a new mother for @entity147 ? perhaps , but neither he nor fans may be prepared for that just yet			1
the staff finally get out of the house for a spot of fun it was nice to see the staff get some time off from their employers			1
it 's not often we see this bunch out of uniform enjoying a little fun outdoors			0
the trip to the fair provided a chance for the gang to let loose			0
we also got a nice resolution to the @entity169 conflict that plagued episode six			0
after @entity169 is jumped by a trio of men , it 's @entity169 who comes to his rescue ! there may be a heart of gold hidden underneath those layers of lies and schemes that initially made @entity169 so villainous			0
it 's not long before @entity184 thanks @entity169 and the two agree to be friends			0
strictly platonic , that is			0
@entity187 is here to stay ! that 's right , much to many fans ' dismay , we have n't seen the last of @entity187			0
in fact , the rebellious teen will be moving in with the @entity28 family as her parents travel to @entity196			0
we suspect it 's only a matter of time before the @entity199 grows tired of @entity187 's antics and has her killed off , but perhaps that 's mixing confusion with desire			0
either way , the latest lady to enter @entity1 is sure to stir up trouble , and we all know the @entity1 ca n't run without a little scandal mixed in .			0
