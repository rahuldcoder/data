-- @entity3 could turn out like @entity4 if the current rate of international investment does n't increase , the country 's deputy finance minister told @entity0 monday			1
" i 'm not suggesting a failed state , " @entity7 said			1
" what i 'm suggesting ( is ) a state where citizens do n't get the right services delivered to them			2
" @entity3 sparked an international security alert this weekend when two packages mailed from the poor @entity16 nation were found to have explosives inside			1
the bombs could have brought down the planes carrying them , officials said			2
@entity3 has become a major new battleground for @entity22 , but @entity7 denied it could become a " failed state " with no effective central government , like @entity4			1
" i do n't think @entity3 is a collapsing state			1
i do n't think @entity3 is a weak state , " he told @entity0 's @entity25 in an interview for " @entity27			1
" but it needs $ 45 - to $ 50 billion in investment over the next decade to give people jobs , water , and electricity because " extremism flourishes in an area where people have no jobs and too much time on their hands			1
and we need the support of the international community to make sure that jobs are being created and services delivered to these people and that will certainly help stabilize the country and reduce extremism			1
" @entity7 said it " would not surprise " him if the @entity51 increased its covert activities in his country in the wake of the foiled bomb plot , but that " as a @entity3 citizen " he did not like the idea of unmanned @entity51 drones			1
the @entity51 is thought to use drones to fire missiles at suspected terrorists in @entity61 , among other locations			2
it does not officially confirm such strikes			2
a @entity51 official said monday the @entity51 @entity66 continues to expand its intelligence operations in @entity3 with more operatives and analysts working closely with the @entity3 government and other @entity51 partners inside the country			1
the increased focus on @entity3 predates the @entity75 attempt to blow up an airliner over @entity77			1
there has been no decision on expanding the @entity66 role to include running a drone campaign in @entity3			2
the official said the @entity66 has the capability to do so , but it ultimately is a @entity85 decision to move forward on that front			0
regarding the threat of @entity89 compared to @entity90 , the official said " this is not a zero sum game			0
" @entity22 @entity61 remains very dangerous even though it is under intense pressure by the @entity51 because of drone missile attacks			0
the official pointed to the @entity98 plot as having its roots in @entity61			0
@entity89 is an affiliate that has become increasingly more active			0
the two groups communicate and share ideas			0
@entity22 in @entity61 encourages @entity89 to carry out attacks			0
however , the official said @entity89 makes its own tactical decisions , runs its own day to day operations			0
the official said @entity3 - @entity51 cleric @entity108 is clearly playing a more prominent operational role in @entity89 , he is part of the senior leadership			1
it would not be surprising if in the end , @entity108 had a role in the cargo bombing plot , but so far there is no direct evidence of that , the official said			0
another @entity51 official also said it " would n't be a surprise if he ends up implicated in this			0
" both officials said it is still unclear the intent of the cargo plot , this is whether the bombs were to explode in the planes or at the synagogues or had another purpose			0
the second official said the fact these were " real devices , a real attempt " pretty much discounts any theory that this was merely a trial run by the terrorists -- " it does n't hold much water anymore			0
" this official said experts are examining the devices to determine how they would have worked and whether they had the capability to work as intended			0
@entity0 's @entity145 contributed to this report			2
