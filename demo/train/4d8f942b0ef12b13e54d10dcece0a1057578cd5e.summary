-- the varying response to @entity3 's uprising across the @entity4 largely reflects different views on the role of the @entity7 ; while @entity8 has condemned the coup , an assortment of voices from @entity12 to the @entity13 to the @entity15 government have all been cheering this sudden blow to the @entity18 who seemed to be in the ascendance across the region just a few months ago			1
regional governments who feared the rise of the @entity7 are broadly pleased to see the army return as the key power - broker , as they believe it will restore order , stability and predictability			1
but the army did not act alone			0
it was enabled to move by mass popular protests that temporarily brought extremely disparate groups together -- united only by their opposition to @entity37			0
the lesson the protesters will be drawing is that protests still work			0
while @entity3 's future is too uncertain to make it a model that others immediately want to emulate , this fresh demonstration of the power of the street will again inspire protest movements elsewhere in the @entity51 world , whether demonstrating against long - established authoritarian regimes , or newer elected @entity54 counterparts			1
just as the protesters may in time grow more skeptical about the role of the army , the authoritarian governments that are welcoming the change in @entity3 may also come to regret applauding a fresh uprising			1

even after elections , the likely scenario is a coalition government representing a fragmented polity , probably preoccupied with internal issues more than taking dramatic foreign - policy stances			0
but the overthrow of the @entity51 world 's first elected president from a @entity7 party has international reverberations , since the @entity7 exists in some form in virtually every @entity51 country and beyond			1
for years , local branches of the @entity7 have been judged to be the most well - organized opposition movements in many of the authoritarian countries of the @entity51 world , where heavy restrictions on civil society and party organizations have often pushed political opposition underground and into the mosques			1
after the @entity51 uprisings , parties associated with the international @entity7 were the most successful groups in elections in @entity3 and @entity92 , though less so in @entity93			1
they 've been major players in the uprisings in @entity95 and in @entity15			0
and before all this , it was @entity98 -- an offshoot of the @entity7 -- that won the @entity101 parliamentary elections in 2006 , the last time elections were permitted in the @entity101 territories			2
read more : get ready for extremist backlash the only country where the @entity7 has been able to consolidate power over a number of years has been @entity8 , whose ruling party , the @entity108 , is associated with the organization			2
@entity8 has also faced hefty protests in recent weeks as opponents of the government accuse prime minister @entity114 of arrogance , crude majoritarianism , and trying to impose a monolithic @entity54 identity on a diverse society -- but while these criticisms echo those made of @entity37 , @entity114 has been able to consolidate his power to a far greater degree , not least because he has overseen a decade of successful economic development , whereas @entity3 's economy has suffered from 2011 as political uncertainty has deterred investors and tourists			1
all this means the stakes in @entity3 are very high			2
@entity37 and his supporters , whose thinking has been shaped by their years in opposition under a dictatorship , were well aware that they faced regional opposition , but hoped that if they were careful not to alienate the @entity135 , they would be allowed to remain in office			0
thus , they focused on consolidating their domestic power , but did not seriously challenge the regional order ; @entity37 brokered a ceasefire when conflict erupted between @entity12 and militias in the @entity144 last year , and the @entity7 emphasised its openness to and interest in @entity148 investment			2
but they often erred by trying to discredit all of @entity3 's diverse and vocal political opposition as if it was merely a foreign - sponsored counter-revolutionary force			1
just at the time when they most needed to reach out , as the scale of the opposition became evident in this week 's street protests , they spoke disparagingly about the opposition , saying , for instance , that protesters were being sponsored by @entity161 , @entity162 's last prime minister , who @entity37 narrowly defeated in the presidential run - off a year ago , and who is now living in the @entity13			2
indeed , many in the @entity13 will be glad to see the @entity7 " brand " damaged , even if they have their doubts about the methods of mass street protests			2
the @entity171 ' foreign minister , @entity170 , was among the first officials to congratulate @entity3 after the military announced a new president would take charge			2
this came just two days after the @entity171 sentenced 68 dissidents , including a cousin of the ruler of the emirate of @entity181 , to jail sentences for plotting to overthrow the government , accusing them of belonging to an underground group associated with the @entity7			2
earlier this month the @entity171 also arrested several @entity3 accused of forming an underground @entity7 cell there			1
the news poses much more of a dilemma for @entity188 , which , unlike all the other @entity13 monarchies , was quick to lend its support to @entity51 protest movements , at least as long as they stayed outside the @entity13			0
the tiny , gas - rich emirate has built strong ties with the @entity7 ruling parties in @entity3 and @entity92			1
now , its 33 year - old new emir , who has been in power only two weeks since the abdication of his father , may need to chart a different course and make some hurried outreach to a wider range of political movements -- which might include more conservative @entity54 groups , like @entity3 's @entity206 parties , as well as leftist and liberal groups			1
the new emir has congratulated @entity3 's new president , though not as quickly as the @entity171 or @entity210 did			1
@entity12 's cabinet has been ordered not to speak publicly about @entity37 's overthrow , presumably for fear that if @entity12 officials comment , they 'll immediately be blamed , in a region prone to conspiracy theories			0
in fact their feelings are likely to be mixed : @entity12 sees the @entity7 's ideology as a profound security threat , but they had continued to cooperate with the @entity3 authorities on border security , and will now be concerned that the fresh political uncertainty could distract the army from securing the large and often lawless @entity229 region along @entity12 's border , home to a number of jihadi movements			1
the @entity234 has also sent mixed messages : it did not want to call for the overthrow of an elected president just one year into office , though it had been warning him to listen to his people			0
but @entity241 has stopped short of calling @entity37 's overthrow a military coup , even though the intervention of the army to change the president and suspend the constitution fits virtually every known definition of a coup			0
the semantics are political : the @entity234			0
wants to retain leverage with the @entity3 military , and if it labels their actions a coup , it would ordinarily be obliged to cut off its military aid , normally around $ 1.2b per year			0
the beleaguered @entity15 president , @entity256 , has also been cheered by the sight of a military coup against the @entity7 , since the @entity259 forms a significant part of the opposition to his own military regime			0
@entity256 has declared this the end of political islam , blithely ignoring the fact his own main external allies are @entity268 and @entity269			0
the @entity7 's critics see @entity37 's overthrow -- along with the political transition in @entity188 and even the protests in @entity8 -- as the end of an era for these @entity18			1
for their part , the @entity7 will see this as a temporary reversal , just as @entity8 too faced successive military coups			0
the question is whether @entity3 , and other countries in the region , will be able to accommodate a movement that is no longer a majority but is still the best organized political force in many countries , or whether it will again be driven underground			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity289 .			0

@entity289 says differing views on @entity3 's uprising reflect views on the @entity7
regional governments who feared the group 's rise are broadly pleased , she says
however , @entity289 says governments applauding the uprising may come to regret it
demonstrations in @entity3 will again inspire protests elsewhere in the @entity51 world , she says
