the @entity1 was just a restaurant in @entity3 to me for years after i moved here			1
i thought the data programmers -- who left calculus back where i left fractions -- were out of their analyst minds when , the morning after a game , they 'd huddle in the office hallways to relive a lay - up or exclaim about a buzzer - beater basket			2
then i met coach @entity14			1
i was in my second semester teaching feature writing in the @entity16 at the @entity17			2
among the assignments i gave my students was an interview piece			1
as i 'd done the first semester , i brought in a person of prominence for the students to interview			1
in this case , coach @entity14			1
he arrived on time , was directed to my classroom , and , as i heard later , word of his being there spread through the halls			2
when word reached the library that @entity14 was in the building , i was later told , the librarian -- who one has to think did n't follow basketball -- asked : " what 's he dean of ? the students knew			1
and learned from the coach that , " i have a job i enjoy			2
if you enjoy going to work , then you 're one of the lucky people in the world ... " that he 'd " like to study great @entity47 and @entity48 theologians			2
with that background anyone could go out and help society in any job			2
i think we 're all ministers , whether good or bad ... " one student 's piece captured that side of the man , who was the first coach to give a full athletic scholarship to a black man , integrating men 's college basketball			1
in the article , the student wrote : " like his credentials , which only manage to scar the surface of the man 's personality , there 's something more			2
" perhaps it has to do with that one word which kept clicking through @entity14 's conversation like a scratched record : society			1
' i 'm still listening to society a little ... ' ' society is saying win -- lose ... ' ' ... most state alumni , who reflect society ... ' '			2
. if only we could teach society ... ' " that spring of 1981 , he still had not won " the big one , " still had the " monkey on his back			2
" he took care of that the following year , when @entity84 won the @entity85 , with a little help from @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			0
then won again in 1993			0
when he retired in october 1997 , @entity14 had 879 victories , an @entity92 record			1
the man who in his first year , as a young coach , with a losing record , returned from an away game to find he 'd been hanged in effigy			0
it came up in class that day , and i remember that however matter of fact , yes - that 's - what - happened his reply , it did n't quite hide the hurt			0
during his visit , i also remember him telling the story of the time at practice one of his players -- who liked to shoot the ball , not pass it -- had to take the ball out of bounds after a basket			0
when he did , coach @entity14 pulled the other players off the court			1
the player stood there on the sideline , looking to his left for someone to throw it to , then to his right , then straight ahead , as his fellow players watched on the opposite sideline , smiling			0
speaking of practice , coach @entity14 reportedly never allowed anyone to watch practice			1
it mattered not if you 'd given a million dollars for a building -- or might give a hundred million			0
but , then , when i was at @entity140 with @entity142 @entity141 for a business lunch with an associate , coach @entity14 came in , passed our table and moved on to his table			1
as he did so , @entity148 told us how coach @entity14 had sent word to the parents of a little girl who had been murdered on her way to school two days before , and the media was still camped out on her street			1
so her brother would not have to come home to that , coach @entity14 invited him to watch practice			1
there are uncounted examples of his kindness and thoughtfulness			0
@entity163 , " @entity164 of the @entity165 " for more than 25 years , also came to class to be interviewed			0
i 'd frequently ask him to talk about the time @entity87 did his dipsy - doodle , whirly - gig , now - you - see - it - now - you - do n't dunk at the end of a game against @entity173			0
it was so hard to believe that the video of the play was run over , and over , even the following night on the late sportscast			0
but , @entity163 said that as he was preparing his weekly radio program with coach @entity14 , he received a call from the coach 's long - time secretary , @entity180			1
i forget if she relayed coach @entity14 's wish or he came on the line , but there 's no question about what he wanted : he wanted @entity163 to make no mention of the play , lest it embarrass the @entity173 coach and players			1
i met coach @entity14 a number of times in the years following his visit to my class			1
we " did not do lunch , " as i like to say , but he was always friendly and would nod			0
the last time i saw him was at a local restaurant eight years ago			0
that year , in meeting the student assignment for a color feature on a basketball afternoon or evening in @entity3 , my student @entity200 wrote about the @entity204 , better known as the @entity204 -- a term , i understand , he hated			0
she titled her feature " @entity208 " because the @entity204 was where " thousands make the semi-weekly pilgrimage to worship at the altar of greatness			0
" a bit later , " we risk a long fall to look up and be humbled by the testaments to glory - day heroes hanging in the rafters			0
only the great ones live there in the rafters , as if hung in the stars like gods			0
" on saturday , legends filed into @entity208 to be praised by tens of thousands of revelers living the glory vicariously through these men			0
before the crowds stood the 1957 and 1982 @entity230 winning basketball teams and @entity14 , @entity232 himself			1
" a couple of weeks later , as i was seated at a local restaurant , i glanced around and there , two tables to my left , with a friend , was @entity14			1
i almost had to put my hand over my mouth to keep from blurting out : " and zeus himself			0
" up there with the gods .			0

@entity249 : @entity14 was a winner whose social *conscience* helped *reshape* college sports
students regarded him rightly as an *olympian* , she says
