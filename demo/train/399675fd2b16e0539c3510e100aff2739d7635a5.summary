-- in his september 4 op - ed , @entity1 presents his case that young @entity4 should cast their ballots for president @entity6 this fall			1
published on the same day it was widely reported that the national debt had hit $ 16 trillion , his piece is as ill - timed as it is unconvincing			1
seeking to speak to and for his generation , he characterizes @entity6 as " our biggest ally in @entity13			1
" he neglects , of course , to recount the harsh realities of the @entity6 economy			1
instead , his message rests on the flimsy notion that we should hang on a little bit longer because enduring change takes time			0
you may be wondering what happened to " we ca n't wait " and " yes we can			1
" @entity1 concedes that we 're " a little more cynical , " but contends that " just because our politics and government can disappoint us sometimes does n't mean we should forget how far we 've come			2
" how far we 've come ? unfortunately , such an argument demonstrates a sloppiness with the facts			0
take , for instance , the fact that unemployment has remained above 8 % since the beginning of @entity6 's term			1
or , according to this analysis , that half of recent college graduates are jobless or underemployed or that under @entity6 , the national debt has risen $ 5 trillion			1
or that @entity6 presided over the first credit downgrade in @entity4 history			1
the point is , these facts are overwhelming			0
and they are neither fair to young @entity4 nor signs of the progress for which we yearn			2
rather , they are the residue of generational theft , of promises unmet , of false hopes and of crushed dreams			0
in a word , travesty			0
to argue otherwise is to fall out of a fairy tale			0
@entity1 begins his piece with " @entity58 's " @entity57			0
he compares @entity57 's desire to escape phonies to young people 's support for @entity6 in his first presidential campaign			1
but the problem with that analysis is that it 's four years out of date			0
in 2008 , @entity6 regaled us with promises of hope and change , but his time in office has exposed the emptiness of these promises			1
and there 's more than meets to the eye to the president 's self - proclaimed achievements			1
while his allies may credit his health care law with allowing members of my generation to stay on our parents ' health care until we 're in our mid- 20s , the real question is , why ca n't we find jobs in the first place ? @entity6 regards students as beneficiaries of his achievements			1
@entity1 praises the president 's " insistence on keeping student interest rates low , " but that has n't kept student loan debt from reaching record levels			1
@entity1 's discussion of @entity6 's energy policy is equally selective			1
he talks about the president 's " investments in clean energy projects and jobs , " but fails to mention that some of these " investments " came at a high price and on the dime of taxpayers			2
the saying goes that brevity is the soul of wit , so this argument merits a one - word refutation : @entity116			2
but of all of @entity1 's claims , perhaps the most misguided is the notion that @entity6 has displayed political courage in the @entity120			2
he has refused to reform entitlements in a way that will ensure they remain solvent for future generations -- which is to say , us			0
instead , he started a brand new trillion - dollar entitlement program in the @entity128 , or @entity128 , an unaffordable government takeover of our nation 's health care system			0
his fiscal stewardship has been nothing short of a disaster			0
four consecutive years of trillion - dollar deficits is n't courageous ; it 's immoral			2
@entity1 does get one thing correct , however : part of growing up is coming to terms with heartbreaking truths			0
but in this case , it 's about coming to terms with the fact that @entity6 has had his chance to lead and his policies have failed			2
we do n't have to fall into line once again only to be taken for granted			0
we can vote for a new direction			0
we can reward truth - telling			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity155 .			2

an op - ed recently urged young people not to give up on president @entity6
@entity155 says *writer* overlooks the failure of @entity6 to fix the economy
@entity155 : grads ca n't find work , are *burdened* with student loan debt
we need @entity152 to move country in a new direction , @entity155 writes
