-- @entity1 returned to the top of the table in @entity4 after edging past @entity5 1 - 0 on saturday , while previous leaders @entity6 could only draw 1 - 1 at @entity8			1
@entity1 , still missing the injured @entity9 and with veteran talisman @entity10 starting on the bench , dominated struggling @entity5 but had only a solitary first - half strike from @entity13 to show for it			1
the visitors should have snatched a point , but @entity16 saw his 77th minute effort wrongly ruled out for an offside by a teammate who was not in the line of play			1
real , whose last home outing ended in an embarrassing exit from the @entity25 against lower - league opposition , saw midfielder @entity27 hit the post in the 13th minute and then defender @entity29 also hit the woodwork with a floated cross			0
@entity32 forward @entity13 , who started in place of @entity10 , kept up his good goalscoring form in the 22nd minute when he pounced from close range after @entity38 's right - wing cross was not cleared			2
@entity39 thought he had doubled the lead in the 55th minute , but the @entity43 forward 's effort was correctly ruled out for a marginal offside before he made way for @entity10			2
the result lifted some of the pressure piling up on @entity1 coach @entity49 , who has a big week ahead with wednesday 's @entity51 clash against @entity52 and then the " @entity54 " battle with @entity6 on sunday			1
@entity1 will go into that match at the @entity56 with a one - point lead over @entity6 , who were missing the swine flu - stricken @entity59 , @entity61 and @entity62 and the injured @entity63 for the trip to @entity8			1
@entity65 inspired the @entity4 and @entity68 champions ' best moments in the first half , with @entity70 left on the bench following his controversial handball incident in @entity43 's @entity74 playoff win against the @entity75 on wednesday			2
but it was the @entity77 side who should have taken the lead on the stroke of halftime when @entity82 headed a golden chance wide when it seemed easier to score			0
@entity6 took the lead in the 54th minute when @entity86 threaded a superb pass to @entity88 and the @entity90 fullback coolly slotted in the opening goal			0
however , that lead lasted only nine minutes as substitute @entity93 ghosted in behind @entity88 to collect his teammate 's headed flick - on and calmly sidefoot high into the net			0
@entity70 was finally brought on by coach @entity97 in the 84th minute , but @entity6 could not penetrate the stubborn @entity8 defense , with the home side left in seventh place after a hard - earned point			1
@entity6 next take on @entity103 champions @entity102 in the @entity51 on tuesday , needing a result to keep alive their hopes of reaching the knockout stages			0
@entity107 consolidated third place after holding on to win 2 - 1 at @entity109			1
@entity110 put the visitors ahead in the 32nd minute with a close - range finish from a cross by new @entity4 cap @entity114 , who almost gave away a penalty three minutes into the second half when @entity118 went down			2
@entity107 immediately counter-attacked and midfielder @entity119 crashed in a shot from the edge of the area after being set up by fellow @entity90 @entity123			0
striker @entity124 gave @entity109 hope with a superb volley 15 minutes from the end , but @entity107 defended well to earn the three points			0
@entity129 crashed to a third straight defeat under new coach @entity131 , losing 2 - 1 at @entity132 after @entity134 's dramatic last - minute penalty			1
@entity32 striker @entity135 put @entity129 ahead after just three minutes , but @entity136 leveled the score on 20 and @entity134 kept his cool at the death after @entity140 brought down @entity141			0
@entity131 raced onto the pitch as @entity129 protested furiously , resulting in @entity143 being sent off .			0

@entity1 return to top of table in @entity4 after *beating* @entity5 1 - 0
visitors *unlucky* not to earn a point as @entity16 has effort wrongly ruled out
previous leaders @entity6 are one point *adrift* of @entity1 after 1 - 1 draw at @entity8
@entity157 's top two teams will clash in " @entity54 " at the @entity56 next sunday
