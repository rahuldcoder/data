joaquin " @entity1 " @entity0 had an assault rifle handy when authorities raided his beachside hideaway over the weekend , but the world 's most wanted drug lord never opened fire			1
that 's because marines used infrared and body - heat scanners to pinpoint the locations of everyone inside the condo and make sure they were asleep , a @entity9 official told @entity16			1
saturday 's pre-dawn operation that captured @entity0 in the @entity19 resort town of @entity20 marked a dramatic twist in a case that has long captivated the country and frustrated investigators on both sides of the @entity27 - @entity9 border			1
the notorious @entity30 leader 's nickname , which means " @entity1 , " belies the tall and near - mythic status @entity0 achieved in recent years for his ability to elude capture by using bribes , safe houses and an army of cartel helpers			1
his 13 years on the lam ended saturday inside a no - frills condo tower , where investigators found @entity0 lying shirtless next to his beauty - queen wife			2
the @entity9 official , who asked not to be identified because he 's not authorized to speak publicly about the case , said that @entity0 's body guard and the drug lord 's 2 - year - old twin daughters were also sleeping in the condo			1
" he had an @entity46 next to the bed			2
when the @entity9 marines entered the condominium , he was still asleep , " said @entity48 , a former @entity49 official who says he was briefed on the raid			2
" they used the element of surprise , and he did not have a chance to react and seize his weapon			0
" escape through sewer tunnels @entity0 had an assault rifle and ammunition close by when @entity9 marines broke into the apartment in a " surgical " operation , the @entity9 official said			1
authorities had been closing in on @entity0 for months before @entity9 marines swooped in , @entity9 attorney general @entity66 told reporters			2
earlier police operations yielded a trove of intelligence , including cell phone and other data , a @entity27 law enforcement official said			0
that helped @entity9 authorities and @entity49 agents hunting @entity0 gain confidence in recent weeks that they could arrest him			1
before @entity0 's capture , @entity9 federal forces made several significant arrests of @entity30 associates , including two people authorities said were suspected of providing security for top leaders of the cartel			1
a key discovery earlier this month marked a turning point in the investigation : seven houses in the @entity9 city of @entity93 , connected by secret tunnels that also tied in with the city 's sewage system			0
@entity97 , a courier who flipped during questioning by @entity9 authorities , told interrogators about the series of safe houses , according to @entity27 officials familiar with the hunt for @entity0			2
when authorities raided one of them last week , it turned out to be @entity0 's main residence in the town of @entity93			1
the time it took @entity9 marines to get past the house 's reinforced steel doors was enough to allow @entity0 to escape via a hidden hatch under a bathtub , the officials said			2
" but the investigation was so thorough that we continued , " @entity117 said			0
with authorities temporarily off his trail , @entity0 slipped out of @entity93 through the sewer tunnels , the @entity9 official told @entity16			1
eventually he made his way to @entity20 , a beach resort city about 125 miles ( 200 km ) away			0
informants and wiretaps months before authorities nabbed him there , @entity27 authorities made a major break in the case			2
in november , they arrested @entity132 at the @entity134 , @entity135 , border crossing			0
he is the son of @entity137 's closest lieutenant , @entity139 , likely the @entity141 chief 's heir apparent			0
the arrests intensified in recent months , with each providing phones that led to a trove of new data that helped map associates in ever - closer touch with @entity0 , @entity27 officials familiar with the hunt said			2
agents from the @entity49 , @entity151 , and the @entity152 have fed intelligence gleaned from wiretaps and informants to @entity9 authorities for years			2
each cell phone led to dozens of others over time			0
" it went from phone to phone , just basic law enforcement , " one of the @entity27 officials said			0
in recent months , investigators focused on five wiretaps -- four operated by the @entity49 and one by @entity151 , which yielded valuable intelligence , the officials said			2
â€‹ as the hunt intensified , @entity0 and his lieutenants stopped using certain phones , apparently aware of the surveillance			0
in the final days , the @entity151 wiretap was the only one still producing activity , the officials said			0
captured alongside @entity0 was @entity176 , who @entity27 authorities say appeared to serve as " @entity1 's " communications conduit			1
he carried multiple phones that proved crucial to finding the drug boss , the officials said			0
@entity182 marked by rumors , close calls ever since his escape in a laundry cart from @entity9 's @entity189 prison in 2001 , the hunt for @entity0 has grabbed headlines			1
during the drug lord 's nearly 13 years on the lam , rumors swirled about his whereabouts			0
from time to time , investigators suggested they were hot on his trail			0
but even as @entity9 stepped up its pressure on cartels , he remained an elusive target			0
many in the country suggested that his whereabouts were an open secret -- and that the government must have been deliberately steering clear of capturing him			0
in 2009 , the archbishop of @entity9 's @entity205 state told reporters that @entity0 lived near the mountain town of @entity208			2
" everyone knows it , except the authorities , " he said			0
days later , investigators found the bodies of two slain army lieutenants in @entity205 's mountains , accompanied by a note : " neither the government nor priests can handle @entity1			1
" a year later , when asked by reporters again about @entity0 's whereabouts , the archbishop said , " he is omnipresent			1
" in 2012 , a @entity9 official told the @entity223 that authorities nearly caught @entity0 in a raid on a beach mansion in @entity227 , @entity9 , barely a day after @entity228 had met with other foreign ministers from across the hemisphere in the same resort town			1
last year , @entity233 authorities said a man who resembled @entity0 died in @entity235 , @entity233 , during a shootout			2
later , they changed their story and said @entity0 was n't killed and the shootout may never even have happened			0
family still in spotlight while @entity0 managed to avoid authorities ' attention , the wrath of his rivals and the media 's glare , other members of his family were n't so lucky			1
authorities arrested @entity0 's brother , known as " @entity252 " ( @entity253 ) , in @entity254 in september 2001			1
three years later , he was shot to death by a fellow inmate in a maximum - security prison			0
legend has it that " @entity1 " @entity0 was also once arrested in @entity9 's capital , according to an account in @entity263 's book " the last @entity264 : inside the @entity182 for @entity1 , the @entity265			1
" " at the police station , he lifted up a suitcase and put it on the desk of the capital 's chief of police , " @entity263 writes			0
" @entity272 was $ 50,000 in cash ; within minutes , @entity1 was out the door			0
" members of a rival cartel gunned down @entity0 , one of @entity1 's sons , in a @entity9 shopping mall parking lot in 2008			1
police found more than 500 bullet casings at the scene			0
last year , authorities arrested @entity0 's father - in - law in @entity285 , @entity9 , charging him with drug - related crimes			1
but not all of the focus on @entity0 's family has been tied to organized crime			1
in september 2011 , word eked out that @entity0 's beauty - queen wife , @entity292 -- a citizen of both the @entity27 and @entity9 -- had given birth to twin girls at a hospital in @entity296 , @entity297			1
about a year later , authorities arrested @entity299 , one of @entity1 's daughters , at a border crossing in @entity302 , @entity297			1
she was deported back to @entity9 several months later			0
her attorneys said she was pregnant and had been coming to the @entity27 to have a baby .			0
