-- the @entity2 government has criticized former prime minister @entity4 's acknowledgment of a " territorial dispute " with @entity6 over islands in the @entity8 , with the defense minister going so far as to use the word " traitor			1
" on his four - day private visit to @entity6 , @entity4 told reporters in @entity14 on wednesday , " the @entity2 government says there are no territorial disputes ( between the two countries )			1
but if you look at history , there is a dispute			0
" the remarks contradict his own government 's position of indisputable territorial sovereignty over the islands that it calls @entity29 and that @entity6 calls @entity29			1
" if his ( @entity4 's ) remarks have been politically used by @entity6 , i 'm unhappy , " @entity2 defense minister @entity30 said on television thursday			1
" at that moment , the word of ' traitor ' arose in my mind			0
" dangerous waters : behind the islands dispute the day after his controversial remarks , @entity4 , 66 , and his wife visited the @entity40 , which is for the estimated 300,000 people killed in a 1937 massacre by @entity2 forces			1
he is the third former @entity2 prime minister to visit the memorial , following predecessors @entity46 and @entity48			0
the tribute for @entity6 victims stands in contrast to visits by @entity2 officials , including prime minister @entity54 and predecessor @entity55 , to the controversial @entity56 in @entity57 , which is dedicated to @entity2 's war dead , including war criminals			1
" in the eyes of the @entity6 public , ( @entity4 's ) visit is very valuable and undermines those in @entity6 who argue that all @entity2 suffer from amnesia about wartime misdeeds , " said @entity60 , director of asian studies at @entity61			1
" i think this mission is an effort by him to introduce a different tenor into bilateral relations , to show it 's not all about saber - rattling , " he added			0
@entity6 media extensively covered @entity4 's " apology for @entity2 's wartime crimes , " with pictures of the @entity79 bowing and paying silent tribute at the site			1
on social media , the visit triggered wide discussions			0
according to an online poll by @entity87 ( @entity88 ) , 80 % of the more than 222,000 people who voted said @entity4 's visit did not have much political significance , as compared with @entity92 chancellor @entity91 's kneeling before the @entity93 in 1970			2
in another question , nearly two - thirds of 140,000 people surveyed said the visit by a former leader would n't set an example for a fellow @entity2 politician			0
@entity102 commentator @entity101 , however , praised @entity4 and urged the @entity6 to " remember the unusual kindness due to its scarcity , " saying via @entity105 , the microblogging site , " we have reprimanded @entity2 too many times for not acknowledging the massacre			1
" the official account from @entity110 , @entity6 's state - run news agency , warned that the nationalism of people who " scold any @entity2 they see ... is in fact leading the country to distress			2
" an editorial by the government - run @entity118 said that " @entity6 should n't change its policy to @entity2 just because @entity4 , a politician currently out of office , gave a few words of friendship			2
" grievances over @entity126 atrocities added fuel to violent @entity129 protests in @entity6 in september , particularly on the anniversary of the 1931 @entity2 invasion of @entity6			2
and it is not a coincidence , @entity60 said , that a @entity6 plane entered airspace over the disputed islands -- prompting @entity2 to scramble fighter jets -- on december 13 , the 75th anniversary of the massacre			1
it was the first time that the territorial dispute involved planes			0
" the next day on the front page of the newspapers were the images of the ( @entity40 ) @entity40 ceremony and the planes , " @entity60 said			0
the dispute over the islands stems from 1895 , when , at the end of the @entity151 , @entity2 annexed them			2
@entity6 has said that the islands have been its territory for the last five centuries			0
@entity0 's @entity156 and @entity157 in @entity14 and @entity158 in @entity57 contributed to this report .			0
