the companies that make @entity2 printers want a spot in your home			1
they 're just not sure exactly why you need one of their futuristic devices yet			0
the 3 - d printing industry is taking aim at entry - level customers with cheaper , easier - to - use hardware and online marketplaces filled with predesigned files			1
at the annual @entity17 in @entity18 , the @entity2 printing section was larger and busier than in previous years and had an increased focus on consumer - friendly products			1
the technology is trying hard to become mainstream , but first it needs to figure out what average people will really want to create			0
what is a 3 - d printer for ? entry - level 3 - d printers are popular with makers and crafters , people who want to get their hands dirty and create prototypes , figurines and small toys			1
people are constantly experimenting with the devices , trying out unconventional uses like printing guns , fashion accessories and fine art. these hobbyists are a fairly minor market when compared to the lofty aspirations of the consumer @entity2 printing industry , which imagines a 3 - d printer in every home , like paper printers were before people realized printing on paper was pass√©			1
" there 's no killer app yet , " said @entity53 , co-owner of @entity54 , a 3 - d scanner company			1
the people selling printers , files and scanners are n't discouraged by the lack of an obvious use case			0
they seem confident that it will come in the next few years as more people get their hands on the devices and start experimenting , and as the technology becomes more advanced and takes on a wider range of materials			0
plastic is the most commonly used material , but it is just the beginning			0
@entity74 demonstrated its @entity76 food printer at @entity17 , which creates complex shapes out of edible materials such as sugar and chocolate and will cost less than $ 5,000			2
the company also is working on a product that prints ceramics			0
the @entity85 concept device would take pottery to another level with complex designs that can be glazed and fired			0
even at this early stage , the demand for 3 - d printers is rising			1
shipments of @entity2 printers will grow 75 % in 2014 , according to market research firm @entity94			1
it expects the consumer @entity2 printing market to hit $ 133 million this year , which is still far less than the $ 536 million companies will spend on the product			1
new crop of consumer products at @entity17 , the printer companies were focusing on a more immediate problem : 3 - d printing is too complicated for the average person			1
designing a model and creating a workable file takes skill , and the machines themselves can require technical know - how and adjustments like leveling to get a decent final product			0
the newest hardware is trying to make @entity2 printing simple			2
@entity116 announced a new one - button 3 - d printer called the @entity118			1
files can be sent directly to the compact printer from a mobile phone or tablet over @entity123			0
one push of a button and the @entity118 will start creating the object in @entity128 plastic			0
a big barrier to mass adoption of @entity2 printers is price , and hardware costs are falling every year			1
when it comes out in may , the @entity118 will cost $ 1,375			0
that is around $ 1,500 less than the company 's flagship product , the @entity138			0
there are a number of less expensive 3 - d printer options already on the market , some as cheap as $ 200			1
to make 3 - d printing completely hassle free , there are companies that handle the actual dirty work of printing			1
services like @entity149 create small batches of @entity2 printed objects and let the designer control the process online			2
@entity154 and @entity155 are testing in - store @entity2 printer services			1
a number of companies are trying to make the design process easier , too ; @entity2 scanners can take precise photographs of existing objects from every angle to create a printable @entity2 file			1
@entity54 showed off its consumer - friendly 3 - d scanner at @entity17			1
the $ 579 scanner looks like a portable record player and can scan objects up to 9.8 - inches tall			0
@entity116 also recently released an entry level scanner called the @entity171			0
another twist on scanning comes from @entity74 , which demonstrated a @entity2 photo booth			2
the @entity176 booth scans a person 's face and then prints it on an existing figurine body such as a " @entity181 " crew member			0
@entity116 is betting that many people will pay to use existing @entity2 files instead of having to create their own			2
the company announced its new @entity185 at @entity17 , a sort of @entity187 for @entity2 content			1
prices start at 99 cents , and the first designs are focused on kids and families			0
there are cars , characters , animals and other cute 3 - d models , all original content created by @entity116			2
the future might break the law the @entity185 does n't carry replicas of existing products or commercial characters			0
that 's because without licensing deals , it could step into the murky world of @entity2 intellectual property law			0
while it 's still a couple years off , the threat of litigation will become a major issue in @entity2 printing down the line			2
one of the more practical future uses for a @entity2 printer includes replacing broken parts , say a cracked plastic base to an @entity219 blender			2
the part costs a few dollars online , but in the future it could be easier , faster and cheaper to simply print out a replacement at home			0
but unless you buy the file from @entity219 , are you stealing it ? if companies decide to crack down on user - created files , @entity2 objects could be pirated like movies and music			2
whatever the legal , technical and practical challenges , 3 - d printing has its eyes on the future			1
it 's still a long way from being an in - home " @entity181 " style replicator , but the industry is confident it will have enough uses to warrant a spot in your home office or kitchen .			0

@entity2 printers are aiming at consumers with cheaper , easier - to - use devices
a number of 3 - d printing companies *introduced* personal printer tech at @entity17
the devices are mostly used by hobbyists , but a mainstream use could be around the corner
