-- the distance between the @entity2 in downtown @entity3 , @entity4 , and the @entity6 headquarters in downtown @entity7 , @entity8 , is 6,139 miles			1
this quite long distance , however , is bridged by another figure : the number 19			0
on february 19 , after months of protests in @entity3 's center spiraled out of control , a de facto state of emergency took effect in @entity4 , eventually leading to the ouster of president @entity18			1
in @entity19 , february 19 marked a turning point for @entity6 founder @entity21 , who signed a $ 19 billion deal to sell his company to @entity24			2
for @entity4 , that same $ 19 billion would be the answer to its short - term bond debt and gas bills			1
though a mere coincidence , the fact that one country 's economic lifeline could be equal in cost to the purchase of a mobile messaging app in another exemplifies that the real distance between the @entity2 and @entity7 is not geographic			0
before @entity21 was a billionaire and long before he was a @entity19 technology executive , he was @entity4			1
@entity21 , born in a village outside of @entity3 , emigrated from a politically unstable @entity4 as a teenager			1
at the turn of the 20th century , my very own @entity3 - born great - grandfather made a similar choice			1
disillusioned with authoritarianism , he became an anarchist at a time when anarchism was not a meme for punk rockers and skateboarders , but an actual political movement			0
he eventually made his way to @entity52 , where he started a small business			0
there are others like my grandfather and @entity21 in @entity4			1
i 've seen first - hand the potential and technological savvy of the @entity4 people			1
i was blown away by @entity59 -- a project from four @entity4 student developers who created gloves that translate sign language into speech			2
enable talk took home the first prize at the @entity69 competition in 2012 , and @entity70 named it one of the best inventions of the year			0
' we were trapped ' : eyewitness to the massacre in @entity3 according to the @entity76 and @entity75 , @entity4 is the no. 1 outsourcing destination in the region for information - technology services			2
tech companies in @entity19 , @entity81 and @entity82 are teeming with @entity4 engineers -- @entity4 's hackers - for - hire are some of the best in the world			1
but such burgeoning innovators , held back by dysfunctional governance in their country , have not been able to enjoy the kind of success that @entity6 is realizing today			0
at the very moment @entity21 and @entity93 were finalizing their deal , female entrepreneurs in @entity4 were preparing for an event called @entity97 , meant to take place in the capital last weekend			1
the group 's website now reads : " due to political turmoil this event has been postponed			2
" mired in corruption , kleptocracy and authoritarianism , @entity4 has not nurtured the @entity107 of its future			2
a long history of scientific and technological excellence shows that @entity4 - born talent usually realizes its full potential after leaving @entity4 's political environment behind			1
nearly 100 years ago , @entity3 - born @entity114 immigrated to the @entity115 following the @entity116			1
he founded the @entity117 , where he built the first successful helicopter			0
seventy years later , @entity120 's family , also hailing from @entity3 , sought political asylum in @entity52			0
in 1998 , @entity120 founded a company we all know well -- @entity124			0
in @entity4 , the hope is that the days of fleeing political turmoil are coming to an end and that the possibility of new leadership will be a move toward a more functional democracy , less corruption , and more realized potential			2
but whatever early promise there is in @entity3 can quickly be lost if unrest in @entity137 spreads			0
there will be a new wave of emigration out of the @entity137 region if it becomes the staging ground of a proxy conflict between @entity145 and the @entity146			0
whatever happens , for @entity115 , @entity21 's @entity4 roots should also serve as a reminder that we live in a nation of immigrants , that a continual wave of immigration is what fuels our economy			1
when @entity21 and his mother immigrated to @entity7 in 1992 , they subsisted on food stamps and welfare			2
@entity21 barely graduated from high school and dropped out of college			2
he taught himself computer networking from used book store manuals and created @entity6 in 2009			0
in 20 years , @entity21 went from food stamps to billionaire , epitomizing the @entity115 dream , yet he is exactly the type of immigrant that opponents of immigration reform say they do not want in @entity115			1
as our nation continues to tackle the important issue of immigration reform , we need to remember that successful companies are not always founded by the immigrants with a master 's degree in hand			0
symbolically , @entity21 signed his $ 19 billion deal last week at the site where he once stood in line to collect food stamps			0
like @entity6 , 40 % of @entity185 companies were founded by immigrants or their children			0
in march 2013 , @entity21 tweeted about his adoptive homeland : " @entity6 : made in @entity115			1
" @entity4 's new leaders would do well to recognize that it can be home to multibillion - dollar breakouts if it creates a functional environment for its innovators			1
@entity115 would do well to remember that it needs to welcome more families like the @entity107 if it is going to remain the global center of innovation			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity200 .			0

@entity200 notes that price paid to @entity4 - born @entity21 equals @entity4 's past due bills
he says there 's long *tradition* of entrepreneurial success for @entity4 emigres to @entity115
new regime in @entity4 could create an environment of *opportunity* , he says
@entity200 : @entity115 should recognize how vital immigrant entrepreneurs are to its future
