-- last week 's attempted terror attack on an airplane heading from @entity3 to @entity4 has given rise to a bunch of familiar questions			1
how did the explosives get past security screening ? what steps could be taken to avert similar attacks ? why was n't there an air marshal on the flight ? and , predictably , government officials have rushed to institute new safety measures to close holes in the system exposed by the incident			1
reviewing what happened is important , but a lot of the discussion is off - base , a reflection of the fundamentally wrong conception most people have of terrorism and how to combat it			1
terrorism is rare , far rarer than many people think			0
it 's rare because very few people want to commit acts of terrorism , and executing a terrorist plot is much harder than television makes it appear			1
the best defenses against terrorism are largely invisible : investigation , intelligence , and emergency response			0
but even these are less effective at keeping us safe than our social and political policies , both at home and abroad			0
however , our elected leaders do n't think this way : they are far more likely to implement security theater against movie - plot threats			1
a " movie - plot threat " is an overly specific attack scenario			1
whether it 's terrorists with crop dusters , terrorists contaminating the milk supply , or terrorists attacking the @entity59 , specific stories affect our emotions more intensely than mere data does			1
stories are what we fear			0
it 's not just hypothetical stories -- terrorists flying planes into buildings , terrorists with explosives strapped to their legs or with bombs in their shoes , and terrorists with guns and bombs waging a co-ordinated attack against a city are even scarier movie - plot threats because they actually happened			1
" security theater " refers to security measures that make people feel more secure without doing anything to actually improve their security			1
an example : the photo id checks that have sprung up in office buildings			0
no one has ever explained why verifying that someone has a photo @entity92 provides any actual security , but it looks like security to have a uniformed guard - for - hire looking at @entity92 cards			1
airport - security examples include the @entity100 troops stationed at @entity102 airports in the months after 9/11 -- their guns had no bullets			1
the @entity102 color - coded system of threat levels , the pervasive harassment of photographers , and the metal detectors that are increasingly common in hotels and office buildings since the @entity113 terrorist attacks , are additional examples			1
to be sure , reasonable arguments can be made that some terrorist targets are more attractive than others : airplanes because a small bomb can result in the death of everyone aboard , monuments because of their national significance , national events because of television coverage , and transportation because of the numbers of people who commute daily			0
but there are literally millions of potential targets in any large country -- there are 5 million commercial buildings alone in the @entity102 -- and hundreds of potential terrorist tactics			0
it 's impossible to defend every place against everything , and it 's impossible to predict which tactic and target terrorists will try next			1
security is both a feeling and a reality			1
the propensity for security theater comes from the interplay between the public and its leaders			1
when people are scared , they need something done that will make them feel safe , even if it does n't truly make them safer			0
politicians naturally want to do something in response to crisis , even if that something does n't make any sense			1
often , this " something " is directly related to the details of a recent event			0
we confiscate liquids , screen shoes , and ban box cutters on airplanes			0
we tell people they ca n't use an airplane restroom in the last 90 minutes of an international flight			0
but it 's not the target and tactics of the last attack that are important , but the next attack			1
these measures are only effective if we happen to guess what the next terrorists are planning			1
if we spend billions defending our rail systems , and the terrorists bomb a shopping mall instead , we 've wasted our money			2
if we concentrate airport security on screening shoes and confiscating liquids , and the terrorists hide explosives in their brassieres and use solids , we 've wasted our money			1
terrorists do n't care what they blow up and it should n't be our goal merely to force the terrorists to make a minor change in their tactics or targets			2
our current response to terrorism is a form of " magical thinking			0
" it relies on the idea that we can somehow make ourselves safer by protecting against what the terrorists happened to do last time			2
unfortunately for politicians , the security measures that work are largely invisible			1
such measures include enhancing the intelligence - gathering abilities of the secret services , hiring cultural experts and @entity213 translators , building bridges with @entity216 communities both nationally and internationally , funding police capabilities -- both investigative arms to prevent terrorist attacks , and emergency communications systems for after attacks occur -- and arresting terrorist plotters without media fanfare			2
they do not include expansive new police or spying laws			0
our police do n't need any new laws to deal with terrorism ; rather , they need apolitical funding			0
the arrest of the " liquid bombers " in @entity233 is an example : they were caught through old - fashioned intelligence and police work			2
their choice of target ( airplanes ) and tactic ( liquid explosives ) did n't matter ; they would have been arrested regardless			0
but even as we do all of this we can not neglect the feeling of security , because it 's how we collectively overcome the psychological damage that terrorism causes			1
it 's not security theater we need , it 's direct appeals to our feelings			1
the best way to help people feel secure is by acting secure around them			0
instead of reacting to terrorism with fear , we -- and our leaders -- need to react with indomitability , the kind of strength shown by president @entity263 and prime minister @entity264 during @entity265 by not overreacting , by not responding to movie - plot threats , and by not becoming defensive , we demonstrate the resilience of our society , in our laws , our culture , our freedoms			1
there is a difference between indomitability and arrogant " bring ' em on " rhetoric			0
there 's a difference between accepting the inherent risk that comes with a free and open society , and hyping the threats			2
we should treat terrorists like common criminals and give them all the benefits of true and open justice -- not merely because it demonstrates our indomitability , but because it makes us all safer			2
once a society starts circumventing its own laws , the risks to its future stability are much greater than terrorism			0
despite fearful rhetoric to the contrary , terrorism is not a transcendent threat			0
a terrorist attack can not possibly destroy a country 's way of life ; it 's only our reaction to that attack that can do that kind of damage			2
the more we undermine our own laws , the more we convert our buildings into fortresses , the more we reduce the freedoms and liberties at the foundation of our societies , the more we 're doing the terrorists ' job for them			2
today , we can project indomitability by rolling back all the fear - based post- 9/11 security measures			1
our leaders have lost credibility ; getting it back requires a decrease in hyperbole			0
ditch the invasive mass surveillance systems and new police state - like powers			2
return airport security to pre- 9/11 levels			1
remove swagger from our foreign policies			0
show the world that our legal system is up to the challenge of terrorism			0
stop telling people to report all suspicious activity ; it does little but make us suspicious of each other , increasing both fear and helplessness			0
counterterrorism is also hard , especially when we 're psychologically prone to muck it up			0
since 9/11 , we 've embarked on strategies of defending specific targets against specific tactics , overreacting to every terrorist video , stoking fear , demonizing ethnic groups , and treating the terrorists as if they were legitimate military opponents who could actually destroy a country or a way of life -- all of this plays into the hands of terrorists			2
we 'd do much better by leveraging the inherent strengths of our modern democracies and the natural advantages we have over the terrorists : our adaptability and survivability , our international network of laws and law enforcement , and the freedoms and liberties that make our society so enviable			2
the way we live is open enough to make terrorists rare ; we are observant enough to prevent most of the terrorist plots that exist , and indomitable enough to survive the even fewer terrorist plots that actually succeed			2
we do n't need to pretend otherwise			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity373			1
an earlier version of this essay appeared in @entity376 .			0

incident on @entity4 - bound plane led to tightening of airport security
@entity373 says politicians react to incidents by imposing " security theater "
trying to predict what terrorists will do next is futile , @entity373 says
he says it 's better to put *resources* into investigations
