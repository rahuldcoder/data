-- it started with a trickle			0
it ended with a dream washed away by an unstoppable tidal wave			0
a sheepish grin and a prayer to the famous @entity9 weather was the idea , instead it was left to cunning and subterfuge			0
the water flowed like a stream onto the @entity17 field ; the grass disappeared beneath a rapidly growing quagmire			2
this was one way @entity23 manager @entity22 welcomed the great and good of @entity24			1
having watched his side suffer a 3 - 1 defeat in the first leg of their 1957 @entity29 semifinal , @entity22 was taking no chances			1
the fearsome five of @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity37 @entity36 had unleashed an unstoppable force against @entity23 in the opening game in @entity40 showing the kind of skills and cutting edge of which not much had been seen on @entity46 shores since the " @entity47 " demolished @entity48 at @entity49 in 1953			2
this time , @entity22 had other ideas			2
soak the pitch , make it a mud bath and watch his " babes " use their northern grit to emerge victorious			1
it was supposed to be foolproof			0
and he may have even succeeded , but for one prying camera			0
real protest " the second leg was almost never played , " author of " forever a @entity61 : growing up with @entity23 , " @entity64 told @entity0			1
" @entity22 had ordered that the playing pitch be soaked by water sprinklers as he thought that @entity24 would not be used to , or like playing on a heavy surface			1
" unfortunately , a newspaper photographer from the @entity69 took a picture which showed there to be large pools of water lying on the surface of the pitch			0
" of course the water had not soaked in , but when the @entity24 people saw the pictures on the morning of the game -- they threatened not to play unless the sprinklers were turned off			1
" so when @entity80 of @entity24 and @entity23 's @entity82 lock horns in the first leg of the @entity29 last - 16 tie on wednesday in @entity24 , they will evoke memories of that fateful april day in 1957			1
real to face @entity23 in @entity29 that 1957 match had it all -- gamesmanship , a bog - like pitch , diving , @entity90 , suspicious officials and a " hatchet man ' " of an emergency loan signing			1
there was even a @entity23 manager remonstrating with the referee over timekeeping			2
perhaps the game was n't so different 56 years ago , after all			0
" the better team won and should have won more easily one thought for the simple reason that it was the only one with an organized forward line , " said the @entity100 newspaper in its match report			0
the @entity106 was even more scathing of @entity23 's performance , pulling no punches in its headline : " @entity110 and @entity111			2
" " streetwise " when the @entity40 arrived at @entity17 on thursday april 25 , 65,000 hopeful and expectant supporters turned out to see whether the " babes " could hit the headlines for the right reasons			2
" as a 12 - year - old schoolboy , the whole event was magical and sometimes very bewildering , " @entity23 supporter @entity117 told @entity0			1
" for starters , our @entity121 game was a very much more physical contact game than our @entity126 cousins played			0
" we could not understand their propensity to fall over so readily -- yes , sad to say , even the great virtuosos of that sparkling @entity24 side that won the @entity29 five times in a row were not above developing an attack of the ' personal wobbles ' when it was convenient			1
" @entity24 , @entity136 or @entity23 : which is the biggest club ? just as it is now , some 56 years later , @entity24 was the richest club in the @entity126 game and scoured the world over for the most talented players			1
@entity23 's team contained just two players -- @entity145 and @entity146 -- who had commanded a fee , with the club hamstrung in terms of finance following the @entity151 , forcing it to nurture talent from the famous @entity154 , which former chairman @entity155 had founded during the club 's financial struggles			2
the " babes " had already proved to be the most talented side of their generation within the domestic game but their lack of experience was cruelly exposed against a " streetwise " @entity24			2
" nobody in @entity48 was aware about just how good @entity24 was at the time , " said @entity166 , who was at @entity17 as a youngster that day			1
" however , despite their fantastic lineup , @entity23 's ' babes ' were a match for them -- apart from experience			2
" that was the difference between the two teams			0
there was a big difference in the average age between the teams -- @entity23 's was 22 and @entity24 's was 29 , " added @entity166			1
blunt the blade the contest , according to the editorial in the @entity100 , would rest on whether @entity23 could " blunt the edge of the sharpest club attack in @entity185			1
" @entity22 's team had overturned a two - goal deficit in the quarterfinal , winning 3 - 0 at home to @entity190 after losing 5 - 3 in the first leg in @entity40			1
in @entity192 and @entity146 , @entity23 had two forwards who had already terrorized defenses across the continent , plundering goals for fun			2
but it was young winger @entity199 who had caused real the most problems in the first leg , causing the @entity40 to take @entity202 on loan in place of @entity205			0
torres , considered to be one of the hardest men in @entity40 football at the time , was given the task of nullifying the threat posed by the 21 - year - old winger			0
the man who saved @entity23 -- twice it did the trick , too			2
with @entity199 nullified , the attacking prowess of the great @entity32 , the technically supreme @entity36 and the effervescent @entity35 , @entity24 were far too strong , even with the mud bath of a pitch			1
the presence of @entity32 , the @entity220 in 1957 and 1959 , was an almighty treat for those packed inside @entity17			1
it led to the @entity100 heaping praise on one of the most talented players of his generations , comparing him to legendary orchestra conductors of the day -- @entity228 and @entity229			0
" that @entity32 's colleagues should play instinctively up to him is no more surprising than that an orchestra should play up to @entity228 or @entity229 , " it read			0
" he preserves the balance and dictates the tempo in the same way			0
his rewards are said to be fabulous			0
" unstoppable tidal wave with @entity32 to the fore , @entity24 roared into a two - goal lead within the opening 33 minutes thanks to goals from @entity36 and @entity35 to extend its advantage to 5 - 1 on aggregate			1
having played three league games in six days in the lead up to the tie , @entity23 soon grew frustrated despite goals from @entity146 and @entity248 leveling the score on the day			0
constant fouling and a number of offenses left referee @entity253 claiming after the match that " there must have been 50 or 60 infringements			0
" " the game itself was not a great spectacle , " @entity166 recalled			0
" @entity24 feigned injury , wasted time whenever they could , kicked the ball away into the crowd when @entity23 were awarded free - kicks			1
" it was really frustrating as back then , you never ever saw those kind of things happen			0
" @entity24 's style certainly left its impact , with @entity272 telling the media the experience was " damn rough , " while @entity23 captain @entity275 claimed the @entity40 " lacked sportsmanship			1
" a raucous @entity17 crowd booed the visiting players mercilessly at the final outcome , leading @entity106 journalist @entity280 to write how he had " never felt so ashamed of an @entity121 soccer crowd in all my life			0
" @entity280 was left mesmerized by @entity24 and @entity32 in particular , writing how " we were left without words to use for that odd man out among the continentals , @entity32 from the @entity288			0
" what had started as a trickle of optimism had been left submerged by the unstoppable tidal wave of @entity24 's attacking prowess			0
breaking the stranglehold while @entity24 would go on to win the nascent competition for the second year in a row , defeating @entity297 of @entity298 in the final , @entity23 finished the season as @entity121 league champions before losing to @entity302 in the @entity304 final in front of nearly 100,000 at @entity49			1
@entity29 final tickets reduced @entity24 went on to win the first five editions of the competition , but @entity23 's fortunes were left ruined among the wreckage of the 1958 @entity310			1
of the 11 players which lined up against @entity24 , six perished in the accident on february 6 when the plane carrying players , staff , journalists and supporters crashed in a blizzard while trying to take off at the third attempt from @entity322 airport			0
@entity275 , @entity323 , @entity272 , @entity199 , @entity146 and @entity324 all lost their lives alongside fellow teammates @entity326 and @entity328			0
in all , 23 of the 44 passengers lost their lives , while several players and manager @entity22 suffered physical and mental trauma			0
it would be 10 years until @entity23 met @entity24 again , with just two players in @entity334 and @entity335 , both @entity322 survivors , remaining from the team which had lost out in the previous meeting			1
on that occasion , inspired by the mercurial talent of @entity340 , @entity23 triumphed , winning 1 - 0 at home before securing a 3 - 3 draw in @entity24			1
@entity22 's team would go on to lift the trophy at @entity49 after defeating @entity347 's @entity346 4 - 1 , just 10 years after the nightmare of @entity322			2
whether @entity23 would have challenged @entity24 's dominance of @entity126 football during the 1950s remains a hypothetical question			1
@entity24 signed one of the greatest players to have ever stepped onto a football field in the shape of @entity357 's @entity356 in 1958 and saw off all comers until a @entity359 - inspired @entity346 broke the stranglehold in 1961			2
@entity346 and ' the curse of @entity359 ' " would the @entity24 team have remained so dominant in @entity185 had @entity322 not happened ? i do n't think that they would , " said @entity166			0
" i think that @entity23 were on course to win the @entity29 in 1958			1
they were such a young vibrant team , who had gained their first season of experience in @entity185 and had learned a lot from it			0
" there was also much more strength in depth at @entity17 than there was in @entity24			1
" people forget that in season 1958 - 59 , just months after the tragedy , @entity23 's patched - up young team finished runners - up in @entity378 to champions @entity379 -- that was some achievement			2

@entity23 take on @entity24 in the @entity29 this week
the two teams first met back in 1957 when @entity24 prevailed 5 - 3 on aggregate
@entity23 boss @entity22 tried to flood the @entity17 pitch to make it a mud bath
@entity24 launched a protest and threatened to pull out of the contest
