that 's the case for an unusual number of black bears in western @entity5 , where an abnormally warm and dry winter has spurred them to halt their hibernation and head out for food			1
" they may be sleeping under a deck or under a house in a crawlspace , and they will emerge when it is a garbage day and raid some garbage cans and then go back to a sleep for a while , " explains @entity11 , a spokesman for the @entity12			2
@entity22 can take credit for these bears ' abbreviated slumber			0
whereas parts of the @entity28 and @entity29 are now buried in snow and shivering in cold , that 's not the case in many communities around @entity34 and elsewhere			0
the @entity36 's forecast for @entity37 , @entity5 , for instance , calls for high temperatures heading to or well past 50 degrees for the next week at least , with nary of snow flurry in sight			0
what 's with this weather ? hot is cold and cold is hot it 's not just @entity5 : nearby @entity47 is also seeing an abnormal number of black bears , with @entity0 affiliate @entity50 showing images taken from @entity52 and @entity34 's @entity53			1
@entity11 said " a disastrous winter " -- adding " we need the snow " -- and relatively mild temperatures have thrown off some black bears that live in more settled areas , where they can readily access human garbage			1
" we documented this and , in the past 15 years , it occurs sporadically , " the spokesman said			0
" a lot of it is dictated by the weather conditions			0
" even in a typical winter , black bears do n't hibernate completely as some might think , usually taking a few weeks for their metabolism and body temperature to wind down			1
they will occasionally wake up , roam a bit , but wo n't eat , drink , urinate or defecate , according to @entity72 , a cooperative website of the federal @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 that covers the @entity5 mountain range , including @entity34 )			0
bears in this range typically " den " between mid-december into march or the beginning of april , @entity72 notes			1
this is less than the seven and a half months for some black bears that live in colder climes , but still well beyond what 's being seen in parts of @entity5			1
in the past , " lighter winters " have been correlated to " bigger bears that live among humans in @entity37 in the @entity34 basin , " notes @entity11			2
but it 's not like every black bear is cutting short hibernation and heading out on the town			1
@entity11 notes , " bears in the backcountry -- truly wild bears -- do n't partake in this			1
" " they eat nuts and berries and things that are not found in nature right now , " he said , in contrast to the relatively ever - present trash rummaged through by other bears			0
" so they would n't wake up to eat , they would n't find anything			0
" it has also been " unusually warm " this winter in much of @entity111			1
but state wildlife official @entity112 said that bears coming out of hibernation early has n't been an issue there yet			1
that 's because the winter started off , around november , normally			2
even though it 's warmed up , the bears climbed up to 1,000 feet to den in snowy and icy spots that 's cold enough to keep them in , he says			2
still , the state department of @entity125 admits that , hibernating or not , the weather has been weird			0
it 's not even forecast to go below freezing -- even at night -- in @entity129 for at least a week			0
and last week , it was even raining 3,000 feet above sea level in one ski resort around the @entity111 capital , @entity112 recalls			2
@entity135 drought forces rancher to thin herd of horses @entity0 's @entity138 contributed to this report .			0

black bears in the @entity143 typically " den " from december through early *spring*
but some emerge from hibernation early in what 's been called a " disastrous winter "
such bears live near places they can root through garbage ; " wild bears " are n't *affected* yet
official : it 's also been unusually warm in @entity111 , but bears there so far have stayed put
