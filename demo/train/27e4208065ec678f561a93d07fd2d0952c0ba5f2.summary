-- it 's been underway for barely over a week , but @entity3 's election campaign is already drawing attention worldwide following a string of embarrassing gaffes from candidates			1
@entity8 -- the opposition leader who hopes to unseat @entity9 as prime minister on september 7 -- has been the worst offender , with a series of missteps that have threatened to derail his center - right @entity14 's momentum			1
opinion polls have @entity8 's coalition marginally ahead of @entity9 's center - left @entity18 by 52 points to 48			2
the most serious blunder came on tuesday when @entity8 praised a female candidate 's " sex appeal " while campaigning in the @entity23 seat of @entity24			1
" they 're young , feisty , i think i can probably say have a bit of sex appeal , and they 're just very connected with the local area , " he told reporters , when asked what qualities local candidate , @entity28 , had in common with a previous mp			1
the remarks were seized upon by feminists and other critics as evidence that @entity8 holds outdated attitudes towards women , an allegation previously made by former prime minster @entity44 , who once told the @entity3 parliament : " if ( @entity8 ) wants to know what misogyny looks like in modern @entity3 , he does n't need a motion in the @entity50 , he needs a mirror			1
" @entity8 's comments triggered a torrent of criticism and ridicule on social media			1
" my first reaction to this statement was utter disbelief , " wrote one @entity57 user			0
" i am still astonished that this language is considered acceptable			0
" " these comments speak volumes of his true character , and this is not the type of personality that makes a good leader of any kind , let alone a national leader , " wrote another			0
@entity9 waded into the debate wednesday , describing @entity8 's comments as " pretty odd , " and saying any employer who made similar remarks could expect to find themselves " in serious strife			2
" " my policy is pretty simple : in modern @entity3 , neither sexism , nor racism , nor homophobia has any place whatsoever , " he told reporters			0
" i believe people look to their national leaders to set that sort of example			0
" @entity8 said later he had been " a bit exuberant " in his comments , and described the remarks as a consequence of him having " a daggy dad moment " -- using an @entity3 term for something slightly embarrassing or uncool			1
but he did nothing to quiet accusations of sexism when he taunted @entity9 with a question of whether he was " man enough " to rule out a pre-election deal with another party			0

images of @entity8 in his " budgie smugglers , " as the style is known colloquially in @entity3 , were circulated online following his latest remarks , with a caption asking : " just how much sex appeal does it take to win an election , @entity118 ? " @entity8 had earlier made headlines for a piquant slip of the tongue , when he told a crowd in @entity123 monday that " no one -- however smart , however well - educated , however experienced -- is the suppository of all wisdom			1
" a mistimed attempt at baby kissing that saw him plant his lips on the hair of the child 's mother was also singled out for ridicule			0
an aspiring candidate for @entity8 's @entity14 also found himself the target of social media jibes tuesday following an embarrassing on - camera freeze when questioned about his party 's immigration policy			1
@entity140 , a candidate in the @entity142 seat of @entity143 , told a television reporter his party had a six - point plan to " stop the boats " of illegal migrants , but was unable to articulate what any of those points might be			0
his embarrassment followed the humiliation of @entity139 , a 27 - year - old candidate for @entity3 's fringe anti-immigration @entity139 , who blundered through a television interview claiming that @entity157 was a country and that @entity159 followed @entity160			1
the performance , which saw her labeled the " @entity3 @entity163 , " led to her withdrawing her candidacy just 48 hours into the race			0
the slew of political gaffes inspired comedian @entity169 , of the popular @entity171 satirical program @entity172 , to urge the @entity171 to emulate @entity3 and condense its campaigning into one month , promising they would not miss out on any of the entertaining blunders of a typical election season			2
" you might think , ' hold on @entity169 , if our elections were just four weeks , we would n't get to have all the fun of watching the human gaffe - alanches on the campaign trail , ' " he said			0
" but here 's the thing -- you 're wrong			0
you name a great campaign moment and @entity3 will get to it this month			2
" in april , @entity171 president @entity187 apologized after describing @entity189 's attorney general @entity188 to an audience of @entity192 donors as " by far the best - looking attorney general in the country , " a remark that was criticized by some as sexist			0
