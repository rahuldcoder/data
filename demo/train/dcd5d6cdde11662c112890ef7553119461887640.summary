consumers today have more power than ever before			0
the large and diverse selection of media available on newsstands means that customers know what they should be getting , and if they are n't satisfied with the service there 's a host of web sites and forums on which they can let everyone know			0
@entity14 's @entity13 suite in response , organizations are seeking ever more innovative ways of understanding their customers ' needs , and are even turning to anthropologists and sociologists to help them			1
" whereas before a lot of services were designed from the inside out , now , because consumers are so much more empowered , they are having to think about designing from the outside in , " says @entity22 , global practice leader for service design and innovation at @entity26			1
" they have to think much more about the customer experience and then figure out how to make sense of that for the business			2
" @entity26 , a global design firm , is already well - known for designing the first mouse , for @entity39 , and the first notebook computer , for @entity41 , but the company is also causing a stir with its innovative approach to design conception , where the wishes and observations of the consumer hold powerful sway			1
while it employs what one would call " conventional " designers , @entity26 also uses what it terms a " human factor " team -- people trained in anthropology , sociology and political sciences -- who shadow consumers , observe their everyday habits and relationship with a product , and even give them cameras to record photo journals , in a bid to understand what is really needed for a product to push through the barrier and provide true satisfaction for its customer base			1
a case in point is @entity14 's @entity75			1
the hotel chain approached @entity26 for ideas about how to launch an extended - stay brand			1
@entity26 followed guests and employees around , monitoring their habits and probing them with questions about every aspect of their experience at @entity14 's hotels			1
their conversations taught them that extended - stay guests were mainly on the road because of work commitments ; they were away from home through necessity rather than choice and therefore wanted an experience from a hotel that was closer to what they were accustomed to at home -- a " home from home			1
" @entity26 recommended that @entity14 install a " map wall " in the lobby , with recommendations from fellow guests , such as where to find the best coffee shop or restaurant and where to go jogging in the local area			1
but they also found that while guests were looking for familiar home comforts , they were also there to work			1
with that in mind , they drew up prototypes for guest rooms that more closely resemble live / work areas , with an office incorporated into the layout of the bedroom			0
market research is not a new concept			0
organizations have been bringing their potential customers together for decades to understand what they want from their services			0
but @entity22 argues that it is by sending its cohorts into the field to observe customers in their natural environments that @entity26 gains the real insights and results			1
she says that while some customers might struggle to articulate their needs -- or even fully comprehend what they are looking for in the first place -- simply by looking at their daily routines @entity26 's researchers can gain significant understanding of what can be done to improve customers ' relationships with a particular product or service			1
such was the case when @entity26 worked with @entity151 to develop a new credit card			1
the card was targeted at young mothers and @entity26 's observation team set about following a selection of moms around as they went about their daily business : taking their children to school , shopping , even balancing their checkbooks			1
they discovered that many people round up their transactions to the nearest whole number for speed and convenience			2
at the same time , many of the moms were struggling with the discipline of saving , even though they wanted to			0
the solution @entity26 came up with was to introduce a credit card , " @entity175 , " which would instantly transfer the amount customers would usually round up into a separate savings account			1
@entity22 argues that this is an excellent example of where in - field research ultimately inspired an idea that could be transposed to a real - world scheme			2
" just by being able to be with them , empathize with them and observe them you get to see the stuff they ca n't tell you , " she explains			0
" we saw all these habits about putting pennies in jars and rounding things up in checkbooks			2
if you had asked somebody , they would say they just wanted to save money			0
" all this could be interpreted as just a glossy way of rehashing a construct that has already existed within marketing and design for years -- the market research questionnaire			0
but @entity22 argues that the human - centered approach is just one cog in their approach to problem - solving ; trained designers , engineers , business heads and the client must also have their input			1
" it 's not enough going out into the world and coming up with a point of view about that world , " she says			0
" you need to make those insights actionable			0
really , the magic dust in the process is in synthesizing all those perspectives into something that can help you generate amazing ideas			0
" ultimately , the effectiveness of an approach can be best measured by its financial returns			0
@entity151 's " @entity233 " credit card scheme generated 2.5 million new , and presumably happy , customers			1
this willingness by designers to open themselves up to public consultation is becoming increasingly popular			2
in @entity240 , @entity239 's @entity238 took opinions into consideration from a panel of local schoolchildren when designing their new children 's theatre , @entity247			0
a panel of nine - to eighteen - year - olds even had a say in the choice of architect and the menu for the cafe			2
innovations derived from the consultation include knee - high glass panels on the doors so that smaller theater - goers can see where they are going and a sound - proofed room so that parents with crying babies can sit and watch the show without disturbing the rest of the audience			0
in @entity266 , car maker @entity265 opened itself up for suggestions from the public during the design of its relaunched @entity270			0
under the project title " 500 @entity272 , " the hitherto inward - looking manufacturer invited ordinary people to submit ideas for designs on its web site			2
@entity26 , and other design firms like it , are changing the way large organizations interact with their customers			2
they are learning about new ways to keep consumers satisfied , and boosting their bank balances in the process			0
but in the end it 's the consumer who is profiting the most from this new approach .			0

designers now put the consumer , not function , at the heart of new products
global firm @entity26 studies customer *behavior* to influence designs
hotel chain @entity14 devised " home - from - home " suites for extended - stay guests
" @entity175 " credit card rounds up transactions , puts the pennies in savings
