-- the @entity1 ca n't have it both ways on gay rights			1
either it must take steps to accept gay and lesbian people as part of its flock -- including them as full members , embracing their unions , decrying catholic schools that fire gay and lesbian teachers and calling for the full protection of @entity19 people around the world			1
or it can go back to emphasizing its condemnation of homosexual acts as " intrinsically disordered , " as it does in the @entity25			0
the current middle ground -- with church leaders saying " homosexuals have gifts and qualities to offer the @entity32 community , " but not fully embracing them as equal humans in the church and under the law -- is unsustainable and dangerous			1
gay rights groups cheered on monday when a draft document from a group of bishops and priests suggested the church could be more welcoming to the gay community			1
" homosexuals have gifts and qualities to offer to the @entity32 community , " they wrote			0
" are we capable of welcoming these people , guaranteeing to them a fraternal space in our communities ? often they wish to encounter a church that offers them a welcoming home			1
" but on tuesday the @entity54 backtracked from its statements , saying it did not want to create " the impression of a positive evaluation " of same - sex relationships			0
a generous reading of this flip - flop would be that a divided church is wrestling with a sensitive social issue , on which its members and clergy disagree			2
my sense is that the church wants to be seen as tolerating gay people -- and therefore not out of touch with the modern world -- without actually embracing them			1
that sends a potentially dangerous and confusing message to young @entity19 people , who look to the church for moral guidance , and who are more likely to fall prey to homelessness and even to commit suicide than their straight peers			1
( one report from the @entity83 at @entity84 found 40 % of all homeless kids identify as @entity19			1
) these kids like that are looking up to @entity88 , who famously said it 's not his place to judge gay and lesbian people			1
to his credit , @entity88 -- the people 's pope , the guy who drives a old car and lives in a modest apartment -- is setting the right tone			1
but the church needs to follow his lead and move quickly toward real inclusion and acceptance of gays , not just tolerance			1
here are three simple ways it could do so : 1			0
make a serious push for @entity19 rights in @entity106 the @entity1 wields significant influence in @entity106 , which is home to 171 million @entity1 , according to a @entity109 report			1
some countries on the continent are known to persecute @entity19 people -- including giving them prison sentences			1
catholic leaders have spoken out against the death penalty and violence being used against @entity19 people			1
but they should go further			0
in their statement , church leaders said on monday that it is not " acceptable that pressure be brought to bear on pastors or that international bodies make financial aid dependent on the introduction of regulations inspired by gender ideology			1
" however , those very tools should be used to push for equality where it 's needed most			0
catholic leaders in @entity106 not only should speak out forcefully against discrimination and violence against @entity19 people but also should work toward guaranteeing their safety and acceptance			1
embrace same - sex marriage catholic people are relatively welcoming to the idea of same - sex marriage or civil unions -- especially in the @entity140			1
according to a 2010 survey of 1,015 @entity140 @entity1 adults , three - quarters support those practices			2
a poll last week found 42 % of @entity140 @entity1 support same - sex marriage , specifically			2
globally , 30 % of @entity1 support same - sex marriage , according to a poll released this year			2
the church , meanwhile , in its report on monday , continues to assert that " unions between people of the same sex can not be considered on the same footing as matrimony between man and woman			2
" @entity157 is n't truly welcoming to gay people until it updates that policy			1
regardless of public opinion , it 's the inclusive and fair thing to do			0
meanwhile , the church acknowledges " it has to be noted that there are cases in which mutual aid to the point of sacrifice constitutes a precious support in the life of the partners " in same - sex unions			2
to hold that belief , it needs to act on it			0
stop the firings of gay teachers it 's become a sadly common occurrence for gay and lesbian teachers at catholic schools to be fired when the administration learns that a man in @entity184 has a husband or that a woman in @entity187 becomes pregnant while in a same - sex relationship			2
" the discharged teachers , of course , are the most seriously injured , but so are all the people associated with the schools -- students , graduates , parents , and staff , " @entity189 , @entity190 wrote for the @entity191			2
" the catholic school system is diminished in the eyes of the public			0
and the church as a whole is made to suffer			2
" again , the emphasis should be on the students			0
what are they to think of institutions that would fire their role models simply because of who they are ? there are signs of hope			0
nuns from @entity216 , in @entity187 , where a lesbian teacher was fired , say they are rethinking their policies			0
" @entity88 has brought a sense of hope to our lives and encourages us to look at our @entity225 with new eyes , " sister @entity219 says in a letter posted on @entity221			0
" no , it is not likely that doctrine will change ; however the @entity88 emphasizes that the values of mercy , inclusion and compassion need to be included in our response to complex situations			0
" it 's unclear , however , whether the fired teacher , @entity236 , will be reinstated			0
a change.org petition in her support has 72,000 signatures			0
more - inclusive dialog should be celebrated , sure			0
but it should n't be conflated with actual acceptance .			0

the @entity1 issues a new statement on the inclusion of gay people
@entity249 says the statement is an advance -- but does n't go nearly far enough
