make way , instead , for a new way so show your handsome , or lovely , mug to the @entity6 -- a budding web movement that combines high - tech geekery with the human desire to be seen			1
" as personal drones find their way into more and more hands , folks have begun using the personal , unmanned aircraft , kitted out with video cameras , to add a little flare to the @entity6 's ubiquitous " look at me " self - shots			1
" let 's be honest , selfies are n't going anywhere , " said @entity20 , a community development manager at video site @entity21			1
" but the dramatic reveal aspect adds another level of interest			0
" there may be no such thing as a " dronie expert " just yet			1
but @entity32 does claim the distinction of coining the term			2
about two months ago , she saw that a friend had commented on a video posted to the site by tech entrepreneur @entity39			1
it was shot on @entity42 's @entity41 , starting with a closeup of @entity39 and two friends , then panning up and out to show the @entity42 skyline			2
the friend " proclaimed it a new kind of shot , " she said , " and i jumped in with the suggestion of ' dronie '			2
" a few more dronies popped up the following day , leading @entity32 to begin collecting them on a new @entity21 channel			1
from there , it started the march to becoming a web trend			2
a web trend with a silly name ? sure			2
but , hey ... it 's no " owling			0
" @entity61 : remote aerial photography @entity63 got into the action last month			0
at the @entity67 advertising festival in @entity68 , the social - media service garnered some free publicity using drones to create scenic @entity72 videos of employees with other festival attendees			0
the first was of " @entity77 " actor and social - media star @entity78 , who appears in a new @entity63 documentary			0
as these things go , some early web celebs are emerging in the dronie world			1
@entity84 family , @entity83 , @entity85 and their son , @entity86 , sold all their stuff and took off on a permanent road trip in their @entity90 bus in 2011			1
( both parents have jobs that let them work from anywhere )			0
they 're documenting the trip with often stunning photos on @entity96 and , somewhere along the way , got their own drone			1
voila ! the " first family " of dronies is born			2
there was the one three weeks ago from @entity103 in @entity104 , where the drone flies up to showcase the towering trees in the site 's old - growth forest			1
or their first , a vertigo - inducing zoom - out on @entity112 in @entity113 , the second - highest built bridge in the @entity115			0
it remains to be seen whether dronies will become just another flash in the pan on the fast - twitch @entity120 , or a more enduring web presence like the venerable animated @entity123			0
@entity32 says she 's seeing some momentum			0
" i 've definitely noticed more interest in using drones for photography and filmmaking , even amongst my friends , " she said			0
" drones just open up so many possibilities for interesting compositions and they 're a lot more accessible than some of the professional equipment that filmmakers have had to use in the past to get these kinds of shots			0

a new breed of selfie -- the " dronie " -- is hitting the web
drone owners are using the aircraft to show themselves
the term " dronie " was coined on video site @entity21
