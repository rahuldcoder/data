is it a slow leak that will grow into a cascade , or a minor drip easily plugged ? more and more , conservative republicans in @entity5 are breaking from a pledge they signed years earlier against any kind of tax increase or additional tax revenue			1
facing the so - called fiscal cliff of automatic tax hikes and deep across - the - board spending cuts at the end of the year , the @entity11 legislators are signaling their willingness to cut a deal with president @entity18 and @entity19 that would include more money for the government			1
poll : lawmakers wo n't act their age on fiscal cliff the overall numbers remain relatively small -- a handful of senators and @entity30 members -- but they include influential veterans such as sens. @entity32 of @entity33 and @entity34 of @entity35 , along with rep. @entity36			1
@entity36 has " tried to weasel out " of the pledge , anti-tax crusader @entity37 told @entity39 's @entity38 on monday			1
" i hope his wife understands commitments last a little longer than two years or something			0
" @entity37 said @entity36 knew when he signed it that he was pledging that " as long as you 're in @entity5 , you will rein in spending and reform government , not raise taxes			1
it 's not for 500 years or two generations			0
it 's only as long as you 're in the @entity30 or the @entity52			0
if he stayed too long , that 's his problem			0
" @entity55 : share your financial compromise stories on sunday , @entity34 declared on @entity57 , " we do n't generate enough revenue , " officially disagreeing with the @entity58 he signed at @entity37 's behest			1
others who have rejected the strict dogma of the @entity37 pledge include sens. @entity64 of @entity65 , @entity66 of @entity67 and @entity68 of @entity69 , as well as rep. @entity70 of @entity71 , who was elected in the @entity73 wave of 2010 and recently re-elected			1
@entity37 , who founded the conservative @entity74 , advocates shrinking government by cutting spending instead of raising taxes through higher rates or reforms			2
he sounded unconcerned monday about the @entity11 backlash , telling @entity39 that " no pledge taker has voted for a tax increase			2
" " you 've had some people discussing impure thoughts on national television , " @entity37 said			2
@entity37 : i 'll unseat pledge breakers at the @entity30 , spokesman @entity90 told reporters he hoped the " welcome " comments by some @entity11 represented " a difference in tone and approach to these problems			1
" to @entity39 chief political analyst @entity97 , the softening tone by some in the @entity11 was explained by new poll numbers that showed 45 % of @entity101 would blame @entity11 for failing to avoid the fiscal cliff , while 34 % would blame @entity18			1
the public shift comes after @entity18 won re-election and @entity19 increased their slim @entity52 majority and narrowed the @entity11 majority in the @entity30 in this month 's election			1
in what have been secret talks so far , @entity18 and @entity5 are seeking to revive a possible " grand bargain " to cut the chronic federal deficits and debt			1
without a deal , tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 -- when @entity114 was president -- will expire , raising rates for everyone starting in january			1
in addition , spending cuts would reduce spending on the military , national parks , the @entity123 and other important government services			0
however , the government and @entity5 still would have time to prevent draconian effects from the fiscal cliff when a new @entity5 convenes in january			1
@entity18 promotes his fiscal cliff solution @entity130 , a senior fellow in governance studies at the @entity132 , called that a form of brinksmanship best avoided			1
" to be sure , no one believes that non-agreement by december 31 would be the end of the story			0
after a period of finger - pointing , discussions would resume , " he wrote last week in a @entity140 opinion piece			2
" but equally , no one knows how the failure to reach agreement before the end of 2012 would affect the dynamics of the negotiations			2
" in addition , " we can be reasonably sure ... that national and global markets would react adversely and that businesses , which are already retreating from planned investments in new plant and equipment , would become even more uncertain and risk - averse			2
" the @entity39 / @entity159 poll released monday also showed that a solid majority of respondents -- two - thirds -- supports the @entity19 stance that any agreement should include a mix of spending cuts and tax increases			1
of that total , @entity11 favor such an approach by 52 % -44 %			0
in particular , @entity18 and @entity19 insist that wealthy @entity101 , so far identified as those with income higher than $ 200,000 for individuals or $ 250,000 for families , should pay more taxes than they do now so that rates for everyone else stay the same			2
however , the outgoing @entity5 in a lame - duck session for the rest of the year , as well as the new @entity5 to be seated in january , include large numbers of @entity11 who signed the @entity37 pledge			1
come january , there will be 39 senators , including @entity32 and @entity34 , and 219 @entity30 members who endorsed it			0
trending : @entity34 says he 'd break no - tax ' pledge ' the @entity30 total constitutes a narrow majority in the 435 - seat chamber , though some members have denounced their allegiance to the pledge			1
some congressional conservatives sought to deflect attention from the @entity37 pledge on monday , focusing instead on the need to work out a deal that included concessions by @entity19			1
" the goal is to solve the problem , " insisted rep. @entity197 , the no. 3 house @entity11 in the incoming @entity5			2
he rejected @entity18 's call for letting tax rates on income over $ 250,000 return to higher levels of the 1990s , telling @entity39 " that does n't solve the problem " because " you do nothing about the growth of government			1
" long a defining difference between @entity19 and @entity11 , the tax issue has stymied efforts to work out a deficit deal for the past two years			1
@entity18 and @entity30 speaker @entity214 came close to agreement last year before conservative rejection of any increased revenue and liberal resistance to entitlement reform scuttled the effort			1
@entity214 , the @entity221 @entity11 who has emerged as party leader in the deficit talks , agrees to the concept of increased revenue , though he and @entity52 minority leader @entity228 of @entity229 both remain opposed to actually raising tax rates			1
instead , they propose broad tax reform that will lower rates while eliminating unspecified loopholes and exemptions to spur economic growth that they say will result in more overall government revenue			2
" it 's fair to ask my party to put revenue on the table			0
we 're below historic averages , " @entity34 told @entity57			0
" i will not raise tax rates to do it			0
if you cap deductions around the $ 30,000 , $ 40,000 range , you can raise $ 1 trillion in revenue , and the people who lose their deductions are the upper - income @entity101			2
" at the same time , @entity34 and other conservative lawmakers demand that @entity19 agree to significant reforms in entitlement programs such as @entity259 and @entity260 , the government - run health care programs for senior citizens , the disabled and the poor			0
" i will violate the pledge , long story short , for the good of the country , only if @entity19 will do entitlement reform , " @entity34 said			0
on the same program , @entity19 sen. @entity270 of @entity271 said some changes to @entity259 are needed , but he ruled out any reforms to @entity275 , the national retirement plan , saying it is a separately funded system that " does not add a penny to our debt			0
" noting opposition to entitlement reforms by traditional @entity19 allies such as organized labor , @entity270 said everyone has to realize that some changes are needed in @entity259 and @entity260			0
fiscal cliff tax deal : getting to $ 1 trillion " those who say ' do n't touch it , do n't change it ' are ignoring the obvious , " said the @entity52 's no. 2 @entity288 , adding that " we can make meaningful reforms in @entity259 and @entity260 without compromising the integrity of the program , making sure that the beneficiaries are not paying the price for it , except perhaps the high - income beneficiaries			1
that to me is a reasonable approach			0
" however , @entity270 balked at one proposal sought by @entity11 -- to slowly raise the eligibility age for @entity259 above the current level of 65			0
" what happens to the early retiree who needs health insurance before that person 's eligible for @entity259 ? " @entity270 asked			0
" my concern about raising that @entity259 retirement age is there will be gaps in coverage or coverage that 's way too expensive for seniors to purchase			0
" @entity34 rejected @entity270 's point , saying the same change instituted in @entity275 has worked			0
he also called for adjusting benefits based on the personal wealth of recipients , so that those with more money have to pay more for services			0
@entity37 said @entity19 will never agree to the negotiating position of @entity34 and other @entity11 , calling the demand for entitlement reforms akin to a " pink unicorn that does n't exist			2

@entity37 said monday his group would " certainly highlight who has kept their commitment and who has n't " when re-election time comes			2
" the key here is whether or not the @entity11 will move away from the ideologically rigid position , which has been the @entity37 pledge , " @entity19 sen. @entity341 of @entity342 told @entity343 on sunday			2
" you 've got to raise additional revenues , including tax rates on the wealthy			0
they have to go up			0
either real tax rates or effective tax rates , there are ways of doing that			0
