-- leading golfers @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 are all " @entity8 "			1
so it was entirely appropriate that @entity10 celebrated his win at the @entity12 by posing for the cameras with his best impression of the trend that has gone viral on the internet -- the @entity18 golfer slouched on the green with a slightly vacant expression on his face with the tournament trophy by his side			1
before @entity28 ' win , which earned him a place at the masters and a winner 's check of $ 1.16 million , the @entity18 @entity25 event had been buzzing with laughter after the likes of @entity2 et @entity36 posted pictures of themselves on @entity38 mimicking @entity40 's unfortunate photograph of himself looking rather disinterested in a @entity42 classroom surrounded by children , while performing a charity visit last week			1
" what can i say , i was tired , my back hurt from sitting on the floor , and we were talking about relaxation and focusing , " tweeted @entity40 , explaining his lackadaisical posture and the less than animated expression on his face			1
too late -- # @entity8 was quickly trending after a succession of leading golfers gently poked fun at their sporting colleague on @entity38			1
sitting in front of the @entity59 car from the @entity61 television series that he owns , @entity3 tweeted : " just # dufnering in the garage ! ! " other sports starts quickly got in on the act , peppering @entity40 's @entity38 timeline with their own version of the online phenomenon -- former tennis player @entity69 even tweeted a picture of his dog " @entity8 "			1
given points had made just two cuts in nine starts this year , the 36 - year - old was not surprisingly only too happy to oblige the photographers with his own take on golf 's new craze after his win on sunday at the @entity81			1
" you know , again , i want to win , " @entity10 told the @entity25 website as he more seriously outlined his future ambitions			1
" i want to win more than once			2
i want to have the opportunity to win majors , i want to play in @entity87			2
these are things i want to do and i know i 'm capable of doing			2
" so i never doubt that i can do it			2
i certainly get down and frustrated when i make two of nine cuts			2
that 's not making you feel real great about yourself			0
'' remarkably points earned his place at the @entity95 thanks to some help from his mother 's putter as he finished one shot ahead of compatriot @entity103 and @entity105 's @entity104			0
" i 've been hitting it better and better , and i saw @entity113 for a putting lesson , '' added @entity28 , who holed a 13 - foot par putt at the 72nd hole to to clinch victory after thunderstorms had halted play in the closing stretch			0
" gave me a couple things , changed the putter , boom , felt great , and here i am			0
" so , the thing about it , is i never count myself out			0
i never just chalk it up , like , ' oh , this year is over with			0
' i 've never ever felt like that			0
i was just grinding , just trying to wait and try to find that one thing that was like , boom , there it is and there i go			0
" fortunately , it was this week and i capitalized on it			0
" @entity2 , who announced during the tournament that he would postpone a @entity131 charity trip to @entity132 in order to add this week 's @entity134 to his schedule , finished tied for 45th -- 12 shots behind points			1
he is still seeking his first victory this season , having fallen to no. 2 in the world rankings behind @entity142 .			0
