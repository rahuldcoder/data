@entity0 -- @entity4 gov. @entity3 's survival in a recall election sparked by steps to weaken public unions could embolden fellow @entity8 in other states to seek similar measures			1
" he 's one of the @entity8 governors who has been out on the point on this issue about whether there are excesses in public employee unions in terms of their pension plans or health care plans and so forth , " noted @entity1 senior political analyst @entity11 , calling the topic a " very , very hot issue " across the country			1
at least 19 states have passed or considered legislation involving collective bargaining rights in the past two years , according to the @entity27			1
the @entity4 recall effort was spurred by a @entity3 - backed @entity8 measure , signed into law in march 2011 , to limit the collective bargaining rights of state worker unions			1
during a bitter fight over the law last year , @entity34 legislators left the capital to prevent a quorum , and tens of thousands of protesters converged on the @entity41 building in what became an occupation			2
after the law was signed , @entity34 and their labor allies immediately began a recall effort that eventually led to tuesday 's vote			0
the @entity48 in @entity4 , which worked in favor of the recall , defended the effort to oust @entity3			1
" we wanted a different outcome , but @entity4 forced the governor to answer for his efforts to divide the state and punish hardworking people , " the group said in a statement			2
" their resolve has inspired a nation to follow their lead and stand up for the values of hard work , unity , and decency that we believe in			0
we hope @entity3 heard @entity4 : nobody wants divisive policies			2
" @entity34 complained that @entity3 benefited from a huge spending advantage due to tens of millions of dollars for his cause brought in from outside the state			0
voters were inundated with campaign ads and door - to - door canvassing in the fierce battle , which was cited for increasing political intolerance in @entity4			1
to @entity80 of @entity81 , a conservative advocacy group that pumped more than $ 10 million into the state backing @entity3 's policies , the recall campaign sent a message that the @entity8 machine and its backers will help colleagues willing to take on the tough battles			0
" i think every governor , every state legislator around the country is looking at @entity4 , and they 're going , ' ok , if i got the courage to stand up and do what i think is right to get my state moving again ... will someone have my back ? ' " @entity80 said before tuesday 's vote			2
" and hopefully the answer is going to be , you bet			0
" @entity3 's message -- that state workers unions had too much power and were preventing necessary budget cuts -- resonated with voters , @entity11 said			1
after spending a few days in @entity4 during the campaign , " i can tell you a lot of people , small business people in particular , were talking about that these unions are costing too much money , " he added			1
" and it was not about the ads. it was not about the ground game			0
it was people just deciding they could n't afford it			0
" the victory by @entity3 is " a substantial defeat for labor , for public employees unions , and a substantial victory for those who have been trying to curb them " @entity11 concluded			1
president @entity125 easily won @entity4 in 2008 , but the @entity8 victory tuesday now puts the state in play in the november general election , analysts agreed			1
@entity8 strategist @entity130 noted @entity125 mostly stayed out of race that was so important to the labor movement			0
@entity125 publicly backed @entity3 's opponent , @entity34 mayor @entity133 of @entity134 , but neglected to stop in @entity4 to campaign with him even though he was next door in @entity136 last week			2
" i have a hard time seeing big labor returning to @entity4 this fall to put in a lot of effort for president @entity125 since he did n't show up there for them this year , " said @entity130 , a @entity1 contributor			1
@entity11 concurred , saying : " if the president had gone in and been loyal to labor , i think labor would be more loyal to him			2
whether he can count on them under these circumstances , i 'm not sure			0
" @entity48 president @entity147 told reporters wednesday there were " mixed feelings " about @entity125 's involvement			1
asked if campaigning by the president would have made a difference , @entity147 said he did n't know			0
" this is just the opening shot of a battle that is going to go on until november , " he said of the tuesday vote			0
@entity159 gov. @entity158 , who chairs the @entity160 , told @entity1 that @entity4 voters were tired of continuous recall efforts by @entity34 since the 2010 election that brought @entity3 to the governor 's office			1
" i think it was overreach by the labor unions , " @entity158 said			0
" this is the third recall			0
they tried a judge , legislators , and now governor , and i think people realize this is too much			0
" democratic state sen. @entity176 agreed , noting on @entity1 that " people are sick of recalls in @entity4			2
" " the exit polling shows that people in @entity4 support public employees strongly , they support the right of collective bargaining , " @entity176 said			1
" by sending gov. @entity3 back to the governor 's residence , obviously i think what people are saying is not so much about the policies , just that they 've had it with recalls and they feel very strongly that removing gov. @entity3 from office right now for what he 's done is n't the right way to go			0
" @entity11 warned @entity8 , including certain presidential candidate @entity194 , to avoid overplaying the @entity4 result by launching a broad attack on public unions			1
" i think he can certainly give voice to a lot of the restlessness and resentments and that sort of thing that are stirring against some of the excesses in labor unions , " @entity11 said of @entity194 , " but what i hope he does not do is declare war on public employee unions			1
i think that would be a terrible mistake			0
there are some things that need to be fixed , but we do n't need a war			0
" analysis : @entity4 now tougher for @entity125 , but still uphill climb for @entity194 what 's at stake in @entity4 ? opinion : @entity8 should n't get cocky over vote			2

at least 19 states have considered collective bargaining measures in the past two years
