-- for years the message was simple : use condoms to prevent @entity3			1
but if you are at high risk of contracting the virus , health experts want you to consider an additional strategy -- taking a pill every day to reduce your chance of being infected			1
new guidelines published by the @entity12 say pre-exposure prophylaxis , or @entity14 , should be taken daily by people who are at high risk for contracting @entity3			1
the recommendation is based on several large national and international studies , which were done in varying at - risk populations , such as gay and bisexual men , heterosexual couples where one person is hiv - positive ( the other is not ) and injection drug users			1
the studies all showed that this drug can help reduce infection rates by more than 90 % when taken daily			1
" while a vaccine or cure may one day end the @entity3 epidemic , @entity14 is a powerful tool that has the potential to alter the course of the @entity44 hiv epidemic today , " @entity30 , director of the @entity12 's @entity31 for @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 , said in a statement			1
" these guidelines represent an important step toward fully realizing the promise of @entity14			0
we should add to this momentum , working to ensure that @entity14 is used by the right people , in the right way , in the right circumstances			0
" according to the guidelines , those circumstances would be anyone who : has had sex without a condom ; is not infected with @entity3 but is in a sexual relationship with an hiv - infected partner ; is a gay or bisexual man who has had a sexually transmitted disease within the last six months and is not in a mutually exclusive relationship with a recently tested @entity3 - negative partner ; is a heterosexual man or woman who does not always use condoms when having sex with partners already at risk , and who is n't in a mutually exclusive relationship with a recently tested @entity3 - negative partner ; or has injected drugs or shared drug paraphernalia in the past six months in 2012 , the @entity76 approved @entity77 , a pill that combines two antiretroviral drugs for the prevention of @entity3			1
it was first approved in 2004 as an @entity3 treatment and is still the only @entity76 - approved medication for @entity14			2
a month 's supply can cost you anywhere from $ 1,300 to $ 1,700 , according to @entity86			0
but insurance may cover the bill			0
to be effective , this pill must be taken every day			0
dr. @entity90 , an immunologist who has been at the forefront of hiv / aids research for decades , called it a highly effective approach to preventing the spread of the virus that causes @entity32			0
" ( it 's ) one that benefits not only the individual patient at risk for hiv infection but also will help to reduce the number of new hiv infections across the @entity44 , " said @entity90 , director of the @entity97 at the @entity98			1
" it should be used together with -- and complementary to -- condoms and not as a substitute for condoms			0
" the new guidelines replace interim ones published two years ago ; they provide a comprehensive place where doctors and patients can find information on @entity14 and come with a supplement that provides checklists for physicians , giving them step - by - step support for dealing with patients who might be considered for prophylactic treatment			0
" @entity14 is a new approach to hiv prevention that requires continuing collaboration between patients and providers , as effectiveness requires adherence to daily medication and regular medical visits for monitoring , counseling and testing , " said dr. @entity122 , an epidemiologist in @entity12 's @entity123 who led the development of the guidelines			2
" individuals will have to decide with their doctor if @entity14 is right for them , but for some , this may offer a much - needed strategy to help protect themselves from hiv infection			2
" there are 1.1 million people in the @entity44 living with @entity3 , according to the @entity12			1
an estimated nearly one in six do not know they 're infected			0
men who have sex with men are the hardest hit -- while they make up 2 % of the @entity44 population , they account for 63 % of all new infections each year , according to the @entity12			2
heterosexuals make up 25 % of all new annual infections ; 9 % are injection drug users			0
" hiv infection is preventable , yet every year we see some 50,000 new hiv infections in the @entity44 , " said dr. @entity155 , the @entity12 's director , in a statement			2
" @entity14 , used along with other prevention strategies , has the potential to help at - risk individuals protect themselves and reduce new hiv infections in the @entity44			1

@entity12 recommends at - risk *groups* take @entity77 daily to prevent @entity3 infection
studies show pill can help reduce infection rates by more than 90 % when taken daily
health experts say they hope this will " alter the course of the @entity44 hiv epidemic "
