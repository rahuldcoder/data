they 're listening as we speak -- logging every word , tracing every step			1
even tonight , while you sleep under your hotel - monogrammed duvet , rest assured that 20 stories below , in some undisclosed location , researchers are hard at work documenting your whims and wishes -- loves biking ! hates bananas ! -- trying to crack the profound mystery that is you			1
how much do they know ? they want to know everything : your relationship status , your income , your allergies , your preferred brand of toothpaste , how you like your eggs -- all those sundry habits , peeves and predilections , even the ones you did n't know you had			1
hotels have always kept logs on their guests , tracking previous stays , comments and complaints , even which pay - per - view movies you ordered			1
" we write down everything , " says @entity40 , area director , @entity41 , for @entity33 and general manager of the @entity43			2
so when the bellman casually inquires , " where are we off to today , folks ? " no doubt your reply will be fed into your ever - expanding profile			2
sometimes this " research " can take on questionable ethical dimensions			2
one veteran general manager told me his staff are n't above going through guests ' trash			1
@entity57 : @entity59 's best hotels but fishing around is not a recent development			2
what has changed , in this brazen new world , is the sheer amount of data that hotels now collect on guests , and the often startlingly personal nature of that data			1
with the explosion of social networking , and our increasingly unguarded presence online , profiling guests has become a lot easier , and a hell of a lot more effective			1
a representative for a prestigious @entity79 hotel recalls welcoming a first - time guest to the property			1
" we knew very little about her before she checked in , so we searched for her online and discovered she had a dog named @entity87 , " the rep says			2
" when she arrived , there was a little doggy gift waiting in her room , with a note card that said ' @entity87 misses you			2
' " creepy ? cute ? you be the judge			2
prying is the new pampering			0
the payoff , hospitality executives say , is the ability to tailor service to a guest without the guest 's initiating any requests herself			0
under the old model , a guest would have to volunteer that she loves tennis and might enjoy a lesson			0
now , ideally , she need no longer say a thing ; the staff has already sussed her out and booked a 9 o'clock with the pro. @entity57 : where to rent celebrity homes as for that quaint " pre-arrival questionnaire " they used to send to incoming guests ? nearly obsolete , except at the most traditional properties			1
who has the time to fill one out ? besides , for many of us , our identities , preferences and proclivities are already posted online , and ripe for the culling			0
for hotel companies , social media has essentially become a sanctioned form of eavesdropping			1
" hotels have trained their staff to be intense listeners and mine information about their guests			1
this gives them a whole new realm in which to listen , " says @entity133 , ceo of @entity128 ( formerly the president and @entity135 )			0
at @entity143 , reservation teams look up incoming guests on @entity144 , work - related sites and blogs , then draw up detailed profiles ( photos included ) to distribute to top - level managers			1
the @entity148 , meanwhile , googles every guest two weeks before arrival			0
" we actually create a little story about them -- just a paragraph or so -- and share that with the heads of each department at our daily @entity158 ( next - day arrivals ) meeting , " says general manager @entity155			1
( you did n't know they had a little story about you , did you ? ) it 's not rocket science , @entity166 adds , and it does n't cost them a thing			0
" the first page of @entity171 results is usually sufficient			1
we 're not digging into every last detail of someone 's life -- we just want a picture of who they are			1
" @entity59 's strangest buildings other hotels invest more money and manpower in tracking guests online			1
the @entity183 in @entity184 was an early adopter of the powerful @entity187 software , which aids in " customer relationship management , " or @entity189			0
" @entity187 acts as a one - stop shop for searching guests on @entity171 , @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity144 and other channels , " explains @entity190 , the @entity191 's director of guest relations			1
" it gives us the power to get to know our guests , beyond what they 'd think to share with us			1
" as @entity190 sees it , guests are looking not only for great amenities but also for " connection " -- with a staff that can intuit their tastes and desires , including unspoken ones			1
" previously , we did all our profiling via manual online searches , and only vips and guests paying a certain rate were researched , " @entity190 says			1
" now every reservation is processed by @entity187			0
" in today 's social - mediated paradigm , wherein everyone lives in public , all guests can be treated like celebrities			1
this proves especially useful in orchestrating what hotels call " surprise - and - delight moments			0
" so if you happen to tweet " just arrived @ @entity227 for anniversary weekend ! " do n't be shocked if a bottle of wine appears at turn - down			0
( be surprised and delighted , but do n't be shocked			0
) " a guest 's @entity144 feed can provide information that they are n't even telling you -- and then you can really surprise them , " notes @entity133			1
" for instance , maybe the hotel will find out the guest is an advocate for lgbt rights , in which case the staff can personalize the welcome amenity by including a magazine they would identify with			1
something unique and personal that says , ' this is just for you			0
' " cranks and paranoiacs will surely see all this probing and profiling as a sign of the apocalypse , or at least a serious incursion into their privacy			0
( it 's worth noting that , because of privacy regulations in the @entity262 , companies are less likely to gather personal information online , so these practices are more common at @entity41 - based and independent hotels			1
) some may pine for the days when travel could be refreshingly anonymous , when hotels were at least purportedly about discretion above all else			0
but would we really want to go back ? the fact is , profiling works -- most of the time			1
who would n't want their hotel to know , without even asking , what type of pillow to leave on the bed , which magazines to leave on the coffee table , what brand of juice to put in the mini-bar ? who does n't enjoy being surprised and delighted ? and just so we 're clear , we 're talking about hotels here			1
hotels -- where , discreet as one might hope to be , it 's impossible not to leave an identifiable footprint			1
long before @entity144 this was so			0
you might hang that flimsy privacy sign on your door , but you ca n't hide			0
you ca n't " turn off cookies			0
" the staff 's eyes and ears are everywhere			2
( for @entity299 's sake , they 're going through your trash ! ) trust me , they know plenty about you already , and they did n't need a search engine to find it			2
the key , as one hotel manager puts it , is " to act on that knowledge without calling undue attention to it			2
" if your profile says you requested the @entity314 on a previous visit , a skilled desk clerk will simply have it delivered again this time , without comment			0
nobody wants to hear the words " and we see from our deep background check that sir enjoys the journal " ! no , we prefer to think this stuff happens by magic , not by design ; that the staff are just incredibly good at their jobs , not following a computer - generated set of directives -- which , frankly , seems like cheating			1
bear with me as we compare your hotel to @entity332			2
one would like to believe that @entity332 knows what you want -- and whether you 've earned it -- based on his compassion , care and superior powers of intuition			2
what you do n't want to discover is that @entity332 's elves have been monitoring your @entity171 , @entity343 and @entity344 searches for gift ideas , then poring over your @entity195 wall to see if you 've been good enough to deserve them			1
of course , there 's a delicate line between intuitiveness and intrusiveness , between " personalization " and , well , stalking			0
consider this curious tale from @entity184 restaurateur @entity355 , who literally wrote the book on hospitality			0
( it 's called " setting the @entity359 , " and it 's required reading for anyone in the industry			0
) last june -- on @entity362 -- @entity355 returned to his room at the @entity364 in @entity365 , @entity366 , to find a framed photo of his wife and children beside the bed			1
" on the frame it said ' @entity362 from your friends at the @entity364 , ' " he recalls			0
" they 'd gone online to find a picture of us			2
" to me that sounds neither surprising nor delightful , but downright terrifying			0
i 'm trying to picture my own reaction : you hunted down my family ? ! ? leave them out of this , you monsters ! ! but @entity355 , to his credit , found it touching			0
" i almost started crying , " he says			0
" that photo is now on my dresser at home			0
i thought it was a genuinely thoughtful gesture			0
look , anyone can give you a plate of cookies , and sure , that feels nice			0
but this was n't off - the - rack			0
it was about customization -- one - size - fits - one			2

social media and @entity171 have made gathering information on hotel guests easier
hotel staff often collect information about guests to anticipate their needs
guests might *shudder* about what hoteliers -- and everyone else -- can find out about them
