@entity1 the @entity0 jumped into the same - sex marriage debate again , deciding friday to hear arguments this spring on the question of whether states have the right to ban same - sex couples from getting married			1
it 's expected to hammer out a decision on one of the most controversial social issues by june when the 2016 presidential race will be well underway , forcing the debate into full view during what 's expected to be a crowded and diverse @entity18 primary			1
it 's not an issue that establishment @entity18 are eager to drag into the spotlight			2
on the national level , the party is increasingly reluctant to focus on social issues , especially after the 2012 debacle over @entity28 's rape comments and as polling continues to show a majority of @entity31 support same - sex marriage			1
a recent @entity2 / @entity34 survey indicates that 57 % of @entity31 think gays and lesbians have a constitutional right to get married			0
off the table or on ? some @entity18 strategists say quietly that a decision could bring some finality and take the issue off the table well before the election , while others say it could reignite the debate			2
" i fear there could be a bigger fight within the @entity18 because of a @entity0 decision than there would be without one , " said @entity48 , a former congressman from @entity49 and an adviser to @entity52 's 2012 campaign			1
" i do n't want to see a fight over this issue , because i think it 's evolving on its own state by state			0
" he added : " i would guess social conservatives would take up umbrage , make it a divisive issue , and force every @entity18 candidate to go on record saying what they really believe			2
" it 's a tough issue to talk about for @entity18 , consultants say , because no matter what position they take , they 're going to get in trouble with one side of the party or the other			2
former @entity78 gov. @entity77 , who adamantly stood against same - sex marriage during his unsuccessful 1994 gubernatorial run , struck a conciliatory tone last week when @entity78 became the 36th state to legalize same - sex marriage			1
" we live in a democracy , and regardless of our disagreements , we have to respect the rule of law , " @entity77 said in a statement , calling for " respect for the good people on all sides of the gay and lesbian marriage issue			0
" @entity48 said that @entity77 's statement likely reflects the position of a majority of @entity18 candidates and elected officials on the issue			0
" they 're not quite ready to endorse gay marriage , but they really do n't want to crusade against it like they used to , " he said			0
" they 're looking for ways to describe their position that do n't put them directly at odds with supporters of same - sex marriage			1
" ' @entity113 consequences ' opponents of same - sex marriage , however , argue that anyone who thinks the fight will slowly die down is highly misguided			1
@entity118 , president of the @entity119 , said a @entity0 decision that reverses same - sex marriage bans will be " a frontal assault on the religious liberty of all @entity31			1
" " there are going to be profound consequences , " he said			0
" if the @entity0 rules , it will be just like @entity127 all over again			0
" with the 2016 @entity18 field spanning a wide ideological spectrum , there 's a sizable crop of potential candidates who 've signaled that they 're ready for a fight			2
sen. @entity134 spelled out a 10 - point agenda for the new @entity18 @entity136 in a speech monday that also read like a potential presidential platform			2
one of his themes was the need to " rein in judicial activism , " pointing to federal court rulings on same - sex marriage			1
" the @entity144 makes clear marriage is a question for the states , " he said			0
" it 's not a question for a bunch of unelected federal judges who may disagree with the democratic views of the people who live in the @entity31			0
" @entity155 last fall threatened to leave the @entity18 if @entity18 do n't take a stronger stand against a wave of acceptance			0
" if the @entity18 want to lose guys like me and a whole bunch of still @entity164 - fearing , @entity160 - believing people , go ahead and just abdicate on this issue , " he said			2
he seemed to soften his tone a little bit , writing in his newly released book that the idea that " same - sex marriage is destroying society is actually greatly overstated , " adding that @entity174 who get divorced " have as much to answer for as do those who militantly push to redefine marriage			1
" still , while conservative candidates are more vocal about standing on principle , strategists say it 's not as likely that they 'll start a war over same - sex marriage in the face of issues involving the economy , terrorism , and health care -- especially when the tide has rolled in favor of same - sex marriage at such a rapid pace in the last couple of years			1
" it 's not 2004			0
gay marriage is not going to determine the outcome of presidential election like it did in @entity200 , " said @entity18 strategist @entity192 , referring to the surge of @entity18 who showed up to the polls to approve same - sex marriage bans in nearly a dozen states a decade ago			1
the turn - out helped tip the scales for @entity204 's re-election			0
" the issue may come up in the primary , but i do n't think anyone wants this to be the hallmark of this campaign , " she said .			0

the @entity0 decided friday to hear same - sex marriage arguments this year
that could lead to a major decision during the early 2016 presidential race
strategists say a decision could be welcome news to some @entity18 , while others are ready to fight
