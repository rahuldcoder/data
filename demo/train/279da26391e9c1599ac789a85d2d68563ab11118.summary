-- the job ad listed the many unusual requirements for director of operations -- and still , a few dozen people answered it and set up video interviews : -- must be able to work 135 - plus hours a week , it said			1
-- must working standing up for most hours , often overnight			0
-- eating depends on when the " associate " eats			0
-- able to manage 10 to 15 projects at one time			0
( there are many , many more tough demands on time , emotions and mental skills			0
) -- and the work for @entity20 ( there 's the first clue ) is pro bono			2
but the people behind the ad say billions of people do it every day			1
if you go to the online version of the job ad , there is a link that goes to a video for # @entity35 , a @entity37 campaign on the @entity38			1
the video is a reminder that a mother 's " impact is endless			1
and so is her job description , " @entity38 says on the website			1
as you might guess , when the interviewer discusses the unique requirements for the job , many a head is shaken and words like " crazy " and " insane " are dispersed			2
eventually , there is the reveal of the true job title -- mom -- and the sentimental among us have to brush away the tears as the tributes to moms flow			1
the video had been viewed through @entity58 more than 4 million times since it was posted monday			1
@entity60 , an associate creative director for @entity62 - based @entity61 , the advertising agency behind the spot , said that because @entity37 is such an important day for @entity38 , her team went in with big goals			1
" the topic of mom is so heartfelt and so relatable , and we just wanted to make a video that inspired meaningful connections , " she said			2
" we 're incredibly pleased with how people are connecting with it			2
" she shared some details about how the ad came to be			2
@entity60 went home to @entity77 where she spent time with her brother , his wife and their newborn , the couple 's second child			2
and , she said , it really hit home when she witnessed how hard being a mother was for her sister - in - law			0
when she went back to @entity62 , the planning for the @entity37 campaign was just beginning			1
she pitched the idea that many people talk about how hard being a mother is , but actually showing it would be a different take on a holiday campaign			1
@entity60 said as the concept took shape , a team of moms from the two companies weighed in to give it its humor and authenticity			0
" they took the idea to what it 's become , " she said			0
so @entity61 placed an ad in newspapers and online			0
@entity110 ads linked to a fictitious job description page			1
hundreds of thousands of people saw the ad online or in the papers , but only 24 answered it			1
that kind of proves the point that people think the job is too tough , @entity60 said			1
then the @entity61 team set up interviews with people who were told they would be helping evaluate the job ad by video conference			1
the man who described the ad to them actually was an improv actor			0
some of the test group came to an office in @entity129 while others used a webcam from home , @entity60 said			0
only one person actually started to see the ruse while there			0
the others sat through about 15 minutes of interviewing before they were let in on the real message			0
" everyone [ who ] came in had no idea had no idea what they were reacting to , " @entity60 said			0
" all of those reactions are completely authentic			0
" so , will there be something similar for @entity148 ? @entity60 : " all i can say is fathers are just as important , and it 's something we 're already excited about			2

the ad was fake , but it reminds people how hard one important person 's job is
hundreds of thousands of people saw the ad , but only 24 expressed interest in being hired
people brought in to help evaluate the description were *surprised* to hear the real job title
the video for the @entity37 campaign has been seen more than 4 million times
