-- one congressman says it 's " shocking " how the @entity4 administration is now using the @entity5			1
but a senator says the secret court order for @entity9 phone records is " lawful			1
" the @entity5 , the landmark law born out of the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , is at the center of an emerging controversy thursday over how the @entity4 administration obtained a secret court order for phone records from the @entity16 from april to july this year			1
the administration is accused of making a secret interpretation and going too far in that interpretation of the anti-terrorism law , specifically a portion called @entity22			1
experts wonder whether the revelation of the secret order will prompt a public outcry and congressional hearings			2
and a digital civil liberties lawyer argues the government can no longer claim state secrecy privileges in federal lawsuits seeking to shut down domestic surveillance programs			0
even before this week 's @entity16 controversy , privacy advocates had long criticized @entity22 as vastly expanding the @entity36 's power to spy on @entity9			1
the @entity5 ( pdf ) the @entity16 case apparently marks a difference between presidents @entity4 and @entity40 in obtaining phone records , according to @entity42 , a former federal computer crime prosecutor under both administrations			1
the @entity40 administration also collected phone logs -- the same sort of " metadata " that the @entity4 administration is gathering from @entity16 -- and even conducted wiretaps , but it did so without getting a court order			1
now the @entity4 administration is invoking the @entity5 's @entity50 -- as well as the @entity51 -- as the basis for a secret court order demanding @entity16 records that show originating and terminating phone numbers , their location , time and duration			1
the @entity51 court 's proceedings , held in @entity60 , are secret			2
" it 's pretty broad authority that @entity22 gives the @entity36 , " said @entity42 , who worked in the @entity61 between 2007 and early 2011			1
" it 's important to note that this order does not permit the collection of the content of communications , so it 's not a wiretap , " said @entity42 , who now works for a @entity65 - based law firm that represents @entity66 , @entity67 and other companies			1
" that 's important because if you 're collecting content , then there is a privacy interest of individuals , " @entity42 said thursday			2
" with these business records -- what the government is calling telephony metadata -- there is not the same expectation of privacy			0
" presumably this is going into a large and sophisticated data - mining database , looking for patterns and call activities " relating to terrorism , @entity42 added			2
one legal scholar wonders if the @entity16 case will provoke a groundswell of outrage			0
" now they have taken the calls of every single citizen from @entity16 , " said @entity98 , a law professor at @entity99			1
" at what point do citizens stand up and say this is the tipping point ? we 're getting toward authoritarian power			1
" the problem is , every administration , every politician will say we 're getting something from this , " @entity98 said			2
" you can make that argument to remove all civil liberties			0
" the revelation of the court order could help plaintiffs and their attorneys such as the @entity120 in their federal lawsuits seeking to shut down government domestic surveillance programs			0
with the revelation of the surveillance of @entity16 , the government can no longer argue state secrecy privileges in those lawsuits , said @entity128 , staff attorney at the foundation , a digital civil liberties organization			0
" the cat is out of the bag now , or they will have a difficult time convincing a judge that this information is still secret , " @entity128 said			0
about the secret court order against @entity16 , @entity128 said : " i do n't know of any single other publicly disclosed order in the history of the @entity9 that could have had the far - reaching effect that this one has			1
we 're probably talking about millions of people			0
" there 's no question in my mind that this type of order is illegal , " @entity128 said , adding that @entity144 ought to hold hearings on the @entity16 case			2
the secret court order also is drawing strong criticism from within @entity4 's @entity154			1
former vice president @entity155 wrote on @entity156 : " is it just me , or is secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous ? " added sen. @entity163 , @entity164 , who serves on the @entity165 : " while i can not corroborate the details of this particular report , this sort of wide - scale surveillance should concern all of us and is the kind of government overreach i 've said @entity9 would find shocking			1
" @entity163 and sen. @entity168 , @entity169 , who also serves on the @entity165 , accused attorney general @entity170 in a letter last year of making " secret interpretations of public laws			0
" " we believe most @entity9 would be stunned to learn the details of how these secret court opinions have interpreted section 215 of the @entity5 , " which deals with " business records , " they wrote			1
but sen. @entity180 , @entity181 , described the @entity51 court order as " the exact three - month renewal of what has been the case for the past seven years			2
" " this renewal is carried out by the @entity51 court under the business records section of the @entity5			2
it has been briefed to @entity144 , " @entity180 said			0
" terrorists will come after us if they can , and the only thing that we have to deter this is good intelligence to understand that a plot has been hatched and to get there before they get to us			0
" many analysts cited how federal surveillance of phone records could prove useful			0
" think of the @entity207 bombings , " said @entity203 , a @entity0 contributor and former homeland security adviser to president @entity40			0
phone records could have proved valuable in tracking the suspects in that terror attack , @entity203 said			0
" what numbers were they calling ? who were their associates ? you may find witnesses , " @entity203 said			0
sen. @entity218 of @entity219 , the @entity165 's ranking @entity220 , said the surveillance is nothing new			0
the gathering of phone records " has proved meritorious because we have gathered significant information on bad guys and only on bad guys over the years , " he said .			0
