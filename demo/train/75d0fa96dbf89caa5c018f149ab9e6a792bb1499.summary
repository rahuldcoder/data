on @entity1 , the @entity0 may be trading bitter accusations with @entity3 over @entity4			1
but in space , it 's a different story			2
the space collaboration between the two nations has survived other diplomatic kerfuffles			0
and there 's no need to worry , @entity10 says			2
" we do not expect the current @entity3 - @entity4 situation to have any impact on our civil space cooperation with @entity3 , including our partnership on the @entity20 program , " said @entity13 , a @entity10 spokesman			1
" it is in the best interest of all @entity20 partners not to allow disruption of operations that have maintained continuous human presence on orbit for over a decade			2
" right now , @entity0 astronaut @entity28 is aboard the @entity29 with two @entity3 cosmonauts			1
he returns home aboard a @entity3 capsule on monday			2
a few weeks later , another @entity0 astronaut , @entity33 , joins another two @entity3 on a trip to the station aboard another @entity3 soyuz craft			1
@entity37 vs. @entity38 : facing off over facts in @entity4 ' reluctant co-dependency ' the two nations ca n't afford temporary tussles to upend a costly relationship -- one that @entity44 , a former space engineer , describes as " reluctant co-dependency			0
" @entity10 retired its space shuttle fleet in 2011 , and its astronauts have no way to get to and from the station			1
@entity3 @entity50 capsules ferry @entity0 astronauts and cosmonauts , together with supplies that can fit in the smaller craft			1
in turn , the @entity0 brings to the table technology far more advanced than @entity3 's capabilities , @entity44 told @entity58			2
at the same time , many of the @entity3 systems are more reliable because they are simpler and have been operating longer , @entity59 , former @entity10 astronaut and @entity20 commander , told @entity63			1
the space station itself has an intricate blend of both countries ' contributions -- from @entity0 solar arrays and power systems to @entity3 core life support systems , to a navigation system that comes from both countries , he said			1
@entity0 and @entity3 train on each other 's systems , but one country ca n't run the station alone , he said			1
the mission control centers in @entity79 and @entity80 , near @entity81 , have to coordinate commands sent to the station , he said			0
" we need each other to operate the station , " @entity59 said			0
" otherwise we run the risk of losing that asset			0
" past disagreements @entity3 and the @entity0 have disagreed on various issues in the past -- including most recently , the war in @entity92 , and @entity81 's granting of temporary asylum to @entity96 leaker @entity95			2
the extraterrestrial partnership has gone unscathed			0
" @entity10 and its @entity3 counterpart , @entity99 , have maintained a professional , beneficial and collegial working relationship through the various ups and downs of the broader @entity0 - @entity3 relationship and we expect that to continue , " @entity13 said			1
going about their days up in space , the crew members for @entity108 are going about their regular days			0
when they 're not busy conducting experiments , they play with floating food , exercise and document the spinning @entity1 with scenic pictures of various continents			0
" checked out our @entity116 suits today in preparation for returning to @entity1 next monday , " @entity28 tweeted this week			0
" ca n't believe it 's almost time ! " @entity28 ' crew includes @entity3 @entity121 and @entity122 , the latter a native of @entity125			2
the trio 's research focuses on human health and documenting protein crystal growth , which will help researchers come up with new treatment for diseases such as cystic fibrosis			0
the three launched in september , and are also studying the effects of extended space travel as @entity10 and @entity99 prepare to send two crew members aboard the space station for a year			1
but it 's not all work and no play at the working laboratory orbiting about 240 miles above @entity1			0
the crew also gets a chance to gaze at breathtaking sunsets and sunrises that occur every 45 minutes			0
on their regular weekends off , the international scientists watch movies , play music and cards , and talk to their families			0
a pretty penny the agreement between the two nations costs a pretty penny			0
according to a new deal @entity10 signed with the @entity99 , the @entity0 will pay @entity3 $ 71 million to ferry each astronaut to the space station			1
the emergence of private companies into the space transport business may change the game			0
@entity10 has a $ 1.6 billion contract with @entity164 to fly at least 12 cargo resupply missions to the space station , and a $ 1.9 billion contract with @entity168 for eight such missions			1
@entity164 is gearing up for its third commercial resupply mission this month ; @entity168 completed its first in february			0
as for transporting astronauts , @entity10 said in november that it is seeking to partner with @entity0 companies for human trips to the station as well , by 2017			1
that could end @entity0 reliance on @entity3 for space voyages			1
but for now , experts say the @entity0 - @entity3 relationship on space remains a marriage of convenience .			2
