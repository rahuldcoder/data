after several months of airstrikes , the international coalition 's operation against @entity2 in @entity3 has failed to dismantle the group 's structure of command and has pushed its militants further beyond the country 's borders			1
civilians and opposition rebel forces have been left frustrated by the coalition 's narrow focus , lack of a clear agenda and apparent failure to take into consideration the dynamics of the wider @entity3 conflict			1
late last month , @entity3 foreign minister @entity21 said that without @entity25 approval , the @entity23 strikes lacked legitimacy			1
but in comments to media he said : " anyway , if their aim is to strike against @entity2 , it 's ok			2
" does this statement mean that the @entity3 government views the coalition strikes as beneficial to its hold on power ? does the old @entity38 proverb the " enemy of my enemy is my friend " apply to this case and to the reality on the ground ? in the short term , the international coalition 's counter-terrorism strategy may certainly be in the interests of the @entity50 regime			1
military strikes are to some extent forcing @entity2 fighters to retreat from territories under their control in northern and eastern @entity3			1
other opposition groups -- including the @entity57 -- are unlikely to have the capability to take advantage of these strikes			0
the @entity3 military is still superior when it comes to aerial force and may be best placed to retake @entity2 territories			1
although the @entity67 would like to see an @entity69 offensive that would ultimately lead to the collapse of the @entity3 government , the @entity23 and @entity66 allies have made it clear that regime change is not an objective of this military campaign			0
coalition strikes have not been targeting the @entity3 government 's military forces or infrastructure			1
thus the @entity3 government has found the @entity23 , @entity66 allies , and @entity38 states on the side of its own allies @entity84 and the @entity85 -- aiding @entity50 against one of his most powerful and influential threats			1
ironically , the same nations that may have indirectly contributed to the creation of @entity2 itself , are now investing their military capital into fighting it			0
so far , however , the balance of power has not shifted significantly either in favor of the government forces or rebel groups			0
@entity2 has been pushed out of some territories , but is advancing in others			0
although government forces have made slight advances in @entity101 , resource constraints have prevented the military from taking full advantage of the coalition strikes			2
strategically , @entity50 needs to focus on holding the large cities already under government control			0
civilian suffering more fundamentally , the coalition 's @entity69 campaign has deflected attention from the @entity3 government and armed rebel group 's atrocities against civilians			2
there are claims the @entity50 government has in fact ratcheted up its attacks in the shadow of the strikes			0
the opposition @entity121 on thursday reported that regime airstrikes had killed 221 civilians , " taking advantage of the international media focusing on @entity2 and @entity126 '			2
" @entity3 civilians might also question why the international community decided to intervene against @entity2 after ignoring -- for several years -- the @entity3 government 's brutality in a conflict that has led to more than 190,000 deaths and more than 3,200,000 refugees			1
the offensive has not alleviated the humanitarian crisis facing the @entity3 people and the strikes ' unintended consequences -- civilian casualties -- are increasingly leading to a domestic outcry against such intervention			0
tackling the disease for some , the question is why the coalition does not address the fundamental roots of the war , tackling the disease itself rather than the symptoms			0
on a long term basis , the coalition strikes against @entity2 in @entity3 will inevitably keep expanding , working to escalate the conflict			1
a strategic shift to target the @entity3 government 's military infrastructure is unlikely as many regional and international state actors have a stake in @entity3			0
coalition training may gradually improve some of the @entity3 rebel groups ' military capabilities and strategic planning but the current balance of power between the government forces and various rebel and armed groups will likely continue			2
domestic , regional , international and non-state players will continue to pursue their own goals			0
amid ongoing instability and competing interests , @entity3 's social and political environment will be ripe for further radicalization , militarization and ultimately further civilian suffering			0
in the end , both @entity2 and @entity50 may be the beneficiaries of the foreign airstrikes , using them as a pretext to further advance their political interests			2
a narrow and short - term counter-terrorism strategy that fails to take into account the many layers of the wider @entity3 conflict is unlikely to succeed .			1

@entity3 has said coalition strikes lack legitimacy but aim of striking @entity2 is ok
@entity189 says in the short term , coalition strikes may help the @entity50 regime
but he says the coalition strategy fails to take the wider conflict into account
the conflict will continue to escalate and @entity3 civilians will suffer , he says
