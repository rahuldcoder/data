-- if you 're walking along the east @entity3 coast and chance upon a herd of brightly - striped elephants , flame - hued rhinos and a tower of crazily - colored giraffes , then do n't panic , you 're not hallucinating -- and neither have you stumbled on a psychedelic new species , sorry			2
no , in fact this is the vibrant kingdom of skilful artisans where harmful waste is transformed into a colorful bliss -- one flip - flop at a time			1
@entity19 is a @entity20 recycling company that 's crafting whimsical pieces of art and fashion from discarded flip - flops and other plastic junk -- piles of rubbish that wash up on @entity20 's sandy beaches			1
read this : old boat sails turned into uplifting art inside its @entity33 - based workshop , reclaimed old sandals and other polluting pieces of rubber are fashioned into handmade animal toys , eye - popping curtains , intricate necklaces and even life - size sculptures			1
the playful creations are sold locally as well as in dozens of zoos , aquariums and stores in some 20 countries across the wold			1
" it 's a trade - based solution to the global problem of marine pollution , " says @entity47 , the co-founder of @entity19			1
" it gets people to think about the ocean and links them to waterways -- and we 're doing it through business			2
" environmental threat like in many other developing countries , flip - flops are the footwear of choice for millions of people in @entity20			1
affordable and convenient , they are worn by both children and adults alike , as well as by scores of tourists visiting the white sand beaches in east @entity3			0
but once the sandals ' walking life comes to an end , the ubiquitous footwear often embarks on another , more harmful , journey			0
masses of broken rubber flip - flops dumped in cities and villages are carried by sewage systems , rivers and other waterways into @entity20 coastlines every year			1
at the same time , countless of non-degradable flip - flops and other plastic waste ends up on the same shores , brought there by powerful currents from places as far away as @entity90 and @entity91			1

" pollution in all our waterways is a big problem , " says @entity47 , who was born and raised in @entity20			2
" rivers are clogged up with plastic and rubber and everything else , " she adds			0
" when people say that the ocean is plastic soup , it really is , because plastic does n't go away -- it just breaks down to smaller and smaller parts			0
fish , whales , sharks are digesting that plastic and sooner or later that 's going to work its way into our food chain			0
" @entity123 , not aid the inspiration for @entity19 came in 1997 when @entity126 , a marine conservationist at the time , started working in a sea turtle preservation project on the remote island of @entity131 near the @entity20 - @entity133 border			1
whilst there , @entity126 was shocked to find beautiful beaches strewn with a myriad of plastic objects that damaged the environment and obstructed the turtles from reaching their nesting sites			0
but , with curious fascination , @entity126 also watched how local children used this marine debris -- cast - off flip - flops and other junk they 'd found by the sea -- to create their own toys to play with			1
this triggered a thought on @entity126 's mind : what if she could launch a project that would help clean the beaches and also boost development in the community ? inspired by the children 's makeshift creations , @entity126 then encouraged the local women to collect , wash and process the thrown - away flip - flops and transform them into colorful artefacts for a profit			1
" we started a minor little program there , " recalls @entity126 , " with that sort of idea to link conservation and development together			0
" transforming rubber , changing attitudes what began as a part time initiative -- which was initially dubbed @entity174 -- has now been turned into a regular and growing business			0
@entity19 , which provides direct employment today to more than 70 people , aims to recycle 400,000 flip - flops every year			1
it works with more than 10 suppliers who collect the raw material from waterways in and around @entity33 , as well as from the @entity20 coastline , and deliver it to the company 's workshop			2
read this : fishing craft to foosball tables , furniture to float your boat there , @entity19 workers go through large bags full of broken flip - flops every day to select the ones they 're going to use in their creations			1
the artisans then clean the rubber sandals and sort them according to their color			2
next , they cut , mold and sand them as they turn the old flip - flops into their eye - catching creations			1
" we are focused mainly on animals , " says @entity47			0
" our target markets are zoos , aquariums and museums worldwide -- we 've done that because that 's what we 're good at making at the moment but we are exploring other products too			2
" @entity126 says that @entity19 is for her " a means to an end , " a more effective way to spread her green message than working as a marine conservationist			2
" my goal is to create change in the way people live and change in the way people understand the world and its connections , " she says			0
" certainly about the ocean , doing that through the business of recycling rubber that floats , " she continues , " and doing it independently in a relative sustainable and grown up way where you have to have a market and a good product , you 've got to be commercial , " adds @entity126			0
" i think only if we succeeded commercially we can really succeed in our goal which is to create attitudinal and lifestyle change			0
