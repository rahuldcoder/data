@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 is a woman in a hurry			2
she 's late for a meeting with @entity9 's people , the batteries on her cell phone are running out , and besides , @entity12 call roaming charges are " horrendous			2
" @entity3 : " we simply can not afford to be timid on climate change			1
" i 've managed to get her on the phone from @entity17 , one of the three cities that serve as a base for the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) , the organization she founded in 2000			0
by @entity3 's own admission , she is " in perpetual motion , regularly traveling between my offices and homes in @entity27 , @entity17 and @entity1			2
" @entity3 's not only on a tight timetable today -- the way she sees it she has just two years to change the @entity33 government 's position on climate change			1
" 2008 and 2009 are very , very important years for us			0
these are the years before we reach a global deal			0
" the timetable for a global pact was agreed at the @entity41 climate talks in @entity42 last december			0
the deal will replace the @entity45 agreement which runs out in 2012			0
after principal voices principal voices last heard from @entity3 in 2006 when she took part in the @entity50 panel at the @entity51 in @entity1			1
at the time , she stressed the need for individuals to make changes , however small , to contribute to the global effort to reverse climate change			1
in two years she says a lot has changed			0
" for the first time people are talking about climate change in a much most focused way			1
" " consumers have become better informed and more demanding			0
but in a marketplace that 's buzzing with information overload they 've also become more confused			0
" " it 's often not easy to know what the ' right thing ' to do is , " she says			0
" that 's why we need a greater emphasis on ' personal responsibility ' not just ' corporate responsibility ' which can leave us having greater expectations of others than of ourselves			0
" the challenge @entity3 has appointed herself chief antagonist to the @entity33 government on climate change			1
environmentalists within @entity33 and around the world are urging the government to do more to reduce the country 's carbon emissions			1
in late march , @entity85 warned that 50 million people from @entity33 , and another 75 million from @entity87 , could be displaced if global warming was allowed to rise above the two degree tipping point , the point when it becomes too late to act			2
@entity85 campaign director @entity92 says , " the @entity33 government has wrongly forsaken mitigation for adaptation and the forthcoming session of @entity97 must debate this wisdom which has serious long term consequences			2
" @entity33 's view is that the developed world has a long history of producing carbon emissions and that its recent economic development should not be unduly restrained by having to meet restrictive global targets			1
in an address to the @entity108 , prime minister @entity109 said , " we can not continue with a global development model in which some countries continue to maintain high carbon emissions , while the development options available for developing countries get constrained			0
" read full address here he 's offered to limit @entity33 's per capita carbon emissions to the average carbon emission of developed industrial countries			2
with a population of more than one billion people , a per capita target would give @entity33 more room to maneuver			2
changing attitudes @entity3 will be among the activists poring over the @entity33 government 's @entity126 when it 's released in june			1
she 's hoping there 'll be a shift in the government 's attitude and thinks that pressure from the public could be enough to prompt a rethink			0
" our job is to give voice to that public challenge and re-frame the debate from a victim - led ' ca n't do - wo n't do ' mentality to a ' can do - must do ' debate based on hope and good propositions , " she says			0
" one in every six people on the planet is @entity33 and tomorrow 's world is @entity33			1
