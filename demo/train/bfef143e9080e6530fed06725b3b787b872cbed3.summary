@entity0 , @entity1 -- puzzled zookeepers in northern @entity1 have discovered the reason why their attempts to mate two polar bears kept failing : both are female			1
a 4 - year - old polar bear sent to impregnate a female polar bear at a zoo in @entity11 was found to be female as well			1
the municipal zoo in the city of @entity11 in @entity14 brought in a polar bear cub three years ago			1
they named it @entity18 , after the popular baseball outfielder @entity19 , and waited until it reached reproductive age			2
in june , the zoo introduced @entity18 to its resident bear , an 11 - year - old female named @entity25 , and waited for sparks to fly			1
but much to the disappointment of zookeepers , @entity18 never made any amorous advances toward @entity30			1
earlier this month , zookeepers put @entity18 under anesthesia to get to the bottom of the matter			0
that 's when they made their discovery : @entity18 is a female			1
still , the @entity11 zoo plans to keep @entity18 because he -- or rather , she -- has become immensely popular with visitors			2
" i have rather mixed feelings , given the need for breeding , but @entity18 is an idol for @entity11 , " @entity40 , head of the @entity11 zoo , told @entity1 's @entity42 news agency			0
@entity18 will even keep her name			0
" we will not be changing it to ' @entity50 ' since it is loved by citizens ( by the current name ) , " @entity40 said			0
" @entity55 " is a common suffix for a @entity1 female name			0
meanwhile , @entity18 's " brother , " who was adopted by another zoo , has also turned out to be female , @entity42 reported			2
-- @entity2 's @entity59 contributed to this report			0

@entity62 introduced polar bear cub to its resident bear and waited for sparks to fly
and it waited and waited : @entity18 never made amorous advances toward @entity30
months later , the zoo makes key discovery : both bears are female
