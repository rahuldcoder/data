@entity0 -- about 250 veterans gathered today at the @entity3 in @entity0			1
they were joined by @entity4 and @entity5 to mark the premiere of their 10 - part @entity8 series , " @entity9			1
" it was a high - profile public media event , but for me it was personal			1
for me , it brought back memories of my dad , who fought the @entity17 in @entity18			1
when i was 9 or 10 years old , my father took me to a college basketball game			1
as the clock ran out , a trumpeter in the pep band thought it would be cute to mark the demise of the rival team by playing taps			2
" shut up ! " he roared			2
the trumpeter played on , oblivious			2
@entity28 got to his feet , fists clenched			2
" i said , ' shut up ! ' " embarrassed , i cringed in my seat			2
i 'd never seen @entity28 this upset			2
but most people in the noisy auditorium were unaware of his wrath			2
he was drowned out by cheers , and by amused laughter at the cleverness of the trumpeter			2
later , @entity28 explained to me that his strong emotions went back nearly 15 years when he was an officer on gen. @entity44 's staff during the @entity46 's assault on @entity47			1
under the leadership of maj. gen. @entity49 , the " @entity53 " fought through @entity50 , @entity51 , and into @entity47 , seeing unbelievable carnage			1
some men became numb to it			2
@entity28 told me about seeing a couple of soldiers carelessly tossing bodies into the back of a truck to be hauled away from the battlefield			1
as @entity28 watched , a passing officer angrily chewed out the men : " these are soldiers of the @entity63 , " the officer yelled , " and they will be treated with respect ! " whenever @entity28 told that story , his voice would catch			1
@entity69 -- 50 years after the @entity17 surrendered and some 35 years after that basketball game			2
his emotions were still raw as we sat together on the back porch of my home in suburban @entity77			2
over the course of three days , i held a small tape recorder between us as he talked about his life			1
not surprisingly , his days in combat with the 104th took up most of the eight hours i captured on tape			0
@entity28 was a shy man , placid , slow to anger			1
rarely did he show much emotion of any kind , except laughter -- he loved to laugh			0
so , it was unexpected when , during a taping session , he suddenly broke down and wept			0
he 'd been describing the day he came across a group of @entity93 infantrymen who 'd been caught in a crossfire and slaughtered			0
" if it had n't been for those guys in the infantry , " he said , swiping at his tears , " i never would have survived the war			1
" my dad , n. @entity100 , remained in the @entity102 after @entity103 , retiring as a colonel in 1960			1
he practiced law in @entity106 , @entity107 , and died may 29 , 1996 , at the age of 88			0
i went in his place to the 56th @entity53 reunion in @entity77 august 28 to september 3 , 2001			1
( the unit 's final reunion will be september 1 in @entity113			1
) at the @entity77 reunion , i had a chance to relay @entity28 's appreciation of the infantry to several of the veterans i met -- and i listened as many of them talked about their experiences			1
the memories were old , but the tears were fresh			0
one told me , " think of the worst you could go through -- then double it			0
" another said he wrote down his story but hid the manuscript in a safe deposit box for his children to read after his death			0
" it 's too awful to talk about , " he explained , " plus , none of them seem very interested in what i did during the war			1
" one infantryman recounted the shock and horror of finding the bodies of some of his closest foxhole buddies " dead in the street			0
" " i just shut down completely , " he said			0
" my emotions turned to ice			0
suddenly , i had no one i could talk to			0
" " could you pray ? " i asked			0
" i could until [ the ] @entity152 [ concentration camp ] , " he replied			0
( on april 11 , 1945 , the 104th liberated the @entity155 camp in @entity152 , @entity47			0
the bodies of 5,000 starved prisoners were stacked like cordwood and the few hundred survivors were like walking skeletons			0
) he told me it took years , and the help of several understanding people , to restore in him a semblance of faith			0
" how did the war change you ? " i asked several of the men			1
" it made me mean , " one man confessed			1
some said it took years , and the patience of long - suffering spouses , before they were able to overcome their anger -- anger they did n't even know they had until others pointed it out to them			0
during my time with these men , i tried to resist my journalistic instinct to probe			0
it was a rich experience			0
an experience , i fear , that will be lost forever if more of us do n't encourage these men and women to tell their stories for history			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193			1

vets in @entity0 today for *kickoff* of @entity8 series " @entity9 " made @entity193 think of his dad
his father saw carnage during @entity103 stint as an officer serving in @entity18 , he says
as @entity100 taped his father 's war *recollections* , his normally placid dad became emotional
at a reunion @entity100 talked with his dad 's *fellow* soldiers about how the war changed them
