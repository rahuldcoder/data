-- the epiphany occurred at a baptism			0
with more than 800 people waiting , pastor @entity3 took them one by one and immersed them in the church 's baptism pool			1
during this spiritual rite at @entity10 , the pastors hold the people briefly underwater , and then pull them out			0
" on that particular day , i was baptizing 858 people , " @entity3 told his congregation last fall			1
" that took me literally four hours			0
" " as i 'm baptizing 858 people , along around 500 , i thought this ... ' we 're all fat			0
' " @entity3 turned his realization to himself			1
" but i thought , i 'm fat , " he said			0
" i 'm a terrible model of this			0
i ca n't expect our people to get in shape unless i do			0
" @entity3 , considered one of the most influential pastors in the country , delivered the inaugural prayer for president @entity28 in 2009 and wrote the best - selling book " @entity30			1
" now , he was embarking on a new mission : curbing the obesity epidemic at church			2
@entity3 seems like an unlikely man to lead an anti-obesity crusade			1
a ruddy man with plastic frame glasses , he has admitted to gaining 90 pounds over the last 30 years and failing at various yo - yo diets			2
he declined an interview for this story			0
based in @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity10 is one of the largest churches in the @entity44 and has eight locations throughout @entity46			0

since january 2011 , @entity3 has been shrinking			1
he gave up carbonated drinks , dairy and fast food , he told the church			2
he works out twice a day , according to his trainer , @entity54			0
@entity3 shed 60 pounds on a diet - lifestyle program devised at @entity10 called the @entity56			1
the program 's name comes from the biblical story about @entity56			1
in the story , @entity56 and his friends , who are israelites living in @entity62 , refuse to consume royal food and wine			1
by eating vegetables and water , " they looked healthier and better nourished than any of the young men who ate the royal food , " according to @entity56 in the @entity71 's @entity70			1
the @entity72 , which started at @entity10 last january , advises how to eat healthier foods , encourages workout routines and urges participants to join small groups			1
@entity3 recruited three doctors to develop the plan : @entity80 , a psychiatrist ; @entity81 , a family doctor ; and @entity83 , a tv host and cardiac surgeon			1
" the secret sauce of @entity10 is we do this as a community , " said @entity80 , one of the medical contributors			0
" it 's very different than most health plans where you do it with yourself or your wife			2
you get to do this with a whole community			0
" studies indicate that people who try to lose weight or adopt healthier habits in groups are more likely to be successful than individuals working independently			1
the small groups have health and spiritual curricula , and provide a support network			1
@entity10 was the ideal place , because small groups already existed at the church and @entity3 had " instantaneous capacity to make this happen , " said @entity81 , another contributor to the @entity56			1
" the church was the perfect incubator , " he said			2
" this was a way of leapfrogging and getting a social experiment done			0
" @entity118 , a member of @entity10 , said that having a small group was instrumental to her 125 - pound weight loss			2
her group met twice a month to discuss their health , and they also hiked together			2
each small group has a health champion , whom seals credits with " helping me emotionally , physically			1
" " the health champion guides the group -- ' this is what we 're cooking , this is what we 're doing ' -- and cheers you on and helps you out			2
it 's not just the food you 're eating , it 's also mental gain , " she said			0
the church held a race , cooking demonstrations and various workout classes led by @entity143 founder @entity142			2
it overhauled the menus and vending machine products sold at church and placed symbols to indicate which choices were healthy			2
doughnuts often given to the congregation were replaced with trail mix. the church developed a website with recipes , advice on physical activity and health information			1
" it 's not a diet , not a healthy quick scheme , it 's designed to be a way to create health , " @entity81 said			1
at the end of the first year , about 15,000 people had registered for the program and 250,000 pounds were lost , according to @entity10			1
the @entity56 is a program the founders intended to spread to different faith communities across the globe , @entity81 said			1
but many at @entity10 wondered why the church would get involved in health and weight loss			1
" i wondered whether this was something church should be doing , " said @entity175 , a member of @entity10 for 18 years			2
@entity175 and her husband decided to try the plan , because they had gained weight during his illness with multiple sclerosis			0
between his doctor 's visits , hospital appointments and busy schedule , the family came to rely on fast food as their staple			0
the couple and their two kids , ages 10 and 16 , cleaned out their pantry , gave up the @entity199 burgers and started cooking as a family activity			0
they started eating chicken , broccoli , squash and a variety of vegetables , and in smaller portions			0
they bought a trampoline for the kids and also started hiking			0
one year later , @entity175 has lost 28 pounds			2
her husband has lost 55 pounds and stopped taking as many medications			0
" this is what we should be doing , " @entity175 said about the church 's involvement in the health plan			1
" i am far more able to serve @entity219 because i 'm healthy			0
" @entity3 said in several speeches to the congregation that he never paid much attention to the perils of obesity such as diabetes and heart disease			2
but when he heard that obesity could affect a person 's brain power , it snapped him into action			0
growing evidence indicates that obesity is associated with impaired cognitive function , such as attention and memory problems			0
@entity3 often repeats the same phrases when discussing the @entity56			1
" the @entity239 made your body , @entity242 paid for your body , the spirit lives in your body			0
you better take care of it			0
