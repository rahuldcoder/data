-- @entity1 says it 's naive to think tennis does n't have drug cheats			1
but @entity5 , who has played at the year - end championships the previous two seasons , is of the belief that his fellow professionals are n't doping -- or at least not on a widespread basis			1
@entity1 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 -- the sport 's most influential players who have combined won more than 30 grand slam titles -- have all called for either more tests or stricter controls , and last month the @entity19 duly announced that it was adopting the biological passport program			1
" i live in the belief that we are playing a clean sport , " world no. 10 @entity5 told @entity0 's @entity22			1
" if there is doping involved , maybe there is , maybe there is n't			0
but i can guarantee you that the people i 'm hanging around with , none of them ( are ) doping			0
" in the new initiative a player 's blood profile can be tracked , similar to cycling , a sport still reeling from @entity40 's admission that he used performance enhancing drugs			0
significant changes can alert authorities to a potential doping infraction and more blood tests will also be carried out			2
according to @entity19 statistics , @entity5 was among the minority of players who had to provide samples both in competition and outside of it in 2012			1
the number of samples he provided in competition , in the highest category listed as seven or more , put him in the minority , too			1
the figures did n't include tests carried out by national doping agencies and at the @entity61 and @entity62			2
as a top - 50 player , @entity5 must adhere to the so - called whereabouts rule by making himself available to be tested in an one - hour slot for an out - of - competition test if the drug testers randomly come calling			1
the rule has often given players headaches , with @entity69 , the women 's world no. 1 , telling reporters in @entity72 in february that testers had once paid her a visit in @entity75			0
" i like things as they are because the international doping agency needs to know every single day of my life where i am and if i 'm changing locations , " @entity5 said			2
" we need to fill out this form to say today we 're going to be there and at any time they can come and test us			0
on top of that you have the local drug testing			0
" you have the tournament testing when you play tournaments ... i do n't want to take it too far			0
" in february , @entity13 called for more blood testing , saying that tennis needed to do everything it could " to ensure that everyone competing at the highest level and below is clean			0
" while just under 2,000 urine samples were collected in 2012 , less than 200 blood tests were conducted .			2

@entity5 is *adamant* that none of the players he hangs around with are drug cheats
a biological passport program was *launched* after players called for more tests
@entity5 was among a minority of players tested both in and out of competition in 2012
