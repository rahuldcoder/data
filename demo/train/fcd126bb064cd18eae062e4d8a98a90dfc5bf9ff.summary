-- @entity1 learned an important lesson this week : not everyone likes @entity4			1
and even those who do really do n't like it when you put music in their libraries without asking			0
a week after giving away a @entity4 album to most @entity13 users , @entity1 has announced a way for customers to get rid of it			1
the company released instructions on how to delete the album from an @entity20 account , complete with a giant " @entity22 " button			1
somewhere , a single tear is rolling down @entity25 's cheek			0
at the end of @entity1 's @entity29 and @entity30 announcement last week , the company trotted out the rock supergroup to announce a major marketing collaboration			2
is the @entity30 a game changer ? @entity1 was giving away @entity4 's first new album in five years , " @entity36 , " to 500 million @entity13 customers for free			1
it was a clever way to get more people to sign up for @entity13 , and @entity1 even produced a special ad to promote the collaboration			2
unfortunately , instead of just offering customers the option to download the album for free , @entity1 went ahead and gave it to them without asking			1
the album was dropped into the 500 million active @entity20 accounts in 119 countries			0
the people who have their @entity13 account set up to automatically download any purchases saw the files on their computers and mobile devices			2
many complained that the way the album was distributed was invasive			0
it also came off as tone - deaf , since it happened so soon after @entity20 's security was scrutinized for its part in high - profile celebrity photo hacks			0
@entity1 spent up to $ 100 million on the @entity4 marketing campaign , according to the @entity62 .			0

@entity1 has *posted* instructions for deleting the free @entity4 album from an @entity20 account
the company gave @entity13 customers the album for free last week
many people were *unhappy* that the files were added to their accounts without *permission*
