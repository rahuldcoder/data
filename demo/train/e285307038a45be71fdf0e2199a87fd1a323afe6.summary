@entity0 vividly remembers the day in 1998 when he left a @entity2 @entity1 loan office in @entity4 empty - handed			1
he had applied for a low - interest @entity1 loan to help keep a farm in family ownership			1
he says he expected his application to be accepted			2
he had kept his debt at a minimum and developed a plan for supplementing his income			2
he believes he was turned down because he 's @entity13 , a member of the @entity16 tribe			1
" the day i walked out of there , i knew why he denied me , " @entity0 said			2
in 1999 , he joined other @entity19 in a class - action lawsuit that accused the @entity1 of discriminatory lending over a 25 - year period			1
@entity1 loans can be used for purchasing land , livestock , equipment and other operational items			1
the lending practices of @entity1 regional offices have cost @entity13 farmers hundreds of millions of dollars in potential revenue , their lawyers said , although they added that it 's a hard number to estimate because of how many farmers may have been affected			1
the attorneys say their expert witness , agricultural economist @entity36 , estimated that over 18 years , @entity13 farmers received only half the loans they could have expected to obtain			1
as a result , many saw their farms foreclosed on and their fields lying fallow			2
a recent settlement on behalf of @entity45 farmers gave @entity19 hope that their case will also be resolved in their favor			1
individual black farmers could receive $ 50,000 each as a result of the case , known as @entity51 according to the 2007 @entity53 , there are about 60,000 @entity13 farmers in the @entity2 -- double the number of @entity45 farmers			1
the vast majority of @entity13 farmers work on family - operated farms			1
@entity0 lives on 320 gently rolling acres in @entity4 , where he raises cattle			0
his primary source of income is work as a blacksmith , shoeing horses in his community			0
with the right amount of financial help , he said , his life could have been different			0
" i could have been a rancher , " he said			0
" that 's what i wanted to do			0
" @entity0 said regional @entity1 offices repeatedly denied him access to loans			1
in one instance , he said he was told to " go see [ his ] tribe			0
" after the regional office denied him a loan at 4 percent interest , @entity0 said he received an 8 percent interest loan through a private bank			2
he purchased the acres he lives on now , but he said the high interest has put a strain on his finances			2
" if it was fair , i would be in a different place , " he said			0
" i am thankful to be where i am , do n't get me wrong , but i would be in a different place			0
" the @entity19 ' lead counsel , @entity90 , said the @entity1 loans are vital to the existence of @entity13 farmers			1
" the precondition to getting these kinds of loans is the @entity1 is regarded as the lender of last resort , " he said			1
" so the people who get these loans have already demonstrated that they ca n't get loans at two commercial lending institutions			2
so if they do n't get credit from the @entity1 , they get credit from no one			1
" @entity36 , formerly with the @entity1 research service , agreed , saying that @entity1 loan programs were " limited to operators who can not obtain sufficient credit at reasonable rates elsewhere but who would be able to operate viable farm businesses if @entity1 made the loan ( s ) in question			1
" @entity116 says farming is in her blood			0
her family was named its county 's @entity120 in 1968			0
she says credit became almost impossible to get around the time she married her husband , @entity125 , in 1979			0
like @entity0 , she is @entity13 and said she remembers when the loan practices of her local @entity1 office took what she called " an aggressive stance			1
" @entity116 , who was a borrower from the @entity1 for years , is now a plaintiff in the lawsuit against it			1
" it became apparent we were receiving different treatment , " she said			0
" we were given loan amounts that were lesser than we already requested , and we were encouraged to buy the oldest machinery instead of stuff adequate and [ the ] equivalent to white farmers			1
we started to receive a lot of resistance from the local county staff			0
" @entity116 said the regional office 's stance toward lending was aimed not only at putting @entity13 farmers at a disadvantage , but at benefiting their non-native @entity45 counterparts			1
many @entity13 farms are on land -- usually in reservations -- that the federal government holds in trusts for the benefit of future generations			1
the land falls under tribal government authority , but @entity116 charged that as more @entity13 farms defaulted on loans from the government , more farms were offered by the federal government for purchase to farmers who were not @entity19			1
a 1997 report from a civil rights action team to the @entity1 on the treatment of minority farmers generally , cited in the lawsuit , said that as minority farmers were unable to afford their lands , " the land is lost finally and sold at auction , where it is bought by someone else at half the price being asked of the minority farmer			1
often it is alleged that the person was a friend or relative of one of [ the @entity1 's @entity181 ] county officials			1
" the @entity182 are members of the @entity182 , @entity184 and @entity185 , also known as @entity186			0
the couple still resides on land that was allocated by the @entity189 , which aimed at settling native american tribes and turning them into farmers and ranchers			2
@entity116 , who now works as a @entity13 credit outreach counselor , said she and her family struggled without access to affordable credit			2
after she failed to secure a @entity1 loan , the @entity182 raised four children in a two - bedroom mobile home for 12 years			1
without proper loans , she said , she could n't afford a larger home			2
it was n't until 2007 that she moved her family into what she felt was adequate housing , purchased through a local housing authority			0
ultimately , @entity116 said , they wo n't be able to hand down working farms to their children			0
" we are n't able to pass on farms with buildings and irrigation			0
a lot of us just have the bare land with fences			0
many of us do n't even have buildings , " she said			0
" many of us just finally achieved standard housing			0
for this to be happening in the @entity2 today , with an agency that was supposed to fund us equally , is just wrong			0
" agriculture secretary @entity222 said in a recent statement to @entity224 that the @entity1 is " committed to resolving allegations of past discrimination because we are intent on ensuring every farmer and rancher is treated equally and fairly			1
we have made significant progress on addressing @entity1 's civil rights record to close this chapter in the department 's history			2
" @entity1 officials told @entity224 that they are in settlement discussions with @entity13 farmers and that they are putting the final touches on a plan that would turn the page on the discrimination claims by @entity242 and women farmers , as well			1
" we want to put this behind us and focus on the future , " a @entity1 official said			1
" we want to make sure we have a strong foundation moving forward			0
" farmers such as @entity248 , for whom the case is named , have seen the years pass since the lawsuit was filed			2
in the 12 years that he and his wife , @entity252 , have been plaintiffs in the case , his health has deteriorated significantly because of stress , he said			0
@entity248 , who is 70 , was forced to sell his farm years ago			0
the couple now lives on the @entity257 in @entity258 and said they want to change the way the @entity1 services loans to minority communities			1
they said they are optimistic , but @entity252 admits that @entity248 has misgivings			0
" he worries a lot			0
he worries more than i do , " she said			0
" i support him , i encourage him , i tell him it 's not the @entity269 and something good should come out of this			0
" for @entity0 , the lawsuit is n't about the money ; it 's about the future for his four young daughters			2
" i hope to see fairness in @entity4 , " he said			2
" i hope to see that it does n't matter , the color of your skin , or nationality , if you 're trying to make a productive living			2
this goes back to 1700 ; some things just do n't change -- it 's time			0
