-- on wednesday , @entity1 announced a pretty mind - boggling stat : the 25 billionth song had been downloaded on @entity5			1
with a b. since launching the @entity8 in 2001 , and @entity5 in 2003 , @entity1 has been a leader in digital music , virtually defining the space for competitors like @entity13 and @entity14			1
here are five interesting facts about the milestone : 1			0
who did it ? @entity19 of @entity20 was the lucky downloader			0
for happening to click at the right nanosecond , he 'll be getting a 10,000 - @entity24 ( $ 13,528 ) @entity5 gift card			2
and it was no easy task			0
according to @entity1 , users download an average of 15,000 songs every minute			2
what was the tune ? you 've probably never heard of it			0
we had n't heard of it either			0
" @entity38 ( @entity39 ) " was the jam in question			1
it 's by @entity41 , a @entity42 dj and producer who 's well known in the house - music scene			1
it 's not so big on lyrics			0
which is to say , it does n't have any			0
and it probably comes across better when you 're shaking it in a crowd of sweaty club kids than , say , sipping coffee and doing the @entity56 crossword			0
other @entity5 milestones 25 millionth song -- " @entity59 ! let it snow ! " @entity61 , 2003 100 millionth -- " somersault ( @entity64 remix ) , " by @entity66 electronica band @entity65 , 2004 500 millionth -- " @entity67 , " @entity68 , 2005 1 billionth -- " @entity69 , " @entity70 , 2006 10 billionth -- " @entity72 , " @entity71 , 2010 @entity73 , from @entity74 , @entity75 , was the luckiest of downloaders			1
for the billionth download , he scored a 20 - inch @entity79 , 10 fifth - generation ipods and a $ 10,000 gift card , not to mention a scholarship set up by @entity1 at the @entity83 in his name			2
25 billion is a lot obvious , right ? but how much is it ? well , it 's roughly equal to three - and - a - half songs for every person on @entity90			1
by way of comparison , the @entity91 lists " @entity97 " as the top - selling song of all time at around 100 million copies			0
multiply that by 250 and you get 25 billion			1
@entity103 's " @entity102 " is the no. 1 selling album of all time with more than 42 million certified sales			0
it would need to do that again almost 600 times to hit 25 billion			1
for a little more tech industry - specific comparison , @entity14 's @entity107 hit 25 billion downloads in september for mobile apps running on its android operating system			1
more @entity5 by the numbers more than 350 million -- number of @entity8 sold 119 -- number of countries where @entity5 is available 26 million -- number of songs available on @entity5 more than 1 million -- number of songs sold on @entity5 during its first week in april 2003			2
