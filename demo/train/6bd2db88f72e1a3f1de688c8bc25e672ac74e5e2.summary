-- former @entity2 @entity1 knew he had found his dream job at @entity4			1
@entity1 grew up going to the national parks on family vacations , exploring parks in @entity8 , @entity9 and the rest of the @entity11			1
after he left the @entity2 in 2002 , his combat tour in @entity13 was still on his mind			2
just walking into a convenience store created sensory overload			2
so he bought a backpack , filled it with camping gear and hiked national parks extending from @entity20 to the @entity21			1
" where i had just come from was so austere , " he said			0
" so the national parks were the perfect place to be by myself			1
it 's the best thing i could do			1
" @entity1 had worked as an enlisted public affairs specialist in the military and had run his own video production business after being discharged			0
keeping his eyes open for jobs in the federal government , he noticed a job posting for a spokesman at @entity4 that seemed too good to be true			1
with his wife 's encouragement , he applied and got the job two weeks later			1
@entity4 's military history @entity37 is one of many military veterans who have worked for the @entity39 and at @entity4 , the nation 's first national park , established in 1872			1
the @entity42 administered the park for the first 32 years of its existence , and many of its first park rangers were veterans			1
@entity4 's headquarters are old @entity42 barracks dating to the early 1900s			1
about 300 full - time employees live there year - round			0
" it 's pretty rural and only packed with visitors in the summer , " he said			1
" we have seven months of winter , so you have to be really outdoorsy and love your surroundings			0
" it can also be brutal			0
" nature is what 's driving life here , " he said			1
" we 've seen the most brutal acts of nature happen in our front yard			0
i accept it because i know where i live , and i know what i 'm seeing			0
" i saw an injured bison on the road , and i know it 's going to be food for a grizzly bear later this afternoon			1
that 's hard for people to get their heads around			1
they think it 's cruel and inhumane for some of the natural processes to occur			1
but they get it when we explain it to them			0
" @entity4 stats : @entity4 was the fourth - most - visited national park ( @entity87 ) in 2012 , with 3.4 million visitors last year			1
the location : @entity4 is located on 2.2 million acres , mostly in @entity91 's northwest corner			1
( just 1 % is in @entity92 , and 3 % is in @entity93			0
) although @entity4 is open year - round , just one road from @entity96 , @entity93 , to @entity97 , @entity91 , is plowed in winter			1
see an interactive map of @entity4 if you go : park admission is $ 25 for a private , non-commercial vehicle , $ 20 for a snowmobile or motorcycle and $ 12 for visitors ages 16 and older arriving via foot , bike , skis , etc. passes are valid for seven days and grant admission to @entity110			1
( save your receipt for proof of payment			0
) permits are required for boating , fishing , backcountry camping and weddings			0
for a day trip , do n't miss : @entity120 , in the center of the park			1
while @entity124 is the big draw for first - time visitors to @entity4 , it can take the whole day to enjoy and get around the geyser basin where it 's located			1
@entity1 likes to send people about 25 miles away to @entity120 , which features the @entity130 of the @entity4			1
formed by the @entity132 , the canyon is about 20 miles long with widths ranging from 1,500 to 4,000 feet and depths of 800 to 1,200 feet			0
it 's also fairly young , estimated to be between 10,000 to 14,000 years old			1
" i think it 's the prettiest part of the park , " @entity1 said			1
" it 's got bears , elk , bison , wolves			2
if you 're going to see any animal , you 're going to see it in the middle of the park			2
" if you 're determined to see @entity124 , do n't miss the nearby @entity148			1
" the vibrancy of the colors around the spring are created by natural bacteria , " @entity1 said			1
" those are quintessential colors of science and @entity4			1
" favorite less - traveled spot : @entity37 's favorite spot does n't have a name			2
it 's in the northeast corner of the park , just outside @entity160 and near @entity96 , @entity93			1
about 55 miles from his home in @entity97 , @entity91 , " it 's the most rugged and mountainous part of the park , " he said			1
" it feels like you 're in the @entity167 with rugged young mountains that pop up , getting most of the snowfall in the park and raging rivers			2
there are n't a lot of visitors			0
" his family hikes there year - round , snowshoes and skis there in the winter and has picnics there in the summer			0
" it 's where we see the most wildlife , " he said			2
favorite spot to view wildlife : the rangers will tell you that anytime you go off trail anywhere in the park , there 's a good chance you 'll spot wildlife			1
still , @entity1 likes his chances on the drive through @entity200			0
early in the morning or later in the evening , when he 's driving the only car on the road , @entity1 likes to stop at a pullout about halfway to @entity160 , where he can sometimes hear wolves howling			2
he does n't have to hike more than one or two miles for a good chance to see a wolf pack or any of other animals that live in the park			2
although the spot is well - known in the wolf watching and backcountry hiking community , he said , " most people would drive right through it			0
" most magical moment in the park : he remembers a moment with a five - point bull elk at @entity218 in 2011			2
near @entity200 , the lake usually fills during the spring melt and dries up by july			0
but sometimes it can last throughout the summer			0
as the sun was setting , " i sat down on a rock to look at the water , heard a snorting noise and saw a five - point bull elk swim out into the water in front of me , " he said			0
" i just saw his great big eyes and heard his breathing , swimming almost silently			0
" @entity1 watched the elk swim to the side of the lake and climb out of the water			0
" he shook himself off -- he weighed 700 pounds maybe -- and ran over the other side of the road into the trees			0
before he disappeared into those trees , he looked at me			0
a wildlife - to - human moment			0
" watch the elk swim through @entity218 funniest moment at the park : moments after he spotted that bull elk , a tourist asked him , " where 's the wildlife ? " every day , people come up to him and ask him that question , and " behind them are 30 elk " or other wild animals , he says			1
" i think that 's pretty funny			2
" " you can drive around for two weeks and not see a bear , and then three show up in my front yard , " he said			0
" you just get lucky			0
" a ranger 's request : do n't try to admire the wildlife and scenery while driving			2
" we have so many vehicle accidents here because ( people ) are trying to see the whole thing through their windshields while they 're driving , " @entity1 said			0
" i do n't take my eyes off the cars passing me for a second , and everyone is in their cars with their heads turned sideways			0
" do n't stop in the @entity276 , either , although visitors often do			0
" you can start your own traffic jam , " he said			0
instead , stop in pullouts and park your car to admire the spectacular natural landscape			2
another request : stay away from large animals			0
for three months in the summer , park rangers use orange cones to block off elk calves resting in the grass			2
" female elk with calves can take people out , " @entity1 said			0
another park he likes to visit : @entity294			2
even though it 's next door in @entity93 , it 's a nine - hour drive for @entity37 and his family to get there			2
" it 's just spectacular , " he said			2
" there 's a wildness about @entity302 that makes it even more dangerous and adventurous than @entity4 , " he said			1
" you can step off the road and walk five minutes into the woods and be completely lost			0
if you step away from your car , make sure have your gps and radio and bear spray			0
