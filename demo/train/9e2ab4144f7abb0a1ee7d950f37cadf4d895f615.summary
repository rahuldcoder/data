@entity0 , @entity1 -- an airstrike saturday hit a parking lot outside the compound in central @entity0 of @entity1 leader @entity7 , killing three people , a government spokesman said			1
@entity9 said he had no information about the identities of the dead in the attack on the compound , called @entity14			2
the attack , presumably from @entity17 forces , came shortly after deputy foreign minister @entity18 announced that @entity1 's army will withdraw from the besieged coastal city of @entity21 and allow tribal leaders to attempt to deal with the rebels			1
" the situation in @entity21 will be eased and will be dealt with by the tribes surrounding @entity21 , " @entity18 told reporters			1
" you will see how they will be swift and quick and fast			0
" he added that the residents of @entity1 's third - largest city have been in the grip of the conflict			2
" the tactic of the @entity1 army is to have a surgical solution , but it does n't work , " @entity18 said			0
" with the airstrikes , it does not work			0
we will leave it for the tribes and @entity21 people to deal with the situation -- either to use force or negotiations			1
" he added , " the tribal leaders have issued an ultimatum to the military saying they will deal with the situation if the military can not do it			2
... they will speak with the rebels and , if there is no solution , they will fight the rebels			2
" in the rebel stronghold of @entity60 , in the east , rebel spokesman @entity57 reacted to @entity18 's comments with laughter and derision			1
" this only confirms that he wants to save face , " @entity57 said of @entity7			1
" this confirms that our rebels in @entity21 have liberated @entity21 and that @entity1 is still in one piece , not two , the way @entity7 hoped			1
in regards to the tribes fighting the rebels ; how would you believe that a person will fight his brother ? and who are the tribes that are supporting @entity7 , anyway ? " he predicted that if @entity7 forces leave @entity21 , " it will mean that this game is over			1
" but he added that he did not necessarily believe they will			0
earlier friday , @entity57 said that @entity1 rebels had wrested control of a key building in @entity21 and made other advances in the city			1
" this victory is quite important for us , and it shows that we are advancing and we are heading in the right direction , " @entity57 told @entity2 about the rebels ' control of the @entity91 , which is on the main thoroughfare , @entity93			1
its height provided snipers with a clear view of surrounding streets			0
@entity57 said some fighters loyal to @entity7 were negotiating to surrender their weapons to the rebels in exchange for the rebels ' assurances that they would not be harmed			1
but the carnage of recent days was on display at the city 's hospitals , where doctors were working long hours and beds were full			2
@entity7 's forces retain control of roads that lead to the seacoast city			1
but access by sea remains open , and on friday another aid ship chartered by the @entity120 left @entity60 for @entity21 carrying food , medicine and other supplies			1
the organization said it hopes to rescue more casualties and stranded migrants from the city			0
" given the increasing number of casualties in @entity21 and the thousands of lives that are in danger , we felt a responsibility to act , " said foreign minister @entity128 of @entity129 , which is helping fund the chartered vessels			1
" colonel @entity7 's forces have agreed to allow ships into the port to evacuate civilians and we have requested that the @entity120 undertake an emergency operation on our behalf , " @entity128 said			1
at a news conference in @entity151 , @entity149 's top military chief acknowledged a stalemate on @entity1 's eastern front , around the oil towns of @entity146 and @entity147 , both of which have changed hands several times			2
" the regime forces have changed their tactics , and changed it in a way where they essentially look like the opposition forces , so it 's become a much more difficult fight , " @entity156 adm. @entity155 , the chairman of the @entity157 , told reporters			2
" and as i 've observed in recent days , essentially it is very much stalemate - like in the vicinity of @entity146 and @entity147 , " @entity155 said			0
he said the outcome -- toppling @entity7 after nearly 42 years of rule -- is certain			1
but the timing , he said , is " difficult to predict			0
" also friday , sen. @entity173 made an unannounced visit to @entity60 , the rebel stronghold , where residents welcomed him			2
some waved @entity149 flags , some chanted , " thank you @entity173 ! thank you @entity180 ! thank you @entity149 ! we need freedom ! @entity7 go away ! " the senator from @entity185 's arrival came a day after the @entity149 said it was deploying drones to @entity1			1
@entity173 , a proponent of beefing up @entity149 efforts to oust @entity7 , said the drones will increase @entity17 's capability but not enough to break a " significant degree of stalemate			1
" though he opposes sending @entity149 ground troops to @entity1 , he said the international community needs to " facilitate " weapons and training for the rebels			0
@entity173 , the highest - ranking @entity149 official to visit @entity1 since the conflict erupted in february , challenged critics of intervention to tour @entity60 , as he did friday , to see a " powerful and hopeful example of what a free @entity1 can be			0
" the top @entity201 on the @entity202 stopped by a hospital and suggested that @entity205 powers are not doing enough for the rebels			0
" let 's face it : this is not a fair fight , " said @entity173 , a decorated @entity209 veteran with clout in defense circles			2
" maybe we should be doing everything we can to help these people and maybe we 're not , and they 're dying			0
" @entity149 predator drones were deployed thursday in the @entity219 nation as part of the @entity17 - led military efforts there			0
but as of friday night , the drones had made no strikes , said a @entity226 spokesman , navy capt. @entity225			0
@entity149 defense secretary @entity227 said earlier that bad weather forced the deployed drones to return			0
@entity1 's deputy foreign minister told reporters that the decision reflects poorly on @entity149 president @entity180			0
" he is involving himself in a dirty game , " @entity18 said			0
" this is will be another crime against humanity committed by the @entity149 administration and i feel very sad for president @entity180 to be involved in such a thing			0
" @entity2 's @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 and @entity243 contributed to this report .			0
