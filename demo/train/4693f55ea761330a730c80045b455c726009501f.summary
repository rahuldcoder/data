" the violent incident came amid a dispute between @entity16 's mother , @entity61 , and @entity4 over how to deal with their son 's psychological issues , which are outlined in legal document filed in @entity66 's lawsuit against @entity4			1
she said she put her acting career on hold for two decades to raise the child while @entity4 , one of @entity6 's highest - paid actors , pursued his career			1

the source disputed an initial report that the fight began when @entity34 told @entity16 he could not order a certain item from a restaurant menu			2

" i do n't want to have anything to do with my mother			0
any problems that i have ever had is because of the relationship that i had with my mother			0
" when @entity66 heard the quote , she called it " an absolute disgrace , " suggesting that @entity4 's lawyer solicited a statement from her son while he was under a psychiatric hold at @entity133			1

i built that with myself and my team			0
" she said she fired @entity34 three years ago , but @entity4 rehired him , she said			0
@entity4 , in a statement from his spokeswoman friday , called @entity66 's comments blaming him for his son 's psychiatric troubles " unfortunate and inappropriate			1
" " this is a time to focus only on giving love and full support to @entity16 , not an opportunity to lay blame on his father , a man who loves his son very deeply , " @entity4 said			1
@entity66 said @entity4 was rarely around for her son growing up , while she dealt with his medical and psychological issues			2
" for 18 years , i raised @entity16 so @entity4 could go be @entity4 , and go be a superstar , and he did , " she said			1
" so i raised this boy , 24/7 , we were glued to the hip			0
" after @entity16 's 18th birthday , his father " orchestrated " his removal from her care by persuading the employees she hired to work for him and giving @entity16 his own home and money , @entity66 said			1
" they all go work with @entity4 because he has the money and he has the bank account and he has the fame , and i do n't , " she said			2
@entity16 's special needs were not being met without her , she said			1
" my son right now has been under the care of @entity4 , " she said			2
" that did n't work			0
it 's very obvious it did n't work			0
it failed miserably , failed miserably			0
" @entity21 , @entity4 's lawyer , said @entity66 's lawsuit against @entity4 is her motivation for attacking her son 's father			1
" ms. @entity61 comments about mr. @entity4 are absurd , and it 's very unfortunate that she would lash out like this because her son does not want to have anything to do with her , " @entity21 said			1
" this is clearly all about money for ms. @entity61			0
" @entity66 's lawyer said she would file for conservatorship of her son next week so she could ensure that he will get the care he needs when he is eventually released from the psychiatric hold			1
" i 'd like my son to be with his mom , where it worked , " @entity66 said			0
" i 'd like my son to be in an environment where it worked			0
