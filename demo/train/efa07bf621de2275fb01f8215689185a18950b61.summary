-- " who controls the past controls the future			2
" president @entity5 's former aides say @entity7 's budget repudiates @entity8			1
it 's a line from @entity11 's novel " 1984			0
" but it could also serve as the rallying cry for two groups battling over president @entity7 's ambitious domestic agenda -- and the legacy of two former presidents			1
critics of @entity7 's proposed $ 3.5 trillion federal budget say he 's poised to jeopardize the economic gains unleashed by president @entity5			1
they say he will make the same mistakes that president @entity22 did when he committed massive amounts of federal money to create a slew of anti-poverty programs dubbed " @entity27			1
" " @entity27 created a lot of programs and wasted a lot of money , " said @entity28 , a former @entity5 speechwriter and adviser			1
" the biggest war on poverty was the economic boom started by @entity5			0
" but others like @entity38 , @entity22 's senior domestic adviser , say the notion that the @entity27 was a failure is one of the " greatest political scams " in @entity43 history			1
@entity45 leaders who have labeled @entity7 's budget proposals socialist are rehashing the rhetoric their predecessors used to attack @entity27 programs like @entity50 40 years ago , @entity38 says			1
" i 'm hearing the same round of arguments , " @entity38 said			0
" the @entity45 said that if you provide @entity50 and preschool education to poor kids , it would ' @entity53 ' our kids and be communistic			0
" ' failure ' of the @entity27 the clash between both points of view centers on @entity7 's plan for reviving the nation 's economy			1
the @entity66 and the @entity67 passed similar versions of @entity7 's $ 3.5 trillion budget for 2010 last week			1
the budget did n't receive a single @entity45 vote in either chamber			0
both chambers will meet after @entity75 recess to produce a final budget			0
even before last week 's vote , though , @entity7 's budget was creating a partisan wedge			1
proponents said it would use trillions of dollars to transform education , spark a green industrial revolution and provide health care to all @entity85			0
@entity1 political analyst @entity86 said @entity7 's budget " set forth the most ambitious reform agenda of any president since @entity22			1
" @entity86 's comment could be taken as a compliment or a reprimand , depending on one 's historical point of view			0
@entity94 , author of " @entity95 : the @entity98 of the campaign that started it all , " took it as a warning			0
his model for reviving the nation is @entity5 , who moved " power from the government to the people " by cutting taxes and making government less intrusive			1
@entity113 , alluding to an alleged @entity5 quip that " @entity22 declared war on poverty and poverty won , " says out - of - wedlock births , illiteracy and bloated federal programs increased during the @entity27			1
he says @entity120 and @entity121 , two vaunted @entity27 programs that provide health care to the poor and elderly , are now virtually bankrupt			0
" all evidence says that the @entity27 was a failure , " @entity113 said			0
@entity28 , @entity5 's speechwriter , says @entity7 's budget would also create tension between people who fought their way up the economic ladder and those who did not			1
under @entity7 , the well - off would be " brought back down through higher taxes and subsidizing benefits for people who have not worked as hard			2
" @entity7 's budget is influenced by the president 's previous job as a community organizer , @entity28 says			1
" you ca n't have been a community organizer and not have in your mindset that agencies of the government exist to , as @entity7 said , to ' spread the wealth , ' '' @entity28 said			2
if @entity7 wants to look at an economic blueprint for lifting the nation out of a nasty recession , he should look at @entity5 , @entity28 says			2
@entity5 's tax cuts helped end the deep recession he inherited when he came into office , he said			2
the economy took off , and everyone benefited			0
" i would argue that the biggest war on poverty took place when the economy started booming in 1983 , '' @entity28 said			0
the ' myth ' of @entity5 's tax cuts other analysts had a different take on the legacy of the @entity158 and what it can teach @entity7			1
@entity160 , author of " tear down this myth : how the @entity163 has @entity164 , '' says @entity8 is built on a fable			2
@entity5 did n't prove that tax cuts and small government lead to economic growth , because he never consistently did both , he says			2
@entity160 says @entity5 did cut taxes in 1981 but raised them in succeeding years			2
he also expanded the federal government and created a huge national debt			0
" his initial 1981 tax cuts went so far that he was actually forced to increase taxes a half - dozen times in the years that followed , something you never hear about , " @entity160 said			0
@entity7 would do better to follow the example of @entity22 , not @entity5 , says @entity38 , @entity22 's senior domestic adviser			1
he says @entity22 's @entity27 was designed to give the most vulnerable @entity85 -- the poor , the elderly , the disabled and racial minorities -- the same opportunities as the affluent			1
" @entity27 saw government as providing a hand up , not a handout , " said @entity38 , who wrote about his time with the president in " @entity186 of @entity22			1
" he says the @entity27 proved that government was n't incompetent			2
@entity22 persuaded @entity187 to pass at least 100 @entity27 proposals			2
programs awarded college students financial aid , gave struggling families food stamps and gave millions of @entity85 access to health insurance for the first time			0
it also reduced poverty , @entity38 says			0
about 22 percent of @entity85 lived below the poverty line when @entity22 took office in 1963			2
by 1970 , when the impact of @entity27 programs was being felt , the poverty rate dropped to 12.6 percent , @entity38 says			0
( the poverty rate in 2007 was 12.5 percent , the @entity205 reported			0
) @entity38 , who calls @entity7 's budget a logical extension of the @entity27 , says @entity7 personally benefited from the @entity27 " crown jewel " : the @entity209 , which ensured @entity43 participation at the polls			1
" my @entity212 , @entity7 would n't be president if @entity22 had n't passed that civil rights law , " @entity38 said			2
" he would not have gotten the votes to get elected			0
" @entity216 , co-author of " @entity217 : @entity223 and the @entity224 in the 1960s , '' says the @entity27 also helped lay the foundation for the modern environmental movement with its passage of clean air and water laws			0
read why @entity216 says @entity7 ca n't create another @entity27 " we can find much to celebrate in those years in the 1960s when we see a burst of reform when the government is ready to face problems openly and decisively , " @entity216 said			1
there may be , however , one point of agreement for supporters and critics of @entity7 's domestic agenda			1
it was expressed by @entity28 , @entity5 's former speechwriter			0
when asked whether he was miffed that some people were now comparing @entity7 to @entity5 , he said his opposition to @entity7 's budget was based on something deeper : fear			1
he says the nation could become a @entity245 if @entity7 's approach does n't end a brutal recession			1
" it 's not a matter of pride but of practicality , " he said			0
" if this does n't work , we 're all in deep doo - doo			0

clash over @entity7 's budget centers on @entity85 's future , and past
@entity5 aides say @entity7 *forgets* lessons of @entity8
author says @entity5 raised taxes and increased size of government
@entity22 's senior aide says @entity22 's @entity27 was a success
