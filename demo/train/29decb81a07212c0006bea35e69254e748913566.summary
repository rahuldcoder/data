-- as investigators are determining whether a skull and bones discovered behind an abandoned @entity5 home on saturday are those of @entity6 , the lone suspect in her disappearance has been indicted in an assault from almost a decade ago -- a case that police say forensically links him to another female college student who vanished from the same area as @entity14			1
@entity15 was indicted by a grand jury in @entity17 , @entity5 on monday for the 2005 sexual assault on charges that also included attempted murder and abduction			1
according to the indictment , @entity15 , 32 , " did feloniously , willfully , deliberately , intentionally and with premeditation attempt to kill ( the victim ) in the commission of or subsequent to an abduction with the intent to defile			1
" the then - 26 - year - old victim in that attack was able to provide enough of a detailed description to yield a police sketch , one that years later would link @entity15 to the case of @entity33 , the @entity34 student who vanished in @entity35 in october 2009			1
@entity33 was found dead the following january			2
police at the time said " forensic evidence " linked the two cases			2
@entity41 prosecutor @entity40 said monday that he could not comment on how this investigation and indictment relates to the @entity33 or @entity14 cases , but said " the facts and details will be revealed in the judicial process			2
" @entity48 , @entity15 's @entity35 attorney in the @entity14 case , declined to comment when reached by @entity0 on monday			1
@entity14 last seen september 13 @entity14 , a @entity50 student , was last spotted on several surveillance cameras in @entity35 's @entity53 area on september 13			1
the footage showed her leaving the @entity56 around 2 a.m. , followed by a man investigators think to be @entity15			1
more than a month later , on october 18 , sgt. @entity59 of the @entity60 and his small search team were finishing up for the day when behind an abandoned home -- just eight miles from where @entity6 was last seen -- they found a skull and bones scattered across a creek bed			1
" it was not buried , and its location was not far from the road , " he told a local television station			0
" there was not any crushing of any bones			0
as far as the skull , everything looked to be intact to me			0
" @entity76 was a pair of black pants , similar to ones @entity14 was wearing when she was last seen			0
" i do believe @entity81 wanted us to find what we found , " @entity59 said			2
" i do n't know how else to explain it other than something inside me told me to just continue to look			0
" after saturday 's discovery , the weekend 's remaining public searches were canceled so that authorities could focus their attention " on recent evidence , " according to the @entity91 of @entity92			2
furthermore , police now consider the @entity14 case " a death investigation , " said county police chief @entity96			0
" today 's discovery is a significant development , and we have a great deal of work ahead of us , " @entity96 said			0
" we can not and we will not jump to any conclusions			0
" forensic psychologist @entity103 told @entity0 affiliate @entity104 that forensic work could take some time			0
" if it is @entity6 , 100 % , then at least they have their child home , " he said , referring to @entity14 's parents , @entity107 and @entity108			1
the @entity113 said it did n't know how long it will take for the forensic results to come back .			0
