editor 's note : @entity2 is the political editor for @entity3			0
@entity2 says @entity4 came out ahead in the honorary degree flap with scholarship named after him			1
@entity7 ( @entity3 ) -- keep the honorary degree -- i 'd take the scholarship program			1
@entity12 's refusal last week to present an honorary degree to president @entity4 cast an unnecessary dark cloud over the school and forced officials to do something they apparently were trying to avoid : recognize the president for his accomplishments			1
instead of giving him a piece of paper , the school now has named its " most important scholarship program " after him -- and the controversy still has n't gone away			1
initially a university spokesperson told @entity27 , " his body of work is yet to come			0
that 's why we 're not recognizing him with a degree at the beginning of his presidency			0
" that is true -- we do not yet know what @entity4 will accomplish as the 44th president of the @entity41			0
but @entity12 's own guidelines state that a degree is given to those who have made " significant contributions to education and society over the course of a person 's career			2
" now , you might not have voted for @entity4 , and perhaps you do n't agree with his policies , but he was a @entity41 senator , a community organizer , and a lecturer on constitutional law			0
and is n't @entity4 's election as the first @entity58 - @entity41 president a " significant " achievement in this country ? @entity62 sen. @entity61 -- @entity4 's opponent in the 2008 election -- noted the historic significance of @entity4 's victory in his election night concession speech			1
so what would stop the @entity12 elders from doing so ? after all , sen. @entity70 was awarded a degree after serving one term in the @entity73 , while @entity75 @entity74 had been on the @entity76 for three years before receiving her honorary degree			2
legendary broadcaster @entity78 and labor activist @entity79 were also awarded honorary degrees			0
@entity12 president @entity81 said the school had always intended to honor the president , but had n't decided how to do so			2
we do know that @entity12 had decided how not to recognize @entity4 : with an honorary degree			1
as pressure built up over the past week , @entity12 needed to move fast to try and push that dark cloud off of the university			0
@entity12 's solution was unveiled over the weekend : name a scholarship program after @entity4			1
" naming this scholarship program after president @entity4 that will affect the lives of thousands of students is an honor befitting , not only the president 's exceptional achievements , but also his values as an individual , " @entity81 said in a statement released by the school			2
" the president @entity102 program will be a legacy that will endure and inspire others for generations to come			0
" an honorary degree or a named scholarship program ? i would take the scholarship program			1
" we hope that the recent discussion of honorary degrees will not detract from the honor and thrill that @entity12 -- and indeed all of @entity62 -- is experiencing in anticipation of his visit , " @entity81 said in the statement			0
" i am honored , as are our faculty , staff and students , that president @entity4 will give his first commencement speech as president of the @entity41 at @entity12			2
" @entity81 need not worry			0
i doubt that most @entity41 will look down upon the students and faculty for @entity12 's bewildering decision not to grant @entity4 an honorary degree			1
i acknowledge , at first blush i really did n't think this was a big deal			0
so what if @entity4 was n't presented with an honorary degree ? then i came to my senses			1
is n't it simply common sense and common courtesy to present the president of the @entity41 with an honorary degree -- especially if you invite him to participate in your commencement ceremony ? there still is time for the university to reverse its decision and present him with that piece of paper			2
but even if @entity12 chooses not to do so , i still think the president comes out on top by having the " most important scholarship program " named in his honor			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : @entity12 decided not to give @entity4 an honorary degree
@entity12 said no degree because his " body of work is yet to come "
@entity159 : is n't *winning* office as first *african* - american a significant achievement ?
he says @entity4 comes out ahead by having scholarship program named after him
