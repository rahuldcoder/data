-- @entity1 was having a birthday party , but this was not just your garden variety , chocolate cake , two kinds of ice cream , balloons , and a piñata type soiree			1
no , this would be an affair to remember			1
@entity12 has learned the hard way about when it 's important to listen to loved ones			1
this would be even more fabulous than @entity18 's tie - dye - your - own - pillowcase gala or @entity21 's macramé - your - own - bracelet bash			1
this was to be a build - your - own - terrarium shindig , complete with colored sand and plastic stones and an incredibly classy assortment of glass goldfish bowls			1
at the time ( the time being about 34 years ago ) , it seemed like a very big deal -- i mean , let 's be honest here , it would still be a big deal to go to a party where you get to build your own terrarium ... in , you know , a kind of retro , ' 70s , ironic , hipster way			1
so there i sat , looking out the den window , which gave me a clear view to the driveway while i waited for my ride to come spirit me away			2
actually , it had n't been our den since my grandparents returned from their life in @entity54 and my folks rented a hospital bed to turn the den into my grandmother 's bedroom			1
i loved my grandmother , but i ca n't say i ever really got to know her			1
she was the lady who played bingo and walked with a cane and kept a plump red tomato pincushion next to the creaky old foot - pedal - powered singer sewing machine			2
i remember that she put up her own pickles and draped strudel dough across the kitchen table , and i know that she learned to reupholster her own furniture and got her first driver 's license when she was deep into her 50s , and i 'm acutely aware that she spoke to my grandfather in a very stern @entity73 whenever he tried to convince me to watch " the @entity74			2
" my grandmother endured an awful lot from the man , but no grandchild of hers was going to be forced to watch @entity79 so long as she still had breath in her body			1
anyway , the sun was going down and my ride was running late and my grandmother started to talk			1
i thought she was going to warn me to be careful of something or other , because she was from the generation who believed that pigeons carry polio and she worried a lot , but if she was anxious about anything that night , she did n't show it			2
" i used to love to go to parties , " she told me			2
she might as well have said that she used to enjoy scaling @entity93 in flip - flops and a tutu			2
i was pretty sure i 'd heard all the stories from my grandmother 's life -- and none of them involved a party			1
@entity0 : how to write your own memoir the talk i 'd heard was always the same : she and her mother and her five brothers and sisters starving through the bitter @entity112 winters in a little village whose name sounded like a sneeze			1
i knew about the malnutrition , the crippling rickets , the father who slaved away for years in @entity118 trying to earn enough money to bring his wife and children to @entity122 and how when he finally did manage to save enough , the man he entrusted with the job of bringing the family over disappeared with the money ( was he killed ? did he steal it ? ) , leaving my great - grandfather to start all over again			2
i 'd heard how my great - uncles @entity129 and @entity130 would scrounge through fields looking for anything edible while my grandmother supported everyone with her job as a maid to the butcher 's wife , and i knew by heart the story of how she lost that job because the woman caught her taking a sip of milk			1
i also knew how she met @entity144 , the love of her life , who my great - aunt @entity147 swore looked " exactly like a young @entity148 , " and that he died a few weeks after she married him , though she never stopped wearing his ring			2
i knew that the first son she had with my grandfather had died , and that on a friday afternoon in 1939 , her father , the man who worked so hard to bring the family here , died , too , after being pushed off the roof of a building in an anti-semitic attack			2
and , of course , i knew that she worked nonstop to build a better life for her children			2
but i realize now that i only knew those stories because they were told to me by other people			2
the night of @entity1 's terrarium party , my grandmother was telling me the things she wanted me to know			1
she talked about dances and boys and a silvery blue dress she 'd sewn with her sisters			1
she told me about a time when all her friends were doubled over with laughter because ... well , i 'm not really sure what it was they found so funny			1
there was a honk and the glare of headlights , so i gave my grandmother a fast peck on the cheek and flew straight out the door			1
she went into the hospital the next morning , and she never came out			0
i sit playing @entity181 with the great - granddaughter @entity182 never got to meet			0
@entity187 closes her eyes , blows on the dice , and whispers , " @entity184 , c'mon , @entity183 needs a pair of deuces			0
" i have no idea why my 6 - year - old sounds like @entity193 , but i make a mental note to quit letting her play blackjack with the doormen			0
she rolls " snake eyes " and becomes my little girl again			0
" i want a do - over , @entity183			0
" i start to explain that we do n't really get do - overs in this world , that you kind of have to play it as it lays			0
i believe the parenting books call this a " teachable moment , " but my follow - through leaves much to be desired			0
i hand @entity208 the dice and say , " go for it , kid			0
" the truth is , i want a do - over , too			0
i have ignored my instincts , i have embraced my neuroses , and there have been more than a few serious lapses in judgment over the years -- hell , i once painted my bathroom aubergine			0
but if i could get just one night back , it would be a chilly october evening when nothing mattered more to me than hanging with my friends in @entity1 's basement			1
@entity0 : one thing @entity12 would never change i would have taken off my coat and sat back down , only this time i 'd have faced my grandmother instead of the driveway			1
i would have asked her if the good times outweighed the bad , if there were nights she 'd do differently , if she 'd ever felt like giving up -- or if that was even an option			0
i never told her how smart and talented and brave and lovely i thought she was			0
i never heard what was so great about @entity236 and @entity237 in @entity238			0
i never found out what she did to make her skin so soft and her matzo balls so firm or if she 'd have preferred it the other way around			0
and i never thanked her for being my go - to grandma in the unconditional goodness department			0
@entity187 and i finish the game and say our goodnights			0
i am eager to return a couple of calls , get her lunch packed for school , and watch the episode of " @entity255 " i 've got waiting on our dvr			0
but my daughter is feeling chatty			1
" @entity183 , " she begins , " do you know why the @entity260 have swords that match their ball gowns ? " before i can answer , she announces , " it 's because they 're royal squashbucklers			0
" i tell her i 'm pretty sure the word is swashbucklers , and she tells me she 's pretty sure i 'm wrong and goes on talking			0
she does n't want to let go of the night , and so i nudge away two stuffed poodles and curl up beside her			0
the calls and the lunch and even @entity270 can wait , because i have learned the hard way that my job is to sit quietly in the dark and listen to whatever my daughter has to say			1
