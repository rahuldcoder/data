@entity1 a @entity4 stampede in @entity5 that killed 36 people and injured 49 others was " totally preventable , " local officials said wednesday			1
" we feel very sad and extremely guilty , " vice mayor @entity8 told a nationally televised press conference			1
" we offer our deepest condolences to the victims , and express our deepest apologies to their families as well as the injured and their families			0
" an investigating team said the stampede happened at 11:35 p.m. local time when huge crowds trying to reach the iconic riverfront promenade , known as the @entity20 , clashed with others attempting to leave on a staircase			2
most of the victims were in their 20s with the youngest being only 12 years old			0
of the injured , three remained in a serious condition in hospital as of wednesday			0
investigators blamed various government agencies of the city 's @entity31 district , whose jurisdiction includes the @entity20 , for the fatal incident			0
they said local officials were " ill - prepared " for the crowds and " mishandled " the aftermath			1
although the district authorities had earlier called off a popular riverfront light show on @entity4 , thousands of revelers -- unaware of the cancellation due to the lack of official updates -- still flocked to the @entity20 , investigators said			2
they singled out the district police department for severely underestimating the crowd size -- which had reached 310,000 people by midnight -- and assigning fewer than 600 officers and other security personnel to the area			0
three top district officials in @entity31 have been sacked -- the local @entity52 boss , his deputy and the district police chief , and a total of 11 officials face punishment for their role in the incident			2
in a nod to public criticism , the ruling @entity52 's disciplinary arm in @entity5 also confirmed on wednesday that several @entity31 district officials -- including the fired @entity52 boss and his deputy -- violated party regulations by wining and dining for free at a high - end @entity68 restaurant on the @entity20 shortly before the stampede			1
after @entity73 president @entity72 warned officials about public safety following the stampede , authorities across the country have rushed to cancel large gatherings , ranging from pop concerts to shopping festivals			0
but @entity8 , @entity5 's vice mayor , said that , after careful risk assessments , officials have green - lighted most planned events in the city for the upcoming @entity85 celebrations in february -- though the popular lantern festival at the ancient @entity87 wo n't go ahead .			1
