-- it 's become a go - to tool for journalists , a digital man - on - the - street interview when big news breaks : see what they 're saying on @entity8			1
there 's just one problem with that , says the @entity12			1
opinions expressed in the rapid - fire twitter echo chamber , particularly in response to political news , are often at odds with the general public 's			1
the differences ? sometimes @entity8 is more liberal			2
at other times , it 's more conservative			2
and it 's very nearly always more negative			2
" overall , the reaction to political events on @entity8 reflects a combination of the unique profile of active @entity8 users and the extent to which events engage different communities and draw the comments of active users , " the report reads			1
" while this provides an interesting look into how communities of interest respond to different circumstances , it does not reliably correlate with the overall reaction of adults nationwide			0
" in the yearlong study , @entity12 focused on political events such as the result of the 2012 presidential election , the first presidential debate between president @entity47 and challenger @entity48 and several speeches given by @entity47			1
some examples : when @entity47 won re-election , public opinion polls suggested 52 % of the public was pleased and 45 % unhappy			1
on @entity8 , a full 77 % of tweets about his win were positive and only 23 % negative			2
similarly , only 20 % of the public told pollsters they thought @entity47 did a better job than @entity48 in their first debate ( the one in which @entity47 was criticized for looking tired and unfocused )			0
but 59 % of tweets favored him			0
part of that might be explained by looking at who uses @entity8			0
@entity12 's research shows that @entity8 users are considerably younger than the general public and more likely to lean @entity70			1
in a 2012 survey , half of adults who said they posted news on @entity8 were younger than 30 , compared with 23 % of all adults			2
and 57 % of those who posted news on @entity8 were either @entity70 or leaned @entity70 , compared with 46 % of the general public			1
but @entity8 pundits do n't always lean to the left			0
nearly half of the @entity81 public ( 48 % ) thought @entity47 did a good job on his second inaugural address			0
but only 13 % of the tweets about it echoed that opinion			0
opinions about sen. @entity88 being nominated as @entity47 's secretary of state split the general public : 39 % approved , 36 % disapproved and 26 % had no opinion			1
on @entity8 , a measly 6 % expressed support , while 32 % were negative and a clear majority , 62 % , expressed no opinion			1
the reason for such a swing , @entity12 said , is that on @entity8 , unlike in opinion polls , users decide what they think is important enough to mention publicly			1
a generally popular event might not be portrayed that way if an angry minority is more inspired to post about it			0
for example , nearly 14 million wrote on @entity8 about @entity47 's re-election while a mere 70,000 remarked on @entity88 's nomination			2
politics also reflect a truth that anyone who 's followed the @entity113 , @entity110 , debate nights or , really , any public event can attest to -- the @entity8 universe is never happier than when it 's being snarky , or downright nasty , to someone			1
" the overall negativity on @entity8 over the course of the campaign stood out , " @entity12 writes			1
" for both candidates , negative comments exceeded positive comments by a wide margin throughout the fall campaign season			0
" there were more negative than positive comments about @entity47 and @entity48 on @entity8			2
the negative comments about @entity47 bounced back and forth between 40 % to 50 % throughout the campaign , while positives went up to about 30 % and down into the teens			0
( remember , lots of comments can be neutral )			0
@entity48 's negatives were higher			0
usually , between 50 % to 60 % of talk about him was not nice , while positives only broke above 20 % during the campaign 's final days			0
another thing to keep in mind when monitoring the conversation on @entity8 : while it seems to be omnipresent among the digitally connected ( yes , like we journalists tend to be ) , its overall reach is modest compared to other media			0
in the @entity12 's 2012 news consumption survey , just 13 % of adults said they ever use @entity8 or read @entity8 messages			1
only 3 % said they regularly or sometimes tweet or retweet news or news headlines on @entity8 .			0

study : @entity8 opinions *rarely* reflect those of the general public
@entity12 says the most significant difference is that @entity8 's more negative
@entity8 users are younger than the public and more identify as politically liberal
but during some events , the site *skewed* too conservative vis - a - vis opinion polls
