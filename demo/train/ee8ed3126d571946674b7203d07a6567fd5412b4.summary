nearly 21 million people watched " @entity3 " when it aired on @entity2 in october			1
the documentary , produced by @entity5 and acquired by @entity6 , recounts the 2010 death of veteran @entity9 trainer @entity8 by a killer whale named @entity12 , a 12,000 - pound bull			1
the film challenges the concept of keeping killer whales for entertainment and implies @entity12 had been driven to madness by captivity			0
in the months since , a firestorm of debate over the controversy erupted			0
social media exploded with an outcry to boycott @entity9 , the world 's largest marine park operator			1
protesters not only lined the streets outside @entity28 in @entity29 , the company 's flagship park , but the streets of @entity33 and @entity34 during the @entity35 and the @entity36			1
@entity37 , which owns a plane with a killer whale painted on it , also received a taste of the " @entity3 " backlash			1
a handful of protesters presented a petition to an airline spokeswoman asking it to end its business relationship with @entity9			2
@entity37 responded in a statement it was not contemplating changes to its multi-year contract with the entertainment company			0
perhaps the largest fallout was in the form of a virtual cavalcade of musicians backing out of @entity9 's " @entity55 " concert series			1
@entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 are among those who declined to perform at the theme park over the controversy			0
@entity9 has battled back against the claims " @entity3 " makes , calling the film grossly one - sided and the product of animal activists			1
the company has declined @entity2 's repeated requests for interviews , but has responded to written inquiries			2
" @entity3 is billed as a documentary , but instead of a fair and balanced treatment of a complex subject , the film is inaccurate and misleading and , regrettably , exploits a tragedy that remains a source of deep pain for @entity8 's family , friends and colleagues , " @entity9 said in a statement			1
" to promote its bias that killer whales should not be maintained in a zoological setting , the film paints a distorted picture that withholds from viewers key facts about @entity9 -- among them , that @entity9 is one of the world 's most respected zoological institutions , that @entity9 rescues , rehabilitates and returns to the wild hundreds of wild animals every year , and that @entity9 commits millions of dollars annually to conservation and scientific research			1
" in january , @entity8 's family distanced themselves from the documentary			2
" @entity3 is not @entity100 's story			1
@entity8 believed in the ethical treatment of animals			0
@entity100 followed her dreams and became a marine animal trainer			2
she loved the whales and was proud of her work as a trainer , " a statement on a charity website dedicated to the slain trainer said			0
" @entity100 would not have remained a trainer at @entity9 for 15 years if she felt that the whales were not well cared for			2
trainer safety was important to @entity100 , and it remains important to us as well			0
our family always supported @entity100 and we continue to support @entity100 's friends and co-workers who currently care for the animals she so loved			0
" former killer whale trainer @entity121 appeared in " @entity3 , " but after its airings has gone on to become one of the film 's most outspoken critics			1
" @entity9 has exemplified the best in care of their animals and personnel for nearly six decades , " @entity121 said			0
" the @entity3 crusade against @entity9 and zoological care in general is engineered by a perfect marriage between sensational animal rights organizations and disgruntled @entity135 employees			1
" meantime , the marine park giant announced record fourth - quarter results and record annual revenue results in january , indicating there appears to be no real impact on its business			1
but some animal activists say behind the scenes , @entity9 is worried			0
the company launched expensive full - page ads in @entity147 's top newspapers and local publications where its parks are located			2
a promoted link at the top of a @entity153 search takes internet users to a section within @entity9 's website called , " the truth about @entity3			1
" others have even suggested recent financial moves hint of trouble			0
in december , @entity9 's largest investor , the @entity161 , sold its majority ownership the month before @entity9 's own chairman sold more than a million dollars ' worth of his @entity9 stock			2
financial analysts cautioned that both cases may be routine investment transactions and not an indicator of any concerns			0
last weekend , @entity9 kicked off its concert series with @entity173 and @entity174 , and despite the protests outside â€” inside , the crowd was robust			0
the next scheduled acts , @entity179 and @entity180 , are also expected to perform before an at - capacity crowd , the company said			0
the show , much like the debate @entity3 continues to spark , goes on .			0
