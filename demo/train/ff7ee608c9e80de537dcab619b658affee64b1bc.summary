@entity0 -- rep. @entity2 boasted of having a " titanium spine " in an interview broadcast sunday , the day before she formally enters the race for the @entity7 presidential nomination in 2012			2
however , @entity2 had some difficulty in clarifying her stance on key issues and explaining federal funding that benefited her family in the interview on " @entity18 " and another one with the @entity16 program " @entity17			1
" " i have a titanium spine for doing what we need to do " to get the country turned around , @entity2 told @entity18 , later challenging a question about whether past misstatements showed she was " flaky " by saying : " i think that was insulting to say something like that , because i 'm a serious person			2
" the 55 - year - old @entity30 favorite from @entity31 has bolted into leading contention among @entity7 candidates so far after a strong performance earlier this month in a @entity36 @entity7 debate			0
she will announce her candidacy on monday in @entity38 , the state where she was born and an important first destination in presidential campaigning			1
" i have a distinct advantage there , i think , " @entity2 said of @entity38			1
she listed her accomplishments as a tax lawyer , legislator and mother , and cited her sincerity as a major strength in comparison to the other leading @entity7 contender early in the campaign -- former @entity52 gov. @entity50			0
" what people know about me is i do what i say and i say what i mean , " @entity2 said on @entity18 , calling herself a " fighter " and a " common - sense voice			0
" " i think people recognize i 'm very sincere in what i say			0
" however , she stopped short of calling @entity50 insincere , though she noted he has changed positions in the past on key issues including abortion			0
@entity2 , a deficit hawk who backs deep spending cuts to balance the federal budget , adopted a defensive posture when asked about a @entity72 report sunday on federal money that benefited her family -- including nearly $ 30,000 for a counseling clinic operated by her husband and almost $ 260,000 for a family farm			1
the money did n't directly benefit her family , she explained , saying the $ 30,000 was for training employees and the farm that got the $ 260,000 was owned by her father - in - law , so she and her husband did n't get any of it			1
asked about another roiling social issue -- gay marriage -- @entity2 said she supported both the right of states to pass laws on the matter and the superseding authority of a federal constitutional amendment on the issue			1
@entity94 's state legislature and governor have the right under the @entity97 to pass the law legalizing gay marriage , which happened friday , @entity2 said			1
she also backs a federal constitutional amendment that would define marriage as between a man and a woman , saying that would decide the issue once and for all			1
in the end , @entity2 said , it would be better to settle the matter with citizens voting on a constitutional amendment rather than @entity113 judges issuing a decision			1
asked on @entity16 whether she believes homosexuality is a choice , @entity2 said it was up to individuals to make their own decision and that she was n't judging anyone on the issue			2
she described herself as a @entity122 who gave her heart to @entity124 at age 15 and now gets guidance in her life and political career through prayer			0
her doctrine is rigid conservatism on economic and social issues , and she responds to most policy questions -- especially on the economy with withering criticism of president @entity136			0
" the president does n't seem to have an understanding of how the economy works , " @entity2 said on @entity16			1
" it does n't seem he has a basic understanding of how do the job of president of the @entity145			0
" she challenged the contention by the @entity147 , treasury secretary @entity148 and economic analysts that failing to raise the federal debt ceiling by august 2 would cause a negative market reaction			0
" it is scare tactics , " @entity2 said of such warnings , adding that the government takes in plenty of money to pay the interest it owes on federal debt and avoid default			2
in that case , she conceded , other spending such as funding the military would have to be cut			0
" it would be very tough love , " she conceded , adding that she had no intention of voting to raise the debt ceiling at this time			0
if president , @entity2 said , she would cut corporate taxes in several ways in order to spur job creation , but she stopped short of endorsing a call from her past to eliminate the minimum wage			2
@entity2 has a history of statements that media fact checkers such as @entity180 have revealed to be untrue , including false claims that @entity136 's trip to @entity184 cost taxpayers $ 200 million a day and that @entity136 had only issued one drilling permit since taking office			1
asked about that record , she responded : " i have n't misled people at all			1
" as a newcomer to presidential politics , @entity2 was n't asked sunday whether she would accept an invitation to run for vice president if defeated by another @entity7 candidate			2
she may have inadvertently tipped her hand on @entity18 , though , when she accidentally referred to @entity50 as " president @entity50 " before correcting herself .			0
