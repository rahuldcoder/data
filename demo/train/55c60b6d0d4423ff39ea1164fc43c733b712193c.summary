-- @entity2 's financial crisis claimed its second scalp in three days when @entity5 's @entity4 announced he will step down after parliament approves new austerity measures in an effort to stave off economic collapse			1
the scandal - plagued prime minister will follow his @entity13 counterpart @entity12 into early retirement as fears grow that @entity5 , the eurozone 's third largest economy , may default on its debt			1
@entity5 has failed to implement austerity measures designed to reduce its mammoth â ‚ ¬ 1.9 trillion debt load -- nearly six times that of @entity13 -- and the cost to the country of borrowing more money to pay off that debt is spiraling out of control			1
while no one knows yet whether @entity5 will default , analysts say that the country is vastly too big to bail out -- and that the consequences for the world economy of a default would be a disaster			2
what happens next ? much like @entity13 premier @entity12 , @entity4 said he will not resign until the government passes harsh austerity measures recommended by eurozone leaders aimed at trimming @entity5 's debt			1
the next step is for the @entity5 parliament to consider and vote on the measures -- which include tax rises and an increase in the retirement age -- within the next several weeks			0
after the parliamentary votes @entity4 will tender his resignation to president @entity48 , who will then begin consultations with lawmakers to decide whether to form a government or call for elections			0
@entity4 and members of the @entity55 party want elections as soon as possible , but other lawmakers and @entity2 leaders would like to see an interim government composed of non-partisan technocrats that could quickly implement austerity measures in order to reassure global markets and restore confidence in the country			1
business figures tapped to lead a potential technocratic interim government include @entity67 , chairman of @entity69 , and @entity70 , former ceo of @entity5 's largest bank @entity71			2
political options that have been floated include @entity73 , known to be @entity4 's hand - picked successor , @entity75 , @entity4 's chief of staff , or @entity77 , a former commissioner with the @entity78			0
no one is a fan of uncertainty , and no one is going to invest in a debt - ridden country without a plan for recovery -- much less one without a functioning government -- so @entity5 's short - term plan will be to get these austerity measures passed , see @entity4 off , and hold new elections so at least international lenders will know who they 're dealing with			1
check out @entity0 's interactive map of @entity2 debt at a glance what 's wrong with @entity5 ? the basic problem is that it 's becoming prohibitively expensive for @entity5 to borrow money to finance its debt -- a problem rooted in investor confidence in the debt - laden country			1
with a defunct government and a shrinking economy , @entity5 is finding it increasingly difficult to find people willing to lend it money in order to reduce its mammoth â ‚ ¬ 1.9 trillion debt load , which is nearly six times that of @entity13			2
the less confidence there is in a country , the higher the bond yields , or rate , that country will have to pay in order to secure more money			1
right now confidence in @entity5 is at a euro - era low , which means @entity5 is paying more than ever to finance its debt			2
business 360 blog on @entity5 : too big to fail , too big to bail what is a bond yield ? a bond yield is basically another term for the rate @entity5 has to pay to lenders who buy its government bonds			2
the 10 - year government bond is the standard bond used to measure the relative interest rates from country to country			0
a government raises money to pay its bills by selling these bonds -- so the higher the yield or rate , the more it costs @entity5 to borrow money in order to pay its debts			0
@entity5 's 10 - year bond yield hit a staggering record high of 7.3 % on wednesday morning ; by contrast , the bond yield for @entity147 -- a relatively healthy economy -- closed at 1.8 % on tuesday night			1
@entity5 will already have to borrow at least â ‚ ¬ 300 billion -- nearly the total @entity13 owes to lenders -- next year alone to pay off maturing debts , and the worry is that the skyrocketing interest rates on @entity5 bonds may soon make it too expensive for the country to continue borrowing money			0
why are @entity5 's bond yields so high ? bond yields are driven by confidence and based on supply and demand			1
the more confident investors are in the health of the @entity5 economy , the more government bonds , or sovereign debt , the investors will buy			0
the more bonds that are being bought , the lower the rates will be on the bonds -- meaning @entity5 can borrow money to pay its bills at relatively cheap rates			0
when confidence in an economy drops , however , fewer investors are willing to invest money in that country 's bonds , which is precisely what has happened in @entity5			1
@entity5 's bonds are unattractive to investors because there are fears about the country 's ability to pay off long - term debt based on current economic projections			1
why is a 7 % yield considered the point of no return ? @entity13 , @entity190 and @entity191 were all forced to seek bailouts once their bond yields surpassed and remained above the 7 % mark for an extended period of time			1
while there is nothing about the 7 % figure that automatically triggers a bailout -- something that would be impossible in @entity5 's case anyway , as @entity2 simply can not afford to bail out the country -- experts do see the rate as difficult to overcome			1
@entity13 , @entity190 and @entity191 all needed bailouts within two months of their bond yields breaching and then remaining above 7 %			1
the recent high yields are particularly concerning because the @entity209 has been buying @entity5 bonds since the start of august in an effort to create a sort of false demand , which would then drive the rate down to a manageable level			0
that has not worked , but it could be a lot worse had the @entity209 not taken the action at all			0
how can @entity5 get out of this mess ? @entity5 will default on its debt if it does n't figure out a way to get its bond yields down to a manageable level			1
the yields wo n't budge until @entity5 lawmakers take concrete steps to reassure international lenders that the country is a safe bet			2
" @entity5 will not be out of the heat of bond markets until a solid and stable government actually implements austerity and undertakes reforms with strong credible leadership , " said @entity232 , head of sovereign risk at @entity234			0
even if they pass these the austerity proposals , some economists fear @entity5 will still drown in debt if it does n't develop more drastic measures			2
the @entity209 should also increase its purchasing of @entity5 bonds in order to make it cheaper for @entity5 to raise money , according to @entity250 , an economist at the @entity251			0
" unless yields on those bonds fall to @entity147 levels , there is no way that @entity5 's debt arithmetic can be made to add up , " he wrote			1
how would an @entity5 default affect the world ? a default by @entity5 , the world 's eight - largest economy with the world 's fourth - largest stock of outstanding government bonds , could have a disastrous effect on many @entity2 banks and global markets , experts say			2
@entity2 banks , particularly those in @entity147 and @entity272 , are the largest holders of @entity5 debt and would be hit the hardest by a default			2
a default would also wreak havoc on already - shaky global markets and could dash any hopes of economic growth in @entity2 for the foreseeable future			0
as concerns continue to grow around @entity5 , the head of the @entity282 painted a stark picture of the challenges facing the world 's economic stability			0
" the global economy has entered a dangerous and uncertain phase , " @entity288 said in remarks prepared for a speech at the @entity291 in @entity292			0
" if we do not act , and act together , we could enter a downward spiral of uncertainty , financial instability and a collapse in global demand			0
" " ultimately , we could face a lost decade of low growth and high unemployment , " she said			0
@entity0 's @entity305 , @entity306 and @entity307 contributed to this report .			0

@entity5 's bond yields have passed the dangerous 7 % *threshold*
bond yields represent investor confidence in a country 's ability to repay its debt
prime minister @entity4 announced he will resign following the passage of austerity measures
with a debt pile of nearly 2 trillion euros , @entity5 is seen as too big for @entity2 to bail out
