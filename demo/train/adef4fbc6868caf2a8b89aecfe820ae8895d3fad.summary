-- you got to give the people , now give the people what they want -- the @entity5 now that @entity7 have control of both houses of @entity10 , they are going to have to do better -- and do right by all @entity12 , not just their fringe conservative base			1
in the first days of the newly minted 112th @entity10 , after the 2010 midterms gave @entity7 control of the @entity16 , the @entity12 people were clamoring for action on jobs and the economy			1
what did the new @entity7 @entity16 give them ? one of the first laws introduced was the @entity22			1
whereas existing federal law already limited the use of government funds to pay for abortion , there were exceptions for incest and rape			2
the @entity22 attempted to narrow the definition of rape to only involving force			2
@entity34 house speaker @entity34 called the legislation a top priority for his caucus			2
maybe for conservative @entity7 but certainly not for most @entity12 , especially when unemployment was 9 % and the economy was still reeling from the @entity40			1
then , as now , @entity12 say the economy is the most important problem facing the country			2
even all the fear and fear - mongering around @entity45 and @entity46 has n't changed this			0
people are far more worried about the economy and the job market			2
abortion barely registers as a concern in the polls			0
meanwhile , @entity7 have touted a list of " more than 30 jobs bills " they have passed in the @entity16 but have failed in the @entity57 @entity56			1
the party has even printed the list on handy flash cards so that the likes of @entity34 can carry them in their pockets and wave around at political events			0
but those so - called " jobs bills " include repealing @entity64 , gutting clean air and water regulations , and weakening the @entity67			0
in other words , they 're not really jobs bills but simply fig leaves for conservatives ' long - standing ideological agenda			0
economists say the actual job growth impact of the @entity7 agenda is next to zero -- not to mention the harm it will do to working @entity12 who rely on wage standards and protections , or the 10 million - plus @entity12 who have gained health insurance through @entity64			1
when @entity7 controlled just one house of @entity10 , they perpetually and annoyingly passed symbolic pet legislation that stood no chance of becoming law			1
now that @entity7 control both houses , that behavior wo n't just be irritating but downright irresponsible			1
the @entity12 people have entrusted republicans with control of @entity10			1
they expect @entity10 to lead , not continue to throw partisan temper tantrums			1
leading , in this context , means passing laws that solve real problems and are in forms that both parties agree on			0
no more orwellian circus shows			0
for six years , @entity7 have condemned president @entity99 and the @entity57 agenda			1
regardless of how the midterm results panned out due to a handful of races in red and maroon - ish purple states , the fact remains that the @entity57 agenda is broadly and strongly supported			0
most @entity12 support extending unemployment benefits , passing paid sick leave , lowering student loan rates and raising the minimum wage , as was reflected in ballot measure results across the country tuesday			0
it 's why many of the @entity7 who won their races actually ran as rhetorical liberals , trying to mask their unpopular stances on women 's issues and more			1
going into this election , while only 23 % of @entity12 have a " very positive " view of @entity99 and just 12 % view the @entity57 very positively , the favorability percentage for the @entity7 is even lower -- just 7 % , according to one survey			2
not exactly time to spike the football			0
of course , no party should govern based solely on popular referendum			0
but governing without any concern for what the people want is insane			0
seven in 10 @entity12 oppose limiting access to abortion , according to a recent poll			0
so why is it that in the past three years , state legislatures have passed more anti-abortion measures than in the entire previous decade ? the new @entity7 leadership in @entity10 should focus on issues such as rebuilding our crumbling bridges and other public infrastructure , or passing bipartisan immigration reform to help level wages and working standards for everyone in @entity12			1
maybe there are even reasonable compromises to be found in reforming the tax code , making it simpler and more transparent while at the same time fairer			0
either way , the @entity7 should stop shutting down the government and blocking the president 's appointments			1
sure , the @entity12 people blame both parties for gridlock			0
but when asked , they place more blame with @entity7			2
now that they have full power in @entity10 either to compromise or not with the @entity158 , @entity7 have no more excuses			1
and if republicans do n't start learning how to lead in a responsible , bipartisan fashion , the @entity12 people will have no more patience			2
in 1975 when the @entity5 sang " @entity163 , " they sang about the people wanting " better education now " and " better food to eat " and " better homing " ( by which i assume they meant housing , not pigeons )			0
the @entity5 were singing about the real world -- real people and problems that political leaders should be addressing			0
@entity7 have to stop singing their tired tune of " @entity177 president @entity176 " and instead starting singing harmony with the @entity57 to get things done in @entity180 and , yes , " @entity163			1
" we have real problems in @entity12 that need real solutions and real leaders doing the hard work of governing together			0
here 's hoping @entity7 are up to the task to which they 've been elected .			1

@entity188 : now that the @entity7 has control of @entity10 , it needs to do a better job
@entity188 : republicans must go beyond their fringe conservative base and ideologies
crumbling infrastructure , immigration , good wages are issues that matter , she says
@entity188 : @entity7 should stop shutting down the government and show it 's up to task at hand
