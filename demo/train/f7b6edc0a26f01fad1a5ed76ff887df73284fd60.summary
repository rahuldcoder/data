-- everything looked perfectly normal as the plane prepared to land			2
i fastened my seat belt and looked through the window , watching the toy cars on the highway below gradually grow to life - size , and the airport runway rapidly -- too rapidly , perhaps -- move almost within arms ' reach			2
the plane touched down , barreled ahead on the tarmac for a couple of seconds , and suddenly raised its nose and roared back up to the sky pressing us against our seat backs while climbing at a frighteningly steep angle			2
what happened , we wondered wordlessly			2
what 's coming next ? what came next was an anxious circling back to the airport followed by a smooth landing and not much of an explanation about what had gone wrong			1
by then , our heartbeats had mostly returned to normal			2
the story did not end the same way for passengers of @entity32 , which crashed on landing in @entity34 last weekend , leaving two young women dead and scores injured			1
the @entity38 disaster continues to rivet our attention			0
we want to know exactly what went wrong			0
but that 's not only because it was a terrible tragedy for many families			0
it 's that air flight commands so much interest			1
the @entity34 disaster is receiving much more attention , for example , than the horrifying runaway train crash in @entity51 that razed a town and killed at least 15 people , with another 45 still missing			0
we give far more attention to plane crashes that kill a small number of people than to , say , car fatalities , which killed more than 32,000 people in the @entity60 alone last year			1
each death is devastating and should be mourned , but our attention , in proportion to the risk and the death " tool " is much greater when it comes to flying			1
the experts have told us the statistics			0
flying is almost perfectly safe			1
even when disaster does occur , as with this weekend 's flight , the numbers are extraordinary			1
more than 99.3 % of the 307 people on board the @entity38 flight survived			1
it 's much more dangerous to do almost anything , the statistics tell us , than to fly			1
billions of people fly every year and almost zero percent of them die in the process			0
the risk is comparable , we 're told , to that of dying from a ceiling collapse at a grocery store			0
and yet , the reassuring statistics penetrate our collective fears as slowly as a worn drill bit cutting into stone			0
flying remains a surreal , magical experience , but one that -- even among those who will adamantly deny it -- is framed by a twinge of irrational fear			1
the experience of climbing on an airplane and watching it defy gravity , break through the clouds and glide across the sky remains a barely comprehensible human achievement ; it feels like a challenge against the laws of nature			0
@entity70 has a powerful emotional hold on us			0
there is something sublime about humans looking down upon the clouds			0
but the experience also packs the truth about our mortality more transparently than almost anything we do			0
when we are sitting in that cargo - packed aluminum tube , mocking the earth 's pull , the thought that something could go badly wrong tends to sneak into our consciousness			0
a spell of strong turbulence can sharply shift the collective mood on board , no matter what the statistics			0
it 's no wonder some people refuse to fly without a strong infusion of thought - quieting alcohol			0
it is that outsized emotional power of flight that makes plane crashes or news about near misses compel our attention , even when the casualties remain ( fingers crossed ! ) so remarkably low			1
there is , of course , a grave downside to the exalted place on which we keep our fear of air disaster			1
there is a reason terrorists have so often used flights as the means to inflict terror			0
they know we pay attention , they know we are primed for fear			1
not surprisingly , such a powerful primal response comes with a price tag			2
as a society , we spend enormous sums and we endure endless discomfort trying to do everything we can to make flying safe , or at least to make many of us feel as though we 've made it safe			1
the 9/11 attackers , who used passenger aircrafts as weapons produced such a strong reaction that they drastically changed the flying experience and the cost of flying			1
some put the total 9/11 tally at trillions , most of it from @entity60 's intense reaction to the hit			1
the @entity176 spends $ 8 billion per year shepherding us through endless security lines			2
we obediently stand in the queue , adding countless hours and enormous inconvenience , hoping it all amounts to more than security theatre			0
in the aftermath of my aborted landing , i spent hours trying to dig out the facts of what had occurred , as i have done after other , much scarier flying experiences involving engine failures , jammed landing gears and blown tires			1
anyone who has traveled extensively , particularly in remote parts of the world , has a few stories to tell about airborne misadventures			0
first i asked a flight attendant what happened when i was leaving the plane			2
she said there was " probably " something blocking the runway on our first landing attempt			2
i looked up the public records of flight incidents and was surprised to find no sign of my obviously not routine incident			1
i called the airline and was told , much to my surprise , that these kinds of " @entity212 " and " go around " incidents are quite routine , barely meriting a note in the log , and that there was probably another aircraft on the runway , perhaps an air traffic controller mistake			2
then i called the @entity219			0
the @entity219 said their logs showed no sign that such a thing had occurred			0
i called the airline again , pointing to the @entity219 's denial of their story			0
after much insistence and many phone calls and emails i was finally told it was the pilot who " was not comfortable " with the landing he was executing			2
@entity70 , it seems , will never be completely predictable or 100 % incident free			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity237 .			1

@entity237 once on flight that made aborted landing , then landed safely
she says fatalities rare but air travel draws primal fear that dangerous travel modes do *n't*
she says 9/11 drastically changed the cost of flying ; @entity60 spends *lavishly* on air safety
@entity251 : while relatively safe , will never be completely predictable or 100 % incident free
