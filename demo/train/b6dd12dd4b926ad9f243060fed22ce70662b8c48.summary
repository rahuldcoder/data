-- i gaze up at the flourescent strip lighting in the surgeon 's office , willing the @entity5 on my @entity6 to keen even louder for @entity7 to " come out to play			2
" i need them to drown out the sound of hypodermic needles being stripped from their wrappers , to out - sing the crisp clack of some giant stapler - like thingy being readied to pierce flesh			2
i begin to make deals with @entity18 : if it 's benign , i 'll sponsor an @entity22 schoolgirl 's education			1
if it 's benign , i 'll help @entity24 really nail her multiplication tables			2
i 'll call my mother more , do more dishes , compost for our nonexistent garden			2
@entity0 : not - so - perfect marriage that makes us believe in love biopsies are recent inventions , but negotiating with @entity18 must be among man 's most ancient ones			1
of course , my prebiopsy bargaining was just pleading in disguise : faux brokering between the entirely powerless -- a supine woman , clinging to the paper strip down the middle of a doctor 's examining table -- and the all - powerful , whether one calls it @entity18 , the @entity47 , or " the luck of the draw			1
" to cut a real deal , both parties need some power			2
gangsters and parents both know this well			2
when @entity57 , as @entity58 , promises to make someone " an offer he ca n't refuse , " it 's a bargain struck at gunpoint , another deal - that 's - not - one			2
as a mother , i 've used this thuggish tactic more than i 'd like to admit			2
" that 's the deal " is a common slogan in our home			2
when my husband or i use it , our daughters know they 've reached a red line , not to be crossed			2
that gerbil cage needs cleaning			2
@entity77 was , women cut far fewer deals than they do today			1
in the past , when they remained dependent on their fathers or husbands , their lives were less about striking deals than hoping for the best			1
fairy princesses -- those perfect models of traditional passivity -- do n't cut deals			1
whether they 're sweeping floors while their sisters swan off to the ball or marrying the prince , both drudgery and love fall on them from great heights			1
deals do n't happen in dictatorships , where , let 's face it , most of those princesses live			1
@entity0 : master the art of making a deal real live women negotiate			2
over the past century , we got the vote , the pill , washer - dryers , and antidiscrimination laws , giving us choices , freedoms -- and the ability to strike any number of deals			1
nowhere is this more true than in the arena of relationships : in november 2009 , the @entity120 revealed in the @entity121 that their own partnership is a series of negotiations , a deft balance between his political ambitions and her own professional and familial ones			2
when @entity131 said that the equality of a union " is measured over the scope of the marriage ; it 's not just four years or eight years or two , " it seemed clear that the post- - @entity138 era could very much be hers			1
their bald acknowledgment of the brokering involved in their marriage was n't a sign of two lawyers at work but two equals in love			1
@entity0 : 3 tricks for a happier marriage to be sure , the traditional blueprint for " marrying well " -- her beauty , his paycheck -- still proves popular			1
in my leafy @entity158 neighborhood , i know women who have made such deals			1
they often seem calmer than i am , and they 're inevitably sleeker , with taut skin and trainer - honed bodies			0
many of their husbands leave the house before dawn to catch the @entity169 markets when they open , returning home late , ruffling their kids ' hair while they sleep			0
these women vacation on small and exquisite islands , but they 're never sure when they 'll reach them , as they are tethered to their husbands ' timetables			0
@entity0 : confessions of a semi-happy wife when i met the man i was to marry , he certainly did n't seem like a deal			1
lacking height , a hearty handshake , and career ambitions , he did n't conform to the traditional notions of a catch			0
@entity192 was a slight , suburban - born @entity193 , a dead ringer for @entity195 in @entity196			0
when we met , he was languidly pursuing a history doctorate , but his keenest aspiration was really to reread @entity200 -- for the umpteenth time -- and see as many movies as possible			0
his vast stores of warmth took time to find , guarded as they were by those twin emotional weapons favored by the @entity208 male , irony and reserve			0
i spent a weekend parsing a document that turned out to be a love letter but which i 'd thought was some sort of philosophy essay laced with liner notes from a @entity217 album			1
he was low - key , this @entity192			0
while i suggested we move -- to @entity219 , @entity220 , anywhere , really , for an adventure -- he was happy to stay in his hometown , @entity158 , and to abandon his doctorate for a quiet job in the @entity208 civil service			1
once i fell for him , i knew i 'd have to plan on a life outside the @entity229			1
it was n't just his job that was strictly @entity208			0
his character was , too			0
i knew that it would n't be easy to make the switch from his calm , structured life to the cut - and - thrust of the @entity229 job marketplace			1
in the land of @entity241 , nobody would have the patience to wait for @entity244 's brilliance to shine through his self - effacing manner			0
sometimes i 'm stupid enough to think we should make a more conventional deal			0
during the boom , with millions making millions , my husband remained content with his modest take - home pay			0
" you 're smart , " i 'd occasionally nag			0
" why not be a banker and make us rich ? " his reply was succinct : " nine weeks of vacation , and job security			0
" in my heart , i knew they were both key to my own treasured freedoms : to travel , and to freelance			0
and when the financial market crashed , and for sale signs blossomed in @entity158 's bankers ' neighborhoods , i was reminded once again of his wisdom and my foolishness			1
@entity0 : 7 deals you should never make his ambitions were tame -- except those he had for me			1
when i got a chance to leave @entity158 to study in @entity219 , he said , " go			1
" once there , when i was offered a @entity277 - based magazine job , he was hardheaded : " stay			0
" when the chance for a summer in @entity280 came up , he said , " go			0
" even now , 15 years on , married , with two children , he still wants me to keep going			0
the other week , as i planned a few days in @entity282 for a story , he was busy arguing that i should tack on a short hop to @entity285			0
" go , " he urged			0
" " are you trying to get me killed ? " i teased him			0
no , he just knew a few days there would help me with a book i 'm writing			1
i did n't go , fretting i 'd miss home too much			0
that panicked him , for he worries i 'll get so enmeshed in our family that i wo n't do the two other things i love to do : write and report			1
" i want you to stay the woman i married , " he 'll murmur			1
" you need to hit the road again			0
" these urgings , of course , only make me want to stay			0
that said , i know that even if love lasts , deals do n't			1
to stay married we 'll doubtless have to broker new deals , and newer ones after that ... till death do us part			1
making deals with @entity18 may be a nonstarter			2
done right , making deals with your spouse never ends			1
