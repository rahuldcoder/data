-- whether you 're pleased or peeved by @entity4 's pick for running mate , @entity6 rep. @entity5 , there 's no denying that the politician is a model of good health			1
a former personal trainer , @entity5 , who stands 6 feet , 2 inches , and weighs 163 pounds with 6 % -8 % body fat , works out like a warrior and leads fellow @entity14 staffers in daily morning sessions of the popular 90 - day , body - sculpting program called @entity17			1
" i 'm kind of a workout guy			2
i 've always been into it			2
[ former mich. rep. ] @entity20 and i lead [ @entity17 classes ] — there 's about a dozen of us that do it , " @entity5 told @entity19			1
" it works because it hits your body in many different ways : pull - ups , sit - ups , lots of cardio , karate , jump training , yoga			1
it pushes your body ... and gets you out of your plateau			1
" @entity0 : we tried the @entity41 workout even @entity5 's critics , including @entity44 political reporter @entity43 , acknowledge that the @entity46 's personal health priorities are in the right place : " it can only do us good as a nation to have as a role model such a fine physical specimen in high office			1
hopefully , @entity5 will inspire more @entity53 to get healthy			1
that 's important , because if @entity5 succeeds in ending @entity56 , they wo n't be able to afford getting sick			1
" @entity5 is n't the only fan of @entity17 , by far			1
the standard home fitness package by @entity59 costs $ 119.85 and has sold more than 3.5 million copies since 2005			1
what do you get in the box ? twelve workout dvds , a 100 - page fitness guide , a nutrition plan and a 90 - day calendar to track your progress			1
workouts include a range of exercises — including chest and back strengthening , plyometrics and yoga — designed to create " muscle confusion , " a cross-training regimen that 's supposed to keep the body from adapting to the same exercise over time and prevent plateaus			1
@entity0 : it 's not too late to starting training for a distance run we talked with @entity17 creator @entity85 , who leads occasional sessions with @entity87			1
think you can hack it ? @entity17 's core training technique relies on " muscle confusion , " which @entity5 credits for its success			1
can you explain what that is ? muscle confusion is a variety of exercises			2
typically a lot of programs focus purely on stationary yoga , pilates , weight training or cardiovascular — @entity17 has all those things			1
the main purpose is to avoid the three things that cause most people to stop exercising : boredom , injuries and plateaus			2
in @entity17 , there 's variety in fitness with muscle confusion , and the goal is for people to get through the whole 90 days so they have real success and real results			1
@entity0 : we tried the @entity121 who gets the most out of @entity17 ? when we created it , we made it for two categories of people			1
we had a big contingency of @entity128 [ another @entity85 workout system ] customers that it helped quite a bit , and we were trying to get people out of the gym who were n't getting results			2
but it 's turned out to be a workout for the military			2
i 'm touring five military bases in two weeks because they 're using it as well			2
it 's [ also ] turned out to be a workout for the clinically obese — i 've met dozens and dozens of people who are obese and used this program			2
one of the reasons this works is that there are dozens of modifications other programs do n't have			2
it 's become much bigger than we ever anticipated			2
what can users expect during the 90 - day regimen ? it 's broken up into cycles			2
each month there is a different sequence of exercises [ each laid out in the @entity164 ]			2
the first three weeks you do the basic exercises we tell you , and then you have one recovery week			2
the second month you get a whole new bunch of routines done in different sequences and the recovery week again			2
remember recovery does n't mean you do n't do anything ; recovery means you are still working hard			0
[ that is , you 're still working out , but not quite as rigorously as during the first three weeks of the month			0
] in the final month , you do a combination of what you did in the first and second month , which is an extension of muscle confusion			0
@entity0 : how your @entity182 can help you run faster and harder what equipment is needed besides the dvds ? in a majority of the exercises the only thing required is the human body , @entity189 and sir @entity191 's law of gravity			1
but having a pull - up bar helps			0
you do n't need it , but it certainly enhances the program , as well as dumbbells and bands			0
some people just use resistance bands , but some men who want more size will go out and get dumbbells			0
what if i do n't want bulging muscles like the buff people in your infomercials ? there are three ways you can go through the program			0
there 's the classic version , which is the basic way we designed it			0
but we also created a lean version , which focuses more on flexibility , range of motion and cardiovascular fitness			1
there 's another version for athletes called doubles , which they 're doing twice a day			0
... you can customize the 90 days based on what you need			0
@entity0 : 5 common mistakes you 're making at the gym how important is diet when you 're on the @entity17 system ? it 's about the food as well			1
i 've just launched @entity233 , which delivers weekly meals to customers			0
often the reason so many people in this country struggle is because they are putting the wrong things in their mouths			0
there 's too much fat , sugar , salt and chemicals coming out of plastic bags and cans and i 'm trying to get people to eat whole foods			1
eat [ foods ] that when you look down at your plate , you can pronounce them			0
the eating program has great recipes and a diet program that says , ' hey look , you can eat beef , you can eat vegetarian , you can eat @entity258			0
' just eat the way you 're great grandparents ate , and you 'll be better off			0
why do you think @entity17 has become so popular ? i think there are three reasons really			1
i think no. 1 is obviously muscle confusion			0
no. 2 is the modifications built into the program for anybody , whether you have a prosthetic leg or you have 200 pounds to lose			1
the little black dress of fitness people tell me that i deliver fitness in a way that 's a bit different than others			1
i use a lot of humor and silliness			0
everyone in the program has nicknames and i do a terrible @entity282 impression			0
i make something that is vital for people to change their health and wellness and i 've delivered it in a way that is powerful for people			0
it 's fun and we do n't treat it like rocket science and i 'm not the drill sergeant personality			0
i 'm the kid with two left feet who was picked last for every sport but dodge ball , so i understand the trials and tribulations of getting fit from my own personal experience — it was not an easy process for me			0
i 'm trying to make it easy and fun , and i think that 's why it 's done well			0
how often do you make it to @entity306 to workout with @entity14 staffers like @entity5 ? i 've been in the @entity310 gym about five or six times with @entity5 , @entity312 [ @entity313 ] , @entity314 [ @entity315 ] , @entity316 [ @entity317 ]			1
... it 's usually anywhere between eight and 20 congressmen [ in a session ]			0
it 's turned out to be about once every eight months or twice a year			0
@entity0 : the best runners ' playlists on @entity326 's @entity325 politicians are as busy as the rest of us			0
is @entity17 doable with an already packed schedule ? it 's an hour a day			1
a lot of people would say no. ... [ but ] people find time to fit it in because they see that it works			0
a lot of people have friends and family and coworkers and neighbors that look different , that act different , that feel different , that have more energy , that sleep better , that are off their meds [ because of @entity17 ]			1
we can put the before - and - after pictures in the infomercial — and these are real people who submit their photos to us — but when it 's people you know in your life and you see how different they are , how much happier they are , how much more fit they are — that 's the selling point			0
it 's pretty much word of mouth now at this point			0
i 'm trying to change the way people look at [ fitness ]			2
it can be a fun process and it can be permanent			0
