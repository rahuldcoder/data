-- @entity2 's billion - dollar purchase of @entity3 this week may have been the first time that many @entity5 heard of the tech - world darling , which lets users turn their phone photos into sleek - looking , stylized images with a single touch			1
the acquisition shined a light on what 's emerging as a nearly incontrovertible truth in tech circles : @entity16 is the future of photography and the tools used to enhance and share phone - generated images have value that is only expected to climb			1
@entity3 is n't the only player in that field , but it had quickly become its all - star			2
barely a year - and - a - half old , @entity3 had already racked up 30 million users on @entity27 's mobile system before opening up to @entity29 users last week			1
another 5 million signed up in less than a week , setting the table for @entity2 to gobble up what until monday was emerging as its prime competitor in mobile photo - sharing			1
some early adopters complained that @entity2 snatching up their favorite app takes some of the indie shine off of it			2
but there 's no question that , by putting the tool in front of its hundreds of millions of users , @entity2 could amp up what 's already a quickly emerging sector of the mobile landscape			1
( for reference , witness what happened with music streaming when @entity2 and @entity50 signed an exclusive sharing deal )			2
the appeal of @entity3 and similar apps does n't take much work to suss out : with minimal effort , they let pedestrian photographers share enhanced images with their friends			1
" the strength of @entity3 is in its simplicity , " said @entity60 , founder and editor of @entity62 , a photography resource blog			2
" a few clicks and you have a once average image that now looks amazing and can be easily shared with your friends			0
" view featured comments , photos from readers @entity3 , he said , " recognized a space that needed to be filled , and they filled it ... mix in some luck and there you go , a billion - dollar acquisition			1
" while the @entity3 is the richest and most high - profile example , other web bigwigs have clearly recognized that mobile is the future of photography			1
in 2010 ( an eon ago in @entity89 years ) , @entity87 led the charge by buying @entity91 , one of the first sites to combine cool photo - editing tools with cloud computer storage			0
and last month , @entity96 ( which had its own billion - dollar deal this week ) bought @entity98 -- an app that lets user create postcards out of their photos			0
@entity3 's rapid growth -- it 's more than doubled its user base in the past five months -- is just the latest evidence of the explosion of online and mobile photo sharing			1
in less than two years the app has already hosted more than 500 million images -- more than 30 times greater than the entire photo archive of the @entity112			1
that sounds like a lot until you realize that @entity2 users have uploaded more than 170 billion photos to the social network , making it the single largest host of images on the @entity89 , according to statistics cited during a panel last month during the @entity125 conference			1
photographers on that panel , which included @entity3 co-founder @entity128 , said the mobile - photography craze is important , even if it sometimes leads mundane , amateurish images flooding your social networks			1
" having 100 million more photos in the world is n't doing anybody any harm , " said @entity132 , assistant professor of new media at the @entity134			0
" it has value no matter what			0
" @entity60 , of @entity62 , agrees , and says mobile photography is likely to remain on the rise at technology improves			0
" i think this purchase sends a signal that mobile photography is more relevant than ever , " he said			0
" mobile photography is already overtaking the point - and - shoot market			0
i think this has been obvious for some time			0
but soon they will begin to really encroach on the ( digital camera ) market , as well			0
as the technology gets better , people might be more inclined to put their ' pro ' camera in their pocket instead of purchasing one they need a backpack for			0
" @entity3 is known for producing artful , filter - laden photos that would not look out of place hanging in an art gallery			2
but @entity128 believes the most meaningful images on his network are n't necessarily the ones taken by professional photographers			0
he cited people in the @entity167 who used @entity3 earlier this year to document damage caused by tornadoes			2
" how can we get the most important images out there -- not necessarily the most socially pleasing ? " he said at the @entity125 panel , suggesting that @entity3 in the future might highlight curated photos , not just the ones with the most " likes			2
" " how do we sift through that [ all the images on @entity3 ] and present for you the most interesting and most meaningful photos ? that 's our challenge for the next few years			1
" " my hope is that people feel at home on @entity3 by posting just about anything , " @entity128 added			0
" on @entity3 , taking photos really helps you see the world around you in a whole new way			2
" while @entity3 has clearly rocketed to the top of the pack in a short time , a rising tide has lifted the ships of other mobile apps as well			1
those efforts stand to benefit from the increased attention the @entity3 buyout will bring , as well as any @entity3 users who may peel off as a sort of nose - thumbing at @entity2 , the 800 - pound gorilla of the social networking world			1
they include : @entity206 : adds animation			0
with @entity206 , users are invited to shoot a few seconds of video with their phones			2
then , by selecting a few images from their videos , they can create what appear to be animated photographs			0
we 're pretty sure this is how they did it at @entity219			0
@entity220 : in a way , @entity220 is the anti-instagram			0
users are encouraged to post plain , simple photos that communicate for them -- which is why the app has been called " @entity226 for pictures			1
" like @entity226 , photos are grouped together under trending topics , letting users share with strangers as well as friends			0
@entity233 : if @entity3 is a way to push your fancy , filtered photos to sites like @entity2 and @entity226 , @entity233 lets you take photos already on those sites , fancy them up and share with other users of the app. @entity243 : a precursor to @entity3 , @entity243 was probably the first way people started seeing grainy , old - fashioned photos popping up in their @entity2 and @entity226 feeds			1
instead of instantly applying a filter , @entity243 lets users modify their photos through a series of tweaks to get just the right classic look			1
@entity0 's @entity254 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 's @entity3 purchase shines light on emerging mobile photo market

photogs say the appeal is in making simple photos look fancy with little effort
apps like @entity206 , @entity220 , @entity233 and @entity243 also stand to gain
