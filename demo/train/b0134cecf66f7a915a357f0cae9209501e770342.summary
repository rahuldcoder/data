@entity0 -- @entity2 ordered the expulsion of @entity5 's ambassador and other senior diplomats stationed there on friday , a dramatic slap against its one - time close ally over its failure to apologize for a deadly raid last year on a @entity12 - bound ship in a flotilla loaded with humanitarian aid			1
low - level officials are allowed to stay , but others must leave by wednesday , a @entity2 official said			1
@entity2 has been incensed with @entity5 after its commandos clashed with @entity2 on one of the flotilla ships , the @entity21 , and killed nine people			1
this comes on the same day that @entity24 released a report about the may 2010 raid			1
the document criticized @entity5 's actions in the incident , even as it describes the @entity5 naval blockade of @entity12 as a " legitimate security measure			1
" secretary - general ban ki - moon received a copy of the report on friday , a @entity24 spokesman said			1
@entity36 , deputy spokesman for @entity37 , said the secretary - general regretted that the report did not bridge the gap between @entity2 and @entity5			1
@entity41 , spokeswoman for the @entity42 , echoed that sentiment			0
" we hope they will continue to look for opportunities to improve their long - standing relationship , and we will encourage both to work towards that end , " she said			0
@entity5 expressed its sorrow at the loss of life , but said it " will not apologize for its soldiers taking action to defend their lives			1
as any other state , @entity5 has the right to defend its civilians and soldiers			2
" @entity5 's blockade of @entity12 is designed to prevent weapons from being smuggled to the territory , which is controlled by the @entity63 group @entity62			1
@entity12 - based militants have been firing rockets into southern @entity5 and @entity5 has responded with military might			1
but @entity2 has been strongly opposed to the jewish state 's naval blockade of the @entity70 territory of @entity12 because , an official said , @entity70 have suffered from the action and other @entity5 policies in the densely - populated region			1
" it is about time for the @entity5 government to face the consequences of its illegitimate actions since it sees itself above international law and ignores human conscience and must pay a price , " foreign minister @entity75 said friday			2
" this price will be , above all , the loss of @entity2 's friendship			2
" @entity2 has been @entity5 's closest and steadiest @entity87 ally since the jewish state was founded			1
the relationship has had political , economic and military components , and both countries have been stalwart @entity93 allies during the @entity94 and over the subsequent decades			0
in fact , trade has grown from 2008 to 2010 , according to @entity2 's economy ministry 's website			2
@entity2 's imports from @entity5 totaled $ 842 million from january to july in 2010 and $ 1.1 billion during the same period in 2011			1
@entity2 's january to july exports to @entity5 was $ 1.1 billion in 2010 and $ 1.3 billion in 2011			1
but ties between the nations have deteriorated during the administration of @entity2 prime minister @entity104 -- long critical of @entity5 's policies in @entity12			1
@entity75 said military agreements have been suspended			0
but a senior @entity2 official said that existing contracts must be honored " no matter what " and " we have n't touched upon intelligence sharing			2
" @entity5 and @entity2 have long had a close military relationship , but there have been no joint exercises for more than a year and a half amid tensions between both sides			1
the two countries have been negotiating for months in an attempt to improve their faltering relationship , but those efforts have failed			0
the release of the report was delayed while those negotiations continued			0
" we 've waited and waited , " the senior @entity2 official told @entity1			0
" there was almost an agreement that @entity127 agreed upon ... they 're just wasting our time			0
" he was referring to @entity5 prime minister @entity127			0
" this makes it official			0
before it was de facto , there was nothing going on , but definitely there was contact , " said the official , who asked not to be named because of diplomatic protocol			0
one analyst said , " @entity2 has been warning @entity5 for months that it would do this and @entity5 chose to ignore it			1
" @entity143 , senior @entity2 analyst with the @entity144 , argued that @entity2 made a concession earlier this year , by preventing the @entity21 from leading a second proposed blockade - busting flotilla to @entity12			1
@entity143 said @entity2 's stance on @entity5 could be risky in its relationship with the @entity150			1
but the country -- while critical of @entity5 and friendly with @entity152 , @entity5 's arch - enemy -- has been firmly in the @entity93 camp lately			2
" at the moment , the @entity150 seems to appreciate @entity2 's role in the region , " he said			1
@entity2 has been an integral player in the allies ' efforts in @entity160 and in @entity161			0
also , its foreign ministry has confirmed to @entity1 that @entity2 agreed " in principle " to place a @entity164 long - range radar system on @entity2 territory			2
" @entity2 's hosting of this element will constitute its contribution to the defense system that was developed within the new strategic concept of @entity164			2
it will strengthen the defense capacity of @entity164 and our national defense system , " the foreign ministry said			0
in contrast with @entity2 's official view , the @entity24 report on the flotilla incident said that @entity5 's naval blockade of @entity12 was a " legitimate security measure in order to prevent weapons from entering @entity12 by sea			1
" but it criticized @entity5 's actions on the ship , saying its " decision to board the vessels with such substantial force at a great distance from the blockade zone and with no final warning immediately prior to the boarding was excessive and unreasonable			0
" " non-violent options should have been used in the first instance			0
in particular , clear prior warning that the vessels were to be boarded and a demonstration of dissuading force should have been given to avoid the type of confrontation that occurred			0
the operation should have reassessed its options when the resistance to the initial boarding attempt became apparent , " the report said			0
the report said the " loss of life and injuries resulting from the use of force by @entity5 forces " during the vessel 's takeover " was unacceptable			2
" it said " no satisfactory explanation " had been provided for the deaths			0
" forensic evidence showing that most of the deceased were shot multiple times , including in the back , or at close range has not been adequately accounted for in the material presented by @entity5			0
" the report said there was " significant mistreatment of passengers " by @entity5 authorities			2
that took place from the takeover through deportation			0
" this included physical mistreatment , harassment and intimidation , unjustified confiscation of belongings and the denial of timely consular assistance			0
" the report said " the flotilla acted recklessly in attempting to breach the naval blockade , " adding that actions of the flotilla needlessly carried the potential of escalation			2
it said most flotilla participants " had no violent intentions , " but there were questions about the objectives of the flotilla organizers , particularly the @entity2 non-government organization , @entity251			2
" @entity254 personnel faced significant , organized and violent resistance from a group of passengers when they boarded the @entity21 requiring them to use force for their own protection			0
three soldiers were captured , mistreated , and placed at risk by those passengers			0
" @entity75 made reference to the @entity24 report on friday , saying it underscores @entity2 's position that crimes were committed by @entity5 troops on the ship			1
however , he disagreed with the stance that the @entity5 blockade is legal			0
the senior @entity2 official said the @entity24 report is political			1
the report is called the @entity279 report , named after the chair of the panel of inquiry into the incident , sir @entity279			0
" we do n't recognize the so - called blockade out of @entity12			1
and we leave it at that , " the senior official said			0
" we will try to pass some kind of resolution or decision saying it 's not legal			0
" he said @entity2 is willing to help any legal challenges to the blockade			0
the @entity5 government accepted the report -- with reservations			2
it said the decision to board the vessels was not excessive and unreasonable , claiming its troops gave repeated warnings to the ships , @entity127 's office said in a statement			0
@entity5 soldiers ' lives were in immediate danger from passengers who carried metal bars , slingshots and chains			2
several @entity5 soldiers were wounded in the incident			2
" given these circumstances , @entity5 's soldiers clearly acted in self - defense and responded reasonably , proportionally and with restraint , including the use of less - lethal weapons where feasible , " the @entity5 leader 's office said			1
an @entity5 official emphasized that the report not only confirms the blockade 's legality , it states there was no humanitarian problem in @entity12			1
the official added that anyone who wished to send humanitarian aid to @entity12 needs to do it in coordination with @entity5 and the @entity333 through the land crossings			1
the official said @entity5 hopes that there will be a way to overcome the controversy with @entity2 and will continue to work toward that goal			1
" as to the ambassador in @entity2 , he had finished his posting a couple of days ago and had already said goodbye to his @entity2 colleagues and was expected in @entity5 in the coming days , " the @entity5 official said			1
@entity1 's @entity345 , @entity346 , @entity347 , @entity348 , @entity349 and @entity350 contributed to this report			0

new : soldiers acted in self - defense , @entity5 says
new : the @entity24 and @entity150 regret a @entity24 report did n't bridge the @entity5 - @entity2 rift
@entity2 wants an apology from @entity5 over the flotilla raid
disagreements over @entity12 have caused ties to deteriorate
