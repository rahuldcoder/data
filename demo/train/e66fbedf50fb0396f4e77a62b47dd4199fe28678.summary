-- it may be early days in the quest for energy underneath the crystal blue waters of the @entity5 -- but the eventual bounty may be sizable for @entity7			1
the @entity5 is considered a new energy frontier with a 2010 report from the @entity10 estimating there to be 122 trillion cubic feet of gas in the area			1
nearby @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 have also marked their offshore territories and are evaluating their potential			0
but for @entity7 , still bitterly divided between a @entity22 @entity7 south and @entity24 @entity7 north , the rewards could be more than just financial			2
according to the @entity7 ' president @entity27 , this rich supply of energy could help unite the island			1
" the benefits out of the exploitation of the wealth of energy is going to the interest of all the people of @entity7 whether they are @entity22 or @entity24 @entity7 , " @entity27 told @entity0			1
" what i 'm saying and trying to convince our compatriots is that the wealth is belonging to the state , the residents of @entity7			2
you ( @entity41 ) have the nationality of @entity7 as well , let 's find a solution on the basis as has been agreed then you will have your proportion in participating in this wealth			2
" @entity48 based @entity47 undertook its first drilling work in @entity7 waters last summer			2
@entity52 firm @entity51 and @entity53 of @entity54 , meanwhile , will start exploration later this year			0
in between the ports of @entity58 and @entity59 there are plans for a $ 10 billion facility to manage the natural gas discovered offshore			1
@entity7 officials say that the reserves in the one block that has been surveyed so far , when brought to market , would represent more than 100 % of the country 's gdp of $ 23 billion dollars			1
early indications from @entity70 also hint that there are many millions of barrels of oil in their field as well			0
with such a potentially valuable asset , @entity27 believes it is important to take heed of the experiences of other countries with large energy reserves and for @entity7 not to be caught out by the resource curse			1
" that 's why we are talking about the @entity91 model , " he said referring to the @entity84 nation 's sovereign wealth fund that invests a large chunk of the money generated from its own underwater oil and gas fields			1
at the same time @entity27 hopes to manage expectations as to the level of wealth @entity7 can expect to gain			2
" we are trying to pass on to people that when we talk about energy we are talking about future generations and not for the present only			0
" however it is important that they " do not have any expectations that we are going to become like the @entity100 and so on , " he added			0
@entity27 also recognizes that external factors have the potential impact how this lucrative new industry develops in the region			0
he points out that @entity24 has been " violating ( @entity7 's ) economic zone " in recent years as they attempt to influence relations between @entity22 and @entity24 @entity7			1
these actions may still come to impact attempts to unify the country in the future , he said , but he is confident that will ultimately not be the case			0
" all of us nowadays are realizing that it 's a high time to give an end to these this protracted problem			0
this is why i have mentioned before as an incentive the energy , the hydrocarbons and all these kinds of things			0
