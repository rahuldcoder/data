-- i was in @entity2 when i first learned of a controversy over an inscription marking the new @entity5 in @entity6			1
the quote on one side of the granite " @entity5 " reads , " i was a drum major for justice , peace and righteousness			1
" in an interview with the @entity14 , poet @entity12 argued that these were not @entity17 's exact words and that , out of context , they made a humble preacher look like " an arrogant twit			1
" @entity12 expressed no concern with 14 other quotations from @entity17 that appear on a 450 - foot - long memorial behind his statue			1
by coincidence , this news found me as i began research for a book on the power of short writing			0
i 've learned that we often use the shortest texts to express the most important messages , especially to honor and enshrine			0
@entity37 did not invent short writing			0
from tattoos to gravestones to the base of monuments , we choose words with special care because we want them to last forever			2
in a short text , every word counts			0
but with concision can come the loss of context			2
the overwhelming impression of the new memorial derives , not from language , but from sculpture			2
even small photos of the new statue make @entity17 look monumental			0
he stands 30 feet tall , strong and determined , arms folded , looking as if he just marched out of the huge block of stone behind him			0
memorial to be dedicated sunday in the presence of such powerful imagery , why the argument over a single sentence ? @entity12 's concerns were echoed by other @entity66 - @entity65 scholars and leaders , who argued the 10 words on the monument base have been ripped from their original context and meaning			1
in a sermon at @entity2 's @entity73 , just months before his death in 1968 , @entity17 preached , " yes , if you want to say that i was a drum major , say that i was a drum major for justice			1
say that i was a drum major for peace			1
i was a drum major for righteousness			1
and all the other shallow things will not matter			0
" in context , the word " if " makes all the difference			2
without that opening conditional clause , it does seem that @entity17 is embracing the role of drum major rather than acquiescing to it			1
i did not understand , until i visited @entity93 and other historically black colleges and universities , the importance of the drum major in african - american culture			1
the drum major is a white @entity65 icon , too , of course , flamboyant even by the strait - laced @entity103 standards of @entity106 's " @entity105			1
" translated by famous black college marching bands , as pictured in the 2002 film " @entity111 , " flamboyance transforms itself into soulful spectacle			0
to get a feel for the presence and status of drum majors , check out @entity117 videos of auditions for that honored position			2
in addition to musical and leadership skills , the drum major must be able to strut , dance , spin , prance and perform backbreaking bends and splits -- without missing a beat			1
at the @entity128 where i work , marble plaques in a central garden offer students inspirational sayings			0
famous writing teacher @entity133 quotes the @entity135 poet @entity134 : " @entity136 , " @entity137 for " @entity138 " of writing			0
the engraver , not schooled in @entity137 , left out the word " @entity142 " ( without ) , leaving us with dead - language gibberish that could be taken to mean the opposite of the original			0
" oh well , " i said when i saw the mistake , " at least it 's not carved in stone			2
" when we use the phrase " carved in stone , " we denote something permanent , irreversible , unchangeable			0
but it ai n't necessarily so			0
ignoring my suggestion that we copy - edit the marble text with a magic marker , my boss ordered a corrected version of @entity133 's quote			1
everything i 've learned about the language of enshrinement suggests that the inscription on the @entity17 monument should be revised			0
it need not be changed right away or in a way that would embarrass those who chose the original			0
any revision should grow from a desire to perfect for posterity a magisterial work that springs from the noblest intentions			0
i know of no written standards for historical inscriptions , but the unwritten ones could come down to these two : 1 ) quotes from the dead should never be taken out of context ; 2 ) quotations should reveal the honored character in the proper light -- or a better light			2
the drum major quote fulfills neither of these standards			1
to restore most of the original context would require the addition of 12 short words : " if you want to say that i was a drum major , say that			1
... " a tighter compromise could be " if you say i was a drum major , say			1
... " at the very least , a single word added to the existing quote would restore a bit of @entity17 's intended meaning : " say i was a drum major for peace			1
... " every writer i know has had an editor who , to save space , has cut a passage to the bone			0
done well , the meaning can ring clearer with fewer words			1
done poorly , something critical to the reader 's understanding is left behind			2
the problem is serious enough when it occurs on paper or in pixels , even more serious when it 's carved in stone			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .			2

@entity12 *reportedly* has *objected* to a quote inscribed on @entity216
@entity213 : the " drum major for justice " quote was taken out of context
@entity213 says it 's crucial to preserve meaning when words are *excerpted*
king memorial will be dedicated sunday in @entity6
