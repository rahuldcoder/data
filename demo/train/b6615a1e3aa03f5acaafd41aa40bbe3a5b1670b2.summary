while @entity1 is the unofficial end of summer , it 's also the unofficial start to the campaign season			1
that means politicking will be on the rise , especially as control of the @entity8 is at stake as well as control of 36 state houses			2
so , if you turn on your tv , expect to see more -- and nastier -- political advertisements			2
in fact , @entity15 , senior vice president of @entity16 , says as much as $ 3.4 billion is going to be spent on advertising this midterm season			1
the race with the most at stake is the one for @entity8 in @entity22			2
this is not just one of the only @entity8 races @entity26 are at risk of losing , but also the race where the top @entity8 @entity26 is at risk of losing his job			1
the @entity26 leader of the @entity8 , @entity32 , is in a fight for his political life against @entity35 , a relatively inexperienced @entity36 politician who was just 8 years old when @entity37 started his first term in the @entity8 in 1985			0
@entity37 , a shrewd politician , prolific fundraiser and expert campaigner , has had numerous missteps , making this race even more interesting			0
his troubles include a flubbed campaign ad , a campaign manager who was a little too honest , the recent resignation of that manager and a caught - on - tape moment			1
@entity35 , meanwhile , has also stumbled when talking about foreign policy , and questions have arisen about a possible sweetheart deal involving her campaign bus			1
this is one of the most interesting and critical races in the country			1
how @entity32 crushed the tea party here are four other races that are worth watching : @entity60 governor : the @entity60 governor 's race has many national repercussions , as @entity64 gov. @entity64 is locked in a tight re-election battle against former trek bicycle executive @entity66			1
economic policy is a central component of this campaign			1
@entity64 has gained prominence in conservative politics for governing as a fiscal conservative and making deep cuts to spending by cutting public union workers ' pensions			0
he also drastically limited workers ' bargaining rights			0
meanwhile , @entity36 , backed by labor unions , are again fighting to defeat @entity64 -- they forced a recall two years ago that @entity64 won -- to move forward on more @entity36 economic policies , including lifting the minimum wage			0
@entity64 , who is also being investigated for alleged illegal campaign coordination with outside groups , is considered a potential 2016 @entity26 presidential candidate , but if he loses his gubernatorial race , his path to the presidency will be very , very narrow			1
democrats and @entity26 understand the stakes , and president @entity91 traveled to @entity60 on @entity1 to speak at a union event in a trip packed with political symbolism			1
@entity64 , @entity95 tied up in new poll @entity8 , @entity97 : @entity36 sen. @entity98 always has tough races , and her fourth bid for the @entity8 seat is no exception			1
@entity103 rep. @entity103 is the person who is giving @entity98 another difficult run			0
@entity103 is tying @entity98 to @entity91 in this conservative - leaning state while painting her as a corrupt @entity107 insider			1
@entity98 , meanwhile , is attempting to paint her @entity8 tenure as a picture of independence			0
most interestingly , a political roller coaster is possible			0
if @entity98 or @entity103 does n't receive more than 50 % of the vote on @entity114 in november , a winner wo n't be named until that state 's december 6 election			2
there 's a chance the @entity97 race , and the balance of the @entity8 , might be dragged out until december			0
sen. @entity98 to reimburse @entity8 for charter flight national democrats go after @entity103 on @entity124 @entity8 , @entity125 : when popular sen. @entity126 decided to retire , @entity36 had a small panic attack as this solidly @entity36 seat was now in play			0
but when rep. @entity131 jumped in , @entity36 ' confidence was restored			0
but then that confidence has been shaken as @entity131 has run a gaffe - prone campaign that involves digs at farmers and meandering chickens			1
his missteps -- combined with the surprising strength of @entity26 candidate @entity139 , who has run a great campaign that began with a breakout performance in the crowded @entity26 primary -- make this a possible and unexpected pickup for @entity26			2
climate group attacks @entity139 on tax pledge , not climate @entity149 's 2nd @entity148 : there is little to no chance that @entity26 will lose control of the @entity153 , and some race analyzers say the @entity26 will even pick up seats			0
but this race could be a bright spot for @entity36			0
even in what is expected to be a difficult year for @entity36 , @entity36 candidate @entity158 could pull out a victory in this @entity26 - leaning district of @entity162 and the central part of the @entity164			2
she has no problem getting money -- raising more than @entity170 -- and she has a @entity149 - famous last name			2
her father is longtime sen. @entity165 , giving her access to his connections and deep knowledge of running successful campaigns			0
