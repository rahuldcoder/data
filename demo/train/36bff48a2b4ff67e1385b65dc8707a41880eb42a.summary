there has always been a fine line between freedom of speech and the right to practice one 's religion in the way one sees fit			0
the @entity7 struggled over these rights in framing the @entity9 , with @entity10 calling for " a wall of separation " between church and state -- a wall that has become mighty thin in recent years			0
but now , the freedom to practice religion on campuses around the country , including at @entity19 -- an elite liberal arts college in @entity21 -- has crashed into anti-discrimination policies , which also have a long and complicated history in this country			1
the gist of the story is this : the @entity27 , a conservative religious group that has lived quietly on campus for four decades , is being kicked off the official roster of college - backed groups			2
their keys to college buildings have already been confiscated , and the administration wo n't recognize them any longer			2
the problem is that this group , like many groups of its ilk , insist their leaders must adhere to its version of @entity44 doctrine			1
this problem is widespread now , playing out across the country , as at @entity48 and @entity49 , where @entity44 groups , including , earlier , a @entity52 organization at @entity49 , have been forced off - campus because they refuse to allow their leadership to be drawn from people who do n't adhere to their essential tenets			1
let me put this plainly : @entity61 , we have a problem ! i 've been a college professor for nearly four decades , and i 've seen problems with the so - called thought police come and go over the years			1
at the height of the problem in the mid- ' 80 and ' 90s , it was imagined by many -- especially those on the right -- that universities had become politically correct to the point where any kind of conservative thought was forbidden			2
certainly these were vital years for the advancement of feminist thought in particular , and for the acceptance of gays as full citizens within the academy ( full acceptance by the society at large is only now taking hold )			2
for the most part , i always thought the idea of a liberal thought police was nonsense			1
i 'm a progressive @entity44 , and i do n't support any kind of discrimination			1
@entity92 himself certainly demonstrated that one should seek to bring those at the margins of society into the fold			0
i 'm quite appalled by what is going on at @entity19 , @entity48 , @entity49 and elsewhere			1
does n't common sense suggest that you should not be the leader of a @entity44 organization if you do n't adhere to @entity44 tenets ? would a university or college really tell the @entity106 on campus that they ca n't elect only @entity108 to leadership positions ? my gut tells me that it 's only sensible to allow religion organizations to elect leaders who adhere to the teachings of the religion that serves as the organizing principle for that group			1
there is , indeed , a bias against conservative @entity120 on campuses			2
and there are some reasons for this , as certain strains of conservative religious practice have been fiercely discriminatory over the past couple of centuries in the @entity129			0
there has also been an unfortunate anti-intellectual strain in the more fundamentalist groups of @entity120 , one that pervades @entity129 society as a whole , and creates problems for the practice of science , for instance , when it comes to subjects such as evolution and climate change			2
it 's no wonder that academic communities tend to resist groups that abhor rational thought			1
but there is no basic conflict between -- again , for instance -- science and religion , between having a profound spiritual practice and wishing to uphold the highest standards within the academy when it comes to nondiscrimination			0
@entity160 , in fact , may well be one of the benefits that comes from having both an intellectual and a spiritual life			0
this means allowing for certain differences of opinion , letting a thousand flowers bloom			0
for the most part , conservative groups on campuses simply wish to study the @entity171 together , pray and worship in ways that deepen their own sense of @entity176			1
they might even let someone like myself -- a @entity44 of a different stripe -- sit down and discuss their views			1
a campus is , or ought to be , a space where contradictory ideas are allowed to flourish , where genuine and deeply respectful debate can occur			0
i would urge colleges and universities to give these kids their keys back			0
let them elect officers in their organization who actually adhere to the ideas promoted by the group			0
that 's the essence of democracy			0
as long as these groups do n't practice hatred or discrimination , or try to impose their views on others , let them be			1
our intellectual communities flourish when there are all kinds of ideas circulating , even ones we find curious or objectionable .			0

@entity208 : campuses are placing problematic *restrictions* on *evangelical* groups
he notes that at @entity19 , officials want to impose their *vision* on groups ' leadership
he says he is a liberal @entity44 who opposes discrimination , but this is not sensible
@entity208 : if groups do n't impose their views or discriminate , keep thought police out of it
