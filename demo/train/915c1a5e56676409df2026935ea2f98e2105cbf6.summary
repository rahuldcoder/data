his name hints of an unconventional origin and his next journey reveals his desire in doing things " differently " : so differently that @entity7 - @entity6 , 32 , plans to run barefoot from @entity8 to @entity9 in 18 months			1
the " @entity17 " -- as he describes himself because of his @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity8 roots -- departed @entity10 on july 2 and will cross 14 countries all the way down to @entity13 , @entity14 , known as the southernmost city in the world			1
@entity23 's strategy is to run about 25 kilometers ( 15.5 miles ) or two - and - a - half hours -- whichever comes first -- twice a day			1
he will run barefoot because " no one has else done it , " it 's cheaper and he wo n't have to carry lots of pairs of running shoes with him			1
overall , @entity7 's feet will cover 19,000 kilometers ( about 11,806 miles ) of roads , a distance nearly 7,000 kilometers ( 4,349 miles ) greater than the @entity36 's diameter			1
@entity37 's also plans to raise funds for an organization to promote education of each country that he runs across			1
for now , he has picked an organization in @entity8 and @entity21			1
his inspiration : @entity45 's motorcycle journey across @entity46 and the case of a @entity49 rugby team stranded in the mountains for over two months after their plane crashed in the @entity52			0
but his " true guru " is the @entity54 mountaineer @entity53 , who has climbed all 14 " eight - thousanders " peaks ( mountains over 8,000 meters or 26,000 feet above sea level ) without oxygen			1
" i thought my friends did n't believe me " @entity37 has just graduated from @entity61 in @entity10 where he obtained an industrial engineering degree			1
he was part of the university 's cross-country running club			2
however , not even his running teammates , he says , believed he was going to start the adventure			0
" they tell me i 'm crazy and i thought my friends did n't believe me , " he told @entity68 days before starting his adventure			0
his family supports him , though his dad remains " concerned , " even though @entity37 has done his best to reassure him			2
@entity37 compares the skeptics of his journey to those who doubted @entity76 ' plan to sail across the @entity77			2
" it is like telling @entity79 : ' you are crazy , the @entity36 is flat and your boat will drop off ' -- he would never have sailed and discovered that the @entity36 is round			2
" why did he " hang up the sneakers ? " @entity37 has been training for over a year			2
to prepare himself -- " because the mechanics are different , " -- he says , he has run barefoot on almost all the surfaces he will find along the road and during all his training sessions , he wore the backpack he will carry with him through the journey			1
before he started training , he read about the @entity92 tribe , the history of human exploration and the minimalistic running trend , that according to @entity21 marathon runner @entity96 , could be " a response in our society where there 's so much of everything			2
" @entity37 's barefoot training has been gradual and so far , the longest distance he has run is 20 kilometers ( a little over 12 miles , ) , with four of those ( 2.48 miles ) in the snow			1
according to @entity96 , the most harmful surfaces for the human feet are pavement or running tracks , and for this reason @entity37 will try to avoid paved roads			1
he is carrying only four pairs of sandals whose soles are designed specially for running and he plans to wear them when his feet become sensitive			2
@entity37 has n't followed a specific diet since he will eat " what i can find " along the way			0
he will try to consume chia seeds , a food source that " contains 21 % protein , a level markedly greater than other nutritional grains such as wheat , corn , rice , oats , barley , and amaranth , " according to the @entity129			0
his sponsors will also provide him with granola bars and vegetable supplements			0
" no one will follow me			0
" he picked this journey because he wants to be different from other adventurers such as @entity136 , who has also run around the world			0
the difference : he has worn his running shoes and a support team escorted him along his treks			0
unlike @entity142 , " no one will follow me , " @entity37 said			0
his route has been based on the seasons so he does n't run during winter			0
he knows where he will be every day , so in december he plans to be in @entity146 , but he refrains from giving more dates and places because he does n't know what could happen along the way			0
he is aware of the risks , from robberies to encounters with wild animals			0
he is only carrying a first aid kit and an emergency button to be rescued by helicopter if needed , and although @entity37 tries not to think about it , he says that if something does happen to him , he will go back to @entity8 to be treated and then he 'll resume his journey			1
" i will not give up easily , " he insisted			0
