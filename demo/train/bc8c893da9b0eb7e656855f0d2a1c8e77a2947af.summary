-- you know you 've reached the summer box office doldrums when not a single new wide release is able to break $ 7 million over the friday - to - sunday period			1
such was the case this weekend , when the top 12 movies grossed a cumulative $ 83.4 million , which makes this the least attended frame at the box office since december 9 - 11 , 2011 , when the top 12 films earned just $ 67.8 million			1
once again , " @entity19 " led the chart , dropping 53 percent from its opening frame to $ 13.5 million -- the lowest total for a no. 1 movie since that aforementioned december frame when " @entity18 " topped the chart with a sad $ 13.0 million			1
after 10 days , " @entity21 2 , " which carries a reported $ 100 million budget , has grossed $ 52.3 million and is running well behind the total of the original " expendables , " which had grossed $ 65.4 million at the same point in its run			2
the @entity26 action entry may finish with just under $ 80 million			2
in second place , @entity28 's $ 125 million sequel " @entity27 " slid by 46 percent in its third weekend to $ 9.3 million , which lifted its total to $ 85.5 million			1
the spy thriller , which has @entity33 taking over leading man duties from @entity35 , will not be able to match the $ 121.7 million domestic cume of the original " @entity37 , " which debuted in june 2002			2
@entity38 looks like it will have to settle for about $ 105 million			2
@entity42 ' " @entity41 " finished in third place with $ 8.6 million			1
the creepy stop - motion ' toon dipped 39 percent and has now earned $ 28.3 million after two weekends			1
the 2009 flick " @entity47 , " which , like " @entity41 , " was also produced by @entity46 , had earned $ 35 million at the same point in its run , and that film finished with $ 75.3 million domestically			1
" @entity41 , " for which @entity42 did not provide budget information ( though it likely cost about the same as @entity47 â € ” $ 60 million ) may climb to about $ 60 - 65 million			1
' @entity54 ' : @entity56 station wo n't air it @entity59 ' political comedy " @entity60 " held solid in its third weekend , declining 43 percent to $ 7.4 million			1
the @entity63 / @entity62 collaboration has earned $ 64.5 million total			2
two other holdovers finished close behind			0
" @entity68 " fell 35 percent to $ 7.2 million , which lifts its total to $ 422.2 million			1
it will surpass " @entity72 " to become the tenth highest - grossing film of all time this week			0
close behind this week , " the @entity76 " dropped 34 percent to $ 7.1 million , giving @entity74 's $ 25 million family drama a 12 - day total of $ 27.1 million			1
way back in seventh place was the first of this weekend 's new releases , the @entity78 bike messenger thriller " @entity81 , " which could only pedal $ 6.3 million worth of tickets from 2,225 theaters			1
@entity87 's $ 32 million action film , which was moved from january to august late last year earned a " b " cinemascore grade			1
the misfire still did better than its fellow newcomers			0
@entity92 's aggressively marketed comedy " @entity93 , " which stars @entity94 , @entity95 , and @entity96 , bombed in tenth place with $ 4.7 million from a whopping 2,870 theaters			1
audiences issued the film a dismal " c + " cinemascore grade			0
@entity59 ' $ 17 million horror entry " @entity103 " found just $ 3 million ( enough for 12th place ) despite the presence of two mega-franchise stars : " @entity110 's " @entity107 and @entity109 's @entity108			1
this performance was expected , as the film was given almost no promotion and played in only 810 theaters			0
on a frame filled with lackluster holdovers and fizzling newcomers , the biggest story this weekend is certainly the breakout performance of conservative documentary " 2016 : @entity122 's @entity121 , " which expanded from 169 to 1,091 theaters and grossed an impressive $ 6.2 million -- a 401 percent increase from its previous frame			1
@entity126 : celeb tributes on @entity128 the $ 2.5 million indie , distributed by @entity131 , has enjoyed increasing per theater averages over the last two weekends ( read a more in - depth analysis about the film here ) , and although its per theater average decreased slightly from $ 7,365 to $ 5,718 this weekend ( this was all but expected given the massive jump in theaters ) , it still notched the highest per theater average in the @entity140			2
" 2016 " has earned $ 9.1 million after seven weekends , making it the highest grossing conservative documentary ever , above " expelled : no intelligence allowed , " which grossed $ 7.7 million in 2008			2
while the film has already earned more than most documentaries could ever dream of earning ( @entity150 's much - publicized doc @entity149 grossed $ 3.5 million ) , its gross does n't yet compare to @entity152 's liberal doc " @entity153 , " which grossed $ 119.2 million in 2004 , @entity155 's re-election year			1
keep in mind that film had a major studio ( @entity26 ) and marketing campaign behind it , and it opened in 868 theaters			0
2016 opened in one theater -- in @entity162 -- and had to rely on word - of - mouth and talk radio promotions before its national ad campaign kicked off two weeks ago			0
with the @entity167 right around the corner , and the heightened awareness that " 2016 's " box office performance this weekend will bring , it 's likely that the @entity172 documentary will stick around at the box office as word - of - mouth about its existence continues to spread			0
while it would be downright shocking for the film to climb as high as " @entity153 " -- and , to be clear , i think that scenario is very unlikely -- at this point , there 's no telling how much it will earn			0
two other tidbits : last weekend 's runner - up , " @entity185 , " plummeted 64 percent to 11th place with $ 4.2 million			1
after 10 days , the @entity188 drama has grossed a paltry $ 18.9 million			2
in limited release , @entity193 's " @entity192 " broke the house record at the @entity191 , pulling in $ 65,000			2
a press release for the film boasts that this is a " @entity196			0
" what record did it break , you ask ? according to the release , the film scored " the highest per - screen debut for an @entity121 non-animated film from a first - time filmmaker			0
