@entity0 -- cast members of the hit television show " @entity6 , " who are suing @entity5 , accused the company of " despicable conduct " for not paying them for merchandising revenues			1
the comment was made in court papers filed by the actors ' attorney in response to a claim by @entity5 that the case had no merit			1
" in this lawsuit , plaintiffs seek their share of the money collected by defendants as a result of the use of the actors ' names and likenesses in connection with merchandising , " the document , filed by attorney @entity19 in @entity20 , said			1
" plaintiffs also want the jury to punish defendants for their despicable conduct			0
" four members of the cast -- @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 -- along with the widow of @entity44 , sued @entity5 in april , claiming they have not been paid what they 're owed for the worldwide sale of " @entity6 " merchandise			1
" @entity6 " was originally on the air from 1974 to 1984			2
@entity41 : " unfortunately , now ' @entity6 ' also represents the worst of @entity50			2
" under their contracts , the actors were supposed to receive 5 % of net proceeds , or 2Â½ % if their images were used in a group			0
in interviews with @entity1 earlier this year , the four cast members said they decided to move forward after discovering " @entity6 " slot machines were popping up in casinos around the country in 2008			1
" this is one of the most heavily merchandised shows ever , " @entity40 said			0
" people loved ' @entity6 , ' and it 's been on everything from bedsheets to lunch boxes			2
" the suit asks for $ 10 million in damages			0
@entity70 : ' @entity6 ' actors claim fraud , money owed for merchandising the latest court filing follows a response by @entity5 to the suit last month			1
the company , which owns the show , said the actors are " attempting to generate a lucrative litigation windfall by riddling their complaint with unsupported and overreaching causes of action " for fraud and breach of good faith			2
@entity5 said this was " all done in a transparent attempt to introduce the specter of punitive damages " in the case			0
@entity5 called the case " a garden - variety breach of contract action , nothing more			0
" but the actors fired back , saying " although defendants routinely rebrand their corporate images , they should not be permitted to rebrand the truth			0
" they pointed out that they have not " sought damages for speculative profits they had hoped to make on a risky business deal " or for a " windfall of money from conduct that did not harm them			0
" the company disputed that it " concealed " its obligation to pay merchandising revenues			2
instead , it said the actors " were simply ignorant of , or slept upon their own rights			0
that can not serve as a basis for a fraud claim			0
" but , in the latest court filing , the actors said @entity5 " should not be rewarded for concealing the money they made and not paying the actors			1
" " it would place a tremendous burden on studios and production companies if every actor in the entertainment industry were required to call each company they ever worked for to inquire whether merchandising had occurred , and if so , whether any money is due , " the court filing said			1
" in order to remove that burden and standardize the process , the customary practice in the entertainment industry is to provide periodic statements to actors when money has been generated in connection with merchandise			0
" in 2002 and 2003 , @entity143 contacted @entity5 about merchandising revenues but was told nothing was owed , the filing states			1
since the lawsuit was filed , @entity5 has sent checks totaling $ 43,403 in merchandising proceeds to the four actors and @entity44 's widow , @entity150			1
@entity19 told @entity1 he was holding onto the checks because @entity5 could argue the case had been settled if they were cashed			2
in a statement issued before the lawsuit was filed , @entity5 said it agreed that the actors " are owed royalties from the merchandising of ' @entity6 ' and have , in fact , been working with their representatives for some time to see that they are paid what they are due			1
" the company did not immediately respond to a @entity1 request for further comment about the court filing			1
the actors said @entity5 claimed it did not pay them for the " @entity6 " slot machine proceeds due " to oversight			1
" however , the actors point out that @entity172 , who played @entity173 on the show , was paid for the use of his image on the slots			2
neither @entity172 nor @entity178 , who played @entity179 on the show , are part of the lawsuit			0
in addition , from 2008 to january 2011 , @entity5 issued news releases announcing licensing agreements with 14 companies that include gift items , clothing , glassware and bar accessories , the court filing said			1
but in revenue statements sent to @entity19 after the lawsuit was filed , @entity5 did not include any revenue from four of those companies			2
@entity41 told @entity1 this week that the case is " like ' @entity6 ' versus @entity196			0
here 's one show and we 're putting one of the biggest corporations in the world on the line to do the right thing			0
i 'm hoping this case gives visibility to not only help us , but to help thousands of other individuals in the entertainment business			0
