-- and the best debut ever for an original comedic storyline			0
what went right ? according to @entity27 's president of domestic distribution @entity28 , " the film			0
the advertising -- that 's what went right ! " during a phone call with @entity0 this morning , @entity33 praised " @entity15 's " advertising campaign kick - off in april , when @entity36 appeared in a 90 - second tv spot during an episode of " @entity12 " and pointed audiences to " @entity15 's " extra-buzzy red - band trailer online			1
clearly , much of the loyal " @entity12 " audience turned out for the opening weekend			1
" it 's been a while since an original , zany comedy has been on the marketplace , " says @entity33			2
" everybody likes something fresh , something new			0
" indeed , they did			0
" @entity15 's " debut frame easily surpassed those of other recent r - rated hits like " @entity52 " ( $ 36.1 million ) , " @entity53 " ( $ 28.3 million ) , " bad teacher " ( $ 31.6 million ) , and @entity13 's own @entity56 flick " @entity57 " ( $ 35.5 million )			1
each of those films exhibited substantial legs at the box office and crossed $ 100 million domestically			2
given " @entity15 's " decent reviews and healthy " a- " @entity65 grade , it should too			1
@entity27 just may have a $ 200 million hit on its hands -- great news considering the film , which was produced by @entity71 , cost just $ 50 million			0
men made up most of the crowds			0
according to @entity27 , @entity15 's audience was 56 % male , while 52 % of moviegoers were 30 or older			1
you know which movie 's audience was n't predominantly male ? " @entity79 's			1
" the endlessly written about stripper film , which is partially inspired by @entity6 's real - life stripper past , grossed a tremendous $ 39.2 million in its opening weekend from audiences which were 73 % female			1
the result is far higher than anyone in the industry would have predicted a month ago , but " @entity79 quickly snowballed into a " @entity22 " - type release and became a must - see " event " for groups of women in the mood for something other than " @entity92			1
" " this is what the business is about , " says @entity96 ' president of @entity97			0
" there are surprises sometimes , and when you get a sleeper , it 's great			0
" for @entity96 , " @entity79 " was already a winner on its opening day , when it grossed a jaw - dropping $ 19.4 million			1
the film was independently financed for $ 7 million by @entity108 , @entity6 and @entity109 ; @entity96 then paid $ 7 million to acquire " @entity79 " from @entity108 , with whom they often collaborate , and agreed to distribute			1
of course , advertising and distribution costs exist as well , but according to @entity116 , " everybody is making a lot of money			0
" while " @entity79 " did score a sizzling debut , the drama also proved incredibly front - loaded			1
( and no , i 'm not talking about @entity121 's character @entity120			0
) after " @entity124 " $ 19.4 million opening day , it fell by a whopping 42 percent on saturday to $ 11.4 million and then a more - standard 26 % on sunday to $ 8.4 million			1
these declines point to a truncated run at the box office â € ” as does the moderate " b " @entity65 grade from audiences , who may have been expecting an upbeat romp from " @entity79 , " which is actually quite a bit darker than advertising suggests			0
thus , only time will tell whether the film passes $ 100 million domestically			0
still , " @entity79 " should n't be viewed as anything but a huge winner -- especially for its star , @entity6 , whose banner year continues			0
following the success of " @entity141 " ( $ 125 million ) , and " @entity52 " ( $ 138.3 million ) , @entity6 's appeal has earned him another smash , and no actor in @entity144 has a higher stock than him right now			1
maybe it 's a good thing that " @entity147 " got pushed ...			0
last weekend 's chart champion , @entity151 - @entity150 's $ 185 million effort " brave , " dropped by 49 % in its second weekend to a still - strong $ 34 million -- good for third place			1
the @entity154 adventure raced past the $ 100 million mark on its eighth day of release and has now earned $ 131.7 million after two weekends			2
a good comparison for " brave " is another @entity150 favorite " @entity163 , " which also dropped by 49 % in its second weekend and had earned $ 127.2 million at the same point in its run			1
" @entity163 " finished with $ 223 million domestically , and that seems like a probable total for " brave " as well			2
in fourth , " @entity171 " started with a potent $ 26.4 million from 2,161 theaters -- a bit ahead of the director 's last @entity169 film , " @entity168 , " which debuted to $ 25.1 million in 2011			2
" witness protection 's " small uptick is an encouraging sign for the cross-dressing franchise , which was beginning to show signs of age when " @entity168 " earned " just " $ 53.3 million , a full 41 % less than 2009â € ²s " @entity178 , " which grossed $ 90.5 million			1
audiences issued the picture , which cost $ 20 million , an " a- " @entity65 grade			0
rounding out the @entity184 is @entity186 ' $ 145 million sequel " @entity187 3 : @entity189 's @entity188 , " which has held up quite well in the face of " @entity159 " over the past two weeks			2
" @entity192 " dropped 40 % this weekend to $ 11.8 million and has now grossed $ 180 million after four frames			1
the zoo animal comedy has stampeded up the box office faster than either of its predecessors -- at the same point in its run , " @entity187 : @entity199 " had earned $ 159.1 million			1
" @entity189 's @entity188 " is now poised to be the highest domestic earner in the franchise , and it will soon outdo the original " @entity187 's " $ 193.6 million haul			2
down in tenth place , @entity151 's family drama " @entity206 " flopped almost as badly as last weekend 's " @entity207			1
" despite overall positive reviews , " @entity206 " grossed a measly $ 4.3 million from 2,055 theaters			2
good thing the @entity212 / @entity211 drama , which earned a " b + " cinemascore grade , carries a light $ 16 million budget			2
overall , the box office is demonstrating remarkable health			0
without a giant action movie in the @entity220 , the current lineup was still able to set a june box office record with a cumulative gross well above $ 200 million			0
( i 'll add in exact figures when they become available			0
) some are saying that the heat wave sweeping across the @entity229 is driving people into cool , air - conditioned theaters , and in a poll posted yesterday , 59 % of readers voted that the heat does , in fact , make them more likely to go to the theater			0
it should also be noted that neither of the top two films are in @entity239 1			0
@entity15 -- $ 54.1 million 2			1
@entity79 -- $ 39.2 million 3			1
brave -- $ 34.0 million 4			2
@entity171 -- $ 26.4 million 5			0
