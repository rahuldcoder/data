-- for decades , pioneering environmentalist @entity1 , the founder and editor of the @entity3 , opposed the use of nuclear power			1
now he sees it as vital to efforts to combat climate change			0
earlier this month , @entity1 made the case for nuclear power in a debate with @entity13 professor @entity12 at the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16			1
( @entity14 is a nonprofit that took its name from the subjects of technology , information and design and is dedicated to " ideas worth spreading			0
" it publishes talks on all subjects at @entity25 / ) his outspoken support for nuclear power comes as the @entity28 has been pushing for the first new nuclear plants in the @entity30 in three decades			1
last week , president @entity31 announced $ 8.3 billion in loan guarantees for adding two nuclear reactors at an existing plant in @entity35 , @entity36 , near @entity37			1
@entity12 says nuclear power is too risky @entity1 says his turnabout began in 2002 , when the @entity40 , a consulting organization he co-founded , did a project on climate change for the @entity30 secretary of defense			1
in an interview with @entity0 , @entity1 said the project showed him that the globe 's climate can change abruptly : " it goes over some tipping point and suddenly you 're in a situation that you do n't like and you ca n't go back			1
that got me way more concerned about climate as a clear and present danger than i had been			2
" looking for a surefire way to cut greenhouse gases , @entity1 said the alternative to burning coal became clear : " we already had a very good supplier of ... electricity			1
it worked like mad and was as clean as it could be -- and that was nuclear			2
" looking at nuclear more closely made me look at coal more closely and i got to realizing what a horror it was across the board , and as i learned more about nuclear , i started learning all this stuff that my fellow environmentalists had been careful not to let me know about			1
" read about @entity73 ' argument for nuclear power @entity1 spoke to @entity0 wednesday			1
here is an edited transcript : @entity0 : what did your fellow environmentalists get wrong about nuclear power ? @entity1 : well , things like , nuclear radiation is a terrible thing that we must all fear at any scale , and nuclear waste a thing that we must be horrified about , with it lasting hundreds of thousands of years and how dare we burden future generations with that			1
i started looking at the basic scientific and engineering lore on both those subjects			0
... they are interesting engineering problems that are mostly solved already			2
@entity0 : how have they been solved ? brand : anti-nuclear people have been saying , since @entity100 [ a proposed nuclear waste repository in @entity102 ] wo n't work or ca n't work , then you ca n't have nuclear			1
but then you think we do have nuclear , so nuclear waste must be coming out of these reactors ... so where 's it going ? it 's going right there on the site in these dry cask storage containers where it does n't seem to bother anybody			1
you can go out and look at them , stand next to them , no bad things happen			0
so it 's already de-demonized as you see it as not this huge intractable problem			2
it 's actually quite tractable and on a local level			2
and carting the stuff around is treated as such a terrible thing and " my @entity125 , what if there 's an accident ? " and you look at the videos that were made at @entity131 [ @entity132 ] years ago where they ran a locomotive into one of the containers , and no bad thing happened , and then they burned it in jet fuel , and no bad thing happened , dropped it from a great height , no bad thing happened			0
you start to realize this is actually pretty well in hand			0
and the rest of the story on that is the next generation of reactors , the so - called fourth - generation reactors , most of them use what we now call nuclear waste as fuel			1
... so a lot of the waste issue goes away when you realize that a very good thing to do is to just park it somewhere while we think about whether we do want to stick it in the ground or use it in these fourth generation reactors			2
one of the things i learned is that we 've already been burying nuclear waste in @entity171 at the waste isolation pilot plant for 10 years now			1
it 's a salt formation 3,000 foot thick -- you go half a mile down and that salt formation has been there for 250 million years			0
it 's not going anywhere			0
... it 's a perfectly good place to stash this stuff if you want to get rid of it			0
environmentalists will say there 's no working nuclear repository anywhere in the world and you look and actually there 's one being built in @entity190			2
@entity0 : what about the potential for a release of radiation ? brand : the requirement is that no more than 15 millirems of radiation gets out to the public a year , and when a lady goes to get a mammogram she gets twice that			1
when you move from @entity204 to @entity205 , the background radiation goes up five times that			2
and in medicine , we routinely use radioactive isotopes for a whole manner of diagnostic procedures , for x-rays and ct scans			0
... then you look at the medical studies , the epidemiology			0
people have been looking for human harm from radiation for a long time , ever since @entity222 and @entity223			2
and it came as a surprise to me to learn , there were no birth defects in children born to exposed parents in @entity222 and @entity223			0
when the @entity232 went to study the @entity234 area after the accident there , there were no birth defects turning up in the women who had been pregnant during that exposure			0
meanwhile , some anti-nuclear organizations have been using horrifying photographs of deformed babies with gross birth defects and saying these were caused by @entity234			0
it 's just a lie , so that 's a little alarming to see scare tactics like that based on nonscience			0
obviously you do not want to go and get close to nuclear fuel			2
on the other hand , when you take the fuel out of the reactor and put it in storage , 175 years , seven generations later , the radioactivity of that fuel is one billionth of what it is when you took it out of the reactors			0
this stuff actually has a half - life that is good			2
... @entity265 does n't have a half life , when mercury gets into the system , it bioconcentrates to the point where we tell pregnant women not to eat wild fish and shellfish because the mercury has accumulated , mostly from coal burning			1
... @entity0 : what about nuclear proliferation , the potential for spread of nuclear weapons due to greater use of nuclear power ? brand : first of all you want to separate out nations where that 's a worry and where it 's not a worry			1
@entity290 and @entity291 we really need to have stop burning coal			1
... now is there a proliferation issue there ? not really -- @entity290 and @entity291 have nuclear weapons			2
the figure i quoted at @entity14 was that 21 nations have nuclear power , only seven have nuclear weapons , and in every case they got the nuclear weapons first , then the nuclear power			1
@entity304 has nuclear power -- 40 percent of their power is from nuclear			1
do we worry about them having nuclear weapons ? probably not			2
so then that leaves a few countries that we are concerned about			0
@entity314 would like to be one			0
that 's where @entity31 's program for fuel banking , which was actually started in a very intelligent way by the @entity320 administration , is the classic workaround			0
it 's a thing which lets you know basically where all the fissile material is going in the countries that join the program			0
... the great thing about nuclear weapons is when you downgrade the weapons - grade uranium , you get very good nuclear fuel			1
that 's what the @entity30 has been doing for 10 years with @entity337 nuclear weapons			0
i love the symmetry of that			0
the very warheads that used to be targeted at @entity30 cities to blow them up are now being used to light them			0
@entity0 : some critics of nuclear power say that it takes so long to license and build nuclear power plants it 's not really a practical alternative ? brand : ... things can be accelerated a lot			1
so one of the things the @entity30 is doing is separately licensing -- going through the whole approval process -- reactor designs before they have to be figured out in context of a particular site			0
... then there used to be this long delay of getting site approval , but as it happened , when we slowed down and stopped our reactor building in the mid- 1970s and early 1980s , most of the reactor sites already had permission for additional reactors , so that part has already been done			0
... look , you 're not going to cure greenhouse gases with nuclear , but curing greenhouse gases without nuclear is approximately impossible			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity1 .			1

after decades as a *foe* of nuclear power , @entity1 now believes *strongly* in it
he says the nuclear waste disposal problem has basically been solved
brand says danger of low - level radiation has been *exaggerated*
nuclear power is proven way to reduce greenhouse gases and *replace* coal - burning , he says
