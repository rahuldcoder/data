let " @entity1 " play on : nostalgia for the 1970s heavily influenced spring 's most coveted fashion trends , and industry insiders expect to see the era linger in this year 's fall - winter collections at @entity7 , which started thursday			1
waists are high and layers are long , with extended tunics paired over slim dress shapes like fluid pants ( often with a slight flare ) and long skirts			1
" it 's a slimmer silhouette -- much more concise and much more grown - up , " said @entity15 , who identifies the key trends to emerge from the global runways for fashion forecaster @entity18			2
" it is n't a granola look , as one might say			2
" @entity15 foresees the baby doll dress to become a key item but anticipates the overriding trend to be masculinity with strong elements of bespoke tailoring in a sleeker , slimmer silhouette			1
in line with this tailored look , expect emphasis on the waist with a made - to - measure jacket and relaxed pant combo , flaps on lower pockets or patent belts that nip in the waist			1
the belted waist lends itself well into a slight military aesthetic , with a focus on uniformity and utility			0
because of this , the color palette skews toward olive , forest greens and navy			0
but that 's not the only color story this year : there 's soft , pure neutrals and cosmetic tones like camel and chalky whites that are juxtaposed with warm , rich tones like cognac , saffron and blood orange			0
the @entity63 's top 10 colors for fall 2015 paint a similar picture , with offerings like cadmium orange , dried herb , stormy weather and marsala , which was recently named color of the year			0
" the fall 2015 palette is rooted in multifaceted , androgynous colors that can be worn to portray effortless sophistication across men 's and women 's fashion ; it is the first time we are seeing a truly unisex color palette , " said @entity71 , the executive director of the institute			0
and while the 1970s reign supreme , @entity15 wonders whether things wo n't hark back even further to a time of " historical romanticism , " as she calls it , with high , intricately laced necklines , empire - waisted gowns and tapestry prints .			2
