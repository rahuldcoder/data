-- since news first broke about the shooting at a @entity5 elementary school , people began wondering how something so horrible could happen			0
within a few hours , before the magnitude of the tragedy was fully known , reports began to surface that the shooter , @entity11 , was autistic or had @entity13 's syndrome in addition to a possible personality or anxiety disorder such as obessive - compulsive disorder			1
a relative told investigators that @entity11 had a form of autism , according to a law enforcement official , who spoke under condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the investigation			1
@entity0 has not been able to confirm independently whether @entity11 was diagnosed with autism or @entity13 's syndrome , a higher - functioning form of autism			1
@entity31 , a friend of @entity11 's mother , told @entity0 that @entity11 had @entity13 's syndrome and that he was " very withdrawn emotionally			1
" however , national autism organizations cautioned against speculation about a link between violence and autism or @entity13 's			1
while the motive for this crime is still unknown and may never be fully understood , what is clear , according to experts , is that autism can not be blamed			2
" there is absolutely no evidence or any reliable research that suggests a linkage between autism and planned violence , " the @entity43 said in a statement			1
" to imply or suggest that some linkage exists is wrong and is harmful to more than 1.5 million law - abiding , nonviolent and wonderful individuals who live with autism each day			1
" man with @entity13 's shares thoughts on @entity60 shooting @entity61 of @entity62 said , " @entity63 did not cause this horror			0
" @entity61 , executive vice president for programs and services for the advocacy and research group , is also the father of a son with autism			1
@entity61 said it 's not unusual to want to figure out why someone would commit such a heinous crime , but he also cautioned people to do so responsibly			0
and by definition , he said , people with a diagnosis of autism or @entity13 's are not inclined to commit an act of violence			1
the likelihood of this happening would be no different than the rest of the population , he added			0
with autism , no longer invisible one in 88 children in the @entity86 have autism , according to the latest estimates from the @entity89			2
boys with autism outnumber girls 5 to 1 , according to the @entity89 ; 1 in 54 boys in the @entity86 have autism			2
autism spectrum disorders , including @entity13 's syndrome , are a range of developmental disorders of the brain			1
they can cause significant social impairments , communication problems and restricted , repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior			0
it 's important for the public to know that the gunman 's actions ca n't be linked with autism spectrum disorders , said dr. @entity109 , a pediatric neurologist and autism expert at @entity111 in @entity112			1
" aggression and violence in the @entity116 population is reactive , not preplanned and deliberate , " he said			2
for example , sometimes children with autism will get violent because they are sick or frustrated and unable to communicate how they feel			2
@entity109 also said that violence among autism spectrum disorder patients is " sometimes due to @entity116 features such as desire for sameness but usually related to a co-existing disorder such as anxiety or @entity126 ( attention - deficit hyperactive disorder )			1
" commenters and @entity0 @entity129 also weighed in on the issue			0
" i have @entity13 's , a very mild form of autism , " said one comenter , oblivion328			2
" though as an adult i no longer exhibit any of the associated behaviors aside from some manageable social anxiety , i recall very well having tantrums as a child			0
i sincerely doubt if you put a gun in my hand during such an episode i 'd start shooting people			0
most autistics are more likely to harm themselves than anyone around them really			0
" " when you talk about autism or anything on the autism spectrum , you 're talking about a neural disorder , " said @entity0 's dr. @entity150			1
" i think the terms do matter here			0
second of all , just this whole idea that it 's linked with violence in some way and specifically pre-planned violence , i think we can dispense with that			2
" what concerns advocacy groups such as @entity62 , the @entity43 and the @entity165 is that linking autism with violence will once again stigmatize people with autism and turn back the clock on progress made so far			1
" please do not judge any individual with autism based on what is being said about a killer of innocent children and teachers , " the @entity43 said in its statement			0
a blood test for autism ? @entity61 said he is concerned that linking autism to this crime could even endanger innocent people and that the community will begin to fear those with autism			0
" we worked so hard to try ( integrate them ) into our communities , give them opportunities to be employees , to be able to live in our neighborhoods , and if people do jump to conclusions , we really risk taking significant steps backward for people in this population , " he said			0
in a statement , @entity199 initiative director @entity198 said , " the autism community has long labored toward building understanding , awareness and trust within communities throughout the @entity86 and the world			0
" as adults with autism living productive , peaceful lives , we urge the media and professionals who participate in speculative interviews about the motives of the accused shooter to refrain from misleading comments about autism and other neurodevelopmental disabilities			1
... ( m ) isinformation could easily trigger increased prejudice and misunderstanding			0
" @entity0 's dr. @entity150 and @entity222 contributed to this report .			0
