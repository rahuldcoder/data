-- unsolicited text messages from scammers , companies and political campaigns are illegal and annoying			0
but at least now they 're easier to report			0
recently all of the major @entity8 wireless carriers have deployed a centralized spam - reporting service backed by @entity10 , a global association of wireless carriers			1
this service collects information about spam complaints from all participating carriers into a common database , which may make it easier for carriers to identify spammers and take action against them			1
according to @entity10 , one feature of the new spam - reporting service is that it generates a data feed of spam reports that carriers can integrate into their network security measures			1
it may be hard to tell whether this new system does any good			0
but it probably ca n't hurt			2
here 's how it works : when you receive a spam text message on your phone , forward that text to the shortcode 7726 ( which spells " spam " )			1
you 'll then receive an automated message from your wireless carrier , asking you then to enter the phone number from which the spam text was sent			1
i first reported as spam a text message i received from the @entity48 presidential campaign			1
( to be clear , the @entity48 campaign did not spam me			2
i voluntarily signed up to receive its text updates			0
however , i had to test this spam reporting service with somebody 's text message , and i doubt that one spam report would do @entity48 much harm			1
) the @entity48 campaign sends texts from a common shortcode ( a short telephone number that 's leased by the @entity61 government for texting programs -- a use that is highly regulated )			0
so when i responded to @entity64 with the sender 's phone number , i received a response that said : " it is likely that your message came from a shortcode			0
please return to the original message and reply stop			0
" ok , this might sound like the new spam reporting service did n't really do anything -- but actually it probably did the right thing			1
in the @entity61 , any texting campaign that uses a shortcode has to obey strict rules			2
one of those rules is that if you reply " stop " to any message that came from a shortcode , it has to stop sending you messages			2
many mobile users do n't know this , so this is a good reminder first to try to unsubscribe			0
and also , it verifies that my test did n't do @entity48 's campaign any harm			0
but many text - spam messages are sent from regular phone numbers , not shortcodes , precisely because shortcode use is so tightly monitored and regulated			1
organizations that disobey @entity61 shortcode rules can find their shortcode lease revoked , or their messages blocked by carriers			1
next i tested the spam - reporting service by forwarding to it a spam text i had received from an ordinary phone number			1
it claimed to be offering a @entity111 gift card , but that was most likely a ruse			0
after i got @entity64 's acknowledgment of my spam report and sent it the full 10 - digit phone number of the spam sender , the system responded : " thank you , we appreciate your assistance			2
" it also offered @entity64 's instructions for blocking text messages from a specific number			0
this spam reporting service apparently does n't tell you whether any action was taken against the spammer you reported			1
so it 's a little unsatisfying in that regard			0
also , this service is new , so it 's unclear so far what kind of difference it might make in the fight against spam texts			2
however , forwarding spam texts to an easy - to - remember shortcode is a simple thing to do			1
so it might be a good idea to try using this service to report any spam texts that you receive			2
let 's hope it helps			0
