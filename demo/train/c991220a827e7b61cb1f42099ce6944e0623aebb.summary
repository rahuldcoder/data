do black people have a history ? there have always been doubters			1
in 1843 @entity5 , said by some to be the founding father of @entity8 scholarship and education , was asked by black minister @entity10 to share " some account of the origin of the @entity14 race			1
" of @entity14 , @entity5 replied , " there is no history , and there can be none			2
" to be outside of history in @entity5 's view , was to be in a permanent state of " barbarism , " without the benefit of @entity25 's civilizing influence			2
@entity5 's view is no throwback			0
take the 2007 example of then - @entity29 president @entity28 who , during a state visit to @entity31 , remarked : " the tragedy of @entity14 is that the @entity14 has not fully entered into history			1
" @entity28 deemed @entity14 a place unaffected by change and without a capacity for progress , and thus beyond historical analysis			0
neither @entity5 nor @entity28 was correct , of course			0
scholars of @entity14 and its @entity41 -- in the 19th century and today -- have refuted the notion that black people have ever existed outside of history			1
their studies explain the evolution of varied black cultures with complex political , economic and social pasts			0
african empires , we learn for example , were as ancient and as brilliant as any of @entity25			0
@entity52 has provided one response to these questions			0
but today it has critics			0
filmmaker @entity57 asked whether it was time to do away with @entity52 in his 2010 documentary , " @entity60			0
" @entity57 captured the controversy that surrounds who tells black history and by what terms			1
some critics suggest that a one month ritual is inadequate to the task			0
the hashtag campaign # 28daysarenotenough is being used to express the impossibility of exploring the entirety of the black past in one month 's time			1
but others go further , advocating that the month should fall victim to its own success			0
black history , in this view , is an established part of @entity8 history			1
relegating the subject its own month segregates @entity83 from the " we " in " we the people			1
" @entity52 grew out of a desire to make the black past visible			1
in 1926 , @entity89 - trained historian @entity88 sought to challenge the myth that black people were without a history			1
his platform was the @entity94 ( today 's @entity94 )			0
@entity88 's @entity94 created the @entity95 to promote research and writing on @entity14 and its @entity41 in an era during which much of the historical profession was indifferent to the subject			1
@entity88 began with just a week			1
he noted how in early february @entity8 celebrated the birthdays of @entity102 and @entity103 and deemed it @entity105			1
@entity88 's goal was to make history available to teachers , students and the public			1
the @entity112 movements fueled interest , so much so that by 1976 , the association expanded the national marking of black history to the month that we know today			1
to some degree , @entity88 's goals have been realized			2
black history is a major subject of research and writing , in mainstream as well as in historically black colleges and universities			2
this work reaches beyond educational settings , into popular culture			0
the recent historical films " @entity131 " and " @entity132 " grew out of long - standing scholarly interest in their subjects			0
still , as we face new frontiers of knowledge , @entity52 's ongoing importance is clear			0
. i learned this first hand while researching , with students at the @entity143 , the life of @entity145 , a free @entity14 @entity8 woman who chronicled @entity147 life in a unique photo collection			2
@entity145 's beautifully preserved , leather - bound photo albums from the 1890s are in our library			0
to bring her story to a broader public , we set our sights on @entity155 , the online encyclopedia			0
we got stuck , and through the @entity157 - in we learned that @entity8 subjects like ours are under - represented in @entity155			1
we did get @entity145 a page , but there was more work to do			0
this year , the @entity162 has partnered with institutions such as @entity165 's @entity164 to ensure that black people have a history , @entity155 style			1
and , last thursday night , a faculty - student team gathered in @entity164 's @entity170 to create some of those missing entries			0
black history is not a static subject			2
@entity88 's association will mark its 100th anniversary in 2015 as a thriving site for the production of new historical understanding			2
nor can black history be taken for granted			2
with the emergence of new learning resources and technologies comes the task of reasserting the relevance of @entity14 and its @entity41			0
@entity88 's vision stands the test of time			2
and his approach -- which we call @entity52 -- helps ensure that understandings of the black past extend beyond ivy - covered towers and into the lives of students , teachers and the world			1
the opinions expressed are solely those of @entity199 .			2

historian @entity88 created @entity105 to *highlight* the history and *achievements* of @entity8
some argue that relegating @entity83 to one week or month per year is too *constraining*
@entity199 : the month ensures " that understandings of the black past extend beyond ivy - covered towers "
