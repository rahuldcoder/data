-- lots of folks have sunday morning rituals -- church , pancakes , watching football			0
i turn to the wedding pages			0
every sunday , i open up the @entity9 to check out the wedding announcements			0
they call that " the sports section for women , " which is annoying , because it presupposes that , because i 'm a chick , ( a ) i do n't like sports and ( b ) i love weddings			1
to which i say , ( a ) i know what a hat trick is and ( b ) wedding invitations are just bills written in calligraphy			0
no : i check out the wedding announcements because i want to see how many women change their names			1
i am freshly gobsmacked every single sunday morning when i see that about half the women -- mostly under 35 , all women with careers , all women who chose to submit their announcement to the putatively liberal @entity9 -- are electing to give up their identity			1
@entity0 : what happily ever after really looks like what would @entity30 say ? she was a 19th - century suffragist who was the first @entity32 woman to revert to her birth name after marriage			1
she even had to chastise one @entity38 by writing to @entity39 , " a wife should no more take her husband 's name than he should hers			1
" @entity41 's followers -- women who refused to change their names upon marriage -- were called @entity44			1
today only about 20 percent of @entity32 women are @entity44			1
in other words , 80 percent of women change their identities -- i mean , names -- upon getting married			1
it makes me wish we were a more progressive country like ... @entity54			1
yes , @entity54 , where @entity56 women keep their names for life			1
so must women , by law , keep their names in @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , the @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 ... i could go on , but i really like the way they do it in @entity72			1
@entity0 : what it 's like to be 30 around the world there , people have two surnames -- their father 's and their mother 's			2
when they have a child , she receives the first surname from the father and the second surname is the first surname of the mother , and the parents choose whether the father 's or the mother 's surname goes first , although this order must be the same for all their children			2
if that was a bit confusing , it 's just because they use the metric system			2
think about it : what does the @entity103 do when they want you to disappear ? they make you keep your first name and change your last name			0
when someone illegally assumes someone else 's name , we say an identity 's been stolen ; when someone legally assumes someone else 's name , we say ... you 're married			2
let 's cut through the most platitudinous argument : " a family shares a name			2
" um , nuh - uh			0
did your grandmother have the same last name as you ? was she still your @entity122 ? conversely , does having the same last name mean you 'll always stay a family ? ask the @entity125 or the @entity126 or the @entity127 or ... what 's in a name ? you tell me ... would you want to lay down seven grand to buy a wedding dress from @entity133 ? ( @entity134 ? ) how about listen to a song from @entity136 , @entity137 or @entity138 ? ( @entity136 , @entity139 , @entity140 ) read a cover story on @entity142 ? ( @entity143 ) @entity144 an old film with @entity147 @entity146 ? ( @entity148 , natch ) or get your nightly news from @entity150 ? ( @entity151 ) @entity152 needs her surname like a fish needs a @entity155			1
( @entity155 ) and does the name @entity157 suggest an " extraordinary journey " ? ( @entity159 ) by the way , my wedding announcement was in the @entity9			0
when i submitted it , i wrote , " the groom is keeping his name			0
" the @entity9 did not publish that sentence			0
i guess they thought it was a typo			0

women 's names are *important* to their identities , writer argues
in @entity54 , @entity56 women by law keep their own name after marriage
so do women in @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , the @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67
buy a *cd* from @entity136 or @entity136 ; @entity138 or @entity140
