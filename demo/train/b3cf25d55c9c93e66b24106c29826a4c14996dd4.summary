during @entity1 's " @entity0 : @entity4 " coverage , we 've asked businesses to tell us how they balance the imperative for profit with environmental concerns			0
@entity9 , the ceo of @entity10 , tells @entity1 how he 's working to create a carbon neutral airline			1
@entity12 , @entity13 -- the aviation industry is often perceived as one of the bad guys in the climate change debate			1
as a mode of transport , flying is regarded as being particularly polluting because of the amount of fuel used at high altitude			0
and , it is estimated to be responsible for around 3.5 percent of global greenhouse emissions			1
@entity10 ceo @entity9 says it would be a mistake to let green initiatives in the airline industry fall by the wayside			1
the sector 's reputation was damaged further when it was excluded from the targets outlined in the @entity34 agreement , which was interpreted by some as an example of its disregard for the climate change issue			1
this is unfair because the industry has taken great strides to reduce its environmental impact			0
for example , over the last 30 years , it has achieved a 60 percent improvement in fuel efficiency			1
there is a great deal of research being undertaken by manufacturers into more efficient technologies and alternative fuels , while the @entity55 initiative aims to improve flight planning across @entity57 to rationalize the amount of time an aircraft is in the sky			0
practically everything we do in our everyday lives has a carbon cost attached to it , but aviation is an element that we believe has come in for an undue level of criticism , when in fact it is arguably working harder than most industries to address the issue of climate change			1
the reaction to this criticism from governments has been taxation			0
but making a special case of aviation fails to address the wider issues			2
aviation fuel is carbon taxed , but why is this tax not applied on other types of fuel such as electricity and gas ? the additional revenue that would be generated could be ploughed back into green energy schemes and help deliver heightened efficiencies that our industry is already investigating			1
punitive taxation , which is driving up the cost of air travel , will ultimately end up being absorbed by the operator or by passengers			0
this , coupled with the current economic downturn , represents a significant threat to progress in the aviation industry as it could lead to a stifling of innovation and development			1
meeting the challenge of climate change costs money -- modernizing fleets with more efficient aircraft comes at a price			2
as an industry which has been hit hard by the downturn , some of these initiatives could fall by the wayside			0
to allow this to happen would be a grave mistake			0
we identified climate change as one area where we wanted to set the standard in the industry , and as a new entrant to the market we have been able to build a commitment to carbon neutrality into the heart of our business operations			1
it was a consideration in our choice of the @entity130 as the model of aircraft in our 110 strong fleet			2
the 60 xr is the most fuel - efficient midsize aircraft in the world , something it achieves by being built with light and strong modern materials , and flying higher and faster than other aircraft			2
it 's a perfect example of a win - win solution			0
we burn less fuel ; our customers enjoy lower pricing			0
aircraft positioning is another important consideration that has an impact on the amount of fuel consumed ; our fleet is based all across @entity57 , to reflect where our clients are			2
the positions of our aircraft are carefully planned and managed so that the number of " over flights " -- that is legs where the aircraft is empty -- are kept to an absolute minimum			0
we wanted to be 100 percent carbon neutral from launch so we partnered with @entity161 , one of @entity57 's most experienced providers of carbon offsets , where each project is rigorously audited and monitored for quality			1
by comparison , under the @entity57 emissions trading scheme , which does n't take effect until 2012 , commercial airlines will only have to offset 15 percent of the carbon emissions they create			1
with the impact of aviation on climate change being widely reported , people are more conscious than ever about their carbon footprint when using air travel			1
while the overwhelming majority have not changed the amount they travel because of it , it is certainly becoming a more important consideration and people are asking more questions before traveling			0
we have found that our attitude towards mitigating the effect our business has on the environment has actually become a business benefit			0
our competitive pricing structure includes a carbon offset charge , which is passed on , in its entirety , to @entity161			2
by acknowledging our responsibilities in the area of climate control and putting tangible measures in place , we have received considerable positive feedback from clients and business partners			0
we believe that @entity10 is at the forefront of modern @entity57 business			2
if every company in @entity57 could run 100 percent carbon neutral , as @entity10 does , the world would be a better place .			1

@entity10 has *teamed* up with @entity161 to become carbon neutral
airline chose fleet of @entity130 xr partly because of its fuel efficiency
aviation industry is responsible for 3.5 percent of global carbon emissions
