hours after a lone gunman murdered 20 school children in @entity3 , @entity4 , last december , president @entity0 took a vow			1
" we 're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this , regardless of the politics , " he said			0
in the year since the @entity3 , gun control advocates have seen their primary legislative objective fall short in @entity13			1
they have , instead , turned to states in an effort that has yielded some success			2
officials in @entity4 released a report on monday summarizing the investigation of the @entity3 shooting , but whether it will advance the gun - control agenda is unclear			1
the school tragedy has faded further from the national conversation , especially in @entity26 where @entity0 has lost political clout following his reelection and everything going forward will be seen through the prism of next november 's congressional midterms			1
following the shooting , the debate in @entity26 centered on expanding background checks , which failed in the @entity35			1

and a number of states , such as @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity4 , put in place new background check limits as well as other measures restricting magazine capacity and types of firearms legally available			2
but other states , mostly controlled by @entity54 legislatures , took the opposite approach			2
for example , @entity56 pursued a so - called " nullification " law that would , in theory , make it illegal to enforce any federal firearms regulations in that state			2
looking for momentum both sides in the gun control debate remain energized and have vowed to continue to fight for their own priorities and to vociferously oppose the other			1
proponents of stricter gun laws still back @entity0 's calls for a new national status quo			1

it won majority support , but failed to gain the 60 votes necessary to break a @entity54 filibuster			0
" our job is to continue to apply persuasion and pressure , " said @entity86 , executive director of @entity87 , a group backed by outgoing @entity89 mayor @entity88 , who has spent millions backing gun - control candidates			1
for the nation 's most established group advocating stricter gun laws , expanding background checks from sellers with a federal firearms license to all purchases -- including private sales at gun shows -- is the one and only priority			2
@entity106 , senior national policy director for the @entity107 , noted that several states have passed background check bills , including @entity110			2
key to expanding the field of states enacting tougher gun regulations , @entity86 said , is highlighting that most gun murders in the @entity115 -- more than 11,000 in 2010 -- are not national events but killings that never make news			1
among those trying to create a grassroots effort to force change is @entity122 in @entity115			0
established one day after the @entity3 shooting , founder @entity123 said her group is the only one with an established grassroots network , one pushing for background check bills in states like @entity26 , @entity129 and @entity130			1
" there are a lot of states to look at in this next legislative session , " @entity123 said			2
@entity136 defense but to those who frame the argument around the @entity136 , @entity0 symbolizes an anti-gun liberal focused on taking away their constitutional right to self - defense			2
@entity143 , an official with @entity144 , criticized the president as the single biggest threat to the @entity136 , but added that gun owners are more motivated because of @entity0 's vow for new restrictions			1
the response of the @entity151 , the most visible gun rights advocacy group , to efforts to expand background checks is firmly rooted			0
" we will fight them every step of the way , " said @entity151 spokesman @entity155			0
when it comes to gun - control advocacy , " none of their proposals will make us safer , " @entity155 said			2
the @entity151 argues that existing laws should be enforced and that the @entity115 should improve mental health treatment rather than seek to restrict constitutionally protected rights			0
gun rights activists postulate that something like background checks would not have stopped many of the high profile mass shootings in recent memory where weapons were obtained legally , with a background check			0
groups advocating for stricter laws counter that hundreds of thousands of firearms sales have been stopped at the point of purchase because of a failed background check			0
one of the most common solutions to gun violence offered by @entity136 supporters is the phrase championed by @entity186 vice president @entity186			0
" the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun , " he has said			0
for schools , that means proposals for armed guards in every facility as well as other security measures			0
also key to preventing mass shootings and a priority in the near future , said @entity143 of @entity144 , is eliminating so - called " gun free zones , " places like schools where firearms are not allowed			0
they believe if teachers at @entity3 or office personnel at the @entity211 -- where a dozen people were killed in a mass shooting in september -- were armed , then they would never have been targeted in the first place because gunmen go after " soft " targets			1
" the first responders are the ones that have a gun pointed at them , " @entity143 said			0
for @entity143 , hand in hand with allowing more guns in more places is preventing federal intrusion -- especially through nullification laws that seek to stop federal interference in state gun rights			0
moreover , @entity143 said the group is working to help convince the @entity35 not to approve the @entity230 arms treaty signed in september by secretary of state @entity231			2
" we think we have the votes to stop it , " @entity143 said			0
gun rights advocates worry that the treaty 's recommendation to track gun sales would lead to a national database of firearms owners , what they fear to be a slippery slope away from gun confiscation , the ultimate second amendment rallying cry			0
political calculation the biggest chilling factor politically appears to be the successful recall elections of two @entity250 @entity249 earlier this year after they helped pass legislation enacting tougher gun measures			1
both were in @entity249 - leaning districts , which gun control activists illustrate as proof positive that the @entity136 is not a partisan issue			1
advocates for stricter gun measures point out that despite the recalls , the @entity250 law still stands			1
regardless of the setback in the @entity35 last spring , @entity106 said history is on the side of advocates of stricter gun measures , noting that it took years and multiple votes to finally pass the first background check bill			1
he noted that most public opinion polls show an overwhelming majority of @entity115 favor expanded background checks			0
" we do n't have to convince the country			0
we have to convince the lawmakers , " said @entity275 , executive director of @entity276 , the group founded by former rep. @entity277 , who was severely wounded in an @entity279 shooting			0
just as they lament one loss in recent months , advocates of stricter gun laws are also celebrating a victory , hailing the campaign win of @entity286 as the next governor of @entity288			0
" he actually won on it , " @entity106 said of @entity286 's platform that included gun control			1
the prospects for @entity286 to pass any gun control bills in the state remains in doubt , however , in a state that is largely rural and steeped in gun culture .			1

@entity3 shooting killed 20 elementary *students* , *jolted* the nation
@entity0 pursued tougher gun control measure , which *stalled* in the @entity35
@entity306 has shifted to states ; both sides in the debate are energized
