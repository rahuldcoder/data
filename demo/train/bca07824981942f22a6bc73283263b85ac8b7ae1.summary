@entity0 announced in a webcast tuesday			0
if it succeeds it will be the first time a spacecraft has landed on a comet			0
scientists say there are still a few more key decisions to take in the coming hours before a planned separation of the landing craft @entity17 from the mother ship @entity3 on wednesday			1
@entity17 , which has spent 10 years fixed to the side of @entity3 during the journey across the solar system , can not be steered once released			2
before tuesday 's announcement , @entity7 lander system engineer @entity22 told @entity1 that the orbiter @entity3 has to be in the right position to allow the craft to " free fall " on the correct trajectory to the chosen landing site			1
scientists are hoping the probe will help us learn a lot more about the composition of comets and how they react when they get close to the @entity36 weighing in at 220 pounds , it might be the size of a domestic washing machine but @entity17 is considerably smarter			1
it is equipped with an array of experiments to photograph and test the surface of @entity6 as well as finding out what happens when the roasting effect of the @entity36 drives off gas and dust			1
but first it has to reach the landing site -- and there 's a lot that could go wrong			2
@entity22 explained that hours before separation , @entity17 's on - board batteries are prepared and a fly wheel is started to give the probe stability on its journey to the comet surface			1
without the gyroscopic effect of the fly wheel there 's a danger that the lander could turn end over end , he said			0
to release @entity17 , wax over a latch is melted and the lander is automatically unscrewed			2
if it fails there 's a back - up plan			2
a pyrotechnic charge will fire and push the lander away at just the right speed to set @entity17 on the right course , @entity22 said			0
mission controllers then face a nervous seven - hour wait for @entity17 to reach the surface			1
the comet is so far away that a confirmation signal relayed from @entity3 , which remains in orbit around the comet , will take nearly half an hour to reach @entity82			0
the comet 's gravity is so weak that engineers have come up with ingenious solutions to keep @entity17 in place			1
at touchdown two harpoons fire out from the legs , a thruster on top of the craft helps push it to the surface and screws on each of the three feet help attach it to the comet			1
built by a @entity101 consortium , led by the @entity102 ( @entity103 ) , the landing probe has 10 instruments			0
if all goes well the first picture should be of the landing site taken by @entity17 during the final moments of descent , followed by a panoramic image from seven cameras on the top edge of the lander , @entity22 told @entity1			1
according to details on @entity7 's @entity3 website , sensors on the lander will measure the density and thermal properties of the surface , gas analyzers will help to detect and identify any complex organic chemicals that might be present , while other tests will measure the magnetic field and interaction between the comet and solar wind -- high - energy particles given off by the @entity36 @entity17 also carries a drill that can drive 20cms ( 8 inches ) into the comet and deliver material to its on - board ovens for testing			1
@entity22 told @entity1 that the landing is fraught with danger			0
@entity17 could hit a boulder or a crevice and tip over			0
however , mission scientists are already pleased with progress			0
@entity7 project scientists @entity138 said : " the orbiter will remain alongside the comet for over a year , watching it grow in activity as it approaches the @entity36 , getting to within 180 million kilometers ( 112 million miles ) in summer next year , when the comet will be expelling hundreds of kilograms of material every second			0
" it 's got an awesome profile -- the adventure of the decade - long journey necessary to capture its prey , flying past the @entity82 , @entity151 and two asteroids on the way , " he said			0
and science fiction writer @entity154 added : " this is science fiction made real in terms of the achievement of the mission itself , but @entity3 is also taking us a step closer to answering science fiction 's grandest question of all -- are we alone ? " what can we learn from comet landing ? how comet mission helps search for alien life what is a comet and what will @entity3 discover			2

new : scientists give first ' go - ahead ' for an attempted landing on @entity6
the landing craft @entity17 is about the size of a domestic washing machine
it is equipped with nine experiments *including* a drill to *sample* the surface and test in an on - board oven
the comet 's gravity is so weak that engineers have come up with ingenious solutions to keep @entity17 in place
