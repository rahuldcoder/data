-- a host of @entity2 is calling for the head of @entity5 secretary @entity4 over the troubled health care website rollout			1
thirty - three @entity2 members of @entity8 signed rep. @entity10 's letter to president @entity11 demanding that @entity4 be fired			1
but whether to sack her is not one of the questions we should be asking			0
the secretary spent 3 Â½ hours testifying before a congressional committee on wednesday about the awful mess that was the launch of the federal website intended to allow millions of @entity19 to sign up for health insurance under the @entity21			1
punctuated by moments of contrition and obvious frustration , her performance was intended both to signal resolve to the @entity19 people that getting the website fully operational was her principal priority and to shield the president from the slings and arrows of the many critics of @entity21 , who gleefully saw this as an opportunity to embarrass him and re-energize their efforts to derail the law			2
the news wednesday was replete with stories of @entity11 's sagging popularity , and one ca n't help but tie this drop , at least in part , to the problems with the rollout			1
so what is he , as our nation 's chief executive , to do ? should he heed those calls to demonstrate forceful leadership in a time of seriously flawed performance and fire @entity4 ? after all , the argument goes , something like this would not be tolerated in the business world			1
the consequences would be swift -- the person responsible for the mess would be fired			2
and did n't she admit in her testimony that she was responsible ? yes , she did			0
but here 's why the question of whether she should be fired is not the right one			2
@entity11 needs to keep his eye on the big picture			1
the issue is not @entity4 ' future , it 's what needs to be done to fix the mess			1
she has accepted responsibility and has specified a time frame within which she has said the dysfunction will be repaired			2
@entity11 should support the secretary fully in her efforts			1
it is much more important for the president in the long run to make sure that people can sign up for insurance coverage under the @entity21 than to finger a scapegoat and orchestrate a public beheading			0
the difference between forceful leadership and nuanced leadership is significant , and the context and circumstances should determine which -- or what blend of the two -- is appropriate			0
whatever momentary boost a " forceful " action might give the president in the polls would not justify the potential long - term consequences of firing a @entity102 member who arguably has served well in turbulent times			1
@entity11 said wednesday that he would take ultimate responsibility , acknowledging that the buck stops at his desk			2
two very tough questions , however , lie ahead : first , what should he do about @entity4 if the mess is n't a whole lot less messy by the end of november ? and second , what about his own political capital ? let 's reserve judgment on the first one until the end of november comes around			1
at this point , my guess is that if implementation of the website has n't improved very much , @entity4 will resign			1
regarding the second , it 's clear that @entity11 has a lot riding on getting the system to work " well enough			1
" it might not happen by the end of november , but it will happen			0
it 's not yet clear where the problem with rolling out the health care website really lies			2
why such a shambles ? early indications point in two directions : diffuse authority ( no one was really in charge of the whole initiative ) and poor execution ( the contractors simply dropped the ball )			0
as we learn more about how the website was designed and tested , we will be in a better position to figure out what went wrong and where			2
but for the time being , we do n't know -- so why drop the guillotine blade and run the risk of beheading the wrong person ? the problem is real , and so are the politics			0
precisely because the @entity21 is so important to the president , its detractors see a golden opportunity to inflict possibly serious damage on its future			0
this is political hardball on steroids , and the grandstanding that we see in front of the cameras helps us understand -- as if we did n't already -- why 74 % of @entity19 polled are unhappy with the behavior of @entity8			1
calls to fire the secretary are intended to put @entity11 in the position of seeming weak if he does not			1
so he needs to respond in a way that is seen as decisive yet supportive of the secretary			0
the rearview mirror on the health information exchange mess is n't quite in focus yet , because we 're still in the middle of it			0
but it 's true that little changes tend to have small ripple effects , and big changes , like the health care act , have huge ripple effects			0
and no change , little or big , is ever without a glitch			0
life in @entity179 is a circus			0
there are many rings with different events going on in each , and all are vying for the audience 's attention			0
if the circus is to continue , the most important job is to know where the tent poles are and guard them zealously			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			2

many *republicans* want @entity11 to fire @entity4 over website dysfunction
@entity194 : the issue is not her future , it 's what needs to be done to fix the mess
he asks : is short - term boost in polls for @entity11 worth firing a @entity102 member ?
@entity210 : we are seeing political hardball and grandstanding on steroids
