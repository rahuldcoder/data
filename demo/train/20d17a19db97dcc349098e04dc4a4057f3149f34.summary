-- two years ago , a single conversation changed my life : my boss told me i needed to lose weight or kiss my job goodbye			1
actually , she did n't say that at all -- but it 's what i heard			1
in fact , she never used the words " fat " or " lose weight			2
" she never threatened my career			2
but when she said my clothes did n't do me justice , and that she wanted to send me to a stylist , i took a different message away			1
i took it to mean that if i did n't physically reduce my size i would no longer appear on @entity20 's " @entity19 , " where i have been a long - time contributor			1
tv is , after all , a visual medium , and everyone should look their best			2
so lose weight or lose your job is what i heard			2
i had been fat my entire life , trapped by it , but seemingly powerless to change			1
in retrospect , i was itching for an overwhelming reason -- short of a heart attack or @entity36 diabetes diagnosis -- to have to lose weight			2
the thought of losing a job i love was the spark i needed to get going			2
if you 've spent your life as a fat person , when you desperately do n't want to be , you know it 's like being in prison : you want to escape , but despite many efforts , you fail to make a break from behind those bars			1
i was fed up with allowing the shame of my weight to control many poor decisions -- from wearing navy on my wedding day to avoid looking like a massive marshmallow in a traditional white dress , to skipping all routine medical care for more than 10 years because i did n't want a lecture about my size			1
when i set about losing weight , i really did n't know how i was going to actually do it			1
but i knew one thing for certain : i was n't going to go on yet another diet			1
i had been there , done that			2
actually , i had tried pretty much every diet out there from @entity67 to @entity68 , cabbage soup to the @entity70			2
sure , i 'd lose some weight , but each and every time i 'd tire of the regimen , revert to old habits and gain it all back again			0
i came to conclude that diets simply pause bad behavior , and this time merely pausing was n't good enough			1
instead , my plan was fairly simple : eat less : ( duh ) , which i arbitrarily determined to be half what i used to eat			1
my little trick became if i could name everything i ate that day in under 10 seconds i was doing fine			0
choose better : for me , that meant cutting carbohydrates , which meant saying goodbye to a lot of white foods -- anything with flour , pasta , rice , potatoes and sugar			0
no cheat days : while many diets prescribe a weekly day off for good behavior , i knew that did n't work for me			1
i 'd wait until my cheat day arrived , eat every offender i could find , and before long i 'd be back to eating with abandon full - time			0
i now think that rewarding anyone trying to lose weight with a cheat day is akin to telling an alcoholic he can celebrate a month of sobriety with a beer			0
if i could handle moderation , i would n't have been fat in the first place			1
move more : this was the easiest of all , since i was n't moving at all			1
taking the stairs , walking to and from work and strolling around the block a few times a day evolved into a daily walk on the treadmill next to my bed			1
hold my self accountable , daily : i weighed myself every morning to always be aware of where i was			0
no more burying my head in denial			0
pause before binging : mindless snacking had always done me in			0
this time before eating , i stopped to think : preference or priority ? the preference may have been to go for the chips or cookies , but the priority was always to lose weight			0
just reflecting on that for a moment allowed to make the right choice			0
over the course of one year , using this simple plan , i lost 62 pounds			1
i 've since lost another 10 pounds			1
i came to learn that what i put in my head is far more powerful than what i put in my mouth -- and i 'm forever grateful to that boss who set me on this journey			0
when it comes to losing weight , no pill , potion or plan trumps patience and perseverance			0
that was the missing piece of the puzzle for me -- the steel bar that kept me from feeling the freedom to finally figure it out			0
in the past , i expected overnight results , and when i did n't get them , i stopped trying			1
i was successful professionally , with a loving husband and beautiful kids			0
but when it came to losing weight , i was a disaster , failing time and again because i lacked the right mindset			0
my message seems to be resonating with people who have fought long - time or life - time weight battles			2
i have gotten thousands of e-mails from people who say my story is their story -- that they , too , were lulled into complacency by one diet gimmick after another , only to lose a little and gain it all back			0
in this age of outsized @entity171 wins , many of us think that all you need to do to get rich is buy a lottery ticket			0
want to be the next @entity174 ? a few appearances on " @entity176 " will do the trick			0
we 're always looking for the quick fix , the easy out , to solve what ails us			0
the past does n't have to dictate the future			2
each of us has the power to change our mind for a happier , healthier , better life			1
anyone can make the shift			0
