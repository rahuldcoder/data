-- every syllable that could have possibly been uttered on @entity2 v. @entity3 , the latest offshoot of the demonstrably dopey @entity6 - fabricated " @entity5 " has already been said			1
so this post is not a reiteration of what every common - sense person knows , regardless of their party affiliation : first and foremost : @entity13 is a quiet hero , a woman of indomitable fortitude and the epitome of a proud and productive modern woman ; ( 2 ) president @entity18 's policies hurt women equally , if not worse than , all @entity20			1
( 3 ) whether they work in or out of the home , women have more contact with the real - world everyday problems the president 's policies have made worse -- from the rising cost of daily staples -- including but not limited to , energy , groceries and health care premiums -- to the plummeting value of their homes and retirement , to a job - stifling recovery with the velocity of a belly crawl			0
@entity2 : @entity13 and working moms and the liberal @entity41 philosophy has long been exposed : @entity43 feminism is not -- and never has been about -- promoting and effectuating policies that provide options and opportunity for all @entity20 women ; it has always been about divisive identity politics and mindless , spineless group think			1
what has been less explored is how @entity18 @entity51 and apparatchiks lack a fundamental ethic of good campaigns , ( not to mention , good people ) : loyalty and dare i say it ... fairness			1
there are plenty of vicious , hateful , vacuous liberals who regularly vomit venomous , vile diatribes against anyone remotely associated with a conservative thought			0
@entity2 is not one of those liberals			2
high ranking among those kind of loudmouth liberals are some of her " @entity74 " comrades who drop - kicked her under an 18 - wheeler for uncharacteristically using poorly chosen punditry one - tenth of 1 % as egregious as their putrid hourly utterances			0
opinion : not another @entity76 @entity2 is a liberal to be sure , but in my work with her on @entity0 and when she is a substitute host for @entity80 on our radio show , " @entity83 , " she is consistently a civil and articulate advocate of her philosophy			2
she has even been known to concede a capitalist point now and then ! @entity2 is a big girl and knows politics ai n't beanbag , but she deserved some face - saving space and time to come to the only right conclusion -- to apologize to mrs. @entity13 for saying she " had never worked a day in her life " -- which were she her own client , she would have demanded immediately , as she is one smart cookie			1
yet before the commercial break , the @entity18 high command was in high dudgeon			2
let 's do a little exercise in decoding @entity18 - world : have you ever seen them horsewhip a blundering man with the ferocity they laid into @entity2 ? a bit of irony in the @entity5 world , no ? just for comparison 's sake to make my point about the character of an operation , when i made a notoriously stupid blunder ( one of too many to count ) in the @entity108 campaign , and the chattering classes ' hairs were ablaze demanding my immediate tar - and - feathering , president @entity108 himself called me and told me to keep fighting , and to make just a tad fewer wild throws ; he put out the word that our own staff was to lay off			1
this is all insider stuff , and likely of little interest to the wider @entity0 audience , but here is the point , which every political veteran will recognize : the character of a campaign flows from the top ; it is a reflection of the values of the leadership			0
while relentlessly extolling how caring and fair it is about every last citizen , when it came to its own foxhole sister , the @entity18 team showed its true character			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity148 .			0

@entity51 *strategist* @entity2 said @entity13 had never worked a day in her life
@entity2 apologized , and @entity18 campaign *quickly* *dissociated* itself from her remarks
@entity148 : @entity2 right to apologize , but ferocity of campaign *response* *excessive*
she says @entity158 should have given @entity2 time to apologize on her own
