@entity0 , @entity1 -- on the surface , @entity0 , the capital of economic powerhouse @entity1 , is one of the most impressive cities in @entity7 : sprawling and prosperous , hi - tech and self confident			1
but eight times a year , the traffic comes to a halt and crowds disappear from the streets as an eerie wail resounds across the city : the sound is a siren , and this is the minbangui , or civil defense exercise , designed to drill the population against a possible strike			2
@entity0 is a metropolis that lives in the gun sights of @entity24 , one of the most dangerous states on the planet and just 40 miles ( 64 kilometers ) north of downtown , yet @entity0 residents have learned to live with the threat			1
in recent years , @entity24 provocations -- nuclear tests , missile firings , naval clashes -- have been more a subject for conversation in barbeque restaurants and late night pubs than lifestyle changers			1
financial markets are barely moved by the latest threats ; nobody is digging bunkers among their backyard kimchi pots			0
a blas√© attitude has infiltrated the public consciousness after six decades of living with the @entity24			1
on tuesday that attitude was rudely shaken after @entity24 shells slammed into the @entity1 island of @entity49 in the @entity50			1
the sight of columns of smoke rising from an artillery strike sent a frisson of real fear through this city of 12 million			1
it was the first such attack since the @entity59 ended at midnight , july 27 , 1953 , and @entity0 itself lies in range of massed , long - range @entity24 artillery dug into the @entity64			1
streets were jammed with traffic , as the news broke and people headed home to join families			0
companies sent emails urging staff to remain calm			0
a @entity75 diplomatic dinner was half empty , as invited government officials on stage two alert -- one being the lowest level , four being war footing -- were obliged to remain at their stations			0
" when i got home , the family discussed what we would do if war breaks out , " said @entity83 , a @entity0 - based accountant and mother of two			1
" this was especially shocking as it came after the @entity93 incident			0
" in march , the @entity93 , a @entity1 warship , was sunk in the @entity50 with the loss of 46 lives , indicating a dangerous new level of aggression by @entity24			1
the isolated state is currently in the midst of a leadership succession process			0
in the words of @entity24 expert dr @entity104 , incoming leader @entity105 has to prove to his generals that , " ... he is not a spoiled brat who spent his childhood eating @entity112 pastries , but a tough leader -- a warlord in the making			2
" that was certainly the impression @entity0 residents got on tuesday			1
" i had never seen @entity1 buildings burning like that -- this was @entity123 on @entity124 , " said @entity118 , a reporter at a leading daily			0
" it was kind of incredible , but then my reaction was this has been going on for half a century			0
i had forgotten that we live in a country at war			0
" the @entity59 , which ended with a truce rather than a peace treaty , is a distant memory for most @entity132 : few know the details of the savage street combat that racked their city , or the fact that the capital changed hands four times			1
the only remaining signs of combat are the bullet and shrapnel damage in the masonry of ancient palaces , for most of the city has been built and rebuilt			0
it is easy for the younger generation to overlook these scars , and the prominent @entity152 military garrison -- headquarters of the 27,500 @entity152 troops still stationed here as insurance against another invasion -- at @entity157 in the very heart of @entity0 , is now an established part of the cityscape			2
and whether the @entity93 and @entity162 incidents will permanently change attitudes is uncertain			0
" normally when the @entity24 misbehave , people do n't care , but yesterday , people got nervous , " said @entity164 , a 13 - year expatriate and author of a @entity0 guidebook			1
" people tend to get very angry , but then they settle down -- it is easy to get jaded			0
" but with the memories of one of the century 's most devastating wars seared into their memories , the old generation can not forget			0
" for me this is nothing new , " said @entity177 , a retired artist who lived through -- and painted -- the @entity24 occupation of @entity0 in 1950			1
" but it is kind of problematic that young people today are unconcerned about the danger of war			0
" the 20th century @entity59 lasted three years and killed -- estimates vary -- between two and four million			2
a 21st century @entity59 is likely to be shorter but , with @entity186 possessing nuclear weapons , even deadlier			2
and while @entity0 in 1950 was a city that few people in the wider world had heard of , modern @entity0 has tremendous international relevance as the capital of the world 's 13th largest economy			2
were it to come under artillery or nuclear attack , the tsunami that would sweep through global financial markets could be devastating .			2

although no *strangers* to @entity24 hostility , @entity0 residents see this attack as different
the sight of columns of smoke rising from an artillery strike sent a frisson of real fear
it was the first such attack since the @entity59 ended at midnight july 27 , 1953
@entity0 itself lies in range of massed , long - range @entity24 artillery
