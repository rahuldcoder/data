the bogey - free feat means @entity2 is the first player to complete 54 holes at the @entity11 course without dropping a shot			1
@entity2 's third round score of 65 also helped him streak past overnight leader @entity14 , who carded a 73 to slip four shots back and into a tie for fourth place			1
the @entity18 has been playing with yellow and affixed to his cap as a mark of respect to the victims of the fatal ferry accident in the waters off the south coast of his home country			2

fourth - placed @entity14 had led the event over the first two days after knocking out a course - record 62 on thursday but the 26 - year - old @entity41 found the going much tougher after the cut			2
his sole birdie on saturday came on the seventh hole			2
@entity45 @entity46 will take a three - shot lead into the final round of the @entity45 after a 2 - under - par round of 70 in difficult conditions at the @entity51 in @entity52 saturday			0
the 23 - year - old @entity53 built upon the course record 62 he shot on friday and now sits three clear of second placed @entity55 of @entity56			0
play was made difficult for most of the day due to driving rain and strong winds			0
but a 15 - foot par - putt at the last ensured @entity46 , who has never finished higher than third at a @entity62 event , ended the day on 16 - under			0
elsewhere on the course , @entity64 's @entity63 shot a round of 67 to move into third position on 12 - under while @entity69 's @entity68 and @entity56 's @entity70 lie a shot further back on 11 - under - par. world number three @entity73 , meanwhile , who could replace @entity75 at the top of the rankings with victory this week , is 12 shots back in 21st position after a third round of 71 .			0
