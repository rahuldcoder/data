the @entity1 administration asked the @entity2 on friday to keep in place an @entity5 requirement that certain religious - affiliated groups cover birth control and other reproductive health services in their employee insurance plans			1
the high court was poised to decide whether to grant a temporary injunction sought by a @entity13 charity of nuns to delay the mandate , which carries fines for non-compliance			1
the @entity19 - based @entity18 and other non-profits had filed a lawsuit against the federal government , saying the contraception coverage requirement violates their moral beliefs and their religious liberty			1
justice @entity26 issued an emergency injunction on tuesday for the charity that cares for the elderly poor and sought a response from the @entity1 administration			1
the @entity13 - affiliated group submitted a rebuttal after the @entity32 submitted its brief			2
it is not clear how @entity26 will handle the matter ultimately , but one option would be to ask the broader court to weigh in			0
the appeal again thrusts the politically charged @entity5 , also known as @entity5 , into the national legal spotlight			1
president @entity1 's signature domestic initiative , ruled constitutional by the court in 2012 , became even more controversial this past fall during its flawed public rollout			0
the current case spotlights a major sticking point in the law over contraception coverage			0
the mandate was designed by the administration to give women employed at nonprofit , religious - based organizations -- such as certain hospitals and private faith - based universities -- the ability to receive contraception through separate health policies with no co-pay			1
5 things : obamacare and contraception a court ruling on this matter could ultimately impact dozens of religious groups and businesses that have mounted legal challenges in recent months			1
@entity64 the church and state issue now in the spotlight involves rules negotiated last year between the @entity1 administration and various outside groups to address the controversy over contraception			2
under the law , churches and houses of worships are exempt from the mandate			0
but other nonprofit religious - affiliated groups , such as church - run hospitals , parochial schools and certain charities must either provide no - cost contraception coverage or have a third - party insurer provide separate benefits without the employer 's direct involvement			1
organizations that choose to opt - out of direct coverage must sign a document certifying their religious objections , and the government would then require the outside insurer pick up the costs			2
" at that point , the employer - applicants will have satisfied all their obligations under the contraceptive coverage provision , " the @entity32 said in its brief with the @entity2			0
the @entity13 charity has " no legal basis to challenge the self - certification requirement or to complain that it involves them in the process of providing contraceptive coverage , " the government said			1
but the @entity18 and the entity that administers its insurance plans , @entity108 , both qualify for exemptions under the conditions in the law , the @entity32 said			0
but the groups raised objections in their appeal to the @entity2 that an exemption ultimately amounts to tacit approval of something that violates their religious and moral beliefs			2
contraception coverage would be provided by someone in the future -- and they oppose that			0
" the government demands that the @entity18 sign a permission slip for abortion drugs and contraceptives , or pay of millions in fines " for non-compliance , said @entity128 , senior counsel for the @entity129 , the group representing the nuns			0
" the sisters believe that doing that violates their faith , and that they should n't be forced to divert funds from the poor elderly and dying people they 've devoted their lives to serve , " @entity128 said			0
the @entity2 in march will take up a related challenge to the birth control mandate , when it hears arguments over whether some for - profit corporations should be exempt , again on religious liberty grounds			2
