@entity19 's side , who were the home team in the 150th league meeeting between the two @entity23 giants , should have taken an 18th minute lead when a fine flowing move resulted in @entity26 crossing from the left for @entity14 to score			1
however , the @entity29 midfielder just delayed his shot on goal , allowing @entity32 to come back and produce a goal - saving challenge in the area			0
@entity1 did eventually take the lead in the 29th minute , but the goal was shrouded in controversy			1
@entity39 's cross from the right was met by the head of fellow - @entity43 @entity42 , but the effort clearly brushed off the striker 's arm before finding its way into the net			1
@entity6 were struggling to cope with the pace of @entity1 's attacks and it was no surprise when the league leaders doubled their advantage two minutes before half - time			1
a long free - kick out of defense was headed down by @entity57 and @entity14 was on hand to crack home a superb shot on the half - volley			1
@entity1 were inches from making it 3 - 0 in the 47th minute when @entity6 again failed to deal with a long ball			1
@entity66 defender @entity65 slipped over when trying to deal with the danger , allowing @entity42 a free run on goal			1
however , the striker fired just wide with @entity57 unmarked in the area begging for the ball			0
@entity73 had a quiet match for @entity6 and the @entity76 midfielder was eventually substituted in the 55th minute for @entity77 , seemingly holding a hamstring injury			2
the chances kept coming for @entity1			2
on the hour mark the superb @entity57 was denied by a brilliant reflex save from goalkeeper @entity82			0
however , against the run of play , @entity6 gave themselves hope with a 71st minute strike			2
@entity88 produced some @entity43 magic to lay a delightful ball through for @entity91 on the left -- and the @entity93 layed a simple pass square for @entity95 to find the corner of the net			0
that goal brought @entity6 to life			2
@entity77 had a shot well saved by goalkeeper @entity101 and the same player then headed home a @entity95 cross , but the linesman correctly flagged for offside			0
the longer the game went on , @entity95 began to have more influence , and the teenager nearly levelled for @entity6 in the 78th minute but @entity101 did well to save with his feet			2
then , in the final minute , @entity77 again went desperately close , producing another fine save from @entity101 as @entity1 held on for a classic and vital victory			0
meanwhile , @entity114 's title hopes were dealt another blow as they were held to a 1 - 1 home draw by @entity117 -- meaning @entity119 's side have now won just one of their last four matches			1
the visitors took a 10th minute lead when @entity125 was left unmarked to score from a pass from @entity127			0
the home side dominated proceedings but could only score once when @entity130 headed home a @entity133 cross in the 62nd minute			0
despite plenty of chances , the hosts could not find the winning goal , with @entity138 ( twice ) and @entity139 hitting the woodwork			0
elsewhere , @entity141 held on to fourth spot and the final @entity144 qualifying position as they remarkably came back from 3 - 0 down at @entity145 to snatch a 3 - 3 draw with @entity148 's equalizer deep into injury time			0
@entity150 , who had won 10 of their previous 13 matches , drop to sixth after they were well beaten 3 - 0 at @entity153 , for whom @entity154 scored twice .			0
