-- so this is @entity2			0
a coquettish @entity3 , rocking a sexy version of his traditional red suit while doing his best @entity7 " @entity8 " pose			1
the wide - mouthed blowup doll was erected outside a mall in @entity11 , the capital of @entity14 's northern @entity13 province , to appeal to shoppers and tourists			1
@entity20 's face , like some other displays around the world , is n't entirely what the holiday season is all about and certainly rather extreme			0
@entity14 is n't @entity22 , for example -- a country in which you 'd expect to find yourself caught up in the @entity2 spirit			1
but not unlike other parts of the world , every november many shopping malls , hotels , restaurants and other commercial venues across @entity14 coat themselves in a sugary sweet layer of beautiful and occasionally unusual trees , festive light displays and other holiday kitsch			2
and they can come by the decorations cheap thanks to the @entity14 city of @entity43 , often called " @entity47 " for the high number of factories producing holiday decorations that are exported globally			0
though there are reports @entity51 is on the rise in @entity14 , it would n't be accurate to say most ordinary @entity14 equate @entity2 with religion or the celebration of the birth of @entity56			2
it 's not a public holiday in @entity14 so all businesses and schools remain open on december 25			1
that has n't stopped many locals from buying into the gift giving and party traditions of the season			0
it 's a trend retail outlets are more than happy to cater to , piping @entity2 music through speakers and laying on the tinsel to get shoppers in the mood to spend			0
if you really want to enjoy the season , there 's no @entity2 theme but @entity14 's most wintery attraction is the annual @entity78 and @entity79			1
though it does n't officially kick off until january 5 , many of the displays go up in mid-december and are open for visitors .			0
