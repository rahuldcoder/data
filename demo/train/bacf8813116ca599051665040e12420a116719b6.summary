-- " @entity3 , " director @entity1 's film about the 16th president and his battle to end slavery , rounded up plenty of votes for the 85th @entity9 , topping all films with 12 nominations , including best picture			1
@entity1 , one of the most successful directors in @entity15 history , does n't need the honors -- he has six previous directing nominations , including wins for " @entity19 " and @entity20 " -- but the showing marks a return to dominance for the filmmaker			1
in the last decade , his films , including " @entity28 " and " @entity29 , " have received little more than respect at the annual gathering			0
along with the best picture and best director nominations , the film also earned nods for best actor ( @entity35 ) , best supporting actress ( @entity37 ) , best supporting actor ( @entity38 ) and best adapted screenplay ( @entity40 )			1
second in the nomination race was @entity43 's " @entity42 , " the story of a spiritually curious boy who survives a shipwreck and travels across the ocean , accompanied by a tiger named @entity49			1
" @entity54 , " based on the best - selling novel by @entity56 , earned 11 nominations , including best picture , best director and best adapted screenplay			1
" @entity59 " and " @entity60 " both received eight nominations , including for best picture			1
other best picture nominees are " @entity63 , " " @entity64 , " " @entity65 , " " @entity66 " and " @entity67			1
" some notable acting veterans , including @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 , were back in the academy 's good graces			0
@entity69 earned a best supporting actor nomination for " @entity60			1
" it 's his seventh nod and first since 1991 's " @entity76			0
" @entity69 has two wins , for " @entity78 " and " @entity79			0
" " i am very pleased that the academy has chosen to honor the many individuals who were a part of ' @entity60 , ' " he said in a statement			1
@entity84 received his sixth nomination , a best actor pick for " flight			0
" he 's also won twice , for " glory " and " @entity89			0
" and @entity71 , of " you like me ! you really like me ! " fame , is up for her third award , though her first in a supporting category			2
she won for " @entity96 " and " @entity97			0
" triumphs of youth and age there are also some young names on the list			0
perhaps none is so youthful as @entity105 , the star of " @entity63			2
" " beasts , " a magical - realist fable about a little girl and her father surviving the caprices of weather , emotion and civilization off the @entity119 coast , received four nominations : best picture , best director ( @entity107 ) , best actress ( @entity105 ) and best adapted screenplay			1
@entity105 , the film 's spark plug , was just 6 when filming started			0
now 9 , she still ranks as the youngest - ever nominee for best actress			0
" everyone who made ' beasts ' happen is so happy ! " @entity105 said in a statement			0
" thank you to all you @entity9 folks , from me , my mom and my dad			0
... @entity133 it ! " the film was a favorite at @entity137 and did well at the box office -- especially given its sometimes inscrutable narrative -- but few expected it to do so well at the @entity9			2
@entity105 was considered too young by some -- " sorry , @entity105 , but best actress @entity142 for @entity144 , " read a headline in the @entity146 -- and @entity107 's directing competition included @entity148 ( " @entity66 " ) , @entity149 ( " @entity67 " ) , @entity150 ( " @entity65 " ) and @entity151 ( " @entity59 " )			1
but when the nominees were announced , @entity107 , who 's 30 , was on the shortlist			2
another surprising nominee was " @entity64 , " the @entity156 film from director @entity157			2
@entity157 is well - known overseas -- his 2009 film " @entity159 " won the @entity160 at @entity161 as well as a @entity162 -- but if @entity164 audiences recognize him at all it 's for " @entity165 , " a 2007 @entity167 - language remake of his brutal 1997 thriller			2
" @entity64 , " about a husband and wife coping with the effects of a stroke and aging , received five nominations , including nods for picture , director , actress , original screenplay and foreign - language film			1
" @entity64 " star @entity181 , 85 , is the oldest nominee for best actress in @entity9 history			0
other best actress nominees are @entity185 ( " @entity67 " ) , @entity186 ( " @entity60 " ) and @entity187 ( " @entity188 " )			1
the nominees for best actor are @entity35 ( " @entity3 " ) , @entity191 ( " @entity59 " ) , @entity84 ( " flight " ) , @entity192 ( " @entity193 " ) and @entity194 ( " @entity60 " )			1
more @entity9 nominations , including best supporting actor , actress surprising snubs the love shown " @entity64 " and " beasts " meant that " @entity67 , " " @entity66 , " " @entity59 " and " @entity65 " all fell short of expectations , particularly in the directing category			1
" @entity67 's " @entity149 , " @entity204 and " @entity205 were all nominated for @entity206 , usually a sure sign of an @entity9 nomination , but all fell short with the academy			2
@entity149 's snub was particularly surprising , given that she and her film had dominated critics ' lists during awards season			1
the film , about an obsessive @entity218 agent pursuing @entity219 , may have been affected by controversy surrounding its torture scenes			0
some detractors suggested the scenes implied that torture contributed to the success of the operation			0
the film is still raising hackles			0
after its nomination for best picture , the @entity229 , a legal advocacy organization , released a statement in protest			2
" instead of awards , ' @entity67 ' should be earning condemnation for falsely suggesting that torture played a role in the capture of @entity219 , " the group said			0
the lack of nominations for @entity150 was also surprising			1
when " @entity65 " was released in october , it looked like it was going to be the actor - director 's year			1
" before november , the nominees ( for best picture ) would have been ' @entity65 , ' ' @entity65 , ' ' @entity65 , ' ' @entity65 , ' ' @entity65 ' and ' @entity65 , ' " wrote @entity248 's @entity247			1
instead , though the film received seven nominations , @entity150 was left off both the directing and acting lists			1
he was recognized for the adapted screenplay , and he co-produced the film with @entity255 and @entity256 , so he 's on the best picture list -- but he 'll have to wait for the other trophies			2
@entity148 remains a critical and popular favorite -- " @entity262 " has grossed more than $ 100 million domestically in three weeks -- but he failed to impress the academy with his directing prowess			1
the movie , however , picked up best picture and best original screenplay nominations			2
( @entity266 , who directed " @entity60 , " earned the fifth slot in the directing category			1
) @entity148 is still better off than @entity269 , whose " @entity272 " picked up just one nomination , for original screenplay			2
voting rites the overlooked directors and other creative types -- such as the people of " @entity277 " ( five nominations , but none in major categories ) , " @entity281 : an @entity283 " ( three nods ) and " @entity193 " ( three nominations , but no love for the film or writer - director @entity288 ) -- can always blame the system			1
the academy 's voting process became more difficult this year with the addition of online technology that proved more complex than @entity294 's infamous butterfly ballot			0
according to industry news sites , the system contained so many safeguards that academy members found it difficult to cast their ballots			0
some voters were so frustrated they visited the academy headquarters in person on the last day of voting -- friday , extended one day because of the issues -- to make sure their votes were recorded			2
" next year i 'm signing up for a paper ballot , " one academy voter told @entity310 's @entity309			0
but the system did shine on one unexpected recipient : " @entity318 's " @entity314 , who 's hosting the @entity9 show and co-hosted thursday 's nomination announcement with @entity317			0
he got a nomination for co-writing one of the original song nominees , " everybody needs a @entity320			2
" " i guess i 'm going to the @entity9 , " he cracked			0
the rest of the nominees might want to take lessons from the nomination leader			0
after all , it 's no surprise a movie about a politician knows how to count votes			0
the 85th @entity9 are scheduled for february 24 on @entity333			1
the show will air from the @entity335 -- formerly known as the @entity335 -- in @entity336			0

" @entity3 , " " @entity42 , " @entity65 " and " @entity60 " are among best picture nominees
" @entity63 " has surprising showing -- four nominations
@entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 overlooked in best director category
