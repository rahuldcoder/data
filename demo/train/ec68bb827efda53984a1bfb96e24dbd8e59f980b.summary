" but nobody at the @entity14 is pushing back on it either , the source added			1
" as far as i know , she 's here to stay ... this too shall pass , " the source said , pointing out that it would not make much sense to try to force @entity3 out just two months before the midterm elections			1
" it 's not like we 're about to dump her , " the source added			2
however , the source said that when the president wants to talk about midterms , he usually reaches out to senators associated with the @entity29 ( chairman @entity30 , @entity31 and former chairman @entity32 ) and that committee , not @entity3			0
