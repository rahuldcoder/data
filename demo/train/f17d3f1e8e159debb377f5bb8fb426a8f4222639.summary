@entity0 , @entity1 -- two @entity3 were sentenced to death thursday in @entity5 , the @entity6 said , after what a human rights group called a " military show trial " that relied on evidence obtained through torture			1
@entity12 , 28 , who is also a @entity13 citizen , and @entity14 , 29 , were convicted of murder , attempted murder , criminal conspiracy , armed robbery , and espionage , according to @entity13 legal charity @entity20			1
both men have maintained their innocence			2
@entity3 and @entity13 said thursday they remain opposed to the death penalty and offered support to the men			1
the two men traveled into @entity5 from @entity28 on a motorbike trip in april 2009 , @entity26 said			1
when their bike broke down in @entity32 , they hired a car and a driver , and two @entity5 passengers joined them , the group said			1
several hours into the journey , in the middle of the rainforest , the driver was shot and killed , @entity26 said			0
authorities allege @entity41 and @entity14 killed the driver , but both men maintain they were ambushed by gunmen			2
afraid for their lives , they fled into the dense jungle , @entity26 said			0
they were arrested separately in may 2009 , the group said			0
they were first sentenced to death last september			1
they lost their appeals but the @entity53 in @entity54 quashed the sentences in april and sent the case back for a retrial , @entity20 reported			0
@entity26 said there is no physical evidence against the men and the two witnesses who testified against them were given large sums of money in compensation and have changed their stories " countless " times			2
the prosecution has also referred to statements obtained through torture , @entity26 said			1
" this farce of a trial would be comical if the stakes were n't so tragically high , " said @entity70 , the deputy death penalty director at @entity20			2
" each time the military prosecution changes their theory , the witnesses all obligingly change their story			0
" @entity70 urged the @entity13 and @entity3 governments to press @entity5 to provide a " credible civilian trial " for @entity41 and @entity82 and arrange for their repatriation			1
a spokesman for the @entity6 told @entity2 the death sentences will not take effect until both men have exhausted their appeals			2
" @entity3 is a strong opponent against the death penalty , and we have been communicating this stance to the relevant authorities , " said spokesman @entity87			1
" we have received assurances from the authorities that the death sentence wo n't be carried out and we hold the authorities responsible for the well being of these two			0
" @entity3 has told @entity5 it wants to transfer both men to @entity3 , but it 's not clear under what conditions that can take place , @entity87 said			1
@entity13 's @entity101 said it was " extremely disappointed " that @entity41 was sentenced to death			1
" we will be doing everything we properly can to support him in the coming weeks and months , " said a spokesman , who declined to be named in line with policy			0
" we are committed to supporting any @entity13 national who faces the death penalty and our prime concern in this case is to ensure that no execution is carried out			0
" @entity13 has made its concerns clear to the @entity5 government , the spokesman added			1
@entity26 said prosecution evidence includes photographs of two guns alleged to have been found on @entity14 's computer , but both guns have been traced to @entity3 and have never left @entity3			1
the prosecution claims the maps , compass , and gps system they were carrying proves they were spies , @entity26 said			0
after his arrest , @entity41 was beaten , subjected to a mock execution , and forced to sign a confession , the group said			0
the trial was held in @entity41 , a language neither man speaks , and no interpreter was provided for a large part of the trial , @entity26 said			0
" for those hearings where an interpreter was present only a small part of what was said was translated , and even then mistakes were constantly made , " the group said			0
" @entity12 said that when he told the court he worked in security , the interpreter translated it as he worked as a spy			0
" @entity26 said the men are also being tried in military courts , in violation of @entity5 's constitution , which says such courts may only handle cases involving the military or police			2
@entity3 authorities deny that the two men , who are former soldiers , were ever involved in spying for @entity3 , @entity26 said			2
@entity2 's @entity156 contributed to this report .			0
