-- wild horses , raging winds and energy - sapping heat in the land of @entity5 ; welcome to the @entity7 steppe			2
this vast expanse of savannah and grassland is the setting for the world 's longest horse race -- the @entity14			1
equestrian 's toughest test is perhaps the last place you 'd expect to find a teenager from the @entity21 county of @entity22			1
but @entity23 is n't like other teenagers			1
the 19 - year - old is the youngest winner -- and first female victor -- in the five - year history of this most arduous of contests			1
" it is the most extraordinary and bizarre race , it 's like the @entity35 crossed with @entity36 , " @entity23 told @entity0 from a victory party in the @entity7 capital of @entity32			1
" it was really dramatic , it would be first - degree heat and the horses would be sweating , then suddenly the air would cool with wind blowing super hard			2
" i wanted to do something that was going to put me out of my comfort zone i guess			2
@entity7 sounded like a really cool country			2
" the race , officially recognized by the @entity48 in 2011 as the world 's lengthiest , takes its inspiration from the @entity52 's pioneering postal service			1
the fearsome @entity5 , leader of the @entity7 between 1162 and 1227 , established and expanded the " @entity53			2
" it was a messenger system which saw riders travel on horseback between outposts , stopping to either rest , swap horses or pass the message onto another rider			0
forty horse stations , " urtuus " to use the @entity7 name , line the race 's 1000 - kilometer route			1
not that there is a course set out for the 30 competitors , who use anything from a compass , gps or good old - fashioned intuition to traverse the landscape between each resting spot			0
as the race 's official website puts it , " this is no guided tour , or pony trek			1
" each urtuus is manned by local nomads and furnished with tents , beds and food for man , woman and horse alike			0
riders must change horse at each urtuus			0
it is the nomadic tribes who provide the horses for the race and equine welfare is one of the organizers ' highest priorities			1
a vet is stationed at each urtuus and if the horse 's heart rate is above a certain level , the rider is given a time penalty			1
there is also extensive medical support for the jockeys , half of whom withdrew from the race before the finish line this year			1
" there were 30 at the beginning , but not at the end , " explains @entity111			0
" my body got really cross with me the day i finished , i slept all day			0
" i 'm lucky because i 'm young			0
any problems i had were really painful but did n't get that bad			0
i got really swollen ankles , chafing , a few other things , blisters and other stuff			0
" the worst thing is the exhaustion , sitting on a horse may look easy but you 've got to keep them cantering			0
thirteen hours a day i was on a horse			0
at lunchtime you 'd want to sleep but you ca n't because there 's another 120 kilometers to go that day			1
" prior - @entity23 's determination paid off , although her joy came at the expense of another rider 's despair			1
@entity135 @entity134 was the first rider to finish the race , but her horse failed a post-race medical inspection			2
a two - hour penalty ensued and prior - @entity23 was named as the winner			1
" it was a strange way to win and i did n't feel very good about it because the other girl was super upset , " said @entity111			0
" it 's slowly sinking in			2
" so what next for the teenager who made history ? the answer , it would seem , is more history			0
" i begin university in september , i 'm going to study history in @entity154 or maybe at @entity155 in @entity156 , i have n't decided , " she said			0
" it 's a terrible future for me because everything else is really boring			2
i 'll have to knuckle down with some work			0
