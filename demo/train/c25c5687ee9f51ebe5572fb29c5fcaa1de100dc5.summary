-- politicians struggle with reinvention after failure , and during the internet era , everything lives forever in the digital universe			0
some things simply can not be undone , no matter how hard we might try			0
buying a nice pair of black glasses , for instance , to suggest character and intellect will not prevent search engines from finding stories and videos of @entity19 gov. @entity18 's famous " @entity20 " moment during a nationally televised debate			1
although an entire nation either grimaced or laughed through his blunder , he will continue trying to portray himself as presidential timber , a leader who is as good at creating jobs as he is at inadvertent political humor			2
those new specs wo n't make a grand jury investigation go away , either			1
a special prosecutor in @entity32 has impaneled a grand jury to examine allegations that the governor of @entity19 may have bribed and coerced a key state official to force her out of office			1
at the time , her office was investigating one of @entity18 's signature projects , the @entity42 and @entity41			1
( watchdog group @entity43 filed the complaint with the prosecutors			0
) @entity46 , the @entity47 district attorney , oversees the @entity48 , which investigates possible corruption in state government			0
her office had launched the investigation of the multibillion - dollar cancer research agency after 18 scientists , including the @entity55 laureate director , resigned in protest			0
they had claimed that investment decisions for that organization were being made without proper scientific review and that tens of millions of dollars were ending up in the hands of @entity18 supporters and donors for their business ventures			0
one former executive of the agency had been indicted in connection with an improperly awarded $ 11 million grant , and the case is pending			0
and then @entity46 was arrested for driving while intoxicated			0
@entity69 @entity18 demanded that @entity46 , a @entity70 , resign after a video showed her behaving belligerently and asking for favoritism during booking			0
when she refused to step down , he threatened to withhold her $ 7.5 million state funding , which she was using to pay for the cancer investigation			0
@entity46 would not accede to the governor 's demands -- she is a locally elected official -- and he followed through on this threat to veto the budget			2
the move to cut the funding for the state watchdog group had a few political benefits for the @entity19 governor			1
he had just eliminated money for a legal inquiry in which he possibly might have , eventually , been implicated			0
if she had quit , @entity18 would have also had the authority to name @entity46 's replacement , most likely a @entity69 , which then becomes a convenient way to avoid any potential charges or political damage in advance of a second @entity69 presidential run			2
a special prosecutor , @entity95 , was assigned to the case and has said he was " very concerned " about @entity18 's behavior			1
the governor has , consequently , hired a high - profile @entity32 criminal defense lawyer			0
@entity18 has not spoken publicly about the case , but his office is arguing that he was constitutionally empowered with a line - item veto and that he did nothing wrong			2
because he claims to have been acting in his capacity as governor , @entity18 plans to have his lawyer paid out of taxpayer funds			2
any attempts to characterize the investigation of @entity18 as a political prosecution are uninformed			2
@entity19 law is clear on official abuse of power : prosecutors would only need to show that @entity18 was offering considerations in return for actions by @entity117			1
if there is evidence of any additional conversations after @entity46 's original refusal and the formal veto , and evidence that @entity18 or his representatives attempted further negotiations for her resignation in exchange for anything , @entity95 's presentation to the grand jury could become more compelling in convincing members that @entity18 was coercing another officeholder			1
a @entity47 judge said it was communicated to him that @entity18 's representatives told @entity46 , even after the veto , that money for her office would be restored if she resigned , actions that could easily be interpreted as bribery or coercion by the grand jurors			1
the special prosecutor appears to have confirmed that he is looking at whether @entity18 's office made such potentially illegal representations by acknowledging that he is looking at everything " before and after the veto			1
" @entity18 's problems come at precisely the wrong moment in his reintroduction tour of @entity149 , and the legal tangle might harm his presidential profile worse than shutting down lanes of a bridge			1
in fact , the @entity19 governor 's actions , if proved by evidence , are worse than the @entity161 gov. @entity160 team 's traffic tricks because @entity18 might have obstructed justice , not just a thoroughfare			1
at least @entity160 has exhibited the basic sense to use his campaign funds to pay his $ 300,000 - plus in legal fees and not lean on the state 's overburdened taxpayers to fund his defense			0
the secrecy of grand jury proceedings are likely to prevent @entity18 from getting hammered in the media on every day , but his troubles quickly turn into good news for the emerging campaign of @entity176			1
neither @entity18 nor @entity160 has to be convicted of a crime for the former @entity179 governor to be viewed as the putative @entity69 front - runner for the 2016 presidential nomination ; they need only to have their reputations harmed			1
@entity160 is already battered , and @entity18 is just starting to take punches , which continues to prove there is still entertainment value in @entity149 presidential politics			2
just not much character or leadership			0
join us @entity192 / @entity191 .			0

@entity194 : @entity19 governor reinventing himself , but grand jury inquiry wo n't go away

he says @entity18 's troubles are good news for @entity176 in race for presidential nomination
