-- he was an outstanding talent who never made it in the @entity4 , before he established himself as one of the most famous @entity7 players in @entity9 basketball history			1
but basketball is just one of the many talents in @entity14 's locker			1
he 's a co-owner of a @entity17 restaurant where he also cooks			2
@entity14 has come a long way since he had a dream of becoming a @entity7 basketball star			1
as he puts it : " everybody wants to go to the @entity4			1
" in 1988 , drafted in the third round by the @entity24 with the 68th overall pick , @entity14 appeared to have the world at his feet			1
but those feet could not dance their way past his new teammates -- the way was blocked			2
" i knew it would be difficult because the team that drafted me had too many good players , " @entity14 told @entity0 's @entity33 series			1
nicknamed ' future ' so @entity14 packed his bags , left the @entity7 and headed for @entity38 to begin a 25 - year odyssey where he would change clubs 15 times and play in five different countries			1
one of the most successful @entity7 to ever play in @entity9 , he was the @entity43 in the @entity17 league in 1992 , 1993 and 2000 and won the @entity45 with @entity47 side @entity46 in 2002			1
not bad for a man who did n't pick up a basketball until the age of 15			1
" when i first started i was playing as if i had two left feet , " he said			2
" i had to learn because everyone else my age was already playing			2
" i would stand on the side and dribble the ball by myself while everybody else was dunking and jumping			0
" that embarrassment was the driving force behind @entity14 's determination to succeed			1
instead of moping on the sideline , he began an intensive program of training to help propel him towards the top of the roster			2
he started to tape @entity4 games and take notes on the way players moved , which foot they jumped off and then tried to replicate those steps in training			1
each day he would get up and go to the park in the summer and play in the morning or practice by himself , sometimes playing for five different teams around @entity76			2
his extra work did not go unnoticed			0
nicknamed ' future ' by his high school coach , who clearly believed his student had talent , @entity14 began to fulfill his promise			1
@entity83 machine guns he won a scholarship to @entity85 and his draft to the @entity24 followed almost expectantly -- but that 's where it all began to unravel and he headed to @entity9			1
forget that he could n't even pronounce the names of half the teams his agent was suggesting -- he boarded a plane for @entity38 to embark on an adventure he 's still living			2
@entity14 readily admits he did n't know that they even played basketball in @entity38 , and when he touched down to be greeted by armed guards wielding @entity83 machine guns , he realized that he was entering a very different world			1
not that it seemed to bother him on the court			0
playing in @entity101 , a large city and a port on the @entity104 coast of southern @entity38 , he was voted @entity43 in 1988 and began to enjoy life after adapting to life away from home			2
" i had never left the @entity108 and being in @entity38 at that time was strange , " said @entity14			1
" the people was good to me but still , i was away from home , the food was different , they spoke another language , and i did n't know what they were saying			0
" the coach helped me a lot			2
he took care of me , treated me like family and that helped			2
normally that does n't happen in @entity76 -- the coaches just bring you into the team and you 're on your own			0
" @entity101 was the first stop on a tour which would take in @entity125 , @entity17 , @entity47 and @entity126			0
it was in @entity47 with @entity46 where @entity14 won the @entity45 in 2002 on top of four @entity47 league titles and two domestic cups			1
master chef further success followed in @entity17 with @entity133 where he won the @entity134 in 2007 some 12 years after helping @entity135 win two league titles			2
voted @entity43 in the @entity17 league three times during his career , it 's no real surprise that @entity14 chose to remain in @entity9 than return to the @entity7 he considers himself @entity9 , speaks @entity17 and while he continues to play at the age of 47 , he has turned his hand to a new love of his -- cooking			1
@entity14 co-owns a restaurant in @entity147 on the @entity104 coast , where he produces some impressive tasting cuisine			1
he can make a mean dessert and his big hands so used to the shape of a ball have become more delicate in their approach to rolling cannelloni			0
it was only when he arrived in @entity135 in the 1990s that he discovered he was just as capable of creating souffles as the was netting three - pointers			0
" my plan was never to be a chef or to cook but you need something else , you need a hobby , " he said			0
" that was a good hobby for me			0
i love to cook , i always cooked for my players			2
i go home to the @entity7 and cook all the time so i ended up just loving it			1
" every year , i go back to cookery school whenever i can and just try different things			0
" i 'm at the restaurant 10 hours a day and it 's good to see people come , eat something and love it			0
that 's a good feeling			0
" it 's like basketball -- people come to the game , you play , you do well and then after that , they congratulate you			1
it 's kind of the same			0
putting a smile on someone 's face			0
" @entity187 mentor now 47 , @entity14 knows he wo n't be putting smiles on people 's faces for much longer with a basketball			1
after an adventure which began in @entity38 over two decade ago , he is more likely to be found perfecting his apple pie or cheesecake rather than shooting hoops			0
not that he 's retired -- not yet			0
he still trains three days a week with @entity196 , a team which plays outside of the top league			0
now he finds himself giving advice to the next generation , just as he did with @entity201 , a former teammate who plays for @entity202 in the @entity4			1
voted an @entity4 all - star in 2012 and awarded the best defensive player of the year gong in 2013 , @entity201 first met @entity14 at @entity133			1
" when @entity201 first came to play with us he was overweight , " jokes @entity14			1
" but he definitely had something			0
" he came to our team in @entity133 and i liked him			0
he worked hard every day and i worked with him			0
" i beat him up every day , sometimes i hit him			0
he was about to fight me because i just love competing			0
" i love to make a guy get better and better and @entity201 was of those players i helped			1
i was very proud of him when he want to the @entity4 - he 's one of the best centers there			1
" while @entity201 has gone on to establish himself as one of basketball 's biggest names in the @entity7 @entity14 has no desire to return across the @entity219			1
now a ' grandpa ' figure to those he plays with , he is happy to spend the rest of his time by the tranquil waters of the @entity104 while basking in the @entity17 sun. " this is a great life , " he says			0
" the food is great , the food in the @entity108 , i 'm not too much crazy for anymore			0
" i do n't eat fried foods or fast foods			0
i 'm more @entity9 now - even the way i dress or talk			2
i just love it here			0
" raise a glass of @entity236 -- this is one odyssey which wo n't be ending any time soon .			0
