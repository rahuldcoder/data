@entity6 founder @entity5 , speaking to mobile tech leaders in @entity1 , said @entity2 , the mobile messaging app purchased by the social media giant last week , was " worth more than $ 19 billion			1
" @entity5 's comments at @entity8 , referencing the eye - watering price paid for @entity2 , were met with surprise			1
but @entity5 said the company was " a great fit for us			2
already almost half - a - billion people love using @entity2 for messaging and it 's the most engaging app we 've ever seen exist on mobile so far			1
" it 's on a path to connecting a billion people			2
there are very few services in the world that can reach that level and they 're all incredibly valuable			0
" @entity5 said there were no plans to harvest data from @entity2 messages , in answer to a question from the audience			1
" that 's the service that people want , we would be silly to change it			0
" asked if he thought concerns over privacy could be a problem for @entity6 as it aims for greater global penetration , he said : " the @entity43 issue is a real issue , especially for @entity45 internet companies			2
" trust is just such an important thing when you 're thinking about using any service where you 're going to share important and personal information			0
" we continue to work to be sure we can share everything that the government is asking of us			0
" " the government kind of blew it on this			0
governments have a responsibility to protect folks and to also be transparent about what they 're doing and i think they 've just been way over the line in terms of sharing what they are doing			0
" but they are only now starting to get to the range of where they should have been			0
i think this whole thing could have been avoidable and it would have been a lot better for the internet			0
" asked if @entity6 would consider bidding again for @entity72 , @entity5 said : " after buying a company for $ 16 billion you 're probably done for a while			1
" @entity72 reportedly turned down a $ 3 billion offer from @entity6 last year			1
@entity5 's debut at the trade show , the biggest of its kind in the world , underlines the importance of mobile to the future of the social media giant			1
while audience interest was in @entity2 , @entity5 -- on stage with technology journalist and writer @entity88 --- was at the show to promote @entity6 's work with @entity91			1
@entity6 partnered with technology leaders , nonprofits , local communities and experts for the initiative			2
@entity5 said the goal of @entity91 is to ensure everyone in the world has access to the internet in some form , either for a small cost or for free			2
he said this could be achieved by improving mobile infrastructure and reducing the amount of data required to use services			0
" most people in the world do n't have access to the internet at all ... it 's about 2.7 billion people today			2
it 's growing way slower than you would imagine			0
our vision is to try to connect everyone			0
" earlier monday , @entity6 announced it would help roll out an online education program in @entity121			0
the deal , which will initially be offered to university students , has been done in partnership with telecommunications giant @entity125 , which is providing free educational data for a year to those who sign up and @entity128 , which is offering discounted smartphones to those participating			0
@entity132 , senior analyst at @entity133 , said @entity5 's appearance in @entity1 made sense given that mobile is key to @entity6 's strategy			1
" it gives him the opportunity to engage with key mobile operator partners , which will be important in the wake of @entity6 's acquisition of @entity2 , " she said			1
" mobile operators will be keen to discuss with and to learn from @entity5 his plans for developing @entity6 further as a service from which he can generate revenues from mobile			1
" @entity149 said the announcement in @entity1 by @entity2 ceo @entity151 that the messaging service will add voice calls to its product in the second quarter of 2014 will also be something that mobile operators will want to talk to @entity5 about .			1
