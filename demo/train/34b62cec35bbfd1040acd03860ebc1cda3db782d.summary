" @entity2 can not verify the authenticity of the statement , which also accused the @entity1 of " committing all of these grievances in a time when we see their women flooding our nations , filling our shores , poorly dressed and nude in a deliberate defiance to the feelings of @entity18 and in clear contempt to the teachings of the @entity14 faith , traditions and norms			1

" the problem of the burqa is not a religious problem			0
this is an issue of a woman 's freedom and dignity			0
