-- i do n't think anyone is ready for grief			2
but when it hits you , it knocks you out cold			2
i was told that tears and the sorrow would come in waves			1
for me , it 's been more like a riptide or a tornado , constantly circling around me , whipping me in the face			1
sometimes it stabs ; sometimes it punches ; sometimes it drowns me			2
my grieving process began in march , when i got a phone call from my mom while at work			1
she told me that my dad had suddenly stopped breathing and that i needed to get home to @entity23 as soon as possible			1
the seven - hour car ride felt like an eternity			1
as the optimist i am , i kept telling myself that my dad would pull out of it			2
but when i got to the hospital and saw the looks on my relatives ' faces , i knew the situation was much worse than i thought			2
my father had a major brain hemorrhage , the kind that you do n't recover from			1
i sat by his side for roughly 48 hours , with my siblings and my mom , holding his hand until he took his last breath			2
the loss did n't hit me until a few days after the funeral , when all the out - of - town relatives were gone and friends and neighbors made fewer " check - ins			1
" my parents ' home did n't feel like home anymore , just an empty space			2
friends were just people who did n't understand what i was going through			1
first person : my life as a little person i had always been an incredibly social person and loved being surrounded by people			1
i always found a reason to smile ; i always cracked jokes			2
but after my father 's death , the world became a dark and scary place			1
i wanted to crawl into a dark corner and avoid everyone			2
this grief felt insurmountable and incredibly alienating			2
i went from planning a family vacation to planning a eulogy in a matter of days			2
it 's the kind of whiplash that is emotionally and mentally paralyzing			1
i attempted to manage my own grief while trying to be strong for my mom and my family			2
and to top it all off , i had to deal with some of the more practical matters			0
my mother and i had to close down his real estate appraisal business , and i had to explain to client after client that my dad had passed away , previously healthy , at the age of 64			0
do you have a first - person essay ? share it with @entity85 the resounding response was always : " what ? but we just talked to him a few days ago , and he sounded fine ! " i would quickly hang up the phone before they could witness my imminent breakdown			1
then there was the task of planning his memorial service			0
my mom , my siblings and i were all in a daze as we ironed out the details			0
when i gave the tribute at his memorial service , i described him as the kind of guy who was " a mountain among pebbles			0
" i needed everyone to know just how amazing he was			0
it 's part of the reason why i am sharing this with you			1
my dad , @entity113 , was a real estate appraiser with a penchant for perfectionism			1
he was a senior @entity117 volleyball player , a former coach and an avid member of an @entity121 marching club in @entity122			0
friends would tell you he was the life of any party			1
his six siblings -- older and younger -- always called him for advice on everything from real estate to relationships			0
he and my mom were inseparable			0
for me , he embodied everything good in the world			1
i remember when my first love dumped me in high school , he spent hours sitting with me in the middle of the night as i cried , constantly reminding me of the amazing woman i was			0
he baked a cake for his grandson -- my nephew @entity141 -- every year for his birthday			0
he was n't even very good at baking , but he 'd spend hours meticulously frosting his creation			0
first person : a fat girl gets naked now , more than six months later , those fond memories come often			0
i remember sitting on the porch in the days after he died , steeped in sorrow and angry at the world			1
out of nowhere , i heard my neighbors play one of my dad 's favorite songs , " @entity156 " by the @entity157			1
i went from crying to laughing as i recalled a fond memory			0
one day , he and i were in the car and it came on the radio			0
we both belted the ballad out at the top of our lungs			0
moments like that serve as reminders for me to live my life fully and with joy			1
my father lived a life full of love			1
and the best thing i can do to honor him is to try to do the same			0
those little moments make me look at the world differently			1
life is suddenly more precious , more beautiful			1
so many things remind me of my dad			0
i see the love he had for me and my family in everything			0
every time i eat an apple , i 'm reminded of the time we went apple - picking in @entity189			1
it was late in the season , and he was the only one of us tall enough to actually grab the fruit			0
when the @entity195 play a game , i think about how he 'd yell at the tv , a trait he definitely passed down to me			0
i try to remind myself of how fortunate i am , to have had 27 years with this incredible man			0
i still have the support of my mom , and that 's what keeps me going most days			1
she lost her husband of more than 30 years , her best friend , and yet somehow she finds the strength to be there for me daily			1
she and my father taught me everything i know about love and family , and she and i often lean on each other for support			1
but i 'd be lying if i said it was n't a struggle every single day			0
the biggest relief from the pain has been surrounding myself with photos and mementos of joyful moments			0
i constantly try to remind myself of a phrase i uttered in the hospital as i saw our whole family surround him to say their last goodbyes : " so much love			0
" my father had so much love for others , and everyone i know loved him back			1
some days , i still feel the blow , fresh as new			0
i still have my riptide moments , and some days there are tornadoes			0
but mostly , there 's just love			2
and that has to be good enough for now .			0
