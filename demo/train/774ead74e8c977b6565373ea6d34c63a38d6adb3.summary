-- the remarkable display of civil disobedience by hundreds of thousands of @entity4 citizens reflects a profound sense of desperation that has grown as @entity7 has closed off all political options and made it increasingly clear that it intends to call the shots			1
in theory , the " @entity17 " spelling out the terms of the territory 's reversion to @entity7 rule was to allow a " high degree of autonomy , " leaving in place @entity4 's rule of law , civil service and free - wheeling capitalist system			1
this was based on then @entity7 president @entity24 's clever formulation of " @entity25 " and negotiated painstakingly during the 1990s with the @entity27 administration of the @entity28			1
since 1997 , when @entity4 reverted to @entity7 rule , many of @entity7 's efforts at exerting political influence have been subtle , and , with a few exceptions such as implicitly limiting the press , @entity4 has more or less been allowed to continue its open economy , legal system and freedom of assembly			1
but over time , it has appeared more one country and less two systems			0
the @entity17 envisioned gradual progression to universal suffrage by 2017			0
but as that date got closer , @entity42 sought to restrict that outcome			2
in june , @entity7 released its first - ever @entity45 on @entity4 , which stresses how @entity4 's autonomy has limits			1
the " power to run local affairs " remains -- but only " as authorized by the central leadership			0
" in other words , your liberty stops when we say so			0
the @entity45 offered other reinterpretations of the @entity56 , including the notion that the territory 's judicial decisions must " take into account the needs of @entity7 , " a vague requirement but crystal clear to @entity4			1
on the core issue of democracy , one that has repeatedly brought @entity66 from all walks of life into the streets , the @entity45 speaks of introducing universal suffrage as promised in the @entity17 by 2017 -- but the requirements to run in the elections are that a candidate must be " patriotic " and " love @entity7			2
" of course , it is @entity42 who determines which candidates meet that criteria			2
@entity42 defined what those requirements mean in a decision on september 4 , namely that all candidates must be chosen by a " nominating committee " comprised of @entity84 local elites			2
the disappointment in @entity4 was palpable , sparking the " @entity86 " that reached record numbers of tens of thousands in the streets on @entity7 's october 1 national day holiday			1
@entity42 has been largely silent , preventing the @entity7 media from even reporting the protests , with state - run media charging that the clearly homegrown protests are fueled by " foreign forces			1
" protestors are calling on chief executive @entity96 to resign			0
typically , @entity42 prefers local leaders to deal with such crises			2
the ruling @entity99 sees its legitimacy as fragile and president @entity101 can not afford to show any weakness			1
but @entity96 appears to have few options			0
there may be a potential middle ground of compromise , but many doubt that @entity96 has the flexibility to negotiate with @entity4 protestors			0
but @entity42 's @entity4 problem has implications well beyond the former @entity28 colony			1
as @entity7 's former paramount leader , @entity24 had introduced the " @entity25 , @entity116 " formula with @entity115 in mind			0
@entity7 's @entity99 - led state has always made the @entity115 uneasy			0
their skepticism has only deepened as they 've watched @entity42 's unelected rulers circumscribe @entity4 's freedoms			1
@entity7 's economic dynamism has also been a locomotive of growth for @entity4 , @entity115 and much of the region			1
@entity7 - @entity115 " cross-strait economic integration " has seen more than $ 100 billion in @entity115 investment in the mainland by some estimates , and @entity7 is now @entity115 's largest trade partner			0
but there is little support in @entity115 for political dialogue aimed at a @entity4 - like reunification scheme			0
@entity7 has appeared comfortable with ruling @entity139 president @entity138 , who has accelerated cross-strait interaction more than any of his predecessors			2
still , popular protests in @entity143 against new cross-straits trade accords , and more recently in sympathy with @entity4 , suggest that the next @entity115 presidential elections in 2016 could result in a @entity143 with which @entity42 is uncomfortable			1
in his first statement on @entity115 upon taking office , @entity101 said , " the issue of political disagreements that exist between the two sides must reach a final resolution , step by step			0
these issues can not be passed on from generation to generation			0
" beyond @entity115 , @entity7 's assertiveness toward territorial claims in the @entity159 and @entity160 has made its neighbors fearful of the implications of @entity7 's re-emergence			0
enlightened self - interest would suggest that @entity7 find an accommodation within the framework of the @entity17			0
but given the stakes perceived by @entity42 , @entity7 is less concerned about its global image and far more concerned with maintaining control			1
one way forward , without having @entity42 's fingerprints on it , could be to allow @entity96 to seek a middle ground and negotiate with key opposition figures to end the protests in exchange for broadening the committee that vets candidates and / or offering a means for candidates to run if they attain a petition with a substantive number of signatures			2
absent such creativity , it is difficult to see how @entity4 's political problem can be resolved in a way that would convince those in the streets to fold up their umbrellas			0
in the event of an outcome that leaves the status quo in place in @entity4 , the @entity194 administration needs to address its own @entity7 dilemma with a @entity7 policy that seems to be tilting less toward cooperation and more towards competition : how to impose costs on @entity42 for unacceptable behavior .			1

@entity4 protests sign of desperation , says *ex-* @entity194 *ambassador* to @entity7 @entity209
@entity7 president @entity101 can not afford to show any weakness , @entity209 says
@entity194 must work out how to impose costs on @entity42 for unacceptable behavior , he writes
