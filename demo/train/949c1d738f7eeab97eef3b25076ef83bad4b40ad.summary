-- the world 's chocolate makers may specialize in delivering a sweet taste but the government of the @entity5 is seeking to address what it sees as the bitter treatment of the farmers who grow the industry 's raw materials			1
the @entity12 nation was the world 's biggest cocoa producer -- which is the main ingredient in chocolate -- between 2009 and 2010 , rearing some 1.19 million tons of the crop according to the @entity18 ( @entity18 )			1
thanks to a mixture of price volatility , internal instability within the @entity5 and a lack of protection from speculators however , an ever smaller portion of the billions of dollars of annual revenue the industry creates finds its way back to the country 's farmers			1
while this set up may benefit cocoa buyers and chocolate companies , non profits such as the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) have claimed that it forces farmers to pay low wages and encourages exploitative practices such as child labor			2
bittersweet times for @entity5 's cocoa industry but according to @entity44 , the @entity5 's agriculture minister , central government efforts are now being made to make the cocoa production process fairer and more profitable for farmers			1
" the profits made from the sale of cocoa have unfortunately not been beneficial enough to the farmers because of poor governance , " he says			2
@entity44 highlights the fact that farmers receive around a 40 % share in the price of the cocoa they grow			2
this , he claims , is not commensurate with the costs the process incurs and in the coming years he hopes to see this figure rise to 60 %			0
he also blames the country 's former president , @entity60 -- who refused to concede defeat in elections in october 2010 , leading to a six month long standoff before he was finally forced from power by military force -- for slowing reforms that will benefit the country 's cocoa growers			1
now that the political infighting is over and a new government in place however , @entity44 says that changes will be made to ensure the long term viability of one of the country 's most integral industries			1
" things can only get better , " he says			0
" the political crisis is behind us -- the armed conflict is behind us			0
@entity5 has become a country that aspires to be stable , " he adds			2
with the @entity5 contributing to roughly 40 % of global cocoa produce alone , such clear intentions of creating a durable and equitable production process should be good news for the world 's chocolate companies , as well as the country 's cocoa farmers			1
but while @entity44 is adamant that the central government is genuine in its attempts to help farmers , his words are met with a wary skepticism by those at the sharp end of the debate			2
@entity99 is a farmer and owner of a cocoa co-op deep within the @entity5 's rural hinterland			1
he says that unless real changes are made to ensure farmers are paid a fair price for their produce they will be forced to employ children and pay low wages , which in turn will create a variety of long term social and humanitarian problems			0
the human cost of chocolate " it 's not our choice ; it 's imposed on us , " he says of the price he receives for his cocoa produce			0
" we ca n't transform it			0
we produce it and we sell			0
we get the price that is imposed on us			0
we ca n't do it any other way			0
" @entity99 says that promises of reform to make cocoa farming fairer and more profitable have been made many times before			1
he cites a pledge made by the world 's leading chocolate companies to help end child labor almost a decade ago			1
" [ but ] in ten years , nothing has been done at all " to address this issue he says , ensuring he remains suspicious about the new government 's proclamations no matter how good they sound			0
with previous broken promises in mind , @entity99 adds that he will reserve judgment about whether conditions will be any different or fairer for farmers until he sees the price he receives for his next harvest .			0
