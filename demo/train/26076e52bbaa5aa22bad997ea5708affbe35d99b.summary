president @entity1 's aggressive new proposal to dramatically limit carbon pollution is a policy priority that he hopes will help shape his legacy			1
but a policy step that @entity1 considers good for the country and his presidency may be bad for certain @entity8 in tight election battles this year			1
@entity8 ' flight some of the toughest fights this campaign season are taking place in red or purple states where jobs and the economy are in a constant tug of war against the environment			1
they are also the states where @entity1 's plan to limit carbon emission from power plants will have its greatest impact			1
@entity1 's big environmental move : demanding power plants cut carbon @entity1 's proposal aims to reduce carbon pollution by 30 % by 2030 , but the @entity29 put out a study last week saying it will cost $ 50 billion and eliminate nearly 225,000 jobs			1
@entity32 are framing it as a job killer and electricity bill hiker , putting some @entity8 in a tough position in an uneven economy			2
" as he seeks to secure his legacy , @entity1 is finally getting his ' war on coal , ' " the @entity38 wrote in a statement slamming the proposal			1
coal power plants , the greatest polluters , are expected to be the most impacted by the new rules , if they 're finalized			1
some democrats from conservative coal - producing states quickly and sharply broke from the president			1
@entity50 produces the third-most coal in the country but has seen a reduction in coal jobs and production			0
a high - profile @entity58 race there has come down to who loves coal more			0
democrat @entity61 , who is running to unseat senate republican leader @entity62 , put out a strong statement opposing @entity1 's move			1
" president @entity1 's new @entity67 rule is more proof that @entity69 is n't working for @entity50 , " @entity61 said in a statement			1
" when i 'm in the @entity58 , i will fiercely oppose the president 's attack on @entity50 's coal industry because protecting our jobs will be my number one priority			2
" she is also actively attacking the president , running ads worth " six figures " in @entity50 newspapers that say " president @entity1 and @entity69 do n't get it			1
" her opposition is aggressive but it did n't stop @entity81 for connecting @entity61 to the president and fellow @entity8			2
" @entity61 was recruited by president @entity1 , who said he would ' bankrupt ' the coal industry , and @entity84 , who said ' coal makes us sick			2
' and she is being funded by liberals nationwide who know that a vote for her is a vote to ensure further implementation of their anti-coal agenda in the @entity58 , " @entity81 's spokeswoman @entity87 said in a statement			2
in @entity94 , which produces the second most coal , @entity8 candidate for @entity58 @entity97 also opposes the new rules			0
" i will stand up to president @entity1 , ( @entity100 ) @entity99 , and anyone else who tries to undermine our coal jobs , " @entity97 said in a statement			2
@entity94 rep. @entity105 , who is in a tough race to retain his seat , put out a statement announcing that he is introducing legislation to block @entity1 's proposal			1
the new effort could also play out in @entity112 , where sen. @entity113 , chairman of the @entity114 , is in a tough reelection campaign			2
@entity113 has been a major defender of fossil fuel - based energy industries as oil , natural gas and some coal are integral to her state 's economy			2
she straddled the issue carefully on monday by saying that carbon emissions should be reduced but with the input of @entity125 and not through the @entity67			1
and giving an olive branch to the powerful energy industry , she also praised it for reducing carbon			2
she did not praise the president			0
" @entity125 should set the terms , goals and time frame			0
greater use of natural gas and stronger efficiency measures adopted by the industry have already helped us reduce carbon emissions to their lowest levels in 20 years , " @entity113 said			1
her @entity38 opponent , rep. @entity140 slammed @entity113			0
his spokesperson , @entity141 , said she has done little to stop regulations that " tie down @entity112 's energy economy in an effort to promote a radical climate change agenda			0
" in @entity148 , another red state , @entity32 @entity147 called his opponent , @entity8 incumbent sen. @entity149 , " a rubber - stamp for @entity1 's anti-energy policies			1
" @entity149 said in a statement that she would push for changes in the plan , which will be subject to public comment			0
" i 'm talking to business leaders and energy experts in @entity148 about what this proposed rule will mean for our state and our economy			0
i want to make sure that the proposal does enough to recognize the progress we 've made reducing carbon emissions and promoting renewable energy , " she said			1
in @entity170 , @entity8 sen. @entity169 's statement underscores the difficulty of this issue in conservative states			2
he issued no position , instead saying he " will be listening to @entity170 " to determine if the rule is one they can accept			0
@entity8 sen. @entity177 of @entity178 was also noncommittal			0
he said he had " concerns " but would wait to hear what the people of his state thought			0
the issue is likely to come up in races in @entity186 , @entity94 and @entity187 as well			0
all produce coal but also lean conservative and have constituencies that are turned off by greater government regulation			0
but @entity192 , a former @entity1 spokesman , said division among @entity8 is expected , especially in campaign season			2
" you 're going to have instances where @entity8 are going to not be perfectly aligned with the president 's message , but that does n't mean the president 's policy is not the right one , " he said			0
the @entity32 is taking advantage , launching robocalls connecting candidates to @entity1 's " radical energy plan " in @entity94 , @entity112 , @entity207 and @entity187			1
@entity1 's fight before his administration announced the planned change , @entity1 held a conference call with members of the @entity213 and @entity58 in an attempt to shore up support and enthusiasm , indicating that this would be a political landmine for some @entity8 in tough races			1
but addressing the issue of climate change has been at the forefront of his legislative wish list			0
up until now , he has n't done much , hitting a number of roadblocks along the way			0
since failing to pass cap and trade legislation to limit carbon emissions through the @entity8 - led @entity58 in 2010 , @entity1 has struggled with @entity125			1
he has been saddled with a struggling economy and several foreign policy crises , effectively putting climate change on the back burner			0
inaction of his own initiative has also limited @entity1 's influence on the issue			1
he has repeatedly put off a decision to kill or approve the @entity237 , which is still unresolved and has upset everyone with a stake or position on the issue			0
the appointment of @entity242 as the president 's counselor earlier this year to revive a struggling @entity213 was also a signal that @entity1 was going to try again to address environmental pollution			1
@entity242 , who was chief of staff for former president @entity247 , has focused on progressive energy and environmental issues , authoring a book in 2008 that is heavy on the issues			0
these proposed rules on power plants are being billed as the most aggressive effort to combat pollution and climate change in decades , and @entity192 says this is a legacy issue for @entity1			1
" nothing has been done on this scale as it relates to combating climate change and it will absolutely be an important part of the president 's legacy , " he said			1
( @entity192 also does work for the environmental group the @entity264 )			0
@entity8 ' plight democrats who support the proposal will be backed by billionaire @entity269 , who has pledged to financially assist nearly a dozen candidates who support climate change proposals			2
not among those candidates are @entity8 who are opposing @entity1 's new rule , including @entity61 , @entity113 and @entity177			1
@entity275 billionaire prepares to attack ' anti-science ' republicans @entity269 praised the president 's initiative and blamed @entity125 for not addressing the issue			0
" this @entity125 has failed in its most basic responsibility to protect the health and welfare of the @entity287 people from this grave threat , " he said , indicating his support for candidates who will do more to address the issue in the future			0
and @entity192 says @entity32 will be the ones to suffer politically for being " saddled by the notion that climate denial is salable in 2014			0
