-- a federal judge ruled tuesday that an @entity3 law limiting marriage to heterosexual couples violates the @entity6 , giving yet another victory to same - sex marriage supporters			1
@entity10 district court judge @entity9 said the court would not immediately enforce this ruling -- therefore not opening the doors right away to marriages of gay and lesbian couples in @entity3 -- pending appeals			1
still , he delivered a clear opinion on how the voter - approved @entity3 state constitutional amendment relates to the @entity10 @entity6			1
" the court holds that @entity3 's constitutional amendment limiting marriage to opposite - sex couples violates the @entity23 of the @entity6 , " the judge wrote , saying that protection " is at the very heart of our legal system			1
" his decision specifically deals with " @entity35 " of an @entity3 constitutional amendment that says , in part , " marriage in this state shall consist only of the union of one man and one woman			2
" @entity9 said that " the @entity11 's rationality review reveals @entity35 an arbitrary , irrational exclusion of just one class of @entity3 citizens from a government benefit			2
" proponents of the state constitutional measure , he points out , " purposefully ( drew a line ) between two groups of @entity3 citizens -- same - sex couples desiring an @entity3 marriage license and opposite - sex couples desiring ( a ) marriage license			1
" @entity0 -- which has a copy of the ruling -- first learned of the court 's decision via @entity55			0
this case was first brought by a pair of lesbian couples in 2004 , the same year that @entity3 citizens voted to put a ban on same - sex marriage in their state 's constitution			1
@entity63 , one of the four women involved , told @entity0 that she is " absolutely thrilled " with the decision , saying it was worth the long fight			0
she and her partner , @entity68 , have lived in @entity3 for more than 50 years			0
they have been together for the past three decades and got a civil union in @entity72 and have marriage licenses issued from @entity74 , @entity75 , and @entity76			0
" you ca n't stay in this for nine years and not have faith , " @entity77 said			0
" ... i feel like we are already married , ( but ) i want our state to recognize our marriage			0
" @entity0 received no immediate response from the @entity88 district attorney 's office , which was among those arguing for the state 's same - sex marriage ban			1
gov. @entity92 spoke out against the ruling , which she said defied the views of 75 % of those who voted in favor of limiting marriage to a man and woman			0
" i support the right of @entity3 's voters to govern themselves on this and other policy matters , " @entity92 said			1
" i am disappointed in the judge 's ruling and troubled that the will of the people has once again been ignored by the federal government			1
" learn more about same - sex marriage several courts ruled on it over what now has nearly been a decade , but the momentous decisions were indirectly related			1
those were made last summer by the @entity10 @entity11 , which stated that the @entity117 " violates basic due process and equal protection principles applicable to the @entity116			0
" that meant the @entity10 government would -- for tax and other legal purposes -- recognize same - sex marriages			2
however , the rulings did not directly address the many states , like @entity3 , which have prohibited such marriages within their borders			0
yet it has opened the door for lower federal courts weighing in on the matter , like @entity10 district judge @entity132 's december 20 decision striking down @entity134 's ban on same - sex marriage			1
he argued that state 's law conflicted with the equal protection and due process guarantees under the @entity10 @entity6			2
@entity141 , a constitutional law professor at the @entity142 , said that federal district judges striking at state bans " looks like a trend " that , ironically , is kicking into gear in the generally conservative states of @entity134 and @entity3			1
" it seems to be moving much more quickly than people thought , " said @entity141			0
in his ruling tuesday , @entity9 brought up both the high court 's decision ( @entity153 ) and @entity132 's ruling , which he noted was about a case " nearly identical " to the one in @entity3			2
at least 1,000 marriage licenses were issued for gay and lesbian couples in @entity134 between the time @entity132 made his ruling and the @entity10 @entity11 issued its stay monday , pending appeals			1
the federal government said it will recognize those marriages , while the state of @entity134 said it would not			2
@entity9 's decision -- citing what happened in @entity134 -- to issue an immediate stay of his own decision means no gay or lesbian couples in @entity3 will be in limbo as the case likely moves forward in the federal courts			1
his ruling tuesday is not a total victory for the @entity3 couples			2
the judge did n't rule in support of their argument challenging section 2 of the @entity117 asserting that states shall not " be required " to accept same - sex marriages performed in other states			2
nor does it provide any " other relief , " such as possible monetary damages , as they 'd sought			0
still , @entity9 does say , " the @entity77 couple and their counsel are commended for their foresight , courage , and perseverance			0
" and he is clear in delivering the plaintiffs their biggest victory , regarding their chief focus in the @entity3 state constitution			0
" @entity35 , " @entity9 writes , " intentionally discriminates against same - sex couples desiring an @entity3 marriage license without a legally sufficient justification			1
" so what happens next ? @entity141 noted that @entity134 and @entity3 appeals could be heard together , because they 're similar and both in the @entity204			2
unlike the solitary district judges , such appeals are done by a panel of three judges whose mission is to decide whether or not the lower court erred in its decision			0
eventually , the @entity11 -- even though it has notably steered clear of ruling on state - by - state variations -- could weigh in , settling the matter of whether states can ban same - sex marriage once and for all			1
that is a prospect few might have anticipated prior to last summer 's @entity153 ruling , though there 's no telling how the divided court might come down			0
in the @entity153 case , the @entity11 struck down a key part of the @entity117 , which denied legally married same - sex couples the same federal benefits provided to heterosexual spouses			1
" @entity153 really might have been the tipping point , " @entity141 said			0
" but we 'll see			0
" @entity0 's @entity230 and @entity231 contributed to this report .			0
