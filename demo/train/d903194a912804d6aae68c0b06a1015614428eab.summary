-- users of social - networking sites such as @entity4 risk losing control of their personal information because they are not fully aware of the implications for their privacy , a freedom of information expert warned wednesday			1
@entity4 was forced to revert to its old user - ownership policy following a backlash from users			1
data - protection specialist @entity12 told @entity0 that social networking users should be very careful about what information they post on the @entity17			1
he said users should make sure they understand who could access their profiles , and how that information could be used			0
they also should familiarize themselves with sites ' privacy options , he said			0
" it is very important to take steps yourself to understand what is going on with your personal information , " @entity12 said			2
" once it 's out there it 's very difficult to get it back			0
you can lose control over it			0
" @entity4 , currently the world 's most popular social - networking site , was forced to back down wednesday after many members revolted against a change to its user information policy , which would have granted the site permanent rights to all photos and postings even after a user had closed down an account			1
but @entity12 , of @entity47 law firm @entity46 , said the case raises other issues of privacy concerning social networking , such as the security of personal data and whether information could end up in the hands of marketing companies			1
he also said that employers have been known to visit such sites to check personal details about prospective workers			0
young people , for whom communicating with friends via social - networking sites is often second nature , should be particularly careful about what they post online , @entity12 said			1
" they do n't have the level of suspicion that other people have about the internet because they just see it as a way to communicate and understanding the implications wo n't be in the forefront of their minds , " he said			0
@entity12 said the @entity4 backlash may have blown up out of a misunderstanding over the site 's attempt to clarify content ownership			1
but he said the way the company went about the change provoked alarm among some users of the site			0
" it comes down to how you deliver the message , " @entity12 said			0
" if you change your terms and conditions and remove a section and leave it at that without bringing it properly to people 's attention you 're going to get suspicion			0
" ireport.com : your thoughts on @entity4 's about - face data - protection laws differ from country to country			2
but @entity12 said web sites generally face a balancing act between meeting their legal requirements to explain their policy towards personal information -- often in the form of dense terms and conditions pages written in " legalese " -- and providing the same information in a way accessible to users			1
" one of the requirements of data protection is that personal information is processed fairly and lawfully			1
fairness is all about telling people what you are going to do with their information and being clear and transparent , " @entity12 said			2
" the difficulty is that in many cases you 've got a tension between insuring that you tell people what you need legally to tell them against making that clear and understandable			0
" ireport.com : too much information posted online ? but @entity12 said it was in sites ' interests to treat their users fairly			2
he said the @entity4 case demonstrates that social - networking services need to keep their users on their side -- or risk losing them to rivals			1
" it 's always in the interests of reputable sites to treat information fairly and treat their users fairly because the last thing you want to be seen to do is alienate people , " he said			2
" when people feel that they ca n't trust a site then they will go elsewhere			0

expert : social - networking site users risk losing control of personal information
