-- on wednesday , the @entity2 @entity1 will review the @entity3 , a landmark legislation that cleared barriers to the ballot box for all @entity2 citizens			1
in @entity8 , the @entity1 will hear arguments on @entity10 -- the heart of the @entity3 -- that allows the federal government to block state election practices that are discriminatory			1
a predominantly white county in @entity15 , @entity8 , charges that the decision of @entity17 in 2006 to reauthorize @entity10 is unconstitutional			0
the case comes on the heels of a federal election last fall in which our nation witnessed the greatest assault on voting rights in more than a half century			2
drastic cuts to early voting hours , restrictive photo id laws , tens of thousands of registered voters being dropped from poll books due to illegitimate purges were only a few of the tactics used to keep people from voting			1
@entity36 , a 102 - year - old @entity37 resident who was invited to join first lady @entity38 at the recent @entity40 address , stood in line for more than three hours to cast a ballot			0
sadly , thousands of voters had to endure waiting times up to eight hours , prompting president @entity45 to call for the nation to " fix it			0
" new laws and policies are being considered on the state and federal level now that will make it harder to vote -- particularly for the elderly , the young and people of color			1
without the protections afforded by @entity10 of the @entity3 , many @entity2 would find voting even more difficult			1
@entity58 is the one day where we are all equal			0
@entity61 , brown or white , rich or poor , we all have an equal say in the ballot box			0
voting is the most fundamental pillar of a democracy and it is imperative that we keep elections free , fair and accessible to all			1
opinion : @entity3 and the @entity71 on trial as this important debate begins anew , here are five key misconceptions you need to know about the @entity3 and why it remains as relevant today as the day it was originally signed			1
section 5 unfairly punishes the @entity71 for its past this provision of the @entity3 requires jurisdictions with a history of discriminatory voting practices to get federal " pre-clearance " ( essentially , permission from the @entity85 ) before changing any voting procedure			1
this applies to not just @entity71 , but also to other states such as @entity89 , @entity90 , along with certain counties in @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96			0
once a state has demonstrated that it can fairly run elections for a period of 10 years , it can be exempted from @entity10			2
in fact , every jurisdiction that has sought this " bailout " since 1982 has been approved			0
the jurisdictions that remain covered by @entity10 have not applied for bailouts			0
they are not being punished for their past , but held accountable for their present practices			0
the formula is outdated section 5 is not static , and dozens of jurisdictions have been added under the provision since it was first passed			0
in fact , section 5 was reconsidered and reauthorized by @entity17 in 1970 , 1975 , 1982 and 2006 based on extensive evidence of continuing discrimination			0
the @entity119 , @entity120 and other civil rights advocates have long pushed for expanding @entity10 's " pre-clearance " to include more states with voting problems , such as @entity124 and @entity125 , and more counties with records of egregious discrimination in voting			2
doing so , however , takes @entity17 action			0
so far , @entity133 's lawmakers have not demonstrated the political will			0
we should not revoke critical protections for fair voting simply because @entity17 has failed to act on expanding them			2
section 5 is no longer applicable the @entity3 was passed not only for the most extreme acts of intimidation , but also for the small changes , such as literacy tests and poll taxes , that made voting harder for people of color and poor whites			1
the last few years leading up to the 2012 elections saw the greatest efforts to pass restrictive voting laws since the @entity154 era , including limiting the type of @entity156 that people can use , and requiring additional proof of citizenship to register and vote , all of which disproportionately impact people of color and the working poor			1
these adjustments unfairly shift the goal line and demonstrate why @entity10 is still needed			0
section 2 is sufficient to ensuring fair voting procedures while section 2 of the law bans voting practices that discriminate on the basis of race or ethnicity , it is enforced only through lawsuits			2
when lawsuits are filed , the burden of proof rests with the challenger ( not the local or state government that has changed voting rules )			2
in contrast , @entity10 ensures that discrimination ca n't take hold by blocking problematic policies from going into effect in the first place			0
without these precautions , unfair voting policies would go unchecked , leaving disenfranchised voters to face harm later			1
the country reelected an @entity61 - @entity2 president , with a large share of support from black and @entity195 voters , so we no longer need their votes to be protected by @entity10 section 5 made a difference in the 2012 elections			1
it blocked restrictive photo id laws in @entity204 and @entity205 , and was used to reject a @entity204 redistricting plan that would undercut @entity195 voting power			1
and as the @entity2 @entity85 reviews @entity210 's photo id law , that measure is on hold			0
it is against this backdrop that the @entity1 will hear the challenge to @entity10 of the @entity3			1
losing this provision would signal a green light for even more partisan legislatures to manipulate election laws for political gains			2
at a time when voting rights are increasingly under attack , we should be expanding federal oversight of voting laws -- not scrapping the most effective civil rights legislation ever enacted			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity229 and @entity230 .			2

on wednesday , the @entity1 will review the @entity3
@entity233 , @entity230 : losing @entity234 would harm our democracy
leading up to the 2012 elections , we saw great efforts to pass restrictive voting laws , they say
hair , @entity230 : without @entity234 , unfair voting policies would go unchecked
