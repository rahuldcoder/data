-- as president @entity2 made his impassioned speech at @entity5 's funeral at a soccer stadium in @entity7 , the poverty - stricken @entity8 township that was a stronghold of support for the anti-apartheid struggle , he was standing at the procession of one of the people who had the greatest impact on his life			1
" over 30 years ago , while still a student , " the president said , " i learned of @entity5 and the struggles in this beautiful land			0
it stirred something in me			0
and while i will always fall short of @entity5 's example , he makes me want to be a better man			1
" @entity2 praised what this leader had accomplished for racial equality and in bringing down the apartheid regime			0
the speech , the first @entity33 - @entity33 president in the @entity34 speaking at the funeral of the first black president of @entity37 , is important in that it brings us back to the transformational nature of @entity2 , a basic fact that has been lost in all the partisan tumult and vitriol of the last few years			1
since he entered office , the very moment that brought so many @entity34 to tears , everything quickly returned to politics as usual			0
heated debates unfolded about his legislative agenda , and the underlying significance of his election in terms of the nation 's racial history faded for too many @entity34			2
while observers will be interpreting the meaning of each word in @entity2 's speech through the prism of domestic politics , examining each handshake with foreign leaders to glean the implications for international policy , the speech itself and @entity2 standing in @entity5 's shadow should be powerful reminders of the progress that we have made in race relations			1
@entity5 and the rev. @entity74 were part of a global struggle for equality in the 1950s and 1960s that rocked societies that were built on the foundation of racial inequality			0
while civil rights leaders in the @entity34 and freedom fighters in @entity37 took different paths and faced different challenges , their goals were similar			1
in @entity37 , @entity5 would eventually help to bring down the apartheid regime and dismantle a brutal system of white rule			2
within the @entity34 , the civil rights movement ended legalized racial segregation and strengthened the ability of the federal government -- until this year -- to protect @entity33 voting rights			1
the election of an @entity33 - @entity33 president was also part of these long - term accomplishments , bringing down another barrier in political leadership that once seemed unmovable			0
the civil rights accomplishments were incomplete			2
many problems facing african - americans still persist and have sometimes been ignored by policymakers			0
the disproportionate number of african - americans in @entity34 prisons remains a blight on the nation 's record			2
the devastating conditions facing certain african - americans living in the inner city are part of another massive problem that needs to be repaired			0
racism , moreover , has reared its head in recent years among some of @entity2 's detractors			1
but @entity2 's speech is a healthy and much needed reminder about what took place in 2008 and what he will mean in the @entity33 history textbook for decades to come			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity130 .			0

@entity130 : @entity2 and @entity5 : the two first black presidents of their nations
