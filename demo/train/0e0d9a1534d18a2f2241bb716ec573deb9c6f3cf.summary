in a perfect world of course , there would be no serious predatory crime , and thus no need nor call to respond to it			2
we would n't have murder , attempted mass murder , or the sexual abuse of children			2
but alas , that world seems all too remote today			2
assuming we continue to have murder and other serious crime which kills or maims innocents , what should we do about it ? most of us believe that rarely , but sometimes , callous , depraved , vicious predators do deserve to die			0
opinion : death penalty is unchristian and we feel certain that justice requires they get what they deserve			1
related : @entity25 joins @entity27 's @entity26 to answer your death penalty questions but not all convicted murderers deserve to die			1
we must fundamentally commit ourselves to ensure that those who do n't deserve to die -- either because they did not really commit murder , or because they are not the worst of the worst of the worst -- will not be executed			1
we should construct our punishments more nearly to fit their crimes -- neither much more nor much less than what they deserve			0
let 's have better definitions for who should die			1
i 've spent decades visiting prisons and interviewing convicted killers and corrections officers			2
i 'm convinced that states with the death penalty can and should morally refine their statutes			1
my crime and punishment memoir , " the death of @entity57 , " details many changes and suggests a model death penalty statute , reserved for especially heinous , atrocious and cruel killers			1
this includes not only sadistic serial murderers -- those who relish torturing their vulnerable victims , especially condemned for their cowardice -- but also cold , cruel , callous killers who may not intend to kill , but simply do n't give a damn			1
in short , mass murderers , terrorists , sadistic serial killers , contract killers or other paid assassins deserve to die			2
once we more consistently condemn the attitude of those who act with a depraved indifference , we will also punish more severely " red collar killers " -- callous corporate executives who calculatedly cause the deaths of unsuspecting employees or consumers -- for the serious crimes they commit , albeit from the best of motives : the profit motive			2
in a more perfect world , we 'd shed double standards and embrace more nearly a uniform metric of justice			0
at the same time that we punish more , we should punish less			0
remove many other standard -- aggravating circumstances which make a person eligible for execution in states that allow the death penalty			1
robbery , burglary other than home invasion and drugs should not elevate murder into capital felony murder			0
if we drop economic crimes such as robbery and drugs as aggravating circumstances , racial disparity will drop significantly			0
rape still qualifies as torture , however , and all other things equal , rapist murderers do deserve to die			0
in short , we can -- and should -- define the worst of our worst more clearly and punish them more nearly as they deserve			0
let 's be more certain that they are guilty			2
western culture has essentially committed us to a presumption of life , of innocence and we have long required special proof of guilt before we punish with death			2
" super due process " requires vigorous defense counsel challenging the prosecution to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt to a unanimous jury			0
death ( or life without parole ) as society 's ultimate punishment demands even more , however			1
a jury should not only be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the condemned did it , but also that they deserve their punishment			0
in the separate penalty phase of a trial , where the question is not guilt or innocence , but life or death as punishment , a jury should be left with no lingering doubt -- no real doubt , however irrational -- about the convicted killer 's guilt			1
even this should not be enough to condemn a vicious predator to die			0
a nearly unanimous jury should be convinced with no " lingering or residual doubt " that the convicted murderer did it , and to " a moral certainty " that he or she deserves to die for it			0
no state has adopted this higher , special burden of persuasion , but they should			0
let 's choose a better execution method			1
lethal injection -- which grabs headlines these days -- never was and never will be a good execution method			2
the execution scene i witnessed resembled final goodbyes at a hospital or hospice for the terminally ill. the dying person lies on a gurney , wrapped in white sheets , an iv attached , surrounded by medical technicians with loved ones in attendance			0
we should oppose lethal injection , not because it might cause pain , but because it certainly causes confusion , wantonly merging punishment and treatment			2
the firing squad seems to me the best of traditional methods , but a state might give a member of the victim 's family a choice among available constitutional options			1
in any case , when we do punish we should be clear and make it clear that we are punishing			0
we should reconnect the punishment to the crime			0
before ( or after ) the condemned makes a final statement , the victim 's family or friends may display a brief audiovisual memorial of the victim 's life			1
we should make punishment honest and overt			0
let 's take a hard look at inmates ' prison lifestyle			1
most vicious killers a jury condemns to die will never be executed			1
and even those we do kill , will live out much of their lives on death row			1
for the worst of the worst whom we have condemned , daily life on death row should be their punishment			1
their conditions should be no better than what corrections reserve for lesser criminals who commit additional offenses inside prison and are additionally punished with punitive or administrative segregation			2
it 's obscene today that sometimes our condemned killers inside prison live better than our working innocent poor in society			1
specifically , within constitutional bounds , those we condemned to die or live a life in prison with no chance of parole -- the worst of the worst -- should be allowed only the minimum constitutionally mandated exercise , phone calls , or physical contact			1
they should not be permitted any communal form of recreation or play			0
for the rest of their lives , their food should be nutraloaf , nutritionally complete and tasteless			0
photographs of their victims should be posted in their cells , out of reach , in visibly conspicuous places			0
prison administration should make every effort to connect punishment to crime			0
departments of corrections should administer prisons to protect the public , protect staff , and provide humane supervision of prisoners with opportunities and programs that meaningfully support successful community reintegration for the vast majority of offenders sentenced to a term of years or life with a possibility of parole			0
we must recognize that economic circumstances drive people to commit crimes			0
in a more perfect world we would stop punishing drug dealers as if they were murderers			0
we should allow and encourage lesser criminals to pay for the crimes and give them real opportunities to start fresh			0
but for those prisoners sentenced to death or life without parole , corrections should administer punishment : an unpleasant , restrictive daily regimen designed to continually convey society 's intense disapproval of the crime and the criminal			1
and when mistakes are made ? during the penalty phase of a capital trial , skilled defense attorneys should attempt effectively to humanize even guilty defendants			1
anyone , including friends or family , may recount the convicted murderer 's good deeds or emphasize the killer 's own traumatic suffering or abuse as a child			1
but recognizing that even murderers remain human beings , defense attorneys should not discourage their clients from taking responsibility , nor use the defendants to promote their own abolitionist agenda			2
prosecuting attorneys , in their turn , may call surviving friends or family to humanize the victim and testify to their own sense of loss			1
the @entity316 @entity315 has ruled that survivors must express no opinion on the killer 's proper sentence			2
regardless of how survivors feel , however , the victim 's opinion of the killer 's fate should count			1
thus , a reliable living will or declaration of life should be admissible in the penalty phase			2
as long as evidence clearly supports it as authentic , the jury should hear that the victim would have opposed -- or supported -- the death penalty ( or life without parole ) for the killer and give that fact such weight as they think it deserves			1
in the unusual but real case where we later discover an innocent person has been condemned to die or imprisoned for life without parole , the state shall not only release that victim , but also pay substantial reparations to the wrongly condemned or surviving family , regardless of whether any public official intentionally or recklessly miscarried justice			1
and should an investigation clearly establish that prosecutors or police ever intentionally and unlawfully suppressed evidence of innocence while capitally prosecuting , they should themselves be prosecuted for attempted murder			0
if they recklessly caused the death or loss of liberty of the innocent , they should be prosecuted and punished for depraved indifference reckless endangerment			1
again , there would be no vicious predators in a more perfect world , nor would innocents ever be convicted			0
however , in this world , we can -- and must -- do more to ensure that the punishments more nearly and reliably fit the crimes .			0

death penalty advocate : reserve executions for especially heinous , atrocious and cruel killers
*replace* injection with firing squad or let victim 's family choose , @entity25 says
restrict death row inmates to minimal exercise , phone calls , or physical contact
@entity25 : if innocent defendants are wrongly executed , families should be compensated
