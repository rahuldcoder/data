-- pope @entity1 delivered his final angelus prayer to a crowd of thousands gathered at @entity5 in @entity6 on sunday , as he prepares to retire			1
here is the full text of his sermon : dear brothers and sisters			0
during the service on the second @entity14 , the @entity12 is always presented			0
@entity15 , the evangelist , has highlighted the fact that @entity17 transfigured while he prayed			0
his is a deep , profound experience of relationship with the @entity20 during a sort of spiritual retreat that @entity17 lives on a high mount accompanied by @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 , the three disciples who were always present during the moments of the divine manifestation of the master			0
the lord , who not long ago had proclaimed his death and resurrection , offers the disciples an anticipation of his glory			0

" the presence of @entity44 and @entity45 later on , representing the laws and the prophets of the ancient covenant , is far more important : all the story of the covenant is oriented towards @entity50 , the @entity51 , who fulfills a new exodus not towards the promised land as during the times of @entity44 but towards @entity55			1
@entity23 's intervention : " master , it is beautiful for us to be here " represents the impossible attempt to stop such mystical experience			0
@entity63 has commented : " @entity23 ... on the @entity64 ... @entity51 's only food was the soul			0
because he must have descended to return to exhaustion and pain , while above , he was filled with feelings of sacred love towards @entity71 , which thus inspired him to a sacred path			0
" pondering over this fragment of the @entity77 , we can draw a very important lesson : first of all , the supremacy of prayer , without which all the apostolate endeavors , and that of charity , will be reduced to activism			1
during @entity14 , let us learn to give the right time to prayer , both personal and community prayer , which breathes air into our spiritual life			1

@entity101 existence -- i have written in the message for this @entity14 -- means to continuously climb up the mount for our encounter with @entity71 , so that afterward we can descend again filled with his love and strength to serve our brothers and sisters with the very love of @entity71			1
@entity113 , this @entity114 i feel in a particular way towards me , at this moment in my life			2
the @entity118 is calling me to " climb the mount , " and to devote myself to meditation , reflection and prayer			1
however , this does not mean abandoning the @entity125 , but rather , if @entity71 has requested this of me , it is so that i can continue to serve the @entity125 with the same dedication and the same love with which i have done up until now , but in a way adapted to my age and my strength			1
let us invoke @entity134 's intercession : let her guide all of you to follow the lord @entity17 always , in prayer as well as in laborious charity .			2
