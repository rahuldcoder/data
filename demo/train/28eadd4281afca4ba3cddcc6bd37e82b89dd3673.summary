@entity0 -- it 's a scenario we 've seen before : a gridlocked @entity4 pushes off legislative action until the last minute			0
but this time , leaders could n't reach a deal before they were scheduled to break for a five - week recess			0
house speaker @entity9 and his new leadership team were prepared to pass a bill to fund a response to the crisis at the southern border			1
but then , sen. @entity15 of @entity16 called a pizza party , and all bets were off			1
the bill that @entity9 was pushing was n't even expected to be taken up by the @entity20 because @entity21 oppose a proposed fix to a 2008 law that makes it more difficult to deport children from @entity25			1
coming in at $ 659 million -- after @entity27 leaders twice scaled down their proposal from an initial $ 1.5 billion -- the bill was a sliver of president @entity32 's $ 3.7 billion request			0
certainly no one could suggest @entity34 were caving in to the @entity35			2
but @entity15 and his tea party allies in the @entity35 were determined to oppose the bill unless @entity34 leaders tacked on a provision that would reverse an @entity32 administration policy shielding young migrants and toughen the @entity43 ' deportation policy			1
less than 24 hours after @entity15 pow - wowed with @entity45 over pizza pies , @entity9 canceled the vote when he realized he did n't have enough support to pass what was already considered no more than a show vote			1
@entity15 denied playing a lead role in killing the bill , but insiders were quick to give the senator a new title : speaker @entity15			1
oh , and of course , @entity57 's @entity0 bureau chief piped in			0
then there 's this zinger from a @entity27 strategist and @entity1 political commentator : meanwhile , @entity15 gave an exclusive interview to the @entity65 's @entity64 , whose reporting has led the narrative on @entity15 's role			2
that denial has n't kept @entity35 @entity34 leadership aides and rank - and - file republicans from pinning the bill 's failure on @entity15 getting involved in the wrong chamber			1
it would n't be the first time that 's happened			0
but maybe @entity0 is just delusional , as @entity15 suggested thursday on @entity77			2
it certainly did n't stop democrats from seizing on the idea of @entity15 , a tea party favorite who has rubbed establishment @entity45 the wrong way more than once , leading the @entity27 caucus			1
@entity21 also criticized @entity9 for acting to sue @entity32 for abusing his executive authority , and then calling on him to act unilaterally to address the border crisis			2
the @entity21 's national press secretary jumped at the chance to slam @entity9 's leadership failure : @entity93 backers did n't hesitate either , like @entity94 , the influential conservative radio host			2
conservative pundit @entity95 , who said @entity35 @entity34 should tack the @entity15 - backed provision to a border bill , also weighed in			1
right or wrong , these new optics are not threading a positive storyline for congressional @entity34 , especially ahead of the 2014 midterms			0
these questions about the influence of the @entity35 @entity34 leaders could n't come at a worse time as @entity45 transitioned leadership into new hands			2
@entity108 and @entity109 just took over as @entity35 majority leader and majority whip , respectively , after rep. @entity112 officially stepped down as the no. 2 @entity27 on thursday			0
despite the official change in leadership			0
observers floated questions about who actually retained control of the house after the @entity112 passed the baton to @entity108 and @entity109 , suggesting that a de facto leader was really calling the shots			0
@entity112 's primary loss to an underfunded insurgent challenger stunned the @entity27 establishment in june			0
and it appears the tea party -- this time embodied by @entity15 and his allies in the @entity35 -- is continuing to give @entity34 leaders a headache			1
which makes the timing of @entity112 's exit a genius move			0

@entity15 is being *branded* by *man*y as the *man* who killed the @entity35 border bill
allies *gathered* over pizza and the next day @entity9 realized he did n't have enough votes
@entity15 and his allies denied that he *twisted* arms to get his way
@entity16 has a new *moniker* : " @entity150 "
