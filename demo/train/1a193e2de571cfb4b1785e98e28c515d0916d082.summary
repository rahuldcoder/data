-- my kids -- 4 , 6 and 8 -- love the movie " @entity4			0
" it 's about a video game character that desperately wants to win a medal			1
meanwhile , at the @entity10 , defense secretary @entity9 is reviewing a new policy that awards medals to drone operators who might think they 're in a video game			1
predatory drones have changed the art of war			1
as to the question of whether it 's been a change for the good or the bad , that coin is still in the air			1
this much we know : this is not your father 's brand of warfare			1
that was more up - close and personal			0
when your dad served in @entity32 -- let alone , when your grandfather fought in @entity34 -- they took the fight to the enemy , and they had to step into the theater of war to do it			1
sometimes , they even engaged in hand - to - hand combat			0
fighter pilots were shot down			0
those captured by the enemy became prisoners of war			2
and in recognition of such acts of valor , the military gives out medals -- the @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			2
that 's how it has always worked			2
in defense of your country , you put yourself at risk of death or at least great personal harm			2
and your country shows its gratitude by giving you a medal			2
when you receive this kind of commendation , you are assured that your service has been exemplary and your sacrifice significant			0
oh , the military still awards plenty of the traditional medals -- the old school way			2
yet under a policy approved by @entity80 's predecessor , @entity79 , on his way out the door , military officials are also preparing to offer something called " the @entity84			1
" it recognizes " extraordinary direct impacts on combat operations			0
" but -- and here 's the important part -- it has no " geographic limitation			2
" so if you kill an insurgent in @entity94 , you do n't really have to be physically present in @entity94			0
you do n't even have to be in that part of the world			0
you can be sipping coffee and checking your e-mail thousands of miles away in a control room in @entity101			0
you press a few buttons and eliminate a few people			0
then , at the end of your shift , you wrap up and drive to your kid 's soccer game			1
it 's all in a day 's work			2
when it was announced that drone operators would now be eligible for medals , lawmakers and veterans groups raised concerns that the medal would eclipse those typically given for bravery in battle			1
they do n't want the medal scrapped			2
they just want it downgraded and put in its proper place in the pecking order			0
but concerns like that are not likely to resonate with most @entity129 who -- let 's face it -- ca n't tell one medal from another			1
critics are right to be angry			0
but they 're upset about the wrong thing			0
these special medals are really a bad idea , and the reasons for that have less to do with the pecking order among medals and more to do with the detached way that drone operators carry out their remote - control missions			1
first , these high - tech cowboys are never in harm 's way			1
you simply ca n't compare what they do from behind a desk with what others do on the battlefield			0
second , the whole concept is morbid			0
we know that innocent civilians have died in drone strikes in @entity160			1
sooner or later , the criteria for this medal may become : " how many kills do you have ? " the more kills , the more likely you are to get a medal			2
lastly , handing out rewards and incentives for drone strikes only reinforces the fantasy of war as a video game , where you do well when you advance			1
we have enough of that already among a young generation of soldiers that grew up playing video games			0
we should n't encourage more of it			0
@entity10 officials are expected , in the next month , to decide the fate of the medal for drone operators			1
heading up the review will be @entity184 chairman gen. @entity183			0
he could make the award less prestigious , raise the qualifications , do away with it or just leave things the way they are			1
here 's the way forward			0
@entity183 should n't bother downgrading the medal , so the other medals do n't get jealous			1
he should just recommend that it be scrapped altogether			0
while there are those who want to turn war into a video game , someone needs to have the decency to pull the plug			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			1

a policy is under review that would make it *feasible* to award medals to drone operators
@entity203 : @entity10 officials should scrap this medal altogether
he says unlike other medals , drone operators are never in harm 's way
@entity203 : handing out award for drone strikes reinforces fantasy of war as a video game
