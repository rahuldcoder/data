@entity0 -- in many ways , the debate over taming the nation 's spending and deficit beasts can be compared to a family 's hand - wringing over what to cut , and what to keep , in tough times			1
it may be easy to nix " luxuries " like vacations and eating out			2
but should " essentials " like a car or a home be downsized or gotten rid of to save money ? tough choices about what to keep , kill or cut back on are the kinds of things the nation 's lawmakers are considering as they try to trim a $ 14 trillion debt			1
should familiar yet costly " essentials " -- entitlements like @entity27 , the nation 's health insurance program for seniors , and @entity31 , which provides health insurance for the nation 's poor -- be phased out or dramatically overhauled ? @entity35 chairman @entity34 laid out the @entity37 plan last week			1
it would radically overhaul @entity27 and @entity31 while lowering top tax rates			1
president @entity40 on wednesday laid out his plan for long - term deficit reduction , renewing his call for ending the @entity45 - era tax cuts for families making more than $ 250,000 while strengthening @entity27 and @entity31			1
the @entity48 's mantra to " stop the spending " largely refocused the national conversation on spending			2
is it willing to see entitlement programs fundamentally changed ? @entity54 , a spokesman for the @entity55 , says one way to reduce spending is to cut waste , overlap and excess in government programs			1
and yet @entity54 also partially endorsed @entity34 's plan , which would dismantle the current @entity27 program starting in 2022 in favor or a voucher program , though it would not affect anyone who 's 55 or older now			1
" [ the @entity34 plan ] addresses the fact that people who have paid their whole lives , that you do n't want to put them into a hardship , through no fault of their own , " @entity54 said			1
" at the same time , we need to make changes to the plan , for people who are younger			2
" " @entity31 is something we talk about like it 's a @entity78 - given right , when it 's only been around since the 1960s			1
it 's a program that we phased in			2
we can easily start to phase it out , " he said			0
@entity82 , another prominent @entity48 group , echoed similar sentiments			0
@entity84 , a spokesman , told @entity1 , " the first thing you have to do is roll back entitlements you ca n't afford			1
@entity88 is moving them towards solvency			0
one of the best ways to do that -- especially for younger workers -- is through some kind of voluntary personal accounts			0
" and yet , @entity84 acknowledged that his and other @entity48 support organizations would have a tough time selling such ideas to everyday @entity99			0
" it 's part of our job to get out there and to educate and make sure that voters have a choice and understand what we 're talking about , " @entity84 said			0
" we 're not talking about throwing @entity108 out on the street			0
what we are talking about doing is making hard , difficult decisions that are going to get the country , the fiscal house in order			0
" a fresh @entity116 poll , released wednesday , shows how steep the hill may be			0
the poll finds that while @entity99 are nearly evenly split on whether @entity37 proposals to cut spending go too far , only three in 10 think the @entity37 budget treats all groups in society fairly , while seven in 10 believe that @entity37 proposals favor some groups over others			1
meanwhile , @entity82 advocates going beyond radically reforming familiar entitlement programs and calls for the elimination of some very familiar government functions			1
specifically naming the departments of @entity132 , @entity84 said , " i think you could pretty much do away with the entire departments ... just eliminate them			0
" @entity136 , a resident scholar at the @entity137 , does n't think that will happen			0
" i do n't think you 're going to find much appetite for that , " he said			0
@entity136 also criticized calls for dramatic overhauls of @entity31 and @entity27 , especially as seen in the @entity34 plan			1
" you 're really talking about ... shifting the cost of health care from where seniors pay about 30 % to where they pay closer to 70 % , " he said			0
" my guess is , at best , you 're going to get a mixed reaction from that group to this set of proposals			0
" though @entity136 feels that now is a good time to discuss the nation 's debt problem , he equated lawmaker support for @entity34 's plan to " falling on a grenade			1
" it " does n't take a dime from @entity162 , or takes very little from @entity162			0
and cuts taxes for the wealthy and for companies , even as it takes a lot out of @entity27 and @entity31			1
so it becomes a question of whether this is seen as fair , " @entity136 said			0
as many lawmakers frame the debate around protecting future generations , one noted historian says it 's worthwhile to look at the past			2
" cutting and balancing budgets is never really , in the end , that big of history stuff , " @entity178 professor of history @entity179 told @entity1			2
" if i asked you , ' what did [ president ] @entity186 do with his budget ? what did [ president ] @entity189 do with his budget ? what was [ president ] @entity193 's budget ? ' -- you would n't know			2
because 100 years from now , people wo n't think about budget fights so much			0
but they 're going to know , 100 years from now , that @entity99 pushed through civil rights acts in ' 64 and ' 65 , @entity99 created @entity31 and @entity27 ... @entity198 sent a man to the moon			1
big stuff that happens in history is being done by the federal government , not by people just carping about it all the time			2
" @entity179 continued : " this sort of gutting mentality that the @entity48 has , a kind of visceral hatred of the federal government , it comes out of a lack of historical understanding and appreciation			2
" calling @entity31 and @entity27 " wildly successful programs , " @entity179 said that the @entity37 has been trying roll them back for decades			1
" i think if they 're given a magic wand , they would melt them away			0
" and @entity179 had a warning and prediction			0
" not just congressman @entity34 , but if the main @entity37 candidate for president said he wants to shut down @entity31 and @entity27 , if that happened , welcome to the second @entity40 term			1
