there is no jarring video of a man clocking his fiancee in a casino elevator , no images of " switch " marks left on a small boy 's thighs			0
still , @entity12 's arrest on a misdemeanor domestic violence - related charge is a serious issue for the @entity15 as it marks the first real test of the league 's new personal conduct policy			1
authorities responded to the @entity22 defensive end 's home monday morning after receiving a call about a disturbance , according to a news release from @entity26 , @entity27 , police			0
" upon arrival , officers met with a 22 - year - old female who was observed bleeding from her left ear , having an earring ripped from her ear , and scratch marks to her face , " the release said			1
lt. @entity38 noted that @entity12 disputed the woman 's account , and in a statement provided to @entity3 , attorney @entity41 said , " @entity12 is concerned about working to clear his good name which he has established on and off the football field			1
... friends of mr. @entity12 's pulled together and rallied around their friend , whom they know as ' @entity12 , ' who has done much when asked for people around him here in the @entity52 area			1
" later tuesday , another attorney , @entity53 , sent a statement saying he was " confident an investigation and a full hearing of the facts will reveal that @entity12 behaved appropriately given the circumstances and in no way committed domestic violence or battery			1
" he said the woman threatened @entity12 and four others , including @entity12 's girlfriend , with a knife			1
she had her earring ripped out when a " dog reacting to her yelling jumped on her , " @entity53 said in his statement			1
" this was not domestic violence for many reasons , including the fact that the woman with the knife is not in a relationship with mr. @entity12 nor do they live together			1
also , there was there was no battery committed by mr. @entity12 , " the statement said			2
the relationship between the woman , who police have not identified , and @entity12 is unclear			1
the woman told police she had lived with @entity12 for two years , doing chores and running errands for him , but had been asked to leave monday morning , police said			2
@entity12 told police , though , that the woman was a dancer who was supposed to leave his home sunday night but was allowed to stay until monday morning			2
" there are some varying versions of what occurred , " @entity38 said during a monday news conference			0
' then i grabbed a knife ... ' according to the woman 's side of the story , she woke @entity12 up to request cab fare and he told his cousin and former @entity105 teammate @entity104 " to take care of the request , " police said			1
@entity38 read to reporters the woman 's account of what happened next : " we started arguing and @entity12 pushed me			1
he pushed me two times , trying to get me out the house and i fell down and they both was on me and i could n't breathe			0
i could n't fight both of them , then @entity104 picked me up and put me out			0
i started to dial 911 and @entity104 took my phone and would n't give it back			0
then i grabbed a knife because i thought they were going to jump me again			0
" @entity12 , 26 , was arrested on a charge of simple battery involving domestic violence , and @entity104 , 26 , was arrested on a simple battery charge			1
@entity12 posted a preset bond of $ 600 and @entity126 posted a $ 300 bond , and both were released from jail monday , according to police			1
@entity12 is scheduled to appear in @entity131 on february 26 , @entity38 told @entity3			2
the incident report will not be released until thursday or later , @entity38 said , but the responding officers had no option but to arrest @entity12 and @entity126 , given the circumstances			2
among the factors they considered , according to @entity38 : two large men were fighting with one woman , the nature of each party 's offensive and defensive injuries , the seriousness of the injuries , and the heights and weights of the parties involved			2
' when you go hands on with someone , you 've gone too far , " the lieutenant said , explaining that the initial investigation indicated @entity12 and @entity104 were the " predominant aggressors			0
" asked about @entity12 's claim that he merely wanted the woman to leave his home , @entity38 said , " all you had to do was call the @entity157 , and we would 've responded			1
" policy put to work @entity12 's arrest will be the first real test for the @entity15 's new personal conduct policy , adopted last month after widespread uproar over the handling of the @entity167 assault case and @entity169 child abuse case , along with other lower - profile arrests			1
the policy calls on players , coaches , owners , game officials and other employees to be " people of high character , " and it expands the 2007 list of prohibited conduct , allows for independent investigations , creates criteria under which a player can be suspended with pay and establishes a group of outside advisers to review potential violations			2
" conduct by anyone in the league that is illegal , violent , dangerous , or irresponsible puts innocent victims at risk , damages the reputation of others in the game , and undercuts public respect and support for the @entity15 , " the policy states			1
perhaps most pertinent to @entity12 's case , the policy also establishes a " baseline suspension without pay of six games " for any violation involving " assault , battery , domestic violence , dating violence , child abuse and other forms of family violence , or sexual assault involving physical force or committed against someone incapable of giving consent			1
" the suspension can be lengthened if the case involves aggravating factors , and a second offense could see a player banished from the league outright			0
@entity12 was apparently aware of this , as he told arresting officers the incident could affect his recent contract extension , @entity38 told @entity3			0
under the extension , signed in september , the @entity22 will pay the @entity229 - born defensive end with 31.5 career sacks as much as $ 52 million over six years , according to reports			0
he is slated to get a roster bonus of $ 12.5 million this year			0
" it had no bearing on our decision ( to arrest him ) , " @entity38 said of the contract			0
league , team investigating regarding @entity12 's status on the gridiron , a @entity22 spokesman told @entity3 on monday , " we are aware and our security department is still collecting information			2
" league spokesman @entity244 told @entity3 the @entity15 is looking into the matter and there was nothing new to report tuesday			0
he further explained how the league follows up on suspected violations , which includes making certain assistance available to the victim			0
for @entity12 , the @entity15 will offer and pay for a formal clinical evaluation , along with education and counseling , and if he participates , it will reflect positively " in determining eventual discipline if a violation is found , " according to the policy			1
the league will also conduct an investigation -- tapping @entity15 security , independent parties or both -- while cooperating with any law enforcement probes			2
" @entity238 and team employees are required to cooperate in any such investigation and are obligated to be fully responsive and truthful in responding to requests from investigators for information ( testimony , documents , physical evidence , or other information ) that may bear on whether the policy has been violated			0
" a failure to cooperate with an investigation or to be truthful in responding to inquiries will be separate grounds for disciplinary action			0
" @entity3 's @entity279 contributed to this report .			0
