-- the vast @entity1 in @entity2 is where the country 's finest delicacies are sold and auctioned , not only fish -- for which the market is famous -- but also fruit and vegetable			2

" ' @entity21 ' means @entity14 , ' shoku ' means ' to eat ' or ' meal ' or anything food - related , " explains cooking instructor and " washoku " enthusiast @entity20			1
for @entity14 , food is associated with many things			1
" first of all , it means happiness , the gathering , of being together , " @entity20 says			2
