-- the @entity2 administration said @entity3 has been " saber - rattling " over its threat to block the strategically important @entity5 and renewed its vow thursday to keep the corridor open			1
but the @entity10 's military underscored its intention thursday to undertake whatever military maneuvers it sees fit on the waterway			1
this is the latest in the recent war of words between the @entity16 and @entity3 over the strait			1
it started when @entity20 's vice president this week warned that the country could block the strait if sanctions are imposed on its exports of crude oil			2
the @entity25 based in @entity26 countered that " any disruption will not be tolerated			0
" the shipping channel leads in and out of the @entity29 between @entity3 on one coast and @entity31 and the @entity32 on the other			2
it is strategically important because tankers carrying oil travel through it			0
an @entity2 administration official , speaking on background because of the sensitivity of the issue , said the government has been " committed to @entity29 security for decades and it should come as no surprise to anyone that we 'll do what we must to ensure the strait remains open			1
gen. @entity53 , deputy commander of @entity3 's @entity54 , said his country " asks for no other country 's permission for the implementation of its defense strategies , " state - run @entity51 reported on thursday			1
on wednesday , @entity3 's navy commander rear admiral @entity60 said , " @entity3 has total control over the strategic water way , " adding that , " closing the @entity5 is very easy for @entity3 naval forces			2
" the vice president , @entity64 , issued his threat on tuesday			0
" @entity3 has repeatedly warned that in the event of a military attack on the country , it will not hesitate in taking all necessary measures to protect its sovereignty one of which would be to close the strategic oil passage , " @entity51 said in its report			2
the administration official stressed that " the saber - rattling is really all on the @entity3 side			1
" @entity3 has been holding a 10 - day military exercise in an area from the eastern part of the strait out into the @entity81			1
@entity83 diplomats describe the maneuvers as further evidence of @entity3 's volatile behavior			0
@entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 have proposed sanctions to punish @entity3 's lack of cooperation on its nuclear program			1
western powers believe @entity3 is intent on building nuclear weapons , but @entity3 says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes			1
physically closing the strait would require means that likely are not available to @entity3 , said professor @entity99 of @entity100			1
" at best , @entity3 can posture and potentially disrupt traffic for a short duration , " said @entity99 , who specializes in global trade and maritime transportation issues			0
@entity99 told @entity0 that any move by @entity3 to close the strait would be " suicidal " to the current regime			2
in 2009 , 15 million barrels of oil passed through the strait every day , according to the @entity110			0
" keep in mind that countries such as @entity114 and @entity115 are more dependent on @entity29 oil than the @entity16 , " the professor said			0
about 18 % of @entity16 net petroleum imports come from the @entity29 , while @entity118 provides 25 % , according to @entity99			0
the scholar , who has written extensively about oil " chokepoints , " said there are no other means to move large quantities of oil over long distance than by maritime transportation			0
" it is thus an international issue where the @entity16 , for strategic and historical reasons , is spearheading its security , " @entity99 said			0
@entity0 's @entity130 and @entity131 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity16 will do " what we must " to keep the strait open , official says
@entity3 says it will do what it sees fit for its defense
@entity142 wants *tougher* sanctions on @entity3 over its nuclear program
