-- tax day got you down ? now is your chance to flee society			1
be you a survivalist , an environmentalist or a cheapskate - ist , you can join the growing movement of @entity11 embracing off - grid living			1
" there 's a desire to step out of the rat race , and in @entity19 , that goes very deep in the national psyche , " says @entity13 , author of " off the grid : inside the movement for more space , @entity23 , and @entity24 in @entity19 " and editor of www.off-grid.net			1
" you know , the pioneering spirit and sturdy self - reliance -- these things which define the @entity32 character			1
" for some off - griders , it 's a matter of having little or no impact on the environment -- literally living off the power grid			1
this lifestyle has been championed by celebrities @entity40 and @entity41 then there are those who no longer want to be a blip on the societal radar			1
" off - grid living is a spectrum that unites greens and survivalists , " says @entity13 , referring to those who choose to escape city life because they either do n't trust the government or do n't want it meddling in their affairs			1
so if you 've been considering going @entity56 , let tax day be your inspiration			1
and if you 've got what it takes to look after yourself , with a little help from some earthy friends , here are a few off - the - grid destinations that will take you in			1
or perhaps you 'd like to drop in for a visit ... @entity66 , @entity67 there 's no shortage of songs about this fabled @entity67 ghost town on the edge of @entity73 , chock full of desert gypsies occupying the remaining mining ruins			1
but perhaps the most well known is @entity77 's " @entity76 " : well , you know we 're probably too old for this			1
/ maybe the rest of the world is too young			2
/ we drive 500 miles to get loose and get wild / and stay up ' til the last song is done			2
of course it 's hard to tell just how young or old anyone is in @entity66			2
desert living takes its toll on your skin while rejuvenating the soul			1
@entity66 is surrounded by ruggedly beautiful terrain , sits at a high altitude and a distance from civilization that provides for some of the world 's finest star - gazing and plays host to two of the most celebrated and highly attended chili cook - offs in the country			2
if you are n't ready to escape to the wilds of @entity67 , at least plan a trip for the first saturday of november , when both the @entity103 and the @entity105 cook - offs take place			2
and make sure to spend a night at upstairs at the mansion -- a boutique hotel built in the ruins of the century - old mansion owned by the founder of the @entity113 for more information , visit www.terlinguacitylimits.com or www.chili.org			2
@entity115 , @entity116 " @entity121 in @entity19 " is about 190 miles southeast of @entity117 and an hour 's drive north of the @entity120 border			2
here , in @entity115 , you 'll find hundreds of free spirits living in campers , rvs and school buses scattered amongst the giant concrete - slab ruins of a @entity129 - era military base			1
when the base closed after the war , a group of servicemen stayed , and the community continued to grow -- mostly because it supports the wayward life , and neither the @entity32 military nor the state of @entity116 have ever charged the squatters			2
keep in mind there 's no water , electricity or sewer service , so the lifestyle presents its own challenges			2
you might recognize the village of mobile homes or the nearby " @entity148 " from the 2007 film " @entity150 " or the book of the same name that inspired it			0
illuminated by a vision from @entity156 , @entity154 spent 26 years and thousands of gallons of paint crafting a hillside out of adobe and straw			0
the giant art installation is an explosion of colors and scriptures and such a spectacular vision that an unsuspecting traveler might think it a mirage			0
it 's worth the trip just to see the giant work of art or to take a life lesson from some of the locals making their own way in this concrete @entity177			0
@entity178 , @entity179 in the heart of the @entity181 lies a commune dedicated to socially and environmentally sustainable living			1
located on 280 acres in @entity184 , in northeastern @entity179 , dancing rabbit inhabitants aim to prove that egalitarian communities can thrive in @entity19			1
but the main focus is on the environment , as much of the property is reserved for wildlife habitat and villagers have reintroduced native plants to the area			0
if you 're just looking to stop in and check out the scene , stay at the @entity196 , a straw - bale - constructed bed and breakfast			0
dancing rabbit also offers one - to three - week visitor programs to more fully experience the ecovillage			0
most of those program participants camp on the property			0
for more information , visit www.dancingrabbit.org or www.milkweedmercantile.com			0
@entity207 , @entity208 for more than 300 years , the residents of this @entity211 waterman community have managed to exist without local government , jails or police			1
the methodist church and the blue crab business give the community its structure			0
not only have islanders preserved a sense of order , but they 've also upheld a unique way of life and dialect similar to that of the @entity226 of @entity227			0
the assortment of islands known as @entity207 can only be accessed by boat , and many are uninhabited			0
if you 're not looking to take up island life permanently , you should at least visit for the outstanding seafood and their signature eight - to - 15 - layer @entity207 cake			0
for more information , visit @entity238			0
@entity239 , @entity240 this holistic hot spring resort nestled in the @entity242 , 50 miles outside of @entity243 , @entity240 , is one of the most relaxing spots to go off the grid			1
you can join the 50 to 70 members of this worker - owned cooperative who run @entity249 by lending your skills for a year , at which point the community will vote on your membership			0
the community 's mission : " to provide a safe and potent environment where people can renew and evolve in ways they never imagined			0
" of course , if you just want a short rejuvenation escape , you can make reservations for anywhere from $ 52 to $ 119 a night , depending on dates and accommodations			0
visitors can enjoy massages , performances , yoga , more than 20 miles of hiking trails and the renowned natural geothermal springs that have been used by @entity11 for centuries			1
for more information , visit @entity272 .			0

if going *mainstream* is weighing you down , consider these five spots
residents of a @entity179 *eco-village* are committed to sustainable living
a hot springs co-op in @entity240 *encourages* *personal* growth and renewal
