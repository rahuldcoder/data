after the deadly shooting at @entity1 , the message from one of the most decorated athletes in @entity6 sports history -- who is @entity7 -- was clear			1
" most muslims do not become @entity7 to indulge in murder and mayhem , " @entity9 , the leading point scorer in @entity11 history , told @entity8 's @entity12 on wednesday			1
" it 's not what @entity16 is about			1
" we try to live lives of peace and harmony within ourselves and with our neighbors			0
" @entity9 -- also a best - selling author who was in @entity23 promoting a pair of new books including a fictional work about @entity28 ' brother -- was speaking a week after brothers @entity29 and @entity31 killed 12 people at the @entity34 satirical magazine			1
@entity34 media reported that the gunmen yelled , " we have avenged the @entity37 " while carrying out the attack , referring to the @entity39			2
@entity40 , who reportedly had ties to the brothers , killed four hostages at a kosher grocery store two days later			0
@entity9 , in a column for the website of @entity46 last week , said he was looking forward to the day when " these terrorists praising the @entity37 ( @entity39 ) or @entity49 's name as they debase their actual teachings are instantly recognized as thugs disguising themselves as @entity7			1
" he added to @entity8 that poverty or lack of opportunities in education are factors in people committing such acts			2
" they become radicalized by the lack of opportunity and anything in their future that has any promise , " he said			0
they try to use religion as something to justify that			0
" as someone who was in the public eye through sports , @entity9 feels sports can play a role in bringing people from different backgrounds together			1
" sport absolutely plays a part in that , " he said			0
" when you spend all of your time trying to develop the talent for a sport and you see people doing the same thing from a different culture and you have the same interests , there 's common ground there			1
" and you can go from that to find more common ground			0
i think sport has gone a great way to doing that			0
look at the @entity6 - @entity103 relationship -- ping - pong was the thing that opened the door			2
" but @entity9 also said it was down to the media to understand @entity16 better			1
" i 'd just like to see a better understanding by the media as to what @entity16 is all about as opposed to what the terrorists say it 's about , " he continued			2
" i think that is the key issue here			0
once those things get cleared up , i think we can make some progress			0

@entity9 says " most @entity7 do not become @entity7 to indulge in murder and mayhem "
his words come after last week 's @entity1 attack and hostage *crisis* in @entity127
sports can play a role in *bridging* the gap between people , says @entity9 - @entity9
