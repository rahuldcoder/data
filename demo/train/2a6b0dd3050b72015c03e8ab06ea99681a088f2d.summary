@entity0 , @entity1 -- nearly six years ago , i left @entity4 to move back home to @entity1			1
i must have been the only one			0
@entity7 data released this week confirm that , during the last decade , the tide was definitely going the other way			0
the @entity4 was the undisputed winner in the 2010 population sweepstakes			1
its prize : more congressional seats awarded through reapportionment than any other state			1
@entity4 added four @entity17 seats and increased its number of electoral votes to 38			1
that will be second only to @entity1 , which has 55 electoral votes			0
@entity1 , which grew rapidly through the 20th century , only increased at the national average in the past 10 years			0
it did n't add any @entity17 seats this year			1
the other winners in the census lottery include @entity26 , which picked up two new seats in @entity28			2
@entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 all picked up one extra seat			0
it is a much bleaker story in @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 , which lost seats			2
why did you move -- or stay -- in the last few years ? tell us on @entity47 ! it makes for quite a sea change			0
we are seeing the transfer of influence and prominence away from what has long been considered the power corridor of @entity55 , @entity34 and @entity38 and toward the @entity56			0
@entity4 is the buckle in that belt			2
if you want to catch a glimpse of the future , you do n't go to @entity62 or @entity63 or @entity64			0
you go to @entity65 , @entity66 or @entity67			0
a generation or two ago , @entity68 left the @entity70 and headed west to @entity1 in search of the @entity72 , milder climate , bountiful farmland and a spirit of tolerance			1
now , they 're still leaving the @entity70 -- but also leaving @entity1 -- to head to @entity4 in pursuit of lower taxes , less government regulation , lower home prices and a spirit of independence			1
i have plenty of friends and family in @entity4 , and they have good reason to celebrate this holiday season			2
after all , this is a place that is used to coming in second			2
@entity4 is the second - largest state in area , behind @entity93			1
and it 's the second-most populous state next to @entity1			0
but in terms of population growth , it 's second to none			2
@entity4 is a beautiful and extremely livable state , with scenic vistas and hospitable people			1
but somewhere in its bloodstream , there is an inferiority complex			0
it 's just as well that my friends in @entity107 can fly to @entity108 or @entity38 in just a few hours , because the city is always aspiring to be thought of as being sophisticated as @entity108 and @entity38			0
while some pundits are saying that this population shift to the @entity112 is good news for @entity114 , i 'm not so sure that 's true			1
@entity4 is still a red state , but there is some evidence that it 's trending purple			1
election results confirm that @entity121 and @entity122 , which includes @entity66 , are home to more democrats than they used to be			0
there is still a lot of red in the panhandle and western @entity4 , to be sure			2
but demographics do n't lie			0
you ca n't talk honestly about population growth in @entity4 without acknowledging two things			1
first , much of it is coming from transplants from blue states such as @entity1			0
they are packing up preformed liberal tendencies and taking them into the land of the blue bonnets			0
according to the @entity140 , an average of 80,000 @entity1 moved to @entity4 each year from 2006 to 2008			2
second , much of the rest of @entity4 ' population growth is tied to the phenomenal increase in the @entity145 population			1
that 's another subset that tends to lean left politically			0
according to @entity148 , a demographer with the @entity149 , @entity147 made up more than half the new arrivals to @entity4			2
the same goes for @entity29 , @entity26 and @entity31			0
the larger story likely to come out of the 2010 census is that the @entity145 population is exploding			1
the data showing the racial / ethnic breakdown of the @entity68 population wo n't be released until february			1
but already there is reasonable speculation that the @entity145 population could be somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 million , or about 19 percent of the total @entity68 population , which is now 308.7 million			1
and in @entity4 , @entity147 will likely account for nearly 40 percent of the state 's population			1
there is no question that , as a result of the population shifts of the past 10 years , @entity4 and states out @entity169 are coming into their own and will have more power and influence to steer a new course for the country			1
but who will these states be steered by ? whom do you think ? welcome to the new @entity68			2
or should i say , " bienvenidos ? " the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181			0

@entity68 census shows growth in @entity112 , with @entity4 gaining quickly
@entity4 is gaining four seats in @entity17 , the most of any state
he says people are coming in search of lower taxes , less regulation , *cheaper* *housing*
growth of @entity145 population is a major factor driving increase in @entity4 , he says
