-- @entity2 footballer @entity1 accused @entity5 football 's governing body of not taking racism seriously enough after the @entity8 @entity7 was fined us $ 105,000 following an under - 21 match where opposing @entity2 players said they were racially abused			1
" uefa are not serious at all on racism			0
fines do not work at all			0
they have zero impact on federations / clubs / fans / players , " @entity1 wrote on @entity14			0
on thursday , @entity11 issued various punishments to both @entity8 and @entity2 following incidents that broke out after their under - 21 teams met in a 2013 @entity26 qualifier in october			1
in addition to banning two @entity8 coaches as well as a total of six players from both sides , @entity11 also ordered the eastern @entity5 to play their next competitive under - 21 match behind closed doors			1
in chaotic scenes at the end of the match in the @entity8 city @entity39 , @entity2 defender @entity34 was sent off for kicking the ball away in response to what he said was racist and physical abuse -- while fans , coaches and other players also clashed			2
@entity1 -- whose brother was at the center of a racism row involving @entity52 defender @entity51 -- suggested that @entity11 should contact the current generation of footballers to discuss ways to eradicate racism within @entity5 football			2
" @entity11 need to talk to this generation ...			0
. they do n't seem to be up to date on this issue ? ? harsh punishments needed as a deterrent , " said the 34 - year - old @entity61 player			0
@entity11 's punishment of the @entity8 @entity7 falls short of the $ 125,800 fine it handed to @entity67 international @entity66 for exposing boxer shorts adorned with the logo of an online betting company during the 2012 @entity71			1
the @entity7 , which banned @entity51 for four matches in september following his racial abuse of @entity75 defender @entity74 in a match last year , backed the elder @entity1 's viewpoint , agreeing that the punishment should have been tougher			2
" we are disappointed with the sanctions levied by @entity11 with regards to the racist behavior displayed towards @entity2 's players , " @entity7 general secretary @entity79 said in a statement			1
" let 's be clear , racism is unacceptable in any form , and should play no part in football			0
the scenes were deplorable and we do not believe the sanction sends a strong enough message			0
" @entity79 added that the @entity7 is set to appeal the two - year and one - year bans handed out to @entity94 and @entity95 respectively , with both players set to miss the opening matches of next year 's @entity98			2
@entity8 's assistant coach @entity99 and fitness coach @entity100 received two - year suspensions from football , with both able to return to the game sooner if they avoid similar incidents during their bans			0
following the scuffles that broke out after @entity2 had booked their qualification for the 2013 @entity71 with a 2 - 0 aggregate wins , the @entity8 players to be banned are @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114			1
earlier this year , @entity115 were infuriated after being fined $ 40,000 by @entity11 for taking to the pitch late for a @entity118 game - which was $ 13,000 more than @entity120 's sanction for fans ' racist abuse during a game against the @entity125 club .			1
