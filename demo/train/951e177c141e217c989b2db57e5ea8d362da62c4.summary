-- @entity1 has a dream : to see the titans of @entity4 trade their palatial office suites for a row of dank prison cells			2
stealing billion - dollar , taxpayer - funded bailouts			2
getting rich on your dime while you struggle to make ends meet			0
and if you 're tired of standing by while the rich get richer and the middle class crumbles , he has a suggestion : take it to the streets			0
@entity1 , 21 and unemployed , has suddenly become one of several unofficial spokesmen for @entity22 , a leaderless protest movement made largely of twenty - somethings upset with the state of the economy , the state of the war in @entity28 , the state of the environment , and the state of @entity31 and the world in general			1
if that sounds vague , it 's meant to be			1
in less than three weeks , the movement has become a magnet for countless disaffected @entity31			1
and at a time when an overwhelming majority of @entity31 say the country 's on the wrong track , there 's no shortage of new potential recruits			1
photos : ' @entity22 ' protests on saturday , more than 700 protesters were arrested for blocking the @entity47			1
a splinter group called @entity49 touted a " huge afternoon march			0
" in @entity54 , 34 groups -- unions and other organizations focused on everything from foreclosure prevention to climate change -- marched for " an economy that works for all of us , " according to one website			0
over on the @entity62 , @entity61 kicked off with a march to @entity64			0
in @entity66 , demonstrators touted " a leaderless resistance movement with people of many colors ( and ) genders			1
" on monday , a live video feed from @entity22 was featured at the start of a three - day conference of progressive leaders in @entity75			1
what does it all mean ? " we 're here for different reasons , " said @entity1 , whose father is also unemployed and recently went through a home foreclosure			0
" but at the end of the day , it all boils down to one thing , and that 's accountability			1
we want accountability for the connection between @entity4 and the politicians			0
" " something has to change , " he told @entity0			0
" we 're out here because we 're tired of what 's been going on			1
" @entity95 , a 46 - year - old freelance photographer and father of two , echoes @entity1 's call for greater accountability			1
" people have simply had enough , " @entity95 said			0
" we 're living in an age where the inequality between high - end @entity4 and the ( rest of us ) is simply a gap that has become too big			0
millions of people have lost their jobs			0
millions of people have lost their homes			0
" there 's been , @entity95 said , " way too much cloak - and - dagger activity within the corridors of @entity4 " in recent years			1
" this is about raising awareness and a change of political discourse			0
" the average person , according to @entity1 , " is just fed up because there 's no more middle class			1
the margin between us and the employers is so great now			0
where will we be in a couple of years ? " does he actually want to occupy @entity4 and shut it down ? " we want to educate people , " @entity1 said			0
but " if @entity4 actually shuts down , we 'll be happy about it			0
" the movement " feels like something that will ultimately spread like the @entity127 , " said @entity124 , a @entity125 in @entity75			1
" i call it the @entity31 autumn			1
" @entity22 and its offshoots have clear strains of liberal economic populism -- a powerful force in @entity31 history during various times characterized by growing economic stress			1
that said , it could be a mistake to label or tie the movement to a specific agenda , said @entity141 , a @entity142 sociology professor			1
" it 's difficult to classify a social protest movement early on in its history , " @entity141 told @entity0			1
" clearer goals could eventually emerge , but there 's no guarantee			2
" " many movements fizzle out			0
others become more organized , " she said			0
but " i think we run a risk ( by ) taking a snapshot at any one point in time , and trying to categorize the movement in any one way based on that snapshot			2
the only way to study these protest movements is to follow them over time			2
" if @entity1 , willies and @entity95 have their way , there will be plenty of time for this movement to continue to grow and evolve			2
some observers question if it could become a liberal counterweight to the conservative populism of the tea party			0
for his part , @entity95 predicts the movement will go international in the next few months			2
" let 's get talking , " he urged			2
" let 's have some of these issues looked at			1
" @entity0 's @entity178 and @entity179 contributed to this report .			2
