-- as recently as six years ago , it was conventional wisdom among lawyers , legislators and policy advocates that the states had no role in setting immigration policy			1
since then , there has been a federalist revolution of historic proportions			0
one - third of the states now mandate that some employers enroll in the federal employment verification program , e-verify			1
seven states require it of all but the smallest employers			2
five have enacted policing laws similar to @entity23 's @entity22 that allow local police to inquire about the immigration status of people they stop for other reasons who they suspect are in the country illegally			1
no wonder the @entity32 is weighing in , hearing arguments this week on the @entity35 's challenge to @entity22			1
refereeing turf battles between @entity37 and the states is one of the court 's first responsibilities			2
the court is considering and will eventually rule on one very particular , polarizing state stratagem			0
that does n't come across as impartial refereeing			0
whatever the outcome , it will feel like judges making policy -- either endorsing or outlawing police questions about immigration status			1
if the justices are going to encourage federalism , i 'd like to see them encourage it more evenhandedly , opening the way to a broader array of state initiatives , including those that go beyond enforcement			2
those who want @entity37 to make immigration policy have a hundred years of history and a raft of persuasive arguments on their side			1
the @entity69 reserves some powers for @entity71 : naturalization and , by extension , determining who and how many immigrants we admit			0
federal law carves out other areas , including most worksite enforcement			1
and sheer practicality argues for one national policy on the border			2
but after five years of federal paralysis , with @entity37 still unable to act to fix the immigration system , it 's understandable that states have been taking matters into their own hands			1
the laws have come in waves : one state tries something , others follow			0
the first waves were all enforcement measures : voters and lawmakers trying anything to get control , first by regulating landlords , then limiting hiring , then using local police and even public school teachers to inquire about people 's immigration status			2
but recently , a handful of states have tried to go beyond enforcement			2
@entity109 pioneered the new path			0
three - part legislation passed in spring 2011 combined an @entity23 - like policing measure with a state - run guest worker program to bring in legal workers from @entity115 , plus an initiative to grant work permits to unauthorized immigrants already living and working in @entity109			2
this year , lawmakers in five other states as different as @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity115 , @entity123 and @entity124 floated similar worker authorization bills			2
legislators in many states express interest in guest worker programs			2
it 's not just immigrant rights advocates who are driving the measures -- many are backed by surprising coalitions			0
in some instances , business is engaged			0
even in the downturn , farmers , nonfarm seasonal employers and other industries that rely on physical labor need immigrants to do jobs for which there are few willing and able @entity146			0
in some states , the sponsors are pragmatic conservatives			1
@entity151 state sen. @entity150 of @entity109 is as eager as @entity23 's enforcement - minded sheriffs to get control of illegal immigration			2
but @entity150 believes it will take a combination of enforcement and realism about the unauthorized population			0
" most are n't going home , " he says , " no matter what we do			0
and the states are stuck with the costs			0
we have to educate , medicate and incarcerate them			0
but we ca n't let them work			0
it 's the biggest unfunded mandate in history			0
" what 's different in the states is that this kind of pragmatism can break through , and lawmakers are n't afraid to try experiments , even unlikely bipartisan experiments like @entity109 's worker authorization program			0
the problem for @entity109 is that the @entity179 administration , determined to limit states ' rights and keep the lid on state immigration enforcement , has n't let the state implement any of its initiatives			1
unlike states pursuing enforcement alone , states seeking to combine enforcement with other measures ca n't simply take matters into their own hands			1
a state - run guest worker program ca n't bring legal workers across the border without cooperation from federal authorities			1
and without permission from @entity37 , a state - run worker authorization initiative would leave employers and employees dangerously vulnerable to federal immigration enforcement			1
the result is a dramatic asymmetry in the experiments in immigration policy being conducted in the laboratories of democracy			1
it 's no accident that the @entity32 , which many observers see as inclined to encourage state initiatives , is about to consider the merits of yet another enforcement measure			1
how do we get off this narrow path ? how do we break the logjam where @entity71 is paralyzed , creative state lawmakers are stymied and the only people implementing new immigration policy are those seeking to use draconian enforcement to drive immigrants out of the @entity146 -- a theory known as attrition through enforcement ? personally , i hope the @entity32 will strike down the @entity23 law and put the responsibility back on @entity71 ' shoulders			1
but if it does n't -- if the justices decide to empower the states -- i hope they and the administration will open the door as widely as possible , with the court ruling broadly to free the states , and the administration cooperating with some constructive state experiments			1
as many state lawmakers are starting to grasp , the best antidote to illegal immigration is a legal immigration system that works			0
let them experiment -- as freely as possible			0
over time , their experimentation just may point the way for @entity71			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity248			1

@entity248 : in recent years many states have taken issue of immigration into their own hands
she says when @entity32 rules on @entity22 it will be making a judgment on federalism
she says states that have tried pragmatic *approaches* run up against federal immigration law
@entity248 : @entity22 should fall , but if not , ruling should let states experiment on immigration policy
