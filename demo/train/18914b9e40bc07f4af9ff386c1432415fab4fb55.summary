-- the fog has been lifted			0
there is no serious doubt left that @entity4 is " now directly involved in the fighting " in @entity7 , as @entity5 , @entity6 ambassador in @entity7 has said on @entity8			1
" @entity4 supplied tanks , armored vehicles , artillery and multiple rocket launchers have been insufficient to defeat @entity7 ' armed forces			1
so now an increasing number of @entity4 troops are intervening directly in fighting on @entity7 territory			1
@entity4 has also sent its newest air defense systems including the @entity20 into eastern @entity7 , " he wrote			1
this is the step from proxy war to war			1
it is also probably the end of @entity28 chancellor @entity27 's attempts to prevent the worst through diplomacy			1
she spoke to @entity4 president @entity31 more than 30 times this year on the phone , much more often than any other @entity35 leader			2
what @entity28 tried was to convince @entity31 to step back from war in eastern @entity7 by using carrots and sticks : western economic sanctions on the one hand , and on the other the promise of a return to a close partnership with the @entity35 if @entity4 were to stop supporting separatists in @entity7			1
for @entity49 , which was in the lead in @entity35 negotiations with @entity4 , the goal of the talks was to give @entity31 a face - saving exit option that would n't look like a defeat			1
but for @entity55 , those talks were meant to achieve @entity4 's goal -- control over @entity7			1
while @entity4 talked about " federalization " , which was meant to give regions a veto over the country 's core political decisions , @entity28 talked about " decentralization , " a system of administration that would leave the capital in control of @entity7			1
@entity31 's choices @entity28 tactics were built on @entity4 deniability of any direct involvement			2
the diplomatic game was based on the pretense that both sides were not much more than concerned neighbors , that @entity4 was not part of the conflict			1
but indirect involvement was not enough to hold territory in @entity7			0
that 's why @entity31 either had to accept defeat or to step up his efforts and end the pretense of @entity4 non-involvement			2
@entity31 did so knowing that this would lead to more @entity35 sanctions , more costs for @entity4			0
but he may have gambled that the @entity35 would not massively increase sanctions , as the appetite for conflict with @entity4 is low in many @entity93 countries , especially in @entity94			1
it is also possible that he may even be ready to accept economic divorce with the @entity35			0
the @entity35 has tried everything to convince @entity31 to step back from the brink of open war in @entity7			2
but it has not worked			0
the success of the @entity7 army on the ground has forced @entity4 to make a choice between ending efforts to bring back @entity7 under @entity55 's control -- or moving to open war			1
@entity31 had to leave the fog and make a move			0
the @entity28 approach now looks like a failure , but it was worth trying nevertheless			0
diplomatic efforts may also have kept @entity4 involvement to a minimum in the last few months -- they may have caused @entity31 to keep a low profile , thus allowing @entity118 to recover and win back territory			2
a pause in diplomacy the @entity35 has no " @entity132 " @entity27 's carrot and stick approach had the great advantage of being " sellable " domestically : to her coalition partner in @entity28 , @entity124 , and in the @entity125 to countries like @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 , which are much less concerned about @entity4 neo-imperialism than @entity28 or @entity131			2
more robust tactics wo n't fly in @entity28 or in the wider @entity125			0
anything that appears to raise the risk of direct military confrontation with @entity4 will be vetoed			0
the only possible option now is to increase sanctions			0
diplomacy will take a pause			0
and every hope of a return to the way relations with @entity4 used to be will be buried			0
what is clear now is that @entity4 and @entity94 are heading towards a much less cordial relationship			1
the next few years are going to be characterized by a mix of confrontation and cooperation			0
the @entity35 's grand strategy of transforming @entity4 into a liberal democracy by weaving it into a web of interconnectedness has failed			2
by moving from proxy war to open war , by giving up pretense and deniability in @entity7 , @entity4 has very clearly made that point			1
@entity28 has taken the lead in the crisis because it has become a central player in @entity94 , and because it had a lot at stake			0
its attempts to put the genie back in the bottle were ultimately unsuccessful			0
but in that process , @entity49 has taken responsibility for @entity35 relations with @entity4			2
it should now take the lead on the long game as well : by building a new strategy that balances confrontation where necessary with cooperation where possible .			0

the @entity6 this week said @entity4 forces were " directly involved " in fighting in @entity7
@entity182 writes that this moves the eastern @entity7 conflict from a proxy war to war
it also likely ends @entity49 's attempts to use diplomatic means to prevent the worst , he says
@entity182 says @entity4 and @entity94 are now heading towards a much less cordial relationship
