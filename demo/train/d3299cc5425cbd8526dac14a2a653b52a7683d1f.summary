-- almost a century ago @entity1 , the founder of @entity2 , said that the only international language the whole world understands is the cry of a child			0
now , as we start the 500 - day countdown to the deadline for the @entity11 and prepare to mark @entity12 on tuesday , i am not so sure			2
having done far too little to stop children and their schools from becoming instruments of war in @entity17 , we have also been slow to respond to the plight of the @entity20 children of @entity21 , utterly incapable of providing basic health and education for a million child refugees exiled from @entity25 and appear powerless to rescue the @entity27 schoolgirls abducted by the @entity29 terrorist group whose aim is to stop girls going to school			2
all of this despite international legislation , including the @entity35 , the 1949 @entity36 and more generally the @entity37 , the conventions on children and the excellent recommendations from @entity41 that the @entity42 should pay special attention to the abuses of children 's rights in conflict zones , including the misuse of schools			1
now today , exactly 500 days out from december 31 , 2015 -- the point at which we all promised to achieve universal education for all children , there are still 58 million children who never go to school , millions of them unable to do so because they are condemned to child labour , child marriage , child trafficking or , in the case of girls , medieval forms of discrimination			1
round the world young people are starting to see the blindingly - obvious connection between boys and girls shelled in @entity17 , the schoolgirls abducted in @entity27 , the @entity25 refugees without a home , millions of children denied basic rights -- including the right to education across the world -- and the rape of girls in @entity77 , the forced marriages of 9 and 10 year olds in @entity80 , the genital mutilation of their counterparts in @entity83 and across @entity84 and the denial of girls ' basic rights in @entity88 and elsewhere			1
it all comes down to one basic truth : almost 70 years after the @entity37 , there is still an abject failure to take children 's rights seriously and , as the adult world vacillates its people themselves who are now becoming the most vociferous in their anger at the violations of their rights , beginning to see their freedom fight as a civil rights struggle and leading the charge for change			1
and what marks 2014 a turning point for children 's emancipation is the country - by country growth of civil rights groups led by young people themselves and , spurred by contact and communication across the @entity115 , their coordination under umbrella organizations such as @entity118 , fighting schoolgirl marriage ; the @entity120 , opposing child slavery ; and the @entity122 , championing the right to education for all boys and girls			1
young people 's groups , from @entity129 , fighting child labour in @entity77 ; to the @entity131 in @entity132 and the @entity134 school campaign in @entity135 have yet to trend on @entity136 and @entity137			1
opinion : @entity27 's kidnapped girls not forgotten girls fighting child slavery from the @entity143 forum in @entity144 and the 19 child marriage free zones in @entity80 have yet to become a major presence on our streets			0
but it will happen soon			0
and on monday 500 youth ambassadors representing all countries of the world will announce they will meet in @entity154 on september 22 and , shadowing the next day 's @entity155 of world leaders , they will attempt to force the rights of children onto the international agenda			1
they will argue hard , and they will be heard			0
this is not about asking and receiving			0
they are demanding their rights			2
they will demand that children should not be weapons of war and schools should never become theaters for prosecuting conflict			0
they will demand the @entity42 now properly police laws that ban the militarization of schools and , as called for in the @entity174 guidelines , the insertion of these obligations into doctrine and military manuals			2
they will demand that education should be a right across borders , with a universal obligation to offer all children education even in unstable environments -- and for the early removal of all barriers , from child labor and child marriage to sexual discrimination -- to this universal right			2
of course , what moves people to hear the anguish of the child is the plight of the most marginalized			0
but , sadly , it is always the weakest , the youngest and the most vulnerable -- the street child , the orphan , the trafficked girl , the isolated rural poor -- who remain neglected , forgotten and left behind			0
it is to reverse this injustice that we , the adult world who have done too little , must now support young people waging their own liberation struggle			1
it is not too late : we must , of course , use the next 500 days not just to be more attentive to the needs of the children of the world and to keep our promises but also to offer practical support to young people as youth ambassadors , young people 's representatives and new youth groups mobilize for this new struggle			1
for if the enduring image from a century ago is one of helpless children waiting to be protected and even pitied , then the image remembered by the next generation will be radically different			0
as young people connect , communicate with each other and assert their rights , the new " cry of a child " is less likely to be the shedding of tears and pleas for charity than defiant marches on our streets and a deafening clamor from young people themselves for justice			1
join us on @entity137 / @entity240 .			0

@entity242 : young people are demanding their rights and will be heard
