-- former @entity2 defense secretary @entity1 , a key architect of the @entity2 war in @entity4 under presidents @entity6 and @entity7 , has died at age 93 , according to his family			1
@entity1 took a lead role in managing the @entity2 military commitment in @entity4			1
@entity1 was a member of @entity6 's inner circle during the @entity13 in 1962 , when the @entity2 and the @entity14 stood on the brink of nuclear war			1
but he became a public lightning rod for his management of the war in @entity4 , overseeing the @entity2 military commitment there as it grew from fewer than 1,000 advisers to more than half a million troops			1
though the increasingly unpopular conflict was sometimes dubbed " @entity24 , " he later said both administrations were " terribly wrong " to have pursued military action beyond 1963			0
" external military force can not reconstruct a failed state , and @entity4 , during much of that period , was a failed state politically , " he told @entity0 in a 1996 interview for the " @entity29 " documentary series			1
" we did n't recognize it as such			0
" a native of @entity36 , @entity1 studied economics at the @entity38 and earned a master 's degree in business from @entity42			1
he was a staff officer in the @entity43 during @entity44 , when he studied the results of @entity2 bombing raids on @entity47 and @entity48 in search of ways to improve their accuracy and efficiency			0
after the war , he joined the @entity54 and became its president in november 1960 -- the first person to lead the company from outside its founding family			2
a month later , the newly elected @entity6 asked him to become secretary of defense , making him one of the " whiz kids " who joined the young president 's administration			1
in october 1962 , after the discovery of @entity14 nuclear missiles in @entity66 , @entity1 was one of @entity6 's top advisers in the standoff that followed			1
the @entity2 imposed a naval " quarantine " on @entity66 , a @entity14 ally , and prepared for possible airstrikes or an invasion			0
the @entity14 withdrew the missiles in exchange for a @entity2 guarantee not to invade @entity66 , a step that allowed @entity14 premier @entity76 to present the pullback as a success to his own people			0
in the 2003 documentary " @entity81 , " @entity1 told filmmaker @entity82 that the experience taught @entity2 policymakers to " put ourselves inside their skin and look at us through their eyes			2
" but he added , " in the end , we lucked out			0
it was luck that prevented nuclear war			2
" @entity1 is credited with using the management techniques he mastered as a corporate executive to streamline the @entity95 , computerizing and smoothing out much of the @entity2 military 's vast purchasing and personnel system			1
and in @entity4 , he attempted to use those techniques to measure the progress of the war			1
metrics such as use of " body counts " and scientific solutions such as using the herbicide @entity107 to defoliate jungles in which communist guerrillas hid became trademarks of the conflict			0
@entity1 made several trips to @entity4 to study the situation firsthand			1
he , @entity7 and other @entity2 officials portrayed the war as a necessary battle in the @entity29 , a proxy struggle to prevent communism from taking control of all of @entity119			0
but while they saw the conflict as another front in the standoff between the @entity2 and the @entity14 , which backed communist @entity124 , @entity1 acknowledged later that they underestimated @entity127 nationalism and opposition to the @entity2 - backed government in @entity130			2
" the conflict within @entity4 itself had all of the characteristics of a civil war , and we did n't look upon it as largely a civil war , and we were n't measuring our progress as one would have in what was largely a civil war , " he told @entity0			1
casualties mounted , as did domestic opposition to the war			0
in 1965 , a @entity145 anti-war protester , @entity144 , set himself on fire outside @entity1 's office window			1
in 1967 , tens of thousands of demonstrators marched on the @entity95 , which was ringed with troops			0
by november 1967 , @entity1 told @entity7 that there was " no reasonable way " to end the war quickly , and that the @entity2 needed to reduce its forces in @entity4 and turn the fighting over to the @entity2 - backed government in @entity130			1
by the end of that month , @entity7 announced he was replacing @entity157 at the @entity95 and moving him to the @entity158			0
but by march 1968 , @entity7 had reached virtually the same conclusion as @entity1			2
he issued a call for peace talks and announced he would not seek re-election			0
after leaving the @entity95 in early 1968 , @entity1 spent 12 years leading the @entity158			2
he said little publicly about @entity4 until the publication of a 1995 memoir , " in @entity165			2
" " you do n't know what i know about how inflammatory my words can appear , " he told @entity82			0
" a lot of people misunderstand the war , misunderstand me			0
a lot of people think i 'm a son of a bitch			0
