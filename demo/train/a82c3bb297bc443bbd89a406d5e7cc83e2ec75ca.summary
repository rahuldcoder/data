@entity0 -- on a recent trip home to @entity5 , i heard a @entity7 man on my flight remark to another passenger that he 'd taken his son on a tour of a @entity13 slum			1
i believe the man was well - intentioned -- he wanted his child , accustomed to a comfortable existence , to get a firsthand look at how millions of poor people live			1
later , i discovered that slum tours in @entity5 are often organized and can cost money			1
@entity21 takes tourists on slum and sightseeing tours in @entity25			1
a walking tour of @entity27 , @entity29 's largest slum , costs only $ 9			1
for about $ 135 , five people get a nine - hour car tour of @entity27 , the red light district of @entity33 , as well as other more traditional tourist areas			1
@entity21 founders say the tours were set up " primarily to show the positive side of the slums and break down negative stereotypes about its people and residents " who occupy cramped huts in unending stretches of squalor			1
they say 80 % of their profits go back to local communities through social service programs			2
that seems like a noble cause , but then i got to thinking about the idea of poverty tours in general -- how it might feel to be a slum - dweller coming face to face with a wealthy visitor gawking at me as though i were an animal in a zoo			1
therein lies the debate over such tours			1
@entity62 , the executive director of @entity63 , a social services organization in @entity64 , decried poverty tours of @entity67 's largest slum , @entity68			1
he wrote in the @entity69 that the tours do nothing to alleviate the problem			1
" slum tourism turns poverty into entertainment , something that can be momentarily experienced and then escaped from , " he said			1
" people think they 've really ' seen ' something -- and then go back to their lives and leave me , my family and my community right where we were before			2
" i decided to see for myself			2
when i was in @entity0 over the winter , i signed up for a walking tour in @entity85 , a neighborhood near the train station that i had always known as seedy			1
i 'd rushed through it once before in my life , when i had to spend a night after a train was delayed			2
it 's not unlike the many neighborhoods in @entity13 i know so well			2
the smell of turmeric and green chiles mixing with that of garbage and urine			2
it 's a hodgepodge of activity			2
children sleeping out in the open , a swarm of flies covering their unwashed faces			2
a maze of snaking alleyways and dark , dank corners			1
and people everywhere , entire families crowded into small rooms , sleeping on one bed			2
these were sights and sounds familiar to me , and i always considered myself immensely lucky to have lived outside of that world -- lucky , at least , to live in relative comfort			2
i was curious to see how tour operators presented @entity5 poverty , especially to foreigners			1
i picked one run by a nonprofit organization that works to improve the lives of street kids			1
this way , my money was going toward a good cause			2
" this is unlike other poverty tours , " says @entity128 , coordinator of the tours			1
" when people start interacting with the children , misconceptions about street life fall away			1
" i am asked to meet the guide from @entity137 at 10 a.m. @entity138 means hello and baalak means child			1
the tours are conducted by former street kids who were able to improve their lives through the organization			1
on this day , i am among a handful of people , all foreigners on the @entity148			2
our guide is a young man named @entity152 , who has been living on the streets since he ran away from home at 5			1
" can you guess why a child runs away from home ? " he asks us			1
" poverty , abuse , addiction			1
and sometimes , they think if they come to the city , they can become a @entity165 star			1
@entity152 continues and tells his own story			0
" my parents used to fight , " he says			0
" my father beat me			0
" so he ran away to the streets of @entity0			1
he spent nights terrified , alone and hungry on trains and in stations			0
he was beaten and abused , he says , by other street dwellers and even by the police			1
most of the boys work menial jobs or steal , he tells us			0
girls , he says , run away because their parents can not afford dowries to get them married , and they do n't want to be a burden to their families anymore			0
instead , they come to the city and sell their bodies to eat			1
the street kids have nowhere to keep their money			1
they spend whatever they earn , or it 's stolen while they sleep			0
@entity152 used to work at a recycling center			0
out of every 100 rupees ( $ 2.25 ) he earned , 75 went to the gangs who provided security			0
after that , he worked at a chai ( tea ) stall and then at a dhaba ( roadside eatery ) , where he did n't get paid but got something even better : food and shelter			0
@entity152 leads us from the main road into a lane			0
he shows us a recycling shop , like the one where he worked , where newspaper and glass bottles turn into money			0
we wander through the main market in @entity85 , assaulted by a panoply of goods -- handbags , sweaters , pots and pans , pirated cds and dvds , refurbished electronics , blankets , shoes			1
he takes us to one of @entity137 's shelters next to the bustling train station			1
we learn a bit of history from him			0
" in 1911 , @entity0 became the capital of @entity5 , " @entity152 says proudly			1
" more than 400,000 people pass through this train station every day			0
" upstairs from a small police station is a shelter where children can come to rest , eat and get medical attention			0
boys of all ages were hanging out that day , glued to a television set			0
" normally , kids do n't trust you , " @entity152 says			1
" it is quite difficult to convince them to come to a shelter			0
" dr. @entity248 sits behind a stark wooden table with a giant logbook in front of him			0
he says he treats kids for all sorts of ailments and regularly administers hiv tests			1
many children fall into a life of addiction			0
they sniff glue or burn foil and smoke gecko tails			0
next , we make our way to the @entity137 office in @entity85 , passing by a pottery market , where merchants , mostly women , are selling their terracotta wares			1
the tourists in my group are wide - eyed			2
they peer down alleys where you can only walk single file			2
they smile at people who pass us			0
photography is forbidden on many parts of the tour			2
nor do we stop to speak to any of the residents			0
we climb up several flights of stairs at the office			0
a wall of success stories greets the tourists			2
@entity288 works for designer @entity289			0
@entity290 works for the @entity0 metro			1
and there 's @entity152 , who eventually made his way to one of @entity137 's shelters and straightened out his life			1
he studied computers and dreams of becoming a software engineer			0
not surprising , i think , for a kid who grew up during @entity5 's information technology boom			0
@entity152 is 20 now and has not seen his family since that day that he decided to run			0
he can not even remember where he was from			0
" maybe up , " he says , referring to neighboring @entity306 state			0
he takes us into one of the classrooms			0
the younger children at @entity137 perform for the tourists			1
they sing their hearts out ; their smiles are wide			0
they seem so innocent , like children at my neighborhood day - care center in @entity318			2
but they have seen the worst of life			0
they can never grow up with the sweet naivety that makes childhood carefree			0
@entity325 , a student at the @entity326 , says the @entity148 is eye - opening			0
she came to @entity5 to see places such as the @entity329 , and although she encountered beggars on the street , she never would have walked through @entity85 by herself			1
she tells me she has not seen poverty like this before			2
through her travels in @entity5 , she felt helpless , not knowing whether or how to help			0
@entity337 student @entity336 says she feels inspired by the street kids			1
others in the group also tell me that this is an @entity5 they might not have otherwise seen			0
and maybe they were wiser for it , sensitized to problems that can be unimaginable back home			0
how can that be bad ? there 's no better way to learn about a place , after all , than to experience it			0
still , as the foreigners turn in their donations for @entity137 , i ca n't help but think about the day for what it was : a tour of poverty			1
and hasty , i think			0
in all of less than two hours , our look at others ' lives is over			0
the only people i have spoken to are connected to @entity137 and provide a very positive outlook on things			1
what might @entity85 residents have told us ? we all head back to where we first met @entity152 and scatter in our taxis and auto rickshaws			1
we escape the slums and return to comfort , leaving @entity152 and thousands of other baalaks on the streets			2
i think about @entity152 's parting words			0
he feels lucky most of the time , though sometimes , he ca n't shed the melancholy that blankets him			0
that 's something that visitors can not see on the tour			2
