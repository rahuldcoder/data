@entity0 -- you 've got to hand it to @entity4 -- he knows how to play the game			1
last week , citing potential cost overruns in the billions , the @entity7 governor stunned the political establishment by pulling the plug on the largest public transit project in the country			1
the sorely needed @entity14 ( access to the @entity16 ) tunnel would create a second train tunnel beneath the @entity18 , thus doubling passenger capacity from the most densely populated state into @entity21			1
in addition , the tunnel would create an estimated 6,000 construction - related jobs while also preparing the @entity26 region for sustained growth in the 21st century			1
it would cut road congestion , reduce emissions , increase productivity and ease the strain on the only working train tunnel from @entity7 into @entity26 , built more than a 100 years ago			2
this is the type of mass transit project that many in @entity37 , @entity38 and other places build routinely			1
it is also a vivid example of how we are falling behind in the world			0
( @entity45 note : i cringe when writing sentences like that			0
remember when @entity49 used to lead ? ) as president @entity52 noted monday , our infrastructure is woefully outdated and inefficient , and the longer we allow it to erode , the deeper our competitive edge erodes			0
the country needs this project and the economic ripple effect that comes with it more than @entity4 does			1
@entity4 knows it and so does the @entity52 administration , which is why transportation secretary @entity59 was in @entity7 meeting with the governor face - to - face 24 hours after @entity4 's announcement			1
during the meeting , @entity59 , an immensely respected and low - key , get - it - done type of politician , was looking for an opening to salvage the deal			0
during the meeting , according to reporters @entity68 and @entity69 , @entity4 signaled that he would be willing to look at options if the numbers worked			1
with that , @entity59 and @entity4 agreed to spend the next two weeks discussing proposed ways to save the project and , in @entity4 's view , limit risks to his state 's taxpayers , currently on the hook for a third of the $ 9 billion project , plus any cost overruns			1
( the tunnel was originally slated to cost roughly $ 5.7 billion , but that number has soared in recent years			2
) @entity4 , reminded of @entity86 's @entity85 , which ended up being four times the cost of original estimates , believes the final cost of the new tunnel will be much higher than federal officials and others suggest			1
and that 's the problem as @entity4 sees it			1
even though the @entity94 and the @entity95 and @entity7 have committed to pay $ 3 billion each , @entity7 , like most states , does not have the capacity to absorb possibly hundreds of millions of dollars in cost overruns			0
even though these overruns would occur when the economy has presumably rebounded , @entity7 is grappling with several other pressing budgetary needs			0
among them : -- a $ 46 billion unfunded pension liability for retired state employees			0
-- a decades - old court order to spend hundreds of millions in poor school districts			0
-- a nearly depleted @entity107 , which repairs and maintains the state 's roads , tunnels , and bridges and pays for the new ones			0
faced with these realities , @entity4 seems to be betting the @entity52 administration wo n't let the project die , and he may be right			1
indeed , if this is his goal , it 's a shrewd , calculating political move			0
he will need a clear , definable win to pull this off with hard numbers that save money for @entity7 taxpayers			0
in @entity129 circles , the former @entity49 attorney is currently a darling			0
@entity4 has spent the past month raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for fellow @entity129 in tight races			1
he 's visited more than a dozen states across the country , including @entity135			0
and as political columnist @entity137 often opines , no politician ever just goes to @entity135 , which has the first - in - the - nation presidential caucuses every four years			0
although he has publicly denied it , @entity4 clearly has his eyes on a higher plain			2
his recent mishandling of @entity7 's @entity144 application , in which the state narrowly lost a coveted $ 400 million federal grant for education investments , complicates that somewhat			0
still , this gamble with the @entity14 tunnel may increase his standing among @entity7 's electorate			2
if @entity4 is smart , he 'll work out a new deal with @entity59 , a fellow moderate @entity129			1
@entity59 is well - known for brokering deals with lawmakers who have opposing views			0
if @entity59 's record is any indication , next week he will present the governor with a reasonable plan that salvages the project and charts a responsible course forward			1
@entity4 should get what he can from @entity59 and chalk up the win for @entity7 taxpayers , who according to the nonpartisan @entity165 , get back 61 cents for every dollar they pay in federal taxes			1
no other state fares worse			0
@entity4 is playing hardball , no doubt about it			2
and while i may disagree with his approach , i 'm not one to begrudge him or any governor for trying to save money for his state 's taxpayers			2
the risk here is that @entity4 gets too greedy and sinks a worthy project with enormous benefits			1
the freshman governor is making a calculated gamble , and for the sake of thousands of unemployed construction workers , their families and others benefiting from the project , i hope he does n't overplay his hand			2
as @entity198 once told us , " every gambler knows that the secret to survivin ' is knowin ' what to throw away and knowin ' what to keep			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity202 .			2

@entity205 's largest public transit project *canceled* last week by gov. @entity4
project would create thousands of jobs and fill needed gap in transit *system* , says @entity202
he says @entity4 said he 's willing to consider *alternate* ways of financing tunnel
@entity202 says @entity4 is right to *protect* taxpayers but should work out a *compromise*
