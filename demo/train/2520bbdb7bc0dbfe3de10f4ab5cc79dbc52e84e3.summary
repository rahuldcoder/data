his voice , his posture and his threats are menacingly familiar			0
the black - clad @entity6 militant shown in a video demanding a $ 200 million ransom to spare the lives of two @entity11 citizens looks and sounds similar to the man who has appeared in at least five previous hostage videos			1
the knife - wielding masked man with a @entity17 accent , nicknamed " @entity18 , " has issued threats and overseen the beheadings of @entity22 and @entity23 captives			1
" you now have 72 hours to pressure your government in making a wise decision , by paying the $ 200 million to save the lives of your citizens , " the man in the video that appeared tuesday says in comments addressed to @entity11 citizens			0
" otherwise , this knife will become your nightmare			0
" @entity34 : harsh realities of kidnappings , ransom the amount of money is the same as that recently pledged by @entity11 prime minister @entity42 in humanitarian aid to @entity45 countries that are affected by @entity6 ' bloody campaign in @entity47 and @entity48			1
@entity11 believes the deadline arrives friday at 12:50 a.m. et. and chief cabinet minister @entity49 said wednesday the country will do its best to communicate with @entity6 through a third - party nation			1
but mystery and confusion still surround the identity of @entity18			1
@entity22 and @entity23 officials have said they believe they know who he is , but they have n't disclosed the information publicly			2
that could be because @entity63 intelligence agencies believe they have more to gain from keeping quiet , says @entity64 , a former @entity65 officer			1
" they can put pressure on his family , put pressure on his friends , " he told @entity2			0
" maybe they have a line to him			0
maybe they know who his cousins are who are going to @entity48 who can identify him			0
however , if you publicly tell everybody who he is , his real identity , then maybe he 'll go to ground and he 'll disappear			2
" there had been reports that @entity18 was injured in a bombing attack by the @entity22 - led @entity89 coalition			1
but the video that appeared tuesday would suggest , if it 's really the same person , that he 's alive and well enough to make a death threat accompanied by a demand for money			2
his apparent reappearance helps @entity6 ' slick propaganda machine , which is used by the extremist group to raise money and recruit followers			1
" it shows them resilient -- that they 're able to film this video with these @entity11 hostages outside in broad daylight somewhere presumably in @entity48 , " said @entity2 terrorism analyst @entity101			1
five months and roughly 2,000 airstrikes after @entity6 ' video of the killing of @entity22 journalist @entity113 , why does one of the @entity109 's most prominent tormentors appear to still be at liberty ? @entity22 and @entity23 military and intelligence officials declined to comment on the matter			1
experts say the problem lies in the extreme difficulty of infiltrating commandos into @entity48 to reach @entity18			2
" @entity6 operates in what we call denied territory , " said @entity122 , a retired @entity22 @entity123 colonel			2
" and that means by definition , that it 's very hard for our folks to get in there , it 's very hard for them to actually lay eyes on target			0
" a mission by @entity22 special operations forces in july failed to find @entity113 and other hostages in @entity48			0
" the attempt to rescue mr. @entity113 is one of the things that has now made the @entity143 very reluctant to act aggressively , " said @entity137 , a former @entity22 intelligence operative , who directed special operations in @entity47 and @entity139			0
a senior @entity22 administration official , however , said the @entity22 government is " actively pursuing justice " for the slayings of the hostages			0
" the @entity152 has an open criminal investigation , and as you have seen , we will hold terrorists like this accountable , no matter how long it takes , " the official said on condition of anonymity			0
" for operational security reasons , we are not in a position to detail all of the steps we are undertaking			0
" meanwhile , as @entity6 ' deadline draws nearer , the @entity11 government has to decide how it will respond to the extremists ' latest life - or - death ultimatum .			1

@entity63 officials have said they believe they know the identity of " @entity18 "
but they may be *withholding* it as a way to get closer to him , an @entity171 officer says
expert : the black - clad militant 's latest appearance shows @entity6 " resilient "
