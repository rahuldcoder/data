-- a federal judge with a secret court has refused the @entity5 administration 's request to extend storage of classified @entity8 telephone surveillance data beyond the current five - year limit			1
the @entity10 had argued several pending lawsuits over the bulk data collection program require it to preserve the records for a longer period of time			1
judge @entity16 , who presides over the @entity17 , concluded on friday the government had not overcome larger privacy concerns			1
" the amended procedures would further infringe on the privacy interests of @entity26 persons whose telephone records were acquired in vast numbers and retained by the government to aid in national security investigations , " said @entity16 , whose main duties are as a @entity22 - based federal district court judge			1
" the great majority of these individuals have never been the subject of investigations by the @entity35 to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities			0
the government seeks to retain these records , not for national security reasons , but because some of them may be relevant in civil litigation in which the destruction of those very same records is being requested			2
however , the civil plaintiffs potentially interested in preserving the ( telecom ) metadata have expressed no desire to acquire the records			0
" current surveillance court orders require the @entity8 or telecommunication companies that gathered the phone records to purge the material within five years			1
" the government makes no attempt to explain why it believes the records that are subject to destruction are relevant to the civil cases , " said @entity16 in his 12 - page order			2
there was no immediate reaction to the order from the @entity10			2
intelligence leaker @entity63 last june revealed a secret surveillance court order approving government collection of mass amounts of metadata from telecom giant @entity68			1
it includes phone numbers called and their location			0
the exact percentage of metadata being collected has not been revealed publicly			0
monitoring of actual conversations requires a separate warrant			0
president @entity5 in january cited privacy concerns when announcing that such data should no longer be held by the government , but instead be turned over to the domestic telecoms or a private third party			1
@entity8 would still have access to the calls to track potential terror connections			0
he ordered the intelligence community to formulate such a plan by march 28			0
the mission of the @entity89 court , named after the @entity89 that created it , is to decide whether to grant certain types of government requests -- wiretapping , data analysis , and other monitoring for " foreign intelligence purposes " of suspected terrorists and spies operating in the @entity26			1
the once - secret approval of collecting bits and pieces of information from electronic communications comes quarterly from judges at the court			2
to collect the information , the government has to demonstrate to a judge that it is " relevant " to an international terrorism investigation			0
there were 1,856 applications in 2012 to the @entity17 for electronic surveillance and physical searches for " foreign intelligence purposes , " the @entity10 said			2
the current case is in re : application of the @entity35 for an order requiring the @entity117 ( @entity118 14 - 01 ) .			0

judge with secret @entity89 court said the government has not overcome privacy concerns
current law requires the government to purge surveillance records within five years
the @entity10 argued that the data had to be preserved *due* to litigation
