@entity0 -- when you 're in love in @entity0 , you show it with a lock			1
a combination lock , a bicycle lock or , most commonly , a simple padlock -- hundreds of them -- all inscribed with the names of lovers and clinging to the chain link railing of the @entity13 , the @entity14 , the keys romantically tossed into the @entity16 flowing below			1
" without you , my life does n't make sense , " one of the locks reads in @entity19			2
" @entity22 and @entity23 engaged , " another announces to the world in @entity26			2
you might easily miss the modest pedestrian bridge with the shiny accessories in the tourist rush to find historic @entity30 or the ornate @entity31 , but i am taking it slow on my second visit to @entity0			1
there are no museums on my itinerary and no mad scrambles to fit in all of the city 's famous sites			2
i 've already seen the @entity40 , been to the top of the @entity42 , gazed down on @entity44 's tomb and admired @entity45			2
this visit is for savoring @entity0 : walking to wherever fancy strikes , sitting in any park or café that looks inviting and eating as many baguettes , pastries and other delectable things as my budget ( and figure ) will allow			1
" @entity56 " when i arrive , " @entity59 " is the talk of the town			2
it 's the first weekend of october , so the streets of @entity0 are extra crowded for the annual @entity62 -- @entity63 or @entity56 -- when museums stay open until dawn and organizers promise " surprising and unusual " art installations all over the city			1
one of them invites visitors to pick up a clear plastic umbrella and walk through a courtyard as rain machines and mauve lights make it look like they 've stepped into @entity78 's hit song			2
i start each of my few days in @entity0 with champagne			1
it 's right there , chilling in an ice bucket in the corner of my hotel 's breakfast buffet every morning , not far from a pitcher of milk			2
guests sip from their champagne flutes as casually as from their coffee cups as they fill up on cold cuts , cheeses and buttery croissants spread liberally with @entity93			2
an unexpected heat wave bathes @entity0 in summer light , so i take in the stunning views of the city from @entity98 and go explore hilly , bohemian @entity99			1
who knew grapes grow in @entity0 ? they bask in the sun on a slope on @entity105 in @entity99 , the city 's only vineyard			1
not far away , you can feast on sea bass in butter sauce in @entity111 , a restaurant topped by a little 18th - century windmill -- one of only two that remain in the area			0
a poster quest i take alarmingly frequent boulangerie and patisserie breaks			0
the bakery near my hotel , just off the @entity121 , has baskets of warm crunchy - soft baguettes and display cases full of elaborate sweets that you ca n't ignore			0
my favorite : a raspberry pistachio gateau , with the tart ruby fruit nestled in sweet clouds of pale green cream in between layers of flaky puff pastry			1
haunted by a poster of the @entity138 des @entity137 restaurant that i 've owned for years , i set out for @entity139 -- one of two islands in the @entity16 -- where the photo was taken			1
the restaurant now has a new name , @entity145 , but i 'm not disappointed			0
the peaceful little island , with its boutique - lined center street , is a charmer , and food temptations are all around : " lapin à la moutarde " ( rabbit with mustard sauce ) , " chocolat noir " ice cream , " rhubarbe " sorbet			1
close calls at @entity156 for entertainment , i watch the crazy traffic around the @entity159			1
there are no lanes and no traffic cops			1
cars entering the circle have the right of way , and they roar into the giant roundabout as the other cars already in it ( and going alarmingly fast ) squeal to a stop , sometimes with just inches to spare			0
there are honks and angry hand gestures as vehicles of every imaginable size -- from tiny smart cars to giant tour buses -- negotiate the circle with equal zeal			0
want to exit the roundabout into one of the 12 avenues fanning out of it ? just cut diagonally in front of all the other traffic			1
it 's both terrifying and fascinating to watch			0
when i ask the concierge at my hotel whether she drives around the arch , she smiles and shrugs her shoulders , " sure , you just do it			0
you just keep going ; otherwise the other cars will just " -- here she 's at a loss for words and mimes what looks like vehicles swerving wildly around her			0
her colleague at the front desk then confesses that when her husband goes around the arch , " i just close my eyes			0
" they tell me that when there is an accident at the @entity156 , the insurance companies of both drivers always split the bill 50/50			0
it 's just too difficult to ever determine who is at fault			0
" but there are no accidents , " one of the women insists			0
cheese heaven for a traffic - free experience , i head to @entity221 , a pedestrian market street not far from the @entity42 where @entity223 used to shop			1
you can sit down for a meal or assemble a moveable feast at the fruit , produce and specialty food shops that dot the area			1
the fromagerie itself is worthy of the trip : there are hundreds of varieties of cheeses for sale , their collective aroma wafting out into the street			0
you could make it your mission to try one cheese each day of the year and still not go through them all			0
for now , my time is running out			0
i watch one more time as the @entity42 sparkles like a champagne glass at night , with the hourly evening light show eliciting oohs , aahs and applause from the crowd on the @entity248			0
then i give in and buy a souvenir : a " @entity0 " t - shirt			1
i will wear it often .			0

this @entity0 visit focuses on lots of walking , sitting and eating instead of rushing
@entity256 has secret vineyard ; @entity139 is a charmer
watching the crazy traffic around the @entity159 can serve as *excellent* entertainment
assemble your own meal at the fruit , produce and specialty food shops on @entity221
