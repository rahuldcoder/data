secretary of state @entity0 said the @entity1 will help the @entity3 government in its battle against @entity6 - linked fighters in western @entity3 , but stressed it wo n't send troops			1
speaking to reporters in @entity10 on sunday during his visit to the @entity12 , @entity0 said the @entity1 is not contemplating a return to the volatile nation			1
@entity1 military forces , which invaded @entity3 and toppled the @entity17 regime in 2003 , fought insurgents there for years until they withdrew at the end of 2011			2
" we are not , obviously , contemplating returning			2
we 're not contemplating putting boots on the ground			1
this is their fight , but we 're going to help them in their fight , " @entity0 said , noting that the @entity1 plans to be in " close contact with all of the @entity3 political leaders " to determine how to help them			1
" we going to do everything that is possible to help them , and i will not go into the details except to say that we 're in contact with tribal leaders from @entity37 province whom we know who are showing great courage in standing up against this as they reject terrorist groups from their cities			1
and this is a fight that belongs to the @entity3			2
that is exactly what the president and the world decided some time ago when we left @entity3			0
" fighting in the predominantly @entity51 @entity37 province in recent days has posed a serious challenge to prime minister @entity53 and his @entity55 - dominated government , raising questions about his ability to hold the country together amid a rising insurgency			1
conflicting reports have the @entity61 ( @entity61 ) , formerly the group commonly known as @entity6 in @entity3 , in partial control of @entity64 , the site of some of the bloodiest fighting between @entity1 forces and insurgents during the @entity69			2
@entity51 populist ire in @entity37 this weekend , the government claimed , the @entity3 army shelled the @entity37 city of @entity64 in an effort to clear out @entity6 - linked fighters amid dueling claims by the terror group and government forces about just who was in control of the flashpoint town			1
but the conflict in @entity37 is not black and white -- @entity6 vs. pro-government troops -- according to local officials , political analysts and tribal leaders in @entity64 and @entity87			1
they say @entity53 is spinning the strife to his political advantage			0
these sources say @entity53 is trying to cite @entity6 as a pretext to crush @entity51 protesters and is using the same tack to get international support for his fight			0
they say he 's trying to create the false impression that @entity61 fighters control much of @entity64			0
@entity61 has been working doggedly to exploit a security vacuum across @entity3			0
while there are pockets of @entity6 - linked militants in @entity37 cities such as @entity64 , most regions in @entity37 , including @entity64 , are under the control of local police and @entity51 tribes not aligned with militants , they explained			1
@entity108 also has raged between these local tribes and the @entity3 army in @entity64			0
violence has flared in recent days because of the arrest of a @entity51 lawmaker in @entity87 and the dismantling of protest sites by the army in @entity64 and @entity87			2
most @entity51 in @entity37 have simply been angry at being regarded as second - class citizens in the majority @entity55 country			1
they have been upset with the local and central government authorities , and these grievances have spurred an ongoing uprising against the @entity55 - led government			0
things are a bit more stable in @entity87 , @entity37 's capital because the local government struck a deal with tribes to fight against @entity61			1
@entity53 is more supportive of local government in @entity87 than @entity64 , according to these sources			0
soldiers have not been stationed inside @entity37 cities for nearly a year			1
now , @entity53 is trying to bring the soldiers back , a move prompting @entity51 resistance			0
the deal the government made with some @entity51 tribal fighters was comparable to a 2007 @entity1 pact that saw @entity51 turn on @entity6 , siding with @entity1 and @entity3 forces to bring about an end to the terrorism			0
the fighting between @entity51 militants against @entity55 - dominated forces was reminiscent of fighting during the height of the @entity69 in 2006 and 2007 , when sectarian violence nearly tore the country apart			1
the analysts who spoke to @entity150 said that @entity55 have more to fear in the conflict with @entity51 because they risk losing its newfound and widespread power after decades of domination by a large @entity51 regime led by @entity17			0
the fight against the militants is " bigger just @entity3 ' as for @entity0 , he said the @entity1 government is concerned that @entity6 and @entity61 " are trying to assert their authority not just in @entity3 but in @entity163			1
" " these are the most dangerous players in that region			0
their barbarism against the civilians of @entity87 and @entity64 and against @entity3 security forces is on display for everybody in the world to see			0
their brutality is something we have seen before			0
and we will stand with the government of @entity3 and with others who will push back against their efforts to destabilize and to bring back , to wreak havoc on the region and on the democratic process that is taking hold in @entity3			0
" @entity0 called the fight against the militants " bigger than just @entity3 " and the @entity1 has an " interest " in helping an elected government " push back against the terrorists			1
" " the fighting in @entity163 is part of what is unleashing this instability in the rest of the region			2
that 's why everybody has a stake			0
all of the @entity196 , all of the regional actors -- @entity199 , the @entity1 , and a lot of players elsewhere in the world -- have a stake in pushing back against violent extremist terrorists who respect no law , who have no goal other than to take over power and disrupt lives by force			2
@entity210 raged in the capital of @entity212 on sunday			1
three car bombs and two roadside bombs exploded in several areas , killing at least 18 people and wounding dozens .			2

at least 18 dead in @entity212 violence
@entity0 says , " we 're not contemplating boots on the ground "
fighting in @entity37 province has *stirred* concern
