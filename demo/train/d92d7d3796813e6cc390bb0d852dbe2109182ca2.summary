-- @entity1 , the @entity2 winning singer and songwriter whose ballads helped so many of us through heartache , breakups and loss , was barely out of her teenage years when her first album was released back in 1988			1
now , she 's a 46 - year - old divorced mom of two girls touring the country to promote her seventh full - length solo album , called " @entity14			1
" " i 'm a whole hell of a lot older , " she joked , when i asked her , during a casual conversation at @entity0 's studios earlier this week , how much her life has changed			1
@entity1 credits her success in the ' 90s , fueled by memorable hits such as " @entity22 " and " @entity23 , " with allowing her to take time off , have children and be a full - time parent			1
her girls , now ages 7 and 12 , have traveled on tour with her since they were babies			1
" they 're the great leveler because they could n't care less what it is that i do for a living , " she said with a laugh			2
the three - time @entity2 winner and @entity37 - born singer did n't quite set out on her career to empower women , but that 's what she 's done			1
she spearheaded the @entity42 , a concert tour comprised of only female artists and female - led bands in the late 1990s and again in 2010 , which raised millions for charities			1
during our mom - to - mom chat , we talked about her biggest worries as a parent , what she admires about the singer @entity52 and why her sex life is thriving			1
the video above and this transcript of our conversation have been edited for length and clarity : @entity59 : what do you worry about most as a parent ? @entity1 : well , social media			1
i think @entity65 is a really dangerous tool in the hands of kids			0
i really do n't think they should be allowed on it until they 're 18 or 20 years old because it 's a weapon , basically			1
it 's also a great tool but if you 're not psychologically evolved enough and aware and empathetic to other people 's issues			1
that concerns me a lot , which is part and parcel why ( my daughters ) are on computers because they have them at school but i really limit the time they 're on them and i say , " @entity86			1
if you want to talk to your friends , bring them over to the house or go over to their houses and actually play			0
" i hear these kids hang out at each other 's houses and they just ... @entity59 : they 're all sitting on their phones ... @entity1 : i am the biggest jerk on the planet because ( my older daughter is ) one of the only kids that does n't have the @entity102 or whatever			1
i say , " you know what honey , when you are out there in the world and i do n't know where you are and we have to stay in contact then you can have one			0
right now , i 'm a car service			0
i drive you everywhere and i pick you up from wherever you go			0
" @entity59 : you have commented about performers such as @entity52 who posted unretouched photos of herself , basically saying here i am , flaws are ok			0
how important do you think that is for our girls ? @entity1 : i think it 's imperative because when i grew up , i do n't think i even knew " @entity121 " magazine or any of that stuff			1
i did n't have any issues with my body			2
i was n't overweight , i was n't skinny			0
i have a fast metabolism but i just eat and i wear the clothes i wear and i never really even gave it much of a thought			0
there 's just so much pressure on these girls these days			1
they 're looking at all the different teen stars who are wearing hardly anything			0
@entity59 : how important do you think female role models are ? @entity1 : i think they 're imperative			1
... someone like @entity138 speaking out for girls ' education , getting shot and then not dying but rising up and becoming an international superstar and an international heroine			2
those kinds of examples of strength , and strength of beliefs and just standing up for what you believe in and not backing down , i think are so imperative			0
@entity59 : where do you think we are when it comes to the state of women in our world , in our society ? @entity1 : there 's still a glass ceiling			1
i think we 've come a long way			0
there are way more women in powerful positions ( as ) @entity164			2
there 's still a huge discrepancy between how many women are in power in companies and how many men , and inequality in pay ... but we 're making strides , absolutely			1
but now there 's this whole thing of having it all			2
there 's no such thing as having it all			2
there 's no such thing as balancing it all			2
it 's a tricky , slippery slope			2
it 's a tightrope that we walk every day and some days we do it really well , and other days we fail miserably at it			2
@entity59 : so let 's talk about sex , shall we			1
( @entity1 revealed in a recent interview that she 's had more sex this year in her new relationship than she 's had in her life , so i had to ask her about that ! ) @entity1			1
@entity59 : i know we just met but you mentioned in an interview that that part of your life seems to be thriving in your relationship with former @entity203 player @entity202			0
@entity1 : i mean , yeah , there was a long dry spell of a number of years where i did n't date , did n't have a partner , so i was just on my own , with my girls , and yeah i met @entity202			1
@entity59 : many women in the latter half of their 40s are not necessarily enjoying that same kind of experience			2
@entity1 : no , and it was sort of like a resurgence for me , for sure , because i did n't have sex for years and then all of a sudden , you sort of think , everybody says , what is it , you do n't use it you lose it , right , and i thought , oh no , it came back , really quickly			1
) @entity59 : better than ever			0
@entity1 : better than ever			1
@entity59 : i have to stop because i am being obnoxious and embarrassing			0
you have experienced so many things -- obviously your divorce , you left your original management company , a new relationship , raising your children ... @entity1 : lost my dad			1
@entity59 : " @entity14 " is about all of that , right ? @entity1 : it 's about going through your 40s and all the changes			1
we do n't get to that point in our lives unscathed			0
we 're losing our family members			0
i lost my brother last november to bowel cancer so there are so many big changes that happen in our 40s , and it 's sort of that tipping point of i 'm in the second half of my life			2
to a certain degree i get to choose what this is going to look like			0
how do i want it to look ? and it 's sort of a reassessing of everything and i thought i 'm so lucky , i 'm so blessed			2
i have so many amazing things that have happened to me			0
i have my health , i have my kids ' health , i have great friends and family			0
i just want to suck the marrow out of every day that i have left because you just do n't know			0
you do n't know when your time is and i want every day to count			2
@entity59 : absolutely and also important to you , the @entity268 for at risk and underserved kids in your community			0
how important is it to give back ? @entity1 : to give of yourself , it 's like a drug			1
and when i did @entity42 , i made a lot of money and i thought , what am i going to do ? i do n't live a crazy lifestyle			0
i have all this extra money			0
i want to do something important with it			0
... we gave over $ 7 million to charity through @entity42 over the three years and so i started the music school because i looked around in @entity285 and thought what do we need ? what do kids need ? what did i need ? i needed music and there are a lot of kids that do n't have music in schools anymore			2
i guess it 's the first thing that gets cut from funding			2
and so we started a small project			0
it was about 200 kids and now we have over 700 this year			0
we 're going to have over 1,000 kids in the program starting next year 13 years in			0
@entity59 : a tour , a new album , how do you top this , @entity1 ? and what is next ? @entity1 : i have no idea			1
like my kids , i live in the moment			0
i ca n't help it			0
i have a very hard time looking forward , and thinking about what 's coming next			1
i 'm just enjoying every moment			0
