the foundations of @entity3 began to shake			0
a shadow cast itself across the city as the sun dipped beneath the stands			0
amidst the rising tension a diminutive figure rose			0
he bent down , tied his laces and strode forward			0
cometh the hour , cometh the man			0
those sat around the amphitheater rose in celebration , the enemy shrunk back into their skins , the victory was already assured			0
as @entity22 placed his feet onto the @entity4 turf you could see a visible chill go down the spine of each and every @entity29 player			1
leading 1 - 0 and with a place in the semifinals of the @entity32 within touching distance , @entity29 looked set to produce one of the most remarkable results of the competition			1
a 2 - 2 draw in last week 's first leg appeared to have given @entity39 the edge in a tie which the @entity43 club was expected to breeze through			1
but when @entity45 shook the very foundations of one of @entity49 's greatest bastions , a cloud began to descend upon manager @entity50 and his ailing players			2
@entity39 might be 13 points clear at the top of @entity54 , but this was not a performance which engendered confidence			1
suddenly there was doubt , anxiety , even fear			0
and then in a matter of minutes , everything had changed			0
just nine minutes after @entity22 's introduction , @entity39 was level as the @entity68 resistance wilted under the wizardry of the game 's most talented attacking force			1
the four - time @entity72 has scored 57 times this season , but just his mere presence was enough to unnerve his opponents			2
a 1 - 1 draw was enough to take @entity39 through on away goals after the two teams finished level at 3 - 3 on aggregate			1
but it could have been so different had the @entity68 side taken the chances afforded to them during a frantic opening 45 minutes			0
@entity86 wasted the most clear - cut opportunity , racing onto @entity88 's through ball only to fire straight at the onrushing @entity90			1
@entity91 forced @entity90 into a sharp save when he headed @entity88 's cross towards goal as the visiting side began to turn the screw			2
the @entity68 league leaders continued to look threatening and it came as no surprise when it finally grabbed the initiative five minutes after the break			0
once again it was enigmatic @entity88 who created the opportunity , threading the ball through to @entity45			0
the @entity105 playmaker took the ball in his stride before lashing home a left - footed effort which left @entity90 with no chance			2
but no sooner had the ball hit the net than a certain somebody was already preparing to make a grand entrance			0
as @entity22 began to warm - up on the sideline , the crowd responded			2
suddenly , the fear and anxiety which had gripped those adorned in the blue and red of @entity39 began to dissipate			1
his entrance onto the pitch with 28 minutes remaining seemed to breathe new life into a @entity39 side which had failed to produce anything of note in front of goal			1
but with @entity22 , albeit not a 100 % @entity22 on the field , the home side began to tick and within nine minutes of his introduction it was level			2
inevitably it was the @entity105 who made the difference , jinking his way past two white shirts before rolling the ball in for @entity143 , who laid it off for @entity145 to rifle home			2
that goal sealed @entity39 's place in the semifinals for the sixth consecutive year and defender @entity150 believes his side ran out worthy winners			1
" i think @entity39 has shown a lot of quality in the six years and i think we deserve it again to be in the semifinals , " @entity150 told @entity153			1
" @entity29 is very strong with good quality but i think we deserved it			1
" in the first leg we deserved a little more and tonight we 're very happy to have qualified			0
" it does n't matter if he 's a little bit injured he can change everything			2
" we are very proud and lucky to have him in our side			0
he 's our reference as a striker - he can score , he can pass he can do anything and everything			1
" @entity29 coach @entity171 added : " i thought we played well			1
we caused @entity39 problems , but @entity22 is a fantastic player and can find a solution for his team even when not fully fit			2
" in the night 's other game , @entity175 produced a hugely impressive performance to book its place in the last four courtesy of a 2 - 0 win over @entity181			1
leading 2 - 0 from the first leg , @entity175 eased past the @entity184 side thanks to goals from @entity186 and @entity187			1
@entity175 , which lost in the final to @entity189 in @entity190 last year , joins @entity193 rival @entity191 in the semifinals			1
it is the first time two @entity196 clubs have made the last four of the competition in the same season			0
and winger @entity200 , who was denied a goal of his own by the woodwork , is keen to avoid @entity204 's side in the next round			0
" if you win away 2 - 0 in @entity206 here i think that 's an amazing result because they are unbeaten for i do n't know how many games and they are so strong at the back , " @entity200 told @entity153			1
" even more , if you dominate the game in the second half as we did , it is a great performance			0
" we would like to be kept apart from @entity191 in the semifinals but we do n't have a choice and it comes out how it comes			0
" it going to be a big one and the semifinals have maybe the four best teams at the moment			2
" @entity175 will now compete in their third semifinal in four years , but it must do without @entity186 in the first leg with the @entity228 star set to serve a one - game ban			1
@entity181 goalkeeper @entity230 believes @entity175 's extra experience was a key factor in the outcome of the tie			1
he told @entity153 : " the big difference between them and us is experience			0
i was even more impressed tonight than in @entity190			0
" in the first leg we did not give our all , but tonight we did and still there was nothing we could do			0
i think @entity175 can win the @entity32			2

@entity39 claims 1 - 1 draw against @entity29 to qualify for semifinals
