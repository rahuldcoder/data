-- negotiations between @entity3 owners and the players union on a new collective bargaining agreement were given a 24 - hour extension thursday , according to a statement from the league			1
" the @entity3 and @entity9 have agreed to extend the expiration of the ( collective bargaining agreement ) for 24 hours and continue negotiating under the direction " of federal mediator @entity13 , the statement said			1
" the agreement by both sides to refrain from comment on the negotiations remains in place			1
" representatives of the players and owners have been meeting in @entity22			1
" i just want to say to all of our fans who dig our game , we appreciate your patience while we work through this , " said @entity9 executive director @entity23			0
" we 're going to keep working			0
we want to play football			0
" without a last - minute agreement or the extension of the deadline , the @entity9 had been expected to decertify on thursday afternoon -- meaning it would stop being the collective bargaining agent for the players			1
by decertifying , the union would clear the way for the players to file an antitrust lawsuit if the owners lock out the players as soon as friday , after the current contract expires			1
all of that would mean the first @entity3 work stoppage since 1987 and the likelihood of months of labor and legal maneuvering for football fans already confused about how a $ 9 billion industry lacks enough money to satisfy everyone			2
even if there is a lockout , the @entity3 draft would proceed as scheduled on april 28 - 30 , the league says			1
all other regular off - season activity would cease , threatening to delay or cancel the start of the 2011 season now scheduled for september 8			0
asked about the talks , president @entity56 said thursday that the parties ought to be able to figure out how to split the revenue and keep fans happy			0
" you 've got owners , most of whom are worth close to a billion dollars , you 've got players who are making millions of dollars , " he said during a joint news conference with visiting @entity63 president @entity62			2
" my working assumption , at a time when people are having to cut back , compromise and worry about making the mortgage and paying for their kids ' college education is that the two parties should be able to work it out without the president of the @entity80 intervening			0
" currently , the owners take about $ 1 billion off the top of league revenue , and the players get 60 percent of the rest			2
for a new contract , the owners want to double their take off the top to $ 2 billion , with the players continuing to get 60 percent of the rest			2
the @entity3 generated $ 9.3 billion in revenue in 2010			2
other issues include a proposal by the owners to increase the regular season schedule to 18 games from the current 16			0
the overall number of games per season , including exhibition games , would remain at the current 20			0
the players ' union questions why the owners should get additional money up front and challenges the league 's 32 teams to fully open their financial records			0
the owners , who say they are not legally obligated to provide full financial disclosure , argue they are looking out for the long - term stability of the franchises and the league			0
if there is a lockout , players wo n't get their salaries or bonuses , and if the shutdown forces the league to cancel games next season , the @entity3 estimates a loss of $ 400 million in revenue each week			1
another possible scenario from the talks would have @entity13 declare an impasse that would automatically extend the rules of the expiring collective bargaining agreement			1
such an impasse can only occur if neither side takes steps to halt the negotiations , such as the union decertifying or the owners declaring a lockout .			1

negotiations extension averts lockout , for now
@entity3 owners and players are negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement
a federal mediator is *overseeing* the talks
without an agreement , a lockout and *litigation* are likely
