@entity0 -- the world 's two biggest economies are facing off over tensions that could ignite a trade war and lead to a catastrophic split between the @entity7 and @entity8 , says analyst @entity9			1
president @entity10 says an undervalued currency is giving @entity8 companies an unfair advantage in selling products , and this week the @entity15 passed a bill that would let the @entity7 put tariffs on goods from @entity8			1
@entity8 has retaliated against earlier trade sanctions by the @entity7 and strongly opposes the bill passed by the @entity15			1
" one has to hope a lot of it is bluff because the consequences of a significant trade war between @entity8 and the @entity7 would be very dramatic , " @entity9 said			1
" we need the @entity8 to still have enormous faith in the @entity7 economy , not just to buy @entity30 bills , but to maintain all the links they have with the @entity7 economy			1
" @entity9 conducted a rare interview with @entity8 's prime minister , @entity35 , his first with a @entity37 journalist since a similar interview by @entity9 two years ago			1
the interview is being shown this weekend on @entity9 's sunday show , " @entity41			1
" the author and host spoke to @entity1 thursday			0
here is an edited transcript : @entity1 : what are the chances that we 'll see political reform in @entity8 ? @entity9 : the @entity8 clearly feel that they need to open up but they do n't quite know how and they do n't know how to do it without letting go of their monopoly on power			1
they 're very sure - footed now on economic power and economic reform , they really feel they have complete mastery over that area , but on political reform , they 're very tentative			0
@entity35 has been clearly somebody who 's talked a lot about political reform for a long time			2
my own sense is that he is clearly of the mind to keep things moving in this direction but obviously there are other people who feel otherwise			0
it is n't clear to me that the forces of political reform are in the ascendancy in @entity8			2
... @entity1 : what sense do you have of the current state of @entity8 's economic relationship with the @entity7 ? @entity9 : clearly the @entity7 is pushing very hard on the issue of the @entity8 currency and i think that a lot of it has to do with the realities of a bad economy here , coupled with a kind of sense that there are very few other levers that the @entity7 has			1
so you 're seeing a lot of rhetoric focused around @entity8 currency and the fact that the @entity15 just passed this week a measure that would punish the @entity8 for having artificially undervalued their currency			1
the @entity8 central bank has actually driven its currency even lower as a kind of response to all this			2
now the @entity10 administration has managed to maintain a pretty good overall relationship , and i think that the @entity8 understand that some of this is pre-election politics , but i do n't think its fundamentally good because these are the two biggest economies in the world and they should be trying to find a way to avoid getting into what appears to be the beginnings of a trade war			1
remember the vast numbers of companies that are exporting from @entity8 that are @entity7 companies			1
the @entity8 have opened up their economy to a huge number of @entity7 firms			1
... now this is all interdependence , no one is doing anyone a favor here			0
@entity1 : what 's the impact of an undervalued @entity8 currency ? @entity9 : the @entity8 benefit			1
we benefit enormously from having cheap @entity8 goods			1
the big charge against the @entity8 that is being made by @entity129 and even being made by the administration is that they are keeping their currency artificially low , and that favors @entity8 manufacturers , that they have an unfair advantage to sell their goods more cheaply			2
ok , that 's basically true			0
but one has to keep in mind two things			0
one is that a large number of those so - called @entity8 manufacturers are actually @entity7 companies manufacturing out of @entity8			1
the second thing is that these @entity8 goods that are now cheaper are bought by @entity7 and @entity7 benefit enormously from cheaper goods			1
the reason there is almost no inflation in @entity7 is largely due to cheap @entity8 manufacturing			1
the reason that the @entity150 has been able to maintain interest rates so low without any fear of inflation is that they have @entity8 acting as a deflationary machine pushing down the price of manufactured goods , which has allowed the @entity150 to rescue the @entity7 economy by keeping rates so low even now			1
@entity7 get cheap mortgages for that reason , get cheap credit , get cheap interest rates for their credit cards			2
so it 's not as if @entity7 do n't benefit from the @entity8 having the currency cheap			1
in fact there are many economists who think we should send the @entity8 a thank - you note for keeping the prices of our goods so low			2
... i 'm not sure i 'd go so far but i 'd say there are many , many benefits the @entity7 derive from having cheap @entity8 goods			1
@entity1 : do you think this is a relationship that can continue to exist or is it an imbalance that has to change at some point ? @entity9 : there 's a structural problem , which is that the @entity7 is the established superpower in the world , @entity8 is the rising power			1
those kinds of relationships have often ended up badly			0
think about @entity190 as it rose in the 1930s , think about @entity193 as it rose in the 1890s and 1920s , think about the @entity196			0
but it does n't always have to be that way , and today the world is so interdependent that it would be a catastrophe if the @entity7 and @entity8 were to have a serious schism			1
there are going to be these points of tension constantly , and the question is can we navigate those periods of tension and get over them ... for the last 10 or 15 years we have			0
the big shift that 's taken place is that the @entity8 are much more confident and much more powerful than they 've ever been			2
@entity1 : how is that greater power being used ? @entity9 : look at what happened with the @entity190			2
the @entity190 had picked up a @entity8 captain of a trawler who had wandered into what the @entity190 regard as @entity190 waters			2
they picked him up and arrested him			0
the @entity8 demanded that they release him ; the @entity190 said no. but eventually the @entity190 bowed to @entity8 demands			2
why ? because they sensed that the balance of power had shifted			0
it was only a few weeks earlier that the news came out that @entity8 had overtaken @entity190 as the second largest economy in the world			2
if you look at the way the @entity8 stimulus has been so successful at restimulating the @entity8 economy , which is now growing at 9 percent again , and you compare it to the fate of @entity37 economies , you can understand why the @entity8 are more confident , assertive and sure of themselves			0
@entity1 : so if the relationship with @entity8 is helping the @entity7 in the short term , is it causing long - term damage to the @entity7 manufacturing base and the overall economy ? @entity9 : i think that suggests that you have an alternative to being engaged with @entity8			1
it 's an open world economy			0
it 's not just @entity8 that is manufacturing stuff , it 's @entity244 , it 's @entity245 , it 's @entity246 , it 's @entity247 , it 's all over the world			2
the way i would put it is that @entity8 represents a challenge to the @entity7			1
the best way to solve that challenge is for us to get our act together			0
the real threat @entity8 poses is not a cheap currency			2
it 's a competitive economy that is producing things at every level cheaper than we are , and the question is what should we be doing to be a competitive economy			0
while we do many things very well ... we have lost too much manufacturing capacity in @entity7			0
look at @entity193 , a case of a very high wage economy that still has maintained a manufacturing capacity , but they did n't do that by isolating themselves from the world economy			0
to the contrary , @entity193 is a huge trading nation			0
they 've gotten their act together , they 've gotten their workers better training , they 've gotten their manufacturing to be more high end and more complex , so what they make is more in the @entity284 model , highly skilled , complex engineering , putting out premium products and commanding premium prices , which allows you to have a high wage structure			0
we 've done that in some areas ... but by and large we 've let manufacturing erode			0
but that 's not @entity8 's fault , that 's our fault			1
@entity1 : is the @entity10 administration taking the right approach in dealing with @entity8 ? @entity9 : i think the @entity10 people have been very serious about the @entity8 relationship			1
they approached it from the start as a major strategic partnership			0
i think you ca n't really fault the @entity10 administration for some of the friction , some of it is congressional short - term re-election stuff			0
some of it frankly is that the @entity8 have been somewhat unpredictable in their responses			0
they dis - invited [ defense ] secretary @entity312 from visiting @entity8 , which seemed a bad idea , because the one thing you do want to maintain is constant contact and collaboration between these two countries			0
the @entity8 military clearly wanted to send some kind of a signal and withdrew an invitation , which has now been re-extended ... the @entity8 are engaging in somewhat unpredictable behavior , which is unfortunate , but i think it reflects their growing pains as a great power			0
@entity1 : what 's driving that unpredictable behavior ? @entity9 : they 're becoming more assertive , they 're getting more arrogant , which is natural given their success and their size , but i do n't think they 're becoming more threatening			2
i think the problem is that they have n't figured out what their national interests are , what kind of a great power do they want to be in the world			0
what are their broader interests with regard to nuclear nonproliferation , with regard to the @entity346 ? i do n't think they 've thought that through			0
twenty years ago , they were a struggling @entity350 nation that never thought about any of that stuff ; now they have to have a foreign policy for everything .			0
