how hard is it to create a website to help people get health insurance under the @entity4 ? for three 20 - year - old programmers in @entity7 , it took about three days ' worth of work			1
spurred by the problems that have surrounded the rollout of the official @entity14 site , the trio created an alternative , @entity16 , quickly and cheaply			1
at first glance , it looks like a triumph of tech - startup nimbleness over government inefficiency			0
@entity22 , who created the site along with @entity24 and @entity25 , said all three of them had tried using the government website to get insurance			0
" we were surprised to see that it was actually fairly difficult to use @entity32 to find and understand our options , " he told @entity29			2
" given that the data was publicly available , we thought that it made a lot of sense to take the data that was on there and just make it easy to search through and view available plans			0
" the result is a bare - bones site that lets users enter their zip code , plus details about their family and income , to find suggested plans in their area			1
" the @entity16 is a free guide that makes it easier to find and sign up for health insurance under the @entity4			1
we only use carefully vetted , publicly available data , " the site reads			0
" the @entity16 is not affiliated with any lobby , trade group or government agency and has no political agenda			2
" tech experts enlisted to help fix @entity4 website the sherpa are an ethnic group in @entity63 , some of whom have long served as guides for people climbing @entity68 and other mountains in the @entity70			0
the name has come to be used generically for any kind of guide or mentor			0
of course , it 's not fair to compare the creation of @entity16 to the rollout of the more complicated government aca site , which everyone from president @entity80 on down has acknowledged as a horribly botched affair			1
for one , you ca n't actually use @entity84 to sign up for coverage			2
the site states that it 's for research purposes only , and that users must verify the premiums and subsidies they find there with state health care exchanges , insurance companies or on @entity32 itself			1
" it is n't a fair apples - to - apples comparison , " @entity22 said			0
" unlike @entity32 , our site does n't connect to the @entity99 , @entity100 , and various state exchanges and authorities			1
furthermore , we 're using the government 's data , so our site is only possible because of the hard work that the @entity32 team has done			1
" but it does cast light on the difference between what can be done by a small group of experts , steeped in @entity114 's anything - is - possible mentality , and a massive government project in which politics and bureaucracy seem to have helped create an unwieldy mess			2
@entity121 government website lists bakery , mechanic for @entity4 help creating the original sherpa site took three days and cost " several hundred dollars , " according to @entity22			1
the three programmers have continued fine - tuning the site as its popularity has grown			1
in less than a week , the site has had almost 200,000 unique visitors and over half a million page views , he said			0
" we 've heard from people of all ages and walks of life , and thousands of people have reached out to us directly via email , phone , and @entity142 to thank us to and to suggest features and request improvements , " he said			0
" tens of thousands of people have clicked through to buy a specific plan , suggesting that we are achieving our goal : helping people find a health insurance plan			2
" maybe the @entity80 administration can learn from the @entity153 example			0
as it scrambles to fix the heath care site , the government has sought to inject a little more @entity114 into the process by enlisting a " @entity157 " of staffers from @entity159 and @entity160 , as well as @entity161 , a site reliability engineer on leave from @entity164 .			0
