he 's the war - ending president who , as of tuesday , has ordered airstrikes in seven different countries ( that we know of )			1
president @entity5 has always acknowledged there are times when military force is necessary			1
even when he accepted his @entity9 in 2009 , he said there could be instances when war is " morally justified			0
" but though he campaigned for the presidency on ending @entity15 - led wars , @entity5 's administration has certainly been willing to use force when it sees fit			1
here are seven places where the @entity5 administration is known to have ordered airstrikes : @entity20 @entity15 's longest war became @entity5 's responsibility when he took office in 2009 , and like his predecessor he has ordered airstrikes against suspected militant targets in the country			1
the air campaign -- which has utilized both manned aircraft and unmanned drones -- has been a major sticking point between the @entity15 and the local government , which has decried the high civilian death toll			0
in may @entity5 announced a plan to withdraw most @entity15 forces from @entity20 by the end of this year , leaving behind a force of about 10,000 to maintain security and train @entity20 forces			1
with a new @entity20 president finally confirmed , @entity15 officials expect the long - awaited @entity42 to be signed soon , permitting the residual @entity15 force			2
@entity44 like in @entity20 , militants have been targeted by @entity15 drones flying over @entity44 , causing similar uproar when they strike civilians rather than suspected @entity51 outposts			0
@entity5 acknowledged that concern during a major speech at the @entity54 in 2013 , saying that @entity15 strikes that kill civilians could have the effect of spurring radicalization			1
@entity59 in march 2011 , @entity5 announced the @entity15 would join allied nations to launch air strikes on @entity59			2
the move came after a @entity65 resolution authorizing use of force to protect @entity59 civilians , and though regime change was n't @entity5 's stated goal at the beginning of the campaign , the airstrikes ended with the death of longtime @entity59 leader @entity74			1
since then the security situation in @entity59 has deteriorated			0
in 2012 , four @entity15 were killed during an attack on the @entity15 compound in @entity78 , and in july of this year , the @entity79 in @entity80 was evacuated			0
@entity81 facing threats from @entity84 , the @entity5 administration significantly ramped - up the use of armed drones			2
nearly 100 attacks have occurred since 2009 , according to estimates from the @entity89 , resulting in the deaths of hundreds of militants , but also many civilians			0
@entity84 in @entity81 has been a nexus of threats against the @entity15 , including the so called " underwear bomber " who tried to ignite explosives on a @entity15 - bound airliner in 2009			0
@entity99 @entity15 drones have targeted militants associated with @entity102 , a terrorist network that perpetrated a high - profile attack last year at a mall in @entity106			0
earlier this month , the @entity15 targeted the group 's leader @entity107 using commandos aided by drones , killing him in an area south of @entity112			0
@entity113 citing a humanitarian crisis and potential threats to @entity15 interests , @entity5 ordered airstrikes to begin in @entity113 in august , becoming the fourth president in a row to order airstrikes there			1
the @entity113 government , outmatched by @entity123 fighters taking over broad swaths of land , welcomed the strikes			2
the campaign broadened in september , when @entity5 announced he would begin targeting @entity123 specifically			2
instead of seeking specific authorization from lawmakers , @entity5 said he would rely on a @entity131 authorization from 2011 that allowed the president to go after @entity84			1
@entity133 @entity5 's latest front for airstrikes has been gripped by civil war for more than three years			1
@entity5 came to the brink of ordering airstrikes there in 2013 , after @entity133 president @entity140 used chemical weapons on civilians			1
but after @entity131 balked , @entity5 backed away , brokering instead a deal to rid @entity140 of his chemical stockpiles			2
how @entity5 came to launch strikes in @entity133 a year later , facing a different threat in @entity133 in the form of @entity123 and the @entity84 offshoot @entity149 , @entity5 authorized airstrikes on terrorist targets alongside a coalition of other @entity154 states			1
officials say the mission to defeat those groups wo n't be won in day			0
instead they 're predicting a sustained effort that will surely be left for the next commander in chief to carry forward			0
opinion : @entity15 's wartime president			0
