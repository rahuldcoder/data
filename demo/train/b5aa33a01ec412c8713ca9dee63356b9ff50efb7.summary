-- " who 's the treasurer ? " @entity2 and @entity3 and @entity4 were at a motorcycle shop in @entity6 , @entity7 , ordering a part for @entity3 's bike when they met two old bikers from @entity11 and talked with them about their trip across the country			1
although they had no treasurer , @entity14 pointed to @entity4 to answer the question			2
" you guys are going to need this , trust me , " said one of the older men , handing him $ 200 in cash			1
the three friends , all in their early 20s , admit they looked a little raggedy at the time			2
" it was straight kindness , " said @entity4 , and typical of the generosity of the bikers they met across the country			2
and it turns out , " we did need it the next day for more bike repairs			2
" the generosity of strangers repeated itself during the two - month summer journey of three young men on the cusp of adulthood to find and document @entity43 culture and people across the @entity45			1
and making the trip on motorcycles connected them not just to the towns and people they visited , but also to the country 's biker community			1
an exploration of biker culture contributing their own money and raising funds from family , friends and @entity60 , the trio started a blog , raised over $ 10,000 to fund the trip and pay for the pre- and post-production costs of documenting their journey			1
they documented the journey on their blog and the reddit online community , and they hope to have a documentary and book out sometime next year			2
traveling on motorcycles turned out to be key			2
@entity3 rode a 1982 @entity75 ( $ 500 cost ) ; @entity14 rode a 1980 @entity77 ( $ 500 ) ; and @entity4 rode a 1985 @entity78 ( $ 1500 cost )			2
" on @entity83 , on @entity78 , on seca " was a mantra they picked up for the trip			1
" we did n't know motorcycles were going to be that much of a connection between people , but they were , " said @entity4			1
" every time you get to a new place , you 're part of this new community			2
" " with motorcycles you feel the scenery and the microclimate change and smell the fields you drive through , " said @entity14			2
" besides , it 's just plain badass			2
" finding their first @entity43 they packed up their bikes and left around noon on july 6			2
they planned to head north , turn east to get to @entity102 , south to @entity103 and then through @entity11 and the @entity104 to return home to @entity106 , but they decided not to keep to a strict schedule , allowing for fellow travelers to guide them on their way			1
it did n't take long to hit pay dirt			1
a few hours after they hit the road , they found their first @entity43 in @entity117 , a small town north of @entity118			0
as they hopped off their bikes , the locals they met convinced them to come back the next day for a parade marking @entity122			0
" the whole community came out and let us be a part of it and accepted us into the community , " @entity3 said			0
that serendipity set the tone for the rest of the trip			1
the best sandwich in @entity133 , or anywhere the travelers only had a guarantee of places to stay ( and eat ) in @entity102 and @entity138			1
everything else would be an exploration , local recommendations and possibly , information from their not - guaranteed @entity144 connections			0
the road led them to a @entity148 deli in @entity149 , @entity133 , that " made the best sandwiches we 've ever tasted , " said @entity4			0
they bought sandwiches and drove a mile down the road into @entity7 near a bridge to picnic and more			0
" we jumped off the bridge to swim , " @entity3 said			0
and the drive through the @entity161 mountain range that cuts @entity133 and @entity7 was n't too shabby either			1
they also explored the source of their food , working for five days at @entity166 in @entity167 in exchange for room and board			0
" it was some of the most gorgeous , breathtaking @entity45 looking farmland i 've ever seen , with rolling green hills and grain mills , " @entity14 said			0
" it felt like what we were looking for the whole time -- true @entity180 heartland			1
" the farm 's kindness was typical of the people who gave them shelter on their journey			0
" we pulled up , three dirty bikers , to this nice sustainable farm , " he said			0
they " showed us a nice place to park the bikes , took us on a tractor up around the whole property and told us about everything they were doing			1
" a willingness of strangers to share their stories was also typical			0
shortly after they crossed the @entity202 into @entity203 and found a good campsite at @entity205 , they heard music coming through the woods			1
" was it a violin or cello ? " said @entity4 , so they went to explore it			0
they discovered two older @entity215 men playing songs about @entity217 on their saxophones			1
" we found the coolest guys on the whole trip , " said @entity4			1
busted shocks and other struggles the trip was n't without its troubles			1
@entity3 's shocks stopped working somewhere in @entity7			0
" for a few days i did n't know if my bike would be able to make it , " he said			1
but they were able to fix it			0
" we pulled it all apart in the forest , drained it and put in new fluid			0
" @entity14 also had the smallest gas tank , holding a gallon less than the other two bikes			0
he also had the worst gas mileage			0
and so he ran out of gas at least five times on the trip , and coasted into gas stations on fumes at least three times			1
" i learned toward the end of the trip to carry a water bottle or two of gas			1
" by the time they arrived home in @entity118 on august 28 , everyone was glad to sleep in their own beds again			0
" for the first six days back , @entity4 was at his girlfriend 's house , and @entity3 and i sat on the couch watching movies , " said @entity14			0
' an adult within my society ' giving up the benefits of home for a couple months was worth the journey			0
@entity3 left @entity118 thinking it would be a way to transition from his youth to adulthood			0
along the way , he hoped to learn " what it means to be a man in my society			0
" while he does n't have any specific answers , " seeing my country and understanding what my country is about ... helped me understand that more			1
" while @entity14 has always liked to travel and experience new things , he thought he would graduate college , get a job and save for his next planned trip			1
" being out there in @entity180 on the road , and roughing it , inspired me to book a plane ticket to @entity180 with my last $ 400 , " he said			1
" i thought , ' if you did this , you can do pretty much anything without a lot of resources			0
' " @entity4 , who had graduated in may not knowing what he wanted to do , thinks travel and video may be his calling			0
( and he learned how to ride a motorcycle along the way			1
) the three friends credit each other with making it an amazing experience			0
" we did get in fights and have problems , but we would n't have been able to do it without each other , " said @entity3			1
" every different leg of the trip , there was one pushing , one dragging and one on a stretcher , " he said			2
" it would change every single day			0
" " we would n't have made it across the country and back without the others			2

three young men set out to discover @entity180 from their motorcycle seats
the best meal of the trip was n't in @entity320 , @entity102 or @entity138
a national park in @entity203 delivered a *surprising* musical *interlude*
