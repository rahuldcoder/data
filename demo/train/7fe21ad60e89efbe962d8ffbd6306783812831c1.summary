-- " all around me my friends were lying injured and dead			0
" these are not the confessions of a battle - hardened soldier who signed up to fight in his nation 's war			1
they are the words of a 15 - year - old boy lying in a hospital bed in @entity10 , @entity11 , after @entity13 militants attacked his school in an act of savagery so bloody and brazen it seized the attention of a world grown nearly indifferent to the barbarism vying regularly for its attention			1
at a time of playground bombings in @entity28 , kidnapped schoolgirls in @entity30 , girls ' schools shuttered under threat in @entity32 and conflicts descending into chaos in real time , the attack on the @entity11 's @entity23 brought home once again the danger children face simply for the act of heading to school			1
are we ready to watch schools become the new front lines ? it is a question we all must answer			1
the @entity10 attack was not a one - off			1
it was simply larger and even more horrific than previous carnage			0
" in 2013 , 78 attacks against schools , teachers and schoolchildren were reported to the @entity52 in @entity11 , " a news release from the @entity52 's special representative for children and armed conflict noted			1
this morning , condemnations poured in , including one from a global leader who knows firsthand such deadly violence			0
" i condemn these atrocious and cowardly acts , " @entity61 winner @entity60 said in a statement			0
two years ago , the @entity13 shot the @entity11 teenager at close range on her school bus in retaliation for her eloquent advocacy for girls ' education in @entity71 in the province of @entity73 ; its capital is @entity10 , site of tuesday 's attack			1
nor is the violence new			0
armed conflict increasingly has made the world 's children its front lines			1
in a wrenching interview , a girl named @entity83 tells of being abducted from her girls ' school in northern @entity86 in 2004 at 14 by soldiers for @entity88			0
she was forced to become his sex slave and to bear his children , one of countless children forced into soldiering and slavery by @entity88 's @entity96			1
as schools become battlefields , the need to protect them has never been greater			2
indeed , education is one of the most potent weapons in the fight for global stability and security			2
another @entity108 winner , economist @entity107 , has written that there is no clearer route to economic development and , ultimately , to peace than education			1
in 2011 , 57 million children were out of school ; half of them in countries that are home to armed conflict			2
and that should concern everyone who wants to see a world that is stable , peaceful and secure			2
and yet , today in @entity28 millions of refugee children remain out of school			2
a " no @entity127 " campaign to fund education and support for these children is under way but remains vastly underfunded			1
" before the war , almost all of @entity28 's children were enrolled in school , " according to the charity @entity132			1
today , " @entity28 now has the second worst enrollment rate in the world with almost 3 million school - aged @entity28 children no longer in school			1
" at an event in september hosted by @entity139 envoy @entity138 , frustration was palpable			0
everyone agreed that education was key to guaranteeing that millions of @entity28 children had a chance at a future			1
but getting the world to open up its wallet when it came to keeping them in any kind of classroom has proved more challenging			0
one of the people fighting for that safer world is @entity152 , founder of the @entity153 in once violence - riddled northern @entity86			1
herself a groundbreaker -- as a woman who graduated from college -- @entity157 grew and sold cassava to fund a school that would fight illiteracy and poverty and battle for the rights of children to stay in the classroom			2
" during the war , we would always run with the children from school to the town to hide them , " @entity157 told a reporter			0
" then , during the day we collected them from town again to come and have lessons			0
" @entity157 would not be cowed by the violence around her			0
" i , along with millions of others around the world , mourn these children , my brothers and sisters -- but we will never be defeated , " @entity60 said in her statement			2
that resolve will be required for the fight ahead			0
the militants have shown they will stop at nothing to take the fight to the @entity187			0
and they have made clear the stakes			0
those who care about the future not just of their own children , but the stability and prosperity of the world they will inherit , must agree that the world needs a lot more @entity197 and @entity199 if there are to be fewer blood - soaked days like today			1
and they must fund , support and speak out for the right of every child to have a classroom that does not double as a battle zone			2
it is a shared fight			0
and one in which we all have a stake .			0

@entity213 : @entity10 attack was *n't* a one - off ; schools have been *targeted* often
