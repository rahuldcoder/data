@entity0 are howling in disappointment as their potent -- if unlikely -- symbol of protest once again goes missing from the city 's shelves			1
@entity8 's wolf - like @entity7 doll , which played a cameo in local politics last year , quickly sold out upon its return to the city			1
residents snapped up the stuffed toy in december after one was hurled by a protestor at @entity16 , @entity17 's leader , who is nicknamed " wolf " for his political cunning			2
modeled after the antagonist of the @entity22 fairy tale , @entity7 went on sale at @entity17 's three @entity8 stores on wednesday but quickly sold out as throngs of customers lined up early to get their hands on the toy , which has been out of stock since its rise to prominence in december			1
the @entity31 reported that 2,000 of the toys were made available in the @entity35 furniture giant 's @entity33 , @entity36 and @entity38 stores at a cost of hk $ 99.9 ( $ 13 ) each			0
@entity8 staff handed out tickets to eager customers before the stores opened for business			0
each ticket allowed the purchase of a single doll , although reports of some enterprising customers rejoining the back of the line quickly spread			0
the toys have become a popular symbol of protest against the chief executive , who is criticized in the city as having too close ties to @entity58 , and for putting off his responsibilities to secure universal suffrage for the city 's voters by 2017			1
there is also an element of bawdy humor associated with the toy , whose former @entity68 name is a near - homonym of a crude sexual term in @entity72			0
@entity8 has since updated the name			0
the toy 's popularity remains undiminished , and some of the 50,000 followers of the @entity78 group page expressed their disappointment with @entity8			2
" it 's just improper planning , you ca n't even order one online so people who have to work everyday ca n't get one , " said one disgruntled @entity7 fan			0
however , despite the immediate demand for the toy , the resell market has n't caught fire , with dolls selling on the @entity17 portal of @entity93 for around hk $ 140 - $ 150 ( $ 18 - 19 ) , a modest 40 - 50 % markup			2
@entity8 said that @entity7 would next be in stock around the end of march , although it remains to be seen if he will retain his political potency in the meantime .			1
