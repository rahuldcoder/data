-- the head of @entity3 - based budget airline @entity2 says that airport operators are holding the aviation industry back -- and describes the average airport as an unnecessary " international shopping center			1
" @entity8 , ceo of the carrier he described as " the @entity15 's " of air travel , told @entity0 airport operators were hampering the growth of low - cost flight by leveling unrealistic charges on airlines			1
he questioned the need for the current model of airport , saying changes in technology had rendered many of their operations obsolete			1
" if you look at it , we do n't really need airports to do much any more , " he said			0
" [ the ] airport terminal serves very few purposes any more , except that it is an international shopping center , owned and run by rich airports			1
" costs could be reduced by simplifying the existing model , he said			0
" check in on the website , arrive at the airport , get through security very quickly , and board your plane , " he said			0
" people want to arrive , get on a plane and fly			0
they want to spend time at destinations , not waste it at airports			0
" @entity8 said airports could no longer justify many of the costs they passed on to carriers			1
" in the old regulated environment , when you had the flag carriers charging high fares , the airports were n't very good at costs and passed it on to the airlines			1
those days are over , " he said			0
" @entity2 [ flies ] people all over @entity56 at fares that start at Â £ 10 one way			2
and if you want those low airfares , we need low airport costs			2
" he said the problem was a lack of competition , which meant that many state - owned airports in @entity56 " still think they have a @entity69 - given right to charge " high prices for airlines to use their facilities			1
" we think the way forward is much lower airport fees and much more rapid traffic growth , much more tourism and job growth , " he said			0
preferably , main centers could support a number of competing local airports , in the way @entity83 passengers had the option of @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88			2
" it is a better model , " he said			0
" the competition between the airports keeps prices down , keeps services more efficient , and offers you ultimately more choice and lower prices			1
" he said the @entity56 aviation industry was undergoing a " big change , " and splitting into two sectors			1
he predicted the " three high - fare connecting carriers " -- @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 -- would triumph at the top end of the market , while @entity2 would dominate the low - cost carrier sector			1
" i think you see most of the other flag carriers recognize that they ca n't compete with @entity2 , " he said			2
@entity8 said while @entity2 was affected by the current economic climate , and particularly by high oil prices , the airline tended to do well during economic downturns			1
" what happens in a recession , and what happened in the last three downturns in @entity56 [ is that ] @entity2 has grown faster			2
because people do not stop flying in @entity56 because of a recession , " he said			0
" you see people get much more price sensitive , [ going ] to the lowest price operator , so if they are flying , they fly @entity2			0
" " @entity123 does well in a recession			0
we are the @entity123 , the @entity126 , of the airline business			0

@entity8 , ceo of @entity2 , blames airports for hampering the aviation industry
he believes airport operators charge too much in the current environment of low - cost flight
he says airports provide too many services , passing on the cost on to passengers
*multiple* airports serving major *cities* will *encourage* competition , he argues
