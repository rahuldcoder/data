-- @entity2 mayor @entity1 soon will begin chemotherapy to treat a rare and aggressive cancer , a doctor at @entity6 in the city said wednesday			1
dr. @entity8 said @entity9 has a malignant liposarcoma , and a second biopsy on his tumor done monday shows it is aggressive			2
" however , we are optimistic about this tumor , " @entity8 said			2
@entity1 , who recently announced he will not run for re-election , will start chemotherapy by friday afternoon			1
the cancer has spread from the fatty tissue of @entity9 's abdomen to other parts of his body , including his buttocks , @entity8 said			1
the doctor added that this type of tumor comprises only about 1 % of all cancers and has at least 60 different types of cells , making it difficult to treat			1
@entity8 said there would be 18 days in between chemo and there would be another 18 - day break , after which doctors would reassess @entity9 's treatment plan			1
those three - day rounds of chemotherapy might eventually be followed by surgery , radiation or both , he said			0
the health ailment adds to the list of struggles facing @entity9 , whose fall from grace began in may 2013 with the release of a cell phone video that appeared to show him smoking crack cocaine			0
the @entity2 city council largely stripped him of his mayoral powers months later over those and other allegations of bad behavior			0
@entity9 did n't back down , though , instead vowing " outright war " on the city council			0
the mayor apologized for " a lot of stupid things , " including having used crack cocaine , but he refused to resign or enter rehab			1
in fact , despite all the criticism and his becoming a punchline for jokes in @entity65 as well as the @entity66 , @entity9 launched a bid for re-election			0
this past spring , after a local newspaper reported on a new video that allegedly showed him smoking crack cocaine , @entity9 relented on one front : by going into rehab			0
he returned to work in late june , after a two - month rehab stint , saying he was " ashamed , embarrassed and humiliated " by some of his past actions			1
but he refused to resign or refrain from campaigning , saying to the voters of @entity2 , " i look forward to serving you for many , many more years			0
" @entity9 's term officially ends december 1			0
when he announced his decision not to seek re-election last week , @entity9 has asked his brother , @entity88 , to run for mayor in the october 27 balloting			1
@entity88 released a statement wednesday on behalf of the @entity9 family saying of his brother 's diagnosis : " i ca n't begin to share how devastating this has been for @entity1 and our family			2
" " @entity1 has always been so strong for all of us and now i ask us all to be strong for him , " @entity88 said in the statement , adding , " @entity1 will beat this			2
" @entity0 's @entity102 contributed to this report .			0
