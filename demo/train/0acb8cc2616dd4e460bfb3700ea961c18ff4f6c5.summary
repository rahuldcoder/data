the @entity0 is in town and with it comes sacred flames , security bans , street protests and a bizarre front page depiction of world leaders in various states of undress			1
the @entity10 city of @entity11 arguably has n't seen this much excitement since @entity13 transformed a derelict strip of industrial land into a sprawling souvenir shop and later an inner city beach			1
preparations have been underway for more than two years , since ex-prime minister @entity21 's former @entity20 government proposed the city as a venue for the world 's largest and most influential economic talks			1
current prime minister @entity26 has sworn that this @entity0 " will not be a talkfest			1
" still , over the next few days , political pundits will be scrutinizing the words , actions and gestures of at least 25 world leaders for hints at future policy			2
while they do , here are few lesser - known facts about @entity11 's @entity0			1
there 's a sacred ceremonial fire at least , we hope there is			2
last week , firefighters responded to a 000 call -- @entity10 's version of 911 -- to report an open fire in the city 's @entity45 near the @entity0 center			1
officers duly put it out , only to be confronted by angry @entity51 elders of the @entity53 tribe who had lit the sacred ceremonial flame for @entity0 , according to @entity57 reporter @entity56			1
" they accosted the firefighters , yelling at them , a fair bit of swearing , accusing them of deliberately attempting to extinguish the fire as they knew that it was their sacred fire , " @entity56 told @entity58			2
the embers used to light the blaze came from the fire burning at the @entity67 in @entity68 , the headquarters of a long campaign for recognition and compensation for the theft of @entity51 land			0
during a march through the city on monday , activists stopped in the middle of the street and broke into traditional dance , @entity56 said			2
more protests are planned during @entity0			1
banned : eggs , stones , insects if you thought about taking your lizard for a walk through inner city @entity11 this week think again			1
" a reptile , insect , or other animal capable of causing physical harm if released in close proximity to a person " are banned from key areas of the city , according to the government 's @entity0 security law			1
you ca n't carry an egg , stone , metal cans , tins or glass bottles , and especially not ones that contain urine or manure , which are also on the banned list			0
of course , crossbows are out and it would be best to leave your whips at home			0
step away from the mayonnaise the threat of terrorism may be on the minds of police chiefs , but the state 's top doctor has said she 's more worried about egg mayonnaise			0
local caterers are expecting to prepare around 100,000 meals for delegates , media and police over the two - day event , creating a potential @entity125 minefield			2
" we 've seen quite a few outbreaks in @entity128 over the last few years , mainly due to raw eggs , " dr. @entity126 told the @entity10			0
" my personal view is we should all shy away from raw egg mayonnaise at all times , " she said			0
cheese please @entity134 president @entity133 is known to love a cheese burger , which is presumably why @entity137 's @entity136 has created the @entity138			1
either that or they fancied some free publicity			0
the towering burger includes two @entity143 beef patties , cheese ( of course ) , onions , onion rings , spinach , tomato , cucumbers and mustard			0
fans of local burger delicacies , beetroot and pineapple , will have to look elsewhere			2
mind the signs a row has erupted over signs at @entity137 , which would have been some of the first images delegates saw as they make their way through arrivals			1
the rejected slogans , submitted by @entity165 20 ( @entity166 ) and @entity167 included : " if corruption was an industry it would be the world 's third largest			0
" and " women comprise 70 % of the world 's poor			0
" @entity137 tweeted : " we do n't accept any political ads , whether from parties , cause based organizations or individuals , regardless of issue / message			1
" @entity166 spokesman @entity181 said : " it 's a sad day for @entity10 if talking about inequality , climate change or corruption are deemed too political			0
" the airport is offering a billboard of world leaders to satisfy demands for selfies			0
still at the airport ... possibly the people most excited about @entity0 right now are about 120 plane spotters who are at @entity137 eagerly awaiting the arrival of planes never before seen the country			1
" the mood is excellent			0
people are excited about these aircraft visiting and how it puts @entity11 on the map in a global sense , " @entity199 from @entity200 told @entity58			1
" some of these aircraft will probably never visit @entity11 again so it really is a one in a lifetime opportunity for aviation photographers			2
" the most anticipated touchdowns are president @entity210 's @entity209 and @entity133 's @entity211			2
" everyone 's hoping for @entity211 but it probably wo n't happen , " plane spotter @entity212 told the @entity57			0
" i 'd be ecstatic			0
that would be the pinnacle of everything			0
