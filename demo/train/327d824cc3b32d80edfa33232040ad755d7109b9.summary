since taking power in 2010 , @entity32 has freed dozens of prisoners of conscience , but activists have been pushing for the release of around 200 more			1
according to state run newspaper , the @entity45 of @entity1 , @entity32 said the prisoner release scheme was executed " with the sheer intention of forging national reconciliation , " adding that political gain was not the government 's motive			1
@entity32 's efforts to rectify the wrongs of the past have scored him political points with foreign leaders and investors , however not all locals are convinced that the country 's transformation is doing anything for them			1
early tuesday morning in the busy @entity64 in downtown @entity6 , traders told @entity2 that they had seen little change			1

the 72 - year - old was begging for a note or two of the local currency , the kyat			2
the typically dirty , crumpled notes are worth about 940 to one @entity78 dollar			2
two hundred kyat gets you a ride on a crowded bus			2
more buys a decent meal			2

" as the task is huge , there have been tangible changes rather than vivid changes			0

the government has achieved some success in negotiating peace with ethnic rebels around the country , most recently signing a seven - point agreement in @entity152 , but the religious violence is relatively new and poses additional problems for the country 's leaders			0
