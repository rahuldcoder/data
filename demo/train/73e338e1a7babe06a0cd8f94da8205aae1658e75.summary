-- the agreement between president @entity2 and president @entity3 of @entity4 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is the most important advance in the several decades - long history of international climate negotiations			1
it has been greeted with rage by those in @entity12 whose positions on the science are denialist or evasive ( " i am not a scientist " )			0
their criticisms are specious and predictable			0
but while most climate scientists i know are still sharing a period of joy following its announcement , some substantive criticisms of the agreement have also been raised			2
i want to address two of them here			0
one is that the agreement does n't do enough to solve the problem of global warming			1
the other is that it does n't promise anything that was n't likely to happen anyway			2
both of these criticisms have some truth , but neither diminishes the importance of what presidents @entity2 and @entity3 have achieved			0
first , critics say the agreement does n't go far enough			1
the argument here is that the emissions cuts will not be enough to limit the global mean surface temperature increase to 2 degrees @entity44 , the benchmark beyond which climate change will be " dangerous , " according to the nonbinding international agreement reached in @entity49 in 2009			1
the new @entity51 - @entity4 agreement alone is indeed very unlikely to keep future warming below @entity53			1
to achieve @entity53 , further cuts beyond those spelled out in the agreement will be needed			2
or -- or better , and -- we need @entity59 's climate sensitivity ( how much warming we 'll get for a given level of greenhouse gas increases ) not to be at the high end of the range that the best current science , with its attendant uncertainties , has it			2
the first is within the control of the world 's politicians			2
on the second , we all just have to hope -- and we scientists have to keep working hard to try to reduce the uncertainties			0
but we have to take success where we can get it			0
after decades of failed climate talks -- in which the @entity51 was often a big part of the reason for failure and @entity4 was a big part of our excuse for dragging our feet -- this is every bit the political breakthrough it appears to be			1
while it 's not enough on its own , the momentum could n't be more welcome after so many years of inaction and bad news			1
it was gratifying to see president @entity2 pushing the issue at the @entity94 summit in @entity95 , a country with as much denialism in its current government as the @entity51			1
further , while we need goals , and @entity53 is an important one , we have to understand that we do n't get to give up if we miss them			0
if @entity53 is dangerous , @entity101 or @entity102 is more so			0
emissions reductions that do n't get us where we want to be are still a lot better than none at all			1
the second big criticism is that the emissions cuts might have happened anyway			0
the argument here is that @entity2 had already committed to cuts putting us along the trajectory in the agreement until 2020 ( with the @entity114 regulation of carbon dioxide as a pollutant and the new rules on power plants ) and has now just extended the same trajectory to 2025			1
similarly , some argue that the @entity4 too would be aiming for their targets in the agreement even without it			1
on the @entity51 side , at least , the howls from @entity12 show that this argument is n't completely true			1
it will take real political capital for @entity2 , or any future @entity51 president , to fight off the attacks of the deniers and fossil fuel industry shills			1
and the new targets certainly represent a major policy change for @entity4 as well - even if it 's one they were ready to make , recognizing a need to cut back on coal for air pollution as well as climate reasons			1
but for the sake of argument , let 's accept this criticism as true			0
this is not something wrong ; history suggests that it 's how these agreements work , when they work			0
the most successful global environmental agreement to date is the 1987 @entity149 , which began the phasing out of chlorofluorocarbons ( @entity152 ) in order to stop the depletion of stratospheric ozone			0
the @entity149 did n't happen because politicians found a way to force recalcitrant factions in government and industry to go along with it			0
it happened because the chemical manufacturers had already come up with @entity152 substitutes			0
they were not just ready to accept the protocol 's restrictions ; they were looking forward to selling a whole lot of new air conditioners and refrigerators			0
unfortunately , the currently available alternatives to fossil fuels are not as ready to take over our energy systems now as the @entity152 substitutes were ready to take over our refrigeration systems in 1987			0
and neither government nor the private sector has made the large - scale investments in getting them ready that the scale of the problem warrants			1
under the circumstances , this new agreement could n't realistically solve climate as completely as the @entity149 solved ozone			2
but it 's a sign that things have started to move			0
if the @entity51 and @entity4 had reached an agreement now that everyone could agree was definitely enough to keep us below @entity53 -- despite the political challenges , the technical challenges and the possibility of a more rather than less sensitive climate -- it would have been at best highly aspirational , at worst simply unrealistic			1
so indeed , the actual agreement is far from a complete solution to the climate problem			2
but it 's a huge step forward			1
and it is one not despite the fact that its goals are attainable , but because of that			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity205 .			2

@entity51 - @entity4 accord on curbing carbon emissions is a huge step , says @entity205
he says critics who say it does n't go far enough are in danger of missing **key** points
a more far - reaching agreement would n't have been possible at this point , he says
@entity205 : the **key** thing is that there 's finally momentum toward solving the problem
