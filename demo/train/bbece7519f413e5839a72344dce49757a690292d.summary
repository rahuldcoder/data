if you 're having trouble getting pregnant or have suffered a miscarriage , some common household products may be partly to blame , new research suggests			0
this week , scientists at the annual conference of the @entity7 in @entity8 are presenting research linking chemical compounds in our environment to fertility issues			1
in several different studies , researchers met with healthy couples who were trying to have a baby and tested them for bpa and phthalates			1
@entity18 stands for @entity18 , a chemical used to make certain plastics and resins that are used in containers			1
@entity18 is also used in the coating of metal products , such as food cans , bottle tops and water supply lines , according to the @entity29			2
some studies have even found @entity18 in cash register receipts			2
phthalates are a group of chemicals used to make plastics more flexible and harder to break			0
they are used in products such as detergents , beauty products and children 's toys			0
people are also exposed to phthalates by eating and drinking from containers containing them , according to the @entity44			0
previous studies -- primarily in rodents -- have linked bpa exposure to many health problems , including reproductive disorders , but at this point the @entity29 says that it has " carefully assessed these studies and finds no convincing evidence to support that belief			1
" phthalates have been linked to health issues such as male sexual development and attention - deficit disorder in children			2
" it 's not clear what effect , if any , phthalates have on health , " the @entity29 says , noting that there is insufficient evidence of harmful effects to take regulatory action			0
@entity18 may reduce sperm count more evidence may be on the way			2
one study presented at the conference looked at 501 couples who were trying to become pregnant			2
the couples in the study were interviewed and examined and provided urine samples to measure their bpa and phthalate levels			1
they also kept journals about intercourse , menstrual cycles and pregnancy tests			0
researchers found that the men -- but not women -- with high phthalate concentrations experienced a 20 % decline in fertility and took longer to get their partners pregnant than men with lower concentrations			1
phthalates are known endocrine disruptors , meaning they interfere with our hormone systems , said @entity7 president @entity95 , who was not involved in the research			2
if a couple is having trouble getting pregnant , they should try to minimize the male 's exposure to phthalates , @entity95 says			0
" phthalates are anti-androgens , and other studies have shown that environmental levels of phthalates in infertile men correlate with increased rates of sperm dna damage , low sperm counts and abnormal sperm , " she said			1
in another smaller study presented at the conference , 114 women were asked to give blood samples four or five weeks into their pregnancies			1
the samples were n't tested for @entity18 until after the women gave birth to live babies or after they had a miscarriage if it occurred in the first trimester			1
sixty - eight of the pregnancies ended in miscarriages			0
researchers concluded that women who had high levels of @entity18 in their blood were at " significantly increased risk of miscarriage compared to women with the lowest levels			1
" they believe that more research on how this chemical affects pregnancy is urgently needed			0
" we expected bpa exposure to be associated with an increased risk of aneuploidy ( genetic defects in ) miscarriages because of animal studies linking bpa exposure with chromosome abnormalities in eggs , " study author dr. @entity138 said			2
" ( but ) we found @entity18 was higher in both chromosomally normal and abnormal miscarriages			1
" @entity18 may be linked to childhood obesity @entity138 suggests that the @entity18 " may be acting in other ways to cause miscarriages			1
we just do n't know the mechanism at this time			0
" researchers say they do n't know why certain women in the study had higher bpa levels ; they did not ask whether the women were doing specific things like leaving their plastic water bottles outside in the heat , something thought to increase bpa levels in the water dramatically			1
it 's not routine to do @entity18 testing in patients who are struggling to carry a child to term , said dr. @entity170 , a fertility expert at @entity171 in @entity172 who was not involved in the research			1
but , she says , studies like this further highlight the impact the environment can have on fertility and miscarriage			0
" it gives you one more thing to ask the patients about when you see unexplained miscarriages in patients			0
" neither study showed an actual cause and effect			0
but @entity95 says there are ways to minimize exposure to @entity18 if parents are worried			2
she advises against leaving plastic water bottles in the car , microwaving plastic containers , eating canned foods and touching paper receipts that contain @entity18			0
the @entity29 also warns against putting very hot or boiling liquid in plastic containers made with @entity18 if you plan to consume the water			0
that 's because @entity18 levels rise in food when containers or products made with the chemical are heated and come in contact with the food , according to the agency			1
for that reason , the @entity29 also no longer allows bpa in plastic used to make baby bottles and toddler cups .			0
