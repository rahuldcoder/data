" @entity1 " may have soared in the movies			1
but as a video game , it was an epic turkey			2
when electronics pioneer @entity5 rushed a game based on the 1982 @entity9 blockbuster to market for its then - dominant home consoles , it was a flop , compounded by the fact that the infant industry was hitting its first slump at the time			1
so @entity5 literally buried the project , dumping truckloads of unsold games in a desert landfill in @entity19			1
and amid a decade of entertainment - industry disasters bookended by the movie " @entity22 " and @entity23 , the " @entity1 " game quickly faded into urban legend			1
" riiiight , " you say			0
and over the weekend , with a couple of hundred onlookers watching , excavators led by a documentary film crew began to unearth stacks of 30 - year - old @entity5 cartridges from a landfill outside @entity33			1
" urban legend confirmed , " @entity34 , one of the creators of @entity38 's @entity37 gaming platform , reported via @entity39 from the dig site			0
@entity38 's @entity42 is one of the backers of the planned documentary , tentatively titled " @entity5 : @entity46			1
" @entity34 also tweeted a photo of the first cartridge to be dug out			0
not so fast , @entity5 historian @entity49 said monday			1
" @entity1 " cartridges were just one of more than 20 titles found over the weekend , and may not make up more than a fifth of the estimated 700,000 - plus units the ailing @entity5 discarded in 1983 , he said			1
as far as he 's concerned , the great " @entity1 " caper remains " a myth			1
" " this was a write - off dump , " said @entity49 , the co-author of a 2012 book on the company			1
@entity5 was being hit from all sides by a saturated market for arcade games , competition from other companies making games for its famous 2600 console and by a large volume of returns from retailers -- a problem it had never before faced and was n't prepared to handle			2
" poor sales , the video game crash , ' @entity1 's ' not a great game -- the whole thing kind of snowballs together , and then you find @entity5 is dumping cartridges in the desert , " he said			1
" that 's how this whole myth kind of self - generated			0
" one of those on hand at the landfill saturday was @entity86 , the game 's designer			1
when excavators started to retrieve the first of what may be hundreds of thousands of copies of his misbegotten baby , " everybody went nuts , " @entity86 said			0
" i 've been carrying this thing , the theoretically worst video game of all time , for 30 years now , " he said			2
" it was a game that was done in five weeks			0
it was a very brief development			0
i did the best that i could , and that 's ok			0
" but seeing the cartridges emerge from the desert dust was a rush for @entity86 , who 's now a @entity104 psychotherapist			0
" something that i did 32 years ago is still creating joy and excitement for people , " he said			1
" that 's a tremendously satisfying thing for me now			0
" today 's @entity5 , which still sells games but no longer makes its own platforms , did not respond to a request for comment sunday			2
the original company folded in 1984 , and several successive companies have bought the name , @entity49 said			0
" @entity1 " was rushed to stores in time for christmas 1982 , hobbled not only by its short development time but by a license and royalty agreement that promised the film 's director , @entity122 , $ 21 million , @entity49 said			1
the company needed to sell out of the 5 million units it produced to break even ; it sold about 3.5 million by the following fall , he said			0
by that time , @entity5 was collapsing			2
about the time " @entity1 " hit the shelves , a poor and badly delayed earnings report spooked investors , " and everybody started running to go sell , " @entity49 said			2
at its peak , it employed about 11,000 people ; it was shedding employees by the thousands in 1983 , and had only about 900 left by the time it closed down			0
" they were just cutting the meat off the bone , " he said			0
and so in 1983 , the company dumped 14 truckloads of merchandise from its service center in @entity145 , @entity146 , in the @entity33 landfill , about 90 miles away , @entity49 said			1
to keep scavengers from reselling them , the cartridges were covered by a layer of concrete			0
none of the " @entity1 " cartridges unearthed over the weekend was playable , @entity86 said			2
but he said there may be as many as 750,000 of them in the landfill , with many successful titles mixed in with the " @entity1 " games			1
" it was the end of the first product life cycle , and nobody really knew what they were doing , " @entity86 said			0
now , manufacturers are designing their next systems even as their new ones start shipping to stores			0
" it was a very wacky company , but that 's one of the things that made it amazing place to work , " said @entity86 , who 's come to embrace the game 's infamy			2
" i do n't really believe it 's one of the worst games ever , but i really like it when people identify it that way , " @entity86 told @entity179			0
and because he also designed of one of @entity5 's best - rated games , " @entity184 , " he said , " i have the greatest range of any game designer in history			1

not so fast , @entity5 historian says : @entity1 copies may not be the bulk of the dump
