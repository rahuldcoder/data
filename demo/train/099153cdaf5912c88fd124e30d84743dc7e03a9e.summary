a damning new video shown wednesday at the trial of @entity2 , captain of the wrecked @entity5 cruise liner , appears to show him boarding a lifeboat with passengers still clearly on board the doomed ship			1
it was presented to the court as @entity13 took the stand for a second day			1
@entity13 's lawyer , @entity15 , asked the court not to admit the fuzzy videotape that appeared to show the captain getting onto a lifeboat from the ship 's bow wearing the same jacket and tie he had on at dinner before the ship crashed			1
but the judge ruled that @entity13 could be questioned about it			2
the captain has previously said he was thrown off the cruise liner into a lifeboat as the ship listed sharply			1
morning testimony focused on the chain of command aboard the doomed cruise liner , with @entity13 admitting to the court that his aim in sailing close to @entity36 -- leading the ship to hit rocks -- was to " impress the passengers			1
" earlier , he had denied that the ill - fated maneuver was to impress @entity41 dancer @entity2			1
' i did n't want to cause a panic ' on tuesday , he blamed others for failures that led to the crash and 32 deaths , but on wednesday , he said the ship was his responsibility alone			0
" as commander , i was second only to @entity52 , " he told the court			0
@entity13 was pressed about why he waited more than an hour to give the order to abandon the ship , even though it was clearly an emergency situation with the engine rooms flooded and the ship listing			1
he told the court , " i wanted to calm the passengers , i did n't want to cause a panic and have people start jumping into the water			0
" when pressed further , he said , " i waited to give the general emergency because i knew exactly how the ship would drift			0
i know the @entity5 well			2
i wanted to make sure that the ship was closer to the island and then give the general emergency			0
the damage was already done			0
" referring to his crew , he said , " i had 600 people who had never done a similar exercise with a ship in this position since the rules do not require it			2
" and the words ' abandon ship ' can be open to interpretation : maybe people would jump into the sea			2
instead , seeing that the ship was approaching the island anyway , i waited			0
" captain confident about trial @entity13 -- who is charged with manslaughter , causing a maritime disaster and abandoning ship with passengers still on board -- denies wrongdoing			1
he faces up to 23 years in prison if convicted			0
on tuesday , he was defiant and combative as he answered the prosecutor 's questions in a makeshift courtroom in the @entity91 in the @entity93 town of @entity94			0
speaking to @entity95 during a court break , he said he was " confident " about the way the trial was going			0
" it is exhausting , but i think it is going well , " @entity13 said			2
" it is important because this is the only chance i have to tell my version of events			0
" the cruise liner capsized after it struck rocks off @entity107 's @entity36 in the @entity108 on january 12 , 2012			1
no one died on impact , but 32 lives were lost during the subsequent chaotic evacuation of about 4,200 people aboard the ship .			1
