-- the tornado - ravaged city of @entity3 , @entity4 , is an authentic @entity6 crossroads , a truck stop and regional mecca with a rich mining heritage that straddles a cultural vein linking the @entity11 and the @entity12			1
hugging @entity4 's southwestern border , @entity3 is bigger and more influential than the dot on the @entity6 map may indicate , and really ca n't be defined without recognizing its importance as a hub , its current and former residents say			1
the city numbers about 50,000 , its two - county metro area in @entity4 is about 175,000 , and thousands more people live in neighboring regions of @entity23 , @entity24 , and @entity25			1
in fact , the city says , there are about 400,000 people in a 40 - mile radius of the city , making it @entity4 's fourth - largest region			1
it is inextricably tied -- economically and culturally -- to the smaller communities around it , as people in nearby hamlets travel to @entity3 for employment , medical care , a movie on friday night , or a late night stopover on a journey			1
and , @entity43 have jobs in other towns outside the city			2
" it 's easy to look at us and say we 're this little hillbilly town in southwest @entity4 , " said @entity46 , professor of history emeritus at @entity47			2
" i think it 's unfair			2
" founded in the late 19th century , the @entity3 area and neighboring parts of @entity23 and @entity25 constituted a major center of zinc and lead mining , starting out with individual operators and followed by bigger companies			1
" there 's is a real spirit of individualism , " @entity46 said , describing the mining industry 's legacy			1
" taking care of yourself and doing for yourself			2
" it 's a town with names that ring through @entity6 history , @entity3 was a hideout for @entity70 and their gang in the 1930s and the birthplace of african - american poet @entity75			1
the mining industry and the gritty world of the 19th and 20th centuries have faded away and the region has been making the transition to different white - collar and blue - collar industries			1
but @entity83 , a native of nearby @entity85 , @entity4 , and now a history professor at the @entity87 in @entity88 , said the character of the town is strongly linked with the tri-state mining region			1
@entity83 said the town 's " hardscrabble qualities " give @entity3 " a wonderful sense of character , a wonderful sense of community , of local meaning			1
" " it 's quite surprising that it has remained as large as it is , " he said			0
trucking is a major industry in the region , and highways such as @entity103 and @entity6 71 carry drivers to and from big cities like @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity25 , and @entity109 , @entity24			1
another major place of industry is @entity47 , a revered institution spared by the tornado			1
but as in many @entity6 towns , people get an education at a place like @entity47 , and then they head out			0
" we 'd give young people from the area the tools to leave , " said @entity117 , a history professor at @entity118 who used to teach at @entity47			0
" it 's the truth			0
a really bright young person with a college education would head off to @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity106			0
" the hospitals are another major industry			1
there 's @entity127 , which dodged the tornado bullet , and @entity129 , which got slammed			0
" it seems that most of the jobs requiring college education have to do with teaching , medical , " said @entity130 , a history professor at the @entity131 who got her bachelor 's degree at @entity47			0
" this is going to be a real blow			0
" there are other industries in and around @entity3 : one is @entity141 in @entity3 , which designs and makes batteries and battery management systems for the defense and aerospace industries			1
" @entity149 's batteries helped bring the crew of the @entity152 home safely , " its website says			0
@entity154 , in nearby @entity153 , is a diversified manufacturer that produces bed and furniture components and other items			0
@entity158 , @entity154 staff vice president of labor relations , said there are more than 2,100 employees in the @entity153 area and many of them are from @entity3			1
@entity164 's home base is not far away in @entity165 , @entity24 , and there 's @entity167 , which provides electricity to southwestern @entity4 and parts of @entity24 , @entity23 , and @entity25			0
there also are chicken farms and processing plants			0
" the region is sort of a transition between the @entity12 and the @entity11 , " @entity117 said			2
" historically , ( with ) lead and zinc , like a lot of mining areas , it was sort of a boom and a bust , " the region is largely white and @entity184 , a town full of churches , @entity117 said , and it is gritty and blue collar			1
he and others note a growth in the @entity192 presence and other newcomers , such as @entity194			0
there is a @entity197 community and many people in the area have that ancestry			0
there is a small but long - standing black community			2
the city has historically appeared to be more tolerant than smaller nearby hamlets in the past , historians said			2
@entity83 said some african - americans found their way to @entity3 when they were driven out of neighboring communities last century			1
@entity130 , who studied the integration of @entity3 schools , said she found it was n't as difficult as it had been in other cities			1
it has had more of a " northern attitude " and more of a sense of community , she said			0
' it 's sort of southern , " she said			0
" but it 's not part of the @entity220			0
" one part of life across this swath of @entity6 is the weather			0
three years ago , a tornado ravaged the town of @entity227 , @entity25 , 20 miles away , and continued into @entity4			0
roll attended a wedding south of @entity3 that day , and one casualty of the tornado was a man who had been scheduled to sing at the wedding but was killed in his car on the way			2
the aftermath of tornadoes evokes an eeriness , @entity83 remembers			0
" it becomes very , very still , calm , sun - shining			2

trucking is a big industry in the city , which is crossed by major highways
