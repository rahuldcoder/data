pervasive fear and denial are challenging authorities in west africa who are trying to assess and address the @entity7 crisis			1
so far , it has killed more than 650 people , says @entity10			1
that 's the highest death toll the @entity12 has recorded in an @entity7 outbreak			1
and it 's getting worse			1
the swelling numbers prompted heads of state to cancel travel plans on thursday to direct their full attention toward fighting the outbreak of the virus that has crippled parts of @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 and stirred palpable concerns that it will spread around the region and the world			1
@entity22 president @entity30 and @entity23 's president @entity31 both canceled trips to the @entity33 , and @entity31 declared a state of emergency			1
he announced a action plan that addressed many of the barriers international medical workers complain they face while fighting disease			1
some residents in affected villages have accused them of bringing the disease into the country and have barricaded their towns or otherwise blocked access to ebola hemorrhagic fever victims			1
a nurse with @entity10 , @entity48 , told @entity0 , " the most challenging " aspect of trying to help people is that " we go into communities where we are not necessarily welcome , " because people do n't want to believe they or their loved ones have @entity7 -- in part because " they understand now that the survival rate is not very high			1
" @entity31 said he will deploy police and military to accompany the aid workers			1
they will search house to house for the infirm and enforce orders designed to curb the virus ' spread			1
what is the risk of catching @entity7 on a plane ? aid groups pull out " the matter has reached a crisis point , " @entity22 information minister @entity71 told @entity0 's @entity72			1
" ... the dire prognosis is that it will get worse before it gets better			2
" the dangers are so real that some humanitarian organizations are pulling out to protect their own			1
@entity78 -- an international evangelical christian humanitarian agency -- and the missionary group @entity80 have recalled all nonessential personnel from @entity22			1
the @entity82 announced wednesday it is doing the same , removing its 340 volunteers from that country , as well as @entity23 and @entity24			1
while there are no confirmed cases , a spokeswoman for the agency did say that two volunteers did come in contact with someone who ended up dying from the virus			1
those @entity33 have n't shown signs of @entity7 but are being isolated just in case , with the spokeswoman saying they ca n't return home until they get medical clearance to do so			2
@entity33 dies one @entity33 , 40 - year - old @entity99 , died in a @entity101 hospital earlier this month -- having come from @entity22 , where he was a top @entity103 official , and before he could go back home to @entity105 to celebrate his daughters ' birthdays			2
but the vast majority of those afflicted are @entity110			2
they come from big cities and small villages , some of them falling ill without really knowing what hit them			2
" this epidemic is without precedent , " said @entity116 , director of operations for @entity10 , a group also known as @entity120 © decins @entity122 @entity121 ¨ res. " it 's absolutely not under control , and the situation keeps worsening			2
" as of now , the outbreak has been confined to @entity127			2
but there are rising concerns that it could spread , especially since a person may not know they have @entity7 or show symptoms for two to 21 days after being infected			2
@entity99 , for example , collapsed getting off a plane in @entity135 , @entity101			2
he very well could have made it out of the region , perhaps to the @entity33 , before showing symptoms of @entity7 ; it 's only then that the virus spreads			1
to further complicate matters , signs of @entity7 include fever , headaches , weakness and vomiting -- symptoms that also define many other ailments , from malaria to the flu that @entity71 notes often pop up " at this time of year			1
" for all these reasons and more , @entity116 says , " if the situation does not improve fairly quickly , there is a real risk for new countries to be affected			2
" could outbreak spread to @entity33 ? 2 infected @entity33 @entity7 spreads through the transmission of bodily fluids			0
those most at risk are loved ones of those infected , as well as health care workers tending to the ill. @entity99 is believed to have been infected by his ailing sister , who he spent time with in @entity22 -- even though neither likely knew she had @entity7 -- according to @entity71			0
then there are those like dr. sheik @entity167 , who fell ill early last week while overseeing @entity7 treatment at a @entity23 hospital and died days later			0
two @entity33 affiliated with @entity78 who also were infected " have shown a slight improvement in the past 24 hours " though both are in serious condition , according to the @entity174 humanitarian agency			1
one of them is dr. @entity176 , a 33 - year - old who last lived in @entity177 , @entity178			0
he has been the medical director for the @entity179 in @entity180 , @entity22 , where he has been providing care for @entity7 patients since october			0
after testing positive for the virus , @entity176 went into treatment at @entity185			0
the other is @entity186 , @entity187 , resident @entity188 , a @entity190 member working with @entity78 to help fight the @entity7 outbreak			0
ebola fears hit close to home it is believed one of the local staff was infected with @entity7 and came to work with the virus on july 21 and 22 , @entity78 vice president @entity194 said			1
that staff member died thursday			0
" we think it was in the scrub - down area where the disease was passed to both @entity188 and @entity204 , " he said			0
@entity71 , the @entity22 information minister , noted @entity176 and @entity188 's fight in his @entity0 interview , as well as @entity22 's need for more health care workers like them			0
" we join the families in prayers that they can come through this and become ... shining examples that , if care is taken , one can come out of this			0
" @entity22 president : ' @entity7 kills ' on monday , the @entity218 issued an alert warning travelers to avoid hospitals with @entity7 patients and funerals for those patients in @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 due to the outbreak			0
the @entity33 is considering raising the alert to discourage " nonessential " travel to those three countries , a spokesman said			0
@entity22 president @entity30 has told the @entity229 to consider quarantines in some areas and cremating bodies in an attempt to prevent further infection , according to @entity71			0
the president also urged residents to avoid public amusement and entertainment areas , and set aside friday " for the disinfection and chlorination of all public facilities			0
" " my fellow @entity22 , @entity7 is real			0
and @entity7 kills , " @entity30 said			0
" all of us must all take extra measures announced by the @entity229 to keep ourselves safe			0
" the government will do its part			0
but you must do yours			0
" @entity0 's @entity247 , @entity248 , @entity249 and @entity250 contributed to this report .			0
