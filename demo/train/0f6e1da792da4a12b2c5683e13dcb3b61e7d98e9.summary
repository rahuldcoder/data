hundreds of students and youth organizers were arrested outside the @entity2 sunday as they protested against the @entity3 under review by the @entity6 administration			1
some demonstrators zip - tied their hands to the @entity2 fence , and others acted out a " human oil spill , " lying on black tarps in front of the @entity2			1
nearly a thousand students began their march at @entity16 and proceeded to the outside of secretary of state @entity20 's @entity19 home , where they created a smaller human oil spill			1
marchers then headed to @entity24 for a rally			2
afterward , around a third of the crowd then peacefully moved to the @entity2 fence			1
participants said they hoped that a strong statement from younger voters would further pressure president @entity6 to reject the project			1
" ( this is ) a youth - organized action to tell president @entity6 to reject the @entity3 , " said @entity32 , who participated in @entity33 , the name of the rally			1
" because the youth vote was a crucial part in both of his elections , we know that we elected him and we voted for a climate champion , not another pipeline president			1
" the $ 5.3 billion pipeline , which would begin in northern @entity46 , @entity47 , would transport tar sands oil over 1,179 miles through @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 to connect with existing segments in @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			2
once completed , it would carry 830,000 barrels a day to @entity58 and @entity59 on the @entity60			0
proponents of the pipeline point to the thousands of potential jobs that could result from its construction			0
environmental groups oppose the pipeline because extracting and refining the tar sands oil emits 17 % more of the carbon pollution that contributes to climate change than conventional oil production			2
environmental advocates also say projects like the pipeline reinforce @entity77 dependence on fossil fuels rather than encourage green technologies			0
the project by @entity81 still needs federal approval because the pipeline would cross an international border			0
the @entity85 released an environmental report on the pipeline january 31			0
the public now has 90 - day period for public comment and consultation			0
@entity32 expressed considerable skepticism about the report			0
" the report that came out of the @entity85 is as dirty as the pipeline itself , " he said			0
" any suggestion that an 800,000 barrel a day oil sands pipeline will not contribute to climate change is incorrect			2
" @entity20 , who is known for his effort to combat climate change , will determine if the pipeline project is in the national interest and make a recommendation to @entity6			1
the final call rests with the president .			0
