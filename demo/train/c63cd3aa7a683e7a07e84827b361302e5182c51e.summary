-- @entity1 was shy as a child ; he could n't look people in the eyes , so he stared at the ground			1
and that , he says , is where he found mushrooms			0
today , that shyness has faded , but mushrooms are even more of a focal point			0
@entity1 is one of the most prominent proponents of using mushrooms for medicinal purposes			1
besides traveling the world to look for exotic mushrooms , he also lectures about them and runs a mushroom supplement company with his wife called @entity22			0
when he spoke at @entity23 in october , he even wore a mushroom -- his hat is made from birch polypore , which is also thought to have medicinal uses			0
why are n't mushrooms being used more often for medicinal purposes ? despite documented use of mushrooms in other cultures ( for instance , ancient @entity33 ) thousands of years ago , @entity1 says some people have a fear of mushrooms -- mycophobia -- because the fungi are ephemeral and powerful			1
they have the power to feed you , make you high or even harm you , but they do n't last very long			0
" people 's paranoia is a reflex of their not understanding something that 's so mysterious , " he said			2
" i was always attracted to that which was forbidden , and these were forbidden fruits			0
" @entity1 is n't the only one who 's excited about mushrooms			1
@entity52 , a professor in @entity54 's @entity53 and @entity55 , does n't like the taste of them , but thinks there 's a lot of potential for mushrooms ' healing properties			1
" in the next 10 years , we 'll just see an incredible expansion of our awareness of chemicals in mushrooms , hopefully even their use in conventional medicine , " says @entity52 , who teaches a course on mushrooms at @entity54 and once had dinner with @entity1			1
you might know of only a handful of mushroom types , but there are more than 150,000 species of mushrooms , @entity1 says			1
still , only 14,000 have been identified , and @entity1 and colleagues are still looking			2
in @entity52 's view , shiitake mushrooms have the longest track record of research in health benefits			1
chemicals in them may stimulate the immune system and lower cholesterol			0
@entity90 button mushrooms found in salad are also high in vitamin b complex , and the antioxidant properties of mushrooms could protect against heart disease and cancer			2
and even hallucinogenic mushrooms are proving to have clinical uses			1
@entity100 , one of the psychedelic compounds in " magic " mushrooms , may have uses for depression , a study recently suggested			0
there has also been research showing that healthy people given this drug in an experimental setting report having life - changes experiences and positive effects from them that last up to 25 years			2
the research on all these mushrooms is still preliminary , so there 's no way to say for sure that mushrooms are going to add years to your life			1
but @entity1 points to his mother as a living example of how useful mushrooms may be			1
@entity123 , 86 , had stage 4 metastatic breast cancer in 2009 , and doctors gave her three months to live			0
but after a year of turkey tail mushroom supplement in addition to the standard drugs @entity127 ( paclitaxel ) and @entity129 ( trastuzumab ) , she had no detectable cancer			0
still , it 's not clear that the mushrooms were the whole story			2
@entity139 tail mushrooms may have some ability to boost the immune system , but there 's so much unpredictability about cancer that it 's hard to say how much they did on top of the standard medications , @entity52 said			1
he thinks that trying experimental mushroom supplements to potentially help treat cancer is worth considering , but not without a physician 's consultation			0
@entity1 himself eats mushrooms three to four times a week , and he recommends that everyone else do the same			1
always cook mushrooms to get their immune - boosting benefits , he says			0
cooking also destroys any toxins that may be present in edible mushrooms such as shiitake and morels ( but not poisonous mushrooms such as death caps ) , @entity52 notes			2
@entity1 likes his mushrooms crispy brown			2
" these are functional foods , " he says			0
" it 's a misconception to think of them as drugs			0

@entity1 says he believes people are *afraid* of mushrooms because they are powerful
@entity52 says he thinks there 's a lot of potential for mushrooms ' healing properties
even hallucinogenic mushrooms are proving to have clinical uses , research shows
