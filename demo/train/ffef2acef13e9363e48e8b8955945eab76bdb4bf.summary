-- a self - help guru who was convicted in the deaths of three participants in an @entity7 sweat lodge ceremony deserves a new trial , his attorneys argued tuesday			1
@entity9 was found guilty of negligent homicide in the deaths of the participants , but an @entity7 jury in june deemed him not guilty of manslaughter charges			1
negligent homicide means a defendant should have known better , while manslaughter suggests that the defendant knew and blatantly disregarded this knowledge			1
@entity9 's attorneys went before a @entity21 judge in @entity22 , @entity7 , claiming he should be tried again because of prosecutorial misconduct , a court official said			2
the official , who was not authorized to speak to the media , said the hearing started shortly after 11 a.m. mt and ran until a lunch break			0
the hearing is scheduled to run for the rest of the day			0
the defense claims the prosecution did not disclose evidence on time			1
@entity9 's sentencing , originally scheduled for july 25 , has been pushed back			2
the case stems from an october 2009 ceremony in @entity37 , @entity7			1
prosecutors claimed that @entity9 's recklessness in operating the sweat lodge caused the deaths of @entity42 , 38 , of @entity43 , @entity44 ; @entity45 , 40 , of @entity46 ; and @entity47 , 49 , of @entity48 , @entity49			2
at least 15 others who took part in the sweat lodge ceremony became ill. more than 40 others were uninjured			0
prosecutors argued that the lodge , made of willow trees and branches and covered with tarpaulins and blankets , was heated to a perilously high temperature , causing the participants to suffer dehydration and heatstroke			0
they also said @entity9 did n't monitor the temperature inside the lodge or the well - being of participants and was indifferent to those clearly having trouble			0
@entity9 's lawyers countered that what happened was a tragic accident , not a crime			1
they asked witnesses who were in the sweat lodge whether they signed a release form warning them of the dangers			0
@entity78 replied that they signed , but some said they did n't read the form			0
@entity9 's attorneys also suggested that exposure to an unknown toxin in the lodge -- perhaps a pesticide , rat poison or something in the type of wood used to heat the rocks -- could have caused the deaths			2
event participants paid up to $ 10,000 to seek " new areas of consciousness " at the october 2009 @entity94 retreat in the desert , according to trial testimony			1
many had attended previous @entity101 seminars .			0
