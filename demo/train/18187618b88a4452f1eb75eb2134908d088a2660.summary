-- scientists say they are a step closer to recreating the conditions at the birth of the universe and to understanding life as we know it , after the successful collision of heavy lead ions in a massive machine in @entity11			1
this week , for the first time , ions were smashed together inside the @entity14 along the @entity16 and @entity17 border			1
until now , only protons had been collided in the experiment			2
the tiny particles ' lightning - fast collision promised to produce temperatures up to 100,000 times hotter than the sun , said @entity24 , a professor in experimental high - energy physics at @entity27 's @entity26 and one of hundreds of scientists involved in the project			2
" what we 're doing is reproducing the conditions that existed at the very early universe , a few millionths of a second after the @entity40 , " said @entity24 , referencing the cosmic explosion that many scientists believe spawned the universe from one minuscule particle			2
@entity41 , an acronym for @entity41 , is run through the @entity43 and involves physicists , engineers and technicians from around the world			0
many of these scientists will examine the aftereffects of this latest ion collision as they try to step back further to the universe 's emergence billions of years ago			0
the lead ion , @entity24 explained , is a lead atom that does not contain electrons -- thus , is more likely reflective of what matter existed in the millionths of a second after the @entity40			0
by combining more and more basic elements , scientists hope to better understand how various particles came together to create the modern - day universe and all it contains			1
" we hope to understand how we 're put together , how these ( basic ) constituents go on to make protons and neutrons , which in turn go on to make the atoms that you and i are made of , " @entity65 told @entity0			1
@entity77 after the @entity40 , there was a " hot soup " of particles called quarks and gluons at a temperature of around 2 trillion degrees above absolute zero , @entity73 , professor of physics at @entity75 , said last year			0
although they have never been directly seen , these particles are theoretically the building blocks of the bigger particles -- protons , neutrons and electrons -- that form the universe as we know it .			0

lead ions have collided for the first time inside a massive machine in @entity11
the collision is part of an experiment aiming to recreate @entity101 conditions
scientists are working with basic elements to understand how atoms came together
