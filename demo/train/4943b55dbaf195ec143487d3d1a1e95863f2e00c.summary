@entity0 -- @entity3 chief of staff gen. @entity2 is doing his best to avoid reporters since word leaked that he is the president 's top choice to be the next chairman of the @entity9			1
but there was no way he was going to duck questions from this group on friday so he charged right into a roomful of children , all of whom have lost fathers , and mothers and other relatives in war - time military service			1
the general shucked off his uniform coat , tuned up his singing voice for a rendition of his signature song from @entity27 , who was also known as the chairman of the board , and gave them a few lines			1
" start spreading the news , " he sang			0
the @entity2 show was on			1
he had an aide come out and hold the microphone while he did hand motions and sang " @entity37 " song -- " well there were green alligators , and long neck geese , some humped back camels and some chimpanzees ... " the questions and answers were also a hit			1
" i do have my own airplane and that 's pretty cool , " said @entity2			1
" four stars is pretty cool man , " he said			0
" second lieutenant was good too			0
" " what 's it like controlling so many soldiers ? " one child asked			0
" all we really have to do is give them the training ... and turn ' em loose , " he answered			0
easy - going laughs erupted , but not always			2
if he indeed gets the nomination for the @entity9 chairman post , @entity2 would be the senior ranking member of the armed forces			1
he would be the one who takes the drive across the @entity64 to meet with the president , carrying the advice of everyone in uniform to the commander in chief			0
but in some ways , facing this room may have seemed tougher than the @entity72			0
this was a crowd brought together for @entity75 weekend just outside @entity0 by @entity76 , @entity77 , an organization that helps military kids as young as 4 cope with loss and grief			2
" that is such a good question , and the question was , how do you keep people from dying , " @entity2 said , repeating what had been too soft to hear			1
" sometimes we ca n't , ( keep them from dying ) , " he told his young audience			0
" because when you grow up and you 're going to have to fight someone -- i think they answer is we try to get them ready as best we can , because sometimes @entity93 actually has another plan , " @entity2 said			1
before saying goodbye to the children , he led a rendition of " @entity97			2
" soldiers in the crowd , some wearing t - shirts that read " @entity99 , " rose to their feet			2
the crowd belted out the lyrics			0
" first to fight for the right , and to build the nation 's might			0
the @entity97 , " the group sung .			2
