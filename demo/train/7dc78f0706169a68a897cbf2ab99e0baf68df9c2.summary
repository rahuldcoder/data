now has " sustainable access to safe drinking water " was described by secretary general ban ki - moon as a " great achievement for the people of the world			1
" meeting part of the target of one of the @entity2 's @entity16 ( @entity16 ) ahead of the 2015 deadline was " a testament to all those who see ( them ) not as a dream , but as a vital tool , " he added			1
but the goal of universal access to clean water is far from complete says @entity26 , program officer for @entity27			1
" reaching the last 10 % of the population -- those living in remote rural areas and on the fringes of big cities -- will become increasingly difficult and expensive , " @entity26 said			0
furthermore , he says , the @entity16 on basic sanitation are unlikely to be met before 2025			1
it 's an area which the @entity2 concedes is " lagging far behind " the millennium commitments , with 2.5 billion people ( including one billion children ) still exposed to poor sanitation and one child dying every 20 seconds as a consequence , the @entity2 estimates			1
but hope that this horrifying statistic can be eradicated is being fueled by technology which is helping monitor water supplies more quickly and efficiently			2
@entity47 - based @entity46 is helping lead the charge in this area with the development of a new system called @entity52 ( @entity53 )			0
opinion : ' the @entity55 ' the mobile technology android - based system uses camera and gps to collect information on wells and pumps			2
these then link to a web - based dashboard where survey data can be tracked on @entity65 and @entity66 , according to @entity46			0
" lots of organizations do monitoring and that 's great , but it tends to be a very slow process , " said @entity67 , water for @entity70 's senior manager of programmatic data			1
" this is something that ( can be done in ) real time			0
you can look at the data as soon as it 's collected , allowing organizations to make really quick decisions , " she added			0
the @entity86 government , in partnership with the @entity89 's @entity88 , has already put it to good use @entity67 says , mapping 10,000 water points during 2011			2
various countries are experimenting with mobile monitoring , which could play a vital role in solving long - term sanitation issues , @entity27 's @entity26 says			1
the secret life of drinking water " it reduces the cost of data collection and hopefully reduces the downtime			2
i think the @entity2 estimates that one in three water pumps are not working at any given moment -- that 's a shocking number , " @entity26 said			1
water for people recently teamed up with @entity109 , a @entity111 open source software company , to help develop the flow 's ( now officially called @entity52 ) features and international reach			2
twelve years ago , when it inaugurated its mdgs for @entity115 , the @entity2 stated : " improvements in sanitation are bypassing the poor			1
" today , little appears to have changed			0
" water sanitation is a harder goal to get to			1
there just are n't enough ngos out there to put a latrine in every household , " @entity67 said			0
but efforts to shift the emphasis away from traditional methods of improving sanitation to simple technology - based ones might pay dividends			0
" traditionally , there have been a lot of reasons why organizations do n't want to monitor -- too expensive , too time - consuming and too difficult to do , " @entity67 said			0
" the aim of flow is to remove some of those barriers and create something that is easy to use			0

despite improvements in clean water supply , @entity2 says sanitation still " lagging far behind "
one child dies every 20 seconds because of poor water sanitation according to the @entity2
new water monitoring techniques using mobile phones can speed up *maintenance* and save lives
